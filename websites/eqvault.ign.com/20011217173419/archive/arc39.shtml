Alan was around on the Gameplay Board lot today and discussed many topics:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049194.html"><b>The Word "Gay" Acceptable?</b></a><br>Isladar_PK wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Everyone I have heard in the last few years since high school have always said 'damn that book was gay' or 'my teacher gave me some gay ass homework'. That is just how people talk now!]</i></font><br><br>Right. And that is certainly how the word is used now. But look at the meaning you are giving it. <br><br>In your examples, &#8216;gay&#8217; = &#8216;bad&#8217;. <br><br>But there is a portion of our society that also use &#8216;gay&#8217; to mean homosexual. <br><br>And, therefore, it can be very offensive to some people to simply use &#8216;gay&#8217; to mean &#8216;bad&#8217;. <br><br>So that common usage that you might see every day (I have a good friend that is a schoolteacher, I like to check with him on what&#8217;s hip these days&#8230;), it&#8217;s not polite. Using that word that way you are essentially calling all homosexuals bad. <br><br>I&#8217;m all for bringing back the use of the word gay to mean happy, myself.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049172.html"><b>Druid Talk</b></a><br>Eventually I&#8217;d like to do one of these for every class. I know, your first question is going to be, how did I decide to pick druids to be next? Well, honestly, it just came up in conversation today with a co-worker. There&#8217;s no trick to it. I would certainly address the ones most in need first, but until I&#8217;ve actually done all these posts, I won&#8217;t know which is most in need&#8230; (let&#8217;s not make that the topic of this post, please) <br><br>So the question is, what is it that the druid community thinks they need to become a &#8216;balanced&#8217; class? What is lacking? What is over-powered? - yes, that&#8217;s a valid question for any class &#8211; <br><br>This time I&#8217;m starting this post with very little information to lead with, so I feel like I&#8217;m at a bit of a disadvantage. I do know that, like many other classes, some druids feel that they don&#8217;t have enough to do while at the final encounter of the big raid. One of the suggestions to change that falls along the same lines as one proposed by the shaman community, changing/improving their healing abilities post 50. <br><br>I want you to understand that I think druids are pretty well balanced all around, and I really see little that needs to be changed (and that&#8217;s partially why I picked them to be the topic today&#8230;). So you&#8217;ll have to be convincing, logical and articulate to convince me. :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049165.html"><b>An Apology?</b></a><br>Closing this post for two reasons. Firstly, well, the original post is pretty nasty and doesn&#8217;t warrant comment anyhow. <br><br>But I&#8217;m also closing it because I&#8217;m not going to allow threads to become personal attacks on other posters. Those of you that have issues with each other, please take them elsewhere. This board is for the discussion of issues about EverQuest. Complain about Verant or the game, or praise us if you want. But I don&#8217;t want to see any more attacks on people. Consider this a warning shot from an over-caffeinated Absor. But the next step is polite warnings, and then real warnings. <br><br>I understand that some people just don&#8217;t get along, that&#8217;s human nature. But try to keep from assaulting each other.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049124.html"><b>Blackouts</b></a><br>Not only have they not happened here, but we have a huge generator attached to the buiding like a leech... <br><br>So if the power goes out, my CD player will at least keep going.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049053.html"><b>More Patch Information</b></a><br>Ok, things get a little confusing in here around patch day. I wanted to clear up one item that was put into the patch message that wasn&#8217;t completely accurate. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - Last week's patch attempted to fix Celestial Elixir, Celestial Healing, and Torpor, so that they would stack another similar spell, unintentionally causing it to stop stacking with standard regeneration spells. This has been fixed. The downside to this fix is that these spells will now overwrite the "Call of Bones" series. As the three former spells are cast to save a character's life, this solution appears to be the most beneficial for all of those involved.]</i></font> <br><br>We&#8217;re looking at this one again. Due to the fact that at least some of us thought this was going to work one way and other another, we&#8217;ll have to go over it again&#8230; <br><br>But, as it is in game now, Celestial Elixir, Celestial Healing and Torpor will stack with most regenerative-type spells. The will NOT overwrite Call of Bones, Lich or the DoT lifetap spells. The heal over time spells will not take hold on someone with those spell lines up. That&#8217;s how it works at the moment. As I said, we&#8217;re giving the whole thing one more review.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048800.html"><b>Link Dead</b></a><br>OscuroCorazon wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As you all know you can still be hit when LD. Well you might or might not know, you cannot be healed, buffed, or saved in anyway while LD. This is extremely unfair. We should not be able to be killed when we have no control over our char. It doesn't seem right that we can be pounded but not healed. Half the zone wend LD the other night, and many of us died. Guide would not rez. (i understand the policies he has to follow) He might not even have been bothered if the cleric in my group could have healed me.]</i></font> <br><br>You have to look at the whole thing here, not just the bad thing that happened to you (though it is a bummer). <br><br>If people were untouchable when link dead, then people would go link dead a lot more than they do now. When fighting a dangerous opponent and about to lose, players would suddenly go link dead. They would become immune and would be safe from any risk of death. <br><br>But rather than just leaving you in game to suffer as a helpless player character when you go link dead, we&#8217;ve set it up so that you become an non-player character when you go link dead (which is why you can&#8217;t be healed). So you will at least gain the benefit of the non-player character AI and your character will defend itself when the player can&#8217;t do it. <br><br>The current setup seems to be the best solution. <br><br>lagacy_lovemaster wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: you can bandage a LD player .... if that helps]</i></font><br><br>You can? That&#8217;s odd&#8230; are you sure about that? Because, from what I know, you should not be able to bandage a link dead player character.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048728.html"><b>Class Balance</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Who is going to make your squad, and why?]</i></font><br><br>Which of them have I grouped with before, and what did I think of them? <br><br>Which of them is the smartest player? <br><br>Which of them makes me laugh the hardest? <br><br>Answer those questions, and I'll pick my group...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048625.html"><b>Zone Modifers</b></a><br>carmageddon wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;We all know what zones are gonna be upped exp wise ( it still isnt gonna make anyone go to kerra isle or eruds crossing though) but are any zones gonna get xp modifier decreased?

Please tell us ahead of time yes or no, whether popular spots like lake of ill omen might get modifier downgrades too. Thank you.&#8221;]</i></font> <br><br>No, we are not reducing the zone experience modifier in any zones. And, well, we did announce that hybrids will be losing more experience on death&#8230; (of course now I need to explain that they will also be gaining experience at a faster rate that offsets that increase in death penalty, so that it won&#8217;t be taken out of context).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048634.html"><b>On Suggestion for Full Screen Mode</b></a><br>You can make the chat window background any color and nearly any opacity that you wish using the /chatwindow command.

Today's new patch message is up on the Patch Server:<UL>January 17th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Baltimore Fan Faire - Last Chance*<br><br>Monday is the registration deadline for the Baltimore Fan Faire! We are almost sold out so hurry and visit <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html</a> before you miss your chance to attend this event!<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>The primary focus of today's patch is to implement changes noted in the new Producer's Letter which can be found at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml">http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml</a><br><br>It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you read the Producer's Letter before playing EverQuest.  It contains some unprecedented and exciting enhancements to gameplay.<br><br>In addition to these changes, the following changes have been implemented:<br><br>*Bug Fixes*<br><br>- Fixed a bug that caused "root" and "snare" type spells to function incorrectly when stacked.  They should now stack properly.<br>- Fixed a bug that negated the "instrument modifier" for bards using Selo's, causing them to run slower than they otherwise would. <br>- Fixed a bug that allowed two or more spells that grant levitation to stack.  Levitation spells should not stack.<br>- The "Track Corpse" spell now works.<br>- Tracked down and eliminated several bugs that were causing a very small percentage of people to crash when zoning or upon entering the game.<br>- Fixed a problem with some Ulthork armor that caused it to disappear on death if the wearer was of extremely low level.<br>- Tserrina's Whip has been fixed.  If you received one prior to today's patch, you will need to trade out your whip with a GM in order to get one that works correctly.<br>- Last week's patch attempted to fix Celestial Elixir, Celestial Healing, and Torpor, so that they would stack another similar spell, unintentionally causing it to stop stacking with standard regeneration spells.  This has been fixed.  The downside to this fix is that these spells will now overwrite the "Call of Bones" series.  As the three former spells are cast to save a character's life, this solution appears to be the most beneficial for all of those involved. <br>- The stronger /lootnodrop options will no longer prompt you for confirmation when looting your own corpse.  It is highly suggested that everyone reset their option to the strongest security available: /lootnodrop ALWAYS (always ask for confirmation).<br>- Added some code to address an issue reported by a few players, that being that an NPC named "Ragefire" would die and not leave a corpse.  Though we were unable to reproduce this problem in testing, the code we added should function as a catch-all for this problem.  Please be sure to let us know how this goes.<br><br><br>*Changes/Enhancements*<br><br>- While not mentioned in the Producer's Letter, the Zone Experience Modifier has also been increased in Guk (guktop), by roughly 12%.<br>- "Lay on Hands" has been enhanced again to heal more hitpoints.<br>- Overlooked in the last patch message, new spells were made available to Rangers and Paladins in the upper levels.  <br>- "Voice of the Berserker", a beneficial spell, no longer drains mana over the duration of the spell.<br>- The maximum duration of "Strength of Nature" has been increased.<br>- A new spell for magicians is now available in game.<br>- The "Shield of the Eighth" spell will now last a number of minutes equal to your level.<br>- You can now use the arrow and enter keys to select characters in the character select screen.  In addition, the last character you chose will be automatically hilighted when entering that screen.  This value is stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file as "LastCharSel=0-7"<br>- The ranger's "Trueshot" discipline has had its damage increased after analyzing data from its fix last week.  Prior to the last patch, all bows, while under the discipline, were hitting as if they were 45dmg bows regardless of the delay. Last week's patch fixed it so that damage was based on the damage of the bow.  This weeks patch increases damage bonuses in relation to delay (longer delays yield better damage bonuses). <br>- You can now reverse the left and right channels on your speakers using the /reversesound command.  This should be very useful for those who have had to place their speakers backwards due to cable lengths.<br>- Made some improvements to Paw, Mistmoore, and The Hole, to address some concerns brought forth by the players.  Both zones had some problems that would cause them to be exceedingly difficult in some cases.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Dolar!

Much was talked about on the boards by Alan today.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048612.html"><b>Corpse Poofing and Ragefire </b></a><br>I just wanted to update you all on our research into this whole Ragefire and other corpse poofing thing. <br><br>We&#8217;ve been trying to replicate the poofing of Ragefire, both on Test and on live servers. A lot of tests, using methods provided by players, and we can&#8217;t replicate it. <br><br>However, we are adding some additional catch-all type code that should prevent Ragefire from poofing. That will go in with the patch tonight. <br><br>So I&#8217;d be grateful if you could let me know if you continue to see this happening after the patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048592.html"><b>About Paw</b></a><br>In our campaign to make some areas more appealing, we have increased the experience modifier in Guk Top as well as all the others previously mentioned. Experience in that zone will be increased by about 12%. <br><br>Also, we&#8217;ve made some small changes to Paw that will make it much more player friendly. You&#8217;ll have to check it out to see exactly what was changed, but we think you&#8217;ll like it. <br><br>(heh, note the subtle attempt to convince the players to go to Paw and look at it! I&#8217;m so sneaky.)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048554.html"><b>XP Based on Levels in Groups</b></a><br>Steevin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: For example, I'm a level 45 Bard. I'm grouped with a level 43 Cleric and a level 47 Warrior. We kill a mob worth 10,000XP. How is that divided between the three of us, and why?]</i></font><br><br>Well, the nice thing about the changes happening tonight is that it&#8217;s now very easy to tell what portion of the experience you will gain from a group. I&#8217;ll use your example: <br><br>Total levels = 135<br>Total experience given = 10,000 <br><br>The 45th level character (it does not matter what class he is) will get 45/135*10,000 experience, that&#8217;s 3,333 (DO NOT ask me to tell you how the experience system rounds off, I&#8217;m not going to even ask about it&#8230;) <br><br>The 43rd level character will get 43/135*10,000 = 3,185 <br><br>And the 47th level character will get 47/135*10,000 = 3,481 <br><br>Let&#8217;s check the math: 3,333+3,185+3.481= 9,999&#8230; ok, I lost a point someplace&#8230; <br><br>But, basically, the only thing you will need to take into consideration if you are worrying about experience distribution when choosing group members is their level.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048512.html"><b>Class Balance</b></a><br>Tween wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Aradune said in the Producer's Letter that doing away with the class experience penalties brings them one step closer to class balance. He also said that, though 100% of the population will never be able to agree that the classes are balanced, they hope to bring them all to a point soon where the largest issues are offset by other advantages... or something like that.]</i></font> <br><br>That&#8217;s very accurate. <br><br>Basically, we feel that the classes are very close to balanced. Heck, one of the main things that was out of balance was the class experience charts. But just because we&#8217;ve fixed that does not mean we are done. We may move slowly, but we will get there. No class is &#8216;closed&#8217; for changes and adjustments. We want to reach that point sooner rather than later. But we&#8217;ll let you know when we feel we are there.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048476.html"><b>Fishing Nerfed!</b></a><br>I just don't know if I should laugh or cry...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048252-3.html"><b>Changes an Insult to Hybrid Classes?</b></a><br>Ovilian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How many of you flaming morons have actually played a hybred. Yes the bred comes from breed not brid, idiot. The reason I am complaining is because this is a complete ripp-off.]</i></font> <br><br>Firstly, the spelling is hybrid, not hybred, regardless of your claims to the contrary. <br><br>And, while I usually don&#8217;t justify such overly nasty posts with responses, someplace in there you have a legitimate point. <br><br>We talked a bit about this reaction. We knew that some customers would probably feel a bit cheated by this change. Some of you have indeed played up to a high level under the auspices of the experience charts, and the fact that we are effectively evened those charts might seem to somehow cheapen your accomplishment. <br><br>But keep in mind that, since release anyway, a hybrid has never paid the cost of his or her experience chart whenever grouped. That burden was always placed on his group. So it is hard for me to accept any argument about how we have somehow reduced the value of the accomplishment made by a hybrid to level, except for those that helped him getting those levels. And there really is no way that I can think of that we could give those lost experience points back to the group members that help you earn them. <br><br>My apologies for the slight sarcasm there, but I felt it was warranted. <br><br>What we have done, though, is made it so that from this day forward, no group will be able to exclude you because you cost them experience points. I think this far outweighs any perceived slight or loss of esteem that might or might not come from this change. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You morons are missing the point&#8230;]</i></font> <br><br>I need to ask you to stop calling people names. This is something that we do not allow on these boards. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We earned our levels unlike you, through deaths, corpse runs, and being turned away from groups because of our class.]</i></font> <br><br>The only way that you mention in which you actually had a harder time than anyone else is in finding groups. This is what we are fixing with this patch&#8230; <br><br>Sterol_sk said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I mostly agree with the original poster, verant needs to find some way to REWARD all 50+ hybrids for basically playing a broken game for the past two years.]</i></font> <br><br>I&#8217;m honestly baffled by this. Unless you soloed your way up to 50+, it was not you that paid the penalty for our &#8216;broken&#8217; game, it was your group members. <br><br>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I can tell you that I truly do see how you might feel somewhat&#8230; let down (I guess that&#8217;s the right word)&#8230; about how we are changing this so late in your gameplay. I really do, I think all of us do. But despite the reality of that feeling, not all feelings are based on logic. Yes, every time you soloed you were struggling against a larger experience chart than others. But when you grouped you were benefiting from that chart while your group struggled under it. <br><br>I&#8217;m not saying that your feelings are wrong, feelings can&#8217;t really be wrong. But I&#8217;m asking you to see the bigger picture. I know that most of you want this change far more than you want to hold on to any feeling of having earned your high experience cost levels. And be assured that we understand that feeling (not a few of us play hybrids here, to high level as well). <br><br>icebreakerDarkmoore <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ovilian your a selfabsorbed idiot..]</i></font> <br><br>Again, let&#8217;s lay off the name calling. If, for some reason, you think that calling him names is acceptable just because he had a nasty tone to his post, you are incorrect. I didn&#8217;t read all the posts here in detail, but the same warning goes for all that have done this. And, well, I&#8217;m going to close this thread since it has degenerated into a bit more of a name-calling contest than I like. If someone wants to continue the pertinent parts of this discussion in a new thread, please do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048475-2.html"><b>More on Huge Changes</b></a><br>Qwase wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ok, just a question. <br>If I have my friend the 56 SK go a die like 50 times, and wait to res him after the patch. Will he get extra XP since his lost XP will be calculated with diferent numbers?]</i></font><br><br>Sorry, no. We thought of that one too, and we&#8217;re making sure that doesn&#8217;t happen. :)  You will get experience upon resurrection based on the way you were receiving experience on death. So if you die before the patch, resurrection after the patch will give you the same experience return that it would have before the patch. <br><br>Drysart wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I believe they've said the new experience system is up on the Test Server right now.]</i></font><br><br>/em waves at Drysart <br><br>Yup.

The &#8216;penalty&#8217; is completely gone. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you group or not, there will no longer be any more experience needed for one class over another, with the exception of the Warrior and Rogue, which will get a slight bonus. The experience change for hybrids and other over-costed classes is a separate thing from the group experience bonus. <br><br>Mai029 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think these changes are great Now I can finally have my Pally shout out for a group and not be responded by the ominous sound of Crickets chirping.]</i></font><br><br>Verant is unfair to crickets.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047576.html"><b>Why can't Y= Yes and N= No? </b></a><br>I'll mention the Y or N thing.

Several new articles were posted today in a variety of sections here at the EQVault:<UL><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid979684743,53286,"><b>The State of Healing in the Post 50 Game</a> - By Rolli Polli </b><br>On one hand we have druids and shamans who say that their heals are inadequate for fighting creatures that can do 200 points of damage a swing, and usually double or triple hit. The only way to successfully fight creatures like that is to have a cleric periodically cast complete healing on a warrior. In one extreme example, three shamans that were all level 53 to 60 could not provide the healing power of one 50th level cleric. The reason is that the 53rd level healing spell, superior heal, fizzles a great deal making it ineffective and the only other option is the 29th level healing spell, greater heal. Any shaman or druid trying to keep up with the healing requirements of a post 50 group would soon be out of mana. If you&#8217;re in Sebilis and the group&#8217;s cleric has to go, everybody else might as well leave too. So druids and shamans need better healing spells.<br><br><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid979685073,17227,"><b>Soulfire Chapters 1-4</a> - By Roger Wright </b><br>&#8220;She was turned, infected with the curse of the wolf, made into a werewolf. There is only one way to free her.&#8221; Nyxx laid the large scroll down on the table and tried to unroll it but her hands would not cooperate. Kel gently moved her hands aside and carefully unrolled the scroll. On the scroll was the face of a beautiful woman dressed in a beautiful gossamer gown. She was a striking woman.

Almost instantaneously, the portal faded to nothing and a final clap of thunder could be heard, seemingly miles away.

Electric Games has their <a href="http://www.electricgames.com/reviews/e/everquestsov.html">review of Velious</a> up and online.  They award the second EQ expansion with a 4/5 star rating.  Here's the bottom line according to the reviewer:<ul>New graphics effects and interface are excellent. The layout of the zones are designed to force the player to use much more strategy than before. The pack is for mid to high level players seeking a challenge. Low level or casual players will not get nearly enough, if any, benefit from this expansion. </ul>

This report was brought to us by Cadsuane Meladhrin:<blockquote> While on a forray into the filthy lair of the Splitpaw gnolls to obtain spells for our necromancers today, we encountered an Iksar monk by the name of Master Vyyth Swiftscale deep in the bowels of the dungeon.  He beseeched us to aid him in locating the paladin Brother Hayle so he could be 'freed'.<br> <br> While some were weary about aiding a follower of Cazic Thule on such a benevolent mission, we agreed anyway, if for no other reason that to find out the Iksar's true motives.  Upon arriving at the entrance to the jail holding the Qeynos paladin, he made his those intentions clear:  He was to destroy Brother Hayle.  Being an open-minded group of adventurers we decided to listen to his motives before making the decision on whether or not to aid him.  He sat down and told us a story of a pact of Gods and betrayal (the log of which I will have linked up shortly).  Being Gods with similar motives, he explained a secret pact made between Innoruuk and Cazic, overseen by the Tribunal, to spread the glory of the deities across the face of Norrath.  This began with the opening of terror in the Kithicor Woods and was to continue with the razing of Qeynos.  To this end, Cazic Thule sent his son as an avatar to give him the city.  This son was Brother Hayle.  Overcome by fear, Brother Hayle decided to turn his back on his father, and sided with the Paladins of Qeynos, becoming one of them.  Enraged by this turn of events, Cazic Thule banished his son to the festering cave of Infected Paw.  However times are changing, and Brother Hayle's death has become necessary to fulfill the pact made by Cazic Thule and Innoruuk.<br> <br>After hearing his story we were shocked.  Everyone's reaction was different.  The paladins stalwartly insisted that no harm come to Brother Hayle.  The Iksar and Tier'Dal viewed his death as a holy mission, and the key to unleashing the glory of their deities onto the face of Norrath. Worshippers of Fizzlethorpe could not see past the irony of the situation, thinking it all a great joke.  The godless among us scoffed at the entire situation, disdaining meddling in the affairs of the supposed 'Gods'.<br> <br>In the confusion that ensued, Master Vyyth ran for the jail.  The paladins and others attempted to block his entry into the cell, bodily, but the slippery lizard managed to dart past them.  It was then that Brother Hayle was confronted and defeated by Master Vyyth, along with some present, as others watched in horror, knowing they were powerless to save the paladin.<br><br>Master Vyyth left with cryptic words of returning to the Plane of Fear to report to his Master.  One can only speculate at what, if anything, may arise from these developments.

They are contradicting themselves."]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, that's simple. <br><br>You'll notice that even before the proposed changes to the way experience is given, people were playing more costly classes. Why? <br><br>Because they wanted to. <br><br>We've been working very hard to balance the classes. Therefore losing the experience penalty for them makes sense. We've made no effort, nor do we plan to as far as I know, to 'balance' the classes, expect by use of their experience penalty. <br><br>I really don't think that the existing experience cost for races will keep people from playing those races, where the combination of race AND class experience costs could certainly have done so. <br><br>And, really, the essence of this whole thing is that there is a reason to balance the races with extra experience costs, and there is no reason to do so for the classes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047824.html"><b>Absor Responsible For Big Changes?</b></a><br>Evangolis wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Since Absor has started his job, Verant has introduced the most sweeping changes seen since beta, many of them completely unexpected. <br><br>Therefore, based on available evidence, that must be Absor's responsibility. <br><br>Note - I'm being sarcastic here.

But few of them were my idea (especially not the coolest ones). I really wish I could take credit for all of this stuff, but I can't. I can say that I've been cheering on those with the best ideas, if that counts. <br><br>To answer the original question, a lot of what I do is run down people to ask questions about specific concerns that the players have brought up. And, sadly, a lot of it is simply trying to understand those concerns and write them up in the most coherent way I can. But the largest use of my time is reading. These boards, class boards, fan sites... <br><br>There's a lot of players out there, and a lot of them are trying to make themselves heard. I try to make sure that I've read as many of those concerns as I can. <br><br>Perhaps speed reading classes would be a good use of my free time. :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047421.html"><b>Guild Purge</b></a><br>You should contact your GM about the problem with your guild.

Brad McQuaid, who from the looks of it likes working on 3 day weekends ;), fired off a post on the Gameplay Board <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047827.html">concerning server population issues</a>:<UL><i>Hi all,<br><br>I wanted to bring up this issue officially and also talk about some aspects of it, and how we are looking to solve some of the issues.<br><br>First of all, we are working to come up with a new target server population at peak hours number. Our inclination at this point is a number somewhere between 2300 and 2500 players during peak hours. We feel we need to adjust this number because of how much Velious has added to EverQuest's size and quantity of content.<br><br>We also feel that undercrowding is probably more detrimental to the game than overcrowding, in that while crowded areas are frustrating in that there is greater competition involved, there are some advantages to it (help from others when an encounter goes bad, help with CRs, etc.). (No, I'm not saying Overcrowding is good overall -- so please don't misunderstand me). Undercrowding, however, can mean a player can't find anyone to play with, and thus leaves. In other words, that frustration can be worse.<br><br>There have also been some problems with packet loss and link death, specifically on E'Ci, when populations are growing high.<br><br>So, what are we going to do about all of this? <br>Well, before launching new servers we're going continue to analyze where players are at, what zones are crowded, and what zones are underused. Significant experience bonuses are going in next patch for underused zones (mostly dungeons). <br><br>With E'Ci specifically we found out that after a recent hardware change, the network interface was incorrectly configured -- last night this was fixed, so please tell us if anything has improved.<br><br>Also, when there are network problems out there with the Internet and a large group of players go link dead, this can cause zones to go down. We are working on this issue as well.<br><br>So, there you have it, both gameplay and hardware solutions we hope will have significant effect. And please understand that any hesitation to launch new servers is due to undercrowding fears only -- if after these adjustments and attempts to better utilize all the zones we have it turns out target populations are lower than we believed, we will launch new servers, both split and new.<br><br>thanks, and we look forward to your comments and feedback.<br><br>-Brad</i></ul>

Brad McQuaid and Gordon Wrinn announced monumental changes to the world of EverQuest this evening on the Gameplay Board.  The post weighs over 5 pages and it is <b>highly recommended</b> that you read it all, as it will affect everyone in some way.  Because of it's length, and at the request of Gordon, I will only be posting the intro and summary in this post.  For the complete read <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840.html"><b>please click on this link</b></a>.<br><br>Here's the intro:<ul><i>Hi all,<P>The following is the new Producer's Letter, which will be posted to everquest.com on Tuesday.  I wanted to get it up on the message boards sooner so you all can get the word out, and because you guys are where we get most of our feedback and deserve a little advanced info now and then   :)<P>These are BIG changes, and are a summary of reactions to months of thought and a ton of feedback.  I don't think we've made changes this fundamental since beta, so cross your fingers and read on:<P>---------------<P>January 14, 2001<P><br>Hello all,<P>Since the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious, the EverQuest Live team has been working on a number of things, from addressing issues in Velious to adding additional content to other portions of the world.  At this same time, we've been working towards a point where we can stop tweaking class-based abilities, and declare with confidence that they are as "balanced" as we can make them.<P>It is a foregone conclusion that the diversity of EverQuest's population will never let us reach a point where everyone will be perfectly satisfied with their class's abilities, as nearly every change we make tends to bother some people while pleasing others.  Still, we are confident that we can reach a point where problems in our current game systems can be reduced to the point that those left are either negligible in their impact, or offset inversely by a similar problem affecting gameplay in an opposite direction.  We're nearly there, but following heated debate and the review of material and opinions sent in by the players, we've decided to make some exciting and unprecedented changes to a game system that has remained intact since release:  the experience system itself.  <P>While the EverQuest Message-board FAQ states that the experience system is not subject to post-production changes, it also explains that as developers of an ongoing MMORPG in a dynamic world, there are times that we need to be flexible and address issues as necessary.  Though it has always been our goal to avoid changes to core systems whenever possible, our additional goal of finalizing class balance takes precedence in this case.  <br> <br>We're going to depart from our usual method of releasing information by giving everyone some specific information in regards to how these systems currently work, and how they will work after the patch.  It is very important to us that everyone understands our goals, and the fact that these changes are helpful to all of the players.  We can only do that by giving you the details necessary for you to draw your own conclusions.</i></ul>As I stated, this is a gigantic read.  I recommend that you read it, but for those who don't have time or just want the details quick here's the summary Gordon provided:<ul><P><b>Summary</b><P>The changes that we are making in the next patch should have a profound impact upon the game:<br><blockquote><ul><br><li>Classes no longer have a true class-based experience penalty, making it easier for people to play the class that they want to play, rather than the class that they feel compelled to play due to faster advancement.  </li><P><li>Race based penalties are no longer shared with the group, and in truth are not severe enough to greatly impact the advancement speed of any particular race.  Even the race with the worst penalty will level no slower than a human monk does now, and in truth will level faster due to the other changes that went in.  </li><P><li>The grouping bonus increase, in addition to the other changes, makes grouping much more efficient, without reducing the current efficiency of soloing for those who prefer that route.</li><P><li>Experience modifiers turned up in the other zones should encourage people to spread out, have more fun, and allow those staying behind in other areas to have more fun themselves since the area is less crowded.</li><P><li>All players, assuming that they have an experience penalty, or ever group with anyone who does, will level faster.</li><br></ul></blockquote><br>Many of these changes are quite involved in regards to their implementation, and as such we want to be sure that everyone interested understands them.  Alan "Absor" VanCouvering will be happy to answer any questions that you may have on the EverQuest Message boards.  Until then, we sincerely hope that these changes will help all players, whether "uber" or "causal", experience and enjoy EverQuest to their greatest potential. <P>For Brad McQuaid, Jeff Butler, and every dedicated member of the EverQuest Team,<P><br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Associate Producer, EQLive<br>Sony Online Entertainment</ul>

Anyone found attacking a GM or Guide may be banished from the Arena or death touched without warning. <br><br>The Arena is off limits to unauthorized PvP 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after the event. This is to ensure that the contestants and spectators are safe. <br><br>Spectators shall remain seated and not casting during the match. Any spell casting shall be considered aimed at a participant, and either harmful or helpful to someone in the match. Anyone who casts any spells (including Bard songs) during a match can be death touched and removed from the Arena. <br><br>Spectators shall not use /shout for any reason, but use /ooc instead. This is so that those involved in the match use /shout, and the channel can be turned off to reduce distraction to the contestants involved. Use of /shout at anytime can result in a silence command being issued, rendering the player unable to use any form of communication, or banishment from the Arena. <br><br>Spectators shall not interfere with this event. Severe penalties are used only when directly attacking a player involved in the match, attacking a judge during the match, or healing a player involved in a match. <br><br>VI may limit the amount of people in the zone to control conditions of lag or frame rate for the participants. The event shall start open seating, but may close off at any time. The Event Staff may use any sort of decision on who stays and who leaves to ensure the event is a success. This should not be implemented until a minimum of 150 players in the zone has been reached. <br><br>AoE Spells ARE allowed in game. This has the potential of killing off some of the younger spectators, if you are killed by one of these spells please pull corpse out of the PvP area and await for a GM or guide to give you a res.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Combatant Rules <br><br><br>An entry fee of 5,000 platinum pieces will be required per 7 man teams. Money is to be giving to an Event Coordinator and is due before the first match. Teams may waive the fees with the understanding of waiving the prizes. <br><br>7 Man teams can be made up of any races/class combination of levels 52 or greater. Only 6 may compete per match and teams may switch out any team member for the 7th player between matches. The 7th man out is free to coach his teammates from the side lines/top of throne and will be allowed to use any in game channels to do so. <br><br>Spells that are NOT allowed: Fear, Charm, and any Gravity Spells. Knock back spells ARE allowed. <br><br>With an exception to items with activatable properties, all items, weapons, and armor will be allowed in this event. Activatable items of any kind may only be used for stat bonuses and processes. The right clickable effects are prohibited and will result in disqualification if used. <br><br>In the event that the combat exceeds 30 minutes of RL time then the Event Staff will cast an AoE Snare spell in the direct center of the platform every 2 minutes until the combat is over. <br><br>The top of the throne is off limit to the combatants during the matches, the only people that may use the top of the throne are the 7th person of the teams and any press that are allowed to witness the match.<br><br>Any use of exploits or bugs will result in immediate disqualification from the event, and is a break in the rules of conduct as set forth on www.everquest.com. <br><br>Rallos Zek Specific Rule : There shall be no looting of any item at an event, this includes spectators. Anyone found player killing for profit at an event shall have action taken against their account. <br><br>Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek Rule : You may request to have your faction restored to the condition it was in at the last available save. This is to ensure that no unnecessary faction hits are taken at an event.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Test Server Finals <br><br>Those champions who go to Test are bound by additional rules: The character used for the event cannot adventure on Test for any reason. Handing off even the smallest items to a player on Test is considered duplication, resulting in a warning against the account, and loss of that item on your home server. Those found extremely abusing this rule can have further actions taken against the account at the discretion of the EQ development team. <br><br>The transfer of characters to Test is midnight (give or take an hour) PST the night before the main event. <br><br>Lake Rathetear will be shut down several hours before the main event. The only characters allowed in the Arena on Test for the main event will be the champions, the judges of the event and the event staff, other members of Verant Interactive, and members of the press who signed up with Lady Daegarmo at least three days in advance via email. <br><br>All other characters on test found in the Arena during the main event will be summoned out of the zone and bound so they cannot return. If a second character is found to enter the Arena for any reason, it could be considered disruption and subject to action taken against the account. <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Lady Daegarmo, Ozzmar, Dartok</i></UL>

Then, yes, you are right. If we break something, it's a bug. If we look at it and decide to leave it that way, AND it is a reduction in the effectiveness of something, then it becomes a 'nerf'. I can accept that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Hence ANY change to ANY aspect of the bard, whether or NOT an actual nerf or bug, will forever more be considered a "Nerf."]</i></font><br><br>No, it won't. If you choose to be incorrect in your understanding of the terms that we (you, me and the rest of the people active on this board) use daily, then that's fine. But it will be a constant source of misunderstandings between you and the rest of us. By your definition, if we were to double the effects of all bard songs tomorrow morning, we would be nerfing bards. And the drum thing is a bug (heh, and I'm guessing that doubling the effects of all bard songs would be a bug too&#8230;). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In otherwords, it's a NERF until you fix it.]</i></font> <br><br>I guess I'm taking time to respond to this post because you hit one of my touchy spots. I'm a firm believer in the idea that in order to communicate you have to establish terminology. And I am also very convinced that some terms carry with them implications that have to be carefully applied. The term 'nerf' is obviously one of those. I've been watching it evolve as it refers to EverQuest for a while now (from day one, really). And it was at one time used very specifically, it meant something then. It was used to describe a reduction in the effectiveness of something that the speaker thought was extreme. It has evolved now to mean just about any reduction in the effectiveness of something, whether extreme or not. That bugs me a bit, but at least it still has a solidly understood meaning, even if it still carries with it all the negative energy that it had when it was only used to mean that something had been made too ineffective. <br><br>But, well, lately it's been used all over the place. I kinda like the word myself. It's really a solid part of the EverQuest community (even if it is a sort of curse word&#8230; :)). Try to stick to definitions that everyone understands, or you will become less and less comprehensible as you go along.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047510.html"><b>Bard Issues</b></a><br>Sorry everyone, I seem to have snarfed up my computer somehow last night. Luckily Akriss went home sick (well, kinda lucky) and I'm abusing his computer at the moment. <br><br>Yup, I'm gonna close this thread too. We only need a few about the same topic, no matter how important it is. <br><br>But I did want to say that using the term 'nerf' for the bard drum bug is just wrong, and it kinda bugs me. It's a bug, plain and simple. A 'nerf', if you must use that term, is something that we've purposefully changed to be less effective. A bug is something that we broke and are going to fix.</UL>

Today's edition of the Absor Infobits contains information regarding the next patch and more:<ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047236.html"><b>Quick Overview of Next Patch </b></a><br>There are several fixes going in with the next patch. Due to the volume of requests for information regarding these topics, I thought it might be useful to mention them all at once in a separate thread. <br><br>/l will be changed to default to /loc <br><br>/loot will now work as it did before <br><br>The Trueshot discipline will be modified, it will be more effective (to exactly what degree we have yet to determine) <br><br>Drums will again add to the effect of bardic movement songs <br><br>&#8230; <br><br>Well, there are certainly other things, but those are the one&#8217;s off the top of my head. I just wanted to assure you that we are aware of these issues, and they will all be addressed with the next patch, which will occur next week.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047212.html"><b>What about all the PvP concerns? </b></a><br>Hi. <br><br>I&#8217;m really not here to post a long drawn-out response to everyone&#8217;s PvP concerns. And I don&#8217;t really want to start a thread asking for detailed lists of concerns yet. I&#8217;m only posting this to let you all know that I am not ignoring those concerns. I have a lot of research to do on it, though, since I don&#8217;t play PvP much at all. I do want to have a go at your questions, but I won&#8217;t be able to do so in the very near future. <br><br>But it won&#8217;t be that long off either.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047081.html"><b>Bugs and Issues</b></a><br>Ioti wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;1. Sneak/hide. Would it be possible to make this persist across zones? &#8230;&#8221;]</i></font><br><br>It might be possible. But, so far, there are some things that drop when you zone, such as hide and illusions. I&#8217;m not certain why this happens, whether it is gameplay related of just technology related. My guess is gameplay, but the reason for it I don&#8217;t know. I guess it seems odd, considering that invisibility stays with you when you zone&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;2. Can you make illusions not be dispelled after going LD? &#8230;&#8221;]</i></font><br><br>Possibly. But illusions are one of the type of spells that drops when you log out, and to make it stick when you go link dead, it would also have to stick when you log out. Like your last question, I don&#8217;t know why it does that.<br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;3. /loot is broken with the new /lootnodrop&#8230;&#8221;]</i></font><br><br>That should be fixed with the next patch. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;4. Can you make it so that when you tag yourself /afk, you go into a pseudo-ld mode and attack anything that jumps you?&#8230;&#8221;]</i></font><br><br>Nope. It just doesn&#8217;t seem to be a good idea to allow players to go into and out of artificial intelligence mode at will. My suggestion there is to find a safer place to go afk&#8230;<br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;5. &#8230;I camped out in the bank. I log back on to hear my bones cracking and Captain Orben attempting to gut me&#8230;&#8221;]</i></font><br><br>Bug. For some reason, in some cases your factions are appearing at their starting value when you first appear in zones. It&#8217;s rare, but we&#8217;re working on fixing it. I have no time line for the cure. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;6. The "group members not available" bug&#8230;&#8221;]</i></font><br><br>Isn&#8217;t this only a problem in some cases when the person fails to ungroup before logging out, or of course when going link dead? It&#8217;s certainly not a plague, but it is a bug. Again, I don&#8217;t know when we&#8217;ll get that fixed, but I&#8217;ll mention it to the team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047185.html"><b>Guild Purge Rumor</b></a><br>Airtreader wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;About 3-4 months ago they announced a "purge of the guild database" claiming that guilds with under 10 members was to much trouble for them. So after giving warning for over a month they prceeded to delete any guild on any server that did not at the instant the particular GM did a /w <guild> have 10 members ON-LINE. So lots of them that were very active, and had dozens and hundreds of memebers got stripped of their guild.&#8221;]</i></font> <br><br>I don&#8217;t like to come in here just to refute exaggerations, but this is getting silly, Airtreader. <br><br>Your description of the guild deletion process is completely false, and obviously intended to anger our customers and probably our employees as well. <br><br>The truth of the matter is that on the day we do the guild deletions (which are scheduled to occur monthly), we simply pull the data from the server to gather the total number of guild members (not just those that are online) and remove those guilds that do not meet the minimum membership requirements. <br><br>We have most certainly made errors during the early stages of this process. But we have it down pretty nicely now. And we have corrected the problems that happened early on. <br><br>Yes, it is still a requirement that all guilds have ten members &#8211; at all times. We still intend to remove guilds that do not meet that requirement on a monthly basis. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;Ah, being a jerk eh? Well, ok, then 90% of them&#8230;&#8221;]</i></font><br><br>That&#8217;s also a false statement, an exaggeration. <br><br>And, well, this thread seems to be more about attacking people than talking about game ideas. If someone wants to start a new thread about the guild membership requirements, or even about our mistakes in that matter, please do. But I&#8217;m just not willing to allow threads like this to continue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046869.html"><b>Trust and Dragging Corpses</b></a><br>Banzai wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;Also, while I'm on the topic the following command doesn't work the way it should: <br>/tell %t conent ]</i></font><br><br>That should, in theory, allow you to target a corpse and tell it's owner you want consent without typing the name.&#8221;< <br><br>Actually, what that should do, if I understand the way %t works, is: <br><br>/tell soandso&#8217;s _corpse Can I have consent to loot your corpse.
