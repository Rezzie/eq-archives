Shoji Tsunami informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Name_Of_Submitter: Shoji Tsunami<br>Event_name: Vox Slain by the Karana Council of Guilds<br>Email: xphlyboy@yahoo.com<br>Guild_Sponsoring_Event: Sacred Band Alliance<br>Date: 02/02/2001<br>Time: 07:30 PM CST<br>Event_Description: Last night, February 2nd, the combined forces of the Karana Council of Guilds under the leadership of Haemish MacClellan and the Sacred Band Alliance, invaded Permafrost Keep to slay the fair Lady Vox.  There were a number of interesting things that took place that made this raid so unique.<br><br>-	The last server split took most if not all of our talented raid leaders and strategists, so Haemish, a Barbarian Warrior, whom at the tender age of 39 Seasons, took up the mantle of leadership by organizing and leading this raid.<br><br>-	The final raiding parties consisted of 8 groups ranging in level from 52 at the high end all the way to our lone bard at 37(who was critical in keeping the forward group alive long enough for the nukers to kill Vox).  All in all, the average level was about 46.<br><br>-	The servers went down halfway through the raid &#8211; but we regrouped and cleared the castle again for a second push and then launched our attack.<br><br>-	We did this raid with only 2, yep count em, 2 !!!! clerics (a 51 Vicar and a 40 Cleric) and 1 Bard.<br><br>-	The raiding parties consisted of players from a collection of over 15+ small to medium sized guilds that all belong to the Karana Council of Guilds.<br><br><br>Lady Vox was very generous on this raid and dropped the following (sadly no FA books for the Paladins):<br><br>(2) McVaxius&#8217; Horns of War &#8211; One defaulted to Merithment 37 of Illuminatus, and the other was won by Edina Elvandar of Haven of Light<br><br>Crystalline Spear &#8211; Tanniss Riverwinds - 51 Champion of Forever Knights<br><br>Staff of Forbidden Rites &#8211; Drusila (DRU) of Kindred of the Moon<br><br>Warhammer of the Divine Grace &#8211; Azuriem Angelgrace &#8211; 40 Cleric and Leader of guild Illuminatus<br><br>Tobrin&#8217;s Mystic Eyepatch &#8211; Morgail D&#8217;unistar - 51 Wizard of Fell Omen<br><br>King room loot &#8211; Vox Bracers to Salani (47 Warrior) and Crystalline Sword to Cretar (51 Ranger).  With all the talk of Magic and Cold resists &#8211; you can imagine how hot and heavy the rolling was for the Vox Bracer <chuckle>.<br><br>We also managed to retrieve 2 Prickly Pears for the Shadowknight Lifeleech spell quest won by Silver Daggers and Fell Omen to be passed down to their respective ranking Shadowknights AND, 2 Blocks of Permafrost &#8211; marking the beginning of the epic quests for 2 more of Karana&#8217;s Warriors.<br><br><br>The KCoG would like to publicly thank Jzonn and Halagar on Ayonae Ro, Steelheart of Avenging Crusaders, Solonel, and Jannelle Alcedonia of Ashborne, and Pippi Langstrump of Silver Daggers all of whom provided the new management team with assistance in planning, strategy, and execution of the raid.  Your advice and guidance in advance of this raid was the lynchpin of our success.<br><br>The Karana Council of Guilds is a loose community of dozens of small to medium size guilds.  The KCoG sponsors a variety of player driven events ranging from player run &#8220;Battle-Chess&#8221; type chess tournaments in Butcher Block, to low level Tournaments all the way on up to Planes and Dragon raids.  For guilds that are not planes or dragon capable, the KCoG provides a fantastic opportunity for players of sufficient levels in those guilds to experience these large target encounters.

Brad McQuaid shed some more light on the changes coming to Donal's Breastplate in <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944.html">this thread he created</a> on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>I just read through Absor's post and the replies to it.<br>I wanted to clarify some things.<br><br>First, it didn't take 6 months and 300,000 people to find the problem. The problem was only made apparent recently, with Velious and the removal of the HP cap. The breastplate didn't appear as a problem until encounters started lasting much longer than they had previously. We made one attempt to address the issue, found out it wasn't nearly enough, and now are faced with having to do this change.<br><br>Removal of the HP cap added more variety to the game -- it changed strategies and tactics. No longer were we forced to simply make mobs kill in a very short period of time. Overall, this is a very good thing for the game -- variety and encounters that require differing tactics is good.<br><br>That said, whenever we do change or add behavior or other significant aspects of the game, other unforeseen problems often surface. It's the nature of the genre -- these game's change and evolve, and every change, small or large, can have unexpected ripple effects.<br><br>A second clarification: less than 5 or so mobs in Velious were created assuming the breastplate would be used, and this was mostly likely in error (i.e. we shouldn't have made that assumption in those cases). We will be addressing those mobs and tuning them down accordingly.<br><br>In summary, I'm sorry we goofed up -- it does happen. It will happen again. It's the nature of the beast, but we will always do our best to minimize these occurrences. And we will also do our best to react as fairly as possible when we are forced to act, attempting to do the right thing for both the individual player as well as the game as a whole.<br><br>It is unfortunate that the item was created in the first place, given its potential for problems, and it's also unfortunate that we didn't realize how much more magnified that problem would become when the HP cap was lifted. <br><br>That said, again, we're not perfect, and we will continue to make mistakes as long as this game continues to grow and evolve. And, no matter how dedicated our testing staff is, or how carefully we watch for problems on test, we will miss things that 300,000+ players will find. I don't see this changing, and I certainly don't think this is something unique to EQ, but rather something inherent to the genre -- no other type of game changes as often and as significantly, nor involves such a huge community of players who both work with and compete with each other.<br><br>I know that what I've said probably won't stop the flaming, and I know this is disappointing to both players who have the item as well as those who were planning on obtaining it one day -- I don't expect to post and have happiness follow -- but I did want to at least try to explain the situation in more detail, and to clarify it. And I also think it's important for us to try to manage expectations as they relate to the future.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

All CoG members and non-members are welcome to join.  Starting time is 2pm MST.  <br><br>All items acquired will be lotto'd off by need first, meaning class/race specific items will be lotto'd to those people first.  If no one needs the item, or already has one, it will be a free lotto for anyone who wants it.<br><br>Exp or exp loss, cash and items are not guarenteed on these hunts, though every effort will be taken to try to prevent exp loss and get some change in your pockets.<br><br>These hunts are formed to teach the basic principles of Plane/Dragon raids, and will be run as such.  Hunts like these are great ways to practice for the raids you will be able to attend at later levels.

Alan had a few parting words to share with us before leaving for Baltimore:<UL><LI><a href=""><b>Before Absor Leaves For Baltimore</b></a><br>I probably will have limited access to the Internet while I'm out of town. So I won't be posting much, if at all. And I won't be doing too much reading of the class threads either, sorry. <br><br>When I get back I'll be starting three threads (I think I'll be back on Monday&#8230;), Rogue, Paladin and Ranger Talk. I'm moving Rangers up because I want them all done by the end of the week. I will also be starting Necromancer and Magician talk threads later in the week. <br><br>Some time the week after I'll be posting my lists for each class. <br><br>I wanted to, once again, stress that the whole idea with all of this is to balance the classes, or get as close as we can. This might very well mean an increase in the strength of a class. But it might also mean a reduction in the strength of a class. We will consider 'nerfs' if they seem necessary. I am not suggesting that we are looking to nerf anything, but I also want you to be aware that we may do so. <br><br>So I'll see who I see in Baltimore. Have a good weekend.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745.html"><b>Bard Talk, Part 3</b></a><br>Draelon wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm not going to argue that this change is necessary, but it is one of convenience. I don't see how summoning 5 or 10 or 20 at a time would imbalance anything. It's not like food and drink have any effect on how fast you kill a mob. This creates extra down time, when it should reduce down time by making our trips into town fewer and further between.]</i></font> <br><br>And that makes perfect sense. I guess this is just one of those things that I sorta shrugged at, and I probably shouldn't have. I'll add it to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I don't mean to be confrontational, but I think the error is on your part. We don't want our haste to bring us in line with warrior damage. Look at it this way... ]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, then it was the way it was written that was an error. The quote pretty much says that he (or she) wanted the haste to bring him in line with a warrior for combat ability. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The stackable haste songs require an instrument to be played, eliminating the bard's ability to deal melee damage. In order for the Eravj songs to be useful in any capacity, they must recoup the loss of the bard's melee ability and then some, otherwise, it's more efficient for the bard to keep on using his weapons. <br>As it stands, adding an additional 5% haste to the entire party doesn't even come close to the damage that a bard can deal out if he continues to use his weapons, that's why we feel the percentage is too low.]</i></font> <br><br>All of this I understand. Though it could easily be argued that a 5% haste, in the right party, could provide more damage than the bard's blades. But the point is valid. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Our levle 39 charm song requires mana each time it pulses. This was implemented to limit the amount of charming a bard could do. Using Dirge drastically impacts our ability to charm. Furthermore, is 300 hp of damage so powerful that it warrants only being useable every 40-80 minutes?]</i></font> <br><br>No, it's probably no that powerful. I'm just leary of the suggestions that bards gain their mana back a lot faster, as that affects the charm song as well. Perhaps the better route is to look at the damage ratio or mana cost of the dirge. For safety sake, I'll add both to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lastly, you mentioned that you would be looking at the Lute of the Howler. Can you explain what about the lute makes it imbalancing? Bards (along with rogues) already recieve some illusions via items (mask of deception, mask of obtenbration, iksar hide mask) how do these differ from the lute's illusion?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, it isn't that different, not at all. Though I can see a greater objection to the werewolf form, for two reasons. It's not a player race, and it's the newest item to blurr that whole class distinction line. But you need to understand that my personal feeling that this item (heck all of them really) is a bit out of place does not mean that the team will agree with me. And even if they do, there's not a real high chance that anything would be done to the item. <br><br>NadiraAndante wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My personal issues about bards sortof parallel their previous work. Let me tell you, it IS annoying sitting in a group with an enchanter/shaman, and really having to wrack my brains to find effects from my repetoir that will enhance group effectiveness. Part of the problem is bard song stacking among other songs, but haste and slow stacking with similar spell effects would really help our groupability, and bards are absolutely supposed to be a group oriented class. <br><br>I don't see how helping our group reach the haste cap faster is unbalanceing. The game was played for a very long time at the haste cap and was still hard. Not all people have super haste items. Making them stack would increase our effectiveness while in a group, while not decreasing the effectiveness of the shaman/enchanter. Same with slows.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, it seems that the original design did consider this a balance issue. <br><br>I'll certainly add the whole haste and slow stacking this (I hope I mentioned this before, because it's been on the list&#8230;). I just don't know that you should expect a change. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Which brings me to my little tiff about our snare. We have to constantly recast this thing to make it work, its range isn't the greatest, and its resistance rate is pretty high...why does it also have no reliable effect time?? I know bards have to pay for no-mana effects, and believe me we DO pay for it our entire lives, but do we have to have every single disadvantage rolled up into one song?? When do the disads outweigh the ads?? Probably not in snare for a while, since it is the only effect of its kind we get from 23-51 so its <br>low range, high resistance, short effect time, AND unreliable effect time (best case is what 12 seconds?? Level 1 druid snare lasts how many times that??)]</i></font> <br><br>Well, it may have a much shorter duration than a druid snare, but you can also re-snare it, what, every 6 seconds? But I guess I can see that there may be too many restrictions on it. But keep in mind that this is not really intended to be a song that you can lock down something forever with. There has to be a pretty serious limitation on songs ('free' is always a dangerous thing when you are talking balance). <br><br>And, rather than quote more text, I understand your request for a raise in your secondary-type skills. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So, to balance bards you have to increase our level-effect caps on our songs, taking into account the raise in monster power between 50-60 when WE become 50-60 (since our level=song effect level augmented by instruments when possible) <br><br>And I would like to see our low-capped jack of all trades skills brought up to a level where they work at a fair level, like 2/3 or 1/2 the time of that skill's master expects success. <br><br>Plus significantly raiseing our defensive skills so that we're still below SK/Pally/ranger by a recognizeable ammount, just not a very large ammount.]</i></font> <br><br>Good, I like summaries. Makes my job a little easier. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: PSALMS of purity and vitality (29/37)...they're supposed to cure poison and disease eventually right?? They are STILL broken. I have never been able to cure someone with either of these songs, regardless of how many times myself or that other see the 'you've been cured' text. Try it in hate on the kirakui disease. I left the cure song on for about 10 minutes straight to no avail according to the afflicted paladin. Thats a lot of pulses yes?? And she DID say that she saw the cure message a great many times. It's been broken since release, they say it was fixed, but apparently that is not the case. Check it please.]</i></font> <br><br>Sure. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: And many of our songs have caster effects now, and its the new ones. Namely, the chants line 30/38/46, Nivs level 47, Shield of Song 49, Selos song of travel 51, and I believe our cantana at 55...casting effects with a lute or drum, can you pleeeeeease let me play my instrument like the bard I am instead of throwing it over my head and stretching!?!]</i></font> <br><br>I can look into that. As always, I have to give you the 'that's gonna be a low priority item' warning on these sorts of things.</UL>

Alan again hit the class threads hard today on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-3.html"><b>Monk Talk, Part 3</b></a><br>NyogTha wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This post was meant to show you that it is possible to twink and cheat this quest which I KNOW was not meant to be done via the Verant design team.]</i></font> <br><br>No worry, that's how I understood it too. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: SOLUTION: <br>Make all sashes/headbands NO DROP<br>Take the robe off of Brother Zephyl/Brother Qwinn<br>Do not allow for multi-questing either robe<br>Have Kaiaren hand the quester a container and have the the fang and Book of the Celestial Fists be combined and handed back into Kaiaren in order to receive the epic.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Though these ideas do have merit, they will, as you say, over power the class too much. Warriors get stun at 55 so why should we get it at 5?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, my thought was that at, say, 50th level, one of the skills you gain at 5th might get a new bonus, like stun or something. Same damage level, making it only really useful for it's special power. A way to give a monk a special skill without linking it to a higher level skill (making that skill too powerful), and giving it the limitation of much reduced damage. <br><br>This was only a thought, as I am not really convinced that monks really need any new skills. They have a pretty solid selection as it is. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: OK, the idea to fix Thunderkick is wonderful. It is easily taken care of with the use of a MINIMUM damage level. That is already on your list of things to address and we thank you. <br><br>STUN on T-Kick is a bad idea. We already get a discipline at 60 that allows us to stun called "Silent Fist". Please do not add this to T-Kick.]</i></font> <br><br>Got it. Obviously I haven't had time to familiarize myself with all of the skills that a monk gets. I was sorta relying on you guys to help me out there. Once I have these lists of ideas, though, I am going to give them all a reality check. I suspect that the stun on Thunderkick idea would have been tossed out when I got up to speed and discovered that it was an ability that monks already got at 60th level. Obviously it's possible to give a stun earlier, but probably not warranted. Thanks for the heads up. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This would probably be the best method of doing so. Please weigh both of these ideas.]</i></font> <br><br>We will. I think these might be the best two idea for raising monk damage a bit. But, again, let me clarify that I am not convinced this is needed. We'll have to decide if the class needs more damage post 50 before we even look at these. But I don't think either of these ideas is easier (linked special attacks and unlinking foot/hand attacks) than the other from a programming standpoint. I don't know for sure, but they sound like they might actually both be fairly easy to do (I can hear the programmers screaming now, I can see them lighting torches&#8230;) <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But giving us the ability to just "push back" the caster with our specials is EXACTLY what we need.]</i></font> <br><br>Fair enough. And maybe not with all of the attacks. Perhaps all past a certain level, or all kicks&#8230; something like that. A good idea, though, and easier to suggest than a stun. <br><br>Neou_the_Cyber_Monk wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think Absor leaves today to Baltimore so no more hearing from him anymore. ]</i></font> <br><br>Tomorrow morning, actually. So this will be the last you hear from me for a while.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-2.html"><b>Warrior Talk, Part 3</b></a><br>First, a few of my observations about warriors (you need to know this so that you can correct me where I'm wrong). As the 'base' class that other combat classes are built around, it should be very hard to find anything that is in need of change for the warrior. I'm reading things like more hit points&#8230; no. If we change warrior hit points, then we have to change all the other classes hit points, since the basis for hit points, at least on tanks, is the warrior&#8230; <br><br>I really don't expect to find too many things that need to be changed about warriors. <br><br>Also, I actually hope to see as many suggestions for 'nerfs' as for improvements. Keep in mind that the warrior is pretty much the base class, so it is very unlikely that we will be improving something that has any major effect unless it addresses some deficiency. If not, then this might actually be one of those cases where we need to do a sort of give and take. I guess I'm saying that by their very nature, warriors just about have to be balanced, and an improvement to them might necessarily require a change to all other fighting classes to match them. And that's not really what I'm looking for. <br><br>And, well, just like every other class, I want to warn you that a close examination like this brings the possibility that we will see something that needs to be nerfed. For example, I really don't like the idea that warriors have so many spells available to them through items, especially things like invisibility. I intend to ask that these things be looked at. My suspicion is that they won't be removed, we don't like to do that. But as a matter of class balance, I think it should be looked at. <br><br>My most powerful D&D character, by far, is a warrior. He's not powerful because he fights really well, though that's part of it. He's powerful because he has a lot of items that allow him to act like a caster. He isn't that high level, but he is more wanted in groups than my higher level characters. He's obnoxious, too, so it's not because of his personality&#8230; <br><br>Anyway, don't be too surprised if I don't pick a lot of suggestions from your lists. There might not be too much that needs changing. <br><br>Filo wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Another nice addition would be the addition of an "AE Taunt." In multi-MOB situations it would be nice if the warrior had a skill that would attract the attentions of more than one mob in the vicinity. Of course, this skill would have it's own drawbacks . . . be careful what you wish for.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, that's not such a bad idea. It has it's own drawbacks built right in. :)  I'm even willing to suggest a version of this that might allow the warrior to attack all creatures in the area (one swing). But it would have to be very high level and very limited in re-use. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Another area where Warriors seem to be a little lacking is in the AC and HP department. I am not suggesting that a huge move is needed in either of these areas, but in the high level game, there is precious little difference between a warriors AC and HP versus the hybrids and melee "wizards" (Rogues and Monks) ]</i></font> <br><br>That's exactly the opposite of what the hybrids, monks and rogues say&#8230; A lot of them think that there is too wide of a gap between their hit points and/or armor class and that of a warrior, and they want more. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is further compounded by the relative difficulty of the warrior epic as compared to the others. Why the double whammy?]</i></font> <br><br>I don't know&#8230; I really don't think that the warrior epic is relatively harder than most. It seems to be pretty middle of the road, to me. But I'll add it to the list (along with the request that we give it haste). <br><br>Aanya said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Other classes getting to close to warriors <br>I believe that warriors should be able to tank better than Paladins and Shadow Knights. I see that you "noted" those classes wishes for higher hp, better defensive skills, higher offansive skills etc etc. What they asked for, was for you to make their tanking ability close to the warriors. Our tanking ability vs most normal mobs is fine (except for taunt), but if you increase the tanking ability of the SK and Paladin, keep in mind that there would be no real reason to play a warrior at all. Why play a warrior without spells when you can play a warrior with spells.]</i></font> <br><br>We will keep that in mind. Remember, the warrior is the basis from which their skills and such are balanced. <br><br>evilsofa said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I've been watching the SK talk, and part of the problem there is that an improvement of the SK's defense (and, I'm sure, the Paladin's, when their talk begins) would be an intrusion on the Warrior's role as the ultimate defense. One way to give the SK and Paladin some wiggle room to improve their defense would be to improve the Warrior's defense in tandem.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, even if knights had exactly the same armor class and defensive skills as a warrior, they would be worse tanks, since they have noticeably fewer hit points. As I said earlier, improving warriors would almost by default mean an improvement in those other classes, so that the gap would not close. If we choose to close the gap, then warriors will have to remain where they are. I'm certainly not going to advocate an increase in warrior power _just_ so we can give more power to the hybrids. That seems sorta backward to me. <br><br>ErikTorvald wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BIND WOUNDS.... <br>Please allow the percentage healed to increase with level.

Tdir informed me of the following events:<BLOCKQUOTE>Lanys T'Vyl appeared in Rathe Mountains tonight, seeking one of her children to lead her to Oggok to find the evil shaman who gave her a flawed spell.  Trytiin led her there.  Once she made it to the city she was greeted by myself, Tdir, and other believes of the dark, to protect and escort the Lady of Hate.  We entered the town and explored, she looked for an ogre to lead her about the town.  We traveled in she pointed out various spots of good places to hold if Oggok was ever under attack. She also hinted to a plan of battle soon by either Firiona Vie and her followers or a possible civil war in the Tier'Dal.  She believes her King doesn't have trust and faith in her to win the war between good and hate.  So she told us true followers of hate to prepare for war.  She is waiting for the next move to be made then she will show herself again.  We heard the shaman running about in the town trying to get away.  He hid himself as a guard, that was a mistake.  She caught on and slayed the dumb ogre.   On our way to his known presense, the Daughter of Innoruuk attacked a Paladin who was attempting to kill one of the ogre guards.  He ran with his tail between his legs out of town.   Yet he came back and taunted her, she quickly summoned him and taught him a lesson.  She also decided that the Priest of Discord was a joke and quickly killed him aswell.

Just go ahead and increase the power of monks directly. If you want it rare, implement some interesting monk quests where they can have their intrinsic AC or dam/delay raised through a quest rather than a item, possibly getting those quest items off the same mobs with the same frequencies as monk item drops now.

I like the idea of making monks more reliant on their hands than on weapons, on their skills than on armor. You're right, it might be too late to make such a dramatic change.

If Dragon Punch/Tail Rake connects for damage, give a slightly lesser chance of doing an Eagle Strike.

(Call of Earth, enchanter haste spells, most bard songs, Speed of the Shissar, etc.) At least alter it so that even if the haste is not usable due to other, better buffs then the additional effects -- the extra +AC and +ATK -- will stack anyway, similar to the way the Robe of the Whistling Fists worked. It's pretty bad when a well-meaning ranger tosses me Call of Earth and costs me 54ATK and 12AC. The ranger buff especially does not make sense because Call of Earth is NOT a Haste Buff, and the Celestial Tranquility Effect will indeed stack with the upgrade, Strength of Earth.]</i></font> <br><br>That seems to make sense to me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7) At least consider spreading the weight limit increase out over the post-50 levels.<br>Few monks will make 55. Even fewer will make 60. Therefore, weight increases at those two points are not terribly useful. A 2lb increase every other level (i.e., 52, 54, 56, etc) would result in a weight limit of 24 at 60. A 1lb increase every post-50 level would be another way to implement the changes, and would also result in a weight limit of 24 at level 60. If these are "too much" of a weight increase (the current max weight limit at 60 is 22lbs, from four-pound increases at 55 and 60) then skip levels 55 and 60, when we get our passive enhancements of +1 HP per tick while feigned.]</i></font> <br><br>This also makes sense to me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Skill Caps.<br>Kick caps at 250. So why does Flying kick, eagle strike, and dragon punch all cap at 230?]</i></font> <br><br>I don't know&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Also, it was recently announced that they upped the caps for the Hand to Hand skill to equal 1hb/2hb, but all that was raised was the 60 cap, the 50 cap is still only 225 compared with 1hb/2hb cap of 240, so the 50 cap needs to be increased to 240 as well.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In addition, since kunark came out, people have noticed that feign is seen through more and more when the monk is down below 2 bubbles of health. This is a situation where the monk has successfully met the skill check (no "fallen" message), no spell was cast on the monk since they fd'ed, but the mob keeps pounding away. In the monk community this is refered often to as the "frenzy code". When a mob decides that they are going to kill you, they will kill you regardless. I personally have had times where I fd 8 or 9 times successfully in a row, but still have the mob continue to beat on me. Feign at above 2 bubbles of health, and this HARDLY happens. <br>So, at higher levels fd is useless as an escape tactic.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks, that's a useful explanation of the situation. I'll use it. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: a) revert the hole and sov so that mobs train back instead of walking back at the same time<br>b) increase the fd skill significatly (post 50 I should not be getting the "fallen" message as much as I do.<br>c) post 50, spells that hit us after we feign, or at least aoe spells) should NOT break feign. Yes we can take the damage, dot, etc..but it should not break the feign.<br>d) give us a short reuse disicipline that will clear our aggro 100%. Seem overpowering? not at all, we can already do this, its called /q. remember your downtime thread? having a monk /q to clear aggro is just silly. with /q and the mages coh, there is no reason not to have this.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm pretty sure that doing all of these things is just too much. But I can ask them to look at the situation. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Bug report: controls locked up upon standing from a fd. <br>Every once in a while when the monk stand from a feign death, they can only move forwards or backwards. not side to side.

Once the last robe is obtained, three groups can do all four of the battles needed to get the fists, and none of the mobs are rare spawns. In theory, you only need to camp two components - the pipes for the RotWF - the rest can be purchased or killed for.

I'm reading here how a people are telling us that, since it has been so long since this item was introduced, we should just leave it. Yes, we move slowly sometimes, nobody is denying that.

Look at it and try to understand how it would completely change the entire game, and not for the better. <br><br>I certainly understand your philosophy about only adding and never taking away. And it's the most pleasant route to take. But that route can only lead to disaster. If we never 'nerf' anything, then we have to spend every moment trying to push everything up to meet the standard of the best. If we make one tiny mistake and overpower one item, then we have to spend months (and I do mean months) boosting everything up to meet it. A few years from now we'd probably just have to start people a 50th level with planer gear so that they wouldn't be underpowered&#8230; <br><br>Sorry, as much as we would like to take the easy route, it's also the road to disaster. <br><br>Cattie_Luv said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I just don't see the point in nerfing an item 0.05% of the server population will actually posess and make use of it.]</i></font> <br><br>This is another sentiment that I don't understand. It seems, to me at least, self contradictory. You are saying that we shouldn't make this change because it only affects a very small number of players (which, by the way, I disagree with). But if it only affects 0.05% of the server population, than how can it be such a big deal that we change it? <br><br>Zariq wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is one (1) thing that stops it from being overpowered, rarity.]</i></font> <br><br>And that may be true. But the rarity of any item decreases over time in EverQuest. As time passes, more of the item enters the game, but rarely do any leave. With an item like this, probably none ever leave. So the rarity decreases with every passing day. Soon, the overpowering effect of an item like this pervades the game, and ruins it. <br><br>Celdor wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As a DM since the days when D&D was called Chainmail&#8482;, I can tell you that the worst thing a GM can do is feel offended that the players outsmarted you.]</i></font> <br><br>That's absolutely true. And if you think that we are making this change out of some sort of anger over being outsmarted, you are mistaken. I've explained several times how unbalancing this item is.

No matter the case, yes, we should have made a far more dramatic change earlier. We should have noticed the possible effect on the game a while ago. We didn't. I'm not, however, going to say that this should have been easy to see. Seeing that the item was broken is one thing (and we did, that's why the casting time was raised).

Also, for you Rogues reading, I'm moving you back to Tuesday next week, I won't be in the office on Monday. <br><br>Monks are one of those interesting types of warrior that, as a class, we have tried to balance a rather large volume of damage dealing with a lesser type of armor. It's not an easy task to build a fighting class that is 'balanced' with a warrior but doesn't wear armor&#8230; <br><br>So tell me what you think needs to be changed about monks. Keep in mind that I am primarily looking for balance issues, but give me whatever you've got. I am also not looking for suggestions that would dramatically change the class, or that would require an army of people to get into the game. I'm mostly looking for tweaks that would help to balance the class.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809.html"><b>Warrior Talk</b></a><br>What is there to say about warriors? <br><br>The idea of this thread is to talk about how to balance the warrior class in the game of EverQuest. I must admit that I don't really expect to see too many suggestions. The warrior seems to be a well balanced class. And we have to keep in mind that the warrior is a sort of staple class, upon which the relative balance of several other classes hinges directly. <br><br>So this is the forum to talk about what is right and what is wrong with warriors. Go ahead and tell me about bugs you've seen too. I'm not focusing on them, I'm concentrating on class balance here. But I will also take note of non-balance concerns as well. <br><br>Have at it, muscle-bound-types.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-2.html"><b>Enchanter Talk, Part 2</b></a><br>Here&#8217;s what I have as a sort of summary so far. Keep in mind that I wrote this yesterday evening (during Survivor&#8230;), so it does not take into account posts made after that. I am reading them today, though. <br><br>The first thing to think about is how enchanters work against the high-hit point creatures of Velious. Do they have enough to contribute over the course of a fight with such monsters? <br><br>I&#8217;m not sure that enchanters are in need of help in this area. Perhaps the addition of something like a DoT-pet would help. <br><br>Really, where the majority of higher level enchanters are expressing their concern is that there are too many creatures that are immune to mesmerization-type (and secondarily charm) spells. As I noted earlier, I&#8217;m not real sure that we can increase the functionality of those spells because they would simply over-balance the enchanter in those encounters (encounters where one or two very strong enemies are intended to challenge large groups, and one charm or mesmerization spell would eliminate all or half of the challenge). <br><br>I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ve seen an answer to this situation that will work. <br><br>Rampage: This line does not stack with other strength buffs. We should evaluate this, and decide if this is how it should be. <br><br>DoT Pet: Something not unlike the clerical hammer spell, to add more to the ability of the enchanter to help during fights with extremely high hit point enemies. <br><br>Illusions: Mostly, you want more illusions. There are also a few requests to add effects to some illusions. <br><br>Illusion, Wolf: There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf. If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors. I&#8217;ll have it on the list. I am very much against such homogenization of the classes. In fact, so much so that I don&#8217;t really think that enchanters should even be allowed to transform into wolves at all. <br><br>Illusion, Gender: Seems like a good request. <br><br>Illusion, Group Elemental (or race): A spell that grants the elemental illusions (or race) to the group. <br><br>Illusion, Change Size: Some sort of illusion that makes the caster bigger or smaller. This is something that I am against, assize change is really the area of the shaman. <br><br>Illusion Monster (and any copycat illusion): a spell that lets the enchanter copy the appearance of either a random monster in the zone, or a targeted creature. Faction issues will most certainly disallow this, but it&#8217;s listed. <br><br>Major Illusion: If possible, a high level spell (even 60th if needed) that has the functionality of the original minor illusion spells. One that brings back the enormous illusions that were possible with that spell. <br><br>Illusion face: Would give the enchanter a random face. <br><br>Illusion Races Bug: It seems that some illusions don&#8217;t resize the character properly to people that enter the zone after the illusion is cast. We should take a look for the giant gnomes and see if we can fix them. <br><br>Undead Illusions: I, frankly, feel that enchanters shouldn&#8217;t have these spells. I will ask that we look at them, and consider that they are the territory of the necromancer. <br>Phantom armor: It would be awesome to create an illusion spell that allowed the enchanter to look like he is wearing plate. Perhaps a new spell similar to the magician phantom line (perhaps just like it) that has this illusionary effect (and we should also think of adding this to the magician spells...)<br><br>Enchanting Items: I will add this to the list as a reminder. <br>Lull spells: These spells seem to be resisted too easily, more often used to pull than to break up a group. There should be at least a fair chance that the creature resisting this spell will not immediately aggro. <br><br>Bard Lute: We should at least look at this loot. Even if we don&#8217;t remove it (it is a very rare item), we should keep it in mind when making new items. It gives a key enchanter ability to another class. <br><br>Voice Graft: We should evaluate the idea of giving this spell to all pet classes, including enchanters. <br><br>Whirl til you hurl and Dyn's Dizzying Draught: Players feel that these spells are too easily resisted and too easily broken. <br><br>Mesmerization spells: There are some targets that are unaffected by these spells, either due to level or race. Our anti-undead spell lines give the character back a message when he tries to cast on an invalid target, and the spells don&#8217;t even cast (costing the caster no mana). We should consider this approach for mez spells as well. <br><br>Mesmerization spells and overwriting: Are single target mez spells supposed to overwrite area of effect mez spells? It seems that perhaps they should. Minimally, higher level mez spells should overwrite lower level mez spells. <br><br>Mesmerization (Charm) Indicator: I, personally, don&#8217;t really like this idea. But there is a call for a change of the color of a monster&#8217;s name when it is under the effects of mez and charm so that people know by looking. <br><br>Low level Evocation practice spell: Enchanters don&#8217;t seem to have a spell like Flare with which they can practice their evocation skills early on. <br><br>Tiny Daggers: These items are unavailable in Qeynos. This needs to be fixed <br><br>Pet Positioning: Because enchanters can&#8217;t tell there pets where to go, they often get in the way. There is a tendency with all pets to stand right in front of their master. This is a bit of a pain when the caster is trying to target something, or just trying to see something. Can we have pets (all pets) default to standing behind their master? <br><br>'Charm wears off': players report that this message is sometimes sent long after the charm has worn off, after the creature is dead sometimes. <br><br>Reoccurring Amnesia: The reports are pretty overwhelming, this spell does not reoccur. <br><br>Boon of the Clear Mind: This is a group clarity spell, and should probably overwrite Clarity, and it does not. Either spell should probably overwrite the other, basically just increasing the duration (and the same should apply to the clarity 2 spells). It also seems that this spell has a very short useful life span. Lowering the level of this spell would allow its use for longer before they get Clarity 2. <br><br>Failure Messages: Some spells (Lull series and stuns against giants are primary examples) give the same message on failure that they do on success. If it fails it probably should say so. <br><br>Mask Faith: Players have been asking for the ability to mask their religion for a while. I think this is a bad idea. But I have a logical argument in favor of it, so I&#8217;m presenting it. I like the idea of characters having to deal with their religious choice, even enchanters. But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic. That's something that I don't like at all. The solution to the problem here (the problem being that there are now very few enchanters that are not agnostic) might be moving their spells so they don&#8217;t have to enter dangerous cities (which they can&#8217;t get into if they have a religion), or making religion more valuable. <br><br>Cantana (a bard song) and Clarity: I was under the impression that clarity spells would stack with bard mana regeneration songs. There might be something wrong with the stacking of these two spells. It seems that the bard song will stack over the enchanter spell, but the song must be stopped or the enchanter spell won&#8217;t take. <br><br>Blanket of Forgetfulness: Is this spell supposed to be more effective than it is? <br><br>Collaboration: This spell does not seem to have any affect in Skyfire, but it does in Kael Drakkal. Is this a bug? <br><br>Illusions and Link Death: Can we make it so that Illusions remain up during a link death (not during zoning, though). <br><br>The Essential Enchanter: We should look into why an enchanter is considered &#8216;essential&#8217; in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that. <br><br>Resplendent Robe: The effect is Rune IV, but it requires a component? That seems wrong. <br><br>Rune IV: The cost of the gem used to cast this spell might be too high. <br><br>Boon of the Garou: We should probably up the duration by thirty seconds or something, so that the spell can be kept up on two targets without it dropping (the duration is currently exactly twice the recast time). <br><br>Tash Line: The thought from the players is that this line causes too much aggro. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that way for balance or if it is perhaps an exaggeration. We should look at this. <br><br>Recast Bug on fast spells: After casting a spell, sometimes attempts to cast fast casting spells (Tash line, for example) will not cast right away, and will give a "this spell is not ready message".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857.html"><b>Donal's Breastplate to be Nerfed</b></a><br>We've changed this item before because we thought it was overpowered. Unfortunately, it is still overpowered. Let me explain why. <br><br>This item is a breastplate that is only usable by clerics. If you right click this item, it will cast a Complete Heal on your target with a casting time of 30 seconds. It uses no mana to produce this effect. <br><br>A group of two characters, one cleric wearing this breastplate and one warrior, can defeat any opponent, as long as that opponent can not kill the warrior in under 30 seconds. <br><br>Let me restate that. <br><br>One cleric and one warrior, using this one magic item, can defeat ANY opponent or any number of opponents that are not capable of killing the warrior in under 30 seconds. <br><br>I hope that the impact that this game dynamic has on the game is obvious to everyone. If we allow this item to remain in the game as it is, we will have to change the game so that monsters are capable of killing a warrior in 30 seconds. 15 seconds if the group consists of two clerics with this breastplate and one warrior, and it gets worse from there... <br><br>Of course, if we make the world so hard that this breastplate is not overwhelmingly powerful, we would have to, essentially, rebuild the game, rebalance the classes&#8230; No single item should be so powerful that the balance of the game revolves around it. Adjusting the game to fit this item is not a choice. We need to change the item to fit the game. <br><br>We have had a fair amount of internal debate over this item. It really comes down to two choices. Eliminate the item entirely, or change the way it works. We would rather change the way it works. After much debate and some conversations with players that have characters that use this item, we decided on the following change. <br><br>The item will cast a new spell (to be named later). The effect of this spell will be to completely heal the target. The spell will also leave a buff on the recipient that lasts somewhere between five and ten minutes (we are leaning toward a compromise of 7.5 minutes). This buff will have some small positive effect (perhaps a 1 point regenerative effect), but as long as this buff is on a character, he can not receive the effect of this spell again. This buff will not be removable until its duration runs out. <br><br>In practice, what this will mean is that the cleric with a Donal's Breastplate will be able to heal anyone he wants every 30 seconds. But he will not be able to heal the same person twice unless 7.5 minutes has passed between healings. The breastplate will still almost completely eliminate downtime due to hit point loss, and it will no longer destroy the game dynamic of EverQuest. <br><br>There is one concern that we have as to this implementation, and I'd like your feedback on it. <br><br>There are some cases where a character would have all of his buff slots full and be unable to gain a new buff. This new Donal's effect would be, essentially, a buff. We can either have it overwrite a current buff, or have the spell fail if the character has a full load of buffs on him. I can see arguments for either implementation, and I want to hear your thoughts on it. <br><br>Yes, we know this is a 'nerf'. And, frankly, we're willing to nerf this item to save the game as a whole. We are sorry about ever creating an item that is so easily unbalancing to the game, and we're sorry that we have to change it again. For now, I can't tell you when this change will take place. It won't be until after we've finished the work that has us on hold for updating the game. When I have a better timeframe, I'll certainly let you all know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052728.html"><b>On Shadow Kights</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: From shadowknights being labelled a 'defensive' class when we see ourselves as 'offensive', to this latest blunder with the spells and what levels we gain them&#8230;]</i></font> <br><br>Well, actually, that was not a 'blunder'. It was a random pair of numbers that I made up by way of example. Not the use of the word 'if' in the original statement. <br><br>As for the perception that shadow knights are offensive or defensive&#8230; well, I think I can make a far better case for them being considered a defensive class than on offensive one, based solely on their skill caps. They are a defensive warrior with offensive spell ability. A paladin is a defensive warrior with defensive spell ability.<br> <br>And, yes, it may very well be the case that the double penalty of later and more expensive spells is wrong. That's why it's on my list of things to evaluate...</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Neverly's latest editorial entitled <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid980733951,70320,">2cp For a SoW? Anyone?</a> has been published to our Editorial section.  Here's a clip:<UL>Now, unbeknownst to me, there had been a commentary running for some minutes before my entrance. It concerned, predictably enough, the stupidity of &#8220;newbies&#8221;, and was voiced by two 25th level characters: one druid and one warrior. The druid had been approached by a young halfling in the same situation as my own &#8211; he needed a SoW (Spirit of the Wolf) to retrieve his corpse. His request, though quite common, was answered with a string of insults, digs, and shouts of &#8220;LOL!!!&#8221; that filled many a passerby&#8217;s chat window to overflowing. Walking in at the end of this, I just caught the druid&#8217;s concluding statements as he voiced interest in having all newbies systematically destroyed by a wayward &#8220;bug&#8221;. Being largely unaware of the situation at that point (I was filled in later by a compliant wood elf), I ignored the harsh words and within moments had sent a tell politely requesting an SoW from the druid in question. Needless to say, the response I received was less than flattering. However, after a bit of verbal dueling and some liberal use of my stress ball, I managed to wrestle a response that wasn&#8217;t awash in abbreviated giggling, which I now quote:<br><br>&#8220;SoW is my main source of income, so, if you can&#8217;t pay, don&#8217;t ask.&#8221;<br><br>His main source of income, he says. I read that line with eyebrows raised, unbelieving. Could it be true? Could this man have such a long line of impatient customers that to spare a bit manna and some time for a 7th level cleric severely crimped his financial plans? Of course not, he was simply being nasty. Realizing this, I complemented him on his dedication to character, remarking that there has to be some greedy scumbags in the world. I then left, sans a SoW, and made my way towards Halas once again, tottering along and finding my mind occupied by the entire idea of charging for spells.* </UL>Enjoy!
