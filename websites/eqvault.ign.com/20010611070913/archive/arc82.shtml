As the online persistent world category continues to grow and evolve, one of the most exciting aspects to watch is the way each new project reveals different design ideas and influences.  For this reason, it can be pretty difficult knowing that a potentially exciting project is in progress, but still waiting patiently until its developer is ready to unveil it.  A bit earlier today, Wombat Games formally announced Dark Zion, a game we&#8217;ve been waiting to learn about for some time, and one that seems certain to attract considerable interest from the online gaming community.  <br><br>At a time when game makers with experience creating online worlds are at a premium, Wombat&#8217;s co-founders include Rick Delaschmit, former Lead Programmer of Ultima Online, and Jason Spangler who held the same position on the Ultima Online: The Second Age expansion.  In addition, the team&#8217;s Creative Consultant is the internationally acclaimed New York Times best-selling author Tad Williams.  <br><br>To bring the online gaming community the best possible coverage of this exciting new title, the IGN Vault Network announces the opening of our latest dedicated site, <a href="http://dzvault.ign.com/">Dark Zion Vault</a>.  And as the highlight of our launch, we are pleased to present the first-ever exclusive and very extensive interview with the game&#8217;s principals at Wombat Games.  Here&#8217;s a brief summary of the game to pique your interest: <blockquote> Dark Zion is a player-driven, player-controlled persistent online world.  Players will have an unprecedented level of control over their environment; beyond building a character, a player will have the opportunity to build a business, a town, an army, even an entire society.  There will be no arbitrary quests or super-imposed events; the story is the success or failure of the world at large. </blockquote> Other features at Dark Zion Vault will include game information, news, concept art, screenshots, humor, reader and community participation features, humor and much more.  New features and content will begin to appear in the very near future.<br><br>We invite all members of the community who are interested in the future of online gaming to stop in and check out the coming excitement from Wombat Games and best-selling author Tad Williams at our brand new Dark Zion Vault.  Enjoy!

Mandos  of the <a href="http://www.loreseekers.com/">Lore Seekers</a> sent a very intriguing report detailing information about mysterious teleporters that will deliever a player to one of Norrath's major cities.  Here is the report, you'll need to highlight it with your mouse cursor to view it as some might consider this a spoiler:<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="white"><i>Honorable Guildmaster Sorontar:<br><br>As a Wizard, I am professionally interested in all things having to do<br>with ethereal transport.  As such, I was drawn to rumors concerning<br>firepots throughout the lands of Norrath.  These rumors spoke of an<br>ancient transport system "for those of evil race", which could be<br>accessed through having the appropriate "key", and inserting it (or<br>using it) with the appropriate "firepot" in a Norrathian city, to be<br>instantly transported to another city of Norrath, without the need of<br>spell, Wizard or Druid (shudder!).<br><br>Knowing that most ancient magic was not related to the evils that plague<br>Norrath, I have long discounted the likelihood that such devices, if<br>they existed, were for evil races' exclusive use.  Evil races are prone<br>to destruction, rarely creativity of any sort!  However, it has come to<br>my attention, that such teleportation devices do, in fact exist, and can<br>be utilized by all races.  However, their utility is, at this stage of<br>my investigation, limited to travel from one hub point to twelve (12) of<br>the cities of Norrath.<br><br>This hub point is deep under the Timorous Deep, located at -12260,<br>+4365, -277.  It came to my attention, that the top of a classic Combine<br>Era Wizard Spire, with its familiar four tines, was observable above the<br>waves in this depth of Ocean.  If you swim down directly between the<br>four tines, you will find a square opening on the ocean floor.<br>Descending, you will find yourself suddenly in air, in a square room,<br>with three firepots along each wall.  In the center burns a magic fire<br>of blue, such as can be seen at certain ancient Elvish and Combine<br>towers (e.g. Oasis).  Note that the descent from the surface is one way,<br>and I was unable to find any way to leave the room by normal means.  No<br>monster nor person disturbed my researches that followed.<br><br>Binding myself to the locale, I commenced to mediate on the twelve<br>firepots. It was immediately apparent that the style of each was<br>different, and each was familiar to a particular culture of Norrath.  I<br>proceeded to test my hypothesis, and touching the rust-colored low<br>firepot, similar to many in the city of my youth, found myself, being<br>dusted off by a very surprised guard (my second cousin, twice removed),<br>in Northern Felwithe.  Without answering my startled cousin's queries<br>(he knows I tend to gate around hastily...), I immediately gated back.<br>I tested all twelve pots, and here is the key of their wisdom:<br><br>North Left:(fire on floor)Grobb (entrance)<br>North Center:(6 side gray)Ogguk  (entrance)<br>North Right:(6 side tall)Erudin (near dock)<br><br>East Left:(6 side gray)Neriak Commons (entrance)<br>East Center:(4 side wood)Greater Faydark (under Kelethin)<br>East Right:(6 side rust)Northern Felwithe (entrance)<br><br>South Left:(Brown box)Halas(near dock)<br>South Center:(Dark with blue)East Freeport (on dock)<br>South Right:(tall gold vase)Cabilis West (entrance)<br><br>West Left:(White marble)South Kaladim (entrance)<br>West Center:(Lava Lamp)Akannon (entrance)<br>West Right:(torch stand)Rivervale (entrance)<br><br>It is to be noted that "the Black Hole", Qeynos, and Highpass, are not<br>represented here.<br><br>An intriguing question, beyond the origin of these firepots and their<br>creator's identity, is: "Are there other pots out there that bring you<br>to The Timorous Deep?"<br><br>Respectfully submitted,<br><br>Mandos Turambar, Wizard Peregrinator of the 48th Degree<br>Treasurer of the First Chapterhouse of the Seekers of Lore (Tarew Marr)</i></font></BLOCKQUOTE>This is a very interesting addition to the world of Norrath.

Gordon Wrinn just posted the following post on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>There's a couple of issues that have several threads running behind them. It might be easier for me to address them at one time:<br>Spirit of Scale:<br><br>We'll be making this spell group-only (e.g. must be grouped with target) shortly. This should alleviate people's concerns about it being used offensivly to harm other players.<br><br>Backstabbing Pets:<br><br>Up until the level 50+ pet spells, all pets were based off of warriors. We now have the ability to base pets off of other classes, and that's what's been done here. There are now rogue pets, wizard pets, and monk pets, which represent additional abilities for the pet-users above 50th level.<br><br>Rogues need not worry that a backstabbing pet somehow reduces the desirability of their class. First, the pet does not have the backstab skill that a rogue of that level would have, so they won't hit as often nor will they do as much damage. Furthermore, they don't have all of the stat bonuses that increase the rogues effectiveness. Certainly they can be buffed up, but they'll never come close to having a real rogue. Finally, rogue pets will never have the ability to double-backstab as rogues do.<br><br>Rogue pets won't be picking locks either, and there are quite a few places to do that in Kunark.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn was posting up a storm on the Gameplay Board.  Here's quotes and excerpts from his latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035607.html"><b>Questions about Disciplines</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1) why are most of the durations 9-18 seconds? ]</i><P>Disciplines without a downside have a short duration for balance reasons. Some of the warrior disciplines have upsides and downsides, and thus have a longer duration <P>Most of the short duration disciplins allow you to do something dramatic that drastically increases your effectiveness. The short period of time is necessary for balance. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 2) since the durations are so short why are the refresh times so long? ]</i><P>Balance again. Some of them are so powerful that we don't want them available constantly. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 3) why are all the disciplines on the same refresh timer? ]</i><P>See balance :)  Bascially /discipline is one ability, though there are different types of disciplines available. We basically didn't want a discipline to *always* be available.<P> <i>[Quote from original post: what range is the reduction in refresh time as a player advances in levels? 1%/level 5%/level 10%/level? ]</i><P>Generally 1 minute per level. <P><i>[Quote from original post: I'm just looking for some general answers. Originally I thought disciplines would be extremely powerful...but if a monk who uses Ashenhand can't use another discipline for 72 minutes...or a warrior who uses Mighty Blow can't use another for 60 minutes...UGH! Just would like to know why. ]</i><P>Though they aren't equivalent to LoH or Harm Touch, these are two very powerful disciplines that can be used for one encounter. Please remember that warriors, rogues, and monks are considered essentially well-balanced without these disciplines, and as such they are something extra. We have to be careful when giving extra abilities to insure that they don't "overpower" the class. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035598.html"><b>Why are are Enchanters 'Forced' to Solo to Level 29?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: why am i forced to solo to 29? yes you put in breeze but it is still useless]</i><P> Your argument appears to be based upon the assertion that Clarity is the only thing that makes an enchanter a worthwhile group member. In our opinion, this is certainly not the case. <P><i>[Quote from original post: so i cant get the spell. unless i want to pay 60p for a level 16 spell? ]</i><P>The spell just became obtainable yesterday. I'm sure the price will drop once supply catches up with demand. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035581.html"><b>Veeshan's Peak</b></a><br>Considering Veeshan's Peak, I'd like to explain something about this zone: It is designed to be the most difficult zone in the game, even more so than the Planes. As such, its rewards are much higher than other zones, but so are the risks.<P> We recommend that only the most advanced and organized players in the game even attempt to enter this zone. The customer service staff (GMs and Guides) will not assist players in any way in regards to this zone. This includes help for issues such as unrecoverable corpses (see your local Necromancer), or characters finding themselves stuck (see your local Magician), bugs, etc. The only assistance that will be offered by customer service reps in this zone are those covered by the Play Nice Policies. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035367-2.html"><b>Warrior HP at level 51</b></a><br>Number of hitpoints gained per level is assigned on the basis of race, class, and a multiplier based upon level. The multiplier increases in steps every X (where X is a value based upon race and class) levels. When someone hits a level where the value of X is increased above that of the previous level, the character will experience a HP "pop" over that that they usually receive. This in essence "makes up" for all the extra hitpoints they would have received if the multiplier was that way all along. <P>The Palys, SKs, and Bards all hit a step of that sort at 51, causing some of them to get upwards of 100 HP for the level. This doesn't mean that they are getting 100HP per level, just that for that level the number of hitpoints received "made up" for the hitpoints they would have gotten if the multiplier had always been at that level. <P>Warriors operate on a different schedule than SKs and Palys, but the curve will always favor them. For instance, warriors should see a fairly substantial hitpoint pop when they hit 54. <P>It's important to remember that 51 to 60 is not considered a "new" game. What I mean by this is that algorithms that take level into account and improve something every Y levels don't start over at 50+, they continue from where they left off. For instance, if someone has an attribute that improves in effectiveness every 4 levels, and his last improvement was at level 48, he won't see the next one until 52. This might make it appear that someone else who gets an improvement every 10 levels, and got their last improvement at 41, and gets their next one at 51 somehow gets something before the first guy. It's not the case, it's just the way that the math works. <P>I hope I haven't confused the issue further :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035591.html"><b>Hybrids in the Expansion</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Hybrids are what 60 percent warrior 40 percent druid,cleric, or necro? Yet all we get in expansion is spells that have been in the game for a while???]</i><P> You also get enhanced damage tables, higher skill caps, higher hitpoint multipliers, etc. But it is true that the only spells you get will be those of your parent class, and this has been a pillar of the class since the game was release with exception of the 49th level quest spells. <P>At 60th level, the Palys, rangers, and SKs, will all *melee* better than a 50th level warrior. You of course won't melee as well as a 60th level warrior, but that remains as designed. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035599.html"><b>Taunt Skill Issues</b></a><br>The skill level associated with taunt interacts with your level to determine how likely the taunt is to be successful. It does not control the level of success. A successful taunt will *always* make the creature shift to you, assuming that it can be taunted (Yes, some creatures are untauntable). <P>Taunt makes a creature hate you just a little bit more than it hates the next guy on the list. In other words, multiple successful taunts, or taunting a creature that is already attacking you doesn't do anything extra. <P>I hope that clears up how Taunt works.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035610.html"><b>Skill Cap Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: All of the new skill caps are still under what is acheivable by a level 50 character. So my question is do you need to buy Kunark in order to have higher skill caps?]</i><P> Skill cap changes are associated with level, and only affect the 50+ game. In other words, a warrior who maxes a skill out at 40 won't have a chance to raise it more until level 51. So, yes, you need to buy Kunark (and level above 50) to get an increase in your skill caps.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035645.html"><b>Wolf Form is KOS to Druids in Fironia Vie</b></a><br>The city governments have been enacting leash laws lately to try and curb the number of strays running wild through the cities. Wolves that aren't on leashes (e.g. a pet) will be attacked and killed on site by many of the guards. <P>That&#8217;s an RP reason anyway and I thought some might get a kick out of it :)<P>OOC: <P>Most NPCs were viewing a druid in wolf-form as a BetaNeutral NPC, instead of as a wolf. This was fixed a few weeks ago in many of the cities, and should have been in the patch message.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035641.html"><b>Pronouncing Kunark</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I-K-S-A-R (ick-sar) ]</i><P>On another note, just so everyone knows, Iksar is both singular and plural. For example: <P>The troll slaughtered a human.<br>The troll slaughtered 5 humans.<br>The troll was slaughtered by an Iksar.<br>The troll was slaughtered by 5 Iksar, but they really only needed one :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035312.html"><b>In Response to Recent Shipping Comment</b></a> (see below)<br><i>[Quote from original post: How far would that be Abashi?? Sent to Zomax? Already packaged and waiting on the Zomax shipping docks?]</i><P> "Too far" is "In Zomax&#8217;s queue for shipping today" as I understand it. Sorry for the confusion. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035217.html"><b>Range Attack Bug</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: With the creation of the new buttons on the Combat menu Splitting up Melee Attack into Melee 1 and Melee 2, and moving Range Attack to the next row, my Range Attack has disappeared.]</i><P>This is an art bug that was apparently introduced in the past day or so under the combat-skills menu. The buttons still function appropriately, its just that the names are being displayed improperly. The fix for this shouldn't take long.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035212.html"><b>The Scale Spells</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: From this day forth, anyone asking me for a SOW that I am not grouped with shall receive Tunare&#8217;s blessing of Scale Of Wolf. I strongly encourage all Druids and Shamans to follow my example until Tunare (a.k.a GZ) decides to fix this spell. <P>-Wolfen / 50 Druid - Druzzil Ro]</i><P>I think that this might be a good time to mention that the "Scale" spells are not upgrades to spirit of wolf. They are a spell of a different line that happens to have the same effect. The purpose of these spells is to allow faster travel in the huge Kunark zones. It is not meant to be the offensive spell that SoW has become.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/034588-5.html"><b>Why Isn't Karana Being Split?</b></a><br>Karana wasn't in the top four at time that decided what servers were to be split. I wish the situation was more complicated than that, but that's really all there is to it. Of the top 8 or so servers, most of them are hitting within 100 of each other at peak. It's not a large margin, but Karana (and the other servers that people have lodged complaints about) missed out by a few people. The cut off had to be placed somewhere, and I'm sorry that it couldn't please everyone.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035065.html"><b>An Age-restricted Server</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I think a server of 30-year old plus limits should be created. I know this is stereotyping the younger generation as a bunch of adolescent goofballs, but the majority of people that drive me crazy are under 20 years old. ]</i><P>It is very important to remember that age does not necessarily equal maturity, nor does it have anything to do with how people will act in an environment with a relatively high perception of anonymity. We hold everyone, regardless of age, up to the same standards of conduct in game. Though I do certainly sympathize with your desire to be free of those who are anti-social, that aspect of society will always exist in the massively multiplayer world regardless of the restrictions that we place on age.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035196.html"><b>No Kunark Image</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone else try to create an Iskar charcter and not have it appear on the list as an active character ( no portrait). I installed the cd and nothing seemed to go wrong. Allowed the patches and can't find any reason why the character, which allows me to go through the creation process, does not appear.]</i><P> Did you remember to press the "Kunark Registration" button in the chat server and enter your new account key? Until you do that, you are not flagged as able to access Kunark content. Even people who haven't registered yet have the ability to see the Iksar in the character selection screen and can attempt to create one. We'll probably have a poppup box to suggest that people buy the expansion if they wish to do this put in soon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/034184.html"><b>Cancelling RoK Orders</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: According to FTC law Verant must supply a method for me to do this. Where is it? I have sent numerous emails all with no response. <P>My credit card has been billed for 80 dollars. Canadian. Don't mind the game being a little late but when I am billed for next day shipping I expect to get it. Especially when that charge is a $21USD difference. Sorry refunding one months play time (less then $9.95USD I subscribe to the 3 month at a time plan)doesn't make up for a $21USD overcharge.]</i><P> The cancellation option is for you to call Station customer service at 1-888-STATION. They have the ability to cancel assuming that the order hasn't gone too far in the system. <br>--<br>Those who wish to cancel their orders may do so by calling the Station (1-888-STATION). If the order hasn't gone too far through the system and shipping can be stopped, we will. <P>Again, we apologize for the shipping problems with the product and remind everyone that we've set up the kunarkrefund@verant.com email address to process shipping-cost refunds as well as credit those who meet the criteria specified in the patch message with a free month of EverQuest. </UL>

A player-written first impressions of Kunark was published a few minutes ago to our <a href="/lore/editorials">Editorial</a> section titled the <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid956694055,89604,">Pros and Cons of Kunark</a>.  Here's a snippet from this article:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>The partial reason for these horrid framerates is the trees. Yes, the trees. I know its nice and realistic that the trees sway in the wind, but as soon as you get more than 6 or 8 trees on screen at once, be prepared for slowdown. This is even worse in the Warsliks Woods and the Burning Woods where there are trees EVERYWHERE as far as the eye can see. The leaf covered branches are low to the ground so you can't see 10 feet in front of you. While this is good because it creates a real sense of danger, it is too much when you have 15 trees all intersecting each other and all swaying, all around you. If they include a switch to turn off the swaying trees then I think this would help greatly. In fact let my put it in bold for those of you who are just skimping through. INCLUDE A SWITCH TO TURN OFF THE SWAYING OF THE TREES. Needles to say, navigating the woods is not desirable at 15 fps as there are countless moving objects obstructing your view.</i></BLOCKQUOTE>Feel free to post your comments about this article.

Lordstyle sent me some interesting information about his call to Zomax this morning.  Here's his letter:<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, I just got off the phone with Zomax this morning, at 8:35am PST, and I found out <br>something interesting about the trouble that was being caused with the shipping.<br> <br>First, I would like to say that when I called, I was helped by a very friendly lady, who not only <br>found my order but even told me that it had been shipped and was due to arrive today.<br> <br>The problem that Zomax had, which seems to be confirmed by more then one person at Zomax, <br>is that they ended up with corrupt files and had to fill each persons order by hand, since the <br>computer that normally handled it had corrupt files. Thus, the long long delay in people getting <br>their game. As she explained it, having to fill out the order papers manually slowed the shipping <br>down a great deal. So I would tell all users out there to please hold on, they should be getting <br>them in the next day or two.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

A controversial new article taking a look at the mind of an established PKer has been published to the <a href="/lore/editorials">Editorial section</a> and is titled <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid956693949,9249,">Smashing the Stereotype</a>.  Here's an excerpt from this article written by Chialde Tal'Dranneth:<UL><i>I have always been a PK, in every game I have ever played. I have never played an "anti PK" or played by any other gaming philosophy.<br>Many of my "crimes against humanity", mostly perpetrated in Ultima<br>Online, have been documented on the Internet (do a search for "WarChild of KoT" if you are interested). Most of these published experiences, although resulting in the other player's death, have been positive for all parties involved. </i></UL>As always, feel free to post your comments about this article.

Myrlynn sends word of a GM event on Solusek Ro:<BLOCKQUOTE>"Calling out to the power that be on Solusek Ro. Come forth with you <br>mighty guilds and compete for the destruction of Qeynos!" was broadcast <br>by Lady Daegarmo.<br><br>Quickly, and efficiently, the power of Paradigm raced to the fair city <br>of Qeynos to stake forth their claim as the most honorable Guild of <br>Norrath. Khengus Myrlynn, the esteemed Tracker stood first in the <br>majesty of Lady Daegarmo.<br><br>Five guilds arrived to do battle with the foul forces of North Qeynos <br>with only one be able to be crowned champion and be given their shot at <br>destroying all of South Qeynos. <br><br>The evil minions of North Qeynos were soon set upon by the forces of <br>Paradigm and their opponents. Led by the hoots and hollers of <br>Paradigm, Drakarr the Ungodly began to draw the lifeforce from the fould <br>citezens we were to slay. Behind him, the Heavenly powers of the <br>Priestess Tannis wrought the famed healing powers to keep them all <br>going. Pure Magiks were released upon our foes from the glittering <br>hands of Sorasil the Merciless as the harmonies ripped power throw the <br>lyranthe of the famed Aanani. Not to be outdone, Tallyn Masterougue <br>instilled terrors in the eyes of the enemy and unmercifully backstabbed <br>them with a laugh and an evil grin.<br><br>As North Qeynos was slowly brought to its knees, the Fiery Vengeance of <br>Paradigms Guildmaster Steiner Ewokbane brought down target after foul <br>target. Energizing the powers that be, swiftness and toughness were <br>dealt out by the members from the side. Excelander, Narg, Etal, Danmir, <br>Gukak and Keryl were there to make our fine attackers stronger and more <br>powerful. <br><br>Joining the Priestess in bringing forth energies from their gods, <br>Evldor, Skoal, Sarion and Dulfar brought glory to our name. Hurling <br>their bolts and comets from above our heads, Trinitos, Deramon, and <br>Yamdarr laughed maniacally as North Qeynos burst into Fire and Ice. <br>Holding the forefront were Balthek, Elcd, Maja, Katn, Grak, Kanos <br>Banekaos, Carlie, Shademehr, Sabretooth, Lulu, Sasprina. And of course, <br>the elusive and mysterious Druids of lore, Erico, Iisbliss and Phyndin.<br><br>As North Qeynos burnt to the ground, only one guild stood victorius. <br>Only one guild beat the test of time.<br><br>That guild was Paradigm and they were given the honor and glory for the <br>day.

After contacting Verant Interactive regarding the virus that was leaked to the EverQuest Patch Server this evening I received a response from Gordon Wrinn.  Here's the letter:<UL><I>It appears that we did patch two MS-Word '97 format Doc files that were infected with a relatively benign macro virus.  <br> <br>These viruses can only infect other files (and then only other Doc files) if they are opened in your word processor, so people who didn't open them prior to right now need not be alarmed.  We at Verant proactively work to eliminate the possibility that things such as this happen, however some safeguards were unintentionally bypassed as party of the Kunark opening.  We've closed this minor loophole and customers should not have to worry about anything such as this happening in the future.  <br> <br>We would like to extend our apologies to everyone on this matter.<br> <br> <br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Internet Relations Manager<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL><b>Update:</b> Gordon just send me the following update:<UL><i>It just occurred to me that I forgot to mention that the files on the Kunark Patch have been cleaned.  They will be replaced the next time everyone runs the "Kunark Patch" option on the patch server, and they should do so prior to attempting to open either of those *.DOC files.<br> <br>On another note, the PDF versions of the printed Ruins of Kunark manual are now available on the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark website at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/kunark/index1.jhtml">http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/kunark/index1.jhtml</a>.

As she dons her armor somehing catches her eye. In the reflection of the pool she sees figures in the shadows behind her. She spins a sword with a glowing green stone in its pommel appearing in her hand. She looks into the empty shadows behind her and murmers under her breath. She knew she was safe here, even in that moment she did not feel in danger, she just reacted on what she saw rather than what she felt and that can be dangerous. The sword vanishing from her hand she sighs and finishes putting her armor on. Looking back into the pool she frowns, the figures are still there. Three reptilian men with their hands split and bound by brass.

Here's a clip containing minimal spoilers:<UL>Small but simple shuttles will convey you to a larger ship that sits on the other side of the zone line. As a side note, before you depart, be sure to actually register Kunark at the server select screen.

I'm being emailed left and right by people from across the net reporting that a virus has been discovered in eqrokmanualsupplement.doc and everquest_manual.doc.  The virus in question is a W97M.Class Virus, but thankfully isn't the most destructive of viruses.  Here's a clip from a letter Val sent me:<UL><I>W97M.Class<br><br>Common Polymorphic Word97 macro virus.  Some variants display insulting messages like telling user "is a jerk", etc. Some variants quietly do their infections on opening and closing documents.</i></UL>I just scanned my directory with McAfee and didn't detect a thing but the reports are so numerous I decided to report it just to make people aware.  I have contacted Verant and will hopefully receive a reply shortly.<br><br>For those who have it, the virus should be easily removed by upgrading your virus scanner's dat files and scanning your harddrive.

Not only that, since you know a guide or GM is going to have to track them down some day and change their name for them, they are sucking up valuable time that could better be spent on helping players with real problems.</i></UL>

Gordon once again talked about the shipping issues and in particular the number of people who have received Kunark so far.  Here's the post from the Gameplay Board:<UL>Yes, the 90% figure that Abashi pulled out of his rear in an attempt to placate angry users who want to hit level 51 is blatantly inaccurate.<br><br><b><i>The number is pretty accurate. I noticed one poll out there showed a 30% delivery rate, but please remember that people who have received the CD are probably playing, rather than surfing the net. <br><br>One of the downsides of having so many people playing your game is that even a small percentage is a large number.

Gordon talked a bit about the appearances of some expansion pet spells on the Gameplay Board.  Here's what he said:<br><UL>I like the new abilites, but I am extreemly disapointed with the appearnce. You gave necros, Specter-ish pets, which look cool btw, why couldn't you have upgraded ours? <br><br><b><i>As we've mentioned before, pet models are limited to what can go in a global file. Spectre pets required one model be put in the Global. It was an undead critter that we figured had a high "coolness" factor. Mages on the other hand have 4 pets, which would require a lot more space to do some kind of visual upgrade to them. Furthermore, as mages summon elementals, there really aren't any other elemental models floating around game, and the djinn in the Plane of Sky is a bit of a stretch. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Verant's Gordon "Abashi" Wrinn addressed a few issues a player raised about the Scale of Wolf spell.  Here's the post straight from the Gameplay Board:<br><UL>First off, why does it drop when you are hit EVEN IF you don't hit back ? <br><br><b><i>It works just like invisibility. We wanted to give people the means to travel faster without that travel method turning into another offensive tactic. </i></b><br><br>Secondly, why does it overwrite SoW ? Verant doesn't need to stack actual spell effects to make them stack as being 'on' or 'off' - surely one spell can supercede in effect without overwriting<br><br><b><i>It overwrites SoW because it has the same effect and it does more to that effect. It's the way the spell hierarchy works. This really can't be changed.</b></i><br><br>Um, this has exploit written all over it. <br><br><b><i>We'll probably have to make the spell group-only in the near future. I'll send a note to GZ.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

As I was going through the pages of the Gameplay Board, I stumbled upon the following thread:<UL>As sad as it is, this thought actually kept me awake for a bit last night.<br>I got my copy of the Kunark expansion on Friday. With said package, I receieved a small cloth map that shows all of Norrath.. so I decided to sit down and see if I had missed anything in the 9 months I've played the game. And yes, I have - a migrane. <br>Let's first start naming spots on the map that have not been added to the game (excluiding the Kunark continent, since none of us know about it yet.. or aren't bound by a legal issue). <br><br>Continent of Odus:<br>The Hole<br>The Barren Coast<br>The Vastly Deep<br>The Gulf of Uzun<br>The Irrand Plateau<br>The Stoneburn Mountains <br>Continent of Faydwer<br>Hills of Shade<br>Rantblock's Ridge<br>The Loping Plains<br>Wayunder's Lake<br>Elizerain Lake<br>Dragonscale Hills <br>Continent of Antonica<br>Rojarkan Hills<br>Broken Skull Rock<br>Gulf of Ganthrak<br>The Buried Sea<br>The Dead Hills<br>Unkempt Woods<br>The Serpent Spine Mountains<br>Lake Neriuss<br>The Northlands<br>The Hatchland<br>Everfrost Peaks *or* The Fridgid Plains <br><br>23 zones there that haven't been added to the game. Bad, bad Verant. <br>And now, for the major nitpicks. Let's see how all these zones are joined together, shall we? <br>Odus:<br>- Most of this contintent is ok. If they ever activate the deadzones there, might be a little confusing but otherwise ok. <br>Faydwer:<br>- Lesser Faydark. As it reads on the map, a traveler to here would first run into the LFay before they can enter the GFay. <br>- Elizerain Lake. You'd almost have to hit this non-active zone before you reach Steamfront. <br>Antonica: (ohhhh.. you're going to hate me)<br>- Deserts of Ro. And a river runs through it. Um, at least, it should. This same river should also pass through the Specter Island (which it doesn't) and then empty out into the OOT.<br>- Innothule Swamp. According to the map, it should be a horizontal (east to west) zone, but instead, it's a vertical one in the game itself.<br>- Lake Rathetear/Rathe Mountains. Ok folks, which comes frist. You're going through the Karanas to get to the lower zones. You hit South Karana, then zone into Lake Rathe. But check your map: according to it, the Mountains come first THEN the lake. <br>- Everfrost Peaks. Now, we have two options here, we can either say this is the zone we all call Everfrost or we can say that the Fridgid Plain is. The problem is, if you consider the Peaks the zone we call everfrost, then why is Halas offset to the *right* of the zone, when it's in actually at the *left*. Or, you can say that the Plains is the zones we call Everfrost but then you have to wonder how would one get that far East from near the Jaggedpine Forest. <br>- Everfrost again. Take a look.. looks like there should be a way to cross the frozen waste of this icy flatland into the less flat but just as wastish and certaintly much hotter Lavastorm Mountains. This would certaintly make alot of Barbies hapier if they had a shortcut back to their homeland from the rest of Norrath. <br>And that's everything I can think of so far. Ya, I'm crazy. But you gotta admit, you love it. <br><br><P><b><I>There certainly are. When the background for Norrath was being written, future expansions, zones, sequels, etc., were taken into account. In order to develop a solid foundation, you have set some boundaries for the majority of what will ever be in order to insure that your story is cohesive. This is a lot like the fantasy books that typically have a map printed within the forward. Most of the places on the map aren't visited in every book, but they are there for future volumes. <P><br>Another thing to keep in mind is that just because a name is on the map doesn't mean that every name on the map is a zone name. For instance, the map refers to the "Plains of Karana", while there are actually 4 zones that comprise those planes. The map also refers to Jagged Pine forest, which is really a *part* of Surefall Glade, which doesn't happen to be listed. <P><br>As for your comments on orientation, I'll buy it. It's not an exact replica, but it is very similar to the types of maps produced in our history when people were learning cartography. <P><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn elaborated on a newly discovered bug on the Kunark zone "Field of Bone" during a recent visit to the Gameplay Board.  Here's the thread:<br><UL>Here is the scenario: When I zone into the Field of Bone from the Iksar town, I cant see myself on the screen, I cant turn, cant change my view. If I taunt a mob or check my inventory, the game crashes to my desktop. Other players say I am crouching... I hit D to uncrouch and still the same problem. If I attack, it says im sitting. So I<br>stand and the problem still persists.  I reinstalled my drivers.. went and downloaded the most current drivers according to the manufacturer and Verant, and reinstalled Directx7. I tried both the dx7 and glide versions for my Voodoo2 card and still no fix. I cant use my primary video driver at all (Rage Fury) so I didnt even bother with that. I have always used the v2 for EQ.<br><br>Finally I gave up, deleted the character, started anew and searched for other newbie zones... I found one. So I start hunting there, and finally die... and sure as #&$@ the bind point is in Field of Bones So now im stuck again<br><br><b><i>We've received the reports of this issue. It's being caused by a problem with one of the Field of bone files in your EverQuest directory. For some reason the patch server isn't detecting the problem and repatching it. We're not sure which file it is yet, as all of our systems here are working fine, but when we do find out we'll let you know right away.<br>If anyone who's having this problem would care to assist, you can try deleting one of the field of bone files, repatching, then seeing if it works. If it doesn't, delete another and repeat. We don't want to recommend that everyone delete all of the files as they total over 9MB.<br><br>As soon as we get it narrowed down, we'll let you know and also fix the patch server.</b></i></UL>

The talented, daring and dashing Crispin of Fennin Ro has a tale to share with us:<BLOCKQUOTE>Good day citizens of Norrath! <br><br>A few minutes ago, the first band of adventurers traveled to the recently re-discovered isle of Kunark.  The first people on Fennin Ro to set foot on Finonia Vie were Vegeetta, Minara, Azyzik, Cloudstorm and of course yours truly.<br><br>The remainder of my report will be hidden, meaning you must highlight the white area below with your cursor to view it.  I daresay I would not want to spoil all the surprises that will await you in Kunark.<br><br><font color="white"><i>The journey began at the Faydwer Docks close to the Dwarven city of Kaladim.  Six small shuttles were docked neatly in a row.  These shuttles could only carry a few people at time, but none the less they seemed capable of standing the voyage.  Upon boarding them, we waited for additional reinforcements and prepared to get underway.<br><br>A few minutes later the shuttles were launched and headed to the unknown, departing what was then the known world.  <br><br>Time seemed to freeze as we crossed the borders.  When time returned to normal my sharp elven eyes tried to penetrate at the fog ahead.  As we pushed forward it became clear that there was a massive object in front of us.  The size of this object can only be described as unworldly at best.  As we drew nearer it became apparent what it was.<br><br>Having sailed on all the known boats that exist on Norrath, my breath was taken away as I stared bleakly at the most impressive warship my eyes had ever beheld.  The Elven armies had spared no expense for this mighty ship of war.  The shuttles slowly came about and circled the ship halfway giving us a spectacular view of the massive ship.<br><br>The shuttles slowly docked one at time, allowing us to board the ship. When everything was secured the sails were unfolded and we got underway.  The voyage wasn't short, but thanks to the vessel's speed we crossed the distance of the ocean quickly.<br><br>At last we arrived at the newly opened elven outpost of Firiona Via.

Despite the announcement issued by the League of Bards, this outpost seemed to be under construction still.  Buildings were still being built, and the gates hardly seemed able to keep out invaders.  As I wandered out to the perimeter, other people were stocking up on supplies at the nearby vendors and some were even engaging in new quests.  As I scouted my surroundings, I quickly discovered that leaving the gates of the outpost would be foolish.  As a 13th season Ranger, I would have no chance of surviving any kind of encounter with the gruesome creatures lay ahead.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
I just spotted the following Patch Message annoucning several things Kunark-related.  This is a must-read for all players:<UL>April 24th, 6:00am<br>-------------------<br><br>***Press Release***<br><br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br><br>LEAGUE OF ANTONICAN BARDS ANNOUNCE NEW MAIL ROUTE<br><br>FIRIONA VIE, Kunark.  February 1, 3178--<br><br>Today, the League of Antonican Bards, responsible for maintaining communication across Norrath announced that they have established a mail route to the newly discovered continent of Kunark, located across the ocean, south and east of Antonica. The new route will carry mail from Port Faydwer to the Elven outpost of Firiona Vie, which will serve as main port-of-entry and battle staging grounds for adventurers arriving in the new lands.  <br><br>The outpost of Firiona Vie was established soon after word reached King Tearis Thex, King of Felwithe and leader of the Koada`Dal, that his daughter of the same name had been kidnapped by lizard creatures now known to be named the Iksar.  The King commissioned Galeth Veredeth, once-Lord and High Paladin of Tunare, to establish the outpost on Kunark and return his daughter to him, lest Veredeth's life be forfeited for failure.  "I cannot allow those vile creatures to keep my daughter and only heir to the Koada`Dal throne from fulfilling her destiny," says King Tearis Thex. "Galeth Veredeth had best not fail me."<br><br>A high level source in Neriak confirmed today that the Dark races will not be outdone in the endeavor to acquire new territory and power.  The source said, "We believe that this nonsense about a kidnapped princess is just that.  If the lesser `Dals and their human and stunted playthings think that they can wander the new lands unchecked, they are quite mistaken."<br><br>Many adventures are already beginning the trip to Kunark, a journey that is not without its perils. A human and halfling party was apparently slaughtered upon their arrival after mistakenly boarding a Kunark-destined ship in the Oasis of Marr.  They evidently were not aware that the ship would arrive at a new port, firmly controlled by Neriak and their brutish muscle from Oggok and Grobb.  <br><br>Druidic scouts have reported that there are some strange phenomena present throughout the new lands.  "The land appears to have been ravaged by some viscous magical storms at one time," said one follower of Karana. "Some magics that we have come to count on just do not work."  This phenomenon was apparently noticed to an extreme in the vicinity of a mountain peak rumored to be inhabited by followers of Veeshan.  "Only through divine intervention did I escape that place with my life."<br><br>The League of Antonican Bards' representative in Kunark met with Galeth Veredeth, Governor of the Outpost Firiona Via.  "It is my sincerest hope that many adventures loyal to the King will assist us on our Quest to return the Princess to her home," says Veredeth. "Though the dangers in these new lands are formidable, I have no doubt that many will come, if for nothing else than to reap the spoils." <br><br>					#	#	#<br><br><br>*Kunark Goes Live*<br><br>In case the announcement from the League of Antonican Bards wasn't to your liking, we are very pleased to announce that the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark expansion has been implemented on the live servers.  Adventurers who have installed the expansion and registered their account key may now visit the new lands, exceed level 50, create Iksar characters, and access Kunark-related content in general. <br><br>Here is a short list of some of the new features available to those who have upgraded:<br><br>- Players may now reach level 60!<br>- Over two dozen new zones to explore!<br>- Tons of new quests, items, and spells to complete, acquire, and learn!<br>- All-new creatures and weapons, with new art too!<br><br>There are two minor issue that is known and that we are still in the process of rectifying: Action-based sounds for the Iksar and some other Kunark creatures are still being worked on.  In other words, you might hear a giant mosquito "walk" by you, and your Iksar might sound curiously like a human when he is hit with a sword. In addition, there is some additional work required with a couple of the starting Iksar quests.  This may cause you to reach a point where you cannot proceed further in a quest.  This will not however cause you to turn in items and be denied your reward, so feel free to explore these new quests.  We will be finishing them over the next week.<br><br>We would like to offer special thanks everyone who has been patient over the past couple of weeks while we've readied EverQuest for this awesome event.  It has been quite a challenge for our team to get everything ready for launch, and your support has been instrumental in this process.  We'd also like to thank the beta test team, who in the face of all of the new content managed to keep their thoughts between themselves and the Dev Team, while working to make the game better for everyone.  <br><br>If you ordered Kunark on or before 4/19/2000 and do not receive your Kunark CD by today, we will be posting instructions later today on how to claim the shipping refund as well as the free month of EverQuest promised last week. <br><br>Thank you,<br><br>The EverQuest Team<br><br>April 24th, 6:01am<br>-------------------<br><br>*K-Patch Required*<br><br>All Kunark-enabled players should run the Kunark Patch on the Patch Program control panel prior to attempting to enter Kunark.<br><br>*Manual Supplement*<br><br>The files named everquest_manual.doc and everquest_manual.txt in your EverQuest directory are now obsolete.  Downloaded to you today are two new files, labeled EQROKSupplement.doc (MS-Word '97 Format) and EQROKSupplement.txt (Text Only).  These files are supplements to the manual distributed with the retail version of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark.  For those who upgraded, PDF files of the manual will be placed on the official EverQuest web-site at www.everquest.com. A new patch message will announce their availability.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

As of this writing it is 9:23AM CST.  I just spent thirty minutes running to the docks and Kaladim to discover the newly created Shuttles.  After waiting about five minutes the all the small shuttles took off.  A very cool sight it was seeing the would-be invasion force depart from the known world on such little transports.  <br><br>After sailing around the zone for a while the shuttles stopped and everyone was teleported back to Butchers Block.<br><br>I have had some reports of new (non-beta testers) players being able to create Iksar, but after trying it myself I had no success.  I haven't received word from Verant on when Kunark has officially gone live, but I'll keep you posted.

Firiona Vie, Sionachie, Thubr Axebringer, Sir Jevik Isqual, Al`Kabor,<br>Dreezil Pocketdip, Dagda Icefury, Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever, and<br>Lyirae Oakwynd arrived at the tiny Elven stronghold in the new lands. Tired<br>from their journey, they stepped off of the Maiden's Voyage and began to<br>rest for a few moments.  Galeth Veredeth came to greet them as they were<br>resting. <br><br>Galeth Veredeth shouts  "Lieutenant Thorn! Please do me the honor of taking<br>our friends on a tour of the surrounding area" <br><br>The Lieutenant approached the group and began to lead them out of town.  As<br>they were walking along, the Lieutenant made an effort to point out the<br>creatures and structures to Firiona and her companions.  He informed them<br>that the Iksar are an ancient race. The ruins that lie all about the land<br>show that the Iksar were a great empire whose influence seemed to stretch<br>the length of the continent. 1900 years ago, the Iksar attempted to attack<br>and take control of Faydwer but the navy was wiped out by a terrible storm<br>and they were not successful. Something terrible happened to cause the once<br>great empire to crumble.  None of the local inhabitants of the area seem<br>very friendly with the exception being the Drixies. <br><br>As the party began to walk back, Danak Dhorentath, an Iksar shaman shouted<br>"Visitors! Watch your backs, the Drolvarg are attacking!"  At that moment,<br>four Drolvarg appeared and ambushed the group.  Danak and an Iksar Initiate<br>joined the group in fighting the Drolvarg. After the Drolvarg were dead,<br>Danak asked if everyone was alright. <br><br>While Firiona was explaining to Danak that they were seeking out the Ring<br>of Scale, he seemed generally concerned for their safety.  He told them<br>that their journey would be incredibly long and dangerous. Danak offered a<br>quicker means for them to get there.  He offered the use of his special<br>portal.  Within a few moments, with serpentine speed, Danak Dhorentath<br>grabbed Firiona Vie by the arm. Taking her by surprise he pulled her into<br>the gate, which disappeared with a hiss leaving nothing more than the smell<br>of ozone hanging in the air. <br><br> "I must return and tell King Thex the terrible news. Bind the vile Iksar<br>at once! Dagda, Thubr, Jevik and I will escort the prisoner back to the<br>mainland!" Galeth Veredeth shouted. <br><br>They escorted the Initiate to the Maiden's Voyage and traveled to Faydwer. <UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen01.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen02.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen03.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen04.jpg">Screenshot #4</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen05.jpg">Screenshot #5</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen06.jpg">Screenshot #6</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen07.jpg">Screenshot #7</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen08.jpg">Screenshot #8</a></UL><br>
