<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon's been keeping busy on the boards as normal.  Here's the next round of quotes and excerpts straight off the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043616.html"><b>/Loc Issues</b></a><br>/loc is a very artificial, out-of-character, and therefore undesirable method of direction-finding. It was supposed to be taken out when EQ first went live, but as I understand it it was left in due to public opinion. We really wouldn't want to expand on its use in this manner, as it would cause it to become commonplace.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043578.html"><b>The Risk</b></a><br>Every player has the ability to choose what level of risk is palatable to them. Those who choose to take on greater risk should be able to expect greater rewards and less restrictions upon what they can or cannot do. For example, some people are so opposed to risk that they'll only fight in a dungeon if it is crowded and there is no chance of death, while others will run headlong into certain death all for the prospect of the excitement that comes with the battle. <br><br>Experience loss is part of that risk and part of what creates excitement by making character death something that you definitely don't want to happen. <br><br>The death penalty is one of those things that virtually no one likes, yet is part of what makes the game fun and exciting.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043617.html"><b>Use of Triggers in EQ</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: For example you manage to kill the level 50 lords, now, deeper into the dungeon (behind you is great) 5 lvl 45 body guards come running to the scene... lets say it takes them 1 minute to get to the party. This would increase the danger of such a place, would increase the danger of the lord IMMENSELY.. would completely and utterly destroy the idea of 'camping' this guy... and of course, a single death, would be felt by all.]</i> <br><br>We certainly have the ability to do things of this nature. Many people can probably quote a few spawns that do something like this already. It would be really nice in the one-way dungeons though :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043649.html"><b>Account Problems - How do you prove hacking?</b></a><br>I sincerely apologize if you were treated unfairly here, however the security of an account is the responsibility of the owner of the account. In other words, the owner of an account is reponsible for anything anyone does while logged into the account. <br><br>There are a number of people out there perpetuating scams to try and gain access to accounts, and the best thing that we can do is warn people not to give their passwords away, and remind everyone that we will never, in game or otherwise, ask them for their password. Beyond those warnings, each player needs to be actively aware of attempts to get their confidential information.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043668.html"><b>More on Timorous Deep</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Do things like the mobs agro range, "social" qualities, and faction happen before or after the itemization step?]</i> <br><br>Typically yes, then items are created and placed as they fit into the context of the previously laid foundation. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyway, if indeed itemization is the last step for t'deep, ask that team to go back and look again - I think they missed a few things...]</i> <br><br>We'll look at the other issues you've brought up again when the guys are testing the itemization.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043646.html"><b>PoF Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well you fixed the fingers.. but obviously you didn't want to increase the total number of mobs in Plane of Fear. So what did Verant decide to do? Yeah, they removed 4 of the 8 boogeyman spawn.]</i><br> <br>Actually that's not entirely correct. In the Plane of Fear, there are a total number of creatures possible that can spawn. For each one, there is a percentage chance that a given mob will spawn. This means that the number of creatures of a given type that can spawn on a complete repop of the zone varies. For instance, it is possible that 50 boogeymen could spawn, just as it's possible that zero could, but on average it is usually a given number. <br><br>For the purpose of raising the spawn percentages for the frightfingers, we reduced the percentages of Phoboplasms (which can drop any of about 8 different class-inspecific items), not boogeymen. <br></UL>

The <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/indev.html">In Development</a> section of the official EQ page was updated today.  Here's the scoop:<UL><b>Zones</b><br><br>Two new areas tentatively titled The Hole, and The Warrens will be accessible via Paineel and Erudin on Odus. The zones will be free of charge and available via an optional patch. The Hole is a high level dungeon which represents the ruins of Old Paineel, destroyed long ago in a war with between the Erudites and the Heretics. The Warrens is a dungeon for lower level players, and is the original home of the Kobolds upon Norrath. More information regarding these new zones will be made available as their release date nears.<br><br><br>-------------------<br><br><br><b>General Issues</b><br><br>Though a majority of the EverQuest development team's time has been dedicated to creating The Ruins of Kunark expansion, we are now turning our attention to the enhancement of current game play related features, such as dungeon tuning and balancing, and quest implementation. Following are the features we plan to focus on:<br><br>- The Make Poison trade skill for Rogues will be updated.<br><br>- The retuning of Permafrost into a higher level zone.<br><br>- The retuning of Mistmoore and Gukbottom.<br><br>- Implementation of class-related weapon quests such as the Fiery Avenger quest.</UL>

I'm proud to announce that the <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/askthearchmage/05-19-00.shtml"><b>first edition of Ask the Arch Mage</b></a> has been published!  Ask the Arch Mage is a column where players can submit questions to Verant Interactive's Geoffrey Zatkin.  For those who don't know who GZ is here's a quick bio:<UL><b>Geoffrey Zatkin aka &#8220;Geoffrey Z&#8221; aka &#8220;GZ&#8221; </b><br>Game Designer<br>3 years at Verant<br>B.S. in Psychology (not computer science)<br>Works with the other game designers at Verant Interactive (so can ask questions around)<br>Specialty of the EQ Magic System<br></UL>Topics in this edition range from the Jammin Geoffrey Doll, to the portals in the Timorous Deep.  Even if your not a caster or hybrid you'll find it an enjoyable and interesting read.  Here's an excerpt:<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Naming pets is a cool idea, and one that we have talked about. There are, however, several problems. We already maintain a live staff that checks names as the go in. Adding something that let our staff check pet names as they come in to the world would be using too many real world resources for such a small payoff (adding more staff simply to let players name their pets just won&#8217;t happen). If a player could only pick one name, and their pet got named that every time would be more feasible - but that would mean that your fire elemental and your air elemental would both be named &#8220;flamtar&#8221; or some such. We would probably have to make pet names unique at that point - since we don&#8217;t want two pets having the same name for player recognition reasons. </I></BLOCKQUOTE>Once again I would like to thank Geoffrey for taking the time to do this column.  Thanks GZ! <br><br>Enjoy!

Gordon made a few afternoon posts on the Gameplay Board today.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043559.html"><b>Mobs in Dungeons, should they respawn?</b></a><br>There are certain areas where we've linked spawns in this fashion, however it's not on as wide a scale as advocated here. <br><br>Dungeons are designed to support multiple groups at one time, and this type of design would cause a few problems with that goal.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043325.html"><b>Monk Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The reward that "compensates" for the 14 pound weight limit, poor night vision, lack of equipment, ugly magic resistances, lack of damage until level 30+, player killing due to Feign Death nerf, 60-100+ hour quests, and dignity of being poor for most of a monk's life,,, namely, that we are not dependent on equipment, is almost out of the window now that they made our weapons way better than our hands.]</i> <br><br>Hey now, let's not forget the nifty monk-only weapons that have been turning up lately, and the fact that monks remain the best toe-to-toe melee damage dealer out there.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043193.html"><b>The Hero Complex</b></a><br>You've made some very good points here. Sometimes maximum efficiency isn't linked to doing the most amount of damage possible in the smallest amount of time. Sometimes things can take a little more finesse, and work out better in the long run. <br><br>Thanks for your post. I'll be happy to bump it back up to the first page :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043190.html"><b>Timorous Deep Drop Problems</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Unless I'm mistaken, mobs in Tim Deep drop no loot what so ever. No cash, no nothing...]</i> <br><br>Doh! <br><br>Actually I just checked with the Live team and they are almost done itemizing this zone. Assuming that there are no new items that require an item patch, it won't even require a server outage to bring the new data online.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043154.html"><b>Mez/Enthrall Line</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Recently, I have tried Enthrall on Aviaks, Splitpaw Gnolls and even a few treants. It seems all that gets wiped off the aggro list is me. After the enthrall wears off, the MoBs go right back to attacking my party members. This also happened when I was trying to save a low level SK from a Lioness in E Commons.]</i><br> <br>The Mez series has always had a chance to remove all or some from the hate list. At lower levels, I believe that it's a 100% chance. As the level of the creature goes up, the chance of an integral memory blur goes down. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043057.html"><b>Bugs Discussed</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The high level slowing spells (Togors, Turgurs, chanter spells) are still being overwritten by the weaker slow spells. It seems that spell stacking for the slow spells are reversed, that the weakest spells override the stronger spells.]</i> <br><br>This problem is known and on the list. It occurs because the "attack speed slowing" spells are the only ones where a lower number in the database is "better". We're going to give the programmers a little more time to address this. We also have an idea for a work-around that would make it work correctly. We'll keep you informed. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: The Howling Harpoon has a proc of Memory Blur, however when this weapon procs Mem Blur it procs on the wielder of the weapon...]</i> <br><br>That's not right then. I'll mention it to the live team. A fix should go live in the next item patch. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Just hand the Harpoon to the NPC before you attack, then loot it off him when you are done.]</i> <br><br>ROFL. I'd have to recommend against that :)<br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Actually these things need fixed as well as others.  The hate list bug where the mobs tend to remember the healers upon their repop.]</i> <br><br>Actually they aren't *remembering* anyone, they are "catching" the hate list from another NPC somewhere, and the healer just happens to be at the top. The team is looking into this. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: There is also a pet bug that I've noticed where (I play on a PvP teams server) my pet will end up attacking people in my group (even those on my team which I should NEVER be able to hit).]</i> <br><br>I've seen pets attack people in PvP situations who they should normally be able to attack after someone uses an AoE spell or something, but not as you describe. Any more info you can provide would be helpful. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: How about fixing some of the quests like Canabalize II?]</i> <br><br>"Fix" wouldn't be the correct term. "Put in in the first place" would be. The quest is done and is just waiting for a zone-data patch (doesn't require a full server outage) to go in. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Also, for us Barbarians, when is Verant going to remove the banker in Hallas from being part of the Rogue faction?

I'll ask around to see if this is something that could be easily changed or whether it is something that's too far in to change at this point.

Gordon announced a few changes coming to the experience awarded in Kunark dungeons on the Gameplay Board.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043569.html">the post</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>Based upon some of the posts here, we've reviewed the experience-point (XP) rewards in the Kunark dungeons and some of the outdoor areas and found them to be deficient. Dungeons on Kunark were in general supposed to be giving more experience than equivalent level dungeons on the other three continents, where in-fact they were giving slightly less. <br><br>Over the next couple of days, we'll be updating the experience rewards for many of the Kunark zones, making them more profitable in terms of experience, in light of the increased difficulty and danger associated with them.<br><br>We wish to extend thanks to the players who brought this issue to our attention.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Thanks Impedance!

Keiote' sent me the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>With the lack of Innoruuk's presence on Norrath, the Teir'Dal<br>quest for more of their father and creator. Away in the plane of Hate,<br>Innoruuk battles the denizens of the light races as they breech his realm,<br>while on Norrath those of his children who have been blessed by him seek out<br>more of his power that has been scattered about Norrath. This brings us to<br>the present day and what the Teir'Dal call the "Age of Hatred".<br><br>             The known fact that dark elves were created from the limbs and<br>souls of the first Elven king and queen only fuel their hatred and drive<br>them to seek out more of their history. Complex and intricate details lead<br>the Teir'Dal to clues of a tome, the writing is said to portray them during<br>the Elder Age in which they have little knowledge of. Rallied by the leaders<br>of many Teir'Dal guilds, a small army of powerful dark elves gathers for the<br>worldwide search of this tome. The clues known to them often point to a<br>select group of light dwellers acting as protectors of the realms. It is<br>written that these "protectors" keep the tome of Innoruuk hidden away from<br>the searching eyes of Innoruuk's children, least the dark ones find and<br>learn what true power they may wield from what they find in the scriptures.<br><br>             A young prophet of Innoruuk, Saphyre M'yrrdin has foretold of<br>this group of  "protectors" and their intentions to keep the searching Teir'<br>Dal at bay. In the forest of Nektulos a forming army of Innoruuk's children<br>gather together in preparation to recover their history and what they see as<br>a way to turn the tides of war.<br><br>            Informants of the light races relay this news to the Protectors<br>and in turn the plot is revealed of the forming army of Teir'Dal and their<br>mercenaries. In the days that follow, the Protectors gather together and<br>spirit away the lost tome in hopes to keep the dark ones from ever finding<br>the power of their lineage. All across Norrath trouble begins to brew, for<br>the seeking eyes of Innoruuk's children hound the Protectors at every turn.<br>This brings us to the present and final search of the Teir'Dal. The<br>Protectors are just out of their grasp.<br><br><br>OOC/<br><br>In this quest their will be two armies of players, any light races<br>interested in joining will be known as the Protectors and act as the<br>guardians of the tome. They will travel together as one large army and evade<br>the Army of Hate until a final battle is declared on open and equal ground.<br>Those interested in joining the Army of Hate must be pure dark elven, troll<br>or ogre. In hopes to keep the battle fair to all, we will limit the amount<br>of players on each side to an equal number, this will depend on the response<br>of both the light and dark races. After the armies are set, the Protectors<br>will begin to evade and elude the Army of Hate at all cost. At each of the<br>first three encounters of the armies they will stop and choose a champion<br>for each (three different champions for each battle). The champion of each<br>army will battle unaided to the death. The winning champion of each battle<br>will receive a backpack of loot that he or she can distribute to their army.<br>After the third battle of champions, the two armies will take to the Arena<br>for the final showdown. This will be a battle of honor, if you are killed<br>during the battle you are asked to honorably sit aside until either the<br>light or dark army has won, do not enter the arena and begin fighting again.<br><br>    More details for this quest will be leaked to the public when the event<br>draws near.<br><br>If you are interested in partaking in this quest you may contact:<br><br>Princess Stexxy at <a href="mailto:RoyalHarmony@hotmail.com">RoyalHarmony@hotmail.com</a> to join the Protectors<br><br>Of myself<br><br>Keiote' Drak'Uben at <a href="mailto:darkmoon@graffe.com">darkmoon@graffe.com</a>  to join the Army of Hate</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Here's the latest round of quotes and excerpts from posts made by Verant Interactive's Gordon Wrinn:<ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043232.html"><b>Outstanding Kunark Issues</b></a><br>Go to: <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum1/HTML/002034.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum1/HTML/002034.html</a> <br><br>George Scotto, the Director of Customer Service for The Station is handling any outstanding Kunark shipment issues directly now. You can email him at <a href="mailto:gscotto@station.sony.com">gscotto@station.sony.com</a>. Be sure to send your station name and shipping address. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043218.html"><b>Level 50+ Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: No, I don't mean class abilities and such. Dungeons, items/loot, quests, that kinda thing. Like are any other dungeons going to get redone any time soon? Like Runnyeye maybe? Will there be any new items attainable by mid-levels? Quests...?]</i> <br><br>Absolutely. The next dungeon up for a bit of a revamp is Najena. As for quests, items, etc., those go in all the time and will continue to go in. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Though the majority of the posters here are in the 50+ club, the majority of the subscribers are not.]</i><br> <br>You are very correct. We are definitely concerned about the satisfaction of the lower-level players as well, it's just that the higher level stuff is getting a lot of attention right now. Keep in mind that it is generally the higher level folk that feel that they were running out of content, which is why they are probably more vocal than the rest. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043210.html"><b>The Posters</b></a><br>Brad and I are primarily the ones who post here, and to be honest we're trying to get away from replying to flames, as it appears that it only encourages more of them. There is a bit of a fine line though, for example, the last post that I made before this one had a subject line that was a flame, but the content was fine. <br><br>In most cases, I stop reading a thread when I come across the first personal attack or flame. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043215.html"><b>When will higher level tracking get revamped?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I know that you mentioned, Abashi, that it would be looked at. This was pre Kunark. Is it going to get looked at soon?]</i> <br><br>Actually both Brad and I mentioned that it was something for which we had no short term plans. It's one of those things that we wouldn't mind seeing at some point, however it's not on the radar at the moment. Should we place it on the development schedule at any time, we'll let everyone know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043202.html"><b>More on Weight Issues</b></a><br>I referred many of the weight issues, including the monk staves, to the live team yesterday. It looks as if a standard equipment template was used when creating the items, which explains why the same weight problem is present across a number of them. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041799.html"><b>Glamour of Kintaz Bugged?</b></a><br>Assuming that all of this information is correct, it does sound like there may be a problem. I'll get with GZ tomorrow and find out exactly what it is that this spell is supposed to do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043034.html"><b>Level 51+ Spell Dropping Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Later you admitted that "when you checked" (read: when you were playing on your own, and realized the bug 1) existed and 2) affected you), the spells weren't dropping.]</i> <br><br>Actually I didn't check it out with a play character, I popped a GM character into a dungeon, cleared it, and looked at what dropped, since people on the boards were insisting that they weren't dropping. I generally don't have time to check every issue that popps up here personally, as I'm not a tester, but I will do this when it appears that information I've received from other sources may be mistaken. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: What kind of company completely dismisses a bug report, fails to even check it, and insists that their customers are wrong? Because it's obvious no one bothered to check the drops when people reported the problem.]</i> <br><br>The best response that I can offer is that mistakes do happen, whether they be my mistakes or other people on the team. In this particular case, the spells were set to drop at a certain percentage in the database, but that percentage was below a meaningful threshold where people could "expect" to get spells. I'm sure that a few people did find spells, but not enough for their discoveries to be meaningful. <br><br>I do think that we've gotten better overall at recognizing, agreeing with, and rectifying these problems than we have in the past. The Alchemy example that some are fond of bringing up is a perfect example of one of our worst failures, taking months to recognize and rectify. Things since then have been handled on the order of days rather than months.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043092.html"><b>Voodoo5 and EverQuest</b></a><br>Our test department hasn't obtained one of these yet, however assuming that the card supports all of the correct APIs, there shouldn't be a problem. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043131.html"><b>A Random Incident</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Now, I have this great item, but I'm torn. The first roll, while with an incorrect range, came up with a value that matched a group member. I've seen situations like this for lesser items, but never really cared what happened. In those other situations, generally there was a reroll, but not always. Thus, I want to see what the community at large thinks. Was the right thing done? Should I not worry about it? Just so it's clear, neither of us could directly use the item, but I'm still left with a feeling of guilt over the whole thing]</i><br> <br>My personal opinion only, but since the roll came up with the number of a valid group member, I'd've let it stick. In the end though, it's up to you and the members of the group. It is nice to see though that you are sensitive to the feelings of those around you. It's things like this that really support the community that we are trying to provide.</ul>

Gordon has made quite a few posts this afternoon on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043174.html"><b>Admitting When Wrong</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why then is it so difficult to at least admit the possibility that the design team may have erred when they did not give rangers ANY defensive skill increases post 50? Why can't you at least admit that perhaps the thousands of Rangers who are being pounded by enhanced Kunark Mobs while being condemned to having Level 40 Defense skills might know something that you and your design and testing teams don't? Why can't you at least check it out?]</i> <br><br>Because we sat down as a group and specifically designed out all of the aspects of the level 51+ skills and abilities. It wasn't an oversight, but something that we planned. <br><br>As for having "level 40 defensive skills", it doesn't work like that. Proficiency in a particular skill is not merely a function of skill points, but a function of level and stats as well. In other words, just because you stop gaining in one particular part of the equation doesn't mean that your proficiency hasn't changed. For instance, a level 60 warrior with 200 1HS hits better than a level 40 warrior with 200 1HS.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043177.html"><b>The Experience Curve</b></a><br>The experience curve from 50 to 60 is pretty steep, and we don't expect that everyone will reach 60. It was made this steep since the majority of the people at level 50 are very experienced players, and would tear through those 10 levels regardless what the curve is. The first person reached 60 in 17 calander days, with a ranger of all things, so it looks like the curve is ok. We really didn't expect anyone to be able to do it for about a month, so the players surprise us yet again :)<br><br>My recommendation to everyone would be to stop watching their experience bar and concentrate instead on exploring new areas and enjoying yourselves. You'll find that things go a bit quicker this way.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043178.html"><b>Philosophy</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: After listening to Verants own misconceptions about their game I've come to the conclusion that Verant doesn't actually understand their creation. Certain item are REQUIRED to be effective in the game. A lvl 50 warrior is pretty useless with a combine long sword, much the same as a wizard is useless with a low intelligence. Verant makes the drops impossible to get by the average player he in essense said you are not important to them. <br><br>I am tired of Verants arrogance. I began play within days of release. They have had great success so far, but over the next year and half many of their "Talent" will be working for other companies or collecting unemployment. There are many new games on the Horizon "one aptly named Horizon" that will be collecting my money instead of Verant. <br><br>The arrogance of your "Vision" is appalling. If you lacked your current success you'd have made things MUCH different than it is. You can lie and say it would have remained the same but it would still be a lie.]</i><br><br>If a person is concerned with their character being as effective as possible, they need to have the best loot and put in the time to get it. If they aren't as concerned with this, then they have other options available to them. <br><br>I don't really understand how you feel that this philosophy (requiring people to work to get decked out in the best gear) is bad. One of the main things that people asked for in EQ's design phase was for equipment to mean something, not only for it to have impact on how they fight, but they also didn't want to see everyone else decked out in the exact same gear as they have. This brings us back to prestige.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/043130.html"><b>Keyed Dungeons</b></a><br>The keyed dungeons were thought up as a way to keep people from accidently entering areas of extreme difficulty, instead making it so they must specifically wish to enter the dungeon. It also has the added benefit of having people think twice before they choose to enter an area where the risk of death and possible corpse loss (due to the inability to raise a sufficient party to retrieve your corpse) is higher than most other areas. <br><br>By making it harder to enter a dungeon, players must make a real choice as to whether or not they want to absorb the risk associated with entrance. We also wanted to increase the challenge by getting rid of "zone fighting" in some of the Kunark Dungeons. Overall it's working pretty well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042805.html"><b>Necro Spell Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, I know that this isn't a major concern with the "live" team right now... but I would like to bring it to your attention. I play on the Team server Vallon Zek, and I just recently aquired the new Splurt Spell. <br><br>Today while fighting a halfling druid.. I attempted to cast Splurt on this Druid.. and I got a message..<br>"The spell did not take hold"<br>Tried again..... Same result. <br><br>After talking to this druid... turns out all he had cast on himself was Skin Like Nature, and Group Magic Resist. Now I'm not sure which spell was preventing me from Casting Splurt on this Druid... but later on I got a chance to test it on an unbuffed Druid.. and it stuck with no problem. <br><br>I'm not sure if this was intentional or not.. but I thought I'd bring it to your attention. ]</i><br><br><br>It's probably the hitpoint regen component on Skin Like Nature that's causing splurt not to stack. Splurt uses different code than most DOTs, which probably explains why others don't have this problem.

I spotted the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042635.html">following thread</a> on the Gameplay Board which contains post Gordon Wrinn created:<UL>Who are you to decide whats best for the game? <br><br>I think the people should decide whats best for EQ.<br>If melee want to bind themselves in the city. Let them.<br><br>If people feel that classes are unbalanced ask them why and make those changes.<br><br>It is the people that make the game. Isn't it?<br><br>Or you may not see people sign-up for Star Wars or EQ2 later.<br><br><b><i>Frankly Brian, as the designers of the game, we are the ones with personal and financial stakes in its success. Someone (or some entity) has to be the final arbiter of what is good or not good for the game, and it this case it is those people on the EQ tuning team. The people, those who choose to voice their opinion, whether on the boards, through email or feedback, or with their monthly subscription and the people they refer, do have say in this process, and we have implemented TONS of features and changes based upon opinions coming directly from the players. <br><br>This doesn't mean however that we can implement every suggestion we receive, or even every suggestion that the people at-large feel is a good idea. We are in the business of keeping our customers, all 217K+ of them, happy, given their multinational orgin, separate desires and expectations, even when those desires, expectations, and needs are in direct conflict with those of another customer. This "direct conflict" is best illustrated by the class-envy posts, emails, and feedbacks we regularly receive. <br><br>Keep in mind that for every class that is absolutely sure that they deserve some new upgrade, enhancement, or feature, there is another class that will feel that they are equally deserving of an upgrade, enhancement, or feature if the first class gets their way. People who have been on this board for a while will be able to attest to this, given that "nerfs" have historically caused less problems than enhancements. This is because when we "nerf" something, only the users of the "nerfed" aspect become upset, whereas when we enhance something, we often start receiving complaints from multiple other sources. A good example of this is when the hitpoints were upped on Paladins and SKs. This action spawned complaints from warriors, rogues, monks, rangers, and bards.<br><br>In the end, we provide a service offering, and if people like that offering they choose to buy our product. If they continue to like our offering from month to month, they choose to continue buying our product through the monthly subscription fees. We'll always strive to encourage you to make this choice, and will continue to listen to the opinions and suggestions expressed in this and other forums to do everything we can that is good for the game as a whole. <br><br>By "good for the game as a whole", I speak of customer retention. Since customer retention is directly tied to customer satisfaction, that is the focus of every decision we make. We believe firmly that people want a game that is challenging and provides some sort of reward for playing, which is why we are so firmly against suggestions that make the game too easy, or reduce the rewards such as by making powerful items extremely commonplace. This is a delicate balance, and though I am sure that we could make a number of people happy in the short term if we made the game easier, made advancement quicker, made classes more powerful, or made items more plentiful, the end result would be that people would become bored much quicker, and leave the game at a greater pace. <br><br>As for our customer retention, an excess of 70% after 14 months is unheard of in the industry, and therefore we are very proud of it. Certainly it could be better and we will continue to aim towards doing more things in game that helps keep people interested in the game. Given though that our customer have very different needs and desires as mentioned above, its very possible that some of the things we do along these lines will upset some customers while encouraging others to stay with us longer. For instance, a good number of people wanted zones that were much more difficult, being far more challenging than those in old EQ. A good number of the Kunark dungeons were built with this in mind. Of course, by doing what one group of customer wanted in this case most certainly has made another group unhappy. Only time will tell what the right decision was in this case, but we continue to believe that challenging and intriguing content is the best strategy to follow.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

EverQuest is alive and kicking according to a recent <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042909.html">response posted</a> by none other than Verant Vice President Brad McQuaid.  Here's the original post followed by his response:<UL>Guys, the ranting (while legitimate) is getting nowhere. ROK is out and that was Verant's last major hurrah. They're not going to change any class fundamentally even though rangers suck post 50 (not a knock, rangers; I've read many of your posts).<br><br>I doubt we'll see any new servers (server pop has actually fallen on most servers and the new ones are horribly underpopulated). They might retool some under-utilized zones, but I wouldn't hold my breath even on that one.<br><br>It was a good run, and the game will linger around like that mother-in-law who's only staying for 3 days, but Verant is clearly moving on. <br><br>It's an equation: put a skeleton screw on EQ and let the addicts continue to pay $10 a month (might lose 50,000); meanwhile, focus attention on Star Wars and gain 100,000+ subscribers. <br><br>Maybe Verant will surprise me and make some actual changes. Problem is, if they do make changes it will be of the Newbie-Guard variety. <br>Wow, re-reading this, they've turned me into a real cynic now :(<br><br><b><i>Quite untrue, actually.<br><br>Nobody from EQ is going to the Star Wars team.<br><br>The EQ Live team continues to pour their heart and souls into the game, making it better with each patch. The rest of the EQ team members continue to work on EQ related projects -- in fact, Kunark has sold so well that we're seriously considering a second expansion.<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn just responded to the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message_flat.asp?topic=5664567&page=2">Discussion Thread</a> dedicated to the <a href="/lore/playerviews">Player View</a> that was posted earlier today.  In the message Gordon clears up some misconceptions about the post he made last night:<UL><I>In regards to the news posting made today on the front page, of course I<br>meant GM and Guide *characters* are the ones that are excluded from being in<br>player guilds, and vice versa, not the person behind the keyboard in<br>general.  Once in a play character (which is on a different server from that<br>which they are a GM or Guide on), the GM or Guide is NO LONGER a GM or<br>Guide, but a player, and subject to all of the same rules and policies that<br>apply to players.<br><br>The authority of a GM or Guide solely follows the character that is flagged<br>as such. When in a play character, GMs and Guides are not permitted to<br>acknowledge that they hold that position on another server, in order to<br>avoid event he appearance of impropriety.<br><br>I do wish that we could get away from the idea that "someone must be abusing<br>their authority", unfortunately the only way to do this would be to bar the<br>GM and Guide staff from playing the game.  Considering that the Guides are<br>volunteer players, and GMs mostly come from the player populace, and<br>considering that everyone generally wants the GMs to play the game so that<br>they can stay in touch with problems that a player faces, this is something<br>that we'll probably always have to deal with.<br><br>I realize that there are some who believe that someone who is a GM or Guide<br>shouldn't be allowed to be in a player guild with their player-character<br>either, but we do have to draw some line as to what is reasonable.  What is<br>a guild really?  It's basically a group of characters who've decided to hang<br>out together in game.  There's nothing really "special" that changes when<br>someone accepts an invite into a guild, so there's no reason to bar GMs or<br>Guides from joining guilds with their play characters. As I mentioned above,<br>the only thing we could do would be to bar them from playing altogether, and<br>that just wouldn't be reasonable.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Thanks Gordon!

Brennos Oakkeep has wrote a little piece regarding a recent post Gordon Wrinn made on the Gameplay Board yesterday.  I have posted the writings he sent to me as a new <a href="/lore/playerviews">Player View</a> and entitled it <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid958660199,57860,">GMs in Player Organizations</a>.  The article begins on this note:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>Gordon says:<UL><b>"...but GMs and Guides are not allowed to belong to<br>player guilds, and player's aren't allowed to belong<br>to GM/Guide guilds. <br><br>If you have any specific information, such as server,<br>names, etc., feel free to email me (gwrinn@verant.com)<br>and I'll be happy to look into it further."</b></UL><br>Ok, I have always been one of those Verant supporters,<br>but this is just flat out wrong or Gordon is out of<br>touch with what's going on and needs to hush up.

Maybe Gordon means with their<br>GM/Guide character, but I know they have secondary<br>characters in guilds.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>This is a very interesting topic and issue that hasn't received a lot of attention in the past.

Diggles informed me of the following event:<BLOCKQUOTE>Event on Vallon Zek pvp teams server, Saturday May 20th 10pm EST<br> <br>Flyin&#8217; Fatties: An Iggles Production, Designed by Diggles <br>It is time for us to put a temporary end to the in team fighting and squabbling for a night blessed by the Father of Hate himself. On the eve of Saturday May 20th, 10 pm EST, Da Bashin&#8217; Iggles shall bring forth a contest of skill and ability like no other: The Flyin&#8217; Fatties. (This is an evil team only event. If you are a goodie and found you will be KOS) <br><br>We will meet at 10est at the outpost in Overthere. Casters will bind all melees and we shall march forth to the Gorge of the Scorpikis. Upon reaching the gorge all casters will bind themselves close by and the event shall begin! <br><br>Event 1: Single Fatty Distance Jump <br><br>This is only avaible to shaman above level 24. Each race troll and ogre will select 6 members to represent their race. The contestants will then soc (spirit of cheetah spell) up a designated ramp and attempt to hurl themselves the furthest into the gorge. The jumps will go in heats separated by a short period (1st troll in group vs. 1st ogre in group etc) <br><br>Event 2: Look at that blubber fly! <br><br>Again, 6 members of each race, troll and ogre, will be selected to represent their race. Contestants will be given levitate and on command hover out into the gorge, they will then cancel their levitate (via pumice) and plummet to the earth. The fatty remaining with the fewest amount of HP after the fall shall be deemed the winner. If no fatties survive the fall then&#8230;we will all have a good laugh! <br><br>Intermission <br><br>Gnome kabobs and the finest brews of Innoruuk shall be served for all to enjoy. 2 storytellers shall be selected to share some sort of interesting tale. <br><br>Event 3: Free Style <br><br>This event is open to all that come! Buffers will be available at the top of gorge to provide contestants with requested buffs. Contestants are then given a chance to freestyle to the bottom of the gorge. Judges will observe both take off, midair, and landing. Judging is completely subjective and high biased =). <br><br>Event 4: Drunken Stooper Race <br><br>12 contestants will be chosen of any race to park in the binge drinking contest/race. All contestants will be gathered at point A and required to drink X amount of a provided alcoholic beverage. They will then attempt to reach point B and /poke the judge there. They then race to the gorge and the first one to land shall be deemed the &#8220;Drunken Stooper King&#8221;. <br><br>Event 5: Bikini/Swimsuit Contest <br><br>9+ female contestants will be put through a series of trials to choose the &#8220;Queen of Hate&#8221; award winner. The judging panel will be made up of 9 males, 3 from each race. Female contestants my bribe, seduce, or otherwise manipulate the judges anyway they see fit. =) <br><br>Closing <br><br>Prizes will be awarded to the winning contestants and the remaining food and beverages shall be handed out. (need suggestion, possible another story telling). We will then conduct the duel of the millennium. Vllad vs. Tipp. The winner shall take home the title of the &#8220;THE FAT&#8221; and force to plunge to his death and &#8220;leave his mark&#8221; on Norrath, while the loser will retain &#8220;THE OBESE&#8221; title.

Gordon was back on the boards answering several posts and even creating a thread himself.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040848-2.html"><b>Item Weight</b></a><br>I'm having some of the weights on Monk stuff looked at today. In other news, Darkforge armor (SK) is having its weight lowered, and should go live the next time we patch items.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041816.html"><b>Ranger Issues</b></a><br>The whole ranger-defense thing is coming from the logic that: At 50 they are balanced. At 60 everyone else gets bonuses to defense, and rangers don't, therefore they aren't balanced. <br>The problem with this logic is that we don't balance classes on a skill-by-skill basis. We balance them as a complete offering. Everything that a class has is part of the equation. The fact that skill-point allocations, ratios, and percentage change as you go level to level is not in and of itself indicative of an imbalance. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041625.html"><b>Wind Saber</b></a><br>Bow's themselves cannot proc (randomly cast a spell on a successful hit). This item was probably supposed to be setup as a charged item. I've asked the Live team to check it out.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042708.html"><b>Frontier Mountains Nerfed?</b></a><br>We haven't retuned the zone. One thing to keep in mind is that most spawns have a level range that they can spawn in. For instance, hill giants can be anywhere from level 33 to 37 in most zones that they are found. <br>My advice would be to kill off all the blue ones, which will again give the higher level ones a chance to spawn again.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042549.html"><b>Buying Stackable Items in Bulk</b></a><br>This subject has come up several times in the past few weeks. As I mentioned before, this is something that we would like to do at some point in the future, but it's not something that we can assign a high priority to right now. It's certainly a good idea and a possibility for the future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042725.html"><b>Do enchanters have any hope of getting illusions past level 44?</b></a><br>No new illusions are planned for enchanters at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042731.html"><b>EQ on a 56K Modem</b></a><br>The majority of the data that EQ transmits is well within the capabilities of even a 28.8K modem. The notable exceptions to this are zoning, which will take longer with a slower connection, and very large battles (ones with a bunch of people involved in the same relative area, such as dragon runs), which may at times cause some data queueing. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042734.html"><b>Caster Items in Kunark</b></a><br>More caster items should turn up as people get around to the deeper areas of Kunark. Charasis, Veeshan's Peak, most of Chardok and Sebilis still haven't been explored yet. The other dungeons as well. <br>As people's comfort level grows, I think we'll start seeing the items turn up as peopel head deeper into the dungeons.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042741.html"><b>Items 'Morphing' Into Something Else?</b></a><br>We did have a morph bug about six months ago that would occasionally cause something to change into another item. In all cases I've seen of this, the item would change to something not at all related to the original item, since the process through which it happened was more or less random. For instance, I had a friend who's glowing torch turned into a pair of cloth pants. <br>Though it certainly may have been possible for something to morph from a silver ruby veil to a silver star ruby veil, my first guess would be that it may be possible that you bought the wrong veil and only noticed it now. It's very easy to miss "Star" in the description. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042829.html"><b>Hasten/Zephyl</b></a><br>We've figured out the problem with these two NPCs not popping/depopping. It's being updated on Test now, and will go to production when next we patch zone data, which will probably happen in a day or two, as a complete server outage isn't required.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040476.html"><b>Quest Armor Camp Time Excessive?</b></a><br>A 72 minute spawn seems ok. Quests for items aren't supposed to give instant gratification. I think that one of the problems we are running into is that when people want an item, they want the item NOW, and any time that it takes to get the item is considered a camp. <br>Things need to take time, or the prestige that comes with having is gone.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042832.html"><b>More on Spawning Time</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Now in a recent Post (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040476.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040476.html</a>) You claim the spawns are 72 mins? Get real.]</i> <br><br>I said that a 72 minute spawn on a particular NPC that the person talking about didn't seem out of line. In any case, I think a common misconception that people have is that everyone should be able to get every item. This isn't the way it works. There are things that drop in game once every few weeks, and are truly not meant to be common equipment for everyone. Certianly there is an element of luck involved (right place at right time). <br>Does this mean that people who play more have the opportunity to get more things? Yes. Is that something that should be changed? No. Everyone can't get every item. If that were the case, there'd be nothing special about getting a very nice item, and at that point we might as well sell everything on vendors. Players need to decide what items are important to them, and put in the time that they feel that that item is worth. No one forces anyone to spend 8 hours camping an item. People spend 8 hours camping an item because they feel that it is worth it. <br>The addition of some random loot tables in some areas of Kunark helps the "casual" player that you speak of even more. No longer do they have to track down one particular NPC, but only be fighting in that dungeon or area to have as good a chance of getting a particular item as anyone else fighting in the area. <br>Back to my point, there is no magic shot to make everything "fair" for the casual gamer, because you can always find someone who's more "casual" than the last guy. There's no way to make things equal in every respect whether people play an hour per week or 20 hours per week, and we probably wouldn't want to pursue it even if there was, as it would probably make the game boring. <br>The best advice I could offer to people in your prediciment would be to play the game first, and see what items you get, rather than deciding what items you want, and then playing the game to that end. Discover the items through your normal travels rather than scheduling your travels around items you want. You might find this path a bit more rewarding.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/000040.html"><b>The Hole</b></a><br>We're probably looking at sometime late June for a release of the Hole. There have been a few setbacks in its development, including the zone designer having a couple weeks of jury duty, followed by some meetings that the people working on it were involved in. <br>The zone geometry is done, and now it is being textured. After that we have objects, lighting, sounds, NPC pathing info, population, and itemization. </UL>

Five stars are awarded to the Ruins of Kunark in a recent <a href="http://www.gamesfirst.com/reviews/rick/Kunark/kunark.htm">review published by GamesFirst</a>.  Here's clip from this review:<UL>But the most obvious differences in Kunark are the big ones&#8212;like a whole new continent, for instance. With over 20 zones, many of them for higher-level players, Kunark is a sprawling and nasty place. A word of warning: be very careful where you tread in Kunark. Some of the zones are insanely dangerous, and even players in the high 40s have found it impossible to retrieve their corpses from the hairier zones. But there are some very nice hunting areas for mid-levels as well; zones like the Lake of Ill Omen or Warslik&#8217;s Woods are vast and provide good hunting for levels from 15-35 or so. Even better, the zones are so large and the creature spawns so prolific that camping is not a problem&#8212;at least yet. So far, you can always find something to hunt in Kunark. And from what I understand, the exodus of adventurers to Kunark has left many camps in the Old World open as well. </UL>Use the link above to read the article from start to finish.

Being an evil roleplaying guild, roleplay events will be included among the traditional races (Nektulos), newbie quests (Nektulos) and so on, with prizes being awarded. Later on there will be an opportunity to purge the lands of carefully selected wood elves. What they carry is yours to keep. (I call this 'wood elf pinata') We also have spent much time acquiring the services of many noble and persons of good intent to fight and die in our very own gladiatorial games. Feel free to bring your own gladiator, or bet on the outcomes. The owner of the winning gladiator will receive a reward. (Entry fees undecided at this point, this is a roleplay event as much as a standard tournament) This event will be held in East Commons.<br> <br> <br>Dark Magi Shannyn t'Daisemi<br><a href="http://www.shadow-striders.com">http://www.shadow-striders.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>

Hot off the pages of the Gameplay Board, here is today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042515.html"><b>Pet Regen Rates</b></a><br>Pet regen rates haven't changed. I imagine that you might have gotten a new or higher level pet. Though newer and higher level pets do get more hitpoints, their regen rate is always the same number of hitpoints per tick.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042528.html"><b>Hangman's Noose (haste) From Trakanon Seems to be Broken</b></a><br>I've forwarded this to the test team so that they can have a look. I'm not sure off the top of my head what level haste this item is supposed to have, but assuming that your times are correct it does appear to be broken.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042509.html"><b>Clarifying Previous Post</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: A few weeks ago 2HS was fixed by changing the minimum damage that it would do. Was this change for 2HS only, or does it apply to weapons of all types?]</i> <br><br>It applied to all 2-Handed weapon types. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: There are many relatively slow 1H weapons (delays of 35-40) that did not perform as well as their lower-delay cousins. Do high delay 1H weapons now perform as well as low delay 1H weapons of the same ratio?]</i> <br><br>Lower delay weapons still have an advantage over their high delay counterparts of the same ratio due to the way the damage bonuses are applied. <br><br>For instance, assume that a 8-point bonus will be applied on a weapon. In 4 seconds, a 20 delay weapon would apply that bonus twice, whereas a 40 delay weapon would apply it only once. However, if the 40 delay weapon were 2-handed, it would apply a larger bonus.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042496.html"><b>More on Corpses Decaying</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Reason Why Corpses Should NOT Disappear.  Though I have not personally ran into the problem of having a corpse disappear, I am sure I will. But is this realistic? No! Though the flesh and bone of a corpse may rt all it wants, the fact is: ARMOR DOES NOT ROT AS QUICKLY AS FLESH!So why not have the corpses turn into skeletons after a while? The armor would still be on it, and we can all live in peace.]</i> <br><br>Corpses decay in EQ due to the need to maintain a playable framerate for people in the game. As many people have mentioned in some other threads, the number of corpses in the vicinity directly impact the framerate that people experience. Each corpse must be drawn on the screen. Packing tons corpses in close proximity basically has the same effect on framerate as packing a ton of live characters in the same area.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042495.html"><b>AE Mez</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: This is one I cannot fathom for the life of me. in another post, it was mentioned that a pet is "part of the person" by a GM when explaining why pets could not be charmed. Ok...doesnt make total sense to me...but ok. <br><br>That being the case, why in blazes are group pets...including my own little sword and shield...effected by a spell that doesnt hit group members? If they are a part of me...or even if not...they sre still a member of the group. <br><br>Abashi, could you either; <br><br>A. Look at this and see if a change is needed or,<br>B. Give me a rational explanation why it is like this?]</i><br><br>Does it actually hit them, meaning that they get mez'd and stop fighting, or are they just counted in the total number of criters that can be affected?<br><br><i>[Quote from original post: To put it another way, if I use color flux and color shift while two pets are after the mob, I now have three hostile mobs (two pets and the origional) on me untill the pet owners can call them off....which is not always that fast.  So in short, yes it hits them and they become the enemy as soon as the mez breaks. And since I cant control my pet, I have to run and or kill it.]</i><br> <br>Well that certainly doesn't sound right. I'll have the test team check it out and see what we can do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042486.html"><b>Tranquil Staff Proc is Still Broken</b></a><br>Ack, I knew I forgot to announce something. The staff is fixed, but you'll need to get ahold of a GM to trade it out for a working one. The current one you have thinks that it is out of charges.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042471.html"><b>A Big Problem with Gyrating Goos</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Gyrating Goos, a level 28ish mob [in dalnir] now proc a poison which does 800-900 points of damage!]</i><br> <br>Ouch. That certainly doesn't sound correct. I've got the live team checking it out now. We'll do a special zone-patch for that once it is corrected.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042442.html"><b>Rotting Corpses</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Blah, its NOT fun and exiting to have your corpse rot!!! Dont even try to tell me that! You cant say, i know its exciting for you]</i><br> <br>Very true, in the same fashion that getting severely injured or killed in extreme sports isn't fun either. However, the prospect of that, however remote, does lend a good amount of excitement to the endeavor. If we start retrieving corpses in order to eliminate corpse loss, then the challenge and discretion imparted to its prospect is also null and void. <br><br>Given that corpses must disappear for multiple technical reasons including framerate, and the fact that we cannot build a server to track an infinite number of corpses, we've engineered the possibility of a lost corpse and items as part of the game in the same fashion as done by other games in the genre. <br><br>As always, I would recommend that if a specific aspect of the game provides more risk that is palatable for you, you might not want to engage in that aspect. In other words, if a dungeon is basically unexplored and not populated with people that can help you, you might want to visit places that are safer.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042384.html"><b>Login Server Inaccurate</b></a><br>There's really no way for the client to determine whether it is down, or just busy and not responding in a given amount of time. Either case provides the same information back to the client, that being that the login server is unreachable. <br><br>Perhaps we should change the message so that it points people to the network status page in the event that the outage is planned.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040807.html"><b>Howling Stones</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The reason for this is simple: THE QUEST FOR THE KEY IS TOO DIFFICULT!]</i> <br>I've asked the Live team to take a look at the rate at which Charasis keys are entering the world. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: last i heard if a rogue picks it group is transported in, and i believe it is the same with the key. otherwise as you say it wouldn't be worth it, the jade chokidai prod is generally camped for people who want to use it... its worth a decent ammount, and you have to use one to just get a key?]</i> <br><br>That teleporter being pickable was a mistake which is why we did those corpse recoveries for the few rogues who picked into the zone. <br><br>As for the keys, each key transports one person, so everyone in your group will need one. Also keep in mind the difficulty in doing a corpse recovery in a zone that has a keyed entrance. Make sure that you have some friends with their own keys as well :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042013.html"><b>Track Corpse Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: While you are taking a look at the: <br><br>1) Spell Drops<br>2) Uber Guards (that see Invis.) <br><br>Please do us a favor and fix Track Corpse as it hasn't worked since the expansion came up! You cast this spell and it does absolutely nothing except put an icon on your screen. <br><br>Since you gave us the spell...please go about the process of testing it out and providing a fix for it.]</i> <br><br>I've forwarded this to the test team to check it out. Thanks for the info.</UL>

Gordon Wrinn again address the subject of melee players paying an NPC in a city for a bind on the Gameplay Board.  Here's part of the original post followed by Gordon's response on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042444.html">the thread</a>:<UL>That's Verat's customer service policy, it seems. You take what they offer, or get out. You do NOT want fries with that, but you DO want a chocolate milkshake. This is NOT Burger King, you have it our way or you don't get the damn thing.<br>This is from EQVault:<br><br>------------------<br><br>Poll Results & New Poll Question <br>[12 Comments] - Aurum @ 4:35 PM PDT <br>The results are in from last week's poll that asked if you thought melee classes should be able to pay an NPC for a bind in a city. The results are:<br><br>Yes: 76.6% - 3264 votes<br>No: 23.3% - 996 votes<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Add to this the vast number of threads posted on this board about melee binding, and if you go through them all, you will find similar percentages. About 70% of the posters are strongly in favor of it, becuase they are damn tired of trying to find a bind at off-peak times. About 10% are againt teh idea. The remaining 20% don't really care, but see nothing wrong with it.<br><br>So, this is an example of an issue that a fairly large percentage of players feel fairly strongly about, in general. There has been NO EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER of why having an NPC in the city that charges 20pp for a bind, or other similarly limited and expensive solutions to this problem, would be in any way negative. Here, in fact, is the latest response from Verant, and is typical of anything else they've previously said on the issue:<br><br>-----------------<br><br>I'm sorry guys, but the binding issue is absolutely a dead horse, which is why I'm not jumping in the threads to remind everyone about that more than once a month or so. <br><br>The game has been out for over a year. In that time, melee characters have survived and prospered, even though the binding arrangements haven't changed. Melee characters will continue to thrive without implementing something such as this that would drastically change the pace of the game, game balance, class interdependency, and the penalty for death. <br><br>Binding is an advantage of being a pure caster in the same fashion that the ability to dish out melee damage, wear protective armor, etc., is an advantage of being a melee player. My advice to you is to make friends with clerics, wizards, druids, and anyone else who can make your travel go quicker. <br><br>-Gordon<br><br>----------------<br><br>That's their response to the concerns of the players. No real reason is given, except to say that giving the melee classes the ability to bind themselves would change the game balance, with which most people would agree. He conveniently ignores the plethora of suggestions that do not involve giving the ability to melee classes and thus avoiding the balance problem. <br><br>This is a rant about Verant's attitudes towards it's customers. I am SICK and TIRED of being treated like a small retarded child by a company that I am paying for a service. It seems the vast majority of what Verant calls customer service amounts to either patting me on the head and telling me it'll all be okay, or snidely insulting my intelligence.<br><br><b><i>There are times where majority opinion does not necessarily point to something that is good for the game, and it is in these cases where, though the outcome might be a bit painful, we need to decide what is in the best interest of the game as a whole. I would imagine that we could get a similar number of people agreeing if the question was "Is your class underpowered?", or "Should it be easier to level and acquire good equipment?", or "Should new characters start out with some money?"<br><br>In this case, we believe that wide-scale melee binding, whether in the form of allowing an NPC to bind melee characters in city zones, or allowing casters to bind melee characters anywhere, would be bad for the game as a whole. It reduces class interdependency, the penalty for death, the incentive for people to protect the melee characters at all costs, and the incentive to avoid getting in over your head. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

You wouldn't know it in the latest Patch Message, but high level spells are again dropping.  Here's the word from Gordon Wrinn:<ul><i>I've no problem admitting that it was messed up, I just didn't want to announce in the patch message that the spell drops were adjusted until I had a chance to get in and test it out myself. <br><br>The spell drops were addressed in this patch. I still feel a bit uneasy about the frequency of those drops, but we'll wait to see what happens before taking further action. Just a reminder to everyone searching for spells, you'll want to be in dungeons, in Kunark, killing things that are generally over level 45 to get a chance of getting those spells.<br><br>-Gordon</I></ul>This was spotted on the Gameplay Board.
