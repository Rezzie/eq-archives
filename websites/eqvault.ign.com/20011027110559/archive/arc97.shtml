Lordstyle sent me some interesting information about his call to Zomax this morning.  Here's his letter:<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, I just got off the phone with Zomax this morning, at 8:35am PST, and I found out <br>something interesting about the trouble that was being caused with the shipping.<br> <br>First, I would like to say that when I called, I was helped by a very friendly lady, who not only <br>found my order but even told me that it had been shipped and was due to arrive today.<br> <br>The problem that Zomax had, which seems to be confirmed by more then one person at Zomax, <br>is that they ended up with corrupt files and had to fill each persons order by hand, since the <br>computer that normally handled it had corrupt files. Thus, the long long delay in people getting <br>their game. As she explained it, having to fill out the order papers manually slowed the shipping <br>down a great deal. So I would tell all users out there to please hold on, they should be getting <br>them in the next day or two.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Myrlynn sends word of a GM event on Solusek Ro:<BLOCKQUOTE>"Calling out to the power that be on Solusek Ro. Come forth with you <br>mighty guilds and compete for the destruction of Qeynos!" was broadcast <br>by Lady Daegarmo.<br><br>Quickly, and efficiently, the power of Paradigm raced to the fair city <br>of Qeynos to stake forth their claim as the most honorable Guild of <br>Norrath. Khengus Myrlynn, the esteemed Tracker stood first in the <br>majesty of Lady Daegarmo.<br><br>Five guilds arrived to do battle with the foul forces of North Qeynos <br>with only one be able to be crowned champion and be given their shot at <br>destroying all of South Qeynos. <br><br>The evil minions of North Qeynos were soon set upon by the forces of <br>Paradigm and their opponents. Led by the hoots and hollers of <br>Paradigm, Drakarr the Ungodly began to draw the lifeforce from the fould <br>citezens we were to slay. Behind him, the Heavenly powers of the <br>Priestess Tannis wrought the famed healing powers to keep them all <br>going. Pure Magiks were released upon our foes from the glittering <br>hands of Sorasil the Merciless as the harmonies ripped power throw the <br>lyranthe of the famed Aanani. Not to be outdone, Tallyn Masterougue <br>instilled terrors in the eyes of the enemy and unmercifully backstabbed <br>them with a laugh and an evil grin.<br><br>As North Qeynos was slowly brought to its knees, the Fiery Vengeance of <br>Paradigms Guildmaster Steiner Ewokbane brought down target after foul <br>target. Energizing the powers that be, swiftness and toughness were <br>dealt out by the members from the side. Excelander, Narg, Etal, Danmir, <br>Gukak and Keryl were there to make our fine attackers stronger and more <br>powerful. <br><br>Joining the Priestess in bringing forth energies from their gods, <br>Evldor, Skoal, Sarion and Dulfar brought glory to our name. Hurling <br>their bolts and comets from above our heads, Trinitos, Deramon, and <br>Yamdarr laughed maniacally as North Qeynos burst into Fire and Ice. <br>Holding the forefront were Balthek, Elcd, Maja, Katn, Grak, Kanos <br>Banekaos, Carlie, Shademehr, Sabretooth, Lulu, Sasprina. And of course, <br>the elusive and mysterious Druids of lore, Erico, Iisbliss and Phyndin.<br><br>As North Qeynos burnt to the ground, only one guild stood victorius. <br>Only one guild beat the test of time.<br><br>That guild was Paradigm and they were given the honor and glory for the <br>day. They were also given the chance to bring South Qeynos to its <br>knees in worship, alas that is another story.......<br><br>Khengus Myrlynn<br>Paradigm<br>Solusek Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

After contacting Verant Interactive regarding the virus that was leaked to the EverQuest Patch Server this evening I received a response from Gordon Wrinn.  Here's the letter:<UL><I>It appears that we did patch two MS-Word '97 format Doc files that were infected with a relatively benign macro virus.  <br> <br>These viruses can only infect other files (and then only other Doc files) if they are opened in your word processor, so people who didn't open them prior to right now need not be alarmed.  We at Verant proactively work to eliminate the possibility that things such as this happen, however some safeguards were unintentionally bypassed as party of the Kunark opening.  We've closed this minor loophole and customers should not have to worry about anything such as this happening in the future.  <br> <br>We would like to extend our apologies to everyone on this matter.<br> <br> <br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Internet Relations Manager<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL><b>Update:</b> Gordon just send me the following update:<UL><i>It just occurred to me that I forgot to mention that the files on the Kunark Patch have been cleaned.  They will be replaced the next time everyone runs the "Kunark Patch" option on the patch server, and they should do so prior to attempting to open either of those *.DOC files.<br> <br>On another note, the PDF versions of the printed Ruins of Kunark manual are now available on the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark website at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/kunark/index1.jhtml">http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/kunark/index1.jhtml</a>.

As she dons her armor somehing catches her eye. In the reflection of the pool she sees figures in the shadows behind her. She spins a sword with a glowing green stone in its pommel appearing in her hand. She looks into the empty shadows behind her and murmers under her breath. She knew she was safe here, even in that moment she did not feel in danger, she just reacted on what she saw rather than what she felt and that can be dangerous. The sword vanishing from her hand she sighs and finishes putting her armor on. Looking back into the pool she frowns, the figures are still there. Three reptilian men with their hands split and bound by brass. A soft voice fills her head and after a moment she realizes it is hers.*<br> <br>"The gresh maj are coming"</i> </UL><br><br>------------------<br><b>Valkryst Angelheart</b><br>Daughter of the Dawn<br>Defender of the Dawn</UL>Thanks!

Here's a clip containing minimal spoilers:<UL>Small but simple shuttles will convey you to a larger ship that sits on the other side of the zone line. As a side note, before you depart, be sure to actually register Kunark at the server select screen. Failure to do so will mean that you are teleported back to Kaladim when trying to board the ship and forced to wait 30 minutes for the next boat. (We learned this the hard way.) </UL>The <a href="http://www.incite.com/incite/plsql/incite_main.main?in_id=10473">second feature</a> and <a href="http://www.incite.com/incite/plsql/incite_main.main?in_id=10472">third feature</a> both consist of new Kunark screenshots.

I'm being emailed left and right by people from across the net reporting that a virus has been discovered in eqrokmanualsupplement.doc and everquest_manual.doc.  The virus in question is a W97M.Class Virus, but thankfully isn't the most destructive of viruses.  Here's a clip from a letter Val sent me:<UL><I>W97M.Class<br><br>Common Polymorphic Word97 macro virus.  Some variants display insulting messages like telling user "is a jerk", etc. Some variants quietly do their infections on opening and closing documents.</i></UL>I just scanned my directory with McAfee and didn't detect a thing but the reports are so numerous I decided to report it just to make people aware.  I have contacted Verant and will hopefully receive a reply shortly.<br><br>For those who have it, the virus should be easily removed by upgrading your virus scanner's dat files and scanning your harddrive.

Today's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035168.html">Board Thread of the Day</a> is once again found on the Gameplay Board.  This time around the subject tackles the naming policy.  Here's a clip from the post:<UL><i>Okay, I'm not a complete name Nazi. Someone wants to name their female wood elf druid Anygel, that's fine with me. Name your mage Raistlin, or your wizard Mirlyn, I don't have a problem with it. But when you see players running around with "Cocoapebbles", "Player", and "Spudsmckenzie" running around, you know that the player hasn't just deliberately ignored the name creation rules, they've gleefully trampled them into the dirt. Not only that, since you know a guide or GM is going to have to track them down some day and change their name for them, they are sucking up valuable time that could better be spent on helping players with real problems.</i></UL>

Gordon once again talked about the shipping issues and in particular the number of people who have received Kunark so far.  Here's the post from the Gameplay Board:<UL>Yes, the 90% figure that Abashi pulled out of his rear in an attempt to placate angry users who want to hit level 51 is blatantly inaccurate.<br><br><b><i>The number is pretty accurate. I noticed one poll out there showed a 30% delivery rate, but please remember that people who have received the CD are probably playing, rather than surfing the net. <br><br>One of the downsides of having so many people playing your game is that even a small percentage is a large number. The 10% of people who haven't received their CDs by today still represents over 10,000 people. This is clearly unacceptable and we are doing the best that we can to expedite the delivery of everyone's CDs. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon talked a bit about the appearances of some expansion pet spells on the Gameplay Board.  Here's what he said:<br><UL>I like the new abilites, but I am extreemly disapointed with the appearnce. You gave necros, Specter-ish pets, which look cool btw, why couldn't you have upgraded ours? <br><br><b><i>As we've mentioned before, pet models are limited to what can go in a global file. Spectre pets required one model be put in the Global. It was an undead critter that we figured had a high "coolness" factor. Mages on the other hand have 4 pets, which would require a lot more space to do some kind of visual upgrade to them. Furthermore, as mages summon elementals, there really aren't any other elemental models floating around game, and the djinn in the Plane of Sky is a bit of a stretch. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Verant's Gordon "Abashi" Wrinn addressed a few issues a player raised about the Scale of Wolf spell.  Here's the post straight from the Gameplay Board:<br><UL>First off, why does it drop when you are hit EVEN IF you don't hit back ? <br><br><b><i>It works just like invisibility. We wanted to give people the means to travel faster without that travel method turning into another offensive tactic. </i></b><br><br>Secondly, why does it overwrite SoW ? Verant doesn't need to stack actual spell effects to make them stack as being 'on' or 'off' - surely one spell can supercede in effect without overwriting<br><br><b><i>It overwrites SoW because it has the same effect and it does more to that effect. It's the way the spell hierarchy works. This really can't be changed.</b></i><br><br>Um, this has exploit written all over it. <br><br><b><i>We'll probably have to make the spell group-only in the near future.

As I was going through the pages of the Gameplay Board, I stumbled upon the following thread:<UL>As sad as it is, this thought actually kept me awake for a bit last night.<br>I got my copy of the Kunark expansion on Friday. With said package, I receieved a small cloth map that shows all of Norrath.. so I decided to sit down and see if I had missed anything in the 9 months I've played the game. And yes, I have - a migrane. <br>Let's first start naming spots on the map that have not been added to the game (excluiding the Kunark continent, since none of us know about it yet.. or aren't bound by a legal issue). <br><br>Continent of Odus:<br>The Hole<br>The Barren Coast<br>The Vastly Deep<br>The Gulf of Uzun<br>The Irrand Plateau<br>The Stoneburn Mountains <br>Continent of Faydwer<br>Hills of Shade<br>Rantblock's Ridge<br>The Loping Plains<br>Wayunder's Lake<br>Elizerain Lake<br>Dragonscale Hills <br>Continent of Antonica<br>Rojarkan Hills<br>Broken Skull Rock<br>Gulf of Ganthrak<br>The Buried Sea<br>The Dead Hills<br>Unkempt Woods<br>The Serpent Spine Mountains<br>Lake Neriuss<br>The Northlands<br>The Hatchland<br>Everfrost Peaks *or* The Fridgid Plains <br><br>23 zones there that haven't been added to the game. Bad, bad Verant. <br>And now, for the major nitpicks. Let's see how all these zones are joined together, shall we? <br>Odus:<br>- Most of this contintent is ok. If they ever activate the deadzones there, might be a little confusing but otherwise ok. <br>Faydwer:<br>- Lesser Faydark. As it reads on the map, a traveler to here would first run into the LFay before they can enter the GFay. <br>- Elizerain Lake. You'd almost have to hit this non-active zone before you reach Steamfront. <br>Antonica: (ohhhh.. you're going to hate me)<br>- Deserts of Ro. And a river runs through it. Um, at least, it should. This same river should also pass through the Specter Island (which it doesn't) and then empty out into the OOT.<br>- Innothule Swamp. According to the map, it should be a horizontal (east to west) zone, but instead, it's a vertical one in the game itself.<br>- Lake Rathetear/Rathe Mountains. Ok folks, which comes frist. You're going through the Karanas to get to the lower zones. You hit South Karana, then zone into Lake Rathe. But check your map: according to it, the Mountains come first THEN the lake. <br>- Everfrost Peaks. Now, we have two options here, we can either say this is the zone we all call Everfrost or we can say that the Fridgid Plain is. The problem is, if you consider the Peaks the zone we call everfrost, then why is Halas offset to the *right* of the zone, when it's in actually at the *left*. Or, you can say that the Plains is the zones we call Everfrost but then you have to wonder how would one get that far East from near the Jaggedpine Forest. <br>- Everfrost again. Take a look.. looks like there should be a way to cross the frozen waste of this icy flatland into the less flat but just as wastish and certaintly much hotter Lavastorm Mountains. This would certaintly make alot of Barbies hapier if they had a shortcut back to their homeland from the rest of Norrath. <br>And that's everything I can think of so far. Ya, I'm crazy. But you gotta admit, you love it. <br><br><P><b><I>There certainly are. When the background for Norrath was being written, future expansions, zones, sequels, etc., were taken into account. In order to develop a solid foundation, you have set some boundaries for the majority of what will ever be in order to insure that your story is cohesive. This is a lot like the fantasy books that typically have a map printed within the forward. Most of the places on the map aren't visited in every book, but they are there for future volumes. <P><br>Another thing to keep in mind is that just because a name is on the map doesn't mean that every name on the map is a zone name. For instance, the map refers to the "Plains of Karana", while there are actually 4 zones that comprise those planes. The map also refers to Jagged Pine forest, which is really a *part* of Surefall Glade, which doesn't happen to be listed. <P><br>As for your comments on orientation, I'll buy it. It's not an exact replica, but it is very similar to the types of maps produced in our history when people were learning cartography. <P><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn elaborated on a newly discovered bug on the Kunark zone "Field of Bone" during a recent visit to the Gameplay Board.  Here's the thread:<br><UL>Here is the scenario: When I zone into the Field of Bone from the Iksar town, I cant see myself on the screen, I cant turn, cant change my view. If I taunt a mob or check my inventory, the game crashes to my desktop. Other players say I am crouching... I hit D to uncrouch and still the same problem. If I attack, it says im sitting. So I<br>stand and the problem still persists.  I reinstalled my drivers.. went and downloaded the most current drivers according to the manufacturer and Verant, and reinstalled Directx7. I tried both the dx7 and glide versions for my Voodoo2 card and still no fix. I cant use my primary video driver at all (Rage Fury) so I didnt even bother with that. I have always used the v2 for EQ.<br><br>Finally I gave up, deleted the character, started anew and searched for other newbie zones... I found one. So I start hunting there, and finally die... and sure as #&$@ the bind point is in Field of Bones So now im stuck again<br><br><b><i>We've received the reports of this issue. It's being caused by a problem with one of the Field of bone files in your EverQuest directory. For some reason the patch server isn't detecting the problem and repatching it. We're not sure which file it is yet, as all of our systems here are working fine, but when we do find out we'll let you know right away.<br>If anyone who's having this problem would care to assist, you can try deleting one of the field of bone files, repatching, then seeing if it works.

A <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5504883">special thread</a> on the General Board has been created for you to post your comments, opinions and reivews of Kunark.  <br><br>I understand and appreciate the dreadful situation many of the players are in for those that have order and not received Kunark yet.  But regardless of this, please do not turn it into a "I haven't gotten RoK yet, Verant stinks" flame war.  A new poll on this issue will be going up shortly.  For the time being, a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5504947">special thread</a> for those who haven't received Kunark has also been created on the General Board.<br><br>Thanks!

The talented, daring and dashing Crispin of Fennin Ro has a tale to share with us:<BLOCKQUOTE>Good day citizens of Norrath! <br><br>A few minutes ago, the first band of adventurers traveled to the recently re-discovered isle of Kunark.  The first people on Fennin Ro to set foot on Finonia Vie were Vegeetta, Minara, Azyzik, Cloudstorm and of course yours truly.<br><br>The remainder of my report will be hidden, meaning you must highlight the white area below with your cursor to view it.  I daresay I would not want to spoil all the surprises that will await you in Kunark.<br><br><font color="white"><i>The journey began at the Faydwer Docks close to the Dwarven city of Kaladim.  Six small shuttles were docked neatly in a row.  These shuttles could only carry a few people at time, but none the less they seemed capable of standing the voyage.  Upon boarding them, we waited for additional reinforcements and prepared to get underway.<br><br>A few minutes later the shuttles were launched and headed to the unknown, departing what was then the known world.  <br><br>Time seemed to freeze as we crossed the borders.  When time returned to normal my sharp elven eyes tried to penetrate at the fog ahead.  As we pushed forward it became clear that there was a massive object in front of us.  The size of this object can only be described as unworldly at best.  As we drew nearer it became apparent what it was.<br><br>Having sailed on all the known boats that exist on Norrath, my breath was taken away as I stared bleakly at the most impressive warship my eyes had ever beheld.  The Elven armies had spared no expense for this mighty ship of war.  The shuttles slowly came about and circled the ship halfway giving us a spectacular view of the massive ship.<br><br>The shuttles slowly docked one at time, allowing us to board the ship. When everything was secured the sails were unfolded and we got underway.  The voyage wasn't short, but thanks to the vessel's speed we crossed the distance of the ocean quickly.<br><br>At last we arrived at the newly opened elven outpost of Firiona Via.  We quickly disembarked and crossed the long length of the dock to set foot on the isle outpost.  <br><br>A kind enchanter named Azyzik volunteered to bind the entire group to the outpost.  <br><br>Feeling glad to have set foot on solid land once again, I gazed round about me to get a better feeling of my new surroundings.  Despite the announcement issued by the League of Bards, this outpost seemed to be under construction still.  Buildings were still being built, and the gates hardly seemed able to keep out invaders.  As I wandered out to the perimeter, other people were stocking up on supplies at the nearby vendors and some were even engaging in new quests.  As I scouted my surroundings, I quickly discovered that leaving the gates of the outpost would be foolish.  As a 13th season Ranger, I would have no chance of surviving any kind of encounter with the gruesome creatures lay ahead.  I was marooned.</font></i><br><br>Crouching down to the earth, I contemplated what my next move would be on this dangerous, but exciting new frontier.<br><br>Crispin<br>Ranger of Tunare<br>13th Season<br>Fennin Ro<br><UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/leavingfaydwer.jpg">Leaving Faydwer</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/leavingfaydwer2.jpg">Leaving Faydwer, Part 2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/theunknown.jpg">Drifting in the Unknown</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/objectahead.jpg">Object Ahead!</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/voyage1.jpg">Docking with Mothership</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/massive.jpg">A Ship of Massive Size</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/arrivingatport.jpg">Arriving at Port</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/defenseweapon2.jpg">A defensive weapon</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/thefrontier.jpg">The Unknown Frontier</a></UL></blockquote>Check out those screenshots, several are high resolution shots with little or no compression.  <br><br>Good luck, Crispin!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
I just spotted the following Patch Message annoucning several things Kunark-related.  This is a must-read for all players:<UL>April 24th, 6:00am<br>-------------------<br><br>***Press Release***<br><br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br><br>LEAGUE OF ANTONICAN BARDS ANNOUNCE NEW MAIL ROUTE<br><br>FIRIONA VIE, Kunark.  February 1, 3178--<br><br>Today, the League of Antonican Bards, responsible for maintaining communication across Norrath announced that they have established a mail route to the newly discovered continent of Kunark, located across the ocean, south and east of Antonica. The new route will carry mail from Port Faydwer to the Elven outpost of Firiona Vie, which will serve as main port-of-entry and battle staging grounds for adventurers arriving in the new lands.  <br><br>The outpost of Firiona Vie was established soon after word reached King Tearis Thex, King of Felwithe and leader of the Koada`Dal, that his daughter of the same name had been kidnapped by lizard creatures now known to be named the Iksar.  The King commissioned Galeth Veredeth, once-Lord and High Paladin of Tunare, to establish the outpost on Kunark and return his daughter to him, lest Veredeth's life be forfeited for failure.  "I cannot allow those vile creatures to keep my daughter and only heir to the Koada`Dal throne from fulfilling her destiny," says King Tearis Thex. "Galeth Veredeth had best not fail me."<br><br>A high level source in Neriak confirmed today that the Dark races will not be outdone in the endeavor to acquire new territory and power.  The source said, "We believe that this nonsense about a kidnapped princess is just that.  If the lesser `Dals and their human and stunted playthings think that they can wander the new lands unchecked, they are quite mistaken."<br><br>Many adventures are already beginning the trip to Kunark, a journey that is not without its perils. A human and halfling party was apparently slaughtered upon their arrival after mistakenly boarding a Kunark-destined ship in the Oasis of Marr.  They evidently were not aware that the ship would arrive at a new port, firmly controlled by Neriak and their brutish muscle from Oggok and Grobb.  <br><br>Druidic scouts have reported that there are some strange phenomena present throughout the new lands.  "The land appears to have been ravaged by some viscous magical storms at one time," said one follower of Karana. "Some magics that we have come to count on just do not work."  This phenomenon was apparently noticed to an extreme in the vicinity of a mountain peak rumored to be inhabited by followers of Veeshan.  "Only through divine intervention did I escape that place with my life."<br><br>The League of Antonican Bards' representative in Kunark met with Galeth Veredeth, Governor of the Outpost Firiona Via.  "It is my sincerest hope that many adventures loyal to the King will assist us on our Quest to return the Princess to her home," says Veredeth. "Though the dangers in these new lands are formidable, I have no doubt that many will come, if for nothing else than to reap the spoils." <br><br>					#	#	#<br><br><br>*Kunark Goes Live*<br><br>In case the announcement from the League of Antonican Bards wasn't to your liking, we are very pleased to announce that the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark expansion has been implemented on the live servers.  Adventurers who have installed the expansion and registered their account key may now visit the new lands, exceed level 50, create Iksar characters, and access Kunark-related content in general. <br><br>Here is a short list of some of the new features available to those who have upgraded:<br><br>- Players may now reach level 60!<br>- Over two dozen new zones to explore!<br>- Tons of new quests, items, and spells to complete, acquire, and learn!<br>- All-new creatures and weapons, with new art too!<br><br>There are two minor issue that is known and that we are still in the process of rectifying: Action-based sounds for the Iksar and some other Kunark creatures are still being worked on.  In other words, you might hear a giant mosquito "walk" by you, and your Iksar might sound curiously like a human when he is hit with a sword. In addition, there is some additional work required with a couple of the starting Iksar quests.  This may cause you to reach a point where you cannot proceed further in a quest.  This will not however cause you to turn in items and be denied your reward, so feel free to explore these new quests.  We will be finishing them over the next week.<br><br>We would like to offer special thanks everyone who has been patient over the past couple of weeks while we've readied EverQuest for this awesome event.  It has been quite a challenge for our team to get everything ready for launch, and your support has been instrumental in this process.  We'd also like to thank the beta test team, who in the face of all of the new content managed to keep their thoughts between themselves and the Dev Team, while working to make the game better for everyone.  <br><br>If you ordered Kunark on or before 4/19/2000 and do not receive your Kunark CD by today, we will be posting instructions later today on how to claim the shipping refund as well as the free month of EverQuest promised last week. <br><br>Thank you,<br><br>The EverQuest Team<br><br>April 24th, 6:01am<br>-------------------<br><br>*K-Patch Required*<br><br>All Kunark-enabled players should run the Kunark Patch on the Patch Program control panel prior to attempting to enter Kunark.<br><br>*Manual Supplement*<br><br>The files named everquest_manual.doc and everquest_manual.txt in your EverQuest directory are now obsolete.  Downloaded to you today are two new files, labeled EQROKSupplement.doc (MS-Word '97 Format) and EQROKSupplement.txt (Text Only).  These files are supplements to the manual distributed with the retail version of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark.  For those who upgraded, PDF files of the manual will be placed on the official EverQuest web-site at www.everquest.com. A new patch message will announce their availability.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

As of this writing it is 9:23AM CST.  I just spent thirty minutes running to the docks and Kaladim to discover the newly created Shuttles.  After waiting about five minutes the all the small shuttles took off.  A very cool sight it was seeing the would-be invasion force depart from the known world on such little transports.  <br><br>After sailing around the zone for a while the shuttles stopped and everyone was teleported back to Butchers Block.<br><br>I have had some reports of new (non-beta testers) players being able to create Iksar, but after trying it myself I had no success.  I haven't received word from Verant on when Kunark has officially gone live, but I'll keep you posted.

Firiona Vie, Sionachie, Thubr Axebringer, Sir Jevik Isqual, Al`Kabor,<br>Dreezil Pocketdip, Dagda Icefury, Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever, and<br>Lyirae Oakwynd arrived at the tiny Elven stronghold in the new lands. Tired<br>from their journey, they stepped off of the Maiden's Voyage and began to<br>rest for a few moments.  Galeth Veredeth came to greet them as they were<br>resting. <br><br>Galeth Veredeth shouts  "Lieutenant Thorn! Please do me the honor of taking<br>our friends on a tour of the surrounding area" <br><br>The Lieutenant approached the group and began to lead them out of town.  As<br>they were walking along, the Lieutenant made an effort to point out the<br>creatures and structures to Firiona and her companions.  He informed them<br>that the Iksar are an ancient race. The ruins that lie all about the land<br>show that the Iksar were a great empire whose influence seemed to stretch<br>the length of the continent. 1900 years ago, the Iksar attempted to attack<br>and take control of Faydwer but the navy was wiped out by a terrible storm<br>and they were not successful. Something terrible happened to cause the once<br>great empire to crumble.  None of the local inhabitants of the area seem<br>very friendly with the exception being the Drixies. <br><br>As the party began to walk back, Danak Dhorentath, an Iksar shaman shouted<br>"Visitors! Watch your backs, the Drolvarg are attacking!"  At that moment,<br>four Drolvarg appeared and ambushed the group.  Danak and an Iksar Initiate<br>joined the group in fighting the Drolvarg. After the Drolvarg were dead,<br>Danak asked if everyone was alright. <br><br>While Firiona was explaining to Danak that they were seeking out the Ring<br>of Scale, he seemed generally concerned for their safety.  He told them<br>that their journey would be incredibly long and dangerous. Danak offered a<br>quicker means for them to get there.  He offered the use of his special<br>portal.  Within a few moments, with serpentine speed, Danak Dhorentath<br>grabbed Firiona Vie by the arm. Taking her by surprise he pulled her into<br>the gate, which disappeared with a hiss leaving nothing more than the smell<br>of ozone hanging in the air. <br><br> "I must return and tell King Thex the terrible news. Bind the vile Iksar<br>at once! Dagda, Thubr, Jevik and I will escort the prisoner back to the<br>mainland!" Galeth Veredeth shouted. <br><br>They escorted the Initiate to the Maiden's Voyage and traveled to Faydwer. <UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen01.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen02.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen03.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen04.jpg">Screenshot #4</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen05.jpg">Screenshot #5</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen06.jpg">Screenshot #6</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen07.jpg">Screenshot #7</a><br><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/FV4screen08.jpg">Screenshot #8</a></UL><br>

A commotion erupts near the warm campfires in the cave leading to Halas. A<br>pair of gnomes scurry out into the cold carrying odd looking equipment.<br>Ognit Eznertob and Dabner Drednever are hurrying to finish setting up a new<br>device they have created while their friend Dagda Icefury gather her<br>kindred to come and experience this life changing revolution. <br>  <br>Dagda Icefury shouts, "Come and see my brothers and sisters!

Gordon Wrinn left a news comment on yesterday's EQVault newspost "More on 2Hand Damage Description."  Here's the thread:<br><UL>I don't know about anyone else but I have not noticed any damage increase per hit. My 13th lev ogre warrior is still hitting for 29 hp max damage. Now maybe what those comments by verant mean is that they increased the frequency of attempts to hit, but that is not clear to me. And if this is so, that the frequency of swings so to speak has been increased it is not noticeable to me. <br><br><b><i>I doubt that you'd notice much at level 13. It's on a curve that increases with level. It will be much more noticable at the higher levels. <br><br>Gordon Wrinn</b></i></UL>Thanks Gordon!
