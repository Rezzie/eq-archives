Alan made a few posts today on the official Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/032418-4.html"><b>Big Thread on Mage Problems</b></a><br>Well, I don't think I'll be able to answer most of these to your satisfaction, but I'm willing to try. I'll tell you now that a post this long is going to be hard to answer, and I don't have all the answers to anyone's problems. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Since the last patch, it has been speculated that the proc rate on sword of runes has decreased.]</i></font> <br><br>I think, by now, you all know the answer to this one. The proc rate on all pet weapons has been reduced to be the same as any player character with the same dexterity. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>It has been speculated that CotH has been altered such that it's chance of clearing aggro has been greatly reduced. It has also been altered so that CoHing a pet caster does not cause his pet to suicide.]</i></font><br><br>Here's what I know. Call of the Hero will probably never always clear the hate list. And we haven't changed anything (that we know of) that reduced the chance that it would clear the hate list. But we have a possible fix ready to be patched that might increase the chance of the hate list being cleared. The same goes for the pet suicide thing, we should have a fix for that in the next patch. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  VELIOUS SPELLS]</i></font><br><br>I'm not discussing Scars of Velious spells. But I'm not going to discourage you from talking about them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Linkdeath. Mages suffer from this more than any other class, since our startup summoning routines (depending upon the situation) can consume anywhere from 2 bubbles to our full mana bar.]</i></font> <br><br>Always been that way, since day one. This is one of the drawback of magehood. We just can't program around accidental link death, we can't tell it from purposeful linkdeath. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Post-50 pet upgrades.]</i></font><br><br>Well, this one baffles me a bit. I, frankly, don't know enough about high level pets. All I can tell you is that I'll look at it and ask questions. But, by way of warning, understand that nobody was promised that they would become super powerful post-50&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Post-50 fire pet.]</i></font><br><br>Again, I dunno. I'll look at it, with the same caveat as the last one. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Deafening Decoy. This pet is not a decoy. Its taunt is ineffective.]</i></font> <br><br>This one is new to me. You should explain this in depth, especially if you want this to be the defining thread on the mage class. I understood the previous two because I had read them elsewhere, but this one is out of left-field for me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  they begin to hit the pet's controller THROUGH the mob, regardless of distance. These hits seem to be based on the controller's AC (all I know is that I am always hit for full). Please fix this bug, Verant, so that I can get rid of my eboots =) Maybe then we can look at the Decoy.]</i></font><br><br>I thought this bug was fixed. It's been a while since I've seen it. I'll ask about it. If you can tell me how to reproduce this bug, we'll gladly find it and squash it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Post-50 spells in general. Mage summons are largely junk. Our spell lines see only minor upgrades in RoK, certainly not in keeping with mob increases.]</i></font><br><br>Well, one man's junk&#8230; <br><br>But if I were to run out and stealth add some interesting but not powerful summons for you, would that be enough? Summons have never really been intended to add to the power of the class, only to its utility (with some notable exceptions). New summons would fall along the same lines. Again, I can't talk about Scars of Velious spells. But I will keep this request in mind if/when we start to look at new spells for magicians. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Mages have no defensive spells: no root, snare, sow, harmshield, shadowstep, crowd control, etc. We are, in effect, the most limited casting class in the game. ]</i></font><br><br>My Take:<br>So what? I am fine in my role, and so long as I am not crippled in my offensive capabilities, I could care less about defense. It's called a drawback, and all classes should have them. What causes people to clamor for these abilities is that our offensive capabilities suffer post-50. Fix our pets and summons in the late game and these complaints will fade away.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok. Because it's highly unlikely that magicians will get things like snare, root or sow. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Mages have minimal group utility. <br><br>My Take:<br>A Mage's major contribution to a group is his pure offensive power. That power has decreased relative to other classes post-50, certainly; however, Mages remain powerful, and I think that the majority of problems that Mages face in groups are because other players do not recognize this. There are legitimate problems: zones where pets are unwanted, for instance, and against Uber Mobs, where Mages are wholly ineffectual. I personally would like to see some group-specific capabilities given to Mages, in return for our soloing ability being crippled post-50. However, this is not a huge priority, and could easily be fixed by addressing the issues with our late game pets and summons. CotH was a good start. (Thanks, Verant.)]</i></font><br><br>You're now getting into seriously overlapping your requests. This, again, seems like a request to up the power of your post 50 pets and your summons and these complaints will fade away. Let's not dilute the discussion by adding things that you don't really need. And you are telling me here that magicians are very powerful pre-50 and acceptably powerful post 50, but that other players just don't know this. Part of the problem with your initial post was: IT'S TOO DARN LONG (and, therefore so is my response). You've included a lot of info, and that's great. But you're asking me to read and comprehend four pages (when pasted into Word) of magician specific stuff, some of which are repeated requests for the same thing&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Mage-specific loot in RoK is sparse, and what does exist is fairly subpar, compared to both existing Mage gear and what other classes get.]</i></font> <br><br>Again, I dunno. I'll take your word for it. I also can't tell you what is or is not in Velious. How about we hold off until we see if this is addressed in Velious? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>The Mage epic quest requires clearing the 7th island of sky. <br><br>My Take:<br>I disagree that this is a problem. These quests were intended to be completed by guilds, not individuals. The difficulty of epic quests is not determined by the difficulty of the mobs involved. That is, in fact, irrelevant (provided that they are killable). It is determined by access to the mobs and the frequency of the drops.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, so we can take this one off the list, since I agree with you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>We require a rare drop off a roaming mid-level rare spawn in a fairly low-level zone.

Abashi stopped by the Gameplay Board today to make <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034160.html">the following announcement</a>:<UL><I>Some people have been reporting that their screen freezes every so often while in game, causing all sorts of mischief. While we are looking into that problem, and do have some changes planned for the next patch that should reduce its occurance, there are some things that you can do first to see if it improves:<br><br>1. Virus scan software: These problems usually run in a systray (down by the clock). By default, they typically are set to scan files every time they are accessed. This could be causing some of those problems, as EverQuest accesses several local files at every character save. Try disabling it to see if your situation improves.<br><br>2. IRQs. PCI devices are designed so that they can share IRQs. That works well in principle, but can cause problems when several high bus-bandwidth devices are on the same IRQ. Typically we've seen this when sound and video cards are on the same IRQ. You can try disabling your sound by placing a file called "NOSOUND.TXT" (file contents do not matter) in your EverQuest directory. If your freezing goes away, there is a good chance it's a shared IRQ problem. The method by which to reassign IRQs varies from system to system, but can be done by either moving the sound card to a different slot, manually assigning IRQs in the BIOS, or manually assigning them in the Device Manager. You probably shouldn't attempt any of these without the assistance of your local computer guru, unless of course you are the local guru.<br><br>As mentioned above, we are putting in some changes in next week's patch that should help the situation for those that aren't affected by #1 or #2, but you'll want to make sure that the problems above are not the cause of your problems before counting on the patch to fix it.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

The following are the latest posts from Gordon Wrinn:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034029.html"><b>Experience Ressurections</b></a><br>There's really no way to determine with any certainty that something of this nature occurred. While I realize that some say that everyone's word should be taken for it, I'm sure everyone will agree that this would be taken advantage of to an extreme, which would prevent the GM staff from doing the other parts of their job. <br><br>One thing to remember is that any reimbursement of any kind for any reason is a service provided by us as a way to try and take care of our customers when they've run into a problem. It's not an entitlement, but is indicative of our desire to see that everyone remains unaffected by problems. The vast majority of resurrections that are given are for things that we have no control over, and are just helping out in the interest of providing good customer service. <br><br>To my knowledge, this service isn't provided by any other game operator out there, so it does surprise me a little when people discount our customer service. <br>--<br>Well, we all love to make someone's week, but I can see the petitions and complaints already: <br><br>"When will the rez train be by?"<br>"My friend got rezed and my corpse was right next to his but I didn't???"<br>"GM Soandso only rezes uberguild members. Not fair!"<br>"GM Soandso only rezes you if you're not in a guild. Not fair!"<br>"VI! Why is there no consistancy in the RandomRez(tm) program?!" <br><br>I really don't think that it would be appropriate to increase people's dependency on the GM staff. That's why they don't perform services that can be performed by PCs, aside from odd verified bug death and removing the occasional corpse from the wall.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034014.html"><b>On "No Drop" Item Suggestion</b></a><br>Well we won't make it so that it can't be looted, as people might not want the zones swarming with ungrouped people looking to pick up the scraps. We are however considering putting in a confirmation box that pops up in the event you try to loot a NODROP item that you cannot use.</UL>

Speaking of pets, Alan <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034001.html">added this announcement</a> to the Gameplay Board tonight:<UL><i>A while back magician pets were given the ability to wield weapons. This was a workaround for the fact that these pets were unable to duel-wield properly. <br><br>After the next patch, pets summoned using necromancer or magician spells of 39th level or higher should duel wield, even without weapons. This will also include the shadownight pets that are the same as necromancer pets of 39th level or better. So these pets will be duel wielding properly henceforth.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>Here's a follow-up from Gordon<UL><i>Just one clarification, the "auto dual wield" ability is based upon a calculation of both the dual wield skill and the level of the pet. So, it is possible that you could get good summon at 34th that auto dual wields without weapons, or a bad summon at 39th that doesn't.<br><br>As a note, no change is being made to their likelihood to dual wield. The change is only going to remove the requirement of handing your pet weapons to get them to dual wield at the higher levels.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>One last post from Gordon:<UL>We were told this was impossible on Jan 28. We were told that this would be impossible to code around.<br><br><b><i>Well, it was impossible on January 28th, as the game engine didn't distinguish between pets and other NPCs.</b></i><br><br>Please explain what changed. <br><br><b><i>A good deal of reengineering was done prior to Kunark's launch to create the 59th necro summon that dual-wields without weapons. Additional code was put in as part of the last patch to further differentiate between pets and other NPCs for the proc changes. <br><br>Given these changes I figured that it would be a good time to address a minor annoyance.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Pets continue to be a dominate issue on the boards.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033978.html">first post in a brand new thread</a> created by Gordon:<UL><I>I would have posted this in the other thread but figured that it was different enough to deserve its own thread for discussion:<br><br>I was just sitting here thinking over the latest issue with pet procing, and the sword of runes, and I noticed something. <br><br>A number of the complaints in this thread cite changing something that's been that way since release, or saying that if we are going to nerf something, why don't we fix something before we nerf something else.<br><br>In truth, we did. Mages only got the ability to hand weapons to their pets 10 months ago (January 28th to be precise). The problem with the procs going off on everything and going off so often only became an issue then. Sure, there was the odd necro who had a magician friend who would summon up weapons, but it certainly wasn't wide-spread enough to make a global difference.<br><br>Your pets are more powerful now than they were at release, even given the latest change. They dual wield now. Sure, that was a bug workaround, but the pets were bumped up in power several times before the dual wield workaround because they weren't beating necro pets. In many ways, they became overpowered when they suddenly began dual wielding, an imbalance that wasn't addressed until now. <br><br>So, as you see, we did address a problem that resulted in increasing the power of the pet prior to "nerfing" a small portion of it. Now I do wish that there had been less time between cause and effect, but it's too late for that at this point. The point is that this is not an ability that has been around forever. While I agree that many people might have come to take it for granted, mage pets are still stronger than they were for nearly a year after release.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

It's the number of people that counts. <br><br>Finally, no one is entitled to the items. We don't expect that everyone will get them. The specific intent is that they not be acquirable by everyone. Items that are meant to be gotten by everyone are far more common in game. The rarity is purposeful.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033821.html"><b>Nerfs</b></a><br>Very well-explained lordiezu, I probably couldn't do a better job of explaining it if I tried, so I'll leave this thread with your response.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033909.html"><b>Stop Changing Things!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Please Verant, stop changing things that have been that way for a long time!]</i></font> <br><br>I've actually seen a number of requests along these lines, but at the same time, a number of complaints about issues that have "been that way for a long time". <br><br>Is there a middle ground? I don't know. Obviously many would prefer that we only address the complaints and leave the things that no one complains about alone, but at the same time, that couldn't be done while maintaining balance. It's a bit of a catch-22.<br>--<br>Oh, as for the rest of the post, I really don't see a correlation between your ability to roleplay your class and the latest changes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033976.html"><b>Damage Increasing Items</b></a><br>Right. Clarity, mod rods, manaconversion spells or items, and other things along that line serve that purpose. <br><br>Haste sashes for melee give an indirect increase to damage. You swing more, and as such you hit more per period of time and thus do more damage. What the original author suggests is something that directly raises the amount of damage done, but that would be more comparable to new weapons for melee, or new spells for casters.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033481.html"><b>Mage Epic Weapon Quest</b></a><br>I somehow doubt it will remain "unsolved" because of these two items. I believe both have been in game for over a year at this point, and it's reasonable to assume that at some point a mage has gotten both items. <br><br>Right now the bottleneck appears to be the other two items. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033671.html"><b>GM Abuse Stories</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why do Absor and Abishi never respond to these GM abuse stories?]</i></font> <br><br>Well "never" is a bit of an exaggeration, however, hardly anything is ever as "black and white" as it's made to seem in the "GM Abuse" threads. Most of them consist of some player interaction issue where the GM was summoned mid-incident and required to make a decision. The person who the decision went against usually ends up on the board and posts a very clear-cut story explaining why the GM was wrong. <br><br>In all truth, if it *really were* that clear-cut, it is not likely that the GM would have made the wrong decision. <br><br>In any case, responding to these issues in cases where the true happenings is anything less than black or white isn't fruitful. We only have one side of a three-sided story posted in most cases, and one of those sides is not likely to come to the board and post theirs. So there's really no point in arguing it. <br><br>Reports of GM misconduct are forwarded to the customer service management team. In cases where the true story cannot be determined with any certainty, a note is made for the GMs file. Misconduct, when it occurs, is hardly isolated to a single instance, and if a GM shows a pattern it can them be necessary that we go further. <br><br>The same is true for players. It's very easy for someone to be falsely accused once, being falsely accused of the same thing in a half a dozen different instances is another thing entirely. <br><br>Anyway, this board is not the proper place to voice complaints about GMs. It tends to reduce the credability of the complaint as it's being made in a public forum for the purpose of garnering public support. If you wish to report something to the CS team concerning GM misconduct, feel free to email gscotto@station.sony.com directly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033752.html"><b>Contiually Making EQ Harder</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Are we too good? IE: why must the game be constantly made more difficult!]</i></font> <br><br>Well first, you are good. Players have consistantly discovered ways to do things that amaze us to this day. It's therefore essential that we keep raising the bar to provide challenge to those that have figured out how to overcome previous challenges. Obviously, we don't intend to make unbeatable encounters, though we could rarely do that when we tried, but we still need to provide a challenge. <br><br>There's actually two issues here. One, making new content more difficult, which I think should be expected by everyone, as what would be the point if things did not get more difficult as you progressed. <br><br>The other issue is making old content more difficult by reducing the effectivness of tactics that allow a challenge to be overcome without risk. This is a different issue entirely, as some people apparently don't expect this. Here's the short of our intentions: You play the game to have fun. You have fun by overcoming challenges. A challenge is something that has the prospect of failure. Failure must have consequences to be meaningful. Overcoming the challenge without failure yields a reward, whether tangible or ideological. Basically, discovering a way to do something without risk (or with less risk than intended) negates the challenge and creates a situation that we must address in order for the game to be fun.</UL>

Alan stopped by the Gameplay Boards during the holiday break and had the following to say:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033524-2.html"><b>Recent Pet Changes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "I think the thing that bears remembering is that to accomplish the SoR nerf, which mages in general realize is necessary, they also nerfed pet dexterity, which they acknowledged and are "looking into" scaling by level. Not only does this affect the procs of all weapons, but it also affects the pet's ability to hit monsters. I think all mages would be quiet if they just removed the proc from the sword of runes rather than nerfing the pets dexterity."]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, don't remember that. It's not true. <br><br>The ONLY thing that was changed was the artificial increase that pets had to their proc rate.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033899.html"><b>Enchanters and Illusions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Absor your comments please on any of the above." ]</i></font><br><br>Well, here are my thoughts on this: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) It might be a false entry in the sp.dat file, however, Necro's get to become Spectres with a new SoV spell at level 60. Regardless of Level, Enchanter's asked for this spell and we're LIED to be Abashi. He said that it could not be implemented because of "global" memory or some lame ass excuse...THEN Necro's get the ability to summon a Spectre Pet. Regardless of how effective the pet is or is not...We were lied to." ]</i></font><br><br>You and I obviously have different definitions of the word LIED. As I explained in another post, we've improved out technology. Were we could not add more things to the global memory before, we have more room now. You were not lied to. I'm not going to comment on any Scars of Velious spells, real or imagined. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) WHY would you add a "attack power" stat buff to any of our Self Illusions. Abashi STATED numerous times that Enchanter's are not meant to melee and yet they give us Illusion Spirt Wolf (which should have a SoW effect) but instead only gives us Attack Power? Same thing with Illusion Werewolf. " ]</i></font><br><br>Here we can have an interesting discussion about what an 'illusion' is. If it were me making the spells, there would be no effect to an illusion beyond the visual effect. After all, an illusion is just a change of perceptions, not a manifestation of anything real. So, in that way, you're right, I don't think there should be a stat buff on any of the illusions at all. <br><br>But, with the EverQuest definition of Illusion, the spell can incorporate the other powers of the Enchanter, as long as it follows the look and feel of the illusion. There must be some link between the power of the enchanter and the form of the illusion. Enchanters don't have the power to increase foot speed, so there is no way they could move as fast as a wolf with that spell. Besides, keep in mind that we don't want enchanters to cast Spirit of the Wolf. So a strength buff makes some sense, considering the form involved. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) Now Illusion Werewolf (self only) gives us a "haste" effect making us attack faster. Yet the new SoV Group Illusion Werewolf gives a chincy 50 mana? Granted that might not be correct but please rethink this." ]</i></font><br><br>Again, I'm not going to discuss any Scars of Velious spells. <br><br>As for not getting any illusions past level 44, I don't know. I don't know why there are no enchanter illusions past 44. But being a master of illusions doesn't really require it. Enchanters ARE the masters of illusions, and you really can't argue that they aren't. <br><br>Should there be post 44 illusions? Maybe. I can't see why not. And I'll keep it in mind to ask someone about it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033921.html"><b>Barbarian Bards?</b></a><br>There are a lot of class/race combinations that would make sense in EverQuest. But at some point we had to draw a line, so that there would be some race and class diversity. <br><br>Sure, Barbarian bards make sense. So do Dwarven bards (Dwarves are an old race, very interested in their own lore), or Gnomish shadowknights&#8230; this could go on until all races had every class. There just has to be a line somewhere&#8230;</UL>

Gordon was not wrong to suggest that people check that. And sharing IRQs can certainly cause trouble with EverQuest. <br><br>I have, however, just learned that there might be a problem with the way the game saves character information. If you are seeing brief pauses that happen when the character is saved (like when you loot, buy things, sell things, change settings&#8230;), this might be our fault. We are looking into it, and hope to have it fixed soon. <br><br>However, if you are getting booted from the game at random intervals, or if you are getting freezing at times other than character saves, you should make sure that your virus scanner is off, and that you are not sharing IRQs. <br><br>Keep in mind that we are posting here not just for the one person that we reply to.

Alan made an important announcement regarding pets tonight on the Gameplay Board.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033226.html">the complete post</a>:<UL><i>Alright everyone, here's what happened.<br><br>As all weapon-wielding pet users probably knew, up until recently pets would proc weapon effects much more frequently than player characters. We recently changed this so that they now proc effects with just about the same frequency as player characters with the same dexterity. The exception is targeted (meant for only one type of enemy, such as summoned creatures) effects, which will now proc about half as often as they do for player characters, but will still proc on anything (this, as you know, is a bug).<br><br>Shortly we will be fixing this bug so that pets with targeted proc items will only proc on the appropriate target. At that time, we will bump up the proc rate to match those of any other weapon proc for the pet.<br><br>This only effects weapon procs, not innate procs.<br><br>No pet attributes were changed.<br><br>All pets currently have the same dexterity. It is possible in the future that we will modify the dexterity of pets based on level and type to make them more flexible for their masters.<br><br>I'm sorry that we didn't mention this change earlier.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>Here's a follow-up from Gordon:<UL>Why didn't you boost the proc rate on PCs instead? Oh wait, I'm thinking of a VI that doesn't exist. Nice to see Absor is essentially a second account for a nicer Abashi to post in.<br><br><b><i>Because the proc rate on PCs is appropriate given that PCs can seek to buff up their own dexterity. Pets all have pretty low dexterity, which we'll probably scale up in the near future given this change. <br><br>A pet with maxed out dexterity will proc nearly as much as it used to.</b></i><br><br>Didnt Abashi PROMISE he would post ANY and ALL nerfs in the server patch message????<br><br><b><i>Indeed, of course mistakes do happen and things fall out of the loop. Given the difference in old procs versus new ones, it would be unreasonable to assume that we were trying to slip this one in, don't you think? In any case, the namecalling you engaged in in the latter part of your message wasn't called for. Please don't engage in it again.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Some might run half way across the zone to pick up something on the ground. Afterall, wouldn't you expect the same of a player? It adds a touch of realism to the world. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033516.html"><b>Epic Weapons Hurting SoV?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you have your FA weapon and full Kunark<br>armor (or caster equivalent) ...er whats<br>the point of going to velious?]</i></font> <br><br>Exploration?

I also think people will be amazed at what is available to them in regards to customizing their appearance.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033523.html"><b>Magician Issues</b></a><br>It looks like half the threads on the first page are about mage issues of one kind or another. Let me see if I can clear up a few of the rumors going around, and please try to keep the number of threads down. <br><br>Though it might seem that this many threads are necessary to properly express the feelings that some are having, all that will happen is that we'll have to start closing threads. <br><br>Call of the Hero: No intentional change was made to the way that this works. However, there were some changes made to the way intra-zone teleports are handled (to actually make them work better), so it is possible that it might have had an unintended effect on Call of the Hero. <br><br>Pets: No changes were made to pet stats. The only change that was made in regard to pets is that they now proc all-target procs as if they were a player character. They proc special-target procs half as often as if they were a player. The next patch will make it so that special-target procs are proced just as often as the others, but will only work on the intended target type. <br><br>This change does NOT affect what we call a "contact innate" (e.g. A spell that procs directly off of an NPC such as the necro lifetap procs on 44th and 49th) or "spell innate" (casted spells such as that done by mage pets). <br><br>We will MOST LIKELY be scaling the dexterity of pets with their level so that the higher level ones will proc carried weapons more often, nearly as much so as before. We will also look into creating new summoned special-target proc weapons for mages. <br><br>All of the other things that we should have fixed instead: Every time we make a change considered negative to a particular class, the boards are filled with complaints that we should have fixed something else instead of spending time on this. While I appreciate everyone's thoughts, we're not going to exclusively stick to making changes that everyone will like at the expense of the overall detrement to the game. To use an analogy (which you all know I like to use), complaining that the officer should be out catching real criminals instead of writing you up for speeding is not going to make him say, "You're right", and stop writing your ticket. There are things that need to be done. Things that upset the balance of the game (typically by making it too easy thus trivializing aspects of it by removing the challenge) will get priority over other things that don't have this type of impact. It's the way it works and the way we need to do things to keep the game interesting.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033242.html"><b>Patch problems</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why, by the way, has this problem suddenly erupted with the patch? I was running DirectX 7.0 in combination with EQ fine before the patch.]</i></font> <br><br>It's not only the version of DX running on the client machine, but the version that the client's code was compiled under. Previously, the EQ client was compiled under something in the 5.x range. This earlier version of DX was far less system-friendly than the current version, and didn't like to give up much processing time to other applications. The new version of directx allows the operating system to handle the majority of that. <br><br>As for you still having a problem, if you could post your DXDIAG information, I'll be happy to have the tech guys take a look.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/032816.html"><b>Faction Hit For No Reason</b></a><br>They don't happen for "no reason". What happens is that somehow you ended up on the hatelist of the NPC before it died. This can happen by aiding someone on the hate list or by ending up on the hatelist of another NPC within range of the NPC in question. For instance, if an NPC casts an AoE spell that catches you just because you happen to be standing there, you are then on the hatelist of the NPC who cast the spell.</UL>

Andrew Park informed me that GameSpot is featuring EverQuest as their <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/features/0,12059,2655176,00.html">Online RPG of the Week</a>.  The first few pages of the article contain a write-up of EverQuest's history followed by a Q&A session with Verant's Jeff Butler.  Here's a clip:<UL><b>GS: Thanks for taking the time for this interview. EverQuest has been a remarkably successful game, and it's changed a great deal since its initial release. Would you say that the game is more or less where it should be in terms of development? What's the best change that's been implemented since its release? </b><br><br>JB: I continue to be pleased with EverQuest as it matures, and I am fairly satisfied with the game at this stage. That said, we look forward to refining and adding to the game in the future. <br><br>In my opinion the best change since release was the implementation of randomized spawns and loot drops for the Kunark expansion. </UL>To read the rest, use the link provided in the above.

Details are still sketchy, but it appears that late last night a rogue EverQuest Guide, now most likely an ex-guide, summoned several players to Veeshan's Peak, cast a bind spell on them, and watched them die over and over again at the hands of Veeshan's Peak NPCs.<br><br>Afterwards, the guide responsible sent out a letter about his or her activities.  This site received a copy from the ex-guide him/herself:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hello!<br><br>Just thought I'd let you have this since you might like it. I was an EQ <br>Guide on the Terris Thule server. Last night (Nov 20, 2000) around 10:30pm <br>PST I decided to summon around 20 players to Veeshans Peak and bind them <br>there causing them to die many many times. For the players I didn't get a <br>chance to bind, I continued to summon them over and over until some big <br>nasty GM got mad at me, at which time my internet connection became very <br>unstable and disconnected me *shrug*. Included are some screenshots of the <br>nice event. For those of you Terris players whom I didn't get a chance to <br>bind: Sorry I will do better next time.<br><br>Take care!<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/guide01.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/guide02.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/guide03.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/guide04.jpg">Screenshot #4</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/guide05.jpg">Screenshot #5</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/guide06.jpg">Screenshot #6</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/guide07.jpg">Screenshot #7</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/guide08.jpg">Screenshot #8</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>It's pretty clear and evident just from the letter that this guy completely lost it.  <br><br>Here's another report of this as sent to me by Coladar:<BLOCKQUOTE>As some might have heard, last night at 2am eastern time, a rogue guide <br>started to summon and bind nearly 20 people in Veeshan's Peak on Terris <br>Thule. The guide summoned anyone that was not anon/role above 57, in any <br>guild or unguilded. Those who were not bound were summoned multiple times.<br><br>After nearly an hour multiple GMs arrived, ressed those that died one by <br>one, and summoned us to South Ro after we looted. We were then summoned to <br>Arena, given a restore of some sort, and told "Have a nice day!" Sadly all <br>of us lost multiple pixels after the restore, so the situation is far from <br>resolved. It is unknown why the guide did this, as they were fairly unknown <br>on the server. They sent out a taunt during one of my trips, not targeted <br>at anyone.<br><br>There has been no official statement from Verant yet, but I am sure this <br>story will continue to unfold. Images I managed to take can be found at: <br><br><a href="http://www.swtoys.net/VP1.jpg">http://www.swtoys.net/VP1.jpg</a> <br><a href="http://www.swtoys.net/VP5.jpg">http://www.swtoys.net/VP5.jpg</a> <br><a href="http://www.swtoys.net/VP6.jpg">http://www.swtoys.net/VP6.jpg</a><br><br>Coladar Shirlmanson<br>Warrior of the 57th Blade<br>Terris-Thule</BLOCKQUOTE>I was hoping to get a comment from Verant before running this post, but several hours have gone by since I sent the request and have received no response.<br><br>Please also don't believe this one individual represents the whole of the Guide community.  While this was a horrible event for many players, the bulk of the guides are dedicated people.  Let's hope this person doesn't force Verant to tighten the rules the Guides are already bound by.
