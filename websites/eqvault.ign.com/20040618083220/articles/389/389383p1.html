<span class=dateline>March     03, 1999</span> - Hailhail!
Recently there was an article written for the EverQuest Express, Issue #26, entitled "EverQuest vs. Asheron's Call." (http://eqx.simplenet.com/Issue26/e33.htm) written by "Wynn Orill." Granted the author admitted that the article was a "crap shoot" because neither Asheron's Call nor EverQuest had entered beta yet. However, this does not mean that ignorance of information released by either company about their software should be acceptable in a thorough analysis. Reading through the article, though, I notice many misconceptions about Turbine's Asheron's Call, which point out that pre-beta information about that game was not thoroughly researched and its significance was not properly thought out. I cannot understand the intent of an article with such an oversight, yet I will say one thing, the author's description of his article as a "crap shoot" was at least half right.
GRAPHICAL EXPERIENCE
Most issues are not solid black and white, but have many shades of grey in between. Therefore, if an answer is restricted to a yes/no, right/wrong, or better/worse answer, then the chances for informative results are decreased. Such is the case in the answer of whether Asheron's Call or Everquest will have a superior graphical experience. The released screenshots of those games both show admirable artistry, the terrain textures in Asheron's Call are exquisite, and Everquest's skins look quite realistic. However, if we want to look at the overall issue of the Graphical Experience offered by either online game, we might run into some difficulty.
The first and most important difficulty stems from the fact that neither Everquest nor Asheron's Call has reached even the beta testing stage. Without being able to view the advances that they will undoubtedly make in graphics, and gauge which of them in the final analysis comes out ahead, any conclusions may be extremely inaccurate.
The next difficulty occurs when we grasp that graphical performance is made up not only of the polygons displayed, textures, resolution, etc., but also of with what efficiency those pleasing images are displayed. The fact that one game, EverQuest, recommends a 3D accelerator to help it display its graphics speedily may seem a good point, yet if we think of previous experiences with almost any online game, we wonder how hefty graphics will be supported by not-so-powerful PC's. The issue is even more confused when we learn that Turbine intends to eventually add 3D accelerator support for Asheron's Call, which has been said to have an advantage in polygon count. Which engine will provide the better picture, at the better speed, therefore, is still a completely unresolved issue.
In a final graphical analysis, the answer may lie somewhere in the shades of grey, somewhere deep in the thousands of shades of grey both games will tastefully display. How many customers will be able to pay for a graphics accelerator to see those shades of grey, and how many will not, is also quite undetermined at this time.
Advantage: Unknown
INTERFACE
There is even less that can be presumed about the Interface of both games than can be supposed of their Graphics. The current shortcomings of the EverQuest interface, as listed by Wynn Orill, may very well be quickly corrected by Sony before its release. After those shortsights, however, Wynn goes on to mention that Asheron's Call's skill interface "is a lot easier to use" than that of EverQuest. He later calls the movement system of Asheron's Call "cumbersome," yet admits that most will find it easy to utilize. Wynn, however, misses the fact that Asheron's Call will include numerical hotkeys, similar to EverQuest's. Not noting much about the interface of either game at this time, however, I am inclined to agree with Wynn's conclusion.
Advantage: Asheron's Call
COMBAT
When many gamers contemplate the joys of RPGing, quite a few of them will place Combat high on their list. Consequently, an RPG must have an enjoyable physical combat sytem to attract gamers.
The system in EverQuest, according to developers, is one almost solely determined by a character's stats. There is not much to say about this, just click on your opponent and let the automated combat handle itself, with the occasional kick and punch thrown in. In the end, your stats will be calculated against your enemy's complete stats (armor/weapon/physical/etc.), and the character endowed with higher stats will win. In Asheron's Call, though stats play a large part, a character must also have knowledge of HOW to fight. The trade-off speed for power and accuracy is a skill undoubtedly gained by only by practice and intelligence, and knowing where to hit on any given opponent will be in the store of combat knowledge of the experienced warrior. This system undoubtedly make combat much more interesting, allowing characters to even further personalize their characters, and making PvP and PvM combat something more engaging than just clicking a creature and "hoping." In Asheron's Call, a character can actually take steps to affect the outcome of combat, apart from the stat calculations. Wynn Orill claims "a little lag will destroy the whole thing." The designers of Asheron's Call, however, have different objectives for their game. 
The following is a quote from those designers:
"You select a target you wish to engage in combat, then the AI takes over and goes after him, to an extent. You say when and who to attack, and the server fills in the details. We also have a system that allows you to choose from a variety of combat moves and where you hit your target, it's pretty cool."
From this information, it is obvious that lag will not affect the combat system of Asheron's Call. Your character will continue attacking in the way you specified with lag or without. Also, I wouldn't be surprised to find a character able to set "combat options," when lag does strike, or for other measures against lag to be in place.
The medal for Valour and Entertainment in Combat therefore, for their innovative and interesting online physical combat interface, goes to Turbine Games' Asheron's Call.
Advantage: Asheron's Call
MAGIC
Possibly the most complicated and interesting feature of any RPG is its magic system. Complex, yet simple, convoluted, yet intriguing, the system must be one which aids in roleplay of these intelligent and devoted people, these mages. Asheron's Call and EverQuest both attempt to accomplish this feat.
The system for EverQuest contains many elements of classic RPG's. Choose to be one of the many magical classes, Wizard, Enchanter, Necromancer, Magician and Shaman, and and then seek out the spells of that class. Each class seems to be well balanced and unique (Wizard with the strongest attack spells AND Teleportation spells may be a bit too much, though), and the developers claim that no spell "repeats" itself over classes.
The Asheron's Call system, though little has been released at this point, appears to be more complicated. Being a mage in Asheron's Call, aside from practicing the skills needed, involves learning the "language" of magic. This language consists of Words of Power, Reagents, and Gestures. There will be the equivalent of adjectives, verbs, nouns, etc., and the better you learn to "speak" the language, the better you will be able to cast spells. The aim is that eventually, if people are good enough, they will be able to create spells virtually "on the fly." To help prevent people from mass circulating combinations which create spells, when too many people use a spell, then it weakens in strength. Therefore, people will be encouraged to hoard their spells, and when it does get posted, then the craft of a mage will still require talent, for people must experiment to find out which spells remain strong. The spells themselves are divided into four schools and a few that do not belong to schools.
To sum up the magic systems, EverQuest's is simple yet interesting, and Asheron's Call's is more complicated but addictive, both have their merits. The idea of being a dark Necromancer in EverQuest is quite captivating, summoning the dead from the earth to protect one from warriors, and from other fireball throwing mages, and likewise, the other classes seem interesting to roleplay, yet it may eventually become quite boring. Asheron's Call will be a challenge to learn. As the player learns the language of magic, the character's abilities as a master mage increase to reflect that knowledge, often personalizing the mage beyond expectations.
Which is better? To compare the two would be like comparing apples and oranges, and not appropriate. Both are high quality efforts, and the decision will finally be left up to the Mage...
Advantage: Unknown
GAME WORLD
Similar to their handling of the magic issue, Turbine and Sony have adopted extremely disparate approaches to the Game World and the immersion in it.
Once again, Sony has adopted the classical approach using familiar creatures such as dragons, orcs, skeletons, etc. They also have a detailed background history of a few thousand years as well as a detailed "deity-system." In an unique twist, Sony has allowed players to role-play some common "monsters," such as Ogres and Trolls as well as the usual Human, Elf, Halfling, etc., and some of their own inventions. Sony has also created an "alignment system" which is based on the race played. For instance, the morality of a Troll may be different from that of an Ogre, and the Ogre's very contrary to that of a human. The specifics of the "alignment/title" system are under wraps at this time. The world also includes submerged areas (as opposed to simply underwater), replete with underwater creatures.
Turbine, on the other hand, has kept up their extremely distinct style by creating a world very different from the well known RPG world. Populated by such exotic creatures as the Reedshark and the Olthoi, Turbine's 49,152 x 49,152 meter world is one which will provide many unusual experiences. Instead of allowing the player the usual Human, Dwarf, Elf, etc. races to play, Turbine instead introduces three human heritage groups, the Aluvians, the Gharu'ndim, and the Sho, modeled loosely after Medieval Knights, the Al-Andalus Moors, and Oriental Chinese respectively. Each heritage group is fully supported, with many millions of possibilities of appearance customization for each group available. Furthermore, and very importantly, Turbine has included a system of Allegiance, whereby a character may swear fealty to someone, and that person may swear fealty to another, and so on, the rank of a character being determined by how many "vassals" he has under him and which heritage group he belongs to. Asheron's Call also has a rich background, in this case spanning 4,000 years, yet no religious system is as yet released. Another important feature of the world of Asheron's Call is its scalability. A large land mass can be added with only a few clicks (depending on how much personalization is intended) of a mouse, and the designers continually stress how easy they have made it to add more content.
As this article was written to dispel misinformation spread by Wynn Orill, it is necessary to say that the solely portal access to dungeons he described as existing in Asheron's Call has no basis, and as I have described, it has a rich background story, despite Wynn not hearing about it.
To bring to a close the analysis of both game Worlds, one must conclude that the appeal of the history of either world at this point must be decided by its fans individually. To say one is better than another would be like saying the history of Washington DC is "better" than that of Boston, or the Phillipines is "better" than Indonesia. Their appeal is different, and an objective decision cannot be made with the information we have (and do not have) at this time. As to the immersive quality of either Norrath or Dereth, each game institutes its own original measures, Allegiance System, "Monster" Race Options, Single World, etc. and they are well balanced when judged against one another. Therefore, the decision of which is "best," is also left to players.
Advantage: Unknown
"INTANGIBLES"
Both Sony and Turbine have very talented programmers, artists, and other staff members, and it is misguided to castigate any company for imagined deficiencies. Contrary to what Wynn may think, Turbine writes the client AND server code for Asheron's Call, and Microsoft has little to do with that. However, Wynn's animosity towards Bill Gates may be forgiven, though it would be better be vented elsewhere, not in a supposedly informed article. As to his accusation that Turbine "realizes they have a short term game here, and will be trying to push it out the door before EQ sees the light," I think some quotes from a Turbine source would most approprietly address his confusion:
"The thing about online gaming is that you are trying to build a community - while selling an initial number of "boxes" would be nice, the real point and profitability lies in your long term customers. People form bonds in online games that are just as real as any bond you might form in the real world. It's all about community, and your first impression is often the only one you get. Why make your first impressions essentialy a lie or a failure?"
"... a more important thing is "the elders game". This is the game you play when you've killed all the monsters, and solved all the dungeons. It's the people game - the social aspects of the game that make it last longer than a single player counterpart"
"I think the only reason Turbine, on the whole, has kept a "low profile" is because we are extremely busy... Then there's the problem of "opening up the valve""
As the preceding quotes show, Wynn's comments were wholly inaccurate, and therefore we have little basis to judge the "intangibles" of either company.
Advantage: Intangible
CONCLUSION
The final tally is....
Graphical Experience: Unknown
Interface: Asheron's Call
Combat: Asheron's Call
Magic: Unknown
Game World: Unknown
Intangibles: Intangible 
In conclusion, with an easy to use interface and an interactive, personalizable, combat system, Asheron's Call takes the lead the Interface and Combat Categories. In the category of Graphics, the information we have (screenshots and system requirements) does not fully cover the issue and could very well be mislead us, so the result is unknown. As far as Magic is concerned, Sony has implemented a "Classic" solution while Turbine goes out on a limb with some innovation, and the appeal of either will vary with different individuals. From what we know of the Game Worlds, it seems that both companies have outdone themselves. Sony again sticks with the "Classic" RPG format in their creation of Dereth while Turbine has gone out on a limb with their completely unconventional island of Dereth, yet both seem equally good. In public chats, the design teams seem very enthusiastic and with little else to go on the "Intangible" category cannot be decided. The final result of the tally therefore has Asheron's Call in the lead with two clear "wins." However, as the Unknown categories play so important a part of Role Playing Games, the only fair and impartial OVERALL verdict this analysis could provide would be to say that the superior product is, at this point, unknown.
AUTHOR'S OPINIONS
I hope you enjoyed or learned something from this article, now let me tell you which game I, personally, prefer. Keep in mind that these are only my own preferences, not what is "Right" or "Wrong," but what suits ME, and may not be fact, and so you may not wish to read past this point.
Firstly, the first screenshots I saw of a 3D Online RPG were those of EverQuest, and they rendered me quite speechless. The detail level and realism were fantastic, and I was instantly hooked. Later, because of the less publicity Turbine has produced, I saw Asheron's Call screenshots, and just the skyline was enough to put my heart in my mouth (though the rest is quite admirable too).
When I read through the info's on both games, I discovered the Magic system of Asheron's Call. Very similar to one that I, and I suppose thousands of RPGers around the world, have tried to create in pen'n'paper RPG, it became quite holy to me, especially when the development team clarified what it would be like if you became "fluent" in the language. I wondered, however, why I could not be a Dark Elf Shaman, or High Elf Wizard in the world of Dereth. As I read through the information I found, I discovered the Allegiance system and understood. Living sometimes on the Arab Desert Island nation of Bahrain myself (in real life), the Gharu'ndim, a heritage group modeled after the Al-Andalus Moors, instantly caught my attention. Becoming addicted, I attempted to pry every scrap of information I could from the internet about Asheron's Call, and came across some very shrewd concepts from Turbine.
Dynamic Load Balancing which automatically hands of work from an overburdened server of Asheron's Call to a not so busy one was interesting. The scalability which allowed updates to be made to the game and servers added transparently to the user, and allowed new content to be added quite quickly and easily was also quite amazing. The small amount of data it was necessary to download to travel regions of Dereth were neat. The combat and aforementioned magic system were ideas I had suggested to UO a while back, and I thought they would keep a character personalized and interesting for quite some time. The system of Titles from Allegiance was alluring. Finally, the idea that every single monster and creature the programmers placed on Dereth would be developed, completely originally, by the Turbine team pretty much decided that I would have to buy Asheron's Call. Now don't get me wrong, I may love Asheron's Call, but I also love EverQuest, and have followed both for quite some time. In fact, this decision was so hard for me to make that I ultimately decided I would just have to buy both games. However, when I finally take my first few steps in a 3D online RPG, I suspect I will be walking in Dereth.
In the end, the better Role Playing Game will be decided by which has better Role Playing Gamers, so let's PLAY.<div class=byline>-- <a href="mailto:yu219121@yorku.ca">Sayeed</A></div></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
