<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon was back on the boards in full force today as he responded to several different player-generated posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the lowdown:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065594.html"><b>Wizards Post Locked</b></a><br>We have to shut down threads when they exceed 250 posts. 300 is really the key number but the chance of corruption of the boards goes up quite a bit after that. I didn't realize the thread had already doubled the usual size, so just caught it now. <br><br>There's a good chance that the thread will need to be deleted should it cause problems on the board. I hope not to do that, but just be aware.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065582.html"><b>A Radical Test</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ok, I would like to propose a radical idea. Your dev team will probably hate me for suggesting this, but its one way to maybe get something done about all the problems facing players in EQ. I suggest that Abashi and some of the dev team take the top complaints people are having, wizards, monks, etc..., and give them exactly what they want.]</i></font> <br><br>Just to preface my answer, I'm going to ask everyone to keep an open mind and not take offense at anything here. Most of us have played MMOG's for some time. Whether in the commercial setting, or in the form of MUDs, some of the issues we deal with are not due to any one particular person, but common problems that will be encountered any time someone tries to develop of a game of this nature. <br><br>On to the subject at hand. This would be a radical idea. Let's assume for a moment that we can get those classes to agree on what they want and make the change. Should we decide to "revert back" later, how upset would people be then? Next, lets understand that some other classes would feel slighted by the changes made to these classes. They'd then expect to get what they want. Then other classes that weren't involved in the first two changes would figure that they also deserve what they want. Then we'd be back to the first two classes that feel slighted as it is. This would continue until we put our foot down and said, "No more". <br><br>But we don't need to try that, because it's already been done. Over the past 7 months, tons of positive changes have been made to the classes, with very few negative ones. Any positive change made to one class satisfied them for the time until a few months down the road when all of the other changes were factored in. Several of the loudest complaints I'm hearing now are coming from the same classes that had complaints that we fixed months ago. The feeling of, "It's our turn now", keeps coming around again and again. We're now at the point to put our foot down as mentioned above. <br><br>We can't afford to go making changes that we know will unbalance the game just for the purpose of reducing complaints, when the situation remains that there will always be issues that the players feel need to be addressed. There will always be some inequality felt by some classes, because we've designed the game not for equality but for balance. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065573.html"><b>Key Quest Broken?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why is it that the keys for Sebilis have both halfs of the key on 2 different mobs in the same zone that are always up and always drop each half, YET the keys for Charsis are on 2 different mobs, 2 different zones ( both green to the folks that would be going to charsis) and both mobs DO NOT always have the key componet ?]</i></font> <br><br>Concerning the critters being green, when designing dungeons, even new dungeons, we have to take into account the way that it fits within the entire game. Certainly there are a bunch of high level people who find those creatures green, but the person who is advancing through the game and encounters them while adventuring probably will get some experience off of them. They'll then have these components once they reach level to enter that dungeon. Every time we put in something new, there's always a rush to get it. It takes a little while, but it balances out before long. <br><br>Concerning the difficulty of getting the items, all I can say is that the quests are different. Ones easier, and the other is harder. It's based on whatever the quest designer had in mind at the time. I don't think that we'd be interested in making one easier just because of the other.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065548.html"><b>Why don't SKs get Gate?</b></a><br>Gate is reserved for pure caster/priest classes. Consider "Shadowstep" as an extra ability that they garner from their parent class.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065563.html"><b>Insight</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm just alittle curious when I look and see that clerics get equal AC to Paladins and ShadowKnights plus get complete heal on their Breastplate versus a 45 min, self only lvl 24 necro spell, major sheilding and symbol of pinzan which requires a component. I'm not complaining as I would surely love to have a cleric that can sit back and start casting CH when at half health over and over.]</i></font> <br><br>In this case, the cleric item is giving them access to a spell that they normally have, that just costs them mana. The casting time on the item is sufficient to ensure that it's not exactly a combat heal and doesn't replace the casted heal itself. It's also an extremely rare item off of a really tough creature. The breastplate itself doesn't really expand the definition of what a cleric is. They still remain a healer. I would admit that you'd have a point had we put some type of damage spell on it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What is the reasoning behind having a set bonus applied to weapons. Should the bonus not be adjusted to the damage of the weapon?]</i></font> <br><br>The damage bonus itself was originally put in without any regard to weapons, use, or damage. We later upped the per-swing damage bonus for 2H weapons. These weapons, the 3/10 and 4/11 and other really low delay weapons out there are basically broken. We're still fighting over whether or not to make a retroactive change to them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065538.html"><b>Summoning More Pets</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why can't pet classes summon more than one pet at a time?]</i></font> <br><br>Client (polygons) and server load. A zone currently needs to support X people, Y pets, and Z NPCs. As long Y=X, and Z is constant, the numbers remain manageable under most circumstances. As soon as Y=2X or 3X, it quickly becomes difficult, and the server would have trouble keeping track of them all. <br><br>Additionally, as the number of things in the zone increases, the client then has to draw that many more polygons. <br><br>Pet power was set based upon this one-pet limit. If we allowed multiple pets, their power would drop significantly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065536.html"><b>Death Penalty</b></a><br>Everyone keeps quoting the worst case scenario in regards to the death penalty. You can reduce that substantially by getting a res. Yes, I understand that a res might not always be available, but assuming that you have friends, it's probably available enough that you can mitigate the death penalty to a great extent. Death is supposed to be very inconveniencing and something that you don't want to encounter. It wouldn't be a risk if this weren't the case. <br><br>The experience system in game is considered frozen, meaning that no further changes will be made to how experience is earned, dealt out, or lost.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065512.html"><b>Runaway Pets</b></a><br>Runaway pets in dungeons (though preferrably not due to pathing problems) is one of the designed dangers of using pets. Owners need to be espicially careful that their pet doesn't run off, upset a few critters, and bring them back home to the group.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065524.html"><b>Please Define Companion (Shaman Pet Issue)</b></a><br>As I mentioned in the same message where I made the "companion" comment, the shaman's pet is not core to the ability of the class. Basically, it is intentional that in the end, the SK ends up with the pet that they do, and shaman end up with the pet that they do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065497.html"><b>"HT, LoH, & Posion but not Divine Aura/Barrier?"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Seems to me, if my god renders me invulnerable, I shouldn't be able to be stunned. I mean, I cant cast or attack, and no spell caster can cast on me. No mob can attack me either. Evac is real fun when you are invulnerable. Yet magically, my god doesnt have the power to keep me from being stunned. Hmmm....]</i></font> <br><br>From an in-character perspective, the idea is that just because your skin is impenetrable and your body is uncrushable, you can still be knocked over. From an out-of-character perspective, nothing is supposed to be 100% reliable in all cases. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065274.html"><b>Abashi Does Listen to Wizards</a></b><br>To the original poster, thanks for noticing. It's surprising how fast positive changes are forgotten after they are made.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065483.html"><b>Didn't Get Transfered...</b></a><br>We're referring people who didn't get moved to our customer-service email at <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a>. We'll do what we can to take care of everyone.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064198.html"><b>Pet Comparison</b></a><br>The mage 50+ fire pet (Vocerate:Fire?) isn't a "power" pet, it's a "situational" pet. Mages need to decide under what situations that pet is appropriate, much like many of your other pets. If you cannot see a situation in which that would be a good pet, it's not mandatory that you use it. You have many other pets at your disposal.</UL>

Brad made an interesting post on the Gameplay Board sharing the current subscriber figures with us.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065473.html">the post</a>:<UL><i>Just to follow up on what Abashi said:<br><br>We have 270,000 active subscribers. That number includes those who are being billed and those who are on their free month.<br><br>We have been peaking at about 60,000 players during peak ours. I think that's about 22% of our player base being on during peak hours.<br><br>That's pretty normal. Games like EQ, UO, AC, etc. usually have about 20% to 30% of their player base playing during peak hours, depending on the age of the game (the older the game, the slightly lower the number).<br><br>The 180k responses Gordon was refering to was how many of our customers logged on in one 24 hour period. That's also pretty normal.<br><br>I'm not sure where these other wild numbers came from -- we've always been very up front with our numbers and if you look up old posts from me or Abashi you can see a steady climb over the last 16 months the game's been live.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>

Verant Vice President Brad McQuaid added his two cents on a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065382.html">board thread</a> talking about EverQuest burnout.  Here's his complete post:<UL><I>I wrote a post a while back on MMORPG burn-out -- it's probably still out there somewhere.<br><br>Abashi is correct -- with most games, you start playing and either get hooked or not.<br><br>If not, you shelf it/return it, and move on, perhaps only slightly annoyed that you bought a game you didn't care for.<br><br>If you're hooked, you play it through, complete it, and move on, looking for another good game.<br><br>With an MMORPG you play, and you play, and you keep playing, until you're burned out. Burn out can come from boredom (you've done it all, or done all you care to do), or from aspects of the game that annoy you that you overlooked when it was new but now aggrivate you more and more, etc. <br>Also, there aren't very many choices out there right now, and MMORPGs are forced to try to appeal to as many people as possible. That means there are people playing these games that only like certain aspects of the gameplay. Basically, they choose the MMORPG that most closely matches their disires and tastes and, in a sense, tolerate it. As the market matures, the players mature, the game space expands, etc., players will have more choices. MMORPGs wil be able to be more niche, appealing to more specific groups of customers. This, I think, will help with some of the burnout issues.<br><br>In any case, as MMORPG designers, one of our core challenges is to figure out ways to keep most players entertained over the long haul either indefinitely or at least until we can provide an alternative (sequel, different product, etc.) <br><br>That isn't always possible, though, and so we are at times faced with upset ex-customers who have a bad taste in their mouth even though they've played the game for over a year and logged 100+ days of playing time. <br><br>It's not a new phenomenon, of course. The same stuff happened with MUDs and other similar games that a. have no ending and b. are very compelling. Slowly but surely, people become upset and either quit or keep playing, remaining upset.<br><br>Some of you might say, well that's because these games aren't any good or some such, and that as soon as a truly 'great' MMORPG comes along, there will be no burn out or hard feelings.<br><br>Perhaps. But I doubt it (though I'd love to be wrong). I think any game that can keep a players attention for month after month, even year after year (take a look at UO), is simply a GREAT game. <br>That said, MMORPGs are still first generation. We all have a very bright future ahead of us and I'm sure many design hurdles will be overcome.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>Thanks goes to Loremaster, who incidently just quit EQ, for sending word of Brad's post. :)

Gordon's been busy this past afternoon answering a few posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065382.html"><b>The Feeling When You Quit EQ</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I was thinking about this...<br><br>.. any other game I have played, it's fun, you and your friends enjoy the rush, but eventually, you stop playing. If the game was good (example: Diablo) you are excited about the follow-up game (example: Diablo II)... and you have a pretty good feeling about the the game company that created the game (in this case, Blizzard).<br><br>So why is it that when people quit playing EQ, they are frustrated, angry, upset, etc? No sense of satisfaction, more of a sense of a waste of time. Also, it seems, that most who stop playing EQ have bad feelings about Verant.]</i></font> <br><br>I've given this issue a good deal of thought myself. I think that it is a situation that is unique to massively-multiplayer online games. You see, there's no way to "win" these games. The closest you could come to winning would be to do everything that there is to do, and get everything that there is to get. Since *no one* could ever do that, no one ever gets close to the idea of winning. <br><br>With single player games, there's often a linear storyline with one main plot. There might be a few branches with subplots, but the main idea remains. Completing these games give you a feeling of "wow, that was a good game", but you still put them on the shelf and will probably never play them again. If you finish the game, you are probably still "happy" with the game, or otherwise "satisfied" when you complete it. There's a good chance that you wish there was more game to play. <br><br>MMOGs have to provide all of their content up front, as soon, there will be people at all stages of advancement playing. There can be no main "plot" to the entire purpose of the game, only a bunch of smaller challenges for you to encounter. <br><br>People play MMOGs until they are no longer satisfied with the game, then they quit. Since quitting basically requires boredom of dissatisfaction, people don't remember the game as fondly as they would a single-player game that they've just completed. As game developers, our task is to keep adding things to the game to keep people interested and satisfied. Of course, it takes an author months to write a novel, but only a few hours to read it. <br><br>We're faced with the same dilemma when it comes to adding to the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065444.html"><b>Current Subscriber Base</b></a><br>We're running over 270K active subscribers as of this morning. Roughly 80% of those play in any 48 hour period. When we ran the poll on the dragon issue, I believe it was done on a Wednesday, and we had over 180K responses in the 24 hours that it was up. <br><br>Fridays and Saturdays remain our biggest days for total number of people played.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065473.html"><b>The Truth: Is EQ on a decline?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 270K or 180K is misleading and only reflects the people using the chat login. These numbers have no real connection to people paying for or playing EQ at any given time.

This is every paying account, whether they are currently being billed or whether they are on their free month. <br><br>Don't confuse active accounts with peak usage. Peak usage is only a percentage of active accounts. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065474.html"><b>Gordon's Evil Twin Brothers</b></a><br>There's apparently some hole in station name registration that allows station names to be created that have a space after them.

Money sinks only serve to reduce the amount of money in the world which would cause a further lowering of prices. The existing money sinks, and the reduced cash drops in many areas has done a good job of increasing the value of platinum. <br><br>Prices are also dropping due to the fact that there are more of the items in game, meaning that supply is exceeding demand. It's a bit harder to do something with this, unless we develop an "item sink".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065247.html"><b>Items from the Gods</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why is it that Innoruuk and Cazic worshipers are the ones blessed with the god specific items, doesnt it make at least some semblance of sense to have god specific items for paladins?]</i></font> <br><br>Perhaps those are just the only ones you've heard of. It's also possible that they all aren't in yet. Things of this nature tend not to go in all at once. We typically don't comment on specific quests, so this is about all I can say on the subject.</UL>

I received the following from Ignitz:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings fellow Norrathians of the Tribunal Server. My name is Ignitz <br>Gemcaller, and I am the guildmaster of the Heroes of Valor. It is my distinct <br>pleasure to announce to you today the start of a month long events sweep. <br>That's right, once a week for the entire month of August the HoV will be <br>holding an event, and there promises to be something for all walks of the <br>Norrathian Life to enjoy.<br><br>  The first event, I am proud to say, is the first of it's kind (as far as I <br>know). Once I read of an event where a guild held a gnome race across the <br>world. Well, today I announce a dwarf race of the same nature, except that it <br>is across all the known zones of Faydwer with the notable exception of Kedge <br>Keep. That's right, all participants will create newbie dwarves and traverse <br>Faydwer, to include Unrest, Butcherblock, and Mistmoore Castle. As well, we <br>are raffling off a full set of Crafted Armor for some lucky adventurer to <br>win. This is just the beginning, and it promises to be a fun filled month. So <br>without further ado, I will proceed to lay out the details of our first event.<br> <br>What:  Crafted Raffle<br>Where: Greater Faydark at the Wizard Spires<br>When:  After the Naked Newbie Dwarf Race (see below)<br>Rules: As of now you may log on to the Tribunal Server and begin purchasing <br>raffle tickets for a full set of Crafted Armor for warriors. The price is 5pp <br>a ticket and you may purchase as many as you want. Any HoV member will take <br>your order so long as you go to them and pay for the tickets. They will take <br>your name down and list how many tickets you bought, then relay that <br>information back to me. The next day you may ask me (Ignitz) what numbers you <br>have if you wish to know. The winner will be chosen at random using the <br>ingame random number generator. In the event that the winner is not present <br>to receive his/her prize then the set will be held until the winner can come <br>collect. Proceeds from the raffle will go to support more raffles like this. <br>Good luck to all who wish to participate.<br><br>What:  Naked Newbie Dwarf Race across Faydwer<br>Where: Kaladim near the Paladin's guild<br>When:  Friday, August 4th at 7pm CST sharp!<br>Rules: Registration will begin at 5pm CST near the entrace to Butcherblock <br>Mtns in Kaladim. All participants must register as the character they wish to <br>receive the prizes should they win. When creating the newbie dwarf you must <br>use Hov as the first three letters and the name of the character who <br>registered as the rest. (IE. Ignitz = Hovignitz).<br> To make things more interesting and to add an element of strategy to he race <br>the following rules are made:<br>  1. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins will start at 7pm on the dot with no <br>penalty to their start time.<br>  2. Clerics will start at 7:01. This is to illustrate that they have a <br>little bit better chance of surviving the race without much difficulty due to <br>the spells that they start with.<br>  3. Clerics may choose to accept the spell Divine Aura in order to give them <br>an even better chance of survival, but doing so will cause you to start at <br>7:02.<br>  4. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins may choose to begin the race with the <br>spell Skin Like Diamond cast upon them. Doing so however means they will <br>begin the race at 7:04.<br>  5. Clerics may also begin with Skin Like Diamond with a start time of 7:05.<br>  6. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins may choose to begin the race with Spirit <br>of Wolf cast upon them with a start time of 7:09.<br>  7. Clerics can start with Spirit of Wolf at a start time of 7:10.<br> <br>The race course is laid out as follow:<br>  1. Kaladim near the Paladin's Guild to Butcherblock Mtns.<br>  2. BB Mtns to Dagnor's Cauldren.<br>  3. Dagnor's Cauldren to Unrest.<br>  4. Once in Unrest you must make your way to the back of the zone, near the <br>backdoor of the mansion, and /poke the HoV member that will be stationed <br>there. Once that is done you may make your way back out.<br>  5. Unrest to Greater Faydark.<br>  6. Greater Faydark to Crushbone.<br>  7. Once in Crushbone you must make your way to the area behind the castle <br>and find the HoV member that is there and /poke them. You may then make your <br>way back out.<br>  8. Crushbone to Felwithe.<br>  9. Once in Felwithe, you must find the HoV member hidden within the city. <br>Once you have found them, /poke them then you may make your way back out.<br> 10. Felwithe to Lesser Faydark.<br> 11. Lesser Faydark to Mistmoore Castle.<br> 12. Once you are in Mistmoore, make your way to the other side of the lake <br>at the bottom of the entrance ramp and /poke the HoV members that will be <br>waiting there. You know the drill :)<br> 13. Mistmoore Castle to Steamfont Mtns.<br> 14. Steamfont Mtns to Ak'Anon.<br> 15. Once in Ak'Anon you must find me (Ignitz). The first four people to <br>/poke me are the winners of the race.<br> There will be HoV members in all the zones mentioned and upon entering each <br>zone for the first time you must /shout "Naked Newbie Dwarf Race!". This is <br>to prevent people from shortcutting. The winners will be not only the first <br>four people to /poke me but will also be the first four people to have <br>/shout'ed in all the zones and /poke me. If you forget to /shout the phrase <br>but manage to be one of first four participants to /poke me, I am afraid that <br>I will not be able to reward you on the grounds of not knowing if you <br>actually went through all the zones (non-negotionable).<br><br>Prizes: 1st place: 500pp and 10 tickets to the Crafted Raffle<br>        2nd place: 250pp and 5 tickets <br>        3rd place: 150pp and 3 tickets<br>        4th place: 100pp and 1 ticket<br><br>The prizes will be given to the character who registered the winning dwarf at <br>the Wizard Spires in Greater Faydark, where we will also be holding the <br>Crafted Raffle to take place immediately after the last participant finishes <br>the race.<br><br>Good luck to all participants in both events.

Here's part one of today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064692-2.html"><b>Fixing the Shaman Pet</b></a><br>Guys, the wolf is meant to be more of a companion than a pet. It's certainly not meant to be a major factor of how the class stacks up from a balance perspective. Shaman pets will never be near mage or necro pets in power. <br><br>I'll look into the mana requirement, but pet strength sounds proper.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064707-3.html"><b>"The Trend"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What's the deal? I grew up in a household where "No" from an authority figure was pretty much the end of the discussion. Am I the only one left who comprehends the meaning of "No"? Why are you guys wasting your energy on these dead issues? Wouldn't you be better off focusing your efforts on things that haven't already been shot down by Verant?]</i></font><br> <br>Part of the problem might be that we don't actually say "No." as it's construed to be impolite. We'd much rather say that "we have no plans at present..." or that "we'd like to do it at some point but..." The fact is, the answer itself is very *rarely* a solid "No." It's more often a soft-maybe with strong tendencies towards No. Perhaps we should use "No" more often :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064837.html"><b>Moving Characters to Morell-Thule?</b></a><br>Well we had moved all of those Test people there before someone realized that MT was still in the "race" (the period before the server matures where being 'first' at various things is enjoyed by the players). We moved them off, so my first indication would be that the guy came from Test and we missed him when moving them back out. <br><br>So no, to answer your question, Morrell is not a split server and we aren't performing character-moves as a matter of course. I'll be happy to look into the issue; Do you have the character's name?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064084.html"><b>Miller's Spawn Rate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi said the militia guards were changed from 6 minute spawns to 15 minute spawns in order to allow dungeon grouping to be a viable alternative, so shouldn't the same apply to the Millers?]</i></font> <br><br>They were originally set this low since they are quest NPCs. Of course, since I'm in a "replying to nerf requests" mood today, I'll talk to the guys about either making the Millers a lot tougher, or increasing their spawn time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059903.html"><b>Alchemy</b></a><br>Alchemy is a skill that we want to see financed by dealing with players, not NPCs, which is why NPCs have little use for the fruits of the effort. It's kind of the same situation as with fine-steel, which no one buys off of merchants since they charge so much for it. <br><br>It's one of those things in game to encourage people to deal with each other.</UL>

One of wich was a pet rampage that completely <br>cleared the PvP Area during the dueling competition.  This resulted in most <br>rogues 25-32 leaving before competiting.  The event was set back, the gm <br>arrived, and LoS was asked to leave the PvP area before it went on.  <br>Afterwards it was discussed but the overall reaction of the guild can be <br>summed up by with a total lack of respect for the event in general.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon made a lengthy post on PvP rules on the Gameplay Board a short time ago.  He also asks for thoughts and comments so don't hesitate to speak.  Here's the complete post<UL><i>Before I get into the subject of this post, let me define the rulesets in play on each of the PvP servers:<br><br>Rallos: Complete PvP. Players can attack any other player within a 4 level limit. Looting is coin plus one item, providing that the item isn't bagged, NODROP, or carried in a melee slot. There are no faction penalties for engaging in PvP combat.<br><br>Tallon/Vallon: PvP Teams. Players can attack any other player within an 8 level limit, assuming that the target is on one of the 3 opposing teams. Looting is coin-only. There *are* faction penalties for engaging in PvP combat.<br><br>As many here have noticed, there have been drives for each of the PvP servers, most recently Rallos, to get the server switched to coin-only loot. However, though the same drive once existed for Vallon, after the change was made, there was likewise a drive to switch it back to item-loot. This suggests that while there are people who enjoy coin-only loot, there are also people who enjoy item-loot. The difficulty that we are faced with is trying to make everyone happy. Simply implementing majority will on each server doesn't accomplish that objective, as it addresses the needs of the pro-coin crowd without taking care of the pro-loot crowd. As much as both groups come here insisting that "everyone" wants what they want, I don't think that anyone can truly deny that both groups exist.<br><br>Right now, we have two servers where coin-loot is in operation, and one where item-loot is the rule. That layout is roughly equivalent to the percentages that enjoy coin-loot versus item loot. The third who enjoy item loot, though technically the minority, are still a significant portion of the gaming populace, and as such should have their concerns addressed as well. Rather than just changing Rallos to coin-loot, it's been suggested that we allow people a one-time chance to move between the PvP servers. Though we are not yet prepared to commit to a plan of that nature, I do want to get everyone's opinion as to whether or not they would find such a plan acceptable. <br><br>If we were to allow moves, a two-step process would be used. First, Rallos people would be given the option to move to Vallon or Tallon (by choice), then Vallon and Tallon people would be given the opportunity to move to Rallos. If moved, players would suddenly find themselves in a new ruleset, subject to every facet of that ruleset. <br><br>Former Rallos players would find themselves on teams, in an environment that discourages socialization outside of your team. They would suddenly be subject to attack in an 8 level limit, and would take race-based faction hits for any PvP kills made. Players with strange deity selections (e.g. Half elf worshipping Innoruuk) would suddenly find themselves homeless for all intents and purposes. <br><br>Former team-server players moving to Rallos would have their ability to engage in combat restricted to a 4 level limit, and be subject to attack and able to attack anyone in that range. Any race-based faction penalties assigned while on the Team servers would follow to Rallos, and would not be reset.<br><br>Players on all PvP servers would encounter an influx of characters of all levels, who wouldn't be completely familiar with any server-specific player-originated rules of etiquette that may be in place. It is possible that aspects once understood as a "given" within the server community might break down and be no more. <br><br>It may sound like I'm trying to discourage acquiescence to this change, however I just want to be sure that all aspects of the proposal are understood prior to anyone giving an opinion on the matter.

Gordon <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064872.html">posted the following on the Gameplay Board</a> about the new item reimbursement policy:<UL><i>Hello all, <br><br>I'm sure that most everyone is aware of the new item-reimbursement policy for loss due to bugs. For those that aren't, here's a quick recap:<br><br>Our intention is to handle all claims in a timely manner. Upon receiving a claim of item loss due to a bug, the GM will begin the investigation process (checking logs, backups, etc). This usually takes roughly 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The GM will then immediately take action and reimburse the item(s) based upon the outcome of the investigation. Our customers diserve courteous and prompt service, and we'll do everything in our power to insure that they receive it.<br><br>One thing that we should have made clear in the announcement is that unfortunately, this policy is not retroactive, meaning that those who experienced loss prior to the time that the policy was announced (7/18/2000) would not be covered by the new policy. <br><br>As mentioned above, we do need to perform due diligence when investigating the claims, and though we will make reimbursements any time that we lack proof of any misconduct, we still need to have that information (backups, logs, etc.) present to perform the search. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Many attended, and due to the encouragement of the people of Luclin, Order of the Midnight Sun presents, KaranaFest: A Gathering at the Bridge. It is to be at the Wooden Bridge in NK rain or shine, 10pm EST to Midnight EST, to trade, drink, and to bring together the people who cannot attend the already established trade in the Tunnel on Saturday afternoons. <br><br>Please feel free to raid your bank(s), and bring all items, no matter how low level they are, for there were many newbies present on Sunday and many more are expected. Since it is difficult for all to bind in NK, dueling will be conducted at the Arena, a pleasant walk from the bridge, after most of the trading has been completed. <br><br>Thank you, and hope to see you all there, <br><br>Dahija<br>Order of the Midnight Sun<br>Warrior, Luclin</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Morgian sends the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings again my friends!<br><br>As some of you may remember a couple weeks ago a group of us participated in<br>a thread on the EQ Gameplay forum that discussed Verant putting up a<br>Role-play server.  The thread is locked now, but if you would like to engage<br>in reading a long but well done thread here's the link:<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546.html</a><br><br>Abashi was kind enough to respond to the thread and shot the idea down, but<br>what he responded to was not what we were asking for so that generated<br>another thread where we posted exactly what we wanted.  Our thoughts are to<br>only ask for a server designated as being role-playing (much the same way as<br>they have done for the PvP servers except they would be no code additions or<br>deletions).  The players would do the rest.  We really don't think this is a<br>lot to ask for and we feel it can only have a positive affect of EQ.  I<br>won't go into the entire thread here, but if you wish to read the thread and<br>show your support then take the link below:<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410.html</a><br><br>We're not asking for more skills, items, spells, or anything else that would<br>affect the game balance. Time and time again we've jumped from server to<br>server claiming it for role-playing but we've become to spread out and more<br>of the minority on all the servers then we ever were before.  All we want is<br>a clear cut home for role-players.  We really don't think that's a lot to<br>ask.<br><br>An in game poll is a suggestion we have also that would let Verant get an<br>idea of how many players would be interested.<br><br>Thanks again for your time and safe travels my friends.<br><br>Morgian Cessair</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon made quite a few posts this afternoon on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the full scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064461.html"><b>More Rallos Zek Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is NO WAY AT ALL that this can be implemented! The gankers just die, then come back again and again. They get an item then either bag or bank it. There's no way at all to "outlaw" the practice.]</i></font> <br><br>You can start. Refuse to take them on plane runs. Spread their name across the server. Don't socialize with them. Refuse to trade with them. Turn them into social Pariahs. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Secondly, you mention that the POD can only control one flag and that flag is already set for all Rallos players. Then PLEASE tell me why the POD is even there? He serves no purpose whatsoever.]</i></font> <br><br>You are correct, he serves no purpose on Rallos Zek. NPC spawns are not configured on a per-server basis. It wouldn't make much sense for us to maintain 34 different sets of spawn data to cover each server. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You yourself know that programmers can do anything and everything with the code. So, the POD can be changed to control other flags.It's that simple.]</i></font> <br><br>It's not that simple. Sure, a programmer can do anything. However doing it in a reasonable amount of time without affecting anything else isn't always possible, nor in the best interest of the game. In this case, there is no "other flags". Creating "other flags" would require a pwipe. Creating "other flags" without a pwipe would require more time than is feasible.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064451.html"><b>How much do un-nerfed Pumice Stones go for?</b></a><br>I doubt that the change has been in long enough for a stable market to form. It's pretty likely that when we missed a few vendors the first time that we were trying to implement the change that people rushed out and bought tons of the things. In any case, I'm pretty sure that the value will be severely limited due to the fact that it is still a 5 charge item. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064452.html"><b>What's the scoop on today's Tuning Meeting?</b></a><br>Hasn't happened yet :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064446.html"><b>Karana Still Overpopulated</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Any chance of getting another split to TT off Karana?]</i></font> <br><br>At this point that wouldn't be fruitful. We've already split them off a second time, leaving /movelog registration open for 24 hours, and only 169 accounts chose to move. It appears that everyone, or most everyone, on Karana at this point wants to be there. <br><br>If we were going to take another group, it would probably be from one of the other servers, but nothing along those lines is planned at present. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064423.html"><b>Monk Posts on Gameplay Board</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Good lord 17 monk posts on page 1?]</i></font> <br><br>That's interesting. For the past several months, monk posts haven't been out of the ordinary in number. It sounds as if this "drive" is being organized from an external source. I guess I'll take this opportunity to mention again that attempting to monopolize the front page with a specific issue will just lead to the posts being closed. <br><br>I haven't read any of the posts yet, but my guess is that they make note of specific issues relative to monks. Things such as "Thunderous Kick is too weak", "Flying kick should have some minimum damage", "Shiverback armor is low in AC", "Our Kunark armor isn't very good", etc. <br><br>While those might be good and accurate observations about some specific issues, stepping back and taking the entire class, even with its faults (which every class must have), leads to the inevitable conclusion that monks still rock despite their faults. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064442.html"><b>Monks Lose Power Post 50</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The gap, apparently, closes GREATLY.]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, the gap closes. Monks go up. Warriors and Rogues go up faster. No one "loses" relative power. <br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How can you keep calling monks the best toe to toe fighters? Perhaps pre 51 this was true, as we had a huge bonus in skill over other classes. But now that you've made Warriors and Rogues *nearly* equal in skill to Monks AND given them triple attack and double backstab ... there is NO way monks are still the best toe to toe melee damage.]</i></font> <br><br>Backstab is not a "toe-to-toe" situation. Yes, monks still do more damage in a toe-to-toe situation over a given timeframe than the other melee classes. Not as much as they used to, but they still do more than the others given appropriate equipment. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064416.html"><b>Invis Bug?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I was invis in CB throne room looking to see how full room was so that I would not start train. Since when can Orc Lego's see invis? I was standing there looking at them when one somehow saw me and attacked. I still had the "invis" icon on my screen and had just casted at steps to castle. Please explain ]</i></font><br><br>There's at least one thing that could have happened making it possible for a creature in there to see invis. Some creatures also have a chance, however miniscule, to see through invis regardless. <br><br>In any case, NPCs gaining or losing abilities that they had or didn't have in previous weeks is one of the things that can change in the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060259.html"><b>Wrongfully Suspended?</b></a><br>Though I can't speak to your specific issue, it's not at all unusual for suspensions or bannings to affect every account registered to a person or on the same credit card. This is particularly true if the suspended person logs on to the other account to contest the action. <br><br>For instance, if I have 4 accounts in my family, get suspended in one, then procede to log on to each of the others and contact a GM, they will all end up suspended. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I just have to laugh. In several years of running BBSes, every time someone tried to hack something or create multiple accounts or some stupid thing they got caught at, it was always "my little brother did it"]</i></font> <br><br>Hehe, you'd be surprised how unruly those "little brothers" are.</UL>

Catalyst sends word that <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo/">Ask Milo has been updated</a> over on EverLore.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Ok I have been playing EQ for about a year now and I love the game, but I have noticed something that i find very mundain and that is the attacking of the characters, have you every seen a karate chop Batman .. add a sword and **POFF** you have an EQ character (exculding the Monk class).<br><br>So my question is is there any plans to introduce new weapon attacks for the characters, there is nothing I would rather do than as a vile creature is running from me than to hit a hot key and trust my sword into the creatures back or slash at him or any thing besides CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP "yawn" . Just an idea or thought I had while watching my character CHOP at his target... ( excluding some small special attacks from the rouge "backstab" monk "kick" "tiger punch" ect.. ) I hope you can understand what I am asking, it does not have to be more damage just differnt motion of the characters. Thanks for you time :) <br><br> Milo Says: <b><i><br>I sympathize with you, but I'm not aware that there are any plans to make character animation more diverse. I don't think that we have the manpower for that, any more than we have the manpower to create more character models of unique build than I am able to construct. Rick Schmitz is our only animator, and unfortunately, his plate is full of more crucial work.</b></i></UL>Thanks!

I was sent the following report by Aaeandar:<BLOCKQUOTE>The masses gathered in the confines of the Wizard Portal in the Greater Faydark, the Land of Tunare's beloved.  They gathered together to unify and take our the minions of Innoruuk, and if possible, Innoruuk himself.  Members from Hamunaptra, Pax Tharax, In Virtue, Sixteenth Notes, Iron Legions, Coveit Emptor, and Circle of the Unseen, and set out as the sunset in greater faydark.<br> <br>The masses stealthfully moved into position and prepared for the long insuing battle.  For what seemed like days the warriors slowly but surely began to eliminate Innoruuk's minions, building by dreaded building.  Only suffering minor casualties in the process.  Then it came time to pull the dark lord's Maestro of Rancor from his dark pulpit at the heart of his pipe organ.  <br> <br>The Evil best tried its hardest, but even it knew that it had met its match.  The victory was ours, and again, we had only suffered minor casualties in the process.  We cleared the path to the Rancor's chamber and set up the last camp until we would attempt the Dark Lord Innoruuk himself.  But, would he even show his face after the beating we had issued to his lower minors, and beloved Maestro?  Only time would tell.<br> <br>As the lower extremities of Innoruuk's plane of hate were gutted and destroyed, we began to to destroy the Ashenbone Drakes.  The Drakes would fall in quick order, and then it came time to see if the Dark Lord was there to face the onslaught of warrior bent on his very destruction.<br> <br>As we moved our way up to his chamber we destroyed the last of his minions only to find that the coward of a god did not even both to defend himself and his own home.  We rejoiced at the victory, all had been slain at our feet.  Rare items distributed, and crusted blood on our weapons.  Soon, we will return for the Dark Lord himself, and then it will be his day of reckoning.... soon.<br> <br>OOC - <br> <br>Once again I'd like to thank the following people for organizing this raid, Oppression did a fine job in keeping things organized.  Diggle and his brave band of monks did more than sacrifice themselves to pull the mobs safely and with excellent precision.  Although we did suffer some casualties and 2 near full group deaths, we pulled of the corpse recoveries without a hitch and didnt lose even a step in getting back on track.  We destroyed the entire static spawn with 2 hours to spare until the respawn, and (to say it quite appropriately) we OWNED the Maestro.  The raid itself took roughly 10 and a half hours to complete, and for a Plane Raid was an outstanding success considering it was the server's first raid on the Plane of Hate.  Admittedly we were a bit disappointed that Innoruuk wasnt up, but nonetheless it was a very enjoyable experience.<br>I would also like to ammend my previous post about the Nagafen Raid we had a few weeks back, and add that Iron Legions was also present for the raid.  My apologies to Ekelhaft who also did a fine job as the main and secondary assist in this raid.<br>All and all, I'd like to thank those that came, and I'd like to thank those who invited me to come along.  This was incredibly fun, and very well organized.<br> <br>- Aaeandar "Bard of Doom" Vie (Pax Tharax) 46th Level Bard<br> <br>ATTACHED -  Screenshots of the Maestro and the Ashenbone Drake<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/rancor.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/rancor2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for the report!
