Ozzmar made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000291.html">a big announcement</a> recently on The Arena Board:<UL><i>TEST OF TEAMS<br>GM Ozzmar &#8211; GM Lithgar<br><br>The Dwarf zones into the dusty atmosphere known as the Arena, grumbling over his wet clothes he looks up at the green named coordinators &#8220;Where ya want me!?&#8221; Water flies off in all directions as he shakes his head wildly, his beard letting loose the soakend water. &#8220;That will be 32pp for entry Dwarf!&#8221; the coordinator shouts over the bustling conversations in the entryway. With a grinning smile showing a darkened chipped tooth the Dwarf rustles in his packs, he hands over 30 platinum pieces and 20 gold pieces, which the coordinator gladly accepts. &#8220;To your left dorf!, follow the wall until you see your kind, ye know, Gnomes, Halflings, all of you kneebiters!&#8221; The dwarf gives a deep chuckle and taps his sword while leaning towards the Coordinator &#8220;anytime ye fancy a showdown lad, I&#8217;ll be there to cut ya!&#8221; the dwarf snaps quickly right before he heads off into the dust. <br><br>Following the wall the stocky dwarf slows his pace, he sees a mass of people along the huge the blood caked pillar. The stout half sized warrior draws his sword and keeps a deadened gaze at the onlookers, as eyes meet in hatred. Locked, intent on foreseeing each other&#8217;s moves, the dwarf cautiously passes the crowd. One heckler shouts at him &#8220;Dorf! Joo com ere, mez stik yous now, mez saves us da trubl ltr har har!&#8221; A troll of unordinary size hearing the ogres&#8217; humor stands up &#8220; yessh wwwee kud see some foooood before the battle!&#8221; The troll uncovers an axe, the blade nearly half its size and bounds towards the dwarf. A scaled warrior seeing the ensuing battle springs into action and follows stride along the husky Troll. Upon seeing the danger, the dwarf throws his packs down and braces his stance as he grips both hands on the hilt of his weapon. His veins begin to bulge on his muscles as he raises the sword up into attack position. Unwavering he scowls at the two hideous forms of intelligence charging at him. But suddenly out of no where, a fire of from the heavens crashes between the Troll and the dwarf. An unfortunate Iksar, now just a slab of charred lizard, finds himself making a second attempt in reaching the arena in time. The dwarf nearly falls over in laughter at the turn of events, remembering clearly the warnings of the coordinator, &#8220;No PvP combat until the event starts.&#8221; The dwarf understood that this would be a troublesome rule especially in the arena, but in light of what could have just happened, he was glad the rule has been set. Picking up his packs and giving a gesture all too familiar to the Troll he bolts off further down the wall, deep wheezing laughter could be heard fading away from the evil, dark mob.<br><br>The next mob of people was more his size and nature, the dwarf sheaths his sword back into his packs. Gnomes were chattering to each out other in their fast paced tongue. Halflings were casually resting along the wall, so calm and collected they were he noticed. Some halflings were causally combing their foot hair like they didn&#8217;t&#8217; have a care in the world, as if they impending battle was to never take place. Grimacing, the dwarf never did like the happy folk but in battle there is something to be said about being able to look a comrade in the eyes. Soon though he did find his Kaladim brothers religiously drinking some ale and with an evil grin that would put Bertoxxulus to shame, he joins his brothers in celebration. &#8220;Aye good brothers, pass me some of that fine spirit!&#8221; Wiping his mouth he glances up at his dwarven brothers, &#8220;The purse? How much?&#8221; A dwarf with a holy symbol on his chestplate lifts his head with a smile, &#8220;5,000 shinies brother, bettered with my coin and yours.&#8221; He pauses for just a second before saying &#8220; and I fully intent on getting my coin back and then some.&#8221; All the dwarves and even a few halflings drink to that. <br>A green named coordinator walks up the short team drawing their attention with her words. &#8220;The rules are this!&#8221; as she continues with her speech another cooridinator begins to chant a binding spell on every team member, while taking note of the name of the bounded person and wishing them good luck. The other guide continues &#8220; you will be bound to this location outside of the inner circle, if you fall to misfortune inside the arena you will find yourself where you are now, You are to stay here until the end of the match. If ye decide to break this rule and make way into the inner circle you will be promptly killed and pulled back to your bind point, most importantly though&#8230;&#8221; the coordinator pauses and makes sure everyone is paying attention. She continues, &#8220;&#8230;Noted. This note will be used against your team and will result in 250pp being withdrawn from your winning purse and one less person left standing in the end will not count as standing. Beware gladiators this match could easily end early even if some of your team still stands if in fact this rule is broken.&#8221; The short warriors and casters nod in agreement all peering at each other in hopes that none would break this costly rule. The coordinator continues, &#8220;Once word is giving we will make way into the inner circle and you will all follow me to another pillar much like the one you are now taking shade under. At which point you will gather and patiently discuss your strategies for the battle. &#8220; She pauses. &#8220;YOU ARE NOT to engage anyone before the battle is to begin. If so you will be removed from the event.&#8221; The coordinator then answers a few questions from some not so bright halflings and in time finally beckons the mob to follow her into the deadly inner circle of the arena.<br><br>The short team was not the first to enter the arena, at the far wall one could see a mass of gleaming weapons and all around them magic being casted in astonishing displays of color. The dwarf was not unnerved by this comical show the elves were displaying. He was quite certain that the dwarving clerics would take very good care of him before the match began. The dwarf did respect the numbers the elven brotherhood held though, when he was finally settled in the location the guide had brought them, he stared intently on the elves counting their numbers. He counted 3 or 4 scores of the pointed eared kind from his vantage point. Comparing the force of his army to theirs he knew the elves had a few more blades. This prompted another deep chuckle from the dwarf for he also knew without a doubt that elves were terrible in battle. Feeling confident the dwarf opens his flask of ale and throws back a gulp, undoing his weapon from his pack along with a sharpening stone. The dwarf relaxes in savoring the sound of the stone against the metal and little sparks that it creates. &#8220;Warrior magic&#8230;&#8221; he mumbles letting his thoughts drift over the prizes the purse will buy him.<br><br>The short team and the elf team already stationed inside the arena, next comes in the human team. Their chins held high, they all walk into a chosen spot between the two teams already preparing for battle. Not much is heard from this team as they talk amongst themselves. If looked closely you could see the inner struggles some of the human clans were facing about the two other teams inside the arena. Fortunately, greed has its way of temporally setting aside friendships and the human team starts to enchant each other with spells to improve prowess in battle. The Eurdites form a circle and meditate in unison, while the barbarians much like the dwarfs sit quietly sharpening their weapons carefully inspecting the opposition with wry smiles on their battle worn faces.<br><br>The final team entering the arena creates a terrible display of vulgarity, bringing out the worst in the three other teams. The hated participants make their way to their chosen starting location. All eyes are on them and they know it. Taunting back, the evil team composed of the Trolls, Iksars, Ogres and Dark Elves, answer a barrage of insults with hideous laughter. What was most astonishing about the evil team was the size of the army they brought together. 5 or more scores of the wretched kind were eagerly awaiting a chance to inflict pain and suffering on the other teams. This brought much pride to the evil brethren but on the same token much fear. They all knew that the other teams would likely stop at nothing in bringing them down. The general air of the arena among the other 3 teams seemed to silently reinforce this disheartening thought. <br><br>A cooridinator raises his voice to the point that everyone in the arena could hear. &#8220;All teams are in place, no other participants will be allowed, and no spectators will see this event. The only way to now leave this inner circle is through Victory or Death!!&#8221; this prompts battle screams and mottoes from all 4 of the teams. When the cries calm down the coordinator continues, &#8220;The purse is counted at 7400 platinum pieces to be divided up amongst the winning team. We will now give you 10 minutes to make final preparations for battle. No PvP will be tolerated before the announcement is to begin.!!&#8221; The coordinator heads back to his chosen team and watches for infractions of the rules he stated. <br><br>For the next ten minutes, the atmosphere of the arena is of a calm before the storm. Casters are hurriedly finishing off final buffings to their teammates. Leaders are planning strategies and organizing teammates into groups. Coordinators are taking their places at both entrances readying their weapons for infractions of the rules. A two minutes warning is giving to the zone to prepare for battle.<br><br>A noble High Elf woman makes her way to the very center of the teams. Equipped with a flaming sword, Lady Daegarmo asks for a moment of silence in the seconds before the battle. Welcome to the Test of Teams citizens of Norrath! I wish you all the best of luck! On my mark&#8230;&#8221; She pauses for the remaining seconds of the 10 minute warning. <br><br>At the top of her lungs Lady Daegarmo screams with the power of the Gods, &#8220;FIGHT!!!!!&#8221;<br><br>--<br><br>This is not a pre-scheduled Event. There will be know prior notification as to when this event takes place. But it will. :)<br><br>If you see the announcement of this event on your server, we invite you to rally with your races and take part in the excitement.</i></UL>

Here's today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527.html"><b>Enchanters in Velious</b></a><br>Silh wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "However I think you have been very unfair to us in your decisions on the subject of illusions so far. And lately you have crossed the line for me."]></i></font> <br><br>Well, I might be able to disagree with the 'unfair' part, but I can't argue that we haven't crossed the line, for you. I will try to discuss your concerns, though, and perhaps that way we can move that line around a bit&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Like many enchanters I was surprised to discover that we do not have illusions past the level 44 (and only one at 44). When enchanters asked for finishing the spell line we were told that there was technical issues that stopped you adding new illusions in the game: The character global files (a name like that), which contains all the models that should appear in all zones (players and pets) had a size limited by the old 3D cards. EQ had to be compatible for people with those devices. <br><br>Fine. Something I can fully understand." ]></i></font><br><br>Good. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Enchanters have then proposed to Verant many ideas to go around this limitation. For example: illusion gender, illusion copycat : copy living creature (like minor illusion with living things), illusion animation (our pet). I dont know why they were discarded. For me it was a positive thing that players suggest ideas to you, and ideas that can work and are not unbalancing in any way." ]></i></font><br><br>Let me guess on these now, and I'll try to get more detailed answers for you later. <br><br>Illusion gender, I don't know why that couldn't be done. I do know why illusion copycat wouldn't be done. Keep in mind that your race is one of the things that determines how NPCs react to you. If an enchanter could mimic any creature he or she might very easily be able to travel anywhere with no risk. This isn't something that we want. I'd never heard the idea of Illusion Pet. It's interesting, though I wonder how odd you'd look&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "With the first expansion (Kunark) we were all waiting for the new illusions. Post 50 spells for enchanters meant some illusions for us ? Nothing. Except illusion iksar. What a surprise to discover that there was indeed some room inside this global file. Ok, you were keeping the room for the new iksar race. Again I can understand, except I do not like very much the fact that you didnt tell us the truth at first." ]></i></font><br><br>Some room and a lot of room are two different things. I imagine there will always be some room for things like that. The trick is how we use it, and would we rather give one class a new illusion, or create a whole new race? And, well, you got the new illusion, so I can't see the complaint&#8230; At that time there was 'room' for one more global (or ten more, or whatever, but one more that the programmers felt that they could spare for this use &#8211; remember, video memory does more than just store character art), and it was used for the new race. I see nothing wrong with that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The first disatisfaction for me came with illusion spectre given to necros. After telling us there was no room for a new model, you change your mind... and obviously not for the one that were asking for it. Let me tell you I felt bad : a pet was most important in your eyes than a player. Ok, ok, I know there is a player behind every pet, but that's the way i felt at this time. Again, I can understand that you chose to give some of this precious room in the global file to necros instead of us (it's your game after all), although i felt a little betrayed."]></i></font> <br><br>I would hope that nobody would feel 'betrayed' by anything we do here. We really do try to keep the good of the game in mind when we do stuff. But I can understand the feeling, I imagine that it seemed that someone was favoring one class over another. I don't know the whole story behind how that was done, but I'm certain that nobody was favoring anyone. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "At this point, we, enchanters were quite confident over the fact that you were giving us in the near future a spectre illusion. There was this time no technical issues, since the model was already in the global file. Second big surprise : you chose NOT to give us the illusion. Reason behind ? You told us there was another technical issue (sigh) : the spectre model has too many polygons and enchanters running everywhere in spectre illusion could create lag." ]></i></font><br><br>I've never heard that&#8230; <br><br>My personal opinion is that enchanters shouldn't have any undead illusions, that should all be left to the necros and their type. But I've never heard anyone say that spectres cause lag&#8230; I'll ask about that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Even today it's something I simply dont believe. It was blatantly not the true reason, but you didnt want to tell us the real one."]></i></font> <br><br>And by this you are implying, I gather, that the 'real' reason is something nefarious, such as Verant hates enchanters or something like that. That is, of course, pretty silly. For every Verant employee that plays one class, there are as many that play another. We don't favor any class. From a business standpoint that would be silly, and from a gamer standpoint it would be worse than silly. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "And with Velious Necros got illusion spectre. Hmmm. And you deny it to enchanters again. Hmmm.<br>Again: Ok, I could try to forget that necros are the only one to get a new model. I will insert here what I think is the true reason, which I can almost accept : A lich/spectre form for necros as the supreme spell of their spellbook should have no rival or else you would lose the really cool and unique aspect of this power. Even if it's only an illusion for enchanters, with no bonuses at all, the fact that another class have it would take a part of the "coolness factor". (please remember this argument when you'll come to the last section of my post)" ]></i></font><br><br>Ok, I'll remember&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "What irritated me the most on this subject was that you never answered clearly. Abashi said, if I remember correctly that the spell had a "high level of coolness". Sure it had. At the same time you were telling shamen that their shrink spell could not be used outdoor because It would have been purely a fun spell with no purpose and you didnt want that. I simply dont understand this double-reasonning (and I've never played a shaman in my life). We have entertaining-only illusions (all the undead ones which let me KOS with skeletons !). Fun is obviously a good reason for the existence of a spell. Why necros can have fun spells and not shamans ? Little disturbing to me."]></i></font> <br><br>I'll see if I can get clarification on the shrink thing&#8230; I guess it doesn't make sense to me either, the way you've described it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Back to our enchanter point of view. Ok so you gave necros a spectre pet, then a pet illusion, everything that was asked by enchanters to have their last illusions has been discarded. Ok. <br>Now Velious. We were (at least I was) hoping that something would come from this frozen continent. After all the previous requests for completing the illusion line of spell, and the necro issue, I was sure you would do something. Let me tell you that it was a big disillusion. <br>In velious Druids get a bear pet. Chamans get a bear illusion. No bear illusion for enchanter. Indeed: no illusion at all. Once again you told us that you have found new room in the global file for the bear model. Not for us. I felt very bitter at this point. I had the feeling you were giving purposely the new illusions to all classes except the one that was asking for. But since it's not a reasonnable attitude for a company I think now it's not the case." ]></i></font><br><br>Actually, I think the bear was already global, but I don't know, I'll find out. <br><br>Again, my personal opinion would have it so that only druids and shamans were to get nature-type transformations. I'm all for leaving that unique factor with them, and not giving it to enchanters. Again, that's my personal feeling on it. I'll see if I can get an official response for you on the reasons why. But don't discount the whole uniqueness thing, it's important. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "All these changes have contributed to a vast disatisfaction concerning the illusion issue. However it's true I was stil the master of illusions. Other classes got new changeform spells ? Good for them. I have no upgrade on this topic ? That's your right to not improve my class. But the last and most important change that came with Velious has simply destroy my last hopes and my actual enjoyment on illusions. You have given the summon monster line of spell to the mages. <br><br>This one change has vastly change the way norrath will look like and my illusionnist role in the world. How is it you gave to mages our old proposition of copycat spell for their pet ? How do you expect me not to see this as the ultimate betrayal ? After all this unclear attitude and answers on the illusion issue, I hope you understand how betrayed I can feel. I was -really- having faith in you Verant. I really thought that with Velious we would gain new illusions. We have seen other classes getting illusions with spells, items and so on. But after 2 years I was still hoping for something to come. And you gave more illusions to the mages pet that I could possibly mimic with all my spell line !" ]></i></font><br><br>Calling anything we do a 'betrayal' is too strong. And I also think you're using the word 'illusion' for far too many things. Mages have a summon, not an illusion. Sure, in essence it's not that different. But it's not the same thing. Keep in mind, the pet isn't going anyplace without it's master, so the fact that it might be the same as, and thus aligned with, other monsters in the area isn't as big of a gameplay problem. An enchanter with the ability to turn into something in the zone would be a lot more free to do as he or she pleases, bypassing dangers that might not have been intended to be bypassed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "This is disheartening. <br><br>I have lost the faith. <br><br>And it's not the usual complaint: "someone is getting what i wanted yada yada yada". I will explain why I feel the mage spell was a terrible blow to my illusionist aspect. It's absolutely not the same as the previous spells given to other classes. You have given mages a way to create and control virtually all creature types (not stats but appearance) of the world. I know it's not an illusion, but for me really the distinction here is very small. They have access to more appearance than me, the enchantress, will ever be able to imitate, even in my wildest dreams. I feel as if I am not anymore the master of illusions. I know it's a pet but that's how I feel."]></i></font><br><br>I don't know how to respond to that. I doubt that I can change your feelings about this. All I can say is that nothing was done with the intent of making you, or any enchanter player for that matter, feel unhappy. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "And it's worse than that. <br><br>You know, there was something "magic" with my class. I could surprise people. You know the feeling it is to be "special" in a world where everyone looks the same ? I know that very soon, due to the number of mages in the game, everyone seeing two monsters fighting again each other wont be stunned anymore. "Oh that's just a mage pet" will be the standard reaction. I used to amaze myself each time I saw my charmed mob fighting another mob. A mob fighting a mob is a terrible sight . Think of Hill giants ! Now it will rapidly become -trivial-. All the mages going across Norrath with giant, spider, gnoll, froglock, griffon pets will trivialized what was something unique and rare. <br><br>You have taken this little magic aspect of my class, the "wow" factor that I was so proud about. <br>And for THAT Verant I blame you so much." ]></i></font><br><br>Hang on there&#8230; What you're saying now is that we've ruined it because we created it&#8230; If we had given the exact same ability to, say, clerics &#8211; not that we would, then we would have ruined any illusion like that that we might have given to enchanters. So, by the same logic, if we had just given it to enchanters, it would have been ruined as well. The 'wow' would be gone shortly because enchanters were turning into things, so we would have ruined it for enchanters too, just by giving them the spell&#8230; <br><br>I'm not trying to suggest that your feelings aren't genuine. I'm just trying to keep this in perspective. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "I know many people who chose to start an enchanter for these illusion tricks. With the illusions, ALL the possibly imaginable illusions, given to the pet of a mage, I'm now a second-class illusionist. Not even that. In the game there are NPC enchanters who can turn into aviaks, Sarnaks, gnome robots. I'm limited to a poor set of illusions. I'm ashamed to see what mages can do in comparison. <br><br>I know perfectly that you wont change anything. I'm not even asking for it. Mages deserve a good spell like that. But the right move was certainly not giving away all the illusionnist aspect of my class to them. I feel very sad about all this stuff. <br><br>You know I have come to the explanation of all of this after some reflexion. I see the big picture now. Look at all the new spells introduced in this game after the initial release, especially the expansion ones: VERY few new spells. What you see is : <br><br>- upgrades to old spells<br>- Spells from one class given to another one <br><br>Not new spells. <br><br>That's a tendency that I really dont like in EQ. You are overlapping what all classes are able to do. Although it seems good at first sight, I think it's not the right decision. I'm not the integrist enchanter type which think he should be the only one to cast mez: I was very happy that bards get after such a long waiting a correct mez song. Giving mez to necros was however totally inconsistent with the class. You shouldnt blur the frontier between the classes. There is always a roleplay explanation to give something to someone. But you have to draw a line and dont mix everything. Else you are destroying the reason why someone want to play a specific class."]></i></font> <br><br>I agree, that spreading abilities out to too many classes dulls the class lines, and that's a bad thing in a class-based roleplaying game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "How about giving feign death to enchanters ? It makes sense, it's just an illusion corpse, right ? NO. Because feign death should not be given to everyone. I know it's easy and tempting to get the code of one spell and give it to another class under a new name and hop voila, a new spell is born. You are killing class diversity. Think again at the UO "tank mage" stereotype. We are far away from it in EQ but you are leaning this way. Really it's not the right direction. Please please respect the class specialities. There's no mystery why everyone plays a druid in EQ: they can do every little thing the other classes can, even sometimes better than the specialist classes ! The diversity and a sense of distinction between the classes is -necessary- <br><br>I know it's too late for the summon mob spell. But please acknowledge it was a very bad decision. You didnt had to take a code obviously targeted at the enchanter class (2years waiting...) and give it to the mages." ]></i></font><br><br>No, actually that code was created very specifically for the spell that it was used for. Honestly, a bit of coding magic was done to create it. And it was most certainly done to make the summoning spell, it wasn't some sort of holdover from some attempt at creating an illusion for enchanters. And, well, I don't think it was a bad decision. It's a great spell, and one that was warranted for magicians. If we had created a spell that allowed enchanters to turn into anything in the zone and had not created the Summoning spells, I imagine that some passionate magician might very well have written this post from his or her perspective&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "My fear actually is that the spell design team has moved on EQ2, err... "another project" as you name it. You are not creating new (=potentially unbalancing) spells for the game anymore, but simply moving spells between classes. If it's a design choice, you have to know that this choice for me has been the worse nerf to my enjoyment in the game to date. EQ is not about hack and slash only. I used to love my "surprise them" abilities. They are dead. Charm and illusions in one single move are going to be trivialized. Enchanters were few and their capacities so surprising. Now all the mages out there will make their visual effects common place. End of the "magic feeling" to be a little "special"."]></i></font> <br><br>Well, I disagree. I still think enchanters are the best class for surprises. I won't get into any attempt to convince you that the real magic feeling for playing an enchanter is the way you play it, beyond telling you that a summoned pet is just that, a summoned pet. They aren't very entertaining on their own&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Now I know that no new illusions will ever come. Sorry, but I have lost my faith in you. I believe the "no upgrade policy" about enchanters is due to our reputation on the boards to be crucial to all high level expeditions, to be god-like and so on. It was more simple and honest to tell us the truth you know. <br>Even if new illusions were to come, now that mages have all the possible illusions in a spell line, how could I rival ? I'm not the master of illusion anymore. In my eyes at least." ]></i></font><br><br>There is no policy about not upgrading enchanters. I think you are doing yourself a disservice by believing that there is. I also think that you are putting too much importance on what a magician pet looks like. <br><br>I'll ask a few questions about illusions and see what comes up.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040566.html"><b>More Weapons for Paladins?</b></a><br>I like the idea too (wolf's that is). But it probably can't happen. <br><br>First, as we all know, making a horse that could be ridden as a separate item is not going to happen. It's not something that we're going to try (as far as I know) with the engine. Just imagine player summoned boats in every zone&#8230; <br><br>But the idea of, essentially, an illusion for paladins that makes them look like a horse and rider and gives them some buff (like faster movement and maybe some stats) has flaws too. <br><br>All paladins with that spell up would look exactly the same. The illusion would have to completely rewrite the look of the character, and isn't going to take into account what armor the paladin is wearing. He'll look exactly like every other paladin on the same horse. They might be distinguishable by their weapons&#8230; <br><br>And, well, frankly, the next on the list (in my mind) for some new illusions (and use of the oh-so-precious video memory) should be enchanters. <br><br>But, it's a fantastical idear, and I'll pass it to the team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040623.html"><b>Identical User Names</b></a><br>I can't help but think of the Bill Murray movie, Multiplicity...(Ed. note: Wasn't that Michael Keaton?)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040632.html"><b>"How can you not twink?"</b></a><br>I've played many, many characters.

GameSpy has posted their <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/reviews/december00/sov/">two cents about what they think of Verant's recently released Velious</a> expansion.  When all is said and done the reviewer awards SoV with an 88/100 score, not too shabby!  The article concludes on this note:<UL>Even with a few difficult zones and dangerous NPCs around every corner, Scars of Velious is an outstanding addition to the EverQuest universe and is a must-have for all hardcore players. With a ton of new items to be discovered and over a dozen zones to be explored and conquered, S.o.V. is going to keep the EverQuest community busy for many, many months. Those who are just starting out might want to wait until they're above level 30 before purchasing S.o.V., as the new zones would be more or less a suicide run. <br><br>Of course, that could just add to the adventure, now wouldn't it?</UL>

A new message is now appearing on the EQ Patch Server:<ul>December 12th, 2:00pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>*New Velious Subscribers*<br><br>Please don't forget to run the "Velious Patch" off of the patch program.<br><br>*New Server*<br><br>We have a new server that will be coming up next week before the holidays.  It will be a split server for Solusek Ro, Karana, and Cazic-Thule.  Solusek Ro (which had about 200 people moved off about 9 months ago) and Karana (whose last split about 6 months ago did not go very well) will be split again with Cazic-Thule. <br><br>Though the population of Solusek Ro and Karana at peak usage times is not excessive, those two servers actually peak about 6 hours before the other servers due to a large overseas population.  This is why they are being split as opposed to other servers.<br><br>/movelog registration for the three servers being moved will open this Saturday at 10am (GMT-8).  It will remain open through 12 AM Monday, a total of 38 hours.  We apologize for the short notice but to delay the move any longer would mean putting it off until well after the Holidays. <br><br>By typing "/movelog yes" within the registration window, you indicate that you would like all characters on the existing account moved to the new server. The moves themselves will take place on Tuesday of next week.<br><br>We also have a new non-split server planned for the very near future as well.  It will most likely not go up until after the Holidays.  If that changes, we'll be sure to let everyone know.<br><br>-  The EverQuest Team</ul>

Here's one of Lady Dae posts again <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000283.html">directly ripped from the Arena Board</a>:<UL><i>Greetings Arch-Mage,<br><br>I come to you today with the announcement of a tournament. This tournament differs from all other tournaments that we have done before in the past in the aspect that it tests the very nature of the Magician in their summoning abilities and capability to find resources.<br><br>I understand your resourcefulness to be that which most other professions envy. Therefore, it is only fitting that this resourcefulness be tested as well.<br><br>The Best of the Best Arch-Mage Tournament starts in early January, but will start much sooner for those who wish to compete with the ability to win. Enter not with your prized possessions, but only that which you have summoned, or have had made by the many trade skills of the lands. The only exception to this rule will be the potions of the shamans, for these will be disallowed so that only the greatest of skills will be tested.<br><br>When you step into the ring for your match, you will be inspected by some of the most skillful guards in all of Norrath. They have the ability to check everything, including that which you can normally hide. Only trade-skill made items, summoned items, and spell components will be allowed to be on your person for the match. This will create a level of competition that starts well before the match commences, for only the greatest Magician will wear the true title of the Arch-Mage.<br><br>All items that you can summon maybe summoned before the match starts, except for your companion, which must be cast before the match. Only a single cast will be allowed, you will not be able to destroy your creation, in hopes of creating a second one, which has more power. Fear not, for your creation will see combat as we have requested that the banishing of pets not be used.<br><br>You may give your companion any item that is summoned or made with trade skills, and also use any item that is summoned or made with trade skills, as long as its not a shamans potion.<br><br>I will see you in the Arena of Lake Rathe in early January, but your mission starts now if you wish to be truly successful. I assure you that in undiscovered areas, in unread books there is equipment that will suit your purpose for this event.<br><br>Farewell,<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Events Supervisor<br>Sony Online Entertainment &#8211; Verant Interactive</i></UL>
