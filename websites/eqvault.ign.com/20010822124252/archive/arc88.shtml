Gordon made a few posts today on the Gameplay Board.

Peoples account status is only discussed directly with them. If the owner of the account would like to contact the head GM at <a href="mailto:lcarrick@verant.com">lcarrick@verant.com</a>, his questions will be answered.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037326.html"><b>Questions for Gordon</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1) If the Firey Avenger is the only 2hs that will allow a player to bash while it is equipped, why can a stupid little skeleton with a rusty 2hs bash?]</i><P> NPCs are not bound by the same rules as player characters. They can bash/backstab without weapons, they don't take damage from falling, they don't require air, and their spells don't use components. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 2) If all of us players would be upset when all of a sudden a dual-wield capable Mobs did dual-wield, why were all the weapons removed from the dual-wielding Mobs?]</i><P> I'm not quite sure that I understand this question. Many NPCs carry weapons. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 3) If a Ranger is a hybrid of a Warrior and a Druid, why does the Ranger track at level 1 and the Druid at 20?]</i><P> Class perk. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Why is the Ranger the only hybrid that retains dual-wield and kick?]</i><P> Another class perk. Rangers have melee skills nearly equaling the warrior, and in return give up heavy armor and hit points. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 5) Back to number 1, how can a dual-wielding Ranger NPC bash?]</i><P> See number 1 :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037343.html"><b>Canadian @Home Problems</b></a><br>I've received a few emails from a Videon customer in Canada who's getting timed out by a router in New York every minute or so for about 30 seconds, I assume that this is the same problem. At this point, my understanding is that the responsbile parties haven't acknowledged responsibility for the issue yet. <P>Web users wouldn't really notice this timeout which is why I suspect that there haven't been too many complaints. Real-time games are another matter. I would suggest that Canadian customers having this problem be very firm with their ISPs on the issue. </UL>

From Dragons:<BLOCKQUOTE>The online gaming world is vast and teeming with life.  In this world<br>you have solo players and you have guilds of players.  But there is a<br>3rd category of group that is very very rare yet very visible and<br>active.  That group is know as the OGG's (Online Gaming Groups).<br>Everquest has some like The Syndicate.  Other types of games do as<br>well.  OGG's are a special kind of entity going beyond what a normal<br>guild offers.  How do Everquest's OGG's stack up against those from<br>other game worlds?  What makes an OGG different from a regular guild? <br>What does an OGG offer to the gaming world its in? Well Gamespot has<br>released the following article discussing what is an OGG, sharing the<br>most prevalent ones and  then discussing how they stack up.

Brad McQuaid responded to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037218.html">a thread</a> asking a few questions about what's next for EverQuest as a whole.  Here's the original post and Brad's response from the Gameplay Board:<UL>I'm going to take a moment here to eat some crow and commend Verant on Kunark.<br>Kunark is split into two apects: Levels past 50, and the Kunark zones. Both have been extremely well done, and both exhibit an intellegence and creativity that your past work didn't even hint at. The new kunark zones and the amazing capabilities of characters past level 50 make the rest of the game pale in comparison.<br><br>Now we've gotten to the subject of my post: What about the rest of the game? Kunark is stunning but there are still zones in the "old game" that aren't even near fully utilized.<br><br>Will work on the "old game" be abandoned in favor of doting on the new and expensive-to-create Kunark?<br><br>Will we ever see graphical enhancements to the "old game" to bring it at least a little more in-line with the current majesty of Kunark? Will "The Hole" ever open!? Will Odus ever be worth going to? Will NPC's which previously just stood around (and there are a lot of them - the majority in fact) saying nothing when you hailed them ever start saying things?<br><br>Will the "Old Game" ever be more polished than it is now, or will you neglect it in favor of your pretty, new Kunark?<br><br><br><b><i>Faxor, <br><br>First, thanks for the compliments -- Kunark was an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and do better. And in the future, we'll top Kunark <br><br>Now, to your questions.<br><br>1. No, we will not be updating the graphics on the old zones. This is primarily for two reasons: a. Resources are limited and I really think most of our customers would rather see new content as opposed to re-doing older content, and b., as was mentioned in this thread, it's not really appropriate to change the system requirements on the existing lands, which upgrading the graphics significantly would. That said, we have at least one minor way we're going to be upgrading the original world soon.<br><br>2. The 'old game' will definitely NOT be abandoned. The EQ Live team will continue to address crowding issues by revamping the lesser used dungeons and other zones. In addition, many of the zone mechanics that are being tried in Kunark, should they prove successful, will be used in the older zones when they are revamped as well.<br><br>3. The Hole is still on target for May, probably late May. After the Hole comes the Warrens, which is also on Odus. And we will continue to add free zones after that.<br><br>4. Yes, I think slowly but surely existing NPCs will be made more interesting, possibly involved in quests and storylines.<br><br>Hope that helps,<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>

Gordon was up all night (and morning) making even more posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's quotes and excerpts from all his latest:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036316-2.html"><b>Where's the music in Kunark?</b></a><br>We're looking into this. We'll probably patch some .xmi's to the missing zones soon. They'll be pretty simple, just getting combat/underwater/boat music to work. Perhaps we can also customize some of them for some situational music. We are however limited to the music already in game.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037145.html"><b>More on Recent Spoiler Split</b></a><br>Actually, over 1000 people from each server were moved. However, when we publish that we are taking registrations, invariably people who don't play at peak ask to be moved, as do people who have multiple accounts. Unfortunately, there's no magic way to determine what percentage of those moved represent peak usage. Population on Veeshan rose to 2800 at the time that we opened registrations, so it's quite evident that many of those who were running the command were not peak users. <P>We'll give it a few more days to stabalize and then may consider moving some more.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037190.html"><b>The Tireless Gordon Wrinn</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Man, it's 3 AM and you just posted a response to my "where's the music?" post and some others! What the heck are you doing up so late anyway?]</i> <P> Just can't drag myself away :)  Actually I logged on to find that music post as I meant to get to it earlier, and figured I'd get to a couple of others while I was here. <P><i>[Quote from original post: BTW, has that guy that's dedicated to fixing the EAX SBLive! bug given you any progress reports? Switching my hardware settings is getting irritating.]</i><P> Yes, he's still working, pretty much exclusively on sound issues. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Oh, and next time you see him, remind GZ that expansion is out so he can go ahead and take a second look at that Bard Lullaby 95% resist rate issue when he feels up to it.]</i><P> I'll do that. As I recall he's got a couple of things that he said he'd check post expansion :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037193.html"><b>It seems unfair that some are still bound in Timerous</b></a><br>Changing bind spot of characters outside the scope of doing it in game really isn't feasible. In any case, I don't think that there's enough people bound there for it too be too big of an issue, and I highly suspect that people there will be changing their bind spots soon.</UL>

Mince sent me the following event announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Mince's Dungeon Crawls (Luclin server):  Runnyeye, May 3rd<br><br>Greetings adventurers, I am Mince, a proud Gnome Gemchopper and Nomad Lore guild officer.  I am of the opinion that many areas of Norrath, especially dungeons, are underutilized.  In order to promote these areas as well as the art of the Dungeon Crawl, I intend to periodically lead expeditions to these locales.  The last expedition to Befallen was a great success with over 40 participants combing the dungeon.  I am looking for hearty adventurers to join me in these expeditions.  Be forewarned that dungeons are dangerous and have their own unique challenges (i.e. locked doors, traps, large groups of monsters, etc.).  Also, it will be a Dungeon Crawl (meaning we will be moving from room to room, not camping in the same spot).  Therefore, power levelers, campers, and people that run at the first sign of danger may not find this experience to there liking.  However, for those who enjoy joining a band of adventurers and conquering a dungeon while focusing on fun, companionship, and defeating foul beasts, please come out and join me.  <br><br>Target:  Runnyeye Citadel, a goblin stronghold located between Misty Thicket and the Gorge.  It is a huge dungeon that I know very little about.  It contains hordes of goblins as well as some other exotic creatures like Evil Eyes and Gelatinous Cubes.<br>Level range:  15-30th.  Groups will be formed the day of the event.  Rough group ranges will be 15-20, 21-25, and 26-30. <br>Rallying point/time:  The Wall in Misty Thicket at 8 pm Pacific time (Wednesday, May 3rd).  Please be geared up and ready to go.  It is encouraged that you bind yourself in Rivervale beforehand.  The dungeon is roughly 1 minute travel time from the rallying point.<br><br>Any questions?  Contact <a href="mailto:mince@luclin.com">mince@luclin.com</a> or Mince in-game.  And be on the lookout for future Mince's Dungeon Crawls in the weeks and months to come.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

GameProWorld has published two EverQuest articles on their site.  The first is a <a href="http://www.gameproworld.com/gpw/pc/article/0,1579,5381,00.html">review of the expansion</a>.  Kunark is given a 5.0 on the fun scale and ends on this note:<UL>Fans of EverQuest probably already have Ruins of Kunark, simply because it's more fuel for their obsession. If you've ever thought of coming to visit Norrath for the first time, now's a great time. If Ruins of Kunark is any example of what Verant can do, then EQ fans should have a lot to look forward to in EverQuest's future. </UL>The second feature is titled <a href="http://www.gameproworld.com/gpw/pc/article/0,1579,5367,00.html">EverQuest: Year One</a>.  This article takes a look at the past year in EverQuest's history.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>After a year of release, EverQuest is still going strong, with 31 servers, each holding around 1500-2000 players at peak times. As long as Verant continues to support its baby with updates, improvements, and new challenges, PC gamers all over the world will continue to lose sleep and tie up their modem lines in the interest of saving the blighted world of Norrath. </UL>Thanks Jay!

It should be pretty interesting.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037130.html"><b>Kunark Sounds Update</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I heard that the Kunark sounds will be added in a later patch. As of now, Iksar make no noise when they get hit, and everything else sounds like a human (goblins, skeletons...). Any ETA?]</i><P> Aiming for a week, perhaps two.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037030.html"><b>RoK Refund Confirmations</b></a><br>You will indeed receive a confirmation when your request is processed. We ask that everyone who's getting one hang tight, much of it has to be done manually since the request is filed through email.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037058.html"><b>Binding in Kunark</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: So what's the story with not being able to bind in the zone? Casters can bind in every zone except for one why? Magic barrier? Hole in the ozone layer? What?]</i><P> Actually, with Kunark, we implemented many zones that do not allow binding, dungeons espicially. As for not being allowed to bind in this zone, I think that even some of our bigger critics will agree that allowing binding in this zone created a bit of a balance issue. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037020.html"><b>NPC Binding</b></a><br>But on to your question, we've discussed the issue of NPCs binding recently. It's been a bit of a recurring topic, and we've firmly decided against allowing it. There are a number of reasons, only one of which is the economy of lower level casters. For example, we want to encourage people to meet each other, and giving everyone a reason to come to the cities is a good way to do that.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037023.html"><b>Server Status</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: just curios because the new servers don't show up on the eqvault or everlore evermon pages. it also shows veeshan and the other splitters went back online at the same time as the others]</i><P> Yep. The other web sites have to get their developers in to update their pages before the new servers will show. Saryrn and The Seventh Hammer are up.<P><b>Note from Aurum: We're working to see what the problem here is.  Whenever new servers are added our Server Scanner adds them automatically.</b><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037016.html"><b>No Prexus Split</b></a><br>The message on the scheduled downtime page that mentioned Prexus and a split was incorrect. It was supposed to say Bertox. As for whether or not Prexus will ever be split, it's too early to say for certian.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036968.html"><b>Ape Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why are all the Apes in burning woods Undead??  Shouldn't they be animals? They sure look very much alive.]</i><P> Just checked into this. They are indeed meant to be undead. The other live apes in the land are a little too evolved to be considered animals in EQ. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036805.html"><b>More on Veeshan's Peak</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: AT NO TIME SHOULD A PLAYER RUN THE RISK OF LOSEING EVERYTHING THEY OWN PERIOD. I can understand a risk of getting killed and loseing Exps if they want to do something make deaths in these zones no res so its a permant exp loss and they have to earn it back or put a delay in the cropse recovery time so that after 24 real hours your corpse will pop back to the zone line or to a safe room.]</i><P> A little bit of fear is a good thing. It keeps things exciting. If the thought of losing what's on your corpse is not palatable, the simplest suggestion would be to not put yourself in a situation where that could happen. This isn't a case where you risk everything you own, just everything that you choose to carry with you. <P><i>[Quote from original post: There is NO FUN in loseing a corpse ]</i><P>Perhaps not, however there is great fun being in a situation where you know that you could lose your corpse, and prevail. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033829.html"><b>Ninja Looting</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Ok I want ask you folks a question and I'd like you tell me what you think. Ninja looting is now forbidden.  What constitutes "Ninjalooting"?<P> Situation 1.)Lets say your in Oasis, your prowling around looking for DW crocs to kill. On the ground next to the lake is spectre corpse. There is noone around. You wait for a minute and still see noone. Or at least noone is medding nearby, no pc's are hovering nearby.<P>Is it ok to loot this corpse or should you let it rot? <P>Situation 2.)Your in freeport and run accross a dead guard. Again nooone is around. Is it ok to loot the corpse? <P>Situation 3.) your in a group killing orcs in crushbone. Noone moves to loot the fallen orcs. <P>How long do you wait until you loot them? <P>And do you folks leave groups with people who don't adhere to loot orders?<P>I don't mean to sound like some greedy SOB but this game requires money to play. My mage has expensive spells to buy, priest has spells AND money to buy, etc.But I want to be fair as well. And I don't want to be labaled as some evil ninjalooter. So I'm asking for advicee.. What do you folks think?]</i><P>Well, to be honest, all of these scenarios would have to be evaluated by the GM or Guide who's involved. I would say that one of the most common cases of ninjalooting I've heard is where a big group takes down some nasty critter. One guy is keeping the corpse open so no one loots, and when he stands up so that the lotto winner can loot, someone who's been madly right-clicking jumps in instead. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036583.html"><b>Factions in Kunark</b></a><br>The factions in Kunark are pretty complex, but it is as intended. The stronghold in the Overthere is filled with NPCs loyal to the same NPCs as those in Karnor. Players should seriously consider where they want to be faction-wise prior to killing anything that moves.</UL>All spotted on the Gameplay Board.

A new message is up on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>April 28th, 6:00am<br>-------------------<br><br>*Patch Today*<br><br>Several changes were implemented as part of today's patch:<br><br>*Spells*<br><br>- "Scale of Wolf" is now group-only.  You must be grouped with the target in order to cast this spell upon them.  This change was made due to the fact that Scale of Wolf overwrites Spirit of Wolf, which may be more desirable in some situations.<br>- The "Cannibalize II" spell has been enhanced.  <br>- Corrected a bug with "Song of the Sirens" that caused an unintended level-cap to affect the spell. Bards should now be able to charm everything that they once could with this spell.<br><br>*Binding in Timorous Deep*<br><br>Due to a feature within the zone, players can no longer bind within Timorous Deep.  This functionality was intended in the zone prior to launch, as binding presents a possible balance issue.  Players who are already bound in this zone will retain their binding location until they bind someplace else.<br><br>*Iksar Quests*<br><br>A few items associated with the Iksar newbie warrior quests have been repaired. The EverQuest team would like to extend thanks to those who reported the problems.<br><br>*Iksar Factions*<br><br>As announced in the patch server message yesterday, this morning we corrected a bug in Iksar faction that allowed them to travel outside Kunark without fear of being attacked by most things.  In the event that any young Iksar find themselves in a bind/death loop, please /quit, log in another character, and /petition for assistance.<br><br>*Server Splits*<br><br>The recently announced server splits will be completed roughly two hours after the other servers come up from this patch.  Movelog registered accounts from Veeshan and Bristlebane will be moved to Saryrn, and Xegony and Bertox to The Seventh Hammer.  As requests to move were very strong, we were not able to move everyone who requested.  We appreciate everyone's understanding.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Gordon Wrinn, Verant's Internet Relations Manager, made a large number of posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's quotes and excerpts from them:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037005.html"><b>Melee Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Seems that the skill cap increases for our primary skills (HTH , 1HB, Offense, Defense, etc)have run into a hard cap of 252. I know this must be a programming issue, but it has had the effect of weakening us relative to our melee brethren (ie, Warrior offense increase from 200 to 240 - Monk offense increase from 240 to 252.)]</i><P> Not really. We've accounted for any data-type mandated caps in code. Though you may stop skilling due to reaching 252, you'll still get better as you level. The gap may close a little bit, but not by any great extent. <P>Please keep in mind that a classes power relative to another class changes as they level up. It's not something that is fixed in stone. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Is it still Verant's vision that Monks be the "kings of melee?"]</i><P> We're beginning to dislike the "King of..." and "Master of.." titles that have been floating around. It gives classes the impression that all classes should be the master of "something", where "something" must be something that "matters". The only real important thing here is that some classes must be better and worse at some things than other classes. One class need not be the master of something. Maybe instead they are second-best at a few things. <P>In any case, monks will still do more melee damage in a toe-to-toe fight than the others.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036973.html"><b>How are Spectre Pets going to dual wield?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Hey Abashi - How are Spectre Pets gonna Duel Wield? Just wondering, all the screenies I have seen show them with the standard scythe]</i><P> The standard scythe is actually part of the character model, not an indication that they are actually wielding the weapon. To my knowledge, this is the only model that this was done with. Anyway, I'm not willing to comment on the dual wield issue beyond saying that we haven't overlooked anything.<P> It's my intent not to talk about the spells until at least a few people actually have them.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036998.html"><b>What Server is the Newest?</b></a><br>Morell-Thule and Torvonnilus are the two newest "newbie" servers (meaning that everyone there started on that server at level 1. Saryrn and The Seventh Hammer just came up today, but are primarily populated with people moved from other servers.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036988.html"><b>No Split for Mithanial Marr</b></a><br><P><i>[Quote from original post: Just wondering why Mith Marr wasn't inclued in the server splits. We have been at 2200 or 2300 every night for a week, I though the target was 1800.]</i><P> Mith Marr (and the other servers that people ask about for that matter), was not split because we were only splitting 4 servers. At the time that we decided what 4 servers would be split, Mith Marr was not in the top 4. <P>We'll certianly keep Mith Marr in mind for future splits that we may consider.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036930.html"><b>Not Taking Servers Down in Primetime</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: You also didn't do all of it in primetime(for US) on a Saturday or Sunday. You are getting better).]</i><P> Well we certainly never plan outages in primetime, but unfortunately they are necessary once in a while. Hopefully everything is stabalized after the Kunark rush and we can rack up some uninterrupted uptime :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036940.html"><b>Tallon Zek Split</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Verant, can you give us any indication on if and when the move will be allowed between Tallon and Vallon and possibly how it will be handled...]</i><P> No info on this yet. We're going to start discussing it again in the near future, after any Kunark-related fires are out. I'll release some more information as soon as I have it.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036966.html"><b>Patch Problems</b></a><br>Hopefully the problems with the patch servers are resolved. We replaced/added a couple more of them today.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036927.html"><b>Tier'dal Language</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post:Just wondering if there is a documented dark-elf language...If so, could you post the site or where to get it...]</i><P>Back in beta I recall that there was a site that was dedicated to all things Tier`dal, including a devised artificial language. However I can't remember the URL of the site for the life of me. I think it might have been named something like "The Dark Elf Compendium".<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036928.html"><b>Nerfs, Nerfs Everywhere</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why all New Necro stuff Erudite/Human only??!!]</i><P> Erudites are a rather paranoid bunch, with all their spies and their lofty delusions of self-importance. I guess they didn't want their creations being used against them in the future :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036920.html"><b>A Well Informed Society</b></a><br><P><i>[Quote from original post: How do the people (NPC's) get informed so well? Do the bards have some new fingerprint analysis system or what?]</i><P> Yeah, something like that. In order to make the faction system mean something, universal recognition was pretty much required.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036806.html"><b>Bodies and Rotting</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I would like to know why Verant would set a booby trap to intentionally cause people to lose their corpses? Its the only answer... you KNEW rogues would stumble across the orb long before we were ready to solve this zone, you gave ZERO warning about the Howling Stones, Why will you not post a warning about this zone and get the bodies in it out? <P>For those who don't know, consider yourself warned. In the base of the Canyon in Overthere is ruins. Inside these ruins is an orb with a lock at the base of it.. Pick this lock and be instantly teleported to a zone called "Howling Stones". That means, 1 rogue - solo, vs 4 - 8 mobs that guard the entrance point. The weakest appear to be Sepulcher Skeletons that hit for 117, some of these guards hit for 150+. Some are shadowknights.. one person reported 4x Harm touch before their screen drew up. No group, no warning and once you've done this then verant says tough luck. I have a guildmate who's corpse will rot by sunday and this situation has been repeated on every server. <P>How about cutting people some slack Abashi? How does this add to the game??]</i><P>Well in this particular case, that key-teleporter was set to "pickable" by mistake. It should be ok now, and the GMs will assist those who popped into the zone by mistake. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036888.html"><b>Kunark Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I don't know how to put this delicately. The graphics for the female Iksars and the males are switched. The males are wearing French Cut Bikini bottoms and the females are wearing boxer shorts...In itself this is okay but the boxer short graphics has a definate buldge...hehe...I am sure that the pointer telling the graphics which one to use for male and female are pointed in the wrong direction. Is it possible to fix this sometime soon in a patch? <P>Secondly, there have been a huge amount of rude, lude, and harrasing comments made to me and some of my sisters about the undignified way that Female Iksars sit. Is it possible to have them sit with their legs a little closer... ;)]</i><P>Now this intrigued me so I had to go check. You are talking about the newbie outfit textures/models, right? They looked OK from my end. Oh, and I guess Iksar aren't known for their social graces :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036801.html"><b>Patch and Kunark Registration Issues</b></a><br>Yesterday's patch fixed a problem on the Kunark Registration page that kept people who purchased the retail box overseas. Basically there was a problem printing the account keys, which truncated the last digit. This wouldn't affect anyone who acquired it in the States. <P>If you are having a problem upgrading your current account with a retail box acquired in the States, I'd first check to see that zero's and O's haven't been mixed up. On the sticker, Zero's look like rectangles, and O's look like diamonds.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036775.html"><b>Verant's Decision to Nerf Timorous Deep</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Verant not only nerfed binding there, they ruined Timorous Deep.  Now you can't bind ANYWHERE in the zone if you are a caster... guess they had to nerf the firepots (can't have moongates can we) but good god, isn't ruining an entire zone's hunting potential a little extreme? Viable zones in kunark = kunark zones - 1]</i><P>We don't agree that taking binding out of the zone "ruins" it, as if that was the case then melee players would be at a serious disadvantage. This zone was supposed to be nobind at release, however we forgot to set the flag. It was a case where we either had to do this, or remove the "feature" that everyone thought was so cool in the zone. <P>I would say that melee types won't mind a short boat ride to use this feature.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036762.html"><b>Kunark and Experience</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Am I the only one that noticed that Mobs on Kunark are way too tough for their lvl and give way too little exp? there are lvl 40 mobs there that do 120-130 damage and take forever to kill, and give horrible exp. I hunted for 20 hours in Kunark and gained half a bub into 51, I then went to Lower guk for about 3-4 hours and gained half a bub, that is just sad. I fear when the newness and coolness wears off Lower guk and Sol B are gonna go back to their usual crowded state.]</i><P> The amount of experience they give when killed is no less than the experience given anywhere else. But yes, things there are harder for their level.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036688.html"><b>Hsssssss! No mud crabsss to be found!</b></a><br>They are out there, they are just a bit more rare than your average forage.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036686.html"><b>The Balancing Act</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why doesn't Verant put together a team of experienced Gamers (GMs, Roleplayers, Beta Testers as a balancing team for EQ. They could come to a consesus on various issues relating to Character skills, abilities and spells. They wouldn't have direct control over the design/code of EQ. Instead, they would submit their findings to the design/code team. Together aggree upon what would be best for EQ overall. Instead of just the whims of a few, EQ could draw upon a vast pool of RPG knowledge/experience.]</i><P> Your assumption seems to be that a "team of experienced gamers" and the "design/code team" are two different groups of people. Everyone on the design/coding team *is* an experienced gamer, and *is* experienced with EQ from the perspective of a player as well. In addition to this, we also rely on the opinions of those on the Test Server, *and* the opinions of EQ players who make suggestions in game and on boards such as this. <P>"Consensus" however is not an easy thing to find in a large group. Certainly people can agree on broad concepts such as "My class is too weak", but the method for addressing the concept varies greatly. <P><i>[Quote from original post: For example, most think a Ranger should be the most powerfull Archer in the game having only to rely on his blade for close encounters]</i><P> I'd have to disagree that "most" think this. I would agree that "most" think that archery should be more powerful, but I don't think that people believe that rangers should be archers first, and melee second. Human nature is to want to have all of the advantages, and none of the disadvantages, or in other words, to have your cake and eat it to. Given that rangers are balanced, perhaps a better question would be how many rangers would be willing to lose (meaning that they'd no longer be able to do things that they can now) melee abilities in exchange for stronger archery? <P>Being honest up front, though the question is more fair than just asking "how many want stronger archery", it's not something that would be done for EQ at this point. We honestly are not interested in drastically redefining a class at this point, and a redefine is what would be necessary to make an "Archer" class. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036562.html"><b>Root Nerfed?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Maybe its just that i can see the message when it break. However, it just seems all of my immobilize spells are being broken VERY fast...MUSH faster than before..inspite of usage of DD.]</i><P> There haven't been any negative changes to the root line in a long time (over six months). The only change that was made recently was to reverse the order in which the root effect and damage effects are applied from the druid root line, which should make it break less.</UL>

John Smedley responded to another post regarding the FTC rules on the EQ Gameplay Board today.  Here's one of the first posts followed by Smed's response:<UL>The lowdown on the FTC rule is...<br><br>If you order goods by mail, phone, computer or fax (other than photo development, magazine subscriptions, seeds or plants), the Federal Trade Commission's Mail or Telephone Order Rule requires that the seller ship to you within the time promised or, if no time was stated, within 30 days. <br><br>If the seller cannot ship within those times, the seller must send you a notice with a new shipping date and offer you the option of canceling your order and getting a refund, or accepting the new date. If you opt for the second deadline, but the seller can't meet it, you must be sent a notice requesting your signature to agree to yet a third date. If you don't return the notice, your order must be automatically canceled and your money refunded. The seller must issue the refund promptly--within seven days if you paid by check or money order and within one billing cycle if you charged your purchase.<br><br>I guess Verant needs to learn that when it comes to violating consumer's rights...they're in our world now.<br><br>-archtype<br><br><b><i>I for one don't believe archtype doesn't have a right to be angry. In all honesty, I would probably be angry myself. We aren't running, hiding, or ducking any kind of responsibility in any way. We messed up and we have to make it right. It's as simple as that. Also, just because it's a "game" doesn't mean we don't have to deliver things on time.<br>With all that said, I can tell you that we've been doing virtually nothing but rectifying this problem. Also, I'd like to point out that we have extended our refund policy.<br><br>Archtype, do me a favor and email me all your info (including the tracking number Zomax gave you) and I'll be happy to check it out when I'm at work tomorrow morning.<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</b></i></UL>

Verant CEO John Smedley posted another update to the EQ Store situation on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>Hello All,<br><br>Many of you have been wondering why the EverQuest Store isn't up right now, so I'd like to take a moment to address this issue.<br><br>Obviously things didn't go smoothly in regards to the shipping to many people who bought Kunark. We're very sorry for the problems we have had. <br><br>We felt that until we have completely straightened out the problems with this process that it isn't fair to put it back up. We don't want to throw gasoline onto a fire.<br><br>We're taking the time to correct the back-end problems that caused this in the first place. Until we're satisfied that this process is completely smooth we won't be putting it back up.<br><br>As of now we don't have an ETA, but once we feel confident that we can deliver orders in a timely and efficent manner we will put it up. We will make sure to keep you all informed as to our progress towards this goal.<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL>

I'm also having new /MOTD's put on the servers to be sure that people get the word.<br><br>/movelog registered accounts from Veeshan and Bristlebane will be moving to Saryrn, Xegony and Bertox to The Seventh Hammer.<br><br>I'd like to remind everything that corpses will not follow the account, so everyone will want to make sure that there corpses are looted, or they will be lost. I'd also like to note that more people requested the move than we will be able to accommodate, and we appreciate everyone's understanding in this matter.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>He added another bit later on:<UL><i>I should also mention that the six servers involved in the split (Bristlebane, Veeshan, Xegony, Bertox, Saryrn, and The Seventh Hammer) will be down for roughly two or three hours longer than the other servers.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Gordon made a few more posts since the first of today's regular Infobit post.  Here's the newest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036439.html"><b>A 'No Nerf' Server</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why can't we have a server that does not have anything to with balance of power. This server will just add fun content. I mean if some class comes up with a good idea then they just add it. No more hearing that it will make things unbalance.]</i><P> One of the foundations of massively multiplayer gaming, and gaming in general for that matter, is that there must be challenge in order for the game to be fun. In this game, game balance is required for there to be a challenge. Implementing suggestions without concern for game balance would lead to there being less "fun" in our opinion. <P>Most of the people, even those who feel that there class is horrendously underpowered, would agree that if every suggestion, even every "good" suggestion, was implemented, that the game would be trivialized. In the end, we'd be constantly tuning things up, trying to reach a point where each class felt that they were powerful enough, yet when each individual class was enhanced, other classes would still feel that they get the short end of the stick. <P>Though it's somewhat taking it to extremes, the end result would be a game where every NPC had 1 hitpoint. At that point, every class would finally be immensely powerful, yet the game would be awfully boring.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036520.html"><b>Spell Casting & Animation</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: My character casts all his spells the same way (the same animation for casting). Since we have all these new emotes around, would it be possible to integrate that into the spells?]</i><P> Funny that you should mention that. Keep an eye on the gestures made by some of the higher level casters :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036581.html"><b>NPCs and Taunting</b></a><br>Some NPCs aren't tauntable. However, given the fact that you play on Morell-Thule, I'm pretty certain that you haven't reached many of those yet. <P>Taunt only makes the target hate you slightly more than it hates the next character on the list. It might be advantageous for the person you are trying to taunt the critter off of to back off a bit and let you get a bit of a head start before jumping back in.</UL>

However, maybe a patch update message as well so people who don't come here will know?<br><br><b><i>Yes, I'll be putting one up shortly. Also, anyone ending up in any iksar ending up in a bind/death loop over this issue should /quit, log in another character, and /petition to arrange help out of the situation.<br><br>-Gordon</i></b></uL>Here's the third post:<UL>What about all the dark elf wizards who worship solusek ro? They are KOS in the outpost and the good city. No place to buy spells or get quests on the entire continent of Kunark. There are also dark elf rogues in a similar situation, and possibly some troll and ogre shamans as well.<br>Is this by design,<br> <br><b><i>Yes, this is by design.

A GM has broadcasted that starting tomorrow the Iksar will not be welcomed in any city other than Cabilis.

Despite strong claims by many players stating that Kunark is geared more for high level characters, Brad posted the following on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>Just so everyone knows:<br><br>There are zones for ALL levels in Kunark, 1-60.<br><br>The newbie zones, btw, are certainly more easily accessed by Iksar (who start out in Kunark, of course), but are still accessible by other races.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

EQ Executive Producer Brad McQuaid produced the following post on the Gameplay Board regarding some RoK speed issues:<UL><i>Just to clear up this rumor:<br><br>The trees swaying have NOTHING to do with framerate.<br><br>Two things affect framerate: number of polygons drawn, and fill rate (the number of objects in front of other objects in front of other objects, all of which have to be drawn).<br><br>Framerate goes down in a forest because of the additional polygons needed to respresent all the trees, as well as the trees behind the trees behind the trees having to be drawn.<br><br>Anyway, there are three general ways to increase your framerate (starting from easiest to hardest):<br><br>1. Adjust your clipping plane down under the display options section.<br><br>2. Buy a faster 3D card.<br><br>3. Upgrade your CPU/Computer<br><br>The level of 3D sound can also affect overall framerate, depending on your system's configuration (which sound card, etc.) so you might want to experiment with those settings as well.<br><br>Bottom line, Kunark pushes the EQ engine a lot harder, hence the better visuals. Even though this was perhaps a non-issue for you with the rest of Norrath, when you're on Kunark you might now need to adjust your display settings.<br><br>-Brad<br><br>ps. just to be very clear, the animating trees do not measurably affect your framerate.<br><br>pps. framerate is how fast your screen is updated and has little to do with 'lag', which is generally another word for 'latency' which has to do with internet performance (timing issues, sending data between your client and our servers).  hope that helps :)</i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn had the following to say about the preformance of Kunark hardware-size on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>As Brad mentioned in another thread, the swaying trees really have nothing to do with the framerates that people are getting. What is probably more responsible is the fact that the zones are very large and that we allow you to push your clipping plane out quite far.<br>The beautifully crafted landscapes of Kunark push the abilities of your graphics card and CPU further than the lands shipped with EQ proper. The outdoor zones are also densily populated with NPCs.<br><br>Bringing your clipping plane further in should help the framerate issues. We are also looking into seeing if we can make any further performance tweaks, but the issue is primarily caused by there being so much more to see on Kunark.<br><br>-Gordon</i></ul>
