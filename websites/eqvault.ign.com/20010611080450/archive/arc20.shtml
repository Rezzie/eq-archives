<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
This is today's installment of the Absor Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050113.html"><b>Magicians and Summoning</b></a><br>I know this is gonna be an interesting thread. And I&#8217;ll start it with just one question: <br><br>What new kinds of things would Magicians like to be able to summon? <br><br>And I&#8217;ll end it with a disclaimer: <br><br>This does NOT mean that I am promising that you will see new summoned items in the game! We are just fishing for ideas here, not promising any sort of new stuff. In fact, maybe you should just assume you&#8217;ll never see any of this stuff, just to make it easier on everyone&#8217;s already over-stressed hearts. :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050108.html"><b>"Talk" Threads and Deadlines</b></a><br><br>Well, one a week would mean that we get done in... 10 weeks or so. <br><br>Why? <br><br>And, yes, that deadline is due, at least in part, to internal 'things'. It's just a good time to have things ready. I don't really see a reason to wait until the end of March to have these things looked at. <br><br>And it's not as though I stop reading about or thinking about one class just because we are talking about another at the moment. The thinking and talking is always going on around here.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050103.html"><b>Planetside the EQ-Killer?</b></a><br>Planetside is gonna rock. I plan to play the heck out of it. <br><br>But I'll still play EverQuest. <br><br>I suspect there are a lot of people out there just like me. Well, not too much like me, that would be just nasty... :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050085.html"><b>Attention on Class Issues</b></a><br>I have given no more nor less thought or attention to those other threads as I have to the necromancer thread.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050058.html"><b>Quad Kiting</b></a><br>First, I feel the need to make comments about this whole quad kiting thing. <br><br>ALL I was saying was that I, as a player and a person, don&#8217;t particularly like it as a tactic. As a Verant employee, my intention is to bring that up in a tuning meeting (as MY opinion, not as something that the players want changed). So, please, can we stop all the threads about how bad my idea is? I&#8217;ve got the message already, I know that many of you don&#8217;t want anything done to reduce quad kiting. I&#8217;ve received several e-mails explaining how it is a valid and balanced (from a risk/reward perspective) tactic. I will bring that with me to the meeting when I mention quad kiting, have no fear. And that meeting isn&#8217;t going to be next week, so don&#8217;t panic&#8230; <br><br>I also wanted to talk about a trend that I have been seeing lately. It has probably always been there and I&#8217;ve just been slow to see it. But I have been reading more and more posts wherein people are attacking other people. And it bothers me. <br><br>I have absolutely no problem with people engaging in spirited and even aggressive arguments over ideas or gameplay or any of that. I encourage it. <br><br>But I do not want to see one customer attacking another. I have the responsibility to try to keep this place a forum for talking about EverQuest. For Verant this is one of our main sources for discovering new ideas, areas for improvement, and the general sense of things from our customers. When discussions break down into personal attacks, all that functionality is lost, and bad feelings are generated. Those bad feelings ultimately harm EverQuest and its community. <br><br>I would really like to see a dramatic reduction in personal attacks. I hate having to be the bad guy here, but I will if it becomes necessary. <br><br>Calling other customers &#8216;idiots&#8217; is not acceptable here (or any other form of personal attack). And, if I start seeing an excess of personal attacks on Monday or over the weekend, we will be issuing warnings. <br><br>I don&#8217;t want anyone to feel that we are trying to control topics, or control what you say. But we are willing to control the way you say it. Basically, BE CIVIL TO EACH OTHER. <br><br>Or else&#8230; :)<br><br>As a final note, I want to get through all of the classes with a &#8216;talk&#8217; thread for each before February 9th (or thereabouts). This will be&#8230; well, a mess. I will be trying to start a new one every other day, starting on Monday (looking at a calendar, I may have to do more than three a week&#8230;). <br><br>This will take up a lot of my posting time, I suspect. I think it&#8217;s a good thing for the game, though, so I&#8217;m going to do it. <br><br>Don&#8217;t be expecting instant results on these issues, though. There are always tons of things going on here. And we really want to look at all of these issues as a whole, so I want to get them all done before we dig deeply into them. You might see some of the easy issues resolved right away, and others might not be addressed for a while (and by &#8216;addressed&#8217; I mean either changed or checked off as &#8216;ok as is&#8217;). <br><br>I&#8217;ll do what I can to keep you updated on all that.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050014.html"><b>Quad Kiting Nerf, In Theory</b></a><br>Ok, hang on everyone. <br><br>I only mentioned that _I_ don't like the idea of quad kiting. There is NO official policy about it, I was NOT telling you that it was going to change, I was only telling you that I was planning on bringing it up in a tuning meeting. <br><br>Let's not start acting like I've called in the four horsemen or something. You're starting to make me wonder if I should ever voice any of my personal thoughts again...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049858-2.html"><b>Velious Portal Spells</b></a><br>Yes, they ARE available on vendors.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049929.html"><b>GM Event Thread</b></a><br>Wow. <br><br>A nice post turned into a flame-fest. <br><br>It's good to hear that you had a good time playing. <br><br>For the rest of you... I will, if needed, spend the rest of the day giving out these nice polite warnings: please stop attacking people and talk about ideas.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049979.html"><b>"Non-imbued Ogre War Splintmail can't be worn by Ogres"</b></a><br>Well that would be... just wrong! <br><br>I'll let people know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049674.html"><b>Two Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The new experience changes are great. <br><br>Just raises a few questions in my mind though. <br><br>1) I know that before the patch, race/class experience penalties were distributed across the group. Was this the same for race/class bonuses? <br><br>From what I understand, all class-based penalties are effectively eliminated, and race-based penalties are now felt only by the character, not by the group. <br><br>Which leads to the next question... <br><br>2) If the answer to 1) is yes, are race bonuses, and the bonuses for Warriors and Rogues, now enjoyed solely by the character, when grouped?]</i></font><br><br>The answer to both questions, in short, is yes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049682.html"><b>Server Problems</b></a><br>Some of you have noticed problems with connections to your servers. We are working on something that might resolve those problems.

GameSpot <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2676081,00.html">interviewed EQ Live's associate producer</a> Gordon Wrinn regarding the big changes recently implemented in the last patch.  Here's an excerpt:<UL><b>GameSpot: Can you briefly summarize how most players' experience with the game will change as a result of yesterday's EverQuest patch? </b><br><br>Gordon Wrinn: Generally, most players will be able to advance their characters at a faster rate. <br><br>First, we are dynamically creating "experience," the advancement mechanism in EverQuest, to offset an additional "experience requirement" attached to certain character classes. Secondly, we are creating additional experience to further reward those who adventure in groups. Finally, we are increasing the experience rewards in some areas of the world. <br><br>The overall effect is that some players, depending on style, should be able to advance their characters up to nearly twice as fast as they once could. </UL>

The event has been postponed as <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000352.html">announced recently</a> by Lady Daegarmo on the Arena Board:<UL><I>Greetings Norrathians!<br><br>Due to the fact that Norrath is an ever changing world, both in the universe in which it exists, as well as the fundamental principles of the very physics itself, we continues to grow and evolve. Having a sight that is beyond that of most High Elves, I can see that some very incredible changes are on the horizon for Norrath, and would like to wait for those changes to become reality before advancing into the greatest of all events.<br><br>Test of Tactics II is the largest and most prestigious of all events, also the most difficult to coordinate, organize, and run. Because of this, I was very hesitant in delaying this event, for I know how many are anticipating in competing. In Test of Tactics I, we had over 2000 players participate in the event, as well as countless more who watched it from the floors of the arena, and on the message boards of the <br>land. The Events Staff is expecting some 3500 citizens to be involved in Test of Tactics II, a feat yet unheard of in any book that I have read.<br><br>With these changes coming to the world the day before the event starts, and holding the final release of the rules to make sure they work with current laws of nature, it is unfair to those competing in the event. <br><br>With this lack of practice time for the players, the word "Tactics" becomes obsolete, falling into the realm of the unprepared, waiting for those who participate first to make the errors for others to learn. <br><br>We will be rescheduling Test of Tactics II for Early February, and running the Monks Best of the Best in Late January (Tentatively set for Jan 22nd to Jan 28th) so that the events stay on schedule to represent all classes and 4 Test of Tactics in 2001.<br><br>We look forward to seeing you in the arena!<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Events Supervisor<br>Verant Interactive</I></UL>

The last thing I need is someone quoting me on my stance about the word &#8216;fag&#8217;&#8230; <br><br>But, here I am. <br><br>And the rules for word usage here are pretty darn simple. It&#8217;s all about context. <br><br>If you say that you have had a great day, and you feel gay, I will smile and read on. <br><br>If you say that you are angry at something gay that someone did, I will think about issuing you a warning. <br><br>If you want to talk about your cigar collection, fine. <br><br>I am far more concerned about the impression people are giving with their words than the words themselves. But there are some words that used in most context will always be unacceptable. &#8216;Fag&#8217; and &#8216;gay&#8217; are among those types of word. <br><br>So, hence forth, I&#8217;m going to ask Akriss to start sending out warnings on this sort of thing. If you consider this the wrong decision, or if you think it is wrong of me to try to direct your morality or freedom of speech, I accept that. But I&#8217;m still not going to allow it. <br><br>And, well, I don&#8217;t really want to see any more threads started to talk about this subject either, as most of the time they are just thinly veiled attempts to use &#8216;forbidden&#8217; words without being punished. Talk about how totalitarian I am if you want. But I&#8217;ll be unhappy if I have to issue warnings for things said in those threads that violate the ideas I&#8217;ve mentioned above. <br><br>Like it or not, it is my job to keep things pleasant in here. If I have to do that by sending warnings for childish behavior, I can and will. But I&#8217;d rather be reading threads of import to the community than writing rebuttals about the poor word choice of some people.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049228.html"><b>Censorship</b></a><br>Santerre wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I start a thread stating that Verant, and Abashi in particular, should apologize for shutting down threads on topics like melee binding and xp adjustment.]</i></font> <br><br>And I&#8217;ll answer that. I don&#8217;t think any sort of apology is needed. So, I suppose, I could offer you one, but it wouldn&#8217;t be sincere, and I wouldn&#8217;t want to do that. <br><br>Shutting down threads on topics that are repeated over and over again is still the policy on these boards.

At the time those posts were made, we had no intent of changing the experience system. Continued posting insisting that it be done was disruptive to the intent of these boards. The fact that things have changed now does nothing to affect the need to close posts in the past.

After all, just because you could see it in the dat file does NOT mean it's actually a spell in the game... <br>:)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-2.html"><b>Druid Talk, Part 2</b></a><br>First I want to ask you all to keep within the generally existing mechanics. We&#8217;re looking for balance, but I&#8217;m not going to bring a dozen new spell ideas to the team as a balance tool&#8230; And, realistically, we have to keep the ideas to things that won&#8217;t require a team of artists and programmers to create. <br><br>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve gleaned so far, filtered through my own ideas. <br><br>Healing: <br><br>Druids (and Shaman) want to be better at healing. Not only would this give them a more active roll at the end of the big raids, while at the same time reducing perceived &#8216;need&#8217; for clerics at such times. But we also have to keep in mind that healing is the clerics role, and we do not want to infringe on that role. <br><br>So the proposal is this: <br><br>Move Superior Healing to 49th level. <br><br>Add a new healing spell at 55th level. My suggestion so far is Remedy - a fast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing that won&#8217;t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing spells. <br><br>Maybe add another healing spell at 60th level - perhaps Divine Light (though I&#8217;d rename it&#8230;) <br><br>Reduce the fizzle rate on druid healing spells at the 50+ level. <br><br>More Quests: There have been repeated requests for more mid-level quests for druids. Though this isn&#8217;t really a class balance thing, I&#8217;ll keep it on this list. <br>Charm Animals: For a long time I&#8217;ve liked the idea of a druid being able to charm pets without making them angry. But this also has a ton of gameplay issues attached to it. Keep in mind that the main drawback to charm is that aggro factor. Taking it out would require some other serious drawbacks&#8230; But I&#8217;ve also got that on my list. It should make for some interesting discussions. :)  The idea of making them act like enchanter pets would certainly help. &#8221; How about a High level charm animal spell that only works on animals that con kindly or amiable. If the spell works, it says "The wooly mammoth decides to join you", if it fails it says "The wooly mammoth declines your offer".&#8221; Right, something like that&#8230; :)<br><br>New Druid Rings: I&#8217;m not likely to advocate placing new rings, those require redoing whole zones to get graphics in for them. But some of these ideas might be feasible (I&#8217;m not saying that they are good ideas, just feasible&#8230;): <br><br>If we assume that trees themselves can work as foci for druid travel magics: <br><br>Surefall Glade<br>Warslik Woods<br>Greater Fay OR Lesser Fay <br><br>Form of the mouse! (I&#8217;m only slightly kidding, I like the idea). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Simple: Damage shield damage gets credited to the caster if more than 8 levels above the one being casted upon- same with mages.&#8221;]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I&#8217;ve always wondered why this damage wasn&#8217;t always credited to the caster&#8230; I&#8217;ll ask. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Any chance of treant form?]</i></font><br><br>Hmmm&#8230; just a higher level version of tree form, that would come after wolf form, that is mobile&#8230; Interesting. <br><br>Other new forms aren&#8217;t gonna fly (heh, good pun). As I&#8217;ve said before, I&#8217;d much rather advocate the use of any free space for giving enchanters more forms. <br><br>As for Spirit of Wolf - part II the revenge of the doggie: I&#8217;ll suggest it, but I don&#8217;t anticipate it happening, and I&#8217;m not one that would vote for it. <br><br>Soloing: And, as a note, I&#8217;m not inclined to suggest improvements to the druids ability to solo. Keep in mind that we are encouraging grouping&#8230; <br><br>New looks: this isn&#8217;t a balance issue. But I&#8217;ll bring it up. I wouldn&#8217;t expect any new armor looks to come out as a result. Those kinds of things take a lot of resources to make. <br><br>Class specific armor is too heavy (Vermiculated): This is also something I can ask about. Heavier than warrior armor? <br><br>Elder Spiritist Boots: no component should be needed. <br><br>Faydedar: I&#8217;m pretty sure someone is looking into this beasty and his lifestyle. I&#8217;ll follow up on it. <br><br>Quad Kiting: My personal opinion is that the ability to do this should probably be reduced. I will probably suggest changes that have that effect. Though the only one I&#8217;ve seen (that wouldn&#8217;t also affect the rest of the gameplay for the class) that might work is to reduce the range on AoE spells&#8230; <br><br>NO LURES! Not gonna happen, I tells ya. <br><br>No resurrections either. I don&#8217;t see a need for it at all. <br><br>I admit that after about seven pages I started scanning instead of reading. But most of what I was seeing were repeats of the same requests. I consider that a good sign, really. But if I missed something that you don&#8217;t see above, let me know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049490.html"><b>New Code Bugged Experience and Damage?</b></a><br>LadyMbc wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My lvl 35 mnk is now doing worse in groups than soloing...

Alan was around on the Gameplay Board lot today and discussed many topics:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049194.html"><b>The Word "Gay" Acceptable?</b></a><br>Isladar_PK wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Everyone I have heard in the last few years since high school have always said 'damn that book was gay' or 'my teacher gave me some gay ass homework'. That is just how people talk now!]</i></font><br><br>Right. And that is certainly how the word is used now. But look at the meaning you are giving it. <br><br>In your examples, &#8216;gay&#8217; = &#8216;bad&#8217;. <br><br>But there is a portion of our society that also use &#8216;gay&#8217; to mean homosexual. <br><br>And, therefore, it can be very offensive to some people to simply use &#8216;gay&#8217; to mean &#8216;bad&#8217;. <br><br>So that common usage that you might see every day (I have a good friend that is a schoolteacher, I like to check with him on what&#8217;s hip these days&#8230;), it&#8217;s not polite. Using that word that way you are essentially calling all homosexuals bad. <br><br>I&#8217;m all for bringing back the use of the word gay to mean happy, myself.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049172.html"><b>Druid Talk</b></a><br>Eventually I&#8217;d like to do one of these for every class. I know, your first question is going to be, how did I decide to pick druids to be next? Well, honestly, it just came up in conversation today with a co-worker. There&#8217;s no trick to it. I would certainly address the ones most in need first, but until I&#8217;ve actually done all these posts, I won&#8217;t know which is most in need&#8230; (let&#8217;s not make that the topic of this post, please) <br><br>So the question is, what is it that the druid community thinks they need to become a &#8216;balanced&#8217; class? What is lacking? What is over-powered? - yes, that&#8217;s a valid question for any class &#8211; <br><br>This time I&#8217;m starting this post with very little information to lead with, so I feel like I&#8217;m at a bit of a disadvantage. I do know that, like many other classes, some druids feel that they don&#8217;t have enough to do while at the final encounter of the big raid. One of the suggestions to change that falls along the same lines as one proposed by the shaman community, changing/improving their healing abilities post 50. <br><br>I want you to understand that I think druids are pretty well balanced all around, and I really see little that needs to be changed (and that&#8217;s partially why I picked them to be the topic today&#8230;). So you&#8217;ll have to be convincing, logical and articulate to convince me. :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049165.html"><b>An Apology?</b></a><br>Closing this post for two reasons.

As the three former spells are cast to save a character's life, this solution appears to be the most beneficial for all of those involved.]</i></font> <br><br>We&#8217;re looking at this one again. Due to the fact that at least some of us thought this was going to work one way and other another, we&#8217;ll have to go over it again&#8230; <br><br>But, as it is in game now, Celestial Elixir, Celestial Healing and Torpor will stack with most regenerative-type spells. The will NOT overwrite Call of Bones, Lich or the DoT lifetap spells. The heal over time spells will not take hold on someone with those spell lines up. That&#8217;s how it works at the moment.

It doesn't seem right that we can be pounded but not healed. Half the zone wend LD the other night, and many of us died. Guide would not rez.

When fighting a dangerous opponent and about to lose, players would suddenly go link dead. They would become immune and would be safe from any risk of death. <br><br>But rather than just leaving you in game to suffer as a helpless player character when you go link dead, we&#8217;ve set it up so that you become an non-player character when you go link dead (which is why you can&#8217;t be healed).

It is official, as of today eBay has halted and banned all EverQuest auctions.  I've strongly suspected this change was coming for the last few weeks as hinted in earlier reports.

Today's new patch message is up on the Patch Server:<UL>January 17th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Baltimore Fan Faire - Last Chance*<br><br>Monday is the registration deadline for the Baltimore Fan Faire! We are almost sold out so hurry and visit <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html</a> before you miss your chance to attend this event!<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>The primary focus of today's patch is to implement changes noted in the new Producer's Letter which can be found at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml">http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml</a><br><br>It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you read the Producer's Letter before playing EverQuest.  It contains some unprecedented and exciting enhancements to gameplay.<br><br>In addition to these changes, the following changes have been implemented:<br><br>*Bug Fixes*<br><br>- Fixed a bug that caused "root" and "snare" type spells to function incorrectly when stacked.  They should now stack properly.<br>- Fixed a bug that negated the "instrument modifier" for bards using Selo's, causing them to run slower than they otherwise would. <br>- Fixed a bug that allowed two or more spells that grant levitation to stack.  Levitation spells should not stack.<br>- The "Track Corpse" spell now works.<br>- Tracked down and eliminated several bugs that were causing a very small percentage of people to crash when zoning or upon entering the game.<br>- Fixed a problem with some Ulthork armor that caused it to disappear on death if the wearer was of extremely low level.<br>- Tserrina's Whip has been fixed.  If you received one prior to today's patch, you will need to trade out your whip with a GM in order to get one that works correctly.<br>- Last week's patch attempted to fix Celestial Elixir, Celestial Healing, and Torpor, so that they would stack another similar spell, unintentionally causing it to stop stacking with standard regeneration spells.  This has been fixed.  The downside to this fix is that these spells will now overwrite the "Call of Bones" series.  As the three former spells are cast to save a character's life, this solution appears to be the most beneficial for all of those involved. <br>- The stronger /lootnodrop options will no longer prompt you for confirmation when looting your own corpse.  It is highly suggested that everyone reset their option to the strongest security available: /lootnodrop ALWAYS (always ask for confirmation).<br>- Added some code to address an issue reported by a few players, that being that an NPC named "Ragefire" would die and not leave a corpse.  Though we were unable to reproduce this problem in testing, the code we added should function as a catch-all for this problem.  Please be sure to let us know how this goes.<br><br><br>*Changes/Enhancements*<br><br>- While not mentioned in the Producer's Letter, the Zone Experience Modifier has also been increased in Guk (guktop), by roughly 12%.<br>- "Lay on Hands" has been enhanced again to heal more hitpoints.<br>- Overlooked in the last patch message, new spells were made available to Rangers and Paladins in the upper levels.  <br>- "Voice of the Berserker", a beneficial spell, no longer drains mana over the duration of the spell.<br>- The maximum duration of "Strength of Nature" has been increased.<br>- A new spell for magicians is now available in game.<br>- The "Shield of the Eighth" spell will now last a number of minutes equal to your level.<br>- You can now use the arrow and enter keys to select characters in the character select screen.  In addition, the last character you chose will be automatically hilighted when entering that screen.  This value is stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file as "LastCharSel=0-7"<br>- The ranger's "Trueshot" discipline has had its damage increased after analyzing data from its fix last week.  Prior to the last patch, all bows, while under the discipline, were hitting as if they were 45dmg bows regardless of the delay. Last week's patch fixed it so that damage was based on the damage of the bow.  This weeks patch increases damage bonuses in relation to delay (longer delays yield better damage bonuses). <br>- You can now reverse the left and right channels on your speakers using the /reversesound command.  This should be very useful for those who have had to place their speakers backwards due to cable lengths.<br>- Made some improvements to Paw, Mistmoore, and The Hole, to address some concerns brought forth by the players.  Both zones had some problems that would cause them to be exceedingly difficult in some cases.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Dolar!

Much was talked about on the boards by Alan today.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048612.html"><b>Corpse Poofing and Ragefire </b></a><br>I just wanted to update you all on our research into this whole Ragefire and other corpse poofing thing. <br><br>We&#8217;ve been trying to replicate the poofing of Ragefire, both on Test and on live servers. A lot of tests, using methods provided by players, and we can&#8217;t replicate it. <br><br>However, we are adding some additional catch-all type code that should prevent Ragefire from poofing. That will go in with the patch tonight. <br><br>So I&#8217;d be grateful if you could let me know if you continue to see this happening after the patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048592.html"><b>About Paw</b></a><br>In our campaign to make some areas more appealing, we have increased the experience modifier in Guk Top as well as all the others previously mentioned. Experience in that zone will be increased by about 12%. <br><br>Also, we&#8217;ve made some small changes to Paw that will make it much more player friendly. You&#8217;ll have to check it out to see exactly what was changed, but we think you&#8217;ll like it. <br><br>(heh, note the subtle attempt to convince the players to go to Paw and look at it! I&#8217;m so sneaky.)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048554.html"><b>XP Based on Levels in Groups</b></a><br>Steevin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: For example, I'm a level 45 Bard. I'm grouped with a level 43 Cleric and a level 47 Warrior. We kill a mob worth 10,000XP. How is that divided between the three of us, and why?]</i></font><br><br>Well, the nice thing about the changes happening tonight is that it&#8217;s now very easy to tell what portion of the experience you will gain from a group. I&#8217;ll use your example: <br><br>Total levels = 135<br>Total experience given = 10,000 <br><br>The 45th level character (it does not matter what class he is) will get 45/135*10,000 experience, that&#8217;s 3,333 (DO NOT ask me to tell you how the experience system rounds off, I&#8217;m not going to even ask about it&#8230;) <br><br>The 43rd level character will get 43/135*10,000 = 3,185 <br><br>And the 47th level character will get 47/135*10,000 = 3,481 <br><br>Let&#8217;s check the math: 3,333+3,185+3.481= 9,999&#8230; ok, I lost a point someplace&#8230; <br><br>But, basically, the only thing you will need to take into consideration if you are worrying about experience distribution when choosing group members is their level.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048512.html"><b>Class Balance</b></a><br>Tween wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Aradune said in the Producer's Letter that doing away with the class experience penalties brings them one step closer to class balance. He also said that, though 100% of the population will never be able to agree that the classes are balanced, they hope to bring them all to a point soon where the largest issues are offset by other advantages... or something like that.]</i></font> <br><br>That&#8217;s very accurate. <br><br>Basically, we feel that the classes are very close to balanced. Heck, one of the main things that was out of balance was the class experience charts. But just because we&#8217;ve fixed that does not mean we are done. We may move slowly, but we will get there. No class is &#8216;closed&#8217; for changes and adjustments. We want to reach that point sooner rather than later. But we&#8217;ll let you know when we feel we are there.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048476.html"><b>Fishing Nerfed!</b></a><br>I just don't know if I should laugh or cry...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048252-3.html"><b>Changes an Insult to Hybrid Classes?</b></a><br>Ovilian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How many of you flaming morons have actually played a hybred. Yes the bred comes from breed not brid, idiot. The reason I am complaining is because this is a complete ripp-off.]</i></font> <br><br>Firstly, the spelling is hybrid, not hybred, regardless of your claims to the contrary. <br><br>And, while I usually don&#8217;t justify such overly nasty posts with responses, someplace in there you have a legitimate point. <br><br>We talked a bit about this reaction. We knew that some customers would probably feel a bit cheated by this change. Some of you have indeed played up to a high level under the auspices of the experience charts, and the fact that we are effectively evened those charts might seem to somehow cheapen your accomplishment. <br><br>But keep in mind that, since release anyway, a hybrid has never paid the cost of his or her experience chart whenever grouped. That burden was always placed on his group. So it is hard for me to accept any argument about how we have somehow reduced the value of the accomplishment made by a hybrid to level, except for those that helped him getting those levels. And there really is no way that I can think of that we could give those lost experience points back to the group members that help you earn them. <br><br>My apologies for the slight sarcasm there, but I felt it was warranted. <br><br>What we have done, though, is made it so that from this day forward, no group will be able to exclude you because you cost them experience points. I think this far outweighs any perceived slight or loss of esteem that might or might not come from this change. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You morons are missing the point&#8230;]</i></font> <br><br>I need to ask you to stop calling people names. This is something that we do not allow on these boards. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We earned our levels unlike you, through deaths, corpse runs, and being turned away from groups because of our class.]</i></font> <br><br>The only way that you mention in which you actually had a harder time than anyone else is in finding groups. This is what we are fixing with this patch&#8230; <br><br>Sterol_sk said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I mostly agree with the original poster, verant needs to find some way to REWARD all 50+ hybrids for basically playing a broken game for the past two years.]</i></font> <br><br>I&#8217;m honestly baffled by this. Unless you soloed your way up to 50+, it was not you that paid the penalty for our &#8216;broken&#8217; game, it was your group members. <br><br>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I can tell you that I truly do see how you might feel somewhat&#8230; let down (I guess that&#8217;s the right word)&#8230; about how we are changing this so late in your gameplay. I really do, I think all of us do. But despite the reality of that feeling, not all feelings are based on logic. Yes, every time you soloed you were struggling against a larger experience chart than others. But when you grouped you were benefiting from that chart while your group struggled under it. <br><br>I&#8217;m not saying that your feelings are wrong, feelings can&#8217;t really be wrong. But I&#8217;m asking you to see the bigger picture. I know that most of you want this change far more than you want to hold on to any feeling of having earned your high experience cost levels. And be assured that we understand that feeling (not a few of us play hybrids here, to high level as well). <br><br>icebreakerDarkmoore <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ovilian your a selfabsorbed idiot..]</i></font> <br><br>Again, let&#8217;s lay off the name calling. If, for some reason, you think that calling him names is acceptable just because he had a nasty tone to his post, you are incorrect. I didn&#8217;t read all the posts here in detail, but the same warning goes for all that have done this. And, well, I&#8217;m going to close this thread since it has degenerated into a bit more of a name-calling contest than I like. If someone wants to continue the pertinent parts of this discussion in a new thread, please do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048475-2.html"><b>More on Huge Changes</b></a><br>Qwase wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ok, just a question. <br>If I have my friend the 56 SK go a die like 50 times, and wait to res him after the patch. Will he get extra XP since his lost XP will be calculated with diferent numbers?]</i></font><br><br>Sorry, no. We thought of that one too, and we&#8217;re making sure that doesn&#8217;t happen. :)  You will get experience upon resurrection based on the way you were receiving experience on death. So if you die before the patch, resurrection after the patch will give you the same experience return that it would have before the patch. <br><br>Drysart wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I believe they've said the new experience system is up on the Test Server right now.]</i></font><br><br>/em waves at Drysart <br><br>Yup.

Hazarding a guess I'd say druids and necromancers, but I'd like to know for sure.]</i></font><br><br>Actually, we&#8217;ve decided to leave the two classes that had bonuses (warrior and rogues) as they were. <br><br>Saeul said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is still penalty for soloing imposed on all classes except warriors/rogues, but that penalty is now very small (~10%??).]</i></font><br><br>Nope. The &#8216;penalty&#8217; is completely gone. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you group or not, there will no longer be any more experience needed for one class over another, with the exception of the Warrior and Rogue, which will get a slight bonus. The experience change for hybrids and other over-costed classes is a separate thing from the group experience bonus. <br><br>Mai029 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think these changes are great Now I can finally have my Pally shout out for a group and not be responded by the ominous sound of Crickets chirping.]</i></font><br><br>Verant is unfair to crickets.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047576.html"><b>Why can't Y= Yes and N= No? </b></a><br>I'll mention the Y or N thing.

Several new articles were posted today in a variety of sections here at the EQVault:<UL><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid979684743,53286,"><b>The State of Healing in the Post 50 Game</a> - By Rolli Polli </b><br>On one hand we have druids and shamans who say that their heals are inadequate for fighting creatures that can do 200 points of damage a swing, and usually double or triple hit. The only way to successfully fight creatures like that is to have a cleric periodically cast complete healing on a warrior. In one extreme example, three shamans that were all level 53 to 60 could not provide the healing power of one 50th level cleric. The reason is that the 53rd level healing spell, superior heal, fizzles a great deal making it ineffective and the only other option is the 29th level healing spell, greater heal. Any shaman or druid trying to keep up with the healing requirements of a post 50 group would soon be out of mana. If you&#8217;re in Sebilis and the group&#8217;s cleric has to go, everybody else might as well leave too. So druids and shamans need better healing spells.<br><br><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid979685073,17227,"><b>Soulfire Chapters 1-4</a> - By Roger Wright </b><br>&#8220;She was turned, infected with the curse of the wolf, made into a werewolf. There is only one way to free her.&#8221; Nyxx laid the large scroll down on the table and tried to unroll it but her hands would not cooperate. Kel gently moved her hands aside and carefully unrolled the scroll. On the scroll was the face of a beautiful woman dressed in a beautiful gossamer gown. She was a striking woman. The hair on Samadhi&#8217;s neck stood straight up and he closed his eyes. Padmai took a sharp breath and her hand moved to cover her mouth. Tyrus looked at the woman and tried to think of something to say but could not find the words.<br><br>&#8220;Oh God Nyxx, who is she?&#8221; Mightyd&#8217;s words were no longer full of fun, rather his voice was strained and serious. The other members of the Oasis glanced at each other hoping against hope there were wrong. Nyxx paused and choked back her words, she took a deep breath and continued.<br><br>&#8220;She is my mother.&#8221; <br><br><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid979684308,24960,"><b>Chapter 3: Clarity</a> - By Vince</b><br>The lithe elf stepped through a semi-transparent portal, scintillating<br>colours exploding outwards in all directions. Almost instantaneously, the portal faded to nothing and a final clap of thunder could be heard, seemingly miles away. Alaric stood for a moment, his fists clenched so tightly the whiteness of his knuckles showed. He roared in anger, spun on his heel and sent his right fist crashing into the wall of the cave.  Smaller pieces of rock fell from the hole, small cracks appearing left and right of the blow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid979684043,83199,"><b>A Dark Angel</a> - By Kymera</b><br>~The door swings open and the guard enters the house. The interior is dimly lit, but he has no problem seeing. His Teir'Dal eyes scanned the room, taking in the herbs hanging from the rafters, the jars with scrawled writings on the shelves, the tables covered with books, and other arcane items, looking for a place to lay his burden. Seeing a small table, almost empty, he moves to it, and after Klaryssa clears it, he opens his cloak and removes the two squirming bundles.~<br><br>"What in Innoruuk's name have you brought me, Fachon?" the witch says as she moves closer and raises her candle. As the guard opens the bundles, she gasps and steps back.<br><br>"They are the children of Lord D`Sade, who is, as we speak, torching his very house and slain wife in a mad rage. The female was born first, and he could not see past that in his rage. He killed her, and almost the boy child. I heard, and while he ran to fetch the torch, I took them, and brought them here."<br><br>"You have gone against the very Fates, Fachon!

Electric Games has their <a href="http://www.electricgames.com/reviews/e/everquestsov.html">review of Velious</a> up and online.  They award the second EQ expansion with a 4/5 star rating.  Here's the bottom line according to the reviewer:<ul>New graphics effects and interface are excellent. The layout of the zones are designed to force the player to use much more strategy than before. The pack is for mid to high level players seeking a challenge. Low level or casual players will not get nearly enough, if any, benefit from this expansion. </ul>

This report was brought to us by Cadsuane Meladhrin:<blockquote> While on a forray into the filthy lair of the Splitpaw gnolls to obtain spells for our necromancers today, we encountered an Iksar monk by the name of Master Vyyth Swiftscale deep in the bowels of the dungeon.  He beseeched us to aid him in locating the paladin Brother Hayle so he could be 'freed'.<br> <br> While some were weary about aiding a follower of Cazic Thule on such a benevolent mission, we agreed anyway, if for no other reason that to find out the Iksar's true motives.  Upon arriving at the entrance to the jail holding the Qeynos paladin, he made his those intentions clear:  He was to destroy Brother Hayle.  Being an open-minded group of adventurers we decided to listen to his motives before making the decision on whether or not to aid him.  He sat down and told us a story of a pact of Gods and betrayal (the log of which I will have linked up shortly).  Being Gods with similar motives, he explained a secret pact made between Innoruuk and Cazic, overseen by the Tribunal, to spread the glory of the deities across the face of Norrath.  This began with the opening of terror in the Kithicor Woods and was to continue with the razing of Qeynos.  To this end, Cazic Thule sent his son as an avatar to give him the city.  This son was Brother Hayle.  Overcome by fear, Brother Hayle decided to turn his back on his father, and sided with the Paladins of Qeynos, becoming one of them.  Enraged by this turn of events, Cazic Thule banished his son to the festering cave of Infected Paw.  However times are changing, and Brother Hayle's death has become necessary to fulfill the pact made by Cazic Thule and Innoruuk.<br> <br>After hearing his story we were shocked.  Everyone's reaction was different.  The paladins stalwartly insisted that no harm come to Brother Hayle.  The Iksar and Tier'Dal viewed his death as a holy mission, and the key to unleashing the glory of their deities onto the face of Norrath. Worshippers of Fizzlethorpe could not see past the irony of the situation, thinking it all a great joke.  The godless among us scoffed at the entire situation, disdaining meddling in the affairs of the supposed 'Gods'.<br> <br>In the confusion that ensued, Master Vyyth ran for the jail.  The paladins and others attempted to block his entry into the cell, bodily, but the slippery lizard managed to dart past them.  It was then that Brother Hayle was confronted and defeated by Master Vyyth, along with some present, as others watched in horror, knowing they were powerless to save the paladin.<br><br>Master Vyyth left with cryptic words of returning to the Plane of Fear to report to his Master.  One can only speculate at what, if anything, may arise from these developments.  Only time will tell.<br> <br>A synopsis and pictures can be found at our guild webpage <a href="http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~gte178n/index.html">http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~gte178n/index.html</a><br> <br>--Cadsuane Meladhrin<br>43rd Cleric of Innoruuk<br>Officer [Bad Faction]</blockquote>Thanks!

They are contradicting themselves."]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, that's simple. <br><br>You'll notice that even before the proposed changes to the way experience is given, people were playing more costly classes. Why? <br><br>Because they wanted to. <br><br>We've been working very hard to balance the classes. Therefore losing the experience penalty for them makes sense. We've made no effort, nor do we plan to as far as I know, to 'balance' the classes, expect by use of their experience penalty. <br><br>I really don't think that the existing experience cost for races will keep people from playing those races, where the combination of race AND class experience costs could certainly have done so. <br><br>And, really, the essence of this whole thing is that there is a reason to balance the races with extra experience costs, and there is no reason to do so for the classes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047824.html"><b>Absor Responsible For Big Changes?</b></a><br>Evangolis wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Since Absor has started his job, Verant has introduced the most sweeping changes seen since beta, many of them completely unexpected. <br><br>Therefore, based on available evidence, that must be Absor's responsibility. <br><br>Note - I'm being sarcastic here. I doubt any one person at Verant can claim sole credit for the major changes we have seen this last month. But I think some of the credit probably does go to Absor."]</i></font><br><br>If only that were true... <br><br>I've had my say on those changes, sure. But few of them were my idea (especially not the coolest ones). I really wish I could take credit for all of this stuff, but I can't. I can say that I've been cheering on those with the best ideas, if that counts. <br><br>To answer the original question, a lot of what I do is run down people to ask questions about specific concerns that the players have brought up. And, sadly, a lot of it is simply trying to understand those concerns and write them up in the most coherent way I can. But the largest use of my time is reading. These boards, class boards, fan sites... <br><br>There's a lot of players out there, and a lot of them are trying to make themselves heard. I try to make sure that I've read as many of those concerns as I can. <br><br>Perhaps speed reading classes would be a good use of my free time. :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047421.html"><b>Guild Purge</b></a><br>You should contact your GM about the problem with your guild.

Failure to do so, could result in the offender being reported to the Militia, or worse. <br><br>If you happen to encounter the enchanter, DO NOT attempt to apprehend the individual, DO NOT approach him/her, DO report to the nearest Phantom Guard checkpoint. <br><br>-Sir Lucan of Freeport- <br><br>/ooc<br>Greetings all.<br>I am pleased to announce that the Phantom Guard, Winterblood and Illumanati will be hosting a roleplaying event in East Freeport on Saturday the 20th at 3 PM EST, we hope that many people will partake in this event. So if you are hailed by a Dark Elf and ordered to identify yourself, then either play along or just let us know that you are not a roleplayer. <br><br>Should there be anyone who would want to play a greater part in the event (read: assist the occupational forces), please e-mail me, post a reply here, or post on the guild message board at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/eqphantomguard/home.htm">http://www.geocities.com/eqphantomguard/home.htm</a> <br><br>Hope to see you there <br><br>-Elhimac-<br>-Phantom Guard Commander-<br>-mmosgaard@12move.dk- </blockquote>Thanks!

Brad McQuaid, who from the looks of it likes working on 3 day weekends ;), fired off a post on the Gameplay Board <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047827.html">concerning server population issues</a>:<UL><i>Hi all,<br><br>I wanted to bring up this issue officially and also talk about some aspects of it, and how we are looking to solve some of the issues.<br><br>First of all, we are working to come up with a new target server population at peak hours number. Our inclination at this point is a number somewhere between 2300 and 2500 players during peak hours. We feel we need to adjust this number because of how much Velious has added to EverQuest's size and quantity of content.<br><br>We also feel that undercrowding is probably more detrimental to the game than overcrowding, in that while crowded areas are frustrating in that there is greater competition involved, there are some advantages to it (help from others when an encounter goes bad, help with CRs, etc.). (No, I'm not saying Overcrowding is good overall -- so please don't misunderstand me). Undercrowding, however, can mean a player can't find anyone to play with, and thus leaves. In other words, that frustration can be worse.<br><br>There have also been some problems with packet loss and link death, specifically on E'Ci, when populations are growing high.<br><br>So, what are we going to do about all of this? <br>Well, before launching new servers we're going continue to analyze where players are at, what zones are crowded, and what zones are underused. Significant experience bonuses are going in next patch for underused zones (mostly dungeons). <br><br>With E'Ci specifically we found out that after a recent hardware change, the network interface was incorrectly configured -- last night this was fixed, so please tell us if anything has improved.<br><br>Also, when there are network problems out there with the Internet and a large group of players go link dead, this can cause zones to go down. We are working on this issue as well.<br><br>So, there you have it, both gameplay and hardware solutions we hope will have significant effect. And please understand that any hesitation to launch new servers is due to undercrowding fears only -- if after these adjustments and attempts to better utilize all the zones we have it turns out target populations are lower than we believed, we will launch new servers, both split and new.<br><br>thanks, and we look forward to your comments and feedback.<br><br>-Brad</i></ul>

Brad McQuaid and Gordon Wrinn announced monumental changes to the world of EverQuest this evening on the Gameplay Board.  The post weighs over 5 pages and it is <b>highly recommended</b> that you read it all, as it will affect everyone in some way.  Because of it's length, and at the request of Gordon, I will only be posting the intro and summary in this post.  For the complete read <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840.html"><b>please click on this link</b></a>.<br><br>Here's the intro:<ul><i>Hi all,<P>The following is the new Producer's Letter, which will be posted to everquest.com on Tuesday.  I wanted to get it up on the message boards sooner so you all can get the word out, and because you guys are where we get most of our feedback and deserve a little advanced info now and then   :)<P>These are BIG changes, and are a summary of reactions to months of thought and a ton of feedback.  I don't think we've made changes this fundamental since beta, so cross your fingers and read on:<P>---------------<P>January 14, 2001<P><br>Hello all,<P>Since the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious, the EverQuest Live team has been working on a number of things, from addressing issues in Velious to adding additional content to other portions of the world.  At this same time, we've been working towards a point where we can stop tweaking class-based abilities, and declare with confidence that they are as "balanced" as we can make them.<P>It is a foregone conclusion that the diversity of EverQuest's population will never let us reach a point where everyone will be perfectly satisfied with their class's abilities, as nearly every change we make tends to bother some people while pleasing others.  Still, we are confident that we can reach a point where problems in our current game systems can be reduced to the point that those left are either negligible in their impact, or offset inversely by a similar problem affecting gameplay in an opposite direction.  We're nearly there, but following heated debate and the review of material and opinions sent in by the players, we've decided to make some exciting and unprecedented changes to a game system that has remained intact since release:  the experience system itself.  <P>While the EverQuest Message-board FAQ states that the experience system is not subject to post-production changes, it also explains that as developers of an ongoing MMORPG in a dynamic world, there are times that we need to be flexible and address issues as necessary.  Though it has always been our goal to avoid changes to core systems whenever possible, our additional goal of finalizing class balance takes precedence in this case.  <br> <br>We're going to depart from our usual method of releasing information by giving everyone some specific information in regards to how these systems currently work, and how they will work after the patch.  It is very important to us that everyone understands our goals, and the fact that these changes are helpful to all of the players.  We can only do that by giving you the details necessary for you to draw your own conclusions.</i></ul>As I stated, this is a gigantic read.  I recommend that you read it, but for those who don't have time or just want the details quick here's the summary Gordon provided:<ul><P><b>Summary</b><P>The changes that we are making in the next patch should have a profound impact upon the game:<br><blockquote><ul><br><li>Classes no longer have a true class-based experience penalty, making it easier for people to play the class that they want to play, rather than the class that they feel compelled to play due to faster advancement.  </li><P><li>Race based penalties are no longer shared with the group, and in truth are not severe enough to greatly impact the advancement speed of any particular race.  Even the race with the worst penalty will level no slower than a human monk does now, and in truth will level faster due to the other changes that went in.  </li><P><li>The grouping bonus increase, in addition to the other changes, makes grouping much more efficient, without reducing the current efficiency of soloing for those who prefer that route.</li><P><li>Experience modifiers turned up in the other zones should encourage people to spread out, have more fun, and allow those staying behind in other areas to have more fun themselves since the area is less crowded.</li><P><li>All players, assuming that they have an experience penalty, or ever group with anyone who does, will level faster.</li><br></ul></blockquote><br>Many of these changes are quite involved in regards to their implementation, and as such we want to be sure that everyone interested understands them.  Alan "Absor" VanCouvering will be happy to answer any questions that you may have on the EverQuest Message boards.  Until then, we sincerely hope that these changes will help all players, whether "uber" or "causal", experience and enjoy EverQuest to their greatest potential. <P>For Brad McQuaid, Jeff Butler, and every dedicated member of the EverQuest Team,<P><br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Associate Producer, EQLive<br>Sony Online Entertainment</ul>

Anyone found attacking a GM or Guide may be banished from the Arena or death touched without warning. <br><br>The Arena is off limits to unauthorized PvP 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after the event. This is to ensure that the contestants and spectators are safe. <br><br>Spectators shall remain seated and not casting during the match. Any spell casting shall be considered aimed at a participant, and either harmful or helpful to someone in the match. Anyone who casts any spells (including Bard songs) during a match can be death touched and removed from the Arena. <br><br>Spectators shall not use /shout for any reason, but use /ooc instead. This is so that those involved in the match use /shout, and the channel can be turned off to reduce distraction to the contestants involved. Use of /shout at anytime can result in a silence command being issued, rendering the player unable to use any form of communication, or banishment from the Arena. <br><br>Spectators shall not interfere with this event. Severe penalties are used only when directly attacking a player involved in the match, attacking a judge during the match, or healing a player involved in a match. <br><br>VI may limit the amount of people in the zone to control conditions of lag or frame rate for the participants. The event shall start open seating, but may close off at any time. The Event Staff may use any sort of decision on who stays and who leaves to ensure the event is a success. This should not be implemented until a minimum of 150 players in the zone has been reached. <br><br>AoE Spells ARE allowed in game. This has the potential of killing off some of the younger spectators, if you are killed by one of these spells please pull corpse out of the PvP area and await for a GM or guide to give you a res.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Combatant Rules <br><br><br>An entry fee of 5,000 platinum pieces will be required per 7 man teams. Money is to be giving to an Event Coordinator and is due before the first match. Teams may waive the fees with the understanding of waiving the prizes. <br><br>7 Man teams can be made up of any races/class combination of levels 52 or greater. Only 6 may compete per match and teams may switch out any team member for the 7th player between matches. The 7th man out is free to coach his teammates from the side lines/top of throne and will be allowed to use any in game channels to do so. <br><br>Spells that are NOT allowed: Fear, Charm, and any Gravity Spells. Knock back spells ARE allowed. <br><br>With an exception to items with activatable properties, all items, weapons, and armor will be allowed in this event. Activatable items of any kind may only be used for stat bonuses and processes. The right clickable effects are prohibited and will result in disqualification if used. <br><br>In the event that the combat exceeds 30 minutes of RL time then the Event Staff will cast an AoE Snare spell in the direct center of the platform every 2 minutes until the combat is over. <br><br>The top of the throne is off limit to the combatants during the matches, the only people that may use the top of the throne are the 7th person of the teams and any press that are allowed to witness the match.<br><br>Any use of exploits or bugs will result in immediate disqualification from the event, and is a break in the rules of conduct as set forth on www.everquest.com. <br><br>Rallos Zek Specific Rule : There shall be no looting of any item at an event, this includes spectators. Anyone found player killing for profit at an event shall have action taken against their account. <br><br>Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek Rule : You may request to have your faction restored to the condition it was in at the last available save. This is to ensure that no unnecessary faction hits are taken at an event.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Test Server Finals <br><br>Those champions who go to Test are bound by additional rules: The character used for the event cannot adventure on Test for any reason. Handing off even the smallest items to a player on Test is considered duplication, resulting in a warning against the account, and loss of that item on your home server. Those found extremely abusing this rule can have further actions taken against the account at the discretion of the EQ development team. <br><br>The transfer of characters to Test is midnight (give or take an hour) PST the night before the main event. <br><br>Lake Rathetear will be shut down several hours before the main event. The only characters allowed in the Arena on Test for the main event will be the champions, the judges of the event and the event staff, other members of Verant Interactive, and members of the press who signed up with Lady Daegarmo at least three days in advance via email. <br><br>All other characters on test found in the Arena during the main event will be summoned out of the zone and bound so they cannot return. If a second character is found to enter the Arena for any reason, it could be considered disruption and subject to action taken against the account. <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Lady Daegarmo, Ozzmar, Dartok</i></UL>
