Moving straight on to the Gordon Infobits, here's all of Gordon Wrinn's current posts on the Gameplay board:<UL><LI><a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030672.html><b>The Hole</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: "We want people do 'do' dungeons instead of camp"<br>-Verant <P>The following is an proposal for the zone called "The Hole", which I feel would add a much needed level of excitement and skill to the mid-level Everquest game. <P>We've all heard of the Planes, the high-level, ultra-hard zones that require teamwork, efficiency, and have some lovely loot. However, being level 46-50 is not something that we can all experience, sadly. <P>Now, most of us have heard of Hell Levels. They are a result of a mathematical inaccuracy in the experience tables that require you to gain a lot more experience than intended to level up. 30, 35, 40, and 45 are by definition, "Hell Levels". <P>What I propose is a place where mid-level characters could get pre-plane experience in a similar environment, a high-risk, high-reward dungeon that would be open for mid-level people only. There would be more experience per mob killed due to difficulty and to make leveling through Hell a bit easier. Of course, people die in The Hole, so, as I said, it's Risk vs. Reward. <P>The zone could be open for players level 34-41, which encompasses 2 hell levels, 35 and 40, respectively. The limits are in place so that the people intended to be there are there, no high-level campers, no powerlevelers. <P>The loot would be nice. Something for every class, I hope. Specifically, I would like to see a Shadowknight weapon of Ghoulbane strength if not better. Components for nice quests could be found here, perhaps some rare poison for the rogues, a new spell for the casters. Wouldn&#8217;t you like to see a spell earned instead of bought? <P>In a nutshell, the entire point of this proposed Hole is a proving ground for sub-planar characters. It&#8217;s to get them off their camping arses and into a big, scary Hole. I&#8217;m done now, but below were several other ideas I considered, that may or may not be &#8220;over the top&#8221; for something like this. <P>OTHER IDEAS- <P>The Screams of Pain- Based on a random timer that spans at least 6 hours, every so often a high-pitched screaming noise can be heard coming from the depths of the Hole. This quickly acts as a warning to any people currently adventuring in there, as they have 60-80 seconds after the screams begin to act. When the 60-80 seconds are gone, full zone repop. This does two things,<P>a. Makes the dungeon even more challenging, scary, and unexpected.<P>b. Prevents camping and farming of the Hole. The intention is to earn what you get down here; respawn camping is lame. <P>The Boss- The Hole is a physical hole ripped from Norrath in a great war of magics. The &#8220;Boss&#8221; mob should be tough enough to reflect this. Since the proposed level range for the players is somewhat large (7), balancing a Boss is difficult. Making it too high would make casters useless unless they were about to leave the zone (upon reaching the higher limit). Level is really just a number, so a level 38 Boss buffed to ungodly amounts for that level. Cazic Thule, Inoruuk, and the Dragons reportedly have 32,000 HP, so I would think that around 14,000 would not be unreasonable. <P>The Boss Room, an alternative to The Boss- The &#8220;Boss Room&#8221; would be very unique, and if possible would greatly enhance the experience. For every person in The Hole (about 30 for an average raid, let&#8217;s say), then there are 1/6 mobs created. If there are 30 people raiding, there are 5 monsters, very tough. Buffed to extremes, but not quite as much as The Boss. They would vary in class and loot. Of course, I don&#8217;t know if the technology exists to allow this kind of spawning. <P>The Boss, part II!- In an effort to torment players, Bruce Springsteen music is repeatedly played while in the zone. As you break the zone, jam to the classics like &#8220;Born in the USA&#8221;, and &#8220;Glory Days&#8221; The Boss is The Boss himself, a quad-hitting bard in a leather jacket. (I&#8217;m sorry, couldn&#8217;t say Boss that many times without somebody talking about Mr. Springsteen, so I went ahead and did it for you.) <P>That about wraps it up. Please give your input on this. Personally, I&#8217;m sick of camping, let&#8217;s make something new. Thanks for reading, and good night.]</i><P>These are some interesting ideas. I'll forward them to the world-builder as well as the people who'll be responsible for populating the zones. <P>Though I can't comment on any of the specifics of how this zone will be designed, I can say that the dungeons that have been built since release have been designed with the knowledge of how players in the game react to certain encounters. I would say that the dungeons built since release are all *better* in that regard.<P><LI><a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030720.html><b>On Mages</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Thanks for looking into phantom armor. Would it be possible to change the name to "summonedleather/chain/plate" for role playing sake when you rework it? [it would be wonderfull if it wasmade conj as well, butI know it won't happen]]</i><P>We still like the 'Phantom' name. The regen component that we are adding to the spells might not fit 'Phantom' too well, but at least it sounds cool. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Voicegraft, please? It's a RP spell plain and simple and wouldn't affect balance at all.]</i><P>I'll mention it to GZ :)<P><i>[Quote from original post: 3) The spear of warding / sword of runes lost there procs sometime in jan. Was this intentinal? Any plans to be fixed/replaced?]</i><P> Talking to one of the item guys about it now. Does it just "not proc", or does it say something like "Item is out of charges"? <P><i>[Quote from original post: 4) At some point there was a silent change in that damage shields cast on pets do not last 3x as long as on people anymore(which hurts your mana-efficenticy a bit when soloing). I had allways thought that the effect was a bug [as damage shields last forever on most mobs], but a silent nerf like this is still a bit disheartning. Was that the case?]</i><P> NPCs were treating buff spells differently than PCs. The point was to keep NPCs in cities from constantly casting buffs on everyone and everything. Though this part of the code was maintained, special code was put in so that buffs would wear off of pets at the proper time. We probably should have announced this. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 5) GZ once said that summoned items are no-rent because you don't want them to have unlimited effect with a 1 time mana investment, and that if there was some limit on how much say a sword of runes could be used it would be rentable. Then could all consumable summoned items loose the no-rent flag? Waterstones, ammo, food/water & the ring of flight, come to mind. Pockets, weapons coldstones ect are all fine as no-rent.]</i><P> We don't have a way to put a time-limit on items, beyond either making them NORENT for the term of a login session, or until you zone, so changing this really isn't an option at this point. It does have the added benefit of requiring that people seek out someone to summon their items every time they log in. Take the dimensional pouch as an example. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 6) Could invis to undead be added to the air elemenatl's invisibilty spell?]</i><P> I'm sorry, but the ability to be invis to both the living and the dead is and will remain a rogue-only ability. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Best solution : "Voice of Zomm" - Allows a mage to dirrectly order his elementals moves for a period of 30 seconds, just like the eye, only works *only* with an elemental. [Yes, that's a long rant about one insignificant spell. Give a mage 3 ways to cast a spell and they start to think it should be usefull/fun]]</i><P> Good point, I'll mention it to GZ. I'm not sure if this would be possible with limited coding however. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 8) At what level do focus items begin to affect your elementals?]</i><P> We leave things like this to the players to figure out. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 9) Whas making all the pets delay uniform [after the duel wield patch] intentionial or a bug? Will this be changed?]</i><P>When we finally allowed them to start dual-wielding, we had to reevaluate the differing attack speeds. We found them to be too powerful overall. Rest assured that your pets are more powerful than they were before since they dual-wield now. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 10) Known bug - Burning out or fire-shielding an invisible elemental often results in it becomeing *permentily* invis.]</i><P> This must be a real pain for PvP. I'll send this one to the test team to be sure that it is in the database. <br>--<br>Follow up: <P>We found the problem with the Sword of Runes, and it should be fixed the next time we do data. As for the spear of warding, it doesn't have a proc and never has according to our records.<P><LI><a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030868.html><b>Gameplay Engine Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why is it that when you are inside a cottage, house or building creatures can attack you through the wall even though you cant see them. This basically means in places like East Karana you cant take refuge almost anywhere. Why shouldnt you be able to get in a house and hide w/o a lion invisibly attacking you through the wall? this applies to griffins and other creatures as well. Other buildings in other zones too!]</i><P> Not really a bug. In order to reduce the amount of "lag" that can happen due to internet latency, then engine handles object collisions client-side. Most houses and such are objects (rather than world geometry) and are subject to this. <P>It also has the benefit of eliminating a good number of issues that would have to be dealt with in order to limit possible exploitation. For instance, if this wasn't the case, someone could sit inside a house and cast upon a creature that couldn't fit through the open door.<P><LI><a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030861.html><b>Corpse Decay</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I had a corpse with almost all my stuff on it when the servers came down yesterday. Do I loose all the stuff I had on it?]</i><P> Corpses above level 5 remain for 24 online hours or one week offline, whichever occurs first. In other words, your corpse should be fine.<P><LI><a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030870.html><b>Spellcaster Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I see right now that you have some GREAT spells for necros. No matter what criticism you get, keep them this way. You have kept wizards bad, no reason not to keep necros good.]</i><P>Like other spell issues, we still can't comment on them. But I think it might be prudent to remind everyone that anything we put in will be balanced. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Also, being a former wizard, I was inclined to check out their spells. The alleged wizard pet spell on lvl 59, Flaming Sword of Xuzl...when you kick the letters in Xuzl back 6 places it spells "ROTF"....Bad joke, guys...]</i><P> ROFL! Or should I say Xulr!<P><LI><a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030871.html><b>Clerics and Ressurection</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: This may be a pointless topic, but how can clerics ressurect themselfs after they died?  Its like having your own corpse ressurect you while your dead. anyone agree?]</i><P> From a fairness standpoint, we decided to allow this. If we didn't, in single cleric parties, the cleric would be the only one subject to full XP loss on death. </UL>

Verant's President himself, John Smedley, spent some time on the Gameplay Board addressing a few issues and questions the players had:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030674.html"><b>The Nameless Problems</b></a><br>ok.. I'm going out on a limb here, but we could win the lottery with the kinds of odds it would take for this server to have a problem again.

I've carefully considered many of the arguments that people are making regarding this issue. <P>We've decided to put up a Poll tomorrow in EverQuest. The poll will read:<P>-------------------<br>Are you comfortable with the EverQuest client checking to see if you are running programs that are capable of cheating in EverQuest and reporting that back to our servers? <P>No? <br>Yes?<br>--------------------- <P>Note that I put the No first (to counter the argument that people just click on the first thing they read). <P>I think in a case like this it's prudent for us to check with our userbase before we make this level of a change. <P>We'll let you know the results and what we plan to do about it tomorrow afternoon some time. <P>Btw.. that's the best wording I could come up with, but I'm willing to look at other wordings, provided they are all Yes/No Questions.</UL>

Wow, I knew international customers had it tough when it came to buying new software, but it seems for those trying to buy the Kunark upgrade have it even worse than they expected.  Here's one of the emails I've received regarding this issue:<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, it seems that there is a huge dispute about the cost of the game now. People outside of <br>the United States are having to pay as much as $50.00 and $60.00 in shipping and handling to <br>get a copy of the Kunark Update from Everquest Store. <br><br>It seems just for Australia, it will cost $58.00 for shipping and handling, making the cost of the upgrade $16.95 + $58.00 = $74.95, <br>while myself, who lives in the United States, only have to pay $16.95 + $7.00 = $23.95. This also means that people living over seas would be better off just waiting for the game to hit the markets and pay a lot less then the Shipping and Handling from EQ directly. This has been confirmed by myself and others from putting in different Over Seas address's in the EQ Online Store when you log into EverQuest. The shipping and handling is anywhere from $20.00 to $60.00 over the in store price at a regular store for Over Seas. </BLOCKQUOTE><br>Here's a second email from another international player:<br><BLOCKQUOTE>I was overjoyed to see the upgrade online today, and yet after filling in my details was blown away at the cost to get it to australia. it was $19 US for upgrade, and $58 for Shipping. How can they justify $58 for shipping. That comes to $115 Australian. Now the Game is retailing (or will retail at around $89-$99) australian. How can we be justified in paying a theoretically cheaper upgrade cost, to get it on the release date. When in fact, we are paying more than the entire game as a whole, not getting the extra account than we would get if we bought the retailversion, and will not get it before the release date of the expansion,(14th + 3 weeks minimum)which I thought was the Idea, so that we could all pay a cheap upgrade fee, and play at around the same time as the rest of the world.<br><br>I can understand a shipping fee. But i pay $10-$15 US (Shipping) for DVD's I import, and always get them within 2 and a half weeks.<br><br>Where, and why should we pay $58 Shipping if we can get it<br>sooner/cheaper buying the retail version. I would like to pay a cheaper upgrade fee, as the majority of your player base will be. I will also be reposting this message, and asking all other Overseas Everquest players to be checking there shipping costs, because I beleive it to be ludicrous.<br><br>Disgruntled (for the first time ever)<br>David Neighbour</BLOCKQUOTE><b>Update:</b> I just discovered the following letter in my inbox:<BLOCKQUOTE>Just a quick note for all of the U.S. Military stationed overseas: <br><br>Verant has left out the option of shipping the Kunark expansion to an<br>APO/FPO (overseas mailbox).  I sent an E-mail to their customer service,<br>hopefully it will be fixed soon.</BLOCKQUOTE>Let the web know what you think about this by heading over to the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5190">Freeport Tavern</a> or by leaving a comment.

An announcement was sent to me by Velglarn:<BLOCKQUOTE>House Ya'Ler is pleased to announce that we will be hosting a Tournament of <br>Champions on Saturday, April 8th, 2000, at 3pm EST in the Arena zone on the <br>Povar server.<br><br>This will be a TEAMS event, with an entry fee of 250pp per person, with a <br>split for first, second and third place teams to be 60%, 30%, and 10%.<br>Many people will show up late and/or individually, and thus teams are allowed <br>to be formed after the event has begun, but NOT after the first round is over.<br>We are still waiting to hear a response from the Server GM as to if he will <br>be able to come and witness this event, and even offer to be an impartial <br>referee.<br><br>Rules are as follows:<br>-Teams will pit themselves against each other, one at a time.<br>-Teams will have a MAXIMUM of six (6) people each.<br>-The last team left standing will win that round, and move on to the next.<br>-No potions, pumice stones, or clickable items (other than manastones, <br>journeyman boots, and masks of the deceiver) will be allowed.<br>-No pets.<br>-Once you are chosen to enter the Arena, you will have two minutes to finish <br>buffing/medding before the games begin.<br>-You will be warned that you are on-deck for the next battle, so use this <br>time to buff.<br>-PRIOR to battle and OUTSIDE the fighting area, you ARE allowed to receive <br>buffs from anyone.<br>-DURING the battle, ANY tactic may be used except those noted above.  <br>-Outside interference by registered combatants will result in <br>disqualification of your entire team.  Interference can include casting any <br>spell on a combatant, or using ooc, shout, or auction in excess.<br>-Anyone entering the Arena while a contest is being fought, or anyone <br>assisting any of the combatants, will be attacked and killed.  Contestants <br>will be allowed to enter when ASKED in order to destroy the interloper(s).<br>-You may enter more than once, on more than one team, but each entry requires <br>payment of the entry fee.<br>-Teams will NOT be allowed to change members once they have registered.  <br>Members can be added if the team is less than six (6), but a team that loses <br>a member cannot be replaced.<br>-All combatants will bind themselves OUTSIDE the actual fighting area before <br>the fight.<br>-Once you die, you may NOT reenter the Arena, and will ONLY do so to drag <br>your corpse out of the fighting area, AFTER the fight is done and a winner <br>declared.  NO LOOTING IN THE FIGHTING AREA.<br>-No special consideration will be shown to anyone who is Linkdead.  It is a <br>risk we all must take, and the show must go on.<br>-The entry fee is nonrefundable.  All proceeds are going to the winners.<br><br>In the spirit of fair play, we ask that you not let someone die through a DOT <br>or allow them to bleed to death, as they WILL lose experience if this <br>happens.  This event is to vent anger, make (or most likely lose) money, and <br>above all, have fun.  We know that there are some of you out there that just <br>want to enter this to kill your rivals, and we'll try to accommodate being <br>able to fight against them.  No promises however!<br>Hopefully, this event will run without a hitch, and will indeed become a <br>regular event on Povar.<br>For more information, email <a href="mailto:houseyaler@aol.com">houseyaler@aol.com</a>, visit our website at <br><a href="http://members.xoom.com/eqveritas">http://members.xoom.com/eqveritas</a> , or speak to Velglarn Ya'Ler in-game.<br><br>Velglarn Ya'Ler<br>House Ya'Ler<br>Povar</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Here's an excerpt:<UL>The president of Sony Online Entertainment, Lisa Simpson, resigned from her post this afternoon following the consolidation of the online divisions of Sony's entertainment units this week, according to a company-wide e-mail obtained by The Standard. <P>A front-runner to replace Simpson is former Sony employee Kelly Flock, who might be named the division's CEO, say sources familiar with the matter. <P>"It is with no small amount of regret that I'm writing to tell you that I [am] leaving SOE to take an exciting new role in another company," Simpson wrote in an e-mail sent to employees and to Sony Online Entertainment's board of directors at 2:10 p.m. PDT today. "I'll be happy to share the details with you in the coming days."<P> Executives at Sony Online Entertainment were unreachable for comment. </UL>Last we heard, Kelly Flock had been replaced at 989 and left the company to pursue other interests.

Colors sent me an interesting report containing a response from eBay regarding the recent Verant announcement.  Here's his letter:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hello,<br><br>I have done a lot of business with eBay <br>selling EQ items from different servers.  I was really concerned when I had <br>heard rumors that somehow eBay sellers and/or buyers would be banned from <br>EQ.  I had even heard that Verant/Sony may actually have eBay start <br>retracting auctions, etc.  I decided to write eBay and see what they had to <br>say.  Here is their response...<br><br><i>"Thank you for contacting us about your concern in this situation.<br>The auctioning of Everquest items is currently being reviewed by Sony.<br>At this time such sales are not prohibited on eBay.  We appreciate your <br>concern in helping to keep eBay a safe and reputable forum in which to <br>conduct business.  As always, if you have a question or problem, please <br>contact us and we will gladly assist you."</i><br><br>So apparently, as of now, eBay will not stop the auctions of Everquest <br>items.<br><br>Thank You,<br><br>Colors!</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the report. It will be interesting to see what measures Verant will take with eBay concerning these auctions.

Here's today's round of Gordon Infobits, with a few Brad-bits in it as an added bonus:<UL><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030661.html"><b>Next Data Patch</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone know when the next data patch is due to go live? ]</i><P><b>The way it's looking, early next week. Sorry for the delay. - Brad McQuaid</b><br>--<br>I do respond to some posts that fast.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030480.html"><b>Problem with /who all? </b></a><br>We changed /who all to return a count in the event that the filter returns so many that it would result in a truncated list. It turns out that no one likes this, so we'll be changing it back.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030615.html"><b>Clerics, Invincibility and Stun</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please explain the rationale behind the fact that when Clerics cast Divine Aura (or versions thereof), they are still able to be stunned by mobs. Is this an oversight or something not worth the effort to correct from a coding standpoint?]</i><P> It's purposeful. It falls under the "Nothing is perfect" idea. For instance, gate potions can fail, LOH can fizzle, Evac can leave some people behind, etc. <P><i>[Quote from original post: This was made like this on purpose for "game balance" which translates to... Verant wants you to die more, and doesn't give a flying frig what you think about that.]</i> <P>Well obviously we want your characters to die. What fun would the game be if that didn't happen? As for dying "more".... More than what? More than you would if you didn't get stunned? Sure, in the same fashion that you die more in South Ro because there are Sand Giants there. Incidently, you die LESS than you would if you didn't have the spell. Get my point?<P> <i>[Quote from original post: Maybe they should just give you complete invincibility for 1 hour.]</i><P>Yeah, we'll get right on that :)<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030627.html"><b>Researchers Unite </b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I would like to propose a new item in everquest. It is a 16 slot container that holds nothing but research words. i find it troublesome that 90% of my bank space is filled with backpacks with nothing but research pages, and i hesitate to throw them away or sell them. You never know who will need them someday. <P>Perhaps make it weigh 20 lbs, I don't care, as long as it fits in my bank and I can read the words when I open the container and move it to the top of the screen (ie: it doesn't block the text space on the screen). ]</i><P>We've seen this suggested many times, and really don't have a problem with it, unfortunately the core engine can't support containers with a size over 10.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030634.html"><b>Why has Verant chosen to cave to the hackers and vocal minority? </b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Scanning my tasklist for hack programs is not that big of a deal and if it gets rid of the hackers anyway, I say go for it. IMO it is not an invasion of privacy to do this. I give out more information, personal information, everytime I use my credit card at the store ]</i><P>Unfortunately it is a case where paranoia ended up winning out. I think that we could definitely have done a better job explaining what it was we were doing, and that would have lead to a bit more buy-in. Instead, some people decided to make up reports that we were scanning directory trees (false), internet files (false), internet history (false), cookies (false), and email (false), and unfortunately many people believed them. <P>The general paranoia resulted from the assumption that we (meaning: our servers) were actively collecting information from your system. This simply wasn't the case. The client simply would examine a small subset of information on your system, none of it containing information personally identifiable to a third party, and only send it to our server in the event that you were "running" an illegal program at the same time you ran EQ. We had absolutely no interest in what was installed on your system, only what you were running when you connected to ours. <P>I think privacy is important as well, but I don't really care about what a piece of client software is doing on my system. I only care when that piece of client software is transmitting information from my system to an outside source. In this case, the only time any data transmission was to take place was when something bad was found by the client. There was to be no server-side analysis of raw data. I'm sure that most people would agree that we do have a right to insure that our software license is being complied with. <P>In any case, I guess it's water under the bridge now. I'll blame Hollywood for all of the misunderstandings.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030654.html"><b>Privacy Issues, Hackers</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I've noticed that the hackers are the first people to cry foul about privacy but they don't mind breaking into systems and stealing data that doesn't belong to them. ]</i><P>Funny how that works, isn't it?<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030658.html"><b>Spoilers - What classes will the Iksar be?</b></a><br>I understand that you want to know, but its always been our policy to let people find things out for themselves. We never announced the classes that any of the races could be before release, and though this information turned up on sites anway, we didn't comment on it. <P>We're just sick that way :)<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030646.html"><b>Level 50 and Beyond Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I know you mentioned it before last month, that experience gainned for level 50 will not be taken away when the expansion takes affect. However, my friends dont seem to believe me and the post you answered concerning this on 08MARCH cant be accessed. Can you please reconfirm that no experience gainned in level 50 will be taken away when the expansion takes affect? ]</i><P>We won't be taking away any experience points. The only possible thing that could happen is if we adjust the experience required for level-50 prior to release. This is very unlikely, but I won't go so far as to call it impossible. Assuming that we don't adjust the experience curve for level 50, we fully expect many people to hit level 51 within minutes of logging on the day of release.<br>--<br><b>No exp was removed -- exp was recalculated, sometimes making it the exp bar at level 50 appear lower. - Brad McQuaid</b><P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030480.html"><b>Looking For a Few Good Sites</b></a><br>We're currently looking for a few cool EQ sites to list in the "Featured Site" section of the www.verant.com website. We are specifically looking for little-known sites that are updated regularly, contain tasteful content, and good art. If you know of a cool site that fits these requirements, please email me at gwrinn@verant.com. Please use the subject line of "Cool EQ Site" and place the URL in the body of the message to insure that I can view it. <br>--<br>I should clarify that we aren't looking for mainstream news sites (sorry guys, but you get enough publicity as it is:) and also aren't looking for sites that specialize in information that we would consider spoilers. <b>(Note from Aurum: Blast it! ;-))</b><P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030476.html"><b>Rules of Banking</b></a><br>Bankers (NPCs that you right-click on to open your bank account) have been in game since the earliest phases of beta. But it doesn't appear that that is who you are talking about. <P>Now it appears that you may be talking about players that exchange small coin denominations for larger ones, such as taking the 2000 silver off of someone in exchange for a lesser value of platinum. Assuming that this is what you are speaking of, you just need to find someplace notorious for generating large amounts of inferior coinage. The Treants in SK come to mind.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030439.html"><b>Intelligamer Editorial</b></a><br>I was very pleased to see that the news sites looked a bit deeper before responding to the grass-roots email drive by the 26 or so people who were participating in it.

ANY PET USER with sow or jboots can solo him u just run away while pet rips him a new one for 10 minits]</i><P> Thanks for the heads-up. We'll check into it. <P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030371.html"><b>More on +Mana Topic</b></a><br>Well I was able to track down some additional information that I don't mind distributing. The benefit of +mana items is scaled to reduce the impact of twinking in certain circumstances. I can't give you the formula, but I can say that if you load up your level 1 guy with +300 in mana items, he doesn't have 300 more mana. <P>The benefit that you can receive from a +mana item is based upon your total natural mana. <P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/028242.html"><b>Gordon Responds to Guild Command Ideas</b></a><br>Definitely some good ideas. I agree that some more robust guild-management commands would help things go more smoothly. I'll check into what may or may not be possible given the current archetecture. Currently, the server's do not keep track of players who are offline, so it could present some problems. We'll see what we can do, but no guarantees at this time.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029179.html"><b>More Odus Zones Coming</b></a><br>We have a few more zones planned for Odus, but it's too soon to comment on them at this time.

Do they still cause XP-loss on Rallos? What server do you speak of?<br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, there are still circumstances where you do, in fact, lose exp in a duel on a normal server. Case in point, 3 duels last weekend by myself and 5 others, all 3 of us are lvl 50 and lost exp upon death.]</i><P>Yeah, I can see this happening on some servers in a duel. DOTs are scored as environmental kills, such as drowning. These cause XP-loss on most servers, but not on the PvP servers due to the customer service issues there. It's currently on our plate to normalize that across all servers.<br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: Unfortunately, I believe a few spell lines were missed. I have not tested them all, but here are two I am sure of]</i><P>I mentioned in another thread yesterday that these were addressed on the Test server. They should work the next time we patch. <P></UL>

Like peers Ultima Online or Asharon's Call, it creates an online world in which tens of thousands of players can interact at once. <br><br>But the game's developers were concerned about unauthorized software that apparently gave some players extra information that they could use to take advantages of others, or even try to disrupt the game's servers. <br><br>In a message to players yesterday, the company said it was changing its game software to include a small program that would identify these "hacking" programs when players tried to use them. </UL>To read the complete article please use the link provided in the above.

I just received a letter from Verant CEO John Smedley regarding the new policies and security checks announced yesterday.  Here's the complete letter:<UL><i>Ok. We put the poll in, and with roughly 15,000 people participating thepoll came up with 83% of the people being fine with us running the check forcheating.<P>DESPITE THIS POLL we have decided that it's the wrong thing to do. Enoughpeople have convinced us that it's chipping away a little too much atpeople's privacy EVEN if they do consent for us to implement this policy.<P>Therefore, the change to the EULA will read as follows:<P>Solely for the purpose of patching and updating the Game, you hereby grantus permission to (i) upload Game file information from the Everquestdirectory and (ii) download Game files to you.<P>Now, before anyone wonders exactly what this is, let me explain. Technicallyspeaking we probably should have had this language in there from day one foryou to consent us to even download new game files to you in the first place.We apologize for not realizing that we should have gotten this consent, butlive and learn.<P>We can admit when we make mistakes, and I believe this is a case where weowe an apology to our Playerbase. In our haste to try and thwart people fromdamaging the game we went overboard.<P>There will be absolutely no scanning of anyones computer for any reasonother than the normal patching process (which won't do any sort of checkingon what you have running).<P>Regards,<P>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL>Thanks John!

The following report was sent in by Golgi:<BLOCKQUOTE>A faint laughter can be heard upon the rising wind, a husky voice, filled with hatred and disgust.<br> <br>The voice grows from gentle laughter to a roaring shout, "Children of Scale!  You shall not succeed this night.  I shall make sure of it!  For centuries, you have evaded me!"<br> <br>"Now, this shall end.  Everything that you possess... is but a waste!"<br> <br>The voice dies down again, but the wind rages on, swaying the few burned trees which line the firey mountains, their trunks creaking beneath the very force of wind.<br> <br>As silence descends, the voice begins to speak again, it's tone filled with mocking endeaderment.<br> <br>The voice cries, "Your names, your faces and your very ways shall fade from view.  Such a pity it is indeed, that the world shall know my name, and that of your Queen's fall from history and of the Gods and Mortals alike!"<br> <br>The shadows quickly retreat back to the corners and stones from which they came, their tendrils rising in the air and the sound of a thousand shrieks echo across the Lavastorm Mountains.<br> <br>As the shadows slither away from view, the voice can be heard, faintly hissing foul words.<br> <br>"You have evaded me this day, Children of Scale, but it shall not be the last battle which you will face!"<br> <br>"Rend your viel and harness your power, it shall do nothing for you, as in the end, you all shall perish, dragon and mortals alike, your corpses shall rot at my feet.  For this, I can asure you."<br> <br>"Untill that night comes, I bid thee all a good morrow, and watch your back.."

It probably doesnt matter where the venue is (though west coast would be good) as long as all five to ten players are together.<br> <br>If you are a level 50 or higher player and are interested in appearing in a tv show, please contact Trevor on 503 238 0690 or at <a href="mailto:coreculture@boardwild.com">coreculture@boardwild.com</a><br> <br>Look forward to chattin. <br>Trevor Avedissian/creative director</UL>Thanks Trevor!

Gordon, as always, has been busy on the Gameplay board.  The following list contains all his most recent posts over the last 24 hours:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030344.html"><b>Enchanter Illusions</a></b><br>I disagree that the current illusions aren't useful. I see many an enchanter running around illusioned as something from time to time. <P>That's one of the reasons that we added bonuses to the various illusions, to make them useful.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030380.html"><b>Real-Money Auctions and Platinum</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: "You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material."  This could be interpreted to disallow in-game sales, which is clearly not the intent. Is the intent to allow out of game sales for in game goods? Platinum only auctions for example?]</i><P>Exchange of items for platinum doesn't constitute a "sale" from a legal standpoint. You're simply playing the game. <P>It is not our intent to interfere with the player economy.<P><LI><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030304.html">Has a Verant employee played a character all the way to level 50?</a></b><br>This question keeps coming up and the answer is yes. I know of one person here who has played a troll SK to 50, several who have played rogues, a few more who have played warriors. I'm sure there is a monk or two running around as well. <P>I think that some people think that "if only a dev team member would play my class, we'd be better". That might be true if it weren't for the ability of our game designers to distance themselves from the typical class-envy traps and overcome bias. If anything, perhaps some of the class-experiences encountered by people here led to the class becoming more difficult overall. For instance, I find it a bit humorous when some necromancers complain about how weak they are, since I *know* that it is not the case. I'm sure similar things happen in regards to the other classes.<br>--<br>A couple of people play on the Test server, but most play on Live servers. <br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: Why does my KICK sometimes do MORE damage than my Executioner's axe?  Com'on now, a little realism couldn't hurt.]</i><br>Hmmm, not sure how this ended up in this thread, but I'll bite :)  I imagine it would be possible to just barely knick someone with an axe, but land a kick square in the vitals. Seems realistic enough.<P><LI><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030317.html">Kunark, Skills and More</a></b><br>We've compensated for the problems with sense/disarm traps in different ways that balance the class. As much as we'd like to remove all traces of the sense/disarm trap skills, they are in the character files and therefore can't just be yanked out. "Climbing" wouldn't work out well since the world is already designed taking into account the locations that a player can or cannot reach. As for "Negotiation", the prices of items are already modified in regards to charisma.<br>--<br>We have added subsequent effects to skills. For instance, Crippling Blow has a chance to stun the opponenet. As for additional effects, we'll consider them as we have a need for additional abilities and skills.<br>--<br>Most of the new graphics/textures are based upon world geometry and objects in the Kunark lands, not on mobile objects that travel between the two. As such you won't have a need to see the majority of the new art if you don't purchase Kunark. As for the mobile stuff, you should be able to see all of that without a problem.<br>--<br><i>[Any new classes soon?]</i> Nothing planned at present.<br>--<br>When you choose your deity, you are determining the way your character ran his or her life prior to you gaining control over it (from an RP standpoint). From a gameplay standpoint, this is another case where we had to make a choice, and that choice was that religion would be both useful and balanced. In order to balance usefulness, there must be a downside associated with it. As such, NPCs can see through your religion.<br>--<br><i>[Any male models with long hair on the way?]</i> No. Hair is part of the character model, and long hair was only built on to the female models. It is for all intents and purposes an extra appendage. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030314.html"><b>Do you know about the disease/poison based DoT's not giving a message when they wear off? </b></a><br>Yes, it's fixed on test already.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030301.html"><b>Gordon Responds to Guide Account Auction</b></a><br>My money is on it being a scam. The person doing the auction doesn't have any feedback, so any fool with a keyboard could post the same thing. Secondly, guide accounts do not have any abilities that would allow them to obtain the items listed. Thirdly, GM accounts attempting to create the listed items would noted *very* quickly. <P>Just a hint, don't believe everything you read on the internet.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030303.html"><b>Hardware Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why did Verant release a "fix" that requires us to change the settings on our machines, thereby crippling the defining feature of the Sound Blaster Card?]</i><P> It's not a fix, it's a work-around designed to help you get by while our people here conference with Creative Labs and come up with a solution. <P><i>[Quote from original post: We no longer hear Environmental Audio with the acceleration turned down, so couldn't Verant simply revert the drivers to before the patch went in?]</i><P> No, part of the problem is that as new hardware drivers are released, the software has to maintain compatibility. Because EQ is a multiplayer game that is constantly evolving, we can't just make like a single-player game and say that the new drivers are unsupported. The release of the new LiveWare made going back impossible. <i>[Quote from original post: Will you actually fix this problem in the near future, or is this work around satisfactory with Verant?]</i><P> We don't consider the work-around to be sufficient and have someone working nearly full-time on resolving the issues. <P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030297.html"><b>Trade Skill Suggestion</b></a><br>Though a good idea, the current system of EQ wouldn't support this well as we would run into the problem mentioned by ksandjh (buying experience with Plat). I am aware that this problem exists a few places in game as it, and it isn&#8217;t very pretty. This is something that we can keep in mind for the future though.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030291.html"><b>Mages' Pets</b></a><br>Though I'm sure many mages would "like to see" the pets enhanced, we feel that they are fairly well-balanced at this point.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030295.html"><b>Permanent Death Debate</b></a><br>Wow! I haven't seen this argument since about March of 97. It's nice to see one of the good ole' ones come back once in a while :)<P>I do think that most people will agree now that EQ really wouldn't support permanent death very well. Actually I don't think that it will ever be supported well in any MMORPG. MMORPGs are about risk, reward, and character development. I think that in order to maintain some facet of character development, you'd have to make death so rare that there would be no risk. At that time, the whole concept of the game falls apart.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030262.html"><b>Reason for Lack of Auto-Equip Loot Feature</b></a><br>Back in beta when you right-clicked on items on your corpse you would auto-equip the items. I believe it was changed to add an aspect of realism to looting your corpse. Sure, it doesn't take the 30 minutes it would really take to climb into a suit of plate, but it isn't exactly instantaneous either.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030256.html"><b>How can we test things we can't see?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: How can we test something we can't see? You've told us time and time again that some things are supposed to be a secret (like mana) so the "mystery of the game" is kept intact. ]</i><P>Someone obviously felt that they had enough information to propose that +mana items weren't giving their full mana, so I figured that perhaps they weren't the only ones. In any case, +mana items give the stated amount of mana regardless of race or class (confirmed today), so the question is moot anyway. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030260.html"><b>Blackburrow, not Butcherblock</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original message: Someone at Verant, please acknowledge the fact that you have accidentally turned on the flag for the wrong "BB" zone, and it makes no sense for people to Shrink in Butcherblock instead of Blackburrow. That's it. That's all.]></i><P>We're checking into this, but I think it's fairly safe to say that someone got their BB's mixed up when the zone headers were being inputed. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/028990.html"><b>More on Enchanters</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Will enchanters get a comment about their issues anytime soon? This week, this month, this year? Ever?]</i><P> It's a bit of a loaded question, but post some "enchanter issues" and I'll see what I can do. I will warn you however that we consider the classes in general very well-balanced at this time.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029697-2.html"><b>Is Rallos Zek Being Ignored?</b></a><br>You aren't being ignored, you just aren't receiving the focus. We chose to aim our efforts at Tallon/Vallon because both of those servers came up at the same time with the same rules. This provided a good foundation to determine whether or not the changes that we made were effective in making PvP better by examining the population differential between those two servers. <P>Making the changes on Rallos wouldn't really have told us too much.<br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: People stayed, despite COIN ONLY. And people stay on Valon Despite Item loot. Both flawed systems. But we prevail for other reasons, which have little to with with a "successful pvp" system. ]</i><P>This is the reason that we intend on letting people switch between Tallon and Vallon after the expansion, to determine which method people *actually* perfer. <P><i>[Quote from original post: You'll see VERY VERY little support for COIN only are Naked PvP item loot. You'll see a compromise from many players wanting some measure of exp loss. Thems the facts.]</i><P> Sure, and the people posting in the PvP forum aren't representative of the people playing on the PvP servers. They are by definition the people who are generally unhappy with the system, or people who want to enact some kind of change, hence their presense on the boards. It's just the way these boards work. <P>My studies suggest that though people believe that there should be some risk, they wouldn't buy into a system where death caused XP loss. Now if we could find a way to reasonably poll just the PvP players, we could find out what the players as a whole really want in those regards.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/025541-5.html"><b>Bug List</b></a><br>I've referred this thread to the test team to be sure that the bugs listed are in our bug database. One thing I would like everyone to keep in mind is that just because you don't like something doesn't mean that it's a bug. For instance, the /con system. It is intended that as you level a balanced group is assumed for the /con message in many cases. <P>There are also other cases where things perceived and admitted to be bugs might be passed on when deciding whether or not to fix it. Things that would require an excessivly large download (like graphics or world geometry problems) are a good example of this. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030032.html"><b>Whitened Treant Fists</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: If Monks are made to rely on very little, equipment wise, then why is there a weapon that is better than our own 2 hands?]</i> <P>Because it wouldn't have made much sense to put a weapon out there that's worse than your own two hands. No one would use it. I guess you are really going to be upset when you find out that there's two weapons out there actually better than this one. <P><i>[Quote from original post: I'm not trying to be sarcastic. It just baffles me why you have done this.]</i> <P>Why do you think we named them the Whitened Treant Fists? :)</UL>Also, you may have noticed I did the infobits in a slightly different format.  If people prefer the new format please post a comment so I know I'm not wasting time.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
I just receive an important letter from Verant President John Smedley addressing several of EverQuest's major issues. Topics included in this letter are Kunark, login server changes, ShowEQ and hacking and eBay. It is now forbidden to auction EverQuest acounts and items on eBay for money. Here's the letter:<UL><I>Dear EverQuest Players,<P>An exciting time is now at hand. Within the next 2 days the Login Serverswill be coming down and we will be doing a patch that will add the EverQuestStore into the front end of the game. At that time, the first product we will be offering will bethe EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark (RoK) upgrade for existing customers. This will allow existingcustomers of EverQuest to purchase RoK for $16.95 (Plus S&H). In addition, we will offer variousshipping options depending on which country you live in. EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark will be launchingon April 24th. We want to insure that this product is in everybody's hands on or before that date.<P>In addition to this change, we will also be modifying our User Agreement andSoftware License to add in some additional Terms and Conditions that we will require everyone toagree to before playing EverQuest.<P>The first of these changes concerns the selling of EverQuest Characters andItems outside of the game (i.e. things like Ebay). Here is the text of this change:<P>"You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin orcopyrighted material."<P>You may ask why we are doing this. There are many reasons, but first andforemost of them is the amount of trouble this is causing our Customer Service group. Simply put there area lot of people out there who defraud others and we are being put in the middle of it, and we don'thave the time or the resources to assist people with these disputes when they arise. The next reason is amore philosophical one and that is that we believe people should have to earn their items and characters in thegame rather than from buying them outside the game. Obviously the second point can be argued from otherperspectives that we do in fact respect, but we wanted you to hear ours.<P>The next change to the User Agreement and Software license concerns ourefforts to stop people from hacking EverQuest and from doing malicious acts that we feel can affect EverQuest as anongoing business concern. We have developed the technology to check for these hacking tools/programs and report that fact back to us. Withoutgetting into the specifics of this technology, I can say that we in no way will search a user's harddrive(aside from the EverQuest directory during the patching process), registry nor will we send back any information other than the fact that auser is in fact running one of these programs (specifically we are NOT sending information about everything the user is running back to ourservers).<P>It's disturbing that the amount of recent developments in the hacking community force us to do this. Many will say "ShowEQ"  isn't worth worrying about. To us, it's cheating and it's not something we can allow in a game like EverQuestwhere it affects other people's enjoyment of the game. In addition, althoughthis is the first time we'll be acknowledging this, ShowEQ isn't the worstoffender. Recently we had someone attempting to bring down our servers withanother malicious program. We were able to quickly identify what was goingon and insure this didn't happen again, but nonetheless the potential isthere and we need to be able to quickly identify and stop these types ofprograms. Again, I want to say it clearly that we will in NO WAY send any information back tothe Everquest servers other than information regarding programs that we feel interfere with the intendedoperation of EverQuest. We have had this technology available for some time, but recently we've found it's going to beneccessary to go to greater lengths to stop this kind of thing. To those ofyou concerned about privacy (and rightly so) I want to say that we feel it'sneccessary to do this but we want you to be informed that we are going totry these measures to protect both ourselves and the game's players.<P>Here is the text of this change:<P>"You hereby grant us permission to download Game-related files toyou. You also grant us permission to access, extract and upload(i) Game-related data as part of the patching process and (ii)data relating to any program that we, in our reasonable discretion,determine interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest."<P>Thanks,<P>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</I></UL>Very big needs indeed. Thanks John!
