Last night a new message went up on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>December 1st, 7:00pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>*SBLive Soundcards and Hardware Acceleration*<br><br>Due to some past problems with SBLive cards, users of those cards who called into tech support were asked to turn "Hardware Acceleration" down one notch in DXDIAG.  The last patch corrected those problems and most users should again increase hardware acceleration to maximum.  <br><br>To do this:<br><br>1. Click "Start"<br>2. Click "Run"<br>3. Type "DXDIAG.EXE" and press enter.<br>4. Click on the "Sound" tab.<br>5. Increase the "Hardware Acceleration" slider to maximum.<br><br>Doing this should correct issues such as not hearing certain sounds or sound volume disparities.  <br><br>The only users who may not want to do this are Windows 2000 users.  Creative Labs is currently working on new drivers for Win2K, so you may wish to wait until these drivers are completed prior to increasing hardware acceleration.<br><br>Finally, all SBLive users should get LiveWare 3.0 from <a href="http://www.soundblaster.com/liveware/.">http://www.soundblaster.com/liveware/.</a>  After installing LiveWare, you will then want to REINSTALL the latest drivers for your sound card.  The order of installation is important.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Brad McQuaid added his comments to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035877.html">yesterday's thread</a> focusing on a variety of EQ issues including nerfs: <UL><i>I do recall replying to AuntieShaynta publicly quite some time ago, stating that it was still our intent to implement Enchanters enchanting items, but that such plans were still very much in the planning stages and considered long term. <br><br>And I stand by it -- I still think we'll see that one day (and given our desire to pretty much freeze class balancing, it will probably be one of the last significant class enchancements). But hey, never say never :)  Consider traps :)<br><br>Also, if I recall correctly, item enchantment was also talked about in earlier pre-release (probably pre-beta, but I'm not certain) FAQs, but I later had it removed (along with guildhouses, lycanthropy, vampirism, etc.) It simply was one of the few features we'd planned on but didn't have time to deliver on. <br><br>It does trouble me a little that even though I try to be clear about whether something is short term, or long, or something we're only thinking about, etc. that it often turns into a 'promise' over time... but I guess that's unavoidable. It's a form of the 'telephone game' quite often, where one person hears that we said one thing, and then they tell somebody else, and the message sort of evolves from there :)<br><br>Just to let you all know, there are still a TON of things we want to add to EQ, and we feel EQ has a very long life ahead of it. For example, although it's too early to say much, I will say that we've got some VERY big plans post-Velious. <br><br>And Tera, wow... not sure what to say :(  I certainly do my best to live up to my word. Again, though, some times things I talk about as something planned evolve somehow into 'promises'... And then some things I hopefully characterized as 'long term' are still just that: long term plans that haven't happened yet. <br><br>All things considered I'm very proud of our track record and just how much of the game we talked about pre-release game into fruition. And I'm also very proud of where the live and expansion teams have taken the game post-release. IMHO, EQ is almost everything we'd planned it to be and a whole lot more. <br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

This is today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036041.html"><b>"We're locking threads..."</b></a><br>Posts that are monopolizing the front page with a particular issue are being locked. That's clearly defined as against the rules in the board FAQ. Chances are that if an issue is that important it's already been addressed a number of times. The mage pets issue that's currently hot falls under this definition. We've announced exactly what changes were made, and no changes other than what we've told you have been made. We've continued "looking into" the issue over the past several days and can find absolutly nothing to suggest that any other changes have occurred. If something changes we'll let you know, but until then the issue is closed. <br><br>Posts that are rude or antagonistic are being locked. See the FAQ. <br><br>Posts asking why threads are being locked are being locked. Posting threads of this nature is essentially spamming the boards, so please don't do it. <br><br>Thank you for your cooperation, <br><br>-Gordon<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036095.html"><b>Pets</b></a><br>I did some testing, specifically with 49th level necro and mage pets, and compared them to my results from early this year. Both pets were naked, no buffs, and both had similar results to what occurred earlier this year with the same tests. <br><br>I'm not sure what I can say to put everyone's concerns to rest. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036036.html"><b>Verant Ignoring Reasonable Requests?</b></a><br>This issue has come up a number of times and I've explained our position. We do not do ad hoc moves between servers. <br><br>The sheer number of requests along this line that would come in would keep a staff three times our size busy 24 hours per day. Remember that there are over 300K people playing EverQuest, and number of characters are well into the millions. <br><br>Now it has been suggested that we should charge for the service, but we feel that server communities are important, and that characters should have to live with their reputations. <br><br>The short of it is that it is not economically feasible to do ad hoc moves, and even if we were to set it up so that it was, we'd still be dealing with the issue of the importance of server communities.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036147.html"><b>Endless Threads on Same Subject</b></a><br>Endless new threads on the same topic: Why they hurt everyone... <br><br>It's simple. People go looking for "official" posts on an issue, and instead of having to look at two or three, they have to filter through dozens. The ones with the official replies are missed and end up down on page 10, while post after post gets bumped to the front page asking "Why are you ignoring this". Please, do everyone a favor and use the search tool to look and see if there's a post on your issue that may have been answered already. I've personally answered 3 of these pet posts today, and read at least half a dozen threads asking why we haven't responded to the issue since then. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036106.html"><b>More Q&A</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Did you say that DEX was much lower for pets now ? ]</i></font><br><br>No. The Dex of pets is not lower than it ever was. What is lower is their proc percentage chance based off of that dex. It used to roll of the NPC table and now rolls of a PC table. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does DEX affect the fact that an Attack lands, and also affects damage ? ]</i></font><br><br>No. It does not. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Did you also lower AGI on pets now ? ]</i></font><br><br>We have not lowered any pet stats. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Now... I have the same example in about 4 or 5 threads of a battle with a blue croc in other posts. My pet was getting hit for more damage, and was hitting less often for less damage. Coincidence ? How can 2 hours of trying the same thing be coinsidence ? I played in Oasis for a few hours prior patch and it wasn't that way. ]</i></font><br><br>You aren't dealing with constants when fighting things in Oasis. NPCs have level ranges. Pets have level ranges. Hit and miss percentages have ranges. Damage dealt and damage taken have ranges. A combination of good or bad rolls on one side or another can make it appear that things have changed in one way or another, but they haven't. <br><br>I've been back and forth with several programmers over the past two weeks about this, in addition to running my own tests and having them run theirs. The only determination that we've made is that aside from the procing weapon issue, which I think people understand as a bug fix at this point, is that they have not changed. <br><br>Perhaps the best way I can "prove" to everyone that they haven't changed is by pointing to the lack of people with concrete figures here. When we *really* change something, the board is flooded with a certain type of player making complaints. These are the people who log and parse everything, and can find changes with the combat engine down to single percentage points. Those people are not here. What we have are people who "get the feeling that" something is different. <br><br>Trust me, if there was something different with the basic way pets were in combat, there would be players here with exact figures explaning exactly what changed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036148.html"><b>When will SoV go live?</b></a><br>Providing that retailers don't sell it too soon, it will be live on the servers by the time you get home from the store with your box.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035759.html"><b>Patches and Bugs</b></a><br>We correct outstanding issues with nearly every patch. As much as I'm sure everyone would like to see every outstanding issue addressed in one patch, it's not realistic for us to do that. Just because we don't fix all of them in every patch, or don't reply every time they are reposted on the bug board, doesn't mean that we aren't listening. <br><br>By the way, could you explain #2 a little better? I can't make sense of it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036023.html"><b>Polls and Statistics</b></a><br>My first instinct was to pass this post up because it uses the "pull numbers of out thin air and call them facts" method of debate. The only way to "address" a post of this nature is to spend a day researching all of the correct numbers for the purpose of showing what really is fact. That would take too much time and only validate this method as a way to get a response, which is why we pass these posts up. <br><br>That said, there is one claim I would like more information on: <br><br>What server is this that you play on that you've noticed a 200-300 player drop at peak over the past year? <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035997.html"><b>Female Rest Animation</b></a><br>We don't like the way that the stance looks.

Alan kept busy on the Gameplay Board today.  The following contains the latest messages posted by him, along with one post from Gordon as well:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036114.html"><b>Spam: First Post from Gordon & Followed Up by Alan</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It's worth the headache for them. Even the most belly-aching posters sometimes post good ideas. Verant then comes though and cherry picks the good ideas and implements them. Many good improvements came from suggestions on this board. I am sure that Absor and Abashi may hate their jobs some times, but were else can they get this many people that have ideas to improve their product. ]</i></font><br><br>Very well said Orm. <br><br>Good ideas do come from these boards, and they are often the first place that we get some real-time feedback on problems that pop up from time to time. <br>--<br>We don't hate our jobs! <br><br>And I do my best to revisit posts and see what responses my comments earn. That's the essence of communicating. Spamming is like yelling at someone repeatedly to get attention. It doesn't mean that the person yelling isn't in need of help, but it sure doesn't make for effective communication.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036115.html"><b>Q&A</b></a><br>Belgariad wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Mage Epic. There was some talk from alan that you might change the cloak from quillmane. If that is planned than i would like you to hear this suggestion in how it would drop. Have a new NPC in a mid level zone (that doesn't have a lot of newbies that would try and ninja the items). Have that NPC ask for the two quest focus items that wasn't requested in the epic (the torch and the stien). When you turn these 2 items in it would spawn a high level elemental (like the one in Burning woods for cleric epic quest) that a 4 to 5 groups could kill with some trouble. The elemental would drop the cloak used in the Air portin of this quest."]</i></font> <br><br>If there is a change to the cloak drops, it will probably not be anything nearly that dramatic. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Next concern in the mage epic is that so far nobody on any server has gotten burning ember and can prove that they got it. People has been killing every wurm countless times that are a short jounery from skyfire. Is there any way for you to get EsterTheTester to go to a live server and let her try and get it. "the burning embers from a notable member of wurm-kind who can be found a short journey from here " this is the only clue to burning ember and there are a lot of notable members of wurm-kind near skyfire. <br><br>Dirt of underfoot a stealf enhacement and than a stealf nerf. It was put into the game on the patch before thanksgiving and it dropped every time when you killed silxen the mighty in BW. About 5 days later BW was patched by itself and mages thought that it was to fix the noexesting burning embers but what happened was that the dirt of underfoot now is a very rare drop." ]</i></font><br><br>Burning Embers were, in fact, goofed up severely. They are in game now, I've seen them myself. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Any idea when the staff from Inny will be moved to his mionions like the quest giver tells us?" ]</i></font><br><br>When/if that happens, keep in mind that it will be moved to an equally difficult opponent. Such a move will probably not make the item easier to obtain. I've got no estimate for the timing of such a move, I can't even promise you that it will happen for sure.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036172.html"><b>Sympathy</b></a><br>Thanks. <br><br>It's not as bad as you make it seem, really. I'm having a ton of fun.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036031.html"><b>More on Thread Locking</b></a><br>Yup. I am only locking pet threads to keep the board open for you to talk about other things, like the Test Server, if you want. And mages would be better served posting in one thread, it makes it much easier for me to read and respond.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036034.html"><b>More Pet Threads</b></a><br>Secias, <br><br>I'm locking the extraneous threads about pets. I'm doing it because some of you are forcing me to do it, and because I want to converse with people about it, not hunt down individual posts. <br><br>And now, because I'm wasting my time locking threads, I'm going to ask you to stop posting more threads like this one. Please. I'm not inclined toward sending warnings&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036021.html"><b>Locked Pet Threads</b></a><br>Unfortunately, I am locking threads again. It's not very useful to any of us that are actually trying to discuss this issue to have to hunt for information. If we stick to one location we'll be able to talk about it much more easily. And this board isn't as useful if the front page is full of post on one topic.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035605.html"><b>New Link Death Issue</b></a><br>I don't know what to say... <br><br>Ok, maybe I do. <br><br>I'll send this link to some of the guys here. But you're much better off posting this on the tech board. I'm not a tech...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035877-2.html"><b>Negative Respect</b></a><br>I'm going to respond only to the original post. It would take me hours to respond to the whole thing in any detail at all&#8230; :)<br><br>AuntieShaynta: <br><br>Well, I stand by my 'victims' statement. I'm not going to argue it with you, except to suggest that perhaps you didn't read it as I intended to write it. The fault there would lie with me, I understand. I could spend another ten posts discussing it, but that would be redundant. I'm sorry if you don't agree with me. But I see no reason for that to make you respect me less. That's something I'll have to think about. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Instead, what you (Verant) did was to purposefully and knowingly give an ability to other classes and purposefully and knowingly did not give enchanters this ability -- nor any form of compensation."]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, we did. And we didn't give it to the other&#8230; minor pet classes either. We gave it to the classes that we consider primary pet classes. I honestly see nothing wrong with this. And I see no logic behind the idea that one class should be 'compensated' for things done to other classes. Should we, then, reduce the power of your class any time we reduce the power of another? I think you're failing to see the larger picture. We didn't make that choice to spite anyone, be they enchanter or shaman or any other class (in a way, rogues could use your argument and want to know why they were not also compensated for something that the these other classes were given). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "1) I was told by Verant that I would be able to enchant weapons, including the ability to enchant weapons to cast spells. I have seen this degraded several times despite a direct promise from Brad that enchanters enchanting weapons WOULD be implemented "in the long run". Now I see several spells that appear to be the "enchant weapon" spells -- being given to other classes. I'm reserving judgement, frankly against my better judgement." ]</i></font><br><br>I've been following this game as long as anyone, longer than most. I've seen what you saw too, though not in exactly the same way. <br><br>At first the idea of enchanting weapons was just that, an idea. It became a 'something we'd really like to do' thing before beta. During beta it became a 'we really want to do it, but it doesn't look like we can' thing. At release it was the same way, something that they wanted to do. I don't remember any promises, from Brad or anyone else. But I might have missed that. <br><br>I can't say I disagree with you about the apparent ability that another class might or might not be getting to do something that seems very similar to enchanting an item. Personally, I plan to push for that ability, if it exists, to be given to enchanters in some way. But there may be technical issues that neither you nor I are aware of. So let's both wait and see. Though I kinda fail to see how any of this make me less respectable&#8230; Remember, you were talking about Absor, not Verant&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "2) I saw the by-any-definition poorly-handled "mage pets aren't dual wielding" fiasco solved in what had to be the second poorest way possible -- requiring giving pets weapons but removing the delay-reducing benefit of doing so. A blatant nerf to the two classes that could already have a dual wielding pet by giving them weapons. One of those classes got an admittedly small compensations. The other was told "You're not a pet class" -- despite the fact we get pets at every spell level pre-50. I took this in stride, but it was noted." <br><br>3) Now I see what should have been the solution to the mage-pet-dual-wielding fiasco being put in much later -- and once again enchanter pets are purposefully left out. Without compensation. In fact, with a mild attendent nerf (I can't attest to this myself, as I haven't even seen a SoR yet ingame) of our pets not proc'ing as much as they used to." ]</i></font><br><br>And I guess your disagreement is with the idea that enchanters are not a pet class. They are a secondary pet class. There are two primary pet classes, magicians and necromancers. All others are secondary pet classes. *shrug* I can see how you might not like that definition, but that is the definition (we not only 'get' to set those definitions, we 'must' set those definitions or the classes wouldn't be balanced at all). Enchanters are unique in their way, as you say. They get pets at all levels. But you'll note that they also have very weak pets, in comparison. That is by design. <br><br>I think the problem here is perspective. Mine is that enchanters are secondary pet classes, and therefore they shouldn't have pets that get to dual wield without a weapon. Yours is that you are a pet class and therefore your pets deserve that ability. I don't know what I can say to change your perspective. And I don't know what you can do to change mine. I only wish you could understand why we made that choice. It's really not a matter of 'compensation' for anything done in the past. It's a matter of how it should be. We can't sacrifice the balance of the game just to compensate for things we might have done in the past. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: " What's more, I know you (Verant) aren't going to correct any of the "core" problems with EQ. Everything is subject to change, it seems, except the things that most need changing." ]</i></font><br><br>What are the core problems? I'm curious about your take on that. Certainly the fact that enchanters don't make magic items isn't a core problem. It might be the core of your personal dissatisfaction with your favorite class, one that I can't deny. I wish it was in there too. But enchanters work, they work well. They are unique, they fit into the game, they&#8230; they work. Do they work as they were initially intended? Maybe, but not entirely. Do they work the way you want them to? It seems not. That's unfortunate. But enchanters are still a rockin' class, and they have some of the coolest abilities of any class in game (and I'm not talking about Clarity, I'm talking about illusions). <br><br>But, at the end of all of this, I have to ask the personal question, since this is clearly a personal issue between you and me. How have _I_ earned your disrespect?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035984.html"><b>Entering World Bug?</b></a><br>A thorough file check is the first step in fixing something like this, especially since it's pretty easy to do. :)<br><br>But in general you're better off posting your technical problems on our tech support board. David does a great job helping people with their technical problems.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035959.html"><b>Board Problems</b></a><br>Alright... <br><br>So now I have to go from locking post about pets, to locking posts about the posts about pets... <br><br>*sigh*</UL>

Pets have been a hot issue lately on EverQuest boards across the net.  In the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035388.html">following thread</a> Alan summarizes things up:<UL><i>Let me summarize, for convenience sake, the changes that we have made to pets over the course of the last few patches.<br><br>Pets wielding weapons will now proc with those weapons just as frequently as a player character with that weapon and the same stats. This has reduced the frequency of weapon procs from pets. To make this change we simply removed an artificial multiplier to pet proc chances, no stats or attributes were changed.<br><br>Pets wielding the Sword of Runes will proc with that sword as often as they do with any other procing weapon, but it will only proc against its intended target, summoned creatures.<br><br>Magician and necromancer pets (and because they use the same spells, shadowknight pets as well) now have the ability to duel wield without a weapon, if they are powerful enough. This will happen with some regularity with pets cast from 39th level (52nd for shadowknights) spells and above.<br><br>No other changes to the duel wielding ability of any other pets was changed. This ability was not given to any other pet because magicians and necromancers are primary pet classes, the others are not.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>

I received the following from Fitten:<BLOCKQUOTE>Outdoor Dragon Hat Trick and Two (Three) Rathe Server Firsts!<br> <br>Last night Blades of Destiny on The Rathe were looking for something to do and ended up pulling a hat trick involving the three outdoor dragons in Kunark.  First stop was Severilous, who fell as usual.  Next, everyone flitted off to Skyfire to attempt Talendor.  Having been unsuccessful against Talendor a couple times in the past, we were going to give new tactics a try.  We met Talendor and laid him low for the first time on the server!  Buoyed by these two successes, everyone decided to run give Gorenaire a try -- surely our stars were aligned properly as evidenced by the success of this server first!  We regrouped quickly and met Gorenaire in Dreadlands for the first time since the day these three dragons were introduced into the game.  The first clash sent us packing but was a close fight.  We decided to quickly regroup and give it another go.  This second attempt was met with success!  Congrats to Blades of Destiny for pulling off all three outdoor dragons in one night, two of which were Rathe server firsts!!  These server firsts followed on the heals of the first killing of Silverwing in Veeshan's Peak on the Rathe by Blades of Destiny this past weekend!

Veeshan's Peak, considered by most to be the most difficult of all EQ's zones, has been defeated on two seperate servers recently.  Damodread sent in the first report for the Cazic-Thule server:<BLOCKQUOTE><s>Me and my guild, The Dark Vigilantes, cleared Veeshan's <br>Peak yesterday, taking out Silverwing, Hoshkar, Druushk, <br>Nexona, Xygox and Phara Dar.  We were actually quite <br>impressed with ourselves since we were able to clear it in <br>our first time in the zone.  This just proves that my <br>guildmates are some of the best EQ players around.  My <br>thanks goes out to all of them and the other players <br>invited on the raid (especially Dobbwin! thanks for saving <br>my butt!).  Here's a small list of the loot:<br><br>Garrison received a Sword of Rile<br>Ouden received that crappy Enchanters robe<br>Kakamar received a Flowing Water Katana<br>Zaben received Grey Suede Boots<br>Smashbash received Shield of the Elders<br><br>There were also many other loots but I don't remember who <br>received what. I'll ask around.<br><br>As far as I know this is the first VP clearing on <br>Cazic-Thule.  We hope to do this again in the future and as <br>often as possible.  Thanks again to all my guildmates!<br><br>Damodread Dreamweaver<br>Cleric of the 60th Season<br>Cazic-Thule</s></BLOCKQUOTE><b>Update:</b> After checking into some emails I received last night I have determined that the Cazic-Thule report contained too many inaccuracies to be considered legitimate.  <br><br>Here's the second report from the Nameless server:<BLOCKQUOTE>After three long days in the colossal halls of Veeshan's Peak, we approached<br>the final majestic door that housed the ancient black dragon Phara Dar. I<br>remember how difficult the first dragon of the Ring of Scale was,<br>Silverwing. The mighty silver dragon that guards the halls of the dungeon<br>was a difficult challenge. Each new dragon faced by my band of adventurers<br>was a new and difficult challenge. From the grotesque Hoshkar and his<br>diseased ridden breath to Nexona with her acidic breath. Easily the most<br>difficult dungeon we have ever seen was now nearing its completion. The<br>previous five dragons had all met their makers, and while we were all weary<br>and tired, we pushed ourselves to our limit. We entered the door to Phara<br>Dar himself, the rumored avatar of Veeshan himself.<br><br>We sent our brave Necromancer Ronald down to tempt the dragon to fight, alas<br>Ronald did not survive the taunting. Phara Dar was enraged and charged into<br>our ranks. Her breath seared like wilfefire through our ranks, as warriors<br>and wizards alike writhed in agony. With battle cries in the air we attacked<br>the black beast. Time and again, Phara breathed into our ranks, as many of<br>my comrades fell down dead. As the dragon began to faulter, I cried out<br>excited to see victory within our grasp. Phara Dar did not look beaten<br>however and showed us her breath weapon was not her only weapon, and started<br>to incant a spell. Magically, torn wings began to nit back together and open<br>wounds stopped bleeding and closed before our eyes. At this moment, I<br>despaired that we would die that day. With our backs against the wall, and<br>defeat certain, a frenzy overtook us. We fought like berserkers and cast<br>magical spells with abandon.

In your second point you talk about the feeble guard not being able to kill Young Kodiaks&#8230; And yet, you find opponents of Young Kodiak danger level out in East or West Commons&#8230; <br><br>Yes, the gate guards are the 'newbie' guards for Nektulos. <br><br>And there are other guards that are hunted, take a look out in the Karanas. Head over to Steamfont&#8230; <br><br>I guess my question to you is, why does in matter that those guards are killed? Humans in Freeport have the same level of guard protection in the area that they fight in at that level. I guess I'm confused by your anger at this situation&#8230; <br><br>By the way, I agree about the Lavastorm thing.

Perhaps a bit over my head, intellectually&#8230; <br><br>I think it's wrong to imply that you can only do one or the other, either increase the power of the monsters OR decrease the power of player characters, if your goal is to make the game harder (and that's IF&#8230;). <br><br>The real world answer is that you do both as the situation requires. In the case of one bit of the picture being off, say an item or a spell that makes one class or character type or tactic too powerful, relatively, you obviously reduce the power of that item. If you want to make the world as a whole more difficult for the heroes in it, then you can do either, really. Obviously the preferable method is to increase the AI for the monsters, or find other clever ways to make them more powerful. <br><br>That being said, don't go overboard. If we do something that reduces the power of an item or spell or somesuch, it's done in consideration of the whole. I like to picture class balance as a sort of sea (ok, I've never pictured it that way until just now&#8230;). Waves are expected, even desirable. But when you see a tsunami, what do you do? Do you raise the ocean or lower the wave? Keep in mind that if you raise the ocean you'll drown the world&#8230; <br><br>I love bad analogies. :)</UL>

Gordon stopped by the Gameplay Board today to make a couple of posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035008.html"><b>Downtime Affecting Users Across World</b></a><br>After having addressed many times I wonder if I should keep trying or give up, but I'll give it another short: <br><br>EverQuest is played all over the world. ANY time that we take the servers down will be SOMEONE's primetime. We try to take them down when the fewest number of people will be affected, that will mean taking them down during off-peak time for the America's. <br><br>It's a matter of math. How can we affect the fewest number of people possible? If *peak* was at 4am my time and the low point were at 8pm, we'd take them down at 8pm even though it was primetime here. <br><br>I realize as an off-peak player you don't like this, any more than Americans who play during off-peak like it, but until peak time moves to a time other than the time it is, our scheduled patches will be in the general viscinity of when this one is taking place. I'm sorry, but there is really no other option that makes sense. I've seen people argue that we should stagger patch times so that it falls in someone elses peak every time, but that does not meet the goal of affecting the fewest number of people possible. <br><br>Now, that said, no spawn is "exactly 7 days", nor is it exactly "three days". Any spawn over two hours has a +/- modifier that adjusts its spawn time. That means that the seven day spawn could very well pop up anywhere from six to eight days after it was killed.<br>--<br>It's plus or minus a percentage of the total spawn delay. That means that a two-hour spawn would have a variation of minutes, whereas a 7 day spawn could very well have a variation of days days.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035118.html"><b>Enchanter Pets</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What we want to know now is this. Will enchanter pets be made to dual-wield automatically at the levels you mentioned, just as mage and necro, and shadowknight pets now do? ]</i></font><br><br>In a word: No. <br><br>The enchanter pets consist of a floating sword and shield.

A new message now appears on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>November 29th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems reported by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other gameplay issues:<br><br>- Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum.  Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction.<br><br>- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a player character rather than an NPC.  The change last patch reduced them to a rate below player characters.  As part of this patch, target-specific random effects will only work if the target is the intended type.  For instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" will only "go off" on a summoned NPC instead of everything.  <br><br>- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or two every few minutes.  For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, this should address the issue.<br><br>- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards.  Included in these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it.  <br><br>- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting to get back in.<br><br>- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping is enabled.  Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to release resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable until the next version of DirectX is adopted.<br><br>- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the "NOKEY" setting instead of the "Backspace".  This means that you can now assign "Backspace" to a function in game.<br><br>- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played "rapid-fire" under some circumstances.  There is still a potential for this to happen with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the near future.<br><br>- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult than intended after the server had been up for a while.<br><br>- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability to dual-wield without being handed weapons.  The calculation used to determine whether or not this ability exists takes several things into account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons (higher for the Shadowknight) will have this ability.  It is possible that you could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th level pet that will not have this ability. <br><br>- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant.  Abandon your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune.<br><br>- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill.<br><br>Remember! Only a few days left until the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious.  Reserve your copy at your local retailer today!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

A detailed report of a recent event on the Bertoxxulous server was sent to me today by Iuveniel:<BLOCKQUOTE>Today as we went about our business in the fair city<br>of Firiona Vie, a shout was heard throughout the area<br>proclaiming that the defenders of the city come forth<br>and speak with a man by the name of Danak Dhorentath. <br>Upon arriving at the stone bridge we glimpsed an Iksar<br>figure in the distance, away from the guards.  Curious<br>we went forth to his side and asked what business he<br>had demanding that we come to his call.  Unworried<br>about being surrounded by the Defenders of Firiona<br>Vie, he explained that he had cast a ritual that would<br>shield him from harm and that we would do best to<br>entertain his speech.<br><br>This Iksar, Danak Dhorentath, apparently is<br>responsible for the kidnapping of Firiona Vie and has<br>held her these past six months torturing her for the<br>information only she herself can give up.  Danak<br>talked of the staff that she carried, a blessed weapon<br>of Tunare, and how his necromancer friend Vahlai had<br>discovered a ritual to steal away the Elven Princess'<br>powers.  These powers would be given instead to<br>Vahlai, Danak, and the evil Iksar Venril Sathir.  He<br>spoke of power over all of Norrath and how one person<br>in attendance had the power to stop this ritual,<br>though he never alluded to who it may be except in<br>vague hints and cryptic words.<br><br>This person would be presented a chance at some point<br>to stop the ritual or else claim the power with Danak<br>and rule over Norrath.  The evil being also spoke of<br>Galeth and the Companions returning to the lands of<br>Kunark.  Only time shall tell what the future holds<br>for our world and if Firiona Vie shall be released!<br><br>/ooc This event was wonderfully played out.  The group<br>of people gathered was only 10-15 strong at first, but<br>then began to grow as word spread, although it never<br>exceeded 25.  The GM did a wonderful job of keeping<br>the story VERY interesting and entertaining and I for<br>one am happy that I was able to participate.  One<br>person did attempt to strike down Danak but quickly<br>met his demise.  VERY quickly!  I applaud everyone at<br>the event for doing such a wonderful job roleplaying<br>it out and hope to see you all on the next segment of<br>the tale!<br><br>Attached are some screenshots of the event.<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak4.jpg">Screenshot #4</a><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid975469781,16381,"><b>Event Log</b></a></UL><br>Iuveniel Woodspirit<br>54th Unkempt Druidess<br>Bertoxxulous Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
