</p><p>From the official EQAtlas:
Cast out of the Ring of Scale for reasons that still remain unclear, the red dragon Lord Nagafen has resided for centuries in the fiery depths beneath the LavaStorm Mountains.
</p><p>As Chronicled within the annals of the devout followers of Erollisi Marr known as The Maidens of the Rose, Nagafen, true to his dragon nature exacted a toll in maidens from the people of Qeynos, forcing them to transport one maiden a year across the continent and leave her in his cavern dwelling. This went on for many years, until a pious and beautiful maiden named Erollette - a novice in the temple of Erollisi Marr, the Goddess of Love - was selected. When Erollette sank to the ground before Nagafen, she uttered a final prayer to her goddess, asking only that her sacrifice be the last the maidens of Qeynos must endure.
</p><p>Her bravery and selflessness touched the goddess, who took pity on her. As Nagafen prepared to dine, Erollisi used a golden thread to sew Nagafen's heart to his stomach, twisting his pangs of hunger into pangs of love for Erollette. Under the enchantment, he could not bear to eat her, or anything else - he was lovelorn after all. So he grew hungrier, but the more he starved the more his heart swelled in his chest and the bigger his body became, until he was so huge he could not leave the confines of his cave. He begged her to stay with him, but seeing the dragon was helpless, Erollette rejoiced and returned home to report the good news and dedicate her life to worship."

</p><p><b>Ognit Eznertob</b><br />
Ognit is most happy in a warm, well-furnished study with tomes and papers and tools surrounding him. He is actually known to smile when a formula he has been working with is finally completed. Other than that, he is a grump. His hobby is tinkering with devices and contraptions. Remarkably intelligent, Ognit is cursed with a lust for knowledge that draws him out of his study into the futile world of the mundane everyman.
</p><p>He met his travelling companion Dabner, when a Clockwork Scrubber he was working upon went rogue and attacked him. Dabner heard the commotion and healed Ognit as Ognit blasted the crazed beast. Ognit was most grateful and they spoke for some time over dinner.
</p><p>Ognit could not get rid of Dabner from that point on. As the noon sun warmed the underground caverns of Ak`Anon the temperature rises a scant 0.7 degrees or so. Ognit could predict the arrival of Dabner based on the thermometer on the wall of his study. At noontime, Dabner would finish his morning devotions and check in with Ognit. He would prattle on endlessly about anything that had sparked his interest that morning. At first Ognit viewed the intrusions as a nuisance, but later Ognit began to tolerate the visits, even looked forward to them.
</p><p>He began to count on Dabner's visits. Beyond his taste for rational reasoning, he found himself asking for Dabner's "insight" on certain things, whether they be mechanical, magical, or spiritual. Occasionally his responses were just plain silly in Ognit's eyes. But once in a while he was truly, dead-on accurate about things. Dabner's occasional insights into the nature of the universe were invaluable. From that nebulous point forward, they were the best of friends.
</p><p>Ognit enjoys the stories and jokes that Dabner tells. Occasionally he even laughs. As much as he hates to admit it (and he never will publicly), Dabner is a source of inspiration for him, as well as good company. He also looks on Dabner as a student--albeit a poor one--but he is more than willing to at least try to teach him. Dabner ranks as one of the few people in the world that can actually make him laugh. That being said, Ognit's attitude towards Dabner alternates between one who is a trusted friend and one who is a troublesome nuisance.
</p><p>Ognit's attitude towards Dagda is one of grudging respect on the surface, but true friendship underneath. She is a savage in his eyes and has vowed to protect him because he is "weak", something he takes great exception to. At the same time, he sees her devotion to Dabner and himself as something both noble and worthy of great respect. As one who has spent his life immersed in books and spurning contact with actual people, he has found it a rare thing that others would take a shine to one such as he. Furthermore, it makes him happy to see that his friend Dabner has such a powerful ally, given his inherent weakness in mind and naivete. If you really pressed him, he would admit that Dagda is his friend and with a bit of prodding, she would do the same. They share an intense, almost sibling-like, rivalry and he and Dagda argue often about anything and everything. However, their conversations are the most lively and indeed even friendly when they are discussing something he is tinkering. 
</p><p><i>The Heater</i>
A commotion erupted near the warm camp fires in the cave leading to Halas as a pair of gnomes scurried out into the cold carrying odd looking equipment. Dagda Icefury, a barbarian woman strong and heavily armored, shouted out over the frozen tundra of Everfrost, "Come and see my brothers and sisters! My friends have made for us a device that will keep us warm on the frigid tundra! Follow me and see this wonderful invention! We shall never know cold again!"
</p><p>A pair of gnomes stood near the Igloos. One wore robes and a grim face, riddled with lines indicative of one who thinks a bit too much. Another in light chain, grinned ear to ear. Tools and small bits of oddly shaped metal littered the ground and were slowly disappearing under the perpetual snowfall. The air smelled of volatile substances.
</p><p>Dagda lead a group of curious onlookers to the igloos located some distance away from the small settlement that is Halas. The gnome, Ognit Eznertob, both a wizard as well as a tinker like most of his kind, waved them all forward impatiently. As they approached he said, "Oh good, you're here, Dagda. And I'm happy to see that you've brought some friends along."
</p><p>The crowd began to gather and surround Ognit. The barbarians towered over the strange gnome, who turned and climbed atop the Igloo. Waving his arms, he called for quiet. "Quit your yammering already and listen!" He tapped his feet for a few moments as the crowd quieted.
</p><p>Making himself as tall as he could, he puffed out his chest and said, "Thank you Dagda for gathering your kin to come and experience what will surely be a life changing revolution for all of you who dwell in these inhospitable lands." He nodded toward Dagda as his face contorted into a failed attempt at a smile. 
</p><p>His face fell once again into a perpetual scowl as he continued in his scratchy voice with all the flare of a carnival huckster. "Never again shall the elements take the lives of those who dwell in this harsh terrain you call, most appropriately, Everfrost. We have heard in our conversations with the residents of Halas, that some of the young Wolves of the North have succumbed to the cold of this region."
</p><p>Gesturing broadly, he continued, "As a favor to our close friend Dagda and indeed as a favor to all of you and your kin who reside in these lands of persistent inclemency, I have developed the blueprints for a device that will make an end to the wretched misery you poor folks face."
</p><p>With excitement in his voice, he said, "But before we get to that, more about me! I have, as a master tinker, made it my goal to design and build life-enhancing tools to make Norrath a better place."
</p><p>"Some devices just treat the symptom and ignore the cause, such as my automatic, self-applicating, single use, disposable tissues for cold climates such as these." Ognit sneezed and a thin cloth sprang out from somewhere beneath his robes and stuck to his face.
</p><p>The gnome let loose a muffled cry of surprise. Removing the cloth from his face he said, "Pardon me," and continued his pitch. "As I was saying this device does more than simply treat the symptom. This device eliminates the cause of the problem altogether! With no further ado, I would like to introduce my close friend and understudy in all things mechanical, Dabner Drednever," he then gestured down to the gnome in light chain armor waiting below next to the igloo.
</p><p>Dabner sat there, staring in fear at the crowd of giants all around him. Ognit bends down and whispers loudly, "Get up on this igloo and talk to these people, you cretin!"
</p><p>"Though I designed the blueprints for this device, Dabner here is the one solely responsible for its assembly. This is his first work as a tinker and he's very excited to tell you about what he did," Ognit added, buying himself some more time.
</p><p>Dabner climbed on top of the igloo, while Ognit slid down the other side. Being above all of these people didn't make things any easier for Dabner. He suddenly realized how many there were. He cleared his throat uncomfortably.
</p><p>Ognit pointed at Dabner and mouths the words, "Get on with it all ready!"
</p><p>Seeing her little friend's distress, Dagda said, "Tell them about what you made Dabner! You know I'm proud of you!"
</p><p>Visibly blushing, Dabner spoke, his voice cracking nervously, "Yeah... So this is the first thing that I made… With tinkering that is…"
</p><p>Dabner looked down and shuffled his feet nervously. "I think you're all gonna like it. It'll keep you all warm and it fits in a small backpack and stuff… So that's good..."
</p><p>Ognit looked up at Dabner and then covering his eyes and shaking his head says, "You're dying up there Dabner! Flare, think flare! Like you're giving a sermon or some fool thing like that."
</p><p>At those harsh words, Dagda turned a dangerous glare upon Ognit. Ognit ignored the look.
</p><p>Building some steam Dabner continued, "Ognit here designed it and stuff but I put it together myself! So now, here it is, I guess!" He smiled nervously as he rifled through a  backpack. Finding what he was searching for, he pulled out a small device. It was a cylindrical shape that appeared to be made out of interlaced metal wire. The top of the device had what looked to be a weather vein that seemed to spin on its own regardless of the wind's direction. The center of the object seemed to glow a light orange color.
</p><p>Sliding gleefully off the igloo, he placed the object on the ground. Dabner then reached into his pocket and pulled out another device, this one a small box- rectangular, thin and long. Taking several steps back, he pointed the device at the cylinder and clicked a small red button on the box.
</p><p>Upon hitting the button, huge flames shot out in all directions from the cylinder. The shock wave from the mighty explosion rolled across the tundra. Animals stopped dead in their tracks in fear as the sound echoed throughout the hills. The crowd gasped and took several steps back. Some people began to draw weapons.
</p><p>Smiling broadly at the shocked crowd, Dabner continued, "So… Here I am standing down here and I'm all cold and what have you. But, I have this nice Portable Heater I set up over by this igloo here."
</p><p>"Now," Dabner eyes gleamed with confidence. I want to get all nice and warm so I guess I'll go over by my heater I got set up over here." Dabner smiled once again at the crowd as he strode up to the portable heater and said, "Heh." As he approached the heater, the spinning object atop the device stopped  spinning and began to point directly toward him.
</p><p>As Dabner stood next to the heater, a wave of flame shot forth from between the wires of the cylinder, and enveloped Dabner briefly before dying down. "Oh yeah. That's nice and warm all right," he said with confidence.
</p><p>The spinner began to spin once again and once again it stopped, pointing at Dabner. Another burst of flame shot forth and enveloped the gnome. "Yup, that's heating my armor up good now."
</p><p>Dabner looked apprehensively at the heater, which shot yet another wave of fire at the gnome. Finally he jumped back shouting, "Sweet Brell's pajamas that's hot!"
</p><p>Ognit's face was screwed into a scowl of rage; "You used the Size 6 Gizmo didn't you? Please tell me you didn't use Size 6 Gizmos in this contraption when I told you specifically to use the Size 4 Gizmos!" He poked Dabner several times with his bony finger.
</p><p>Dabner looked down at the snow, "Well… I thought that the Size 6 Gizmo would be better so I used those. You know. The Size 4 Gizmos are so small and hard to work with, after all." Looking up sheepishly, he added, "It was like… artistic license, you know?"
</p><p>"Impetuous dolt! You didn't make a heater! You've laid a land mine!" Ognit clenched his fist as his whole body shook, his face twisting with rage. 
</p><p>Dagda stepped forward, separating the two gnomes. Turning to Ognit she said, "Calm down, you old grump! And don't yell at Dabner like that!" Walking toward the portable heater she looked behind to the gnomes and said smugly, "It can't be all that bad! You are so small after all. It makes sense that it would be too hot for you. Let me try it out. It may still prove useful for us more hearty folk." Several in the crowd nodded in agreement and looked on with continuing interest.
</p><p>As Dagda approached the heater, the spinner once again stopped spinning and began to point toward Dagda. The heater once again erupted into a virtual inferno and Dagda's upper body disappeared into the flames and smoke.
</p><p>She remained in the flames for a few seconds but then backed away. The flames subsided and the spinner spun once again. "Wow," she said, as she ducked to brush snow onto her armor. The snow hissed as steam rose into the air. "That's really far too hot."
</p><p>Dagda looked sadly at Dabner and then with anger at Ognit. Shaking her head, she drew forth her bow, "That device is dangerous and must be destroyed."
</p><p>Ognit was indignant, "Dagda! What are you doing?"
</p><p>"Not a word from you wizard. This thing must be destroyed. It is a danger to us all," she said as she began to launch arrow after arrow into the device. Others joined in and soon arrows, rocks, throwing stars and spells were flying through the air and striking the heater. Wringing his hands Dabner said, "I'm so sorry Ognit. I should have followed your blueprint," as their invention was slowly reduced to a smoldering hunk of metal bits. "Size 6!" Ognit yelled at the sky. "I tell him use Size 4. So what does he do? He uses Size 6." "I'm really sorry, Ognit," Dabner was truly penitent.
</p><p>The heater fully destroyed and rendered inactive, Dagda put her bow away and said, "I'm sorry I had to destroy your heater Dabner. Ognit should have been watching you more carefully."
</p><p>Shuffling his feet and smiling, Dabner said, "That's ok, Dagda, it was my fault after all." Her face changed from sadness at having to disappoint Dabner to anger at the other gnome as she says, "What kind of rotten teacher are you to allow YOUR student to do such a thing, Ognit?"  Standing on his tiptoes, he pointed a wrinkled finger at himself and says, "Me? You're blaming me for this monstrosity! My designs are rock-solid and based on extensive research!"
</p><p>"Maybe you should stick to research then and leave instruction to those who know more about that kind of thing," she said in a mocking tone, her head tilting back and forth with each syllable. 
</p><p>Stamping his feet Ognit bellowed, "I can train a common cur to follow basic instructions! Why can't he follow them?" "I can live with your failings Ognit. That is why I have vowed to protect you after all," she said crossing her arms, a slight smile beginning to cross her face. "Yeah! Well the last thing I need is protection from the likes of you," Ognit growled, his fists forced down by his sides, shaking violently.
</p><p>This time, Dabner stepped between the two of them, "C'mon guys! Stop fighting! You know I hate that! See now! No one got hurt…" He paused for a second and then added, "Well, except for that guy lying on the ground over there. But we are all friends and stuff here, right? Relax already! I'm not mad or upset or anything. No reason for you guys to be!" 
</p><p>Ognit and Dagda muttered a few one-line insults to themselves but eventually ceased their arguing. It was then that Dagda's keen and well-trained eyes caught a glimpse of several figures walking slowly across the snowy wastes. She turned and looked at the approaching figures, her eyes flashing in startled recognition. Curious she made her way toward the figures, the two gnomes flanking her on either side.
</p><p>As her eyes meet those of the beautiful golden haired high elf before her, Dagda was sure she was seeing a friend but could not remember who she was or how she knew her. The high elf was accompanied by what must have been half elven bard, judging from the lute slung across her back. The bard also seemed eerily familiar to her. In fact, the erudite in robes, the human resplendent in shining armor, the young scruffy looking halfling and the scowling dwarf all seemed familiar to her for some reason. But the shy wood elf carrying the exquisitely crafted and ornately decorated bow, she did not recognize. [for more of this story, see the Chronicals of Firiona Vie]

Perhaps a woman with a double life, she heads both the wizards guild and the necromancer’s guild in Freeport. 
</p><p><b>Orc</b><br /> 
Orcs are a brutal yet prolific humanoid race that can be found in nearly every corner of Norrath. Brutish and feudal in nature, several Orc clans have reached rather sophisticated levels of society, most notably, Clan Crushbone of the Greater Faydark.  They were originally slaves of the ogres.
</p><p>Little more then three months after their betrayal of Dagnor and their march to the east, the newly freed orcan slaves were left stranded with no place to call home. None of the orcs had ever lived without the watchful eye of an ogre master looking over their shoulder, so now they were like children: wandering without knowing exactly what they were to do. The dwarves had made it clear in their pact that, while the kingdom of Kaladim was responsible for freeing the orcs, they were still very much enemies. It was not an option for any of the orcs to return west, so they eached began plotting for a new place to live. 
</p><p>The decision was split three ways and the orcs began to revert back to the methods of their ancestors: splitting into three differing clans. One clan marched north, taking residence in the familiar northern peaks of Rakthok's ridge and away from the careful eyes of the dwarves. The second clan decided to make the grassy fields of the loping plains their home. Even today this clan remains there, looting and plundering any caravans who happen to pass by. The third, and the largest clan, was lead by a young orc named Gharol. He convinced the majority of the orcs that true riches lied to the fertile lands of the east. There, he said, the orcs would find their new home and the crushbone clan, as he called his followers, would grow strong. 
</p><p>It was at this time, as the crushbone clan started making their way further east around the wayunder lake and straight for the greater Faydark, that the elven lord of Kelethin began to take notice of their advancement. 
</p><p><i>Kelethin Orcs:</i><br />
Of the border struggles and the great burning:<br /> 
</p><p>The elves of Kelethin were tentative at first and the lord of Kelethin, an old elf by the name of Carandril, sent many messages to Gharol to ask what his plans were in moving his clan eastward. To this day no scholar can really be sure if Gharol was able to decipher the letters or not, as it is general knowledge that most orcs can't read a word of any written language, but it is certain the orcan lord was angry to find that another race had already taken residence in the eastern lands. Carandril never saw any messengers he sent out again, as they were all killed by Gharol immediately as the letters were exchanged. Acting purely on his instincts, the leader of the crushbone clan told his followers of this "new" race and how they had "stolen" the east from the orcs. Gharol then started to plot a new plan which would entail the complete destruction of Kelethin and the enslavement of the elven race, as he thought kelethin was the only city of elves and the center for the entire elven empire. 
</p><p>Both assumptions were false and the forces of Gharol were met with bitter, however surprised, resistance on the borders of the greater faydark. Most of the orcs leading this first attack were killed and the rest were turned quickly away. Angry at this new defeat and jealous of the elven strength, Gharol started to plot a new system of attack. He understood that most of his soldiers had been slaughtered from elves high in the treetops who would rain showers of arrows down on his forces. So for the second attack, Gharol put his orcs into a long line of attackers, gave each soldier his own makeshift torch, and then ordered the entire host to run into the borders of the greater Faydark and burn whatever they could touch. The Crushbone orcs set fire from everything to the tops of the trees to the grasses on the forest paths. Nothing but ash was left in their wake. The elven archers high in the trees were burned to death and the remaining elven soldiers, horrified and shocked at the tactics of their strange enemy, began to make a hasty retreat. The wood elves would later call the incident "the great burning." Gharol, seeing how effective his new methods were, gathered his clan into many small camps around the greater Faydark and ordered the construction of hundreds of torches for a second assault. The lord of Kelethin, desperate for help, sent word of his plight to the heart of the empire: Felwithe. 
</p><p>The first elf to take interest in Kelethin's request was a young soldier named Edril. Edril had lived his entire life in Felwithe, schooled by the best teachers and raised in a wealthy family. Around his 30th birthday, young by elven standards, he admitted himself into the imperial school of soldiery where he impressed his teachers with both his knowledge of military science and his deadly accurate fighting skills. After graduating and performing many deeds of merit in the imperial army of the elves, he was chosen as a personal guard of the emperor at the unprecedented age of 50. What brought him everlasting fame among the elves, however, was not how he excelled in schooling but what he chose to do for Kelethin. Going straight to the emperor himself, Edril asked that he be allowed to lead the attack against the orcs. When the emperor granted his wish, Edril hand picked 100 of the best elven warriors and the best horses, and rode quickly to the woodland kingdom of Kelethin. 
</p><p>He was met at Kelethin with a large reception, but decided to ride through quickly. He was there for only one purpose: to make a name for himself by destroying the orcs. Little more then two days after arriving in the city, Edril and his men rode outside the greater Faydark and headed directly for the first orcan encampment. It was the middle of the night when Edril made his first strike, and the orcs were completely caught off guard. Edril's men rode straight over the orcs, slaughtering every clansmen they saw with little casualties of their own. Edril is said to have fought like a madman, tallying over 20 kills himself. Without even stopping to catch their breath, Edril's soldiers rode for the next camp so as to keep the element of surprise. 
</p><p>One by one the camps of the crushbone orcs were destroyed quickly and brutally. The orcs, still preparing for their second assault on Kelethin, were always caught by surprise. Edril and his men moved from one battle to the next so quickly, the elves called them the legion of wind. The strategy worked perfectly: Gharol was never able to get word of the new attackers in time to plan a defense and so most of the orcs were slaughtered. The final battle, lasting longer then the rest, was against Gharol's own camp. Many of Edril's warriors were killed in this fight but all of the orcs, including Gharol, were driven away to the deep growth of the wild Greater Faydark. Here they have made their makeshift kingdom. When Edril returned to his kingdom, he was proclaimed high protector of Kelethin with over 150 kills to his name alone. This would not be the last time Edril's name was written into elven history, however. It is believed that only weeks later after their retreat, Gharol was killed by his own followers.
