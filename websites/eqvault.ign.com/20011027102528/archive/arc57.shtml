From Brimstone:<BLOCKQUOTE>I just wanted to pass along an update regarding the Online Gaming Store,<br>"MMORPGSTUFF.com". We now feature larger shirt sizes that range from<br>children's 'small' to adult XXXXL. In the past, our store only offered up to<br>XL, and this alienated several people from buying shirts. <br><br>I also wanted to say that we will create shirts (and other stuff) based on the<br>ideas from the gaming community. If your idea is implemented (and most are),<br>we will give you $20.00 for every $100.00 earned in profits. It may take a few<br>months, but free money is a great thing! <br><br>Also, if you belong to a clan, guild, fan site, etc. and want some custom<br>shirts, mugs or mousepads created -- we do that too. Oftentimes, your items<br>can be created and shipped out within a week or two. <br><br>Some example images of the merchandise:<br><br><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/druidex/tshirt_designA.jpg?701.4953931511698">http://www.cafepress.com/druidex/tshirt_designA.jpg?701.4953931511698</a><br><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/sowplz/tshirtb_designA.jpg?474.3524149492869">http://www.cafepress.com/sowplz/tshirtb_designA.jpg?474.3524149492869</a><br><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/helpnerf/mousepad_designA.jpg?444.25947886868244">http://www.cafepress.com/helpnerf/mousepad_designA.jpg?444.25947886868244</a><br><br>Thank you for your time and interest!!!<br><br>Brimstone,<br>Founder, MMORPGSTUFF.com<br><a href="http://www.mmorpgstuff.com">http://www.mmorpgstuff.com</a><br>Email: brimstone@lostorder.com</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

On the Arena Board, Lady Dae made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000040.html">the following announcement</a>:<UL><i>Verant Interactive Presents<br>The Test of Tactics &#8211; Best of the Best Event<br><br>The Test of Tactics was the first official event held by Verant Interactive, being held over a year ago on Xegony. The event is designed as a 6 vs 6 event, with minimal amounts of rules involved. Due to the massive time cost on the event, it was decided upon to move to smaller events that would take less time to run and place a smaller burden on the server staff.<br><br>With the incredible demand that the players have shown for the events, we are going to bring back the Test of Tactics, and do a Best of the Best for all servers to find the greatest 6-man team. We have modified the rules slightly so that we don&#8217;t have 200 teams per server enter, and it will be able to be run quickly and efficiently, while still trying to keep the original spirit of the event alive.<br><br>The 6-man team has now become a 7-man team. The &#8220;Captain&#8221; of the team must be a level 58 or higher. Two &#8220;Elite&#8221; team members need to be 55 or higher. The final 4 of the team make up 3 &#8220;Support&#8221; team members of 49th level plus, and a &#8220;Substitute/Coach&#8221; position that can be of any level. This does allow for a 7-man team of all 60th level players.<br><br>Only 6 will fight at one time, and the 7th can be substituted before the match. Once the team has been chosen, those 6 must fight. The 7th during the match is restricted to observation or coaching.<br><br>Rules are fairly simple. No starting buffs, no starting pets, no use of fear, no use of charm, and no use of knock back spells. Once the match starts, you may buff, summon pets, use activatable items, cast spells, engage with melee, hide and sneak, disarm opponents, use uber-quest weapons, do whatever is needed to assure the victory of your team.<br><br>The &#8220;Ring&#8221; for this match is the raised platform of the arena. The only characters allowed in the center arena is the 12 players involved, and the Lead Judge of the event. All players involved must remain in the tiles at all times. Leaving the tiles for any reason will result in a warning, then disqualification of the player involved.<br><br>Security for this event will be extreme. Any non-combatant who even stands up on the raised platform will be removed from the arena and banished from the event. No spell casting, no bard song, no use of shout will be tolerated at anytime for those watching the event. Event Staff can and will remove any player that causes even the slightest disruption of this massive event. <br><br>Before the claims of uber-guild, uber-item, uber-whatever start, be advised that of the 3 Test of Tactics that have been held, the team that has practiced the most have won these events, even over higher levels, better equipped, and longer playing characters. How well you understand the basics of 6 vs 6 player vs player combat, and getting a well balanced team will determine how well your group does in the event.<br><br>The ToT-BotB will start October 16th and run through October 28th on Live Servers. The final event will be a 2-day event on Test Server, October 28th and 29th.<br><br>Prizes for this incredible event are still undecided, as well as the question of an entry fee. This will be discussed and made final in the next week.<br><br>Good luck to everyone participating, I shall see you on the battlefields!<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Events Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive</i></UL>

Could this be why I always get dropped when I zone?]</i></font> <br><br>The client doesn't check back with the login server when zoning. As many are aware, we've taken the login server down several times while leaving all of the game servers up. If this was the case, people would get kicked out in masses any time we did this. <br><br>I'm not sure why you get dropped when you zone. You might consider deleting all of your OPT files in your EverQuest directory (you'll have to reset customizations). You should also run a "Thorough File Check" from the patch program. <br><br>What speed is your connection?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019686.html"><b>Ragebringers Too Easy</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are Ragebringers so "Easy"?]</i></font> <br><br>Essentially, the designer was a little optimistic. It became a little more difficult in the last patch and will probably undergo several more adjustments in the near future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019789.html"><b>Trade Robbing</b></a><br>My best advice is to be careful. Be sure that the person you are trading with is the one who is actually intended to receive the items. Sure, we don't want to see the activity mentioned in the beginning occuring, at the same time we don't want to see equally despicable players setting unsuspecting people up and using the GMs as an offensive tool. <br><br>The best offense is a strong defense. You are ultimately responsible for who you hand your items to.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019815.html"><b>Item Duping</b></a><br>I sincerely doubt that there are any game-damaging dupes out there. We've had the reward offer out there for some time, and only received one that was verifiable, and that was a dupe of soulbound items which are all nodrop anyway. <br><br>Here's a copy of the reward offer: <br><br>Hello all, <br><br>For those who are new to online games, a &#8220;dupe&#8221; is a bug that allows<br>a player to &#8220;duplicate&#8221; or &#8220;copy&#8221; items, creating two items where once<br>there was one. We've heard some reports that there may be a dupe bug<br>somewhere in game. While we're confident that we do not have any current<br>issues of this type, we'd like to provide an incentive to everyone to<br>report such things should they become aware of them. <br><br>The FIRST person to submit reproduction steps for any dupe bug will<br>receive the following: a) A free EverQuest account. We'll mark your<br>current account as free, or provide you with a new, free account,<br>and b) Subject to approval by us, the title of your choice will be<br>applied to one of the characters on your account. <br><br>To qualify, you must include all of the information below. Furthermore,<br>THE REPRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE CLEAR, CONCISE, AND PRESENT<br>LOGICAL STEPS ALLOWING OUR TEST DEPARTMENT TO REPRODUCE THE BUG.<br>Send an email with a subject line of "Dupe Bug Report" to<br><a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a> containing the following: <br><br>1. Station Name<br>2. Real Name<br>3. Phone Number (Day and Evening)<br>4. Primary Play Server<br>5. Primary Character Name<br>6. Complete reproduction instructions. <br><br>&#8220;Dupe Bug Reports&#8221; will only be considered if they contain all necessary<br>elements of information including complete instructions for reproducing<br>the bug. While we appreciate notification of all potential problems,<br>only concrete first-hand experiences will be considered for the award.</UL>

The following contains Gordon's latest post to the official Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010981-4.html"><b>PvP</b></a><br>There are a lot of spells out there that are nearly unresistable. I really don't have first-hand experience with these spells, but if that's the case, I'll take your word for it. <br><br>I noticed that the thread is mostly bumps wanting some sort of comment about it, but I really don't have any.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019818.html"><b>GM Corruption</b></a><br>Why is it that you assume that there is some favoritism going on every time someone gets something over on a GM? It happens sometime. I wish that it didn't, because if it did we'd be able to take players word for things on a broader basis, but unfortunately it does happen. <br><br>It doesn't sound like from what you've said here that the person should have gotten a res. That said, it is only a third of the story. I'm sure that there is something here which we here on the boards are not privy to.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019832.html"><b>Pet Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Long ago, when Mage pets were *not* dual-wielding, and the Focus items were introduced; Mages received a number of mid-level and high-level items.<br><br>Necromancers received only 1 high-level item, off of a God [Innoruuk] no less. Reason? Necromancers are strong enough as it is--by GZ.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, the same answer still applies. Regardless of what has happened with mages and focus items, necros are still strong enough. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019798.html"><b>Gone for a Day Over the Weekend</b></a><br>What's sad is that if I go away for the weekend, and have access to a computer while I'm there, I still come here and post. Just can't drag myself away :)  Maybe people will understand why I take the "you don't care" posts too well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019712-2.html"><b>Wizard's Epic Quest</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Thanks to the efforts of hackers, everyone who has bothered to look the info up knows what their FA weapon will do as its "special property".]</i></font> <br><br>And thanks to the effort of Javier, the game designer looking after the spell database these days, the hackers didn't get very far. Javier put a ton of red herrings in the spell database to keep them busy. <br><br>As to the person who broke the display of the the thread with your "hahaha" and subsequent flaming, you should check your email tomorrow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019757.html"><b>Blighted Drops</b></a><br>Each type of NPC that can drop a particular kind of armor has a percentage chance to spawn. Once spawned, each has a percentage change of dropping a particular item. <br><br>These percentages cannot be considered average over a single plane clearing. It really can't be considered an average over 10. Perhaps 100 is more likely to give a meaningful average. <br><br>If you look at the posts here on the board, you'll see that different servers complain about different drops in the planes. This suggests pretty well that drops are working appropriately. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019733.html"><b>Gargantuan Spider Leg Quest</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Come on fix the Gargantuan spider leg quest]</i></font> <br><br>It was fixed over a month ago.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019584.html"><b>Server Split Moves Guaranteed?</b></a><br>I wouldn't say anything along these lines is "guaranteed". I would say that if we guaranteed the moves that there would be a very good possibility we'd end up crowding the other server. The possibility of being split up from friends is about the only thing that keeps the numbers manageable. <br><br>Anyway, I've asked Ops for counts from both MithMarr and Tunare, and should know if we'll be able to move everyone soon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019710.html"><b>Large Races Being Punished?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are large races being punished?]</i></font> <br><br>Because they have so many other advantages.

Illanae Willowsbane passed the following message that was posted to our Povar board along:<BLOCKQUOTE>So many of you responded when you heard of Dawn.... the child of two of my <br>EverQuest guildmates. The few minutes you took from your day to visit her <br>website at <a href="http://www.dawnspage.com/">http://www.dawnspage.com/</a> and leave a message for her on the <br>message board there have meant more to the little girl than any of you could <br>possibly imagine! <br><br>Here is what her father had to say about it..... <br><br>"The response we have gotten is wonderful. The many posts have helped lift <br>Dawn to a new high. She is ready to face this thing head on and beat it. I <br>honestly have not seen her this ready to face this disease since she was <br>first diagnosed with it over five years ago. There are not enough words, and <br>I am not sure there are the right words to express what an impact this has <br>made on me and the rest of the family. <br><br>I do have to ask that if you have stopped by and left her a message to please <br>keep doing so. Starting Oct 12 she starts a minimum of four months in the <br>hospital and I know that any words of encouragement during this phase are <br>going to help." <br><br>And here is a message from her mother ........ <br><br>"We have learned that we are going to Denver on the 9th of October to get <br>ready for the transplant. I am so glad of all the support I have seen and I <br>Thank-you ALL very much! Please keep the messages coming in. Dawn really <br>likes it and some of them make us work even harder to do our best at eating <br>and keeping in good health. I am touched at how many people could care about <br>a little girl that they don't know except what they have seen on her webpage. <br>And wish to encourage you to keep writing and hope with all the messages she <br>will pull through a little harder. As of right now she is doing her best to <br>please not just herself and family but everyone that has writen her and <br>wished her good luck and keep her spirits high. I can't Thank-you enough and <br>will Thank-you for as long as I can." <br><br>========================================================= <br><br>Dawn has suffered from Acute Lymphoblastlic Leukemia for five years now and <br>she was diagnosed with her second relapse in April of this year after only <br>having gone into remission about a year ago. The doctors have said that it is <br>likely she will only survive this round of the fight if the upcoming bone <br>marrow transplant is successful. The pain and suffering this young child has <br>endured is incomprehensible to most of us.... she can pronounce the correct <br>names of prescription drugs and understands more medical procedures than most <br>adults <br><br>Dawn goes to Denver on Tuesday the 3rd of October to get a check-up and tests <br>done. Then she goes to Denver again on the 9th of October to get ready to <br>start the process for her transplant. That starts on Oct. 10th with <br>outpatient radiation and then she will be admitted on the 12th to start her <br>chemo and everything else to clear her body of lekumia cells so that the bone <br>marrow transplant will take. <br><br>Please take a moment to leave her a message.... little things can mean so <br>much! </BLOCKQUOTE>Awesome, I hope everyone can help out! :)

There are thousands of quests completed every hour, and doing this would have a severe impact on their ability to do their job. <br><br>GMs can, after the fact, see what happened, but keep in mind that they do not have write-ups of all of the quests available. When there is a broken quest (which incidently there are very few of these days), they become aware of them, but normally working quests are not on a list for GMs to view or confirm. <br><br>Yes, I agree that GMs should not leave mid-conversation, but he could very well have been zoning or away from the keyboard for subsequent tells. It's very possible that he thought the conversation was over. <br><br>If you feel you've had a problem with CS, please email <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.comeqmail@verant.com</a>. It will be forwarded to the appropriate personnel. I'd appreciate it if you could indicate at the top of your email that your suspicion regarding the quest was incorrect, as otherwise it's libel to be forwarded to the reimbursement issue queue rather than customer service management.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019411.html"><b>Most Powerful Pet Throught Process</b></a><br>Certain classes, specifically pet classes are designed with soloing in mind. Those pets are important for that purpose. The pets do not, however, eclipse the need for tanks in a grouping situation where tanks are generally needed, which means that there isn't an imbalance. <br><br>Pets actually become less useful in many dungeon-going groups due to the difficulty in controling them in tense situations.

Why is such a powerful npc in a newbie zone ?]</i></font> <br><br>Simply, there are no newbie zones, not from the standpont of the story. Sure, you normally find lower level stuff closer to the cities as a matter of gameplay, but when trying to develop a story we cannot always adhere to these rigid structures. <br><br>People talk all the time about how neat it would be for cities to get invaded and taken over, but we can't necessarily have that happen if we're restricted to using level 1 to 4 NPCs because it's a "newbie zone". It wouldn't make much sense for the high-level nasties with a plan to only hang out in the sparsely populated outer areas. <br><br>For the purpose of presenting a story, it may be necessary to have some high level critters running around a zone that's been considered relatively safe. It's part of our goal to bring the story to the players and have them participate in it. Certainly some people will be caught in the crossfire, but it's just part of the game. I hope that we can continue to please more people than we upset in the process.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019397.html"><b>Allowing Items into the World</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How do you get items into the world at a rate of 1 every 20 hours, without requiring the player to spend that long staring at an empty spawn point?]</i></font> <br><br>You don't. Perhaps the only way to get a quest that has 10 2-hour steps without having the items come in at the 2-hour rate is to have it so that step 1 cannot be attempted again until the completion of step 10. That way a person going through the quest would encounter 10, 2 hour steps, but the next person wouldn't be able to start until the first completed the quest. <br><br>The problem here is that the second person could certainly choose to camp at the spot for 18 hours waiting for his "turn" to come up. Not to mention, what is there to do if the first person decides to quit halfway through...</UL>

Jeannette brings us the following announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>***Blackburrow Triage Event**<br><br>&#8220;BAAARRRRRRRKKKKK!&#8221;<br><br>It was a familiar howling cry that ripped through the Qeynos night.  Zsalshun stood up and waited for the inevitable as the howl of the hunt bounced off the stone walls of the city.  In the dark there were cries of pain as the pack tore through the young adventurers, even as the guards rushed out to slay the encroaching  dogs.  The priestess called upon the powers of her dark god to help the unfortunates in the way of the reckless charge but still some were lost.  The guard came back to his post with the fire of hate burning in his eyes.<br><br>&#8220;Those Darkpaws grow ever bolder and we don&#8217;t have the manpower to exterminate them in that black den of theirs!&#8221; <br><br>The Tier &#8216;Dal priestess cast her dark lord&#8217;s protections on a recently mauled fighter and sent him healed and on his way.  The citizens had come to tolerate her and on occasions such as this even respect the power granted to her by Innoruuk.<br><br>&#8220;These gnolls have taken quite a bite out of the citizens here.  I think it might be time for the citizens to start taking back.&#8221;  The priestess raised an eyebrow at the guard.  He looked at her uncertainly.<br><br>&#8220;Their den is a hive of traps and they are as thick as Inkies in Neriak in there.  No offense.&#8221;<br><br>Zsalshun sighed and thought a bit.  &#8220;House Winterborne can provide protection and aid to the townsfolk.  That might help and I am sure there are several young adventurers who are looking for revenge on these dogs.  We have healers, casters and respectable warriors who can insure a margin of safety for an all out assault.&#8221;  She tapped a finger absently on her mace.  &#8220;Yes, I think that with our help, the citizens of Qeynos can finally charge into Black Burrow and take back some of which the gnolls have taken.&#8221;<br><br>The guard smiled grimly.  &#8220;I wish you all the luck.  May the gods smile on your plans.&#8221;<br><br><br>OOC:  Monday, October 2nd at 8:30 EST  House Winterborne of the Xegony server will be providing aid for any adventurer wanting to assault the Darkpaw gnolls in their home of Blackburrow.  We shall  assist those in Blackburrow by healing, buffing, providing bandages, food and drink as well as the esteemed services of our warriors for train breaking.  We invite you to come spend an evening stopping the gnoll scourge at the starting point:  Their own home den.  We have no delusions that the gnolls will be exterminated, but for one evening we can definitely help with the thinning of their ranks. </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
