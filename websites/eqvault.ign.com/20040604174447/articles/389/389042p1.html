We've got a lot of special guests in tonight. I'd like to introduce my first guests, four lovely ladies all the way from Lesser Faydark, the Nybright Sisters!"
*more appluase*
"Hello ladies"
"Hi Ziffy!"
"The Nybrights are bandits by trade, nothing wrong with that mind, but they say that people keep ganging up on them and taking their necklaces. So girls, just what is it with these necklaces then? Could we get a close-up on those? Ok."
*audience goes oooooh!*
"Well Ziffy, you know, we're just some girls, yeah? We like to hang out and stuff, but our pop keeps getting mad at us for staying out late and dating guys and stuff, and he keeps paying people to kill us and take our necklaces."
"Yeah, he sucks!"
"Yeah, I mean he gave us these in the first place. He should just lighten up, you know?"
"Yes girls, I can see that must be a problem. Well, we have a little surprise for you."
*cut to inset with glowering High Elf*
"We've invited your pop on to the show, here he is, Poppa Nybright!"
*crowd goes crazy as glowering High Elf enters studio*
"Hello Mr Nybright, thats it take a seat. So, you're paying people to kill your own daughters then?" *crowd boos*
"Well, Ziffy, They never shown me NO respect, cos they is just filthy whores!"
*Sister grabs chair, swings at Pops, stage crew wade in to break up fight, crowd loves it*
"Okay, okay, let's just settle down. Ladies? What do have to say to that?"
"I say he has to EARN that respect! He never did nothing for us ever and we're better off without him!" *Pops leaps up and is skilfully intercepted by stage crew*
"Okay, I can see you folks have a lot to work out. Join us, after the break, when I'll be talking to two Ogres from Butcherblock who say everyone wants their heads! See you soon!"
*more applause*
*cheesey music*

*Two Ogres stomp on to stage*
"So hi there guys, thats it, take a seat. Oh. Can we have some more seats here? Ok. So, you say that everybody wants to take off your heads, is that it?"

I sez dat dis is our new home. Den dey git real mad and start frowin axes at us and stuff. Me use da mojo to make dem run, but now dey hirin adventu...adventro...peeple to come an barsh me and Corny here, and to get me hed!"
"And a lovely head it is too. Well, we've invited Thor Gudrunsonsonson, from the Kaladim PR Office on to the show, come in Thor!"
*scowling Dwarf stomps on to stage*
"Good evening Thor. So help me out here, just exactly what is it about these Ogres that you dont like? I mean they seem pretty decent folk?"
*Dwarf glares at Ogres*
"You don't know the half of it, Ziffy. HAve you been to Butcherblock lately?"
"Not recently, I've been very busy elsewhere, why?"
"Well, they're making it a mess, they chant loudly late into the night, they leave offal and entrails hanging from trees in picturesque spots. You have to undertand Ziffy, Kaladim depends very heavily on its tourist industry, from Antonica and these two bums are just scaring folks away!"
"Duh..."
*Zarchoomi stands and starts shreiking incoherently at the Dwarf*
"Well Thor, you're not exactly a comforting sight yourself? You are a woman, yes?"
*sticks out beard defiantly*
"Yes? Whats that got to do with anything?"
"Nothing. So don't you think you ought to give these folks a break?"
"Yeah, I'll give em a break alright!"
*Leaps up with axe. Wood Elf Stage crew struggle to pull him off of Zarchoomi. Crowd goes wild!*
"Duh..."
"Well, we'll be right back after these messages, when I'll be talking to a Tier'Dal Ambassador whos says he'd really be a nice guy if people would only stop trying to kill him for his dagger. Don't go away now!"
cheesy music*
*applause*
"Hi, you back live, with the Ziffy Springer No-Text Show. Today is 'People only want me for my Rare Drops' and I'd like you all to meet my next guests, all the way from Crushbone Keep, Ambassador D'Vinn!"
*Crowd go wild*
"Hi there Ziffy"
"Good to have you on the show, I know you're a very busy man. So you say that people camp outside just to get a shot at killing you, when really you just want them to stop in and have a chat, is that it?"
"Yes, Ziffy, I'm a Tier'Dal with needs too! I'm an Ambassador, and I travel alot, I'm often away from home for...long periodssss...of time"
*D'Vinn wells up, crowd go ahh*
"Is okay, D'Vinn, take your time. Do you know why they keep attacking you?"
*D'Vinn covers his eyes and nods*
"It's the dagger isn't it? Can we see the dagger?"
*D'Vinn nods and pulls out exhibit A. Many Elves in the front row start to look edgy*
"Can we get a close up on that? Ok. That is a beautiful dagger."
*snuffle*
*cheesey music*
*applause*
"Hi, wlecome back to Ziffy Springer's No-Text show, with today's topic 'People only want me for my Rare Drops'. No earlier we heard the sad, sad tales of the Nybright Sisters from Lesser Fay, Faydwer, well now I'd like you to meet two very nice Ogres from the Butcherblock Mountians, give a hand, for Cornflunk and Zarchoomi!"
*more applause, mixed with jeers*
*Two Ogres stomp on to stage*
"So hi there guys, thats it, take a seat. Oh. Can we have some more seats here? Ok. So, you say that everybody wants to take off your heads, is that it?"
"Duh..."
"Thats okay, take your time."
"Him fik in da hed, him not no. Yub. We grew up in da Feerrott an make da big mojo. But we is alwayse getting barshed gud by dem lizzies an even da bouncers barsh too!"
"Ah, police brutallity, go on, go on..."
"So me sez to him, why don we emmiig...emarg...move to sumwere were dey not barsh? He jus sit dere and go 'Duh'"
"Duh..."
"So me jus grab him and we make da big swim, to Faydwer, da land of oppor..oppa...less barshing. We find da nice little spot an set up, an start making da mojo again. But befor long we is vizited by dem Dwarfies. Dey is all shouting and saying 'Youze go home, wez not wan you here!'

"It...It was my mothers..."
"Well, maybe if you perhaps just gave it to people instead of trying to stab them with it..."
*Ziffys next words are lost as the Elves in the front row surge onto the stage. Panic, Pandemonium and madness ensue. Eventually, the Troll Stage Security 'barsh' order in to everyone*
"Okay, I can see we have a very delicate topic here. I'm going to take a few questions from the audience...you, yes the Gnome with the yellow tee-shirt on, thats it, stand up, what? Oh, okay, well stand on the chair then. Okay."
"Uh, Hi Ziffy...Um, I'd like to ask the Dark Elf guy there...What the hell are you doing with all those Orcs, man, I mean thats some sick shit!"
*crowd go wild D'Vinn looks angry*
"The Orcs are my friends, okay, and if you can't deal with that, then you can just *beep* off, lawn-ornament!"
"Yeah, come on Mr Orclover! I'll take you!"
*Ziffy intervenes*
"Okay, okay, we're all friends here. You, the Barbarian two rows back, with the kilt, no, not you, or you, yes you!"
"Hi Ziffie! I vant to know, vot is so special wiv dee dagger anyway? I use this!"
*Barbaian pulls out flaming sword, crowd panic and run everywhere, Troll security wrestle the Barbarian to the floor and disarm him, order is gradually restored*
"Phew, okay folks, time to take a break now, but don't go anywhere, because my last guest is someone very special indeed. See you soon!"
*applause*
"Okay, your back with Ziffy Springer's No-Text Show, today: 'People only want me for my Rare Drops'. We've seen a lot of interesting people on the show today so far, but my last guest is some-one very special indeed.
She's proabably most famous for her fashion sense, globally acknowledged as a major trend setter. She's also an evil mage with death on her mind, all the way from the Lavastorm Mountains, yes, it's Najena!"
*crowd goes apet as a haughty looking woman wearing THAT dress strides on to the stage and elegantly sits down*
"Okay, okay, so hello Najena, welcome to the show."
"Hello there, dahh-ling."
"So your an evil mage, thats good, the world needs more of them, and you say that in the past year alone, you've had more dresses stolen from you than there are people in Antonica, yes?" "Yes, Ziffy, and I'm not sure I can take any more. I mean vistors to Lavastorm are rare enough, the area isn't exactly an idylic picnic spot, and when they do come to visit, they don't even bother throwing me a witty riposte anymore. I mean as an evil mage, you come to depend on a good flow of banter with your prey, "Ah, ha! I have you now!", "You will not leave this place alive!", that sort of thing, but nowadays they almost seem bored and just get straight to it and steal the dress."
"Can we get a close up on the dress? Ok. Come on Najena, give us a twirl."
*Najena blushes*
"Go on, let's see it"
*Najena stands and does a quick spin. The robe flows out and all the magic users in the crowd get a bit edgy*
"Beautiful. So why is it you think people want that dress so badly?"
"Well Ziffy, I can't help it if I dress better than these tramps, can I?"
*Najena guestures at the Nybright Sisters, glowering in the row behind. Cat-fight errupts. Crowd cheers*
"Zif-fy, Zif-fy, Zif-fy"
*Wood Elf stage crew and Troll security spilt them up*
"Alright, let's settle down. So Najena, do you not think there might be a case that you are, perhaps, and don't get me wrong here, I'm just playing devils advocate here, that you are asking for it? I mean Lavastorm is a pretty rough neighbourhood, and there you are flowing along in that...?"
"Hey, I'm not about to be told by some bunch of hobos how I can and can't look!"
*Women in the crowd shout out in support*
"You go girl!"
"Okay, well I'm going to field a few question for Najena here...you there, yes, the Erudite with the big forehead."
"Huh yeah, hi Ziffy, I'd just like to tell Najena...You can take that dress off for me any day baby!"
"Oh yeah, in your dreams, punk"
*Najena gives the Erudite the finger*
"Okay, okay...you ma'am, yes the halfling lady there"
"Yes Ziffy, I'd like to ask Najena, Why doesn't she just find a nice guy, settle down and stop dressing like such a vamp, maybe then she won't have these problems."
"Good point, Najena?"
"Well, I'm a career girl and this IS the ninties, and I don't see why I should just take that shit! Anyway honey, why don't YOU try a little make-up once in a while, because you sure as hell need it!"
*Crowd roars, Ziffy is forced to stop the halfling from charging the stage*
"Okay, so Najena, did you know that your dress goes for about two hundred platinum pieces on the open market? That could be part of the problem you know."
*Across the crowd, various magical chants are started*
"Oh, yeah? Come on then, I'll take you all!"
*Najena's eyes flash red, she stands and starts chanting*
*Camera goes white, then static*
[We appear to be experieincing some technical difficulties at the moment, but will be back with the Ziffy Springer No-Text Show very soon]
*applause*
"Okay, your back with Ziffy Springer's No-Text Show, and as you can see, we've got the fires under control now. We apologise for the technical hitch there."
*Camera pans around to show a fire blackened stage and a charred, and somewhat subdued audience. Najena looks somewhat smug*
*Cut to Ziffy, perched on a stool, "Ziffy's Final Thought" written on the wall behind him*
"We've certainly seen a lot of different lifestyles here tonight, but they all have one thing in common; people only seem to see them for their rare and valuable items. Perhaps having these items comforts them in some way, or perhaps, and more likely, this wealth brings a price of its own. They say money can't buy you happiness, well maybe they're right. Deep down, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you are a Mad God of Pain, possesing dozens, or just a lowly Orc Pawn, we all need someone to care about us, someone to see us for who we really are. So next time you're out and about, camping a creature with a rare drop, why not just stop a minute, say hello maybe swear at them a bit, because remember, thats not just a Mob or an NPC with a Rare drop, thats a person too.
"Take care of yourselves, and each other.
"Good night!"
*roll end credits, music, etc*
"Hi Ziffy, we came all the way from Qeynos to see the show, you're the best!"
"Hey, Ziffy, killer show!"
"Me like da barshing Ziffy! It wuz gud!"
"Hallo Ziffie! Do you think I could have my sword back now?"
*etc*
*etc*
