Straight from the Developer's Corner is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000191.html"><b>Stacking Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I realise this may have been intentional as part of the patch but I just wanted to express my concern as part of the SK community. Before the last patch Speed of Shissar, from the Enchanter Epic, simply overwrote spells such as Shadow Vortex and Shroud of Pain. Shadow Vortex and Shroud of Pain are minor AC drains which are very commonly used on raids and in normal grouping situations to manage aggro. This is especially true when preparing to break Mez on a mob. <br><br>Since the latest patch Speed of Shissar will not land on me if I've used Shroud of Pain or Shadow Vortex or Shroud of Hate. Unless, of course, Speed of Shissar is cast upon me beforehand, then I can use Shadow Vortex, etc, until Shissar wears off at which point Shissar either has to be refreshed while the icon is flashing or I have to wait until these self-only drain spells wear off, they cannot be clicked off. <br><br>The previous effect of these spells being overwritten was easily acceptable. The AC benefit is not so much a concern really as 15 points or so of AC isn't that big a deal. The problem is that these spells cannot be used appropriately to manage aggro anymore. If I'm on a raid now I either have to get the enchanter to use an actual haste spell (other than the Augment line) costing them mana and not extending me the benefit of the added features of Shissar such as Agi bonus or endurance regeneration boost, or I have to totally forgo a very strong role that I play on raids in order to be able to have Speed of Shissar. <br><br>These spells don't afford a great personal benefit in the stats they provide. In fact most would argue that the benefit they provide in stats is quite inconsequential. The stats they provide have nothing to do with why we use them. We use them to push ourselves up on hate lists to keep mobs on us instead of our caster friends. Without the ability to do that, we lose out on a major role that we've lived with for quite some time. <br><br>Please review this stacking issue. This has taken away part of a shadow knight's usefullness on raids and for what? There is no logical reason these spells shouldn't stack, or at least have Shissar overwrite shadow vortex as it used to. I had an enchanter try to land Shissar on me 5 times last night before we figured out what was going on then had to switch to a significantly lower damage weapon combo to prevent having to ask for zing every 10 minutes all becouse I had to have a less beneficial version of haste cast on me due to these changes. <br><br>As a member of a class that has no role against true uber mobs, at all, I find it very unnerving to have one of our major roles against non-uber mobs striped out from under us. So please, shed some light on this issue and let the SK community know what you plan to do about it, if anything... <br><br>Vendric Ravenkrest<br>- 55 Tier'Dal Revenant of Hate ]</i></font><br><br>------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>The problem is how Speed of the Shissar is built in our spell database. This is the same problem that Call of Earth has. I'd like to be able to tell you "I'll move some stuff around and throw it up on test to see if it works" unfortunately I can't fix it right now. I've looked over the problems with speed of the Shissar a few dozen times. All I can really tell you is that a number of stacking complications we currently have should be rectified in the coming Months. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>------------------------------------------<br><br>:)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000188.html"><b>Epic Spell Message Not Epic Enough</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello! I'm writing to ask a question about the Wizard Epic Quest spell message. The effect on the Wizard Epic is Barrier of Force, a self only rune + mana regen -- very nice effect. The issue I have is with the message the spell gives when it is cast. <br><br>Manaskin, level 54 Spell. When cast it gives the following message: <br><br>Soandso's skin gleams with an incandescent glow. <br><br>Barrier of Force, Wizard Epic effect. When cast it gives the following message: <br><br>Soandso's skin gleams with an incandescent glow. <br><br>Notice the simularity? This is a minor request, one that could most likely be done in a matter of minutes. Can we get this message changed? Perhaps something like, <br><br>Soandso is surrounded by a Barrier of Force. <br><br>Again, it's a minor complaint but those of us who have our epic have worked hard and it's something I know a lot of us would like to see changed. :)<br><br>PS: The level 54 spell, Voltiac Draught is spelled wrong when scribed in your spell book. It should be spelled 'Voltiac Draught' instead it is spelled 'Voltiac Draugh'. Another minor change. :)  Thanks again! <br><br>Rombus Mindspire<br>60 Sorcerer of Triton, Povar Server. ]</i></font><br><br>------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>You know...you're absolutely right! Thanks for pointing this out, I'll see if I can come up with something a little more ummm epic :)<br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>------------------------------------------<br><br>And, in fact, he already has changed it. You should see a new message next patch. I'll also see what we can do about that Voltaic Draught thing&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Agnostic Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi Absor, <br><br>I just wanted to point the fact that even if the idea of deity related quests is nice and all, I personnally like it, I find it unfair for those that are actually agnostics. Why no quest for them? I understand from a point of roleplay, but it wouldn't be first time something is made and justified later just for the sake of balance. <br><br>The fact people choose agnostic for the advantages they get from it is not a good reason to not make them have items that are Agnostic only. I personnaly made my rogue long ago, 2 years ago actually, and when I choose to be agnostic, I didn't do it to get any advantage but because no god available to me were what I was looking for. Maybe some people take the path to Agnostic for advantage, but it is same with those taking gods sometimes, especially with the imbued armors now... Maybe more agnostics are that way because of advantages it brings, but I wouldn't bet on it. But it's not a reason to 'throw' us out of the quest train just for that reason. Some of us made that choice for non-advantage reasons. And what about monks human? Be a monk of quelious or else you are nothing? Honnestly, I don't think it's a good idea to not give us Agnostic specific quests. <br><br>Thanks for reading it, and please just don't forget us... <br><br>Samanea Nightwish<br>Rogue Barbarian 58<br>Agnostic<br>Solusek Ro server ]</i></font><br><br>Well, here's the thing. <br><br>The following is written without concern for roleplaying choices. Such choices should and will be made with consideration for consequences and benefits, but without concern for choosing the 'best' options. All I'm talking about are 'balance' things here. <br><br>Without any deity specific items or quests, the 'advantage' goes to the agnostic because they have a more neutral faction. There are no advantages to choosing a deity, only disadvantages (with the exception of the classes that require you to choose a deity to play the class). <br><br>For game balance, we had no intention of making agnostic the preferable choice when choosing a religion. I would even be bold enough to suggest that in the world of Norrath it would seem more appropriate for the majority of the population to worship deities. So it makes sense that there be some encouragement for people to choose to worship a deity rather than not. <br><br>In fact, the way I see an agnostic in Norrath, someone that chooses not to worship the gods would have a harder life than others. Why would a cleric want to bless someone that has purposefully chosen to thwart the gods by not worshipping them? Playing an agnostic would be something that I see as a brave non-conformist choice with a lot of risk with a reward that might only be personal satisfaction. <br><br>Of course, I love playing agnostic in such a situation. :)<br><br>So it's not a matter of being forgotten, it's more a matter of this is what we want to do. We'll keep the agnostic in mind, for certain, but the advantages to those of a religious nature are intentional.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000192.html"><b>Imbued Idols </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: While extremely overjoyed with the inclusion of Imbued Idols in the recent patch, I was disheartened to learn that they have no class listed in the class useable section.

I think all those quests would be awesome... It would take away from the Hack and Slash... Haven't played in 3 weeks, cause I started to get tired of that.

In this game there were several cursed items that once you picked them up they became equipped. You had to do some sort of a quest to have it removed. <br><br>It would be neat to see some items in EQ like that. Perhaps they have a good benefit too...say for example a ring that acts like a key to somewhere but changes the natural healing of your character so that you lose a hit point every tic until you do a quest to have it removed. <br><br>Some other ideas are a mask that changes your image to that of another race and you have to do a quest to have it removed. Or a belt that gives you a the ability to port out of a sticky situation (can only be used once) but the price to use it is a huge faction drop, until you complete a quest. <br><br>You could even make some ultra rare so that people would search them out just for the glory. <br><br>McCade ]</i></font><br><br>The sad (and funny) thing is that there are already some 'cursed' items in the game. Mostly high level sort of things, but they can be dropped. What happens with those items? People send me e-mail asking if they are broken and when are we going to fix them&#8230; <br><br>:)<br><br>I'm not too sure how well a cursed item that you can't drop would go over. There might be a large number of players out there that would be upset by such an item or curse. I'm not sure.

As it is now a melee character can make him or herself nearly immune to all enchanter spells with high resists (and high resists are probably much easier to get than they really should be). <br><br>If I were to take a poll on this change, I promise you I would get a yes from every caster and a no from every melee (as a rough generalization). I suspect I could simply count the number of each type of character on the server over level 40 or so and that would fairly approximate the results of a poll on the matter. <br><br>We've examined the numbers and looked at it carefully, and for now we're sticking with this change. It may indeed turn out to be too much of a change. It also may turn out to be too little of a change (as most enchanters would probably tell you). <br><br>Let's try this out. We're certainly not going to change this at all for a while, at least until we've all played with it some.</UL>

An addendum to the latest patch was added to the Patch Server yesterday:<UL>May 31st, 2:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*** Patch Addendum ***<br><br>This evening we put in another patch to correct some issues that arose with the patch yesterday.  The changes implemented include some that weren't announced previously:<br><br>- Resist-debuffs will do 1.5 times their normal value for PvP encounters.  In other words, if the spell did -60MR in PvP before, it does -90MR in PvP now.  PvE (combat versus NPCs) remains unaffected.<br>- Faction-loss for PvP kills on Vallon and Tallon now only occur against factions within the hometown of the person killed.  In other words, if you kill an Erudite in Erudin, you will only lose faction with the factions in Erudin, not the factions in Paineel.<br>- Turning in the Tomb of Order and Discord will have no effect on Vallon and Tallon.<br>- On all PvP servers, only the person who gets the killing-blow in PvP combat will have looting rights.  We would prefer to implement some sort of "majority damage" logic however this should solve most of the issues associated with uninvolved players "ninja-looting" the loser in PvP encounters.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Computer Games Online kicked up a <a href="http://www.cgonline.com/previews/everquest-01c-p1.html">new preview of the Shadows</a> of Luclin today.  The article goes over the basic information we already know, and only includes a few screenshots of the new Gnome models.  Here's a clip:  <UL>Unlike Scars of Velious, which was aimed at higher-level characters and often required larger scale raids (the final boss took 40 characters to kill), Luclin is designed for small parties and characters of all levels. Although producer Jeff Butler admits this will be the first feature to go if the team is pressed for time, they hope to add animals that can be ridden like horses into the game. Many of Luclin's improvements only apply to its 25 new zones. "We may improve the old world in the future," he says, "but we're not sure whether that's going to happen".</UL>The Shadows of Luclin is EverQuest's third expansion pack.

The <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/main/indev.jsp">In Development</a> section of EverQuest.com was updated yesterday:<UL><b>05/30/2001</b><br>With E3 out of the way and summer starting up here are the things we are currently working on that you can expect to see over the next few months:<br><UL><P><br><li><b>Loot rules in the Warrens:</b> We plan to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be eliminating several ways around the current "Trivial Combat Code" as well as looking at the problem of "spell twinking" in regards to the loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.<br><br><li><b>Stonebrunt Mountains:</b> The next "free" zone will be the Stonebrunt Mountains, which will be located off the Warrens. It will support a level range roughly equivalent to that in Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the zone sometime this summer.<br><br><li><b>Dungeon Touchups/Revamps:</b> We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons in the world. Our last patch included an updated Runnyeye complete with new monsters and treasures to be plundered. Next on the list is Permafrost Keep. Lady Vox has been in the mood to do some redecorating of her lair, which includes replacing some of her more lackwitted minions. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.<br><br><li><b>Big Changes Planned for PvP:</b> We've had a number of meetings lately to plan changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually be going up are still to be announced.<br><br><li><b>3D Engine Enhancements:</b> One of the first things up is the enhancement of the engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the "moving stair step" visual artifact that you see in distant places where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance will be greatly improved.<br><br><li><b>Deity Specific Quests:</b> We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in the works.<br><br><li><b>The History Unfolds:</b> Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history and the future of the world will be made known.<br><br><li><b>Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants:</b> We're going to continue adding more quests and flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races' territories.<br><br><li><b>New NPC Return Policy:</b> Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a mob and gotten the "Thank You!" message? We are currently working on a way for mobs to return any non-quest items back to the player who accidentally gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.<br><br><li><b>Class Balance Discussions:</b> Some recent changes have been introduced as a result of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback as we see fit.<br><br><li><b>But That Doesn't Make Sense!:</b> We on the EverQuest Team realize that with all the factions, plots, and quests in Norrath we end up with a few oversights that just don't make sense in the overall story of the world. And so, for the sake of being true to our world, we've decided to keep an eye out specifically for these things and make changes where necessary. The fact that you now have the option to quest for your Ghoulbane from a froglok paladin rather than just brutally murdering the poor chap is just one example of these changes with many more to come.<br><br><li><b>Guildwars:</b> We've noticed a huge lack in player participation of this feature due to a lot of bugs with it. Our hope is that by fixing these bugs and enhancing the system a bit more people might be interested in going to war with their local guilds. </UL><P><br><br>Stay tuned for more new info on what we are planning for this summer. Until then, happy hunting!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Honestly I didn't feel the spell was needed.

Too much effect and it's too powerful, too little and it's not good enough. There's far less room for error when balancing such a spell.

The existing Large Sewing Kits were changed to Deluxe Sewing Kits. If it was just a name change this would be fine but they gained 1.0 weight.

Existing sewing kits were changed. <br><br>Ostil ]</i></font><br><br>This was my mistake. I wrote that little bit of misinformation, and I'm sorry. <br><br>The intent of the change was to keep the ten slot kits so that people wouldn't lose things, but to make them less desirable for carrying things. The cleanest way to do that was to rename the old kits to deluxe (and increase their weight) and to make new large kits for sale on vendors. So the 10 slot ones can't be purchased anymore, and the 'large' kit is reduced to 8 slots. <br><br>It's the best way to do what we wanted to do. I just misunderstood what was going on when it was explained to me. I'm sorry about the error.

But when the lvl 50+ people are calling camps for mobs that are 30 levels lower than them and prohibiting people that would actually get experience from hunting I believe that is wrong. ]</i></font><br><br>We were aware that there would be a stampede to the zone once we announced it in the patch message, and some thought had been given to implementing the ABF (Anti-Bottom Feeding) code there, but we decided against it. <br><br>We had promised that we would not be doing this to existing zones, and despite the fact that 99.9% of the population of Runnyeye is new, most of the old items from the zone were retained, (alongside the new items to be found there) to allow existing quests dependant on them to remain functional. <br><br>Turning on the ABF code there could have had detrimental effects on those trying to complete quests. <br><br>I feel that after the "shiny" wears off, the over-level players will leave the zone, and those of the appropriate level can begin to really enjoy the zone. <br><br>- Kendrick <br><br>Thanks for the questions Kaysha and Thump. And thanks for the answers Kendrick. :)<br><br>I also wanted to toss this next comment out because it was so nice. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Great Job. I love the new touches even though im lv 52 and really too high to hunt there the. "Mood messages" are a really nice touch as well as the balance of the place is very much improved from the old days where you could run into anything from lv 8 to lv 34 there. <br><br>I love the story too. I know the old runnyeye and how the goblins had allied with king xorbb who reigns in beholder maze. It looks like the runnyeye goblins allied with the pickclaws and turned on old king xorbb. <br><br>Very nice touch.

Some folks are upset that we announced the change to Runnyeye, blaming the influx of high level characters into the zone on the fact that we mentioned it in the patch message. <br><br>Even if we had not announced the change, players would know about it. The flood of characters into the zone would have been the same, announced or not. The only difference, I suspect, is that now the flood of curious high level characters will happen all at once and then, hopefully, trail off to something like normal. <br><br>There is no preventing this effect. It happened in The Warrens, even with the ABF (which sounds a lot like some battle-hardened plastic product). <br><br>In any case, I've had the chance to peer at the zone as Kendrick was working on it. I love the dialogues and the feel of the place now (which I, like many others, only used as a path to other places before).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000182.html"><b>Mcicontrol </b></a><br>Keileual wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I noticed in the new update that theres a command listed as /mcicontrol its also in the ingame /help normal.

Then to get the FFC you'd have to be a master tailor yourself, and you'd only ever make one, since you couldn't sell it. <br>Alan" <br><br>Simple solution: Quest! This is Everquest after all. In order to make the FBSS into the FFC you would need some non-nodrop item such made by a tradesperson then turn in the item to a quest NPC who does the actual tailoring of the FBSS to the FFC. Being that this would be such an intricate undertaking, no normal tailor would possible be able to perform such a feat anyway. Only someone who spent their time tailoring and nothing else, like hunting mobs and such that PCs do, could possibly have the skill to pull this off... NPC Tailors don't do much of anything BUT Tailor so it would make sense that they are REALLY good at it, moreso than your typical player who spends more time hunting to gather materials, gain xp, etc etc... <br><br>A very highly skilled player tailor could possess the skills to create one of the items needed to make the FFC though. <br><br>For example:<br>Eliandra Silkspinner tells you she can make a Fine Silk Fedora if she only had all the proper materials. She needs a Flowing Black Silk Sash for the hatband, 2 swatches of Purple Velvet for the hat itself, and a rare fedora pattern. <br><br>The swatches of Purple Velvet could involve multiple tradeskills if you so chose. Perhaps a Highly skilled tailor to make the Velvet swatches by combining 2 velvet pieces dropped off certain young unicorns with new horns with platinum threads. The velvet swatches would then need to be dyed using dye made by an alchemist/poison maker like the armor dyes. Then you'd have to obtain the rare fedora pattern by killing some other NPC, or perhaps that could be another quest in an of itself as well... In the end though, when you finally manage to gather up the 2 purple velvet swatches and the rare fedora pattern, you would turn them in along with your FBSS to the quest NPC who would tailor you a pimpin Purple Velvet Fedora which has the haste from the FBSS plus some other stats and is nodrop since it's quested! <br><br>Sure it'd be tough, but who wouldn't make the effort for a Purple Velvet Fedora?!?! Especially if you were to make an appropriate graphic for it hehe :)]</i></font><br><br>Ok, that makes sense. Not a bad idea. <br><br>And I think three other folks suggested the same thing. Thanks to all of you. I love the way these ideas come together. :)</UL>

For example, I play a level 30 ranger on the Druzzil Ro server, who worships Tunare...So obviousally, I never got into groups to hunt Treants, but I didn't take it upon myself to hang out near them and harass players that decided to hunt them. I think this is a example of how to intergrate roleplay into a system that dosn't require it. <br><br>It's all about attitude. For instance, my ranger is going to raise a few eyebrows at the dark elf shadowknight that comes up to him and quotes: <br><br>"Sow, plz!" <br><br>This is where my chracter might /glare and tell the dark elf that he has no clue what he wants, and to please take his presense elsewhere...Ironically, one of my characters closest friends and groupmates is a Dark Elf Shadowknight, and my ranger has no problem fighting for this Shadowknight, and doing most anything for him. OOCly, it's becuase the player behind said shadowknight is a friend. In Character, my ranger trusts this character, and beleives him to be exception to the "Evil" shadowknight... <br><br>I think the trick to roleplaying on a non PVP server is to realize that it's not always possible. I myself made a few rules for it that made everything really simple. <br><br>/say and /emote and /shout are in character things. My characters will not /say "I'm a level xxx of this class" or "Give me sow and i'll start pulling yellows and we'll rake in some nice exp" <br><br>/group, /guild, /tell, /ooc, /auction -- there are all out of chracter things, I don't really roleplay in these forms unless someone else is and it's the logical reason to roleplay back, for instance, if a friend sends me a tell that is obviosally in chararacter, i'm going to respond in the same way. <br><br>It's all about balence, and knowing when roleplay is called for, and when you can't do it. Basically, try as hard as you can to make your chraracter have a personality, and roleplay should come quite naturally. ]</i></font><br><br>You've pretty much nailed it. When playing tabletop roleplaying games I'm usually very careful to keep my in character comments in character. But that doesn't mean that I don't throw things at people or comment on someone's particularly bad B.O. out of character. Though when sitting around the table we can more easily rely on visual clues to in and out of character conversations. <br><br>In the end, roleplaying isn't a chore. And a character with a personality is very easy to play. <br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi Alan, <br><br>I've been reading the above-titled discussion with great interest. I've always had an affinity for roleplaying, and despite the fact that I don't roleplay much myself, I'm very receptive to those who do, and quickly jump into it when confronted with somebody who is roleplaying. I've also noticed that it appears to be the roleplayers who are most likely to be "chosen" for active participation in the "big events" that are part of the historical quests. (One example: Banegrivm on Druzzil Ro was "chosen" to lead the Light armies in battle against Lanys T'Vyl and the Tier'Dal in Bloody Kithicor.) <br><br>This ties in very closely with another topic earlier regarding "What is the Story of EverQuest" or something along those lines, where people were proposing such things as the Qeynos Guard burning down Fish's Ale and such. <br><br>I think you missed the point of the person who took issue with your statement, "Pacifists don't make good adventurers." <br><br>What he was trying to say, I think, and I don't know if I can be any more clear about it, is that "adventuring" does not mean killing or helping people kill. There are many, many things that can happen in a roleplaying game that can be considered "adventuring" that don't involve killing at all. Riddles, goal-oriented quests, information gathering, etcetera. <br><br>I definitely agree that a pacifist doesn't make a good adventurer *if* you define "adventuring" as "go kill this beast and bring me its head" and so on. However, I think that is a very narrow definition of "adventuring". <br><br>An example: there is a small quest for Wizards in Qeynos, in which the quester must bring a note to a wizard NPC (I've forgotten his name) who tends to loiter around the guard tower in Qeynos Hills. The reward for this quest is a spell and some experience. Now this might not seem like much of a quest, and it's not, but making that trip from Qeynos to that tower at first or second level does have some element of risk to it, yet does not require the slaying of any NPC. In my book, this is still "adventuring". <br><br>So I think a more appropriate statement would be that "pacifists don't make good killers". And, well, that's a no-brainer. <br><br>Cheers<br>Darkas Dusk<br>Tier'Dal Warrior <br><br>(agnostic, and very difficult to roleplay!) ]</i></font><br><br>That's reasonable enough. Pacifists make poor killers. :)<br><br>And, in essence, you are correct. We have defined 'adventurer' in the more aggressive sense for the most part. But you can most certainly adventure in EverQuest as a pacifist, as long as you are adventuring as such. So you can see the world, a lot of it anyway. You can talk to the people. You can do several quests. All that is adventuring. <br><br>But EverQuest was designed around the concept of an adventurer in the sense of Conan, or even Robin Hood. A design choice that I think was a good one. And, yes, in that world an 'adventurer' that is a pacifist won't be as good of an adventurer as the brutal warrior.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing for XP, Not Loot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br>--------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Regardless, you can travel and see the world without having a quest. I know a lot of folks that simply make up their own reasons to visit >other places (such as their High Elf wanting to see the library at Erudin). Developing your >character is not entirely our responsibility, most of that falls onto the player. <br>--------------------------------<br><br>My first comment may be more suited to the role playing thread, but it's in response to something here, so that's that. Once, when my ranger was but a young, level 6 or 7 lad, he went mad. He babbled about "steam" and how steam would change all of Norrath, and vowed to go visit the gnomes to learn about steam. So, at a young level, I found a good role play reason to journey all the way to Ak'Anon for the first time, RPing the whole merry way. (This was before the steam ship to Velious, too) <br><br>That leads me to a possible questing idea for you to toss to the quest makers. Some have complained that more quests must be made that offer greater experience rewards, or that involve your character more. How about "curse quests," or whatever you'd like to all them? <br><br>Simply put, they would work by putting a burden and/or penalty on a character for the time the quest is active, only being removed until the quest is finished. Because of the downside for players - they could be stuck with the penalty for a while if they don't get right to questing - the exp rewards for these quests could be bumped up while still remaining fair. Of course, some way to ensure players know they are about to undertake a quest of this type must be in place. Easy enough. Make the bracketed text, or the quest text, in red (or some other BOLD color). Here are some simple ideas that can be easily modified to fit a variety of quests: <br><br>Cindy Perlam of Qeynos has a problem. Her infant son is terribly sick and needs medical attention, and only the kind a high elf doctor can give. She wants you to take her son to Felwithe for treatment. The problem is, the lad takes up a full inventory slot and leaves a character with a permanent encumbered and/or snared effect until the trip to Felwithe and back is done. If there is a way to have the infant NO RENT to ports (a little boy can't survive a port, can he?) all the better. <br><br>Sir Lenderslat in Freeport has had some nasty rumors about him passed around, and because you were set up at the local tavern (maybe prompted by another quest), he thinks you did it! You have to clear your name, and his, by shuffling a series of notes and keywords around Freeport. The problem is, you have gone completely KOS to every guard in the city. You must clear your own name by restoring Sir Lenderslat's good name, at which time the 10,000 point faction hit you took will be counteracted by another 10,000 point hit in the opposite direction. <br><br>Lugga the Ogre just doesn't like being fat anymore ... so if she has to be fat, you all have to be! When you agree to help her get the diet food she needs to slim down, she fattens you up first to punish you in case you failed. Your AGI and CHA plummet, and worse yet, you begin eating at three times the normal rate. The effects remain until you can get Lugga the low fat grub she needs, which must be gathered from several locations and cooked up for her by a master baker. <br><br>What about a quest that ruins a character's ability to speak common, leaving only, say, halfing as a means to communicate? Or one that has every banker in Norrath thinking you're a bank robber and refusing to serve you but one, the one in Runnyeye, who is also the only one who can clear your name? Or a troll who thinks you're so ugly, he casts a semi-permanent invis on you until you can finish his quest? <br><br>And so on. Will players take on quests that stick them with penalties if it means better role playing or more exp in the end? I don't know. But if possible to incorporate quests like these, I think they would make questing more interesting, dynamic and fun. Just an idea, <br><br>Talmer [Winter Raven]<br>Ranger, Bristlebane ]</i></font><br><br>I love some of your ideas. I'm not sure how many people would be entertained by the idea of having an Ogre stuff muffins down you until she's comfortable in your presence&#8230; but I would! <br><br>Thanks for the amusing ideas. I'll make sure the team sees them.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>Economy Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan, you wrote "So a few months after allowing people to destroy their FBSS to create, I dunno, Felt Fedora's of Coolness, then the FFoC would replace the FBSS on the list of items that are too common for the sake of the economy." <br><br>What if the FFC were NO DROP? That would effectively remove the FBSS from the economy without introducing a new problem. This is effectively what you are doing with some of the Epic Quest items. <br><br>Sheesh]</i></font> <br><br>But it would be created by a trade skill, so making it No-Drop wouldn't be too cool. Then to get the FFC you'd have to be a master tailor yourself, and you'd only ever make one, since you couldn't sell it.</UL>

Casting sow isn't the only thing that they do well.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Rangers of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

The latest patch message is up:<UL>May 30th, 1:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*** Fan Faire ***<br><br><br>The new EverQuest expansion, Shadows of Luclin, will be displayed <br>and demonstrated at the Minneapolis Fan Faire! Don't miss this chance <br>to see the latest and greatest upcoming features in the world of <br>Norrath!<br><br>Registration for the event closes on June 4! Hurry and reserve your spot! <br>Visit <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/">http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/</a> to register or for <br>more information!<br><br><br><br>*** Message about our Guide Program ***<br><br><br>Hail citizens of Norrath!<br><br>Hear my words, for I bring news of great importance.<br><br>Today I present to you an adventure, perhaps the greatest the Lands <br>of Norrath have ever offered.  It is a quest of great proportions, and <br>a journey fraught with danger.  Fear not though my friends, for the <br>spiritual rewards of this journey far outweigh any hardship involved.<br><br>As of now, we are once again gathering an adventuring party to protect <br>and serve the lands of Norrath.  Scribes are lining up even now so that <br>they may take your application to become a Guide of Norrath.<br><br>We are seeking those strong in character, bright in wit, soft with <br>compassion, and filled with joy.<br><br>If you've ever felt good helping a fellow adventurer retrieve his corpse, <br>or with helping someone when they felt all was lost, then this is truly <br>the adventure for you.  Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could <br>bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens.  Maybe your renowned <br>acting skills might be of help.  If you are kind, compassionate, and <br>helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.<br><br>If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be <br>difficult at times.  You can be assured that you will be tried...  <br>and hopefully you will be found true.  In the end though, the citizens <br>of Norrath will benefit from your thoughtful participation, and the <br>lands of Norrath will continue to become a better place.<br><br>If you feel this is something you must be a part of, then I invite <br>you to point your browser to: <a href="http://guideapp.everquest.com">http://guideapp.everquest.com</a><br><br>We ask so little of your time, but the benefits you can bring to <br>Norrath are grand.<br><br>A few things to remember:<br>1) You must have an active EverQuest account in good standing.<br>2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<br>3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<br>4) You will need good communication skills.<br>5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<br>6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.<br><br><br>Come one, come all... help us to make the lands of Norrath better <br>than they already are... come be a part of the EverQuest Guide <br>Program!<br><br> - The EverQuest Guide Program<br><br><br><br>*** Important Reminder ***<br><br>Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small <br>chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch.  GMs will <br>have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.  That means that <br>they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one.  It is also <br>important to understand that attempting to scam a GM about a lost <br>corpse could mean banning from EverQuest.<br><br>** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM <br>ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **<br><br>We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time.  <br>In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a <br>problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were <br>unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in and check on it <br>right away after the patch.<br><br>So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned <br>up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of <br>corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of <br>them disappearing.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br><br>*** Patch Message ***<br><br><br>** Zone Changes **<br><br>- Runnyeye has been changed.  Something is up in Goblin land...<br><br><br>** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **<br><br>- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code.  For the most <br>part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to <br>stack that were never intended to stack.<br><br>- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.<br><br>- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of <br>Cazic Thule can scribe it.<br><br>- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been <br>changed to be more appropriate.<br><br><br><br>** Features and Interface Changes **<br><br>- The variable %t will now work with /assist.  So you can use /assist %t <br>if you wish.  Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist <br>without the %t.<br><br>- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.<br><br>- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to <br>user color 15 (same as other skill messages).  The success message <br>was already set to user color 15.<br><br>- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does.  <br>It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server.  The new <br>ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list <br>(<character name>_<#>.ini).  The first time a character is created or <br>loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old <br>ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.<br><br>- The Alt key now works in several new situations.  It will now show <br>item names when in the trade window.  Because the trade items of the <br>local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item <br>names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player <br>positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade <br>window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade <br>item names.<br><br>- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.<br><br>- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse <br>items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.<br><br>- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when <br>held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they <br>don't show up otherwise).<br><br>- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any <br>player that is on your /ignore list.  Some players were using this <br>to annoy players that had ignored them.<br><br>- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are <br>on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to <br>annoy people that had ignored them).<br><br>- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the <br>members of your guild in your zone.  You can also specify a guild name, <br>such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".<br><br>- /safelock command added.  /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface <br>(mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash <br>commands) with the password that you supply to the command.  You must use <br>this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the <br>interface.  Passwords are NOT case-sensitive.  So to lock your interface, <br>you would type /safelock password.  You would do the same to unlock it.  <br>REMEMBER:  If you forget what password you typed, you will need to <br>reboot your machine.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now <br>also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<br><br>- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.<br><br>- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of <br>your waist.<br><br>- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop.  <br>They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. <br><br>- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable.  <br>There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so <br>we had to disable that for these items.<br><br>- Sewing Kits:  No existing sewing kits are being changed with this <br>patch.  But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different.  <br>Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots.  Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 <br>slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.<br><br>- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty <br>blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.<br><br><br>**  Other Stuff **<br><br>- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level <br>bard title.  :)<br><br>- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with <br>that of his counterparts in Velious.  This is not the sort of thing <br>that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that <br>nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest.  We're <br>announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>
