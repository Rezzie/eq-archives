A rather large update was posted on the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/main/indev.jsp">In Development</a> section today:<UL>04/12/2001<br><br>We're finally starting to get back on a regular biweekly patch schedule. Here are the things we are currently working on that you can expect to see over the next few months:<br><br>Loot rules in the Warrens:</b> We plan to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be eliminating several ways around the current "Trivial Combat Code" as well as looking at the problem of "spell twinking" in regards to the loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.<br><br><br><b>Stonebrunt Mountains:</b> The next "free" zone will be the Stonebrunt Mountains, which will be located off the Warrens. It will support a level range roughly equivalent to that in Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the zone sometime this summer.<br><br><br><b>Dungeon Touchups/Revamps:</b> We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons in the world. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.<br><br><br><b>Big Changes Planned for PvP:</b> We've had a number of meetings lately to plan changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually be going up are still to be announced.<br><br><br><b>Continued UI Enhancements:</b> A number of things are planned, from allowing people the ability to buy stacks of items at one time, to improving the way things look on the screen.<br><br><br><b>3D Engine Enhancements:</b> One of the first things up is the enhancement of the engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the "moving stair step" visual artifact that you see in distant places where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance will be greatly improved. Update: This is actually now implemented however is not yet bug- free. You can take a look at the new capabilities by setting VideoModeBitsPerPixel=32 in your EQClient.ini. Note: If your card doesn't support 32 bits per pixel, you will probably crash. Also, your Deity Specific Quests: We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in the works.<br><br><br><b>The History Unfolds:</b> Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history and the future of the world will be made known.<br><br><br><b>Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants:</b> We're going to continue adding more quests and flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races' territories.<br><br><br><b>New NPC Return Policy:</b> Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a mob and gotten the "Thank You!" message? We are currently working on a way for mobs to return any non quest items back to the player who accidentally gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.<br><br><br><b>Class Balance Discussions:</b> Some recent changes have been introduced as a result of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback as we see fit.<br><br><br><b>Velious Magic Resistance:</b> In an effort to further balance the SoV expansion, we're taking another look at the unnaturally high magic resistance of Velious mobs. We'll evaluate this on a zone by zone basis and make changes to better balance out the risk vs. reward in the zones for both melee and caster player characters. <br>We'll fire off more updates as we have information available for release. Until then, enjoy EQ!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

A lot of informative posts were made to the Dev Cornder today by Alan:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000089.html"><b>Inspection</b></a><br>I still have yet to understand why the /inspect on/off was added to the game. This was supposed to keep people from accidently inspecting you when they target you. <br><br>I would of preferred to see the /inspect on/off make it so others cannot inspect me. <br><br>I find it rather annoying having players just run up and inpect me 10-20 times to get my attention or just be an irritant. <br><br>If someone wants to see what I am wearing then they should be polite enough to ask if they may inspect me and at that point I can turn my /inpect on to allow it. <br><br>And yes, when you inspect me... you will see my message about how self concious I am about whether you can see my britches... <br><br>Bolerro<br>18th Season Druid<br>Vazaelle <br><br>Let me go over the philosophy of 'inspection'. The first thing to keep in mind is that nobody is actually inspecting you, at least not in the way that the word would indicate. They are looking at you closely, not turning your clothing inside out to see the labels. <br><br>Inspection does not show your britches. <br><br>What it does show are the things that the game engine doesn't show. If your character is wearing a cloak the only way to know it is to 'inspect' them. The game engine isn't showing what would otherwise be obvious. Inspection only shows the name of an item and it's type (and only that by the icon that shows in inventory). Inspection does not reveal what is in a bag, stats on any item, or what color underwear your character has on. It only shows enough information to allow other players to know what your character would actually look like if the game engine could show every item you are wearing. <br><br>There is nothing invasive about inspecting someone. <br><br>Now if the messages that you receive from the game about someone 'inspecting' you are bothersome, you can turn those off. That would prevent people from using inspection to annoy you. <br><br>I don't disagree with the idea that it is polite to ask someone before you inspect them. But, like many courtesies, it certainly is not necessary. You have the tools you need at your disposal to remove the factor that irritates you about it, should you choose to use them.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000090.html"><b>Bind Sight</b></a><br>Moonshadow wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: About 4 patches ago, "bind sight" was changed in some zones to require line of sight from the caster to the target. There was no announcement of this change, and it considerably reduced the utility of the spell. <br><br>Could we please have an explanation of why this change was made? If it was not intentional, please change the spell back. ]</i></font><br><br>Our 'spell guy', Lawrence Poe, had this to say in response to your question: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This was an unforeseen side effect to a change we made recently. <br><br>The change was made to all spells. Basically we made it so if you are casting a spell be it harmful or beneficial and your target runs out of the spells range, or the casters line of site the spell will not go off and no mana will be used. This was a great enhancement however it had the unforeseen side effect of limiting bind site. There are currently no plans to revert Bind Sight to its former functionality. ]</i></font><br><br>Not much more for me to add. The functionality of the spell has most certainly been reduced. But you can still stay bound to the target for the duration of the spell, even after it leaves your line of site. The check is only made at the time of casting. You just can't use the spell to attach yourself to another NPC from the first to chain yourself out to infinity.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000091.html"><b>Rage of Zomm</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello there, I am a 58 mage on Veeshan and for kicks I decided to try the Rage of Zomm spell for the first time the other day. This pet immediatly suicided once summoned...is this normal? Is this spell being changed or has it been disabled? <br><br>I attempted the summon 4 times and same result as always. I attempted it in Sebilis but I doubt it would be zone restricted. <br><br>Jaytee Bushwacker ]</i></font><br><br>This spell does indeed work. You need to have a target selected and you need to be within normal combat range to that target. The easiest way to get this sort of information is to ask your fellow magicians, as a rule I probably won't be passing on spell casting tips here. I would like to encourage you to talk to players in game to get such information. <br><br>I'm also aware that this spell was mentioned in the class talk threads. I don't have any comment on that aspect of this spell at this time.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000094.html"><b>Frame Rate Drop</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: One of the biggest complain I have from others when I use my AE spell is the Framerate drop it cost on others with slower computer. The Fire Spiral AK is good, although I never get why Fire Spiral would appear as blue wind (blue fire?). But When I toss down the Column of Lighting, or Lightning storm, both have that fire rain effect. Many people in my group starts yelling "Ack, I am so lagged, I can't move around, I can't cast spells." Would it be possible to change these spells so they don't cause many people's computer Frame rate to drop so dramatically? <br><br>Bombus Combus 26th Wiz of Xev ]</i></font><br><br>We wouldn't want to change the spell effects for exactly the reason you noted, they look awesome. But it seems that many people are not aware that you can turn off or reduce those effects if you choose. <br><br>Just click on the 'Options' button (you may have to hit F10 until you're in the 'old' interface mode to do this), then choose 'Display'. There is an option to change you 'Particle Density'. The lower the particle density, the less of a framerate hit you'll take. The trade off is that you'll see fewer of those cool effects.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000095.html"><b>In Development Updated</b></a><br>The 'In Development' portion of the web site is where we keep you updated on things that are in the works. It was updated today. For those of you that are interested just head over to EverQuest.com and take a look. The direct link is: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/main/indev.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/main/indev.jsp</a> <br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000096.html"><b>Producer's Letter</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: After some discussion in a zone about the group experience bonuses, I went to find the letter which described how they were changed in January. To my dismay, I could not find the letter anywhere and the patch message archived on various sites only referred you to the letter which is no longer up. Is there some way we can access the information which was in that patch? Thank you. <br><br>Taerianaya of Innoruuk Server ]</i></font><br><br>The 'Producer's Letter' section of our web site has an archive. There is a dropdown box on the top of the page that will lead you to the letters that have been archived. Some aren't there, but the one you are looking for is.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000097.html"><b>Ceremonial Wedding Sword</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Despite the nice stat bonuses associated with this weapon, there is no reason to weild it because it has no melee stats. It takes the primary slot only, to boot!! <br><br>Is this a bug, and will it be fixed? This item has been this way since Velious release, and as it is, is broken, IMHO. <br><br>There are a lot of us out there with these rotting in the bank and no idea as to whether we should Destroy or Keep these, pending a fix. <br><br>I have one of these on two characters as well as a friend with a warrior who greatly desires the look this weapon gives (which, by the way, is really nice!!) <br><br>Given the difficulty in getting to this item (off of Nosja, 5th floor, wedding party,in the Tower of Frozen Shadow), it's only reasonable it should have melee stats. (Risk vs. Reward here definitely comes to mind) I heard tell that it was brought to Ester's attention, but there has been no official word as to when this item will be fixed. <br><br>There has been argument that it is "not* broken because it's named a "Ceremonial" item but there are other equippable "Ceremonial" daggers and whatnot that *do* have melee stats. <br><br>Can you throw us a bone here??? <br><br>Garaz - Valor of Virtopia<br>Povar - 50th Warrior ]</i></font><br><br>It is a ceremonial sword, a decoration. It is not intended to have any use in combat. <br><br>In fact, the term 'ceremonial' was intended to be used only on items such at this. The fact that there are other items with that term attached to them is probably an error.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000093.html"><b>Bolts, Harvest II and No Drop items </b></a><br>Batugan12 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Are there any plans to use the "Bolt" spell animation for future wizard spells? I think it's a neat spell effect, and I miss using my lower level bolt spells just to see the animation! <br><br>Also, is there any plans to add a Harvest II to the wizard spell line? The Bane spells are going to be helpful at 60, but can you can something for those wizards 50-59? <br><br>Also, is there a way to perhaps sell NO DROP items? The reason I ask is that I've collected some nice items (Dracnid Thyxl, etc.) that when I find a better item, I can't give the old item away or sell it or anything. Just seems a waste to destroy it. Maybe have a vendor that buys arcane items, and sells nothing? <br><br>Thanks! ]</i></font><br><br>It is possible that we could use the 'bolt' spell effect on future spells, but we don't have any plans to do so at this time. I agree with you on the effect. I have been known to try to time a bolt spell to get it to do very unusual things, like double back on the target or fly off into the distance. I managed once to achieve both goals and had a bolt go past the target, double back just as the creature died and fly right at me! <br><br>There are no plans at this time to add a Harvest II spell. <br><br>As for selling No Drop items&#8230; well, the whole idea of No Drop items is that they can't be passed on or sold for profit. This is done so that people that want such an item will be more inclined to go get it themselves for their own use. Allowing people to sell them, even just to a vendor would defeat that purpose.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If the vendor could not resell the item then where is the problem? You could even have the vendor offer a small fraction of the actual value of the item. <br><br>Darkley<br>Master poker of holes in logic. Exceptional corpse runner.<br>Tallon Zek]</i></font> <br><br>Which leads me to the question; if the amount of cash gained for selling the item is trivial, then why allow them to be sold at all? If it's not a trivial amount, then we would be breaking the idea of No Drop items. <br><br>I understood that the vendor would not resell it, I figured that went without saying. :)<br><br>No Drop items are No Drop to reduce the desire to gain one for any reason beyond using it yourself. That's the intent.</UL>

Alan spoke for a while on the status of the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000087.html">Class Talk Threads</a> in a recent update on the Dev Corner.  Here's the entire post:<UL><i>We have been receiving a fair amount of mail regarding the status of changes to classes based on the items brought up in the class talk threads that I started a while ago. Right now I have little new information for you, but let me spend a moment talking about this.<br><br>The team has read and reviewed the lists that I put together. We've had several informal discussions about them, and a few formal discussions about specific items on those lists.<br><br>So far you've seen a lot of changes based on your input. They have been going into the game as they get finished and tested. Things that didn't require a lot of in-depth investigation on our part, such as changing the Bread Pants for Bards, increasing the drop rates for many Kunark spells, fixing the Track Corpse spell and many others.<br><br>And even some of the more complicated issues have been looked into. Things like giving Druids and Shaman the ability to act as secondary healers, upgrading Mark of Karn (a very complicated spell to balance), the aggro created by debuff spells (and, yes, the aggro created by healing spells), and others that have required a lot of consideration have been added or changed.<br><br>We've also started on some of the much more complicated issues, such as Wizards and their ability to do damage against certain NPCs with the Bane spells.<br><br>To finish the lists we'll have to make the time to have some long and complicated meetings over issues that can't be changed without rather a lot of effect on the game world. We have not had those meeting yet. Recently we decided that we would put PvP issues to the forefront, considering that lack of attention they have had over the life of EverQuest.<br><br>I just wanted to let you know that we haven't forgotten the issues that you brought to our attention.<br><br>Alan</I></UL>

More updates just in from Alan from off of the Developer's Cornder:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000051.html"><b>Mmm...Cake</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Personally, I prefer my cakes made with High Elves baked inside. If not High Elves, then Barbarians will do in a pinch. <br><br>Sinfully Yours,<br>Paradise Perdu <br><br>"Hail! Necromancy, Victorious!" ]</i></font><br><br>Well, hopefully we can reduce the need for you to go to such gruesome extremes. We will be improving the drop rate for brownie parts with the next patch. Other than that we'll probably be waiting for the other food related changes to work their magic before making other changes.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000004.html"><b>More Graphic Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just a note about this. Not sure if it has been noted in other threads (but it should be in this thread). If you are using a Glide capable card (voodoo 4 & 5), by default EQ sets your video driver to the Glide driver. Got back to the first screen of EQ (Where the "Connect" button is), and select options. That will bring up the video driver options you have available for EQ. Make sure that "Primary Display Driver" is selected and not the "Glide" driver. <br><br>Things should work fine after that as long as your video card is capable of the 32 bit mode. <br><br>Regards, <br><br>CJ ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the tip. Yes, the 32bit option will not work if you're using glide drivers. CJs suggestion is a good one.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000088.html"><b>Panic Animal</b></a><br>Dmiedema wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Not sure which board this is supposed to be posted in, so I posted in both.

You should see them after the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000086.html"><b>Pathing Problems?</b></a><br>Normally we would want you to send your pathing problems to the Quality Assurance &#8211; Testing form, but I wanted to bring special attention to this for a while, and to respond to a comment that we received. First, the comment: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: Pathing at the Ry'gorr camp in Eastern Wastes <br><br>This has been something of a problem since I've hunted there. It can be avoided, but sometime it can be fatal or abused. Let me explain: <br><br>The pathing inside the main house at the Ry'Gorr camp in the Eastern Wastes is horrible! It's almost non-existant. For instance, if you pull anything from inside the house, you have to be careful not to outrun it and keep it in a straight line and lead it out the doorways. The orcs are programmed to run in a straight line towards you, no matter what. <br><br>If you do not lead them out yourself and they get caught in a wall or doorway, they continue to run in place trying to get to you. After about 15 seconds or so, they will "magically" drop from the sky and attack you. Most of the time, they get in a few free hits. I have found that it doesn't matter how much distance you put between you and the orc, whether you are running or standing still, or any other variant makes a difference. They WILL catch you. And these free hits can be fatal if you are a caster, especially if the Chief is along. Even if you survive, these orcs run at Jboot speed and are now in the correct distance to keep smacking you til you die. <br><br>Another problem area is the balcony in the chief/oracle room. If you stand anywhere close to that doorway but don't enter the room, you pretty much can assure yourself that you have aggroed the Chief and his Elites. Again, with the fact that they run in a straight line towards you and you don't see the message that they have aggroed on you, it's a rude awakening to have all 3 of them drop from the sky on you. <br><br>This also works for any orc that happens to spawn on the walls outside the house if you sit in the house. They aggro on you and drop from the ceiling and begin combat. Sometimes they land on the roof and continue to hit you. <br><br>There is only one time where these orcs follow any kind of pathing, and that is when you fear them. Then will run from whatever direction they come from, counter-clockwise around the bonfire room, and out the doorway. They then run outside the walls of the camp and continue up the hill and into the snow. <br><br>Another problem I had was I was fleeing from the Chief. I ran completely outside the camp and up a nearby hill. Being a level 51 necro, I always have DMF cast on me and I proceeded to run off the hill and float over the wall and back into the camp, making a break for the Crystal Caverns orb. Now when I made the wall, the Chief was close behind me but had not caught me yet. I get to the gate and try and open it. Now, this is the only gate in the game that I found hitting the "U" key does not open. In fact, you miss half the time trying to left click that gate to get it open. Can you also check into why you can't hit "U" and open it? Anyway, I finally get the gate open, just barely get inside when the Chief appears and slays me instantly. He managed to get by a wall and a second room wall to get to me in a matter of seconds. <br><br>Now the place where this can be abused is the fact that you can turn the orc tactics against them. This tactic is mostly used by wizards and druids. They run into the house invisible and target themselves an orc. Then they run outside the house and get as far as possible and snare the targetted orc. They can still cast at the orc even though they are outside and the orc is inside. This usually gives them many free hits before the orc appears and hits them. <br><br>So my question is this: Is there a way to fix the pathing in this camp? Possibly give these orcs a set way to run out of the camp and avoid getting snagged running in place? I know it's part of an outdoor zone so the "line of sight" doesn't apply it seems... but perhaps at least giving the orcs a way to stop dropping from the sky would be great. They already run very fast so I don't see where the extra time would hurt. <br><br>Thanks for looking into this if you can! I hope to avoid another 5-death day like I had a few weeks ago due to this pathing. <br><br>--Cy ]</i></font><br><br>First of all, I wanted to thank you for the detailed description. It helps us a lot in these situations when you give us all the details. The only item that you didn't send us that might have been useful would be a few /locs for key problem points. These make it a lot easier for us to find specific areas that need attention. <br><br>The bad news is that there isn't much that we can do to fix this problem. The code that allows the NPC to pop directly to you is needed in the zone to prevent exploits. And it seems that you know how to avoid the problem, it just requires that you be very careful when pulling not to get too far ahead of them. <br><br>Now, on to my request. <br><br>What I would like to ask all of you is this. Reply to this post with places that you've found pathing problems. We can't fix them all, but we want to know about them and fix the ones that we can fix. Like I said, normally we would want you to send such things to the Quality Assurance folks. And after a short while I'll probably just lock this thread and ask you to again send your pathing issues to Quality Assurance. But for now I'm hoping to generate a few more responses on this issue so that we can focus a little effort on it. <br><br><b>Please</b> be specific about the location and NPC names involved. But at the same time please try not to include a lot of extraneous information. We don't really need to know about the whole adventure that you had to get to the pathing problem, just the problem itself. One of our talented designers is going to be reading your messages, and we'd like to use his time as efficiently as possible. <br><br>Keep in mind that some of these problems just can't be fixed due to limitations in the game engine. But we'll fix what we can. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000085.html"><b>Player-baked Food Stat Bonuses</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I read this rumor on the Prexus General Messages boards. Raises interesting questions, if it's not a hoax. The essence of the rumor is that foods made with the Baking skill (didn't see if it was all foods or just some recipes) can now confer stat bonuses. They can also be right-clicked to be eaten immediately, but last half the duration of other foods (i.e. you get hungry again sooner). <br><br>1) Will you eat the food automatically if it's at the top of your inventory? If so, who would ever right-click on it if you could get full-duration effects by always eating baker-made food? <br><br>1a) If you do automatically eat the baker-made food, does that simply mean that consumption rate is doubled? Kind of a poor trade-off for first having to either raise your tradeskill or buy the food (at what will be sure to be inflated prices) from skilled bakers, then have it only last half the time a regular stack of food would? <br><br>1b) Does the food's effect last until you next consume food, or does it wear off sooner? Or does it possibly decline slowly over that period (decreasing the effect as you get "hungrier")? <br><br>2) Do multiple foodstuffs have stacking effects? For instance, could I click on three different foods to eat them all, and get three stacking stat bonuses, or would the second overwrite the first, third overwrite the second, etc.? <br><br>3) Any foods planned to affect not only stat bonuses, but saves as well? Something like Polar Bear Pie (just made that up) which gives +5 SV Cold? Edible Goo gives +2 SV Poison? <br><br>4) When will Brewers be able to make drinks that do something besides get you drunk? I'd like to be able to brew a drink that confers (albeit small) beneficial effects with no negative effects... even it meant that the drinks lasted half as long like baked foods. Brew some Green Tea and get a stamina boost, or Hot Chocolate to get SV Cold... You get the idea. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Feydakin ]</i></font><br><br>There is a patch message on Test server that explains most of this. Let me copy the pertinent part of the patch message: <br><br><i>quote: <br><br>Baking and Food Changes: <br>Now when you right click on a food or drink, it will describe how sustaining that food or drink is. *Note* The message and food values are subject to change over the next week or two as they are being balanced. <br><br>Now you can right click on a food or drink item to consume it just like alcohol. Currently consuming food this way only provides half of the sustaining value of the food. There is also a limit as to how much food and drink you can consume at once. <br><br>Some player prepared foods and drinks now have statistic modifications. These are once again most likely to change during the next week as they are being balanced. </i><br><br>So let me answer your questions to the best of my ability. Keep in mind that all of this is still being tested. It is entirely possible that none of this will go live, or that it will end up working differently when we're done testing. <br><br>1) Yes, you will still consume the topmost food and drink (excluding alcohol) in your inventory. You might prefer to choose to eat a food for a few reasons. Your character might be a glutton. Or, more likely, you might want to gain the benefits that can be gained from eating a certain food type right away rather than waiting for it to be eaten naturally. <br><br>1a) I'm not sure I understand the question, so I'll shotgun some answers. Each food item will have a duration that it feed you. Automatically eating them allows them to last that given duration. Forcing them down your throat will only allow them to last half as long as they would normally. The sustenance duration of player made foods will be set at whatever value seems appropriate. I doubt that all of them will last half as long as store bought foods. In fact, I would imagine that they will in some cases last longer. Remember, not all player made food will have some special bonus to it. <br><br>1b) I don't know how bonuses from food will be treated. I'll know more once we've fiddled with it a bit. <br><br>2) Much like my answer to 1b), I don't really know. We'll let you know more when we've finalized more. <br><br>3) Actually, the only food item that I've heard about so far specifically is the Scorpion Sandwich that was the first one created to test with. It gave (and might still give) a +1 to poison saves. <br><br>4) I don't know the specific plans for brewing. Again, I'll have more details once we've more testing time. <br><br>I'm sorry that I don't have more details on this. It's still early in testing and I don't have a lot of details for you. But I think you'll like the results. I'll get back to you with more information when we're closer to finalizing it all.</UL>

Alan kicked up a few of his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000074.html">thoughts and impressions</a> taken from the recent Fan Faire event in San Diego recently.  Here's the post directly from the Developer's Corner:<UL><i>As a follow up, I wanted to thank everyone that attended the Faire, both players and staff. It seems that everyone had a good time. It's always nice to meet people with similar interests. I went home with a few impressions:<br><br>Players on PvP servers are <b>not</b> mean in person. :) I don't know how it is that I gained, someplace in the back of my mind, the idea that players on a Zek server would be sort of dangerous in person. I'm sorry if I don't remember any names, but I wanted to thank the father-son team that spent so long talking to me and making me laugh.<br><br>Even the old jokes are kinda funny if you're in a room with a lot of other people that can groan at them with you. For a few years now we've been hearing the same camping, spawning and SoW jokes. They actually seemed a little fresher when in a room full of 1,200 people that understood them.<br><br>It does rain in San Diego. I know it's not my fault, but I'm sorry that it decided to rain on us all at the Faire. It doesn't seem fair&#8230;<br><br>I just wanted to let you all know that the Live team had a lot of fun. We talked a bit about it in the meeting today, and it seems that we all had a good time. I wanted to express their thanks to you all for making it so.<br><br>And it was nice to see people cheering for their GMs and praising their Guides. Those folks work hard to help people out, and I was glad to see that you folks were so kind to them, they deserve it.<br><br>But Fan Faire is about the fans. So I was wondering what you all thought about the event. If you have any non-dirty tales to relate, let me know. <br><br>Alan</i></UL>

Here's the round-up of the few updates Alan made to the Developer's Corner today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000082.html"><b>Plane of Mischief Items To Become No-Drop</b></a><br>There is a rather extensive list of items from this plane that will become No Drop with the next patch. I'm not going to list them all, as it's probable that some of these items are unknown to many at this point, and I'm not going to spoil any surprises. <br><br>So if you have any items that originated in the Plane of Mischief that you were thinking about trading, do so before the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000084.html"><b>Sit On & Off</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: A Few changes <br><br>I have only two suggestions. First, since there is a /sit command, why not a /stand command? Currently I have to type /book and then hit "i" to stand up that way. <br>The second was more of a question than a suggestion. I heard rumors a while back about letting the players buy in bulk. That is to say, buy more than one of an item at a time, like full stacks if we wanted to. I don't see why this would be a problem. If it is the fact that maybe we don't have the money for it, then just let it buy as much as we have money for. Am I making sense? Anyway, I would appreciate an e-mail response if it is possible. Thank you. <br><br>Emoth Lasundi of The Guardians of Innoruuk<br>Karan Server ]</i></font><br><br>Well, programmers are an unusual lot. When setting up the /sit function they treated it like any other function that just toggles between two states (in this case, sitting and not sitting) <br><br>The command is /sit on (which can be shortened to /sit) and /sit off (which makes you stand). <br><br>I just use the Stand/Sit button and turn it into a hot key. <br><br>We're still looking into purchasing in bulk.

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Necromancers</a>.  What do you know about them?  You've grouped with them sure, maybe you even are one.  Necromancers are the masters of the dead, reaching beyond the bounds of the grave to magically manipulate their dark minions. With the ability to command an undead being the Necromancer makes an impressive group member but they can also solo most effectively. But how much do you really know about these undead masters of Norrath?<br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the wicked undead masters of the realms.  Running around with skeletons isn't all that necromancers can do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Necromancers of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

Our esteemed Mr. Shadoe has been busy as of late.  Aside from his normal duties as a columnist and author in the EQ community, he's also traveled a good chunk of the country recently.  His latest <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid986865696,81679,">report centers around the Fan Faire event</a> held in San Diego over the weekend.  It is most definitely a read not to miss as this clip will show you:<UL>So, after 750 miles and $1000 later we discovered what was once kosher had suddenly turned into the proverbial Sausage McMuffin with Egg in the face of the Torah. This, friends, is what two years of volunteered time and service amounts to in the guide program. When someone's word is checked, double-checked, relied upon and it still falls through in the end, something is definitely not right. <br><br>Doubly so when you consider the fact that Verant's own Mrs. Butler didn't even have the guts to fight her own battles. Instead of coming out and denying us access face-to-face, she opted to enlist our gracious host, a GM, and an elder guide to do her dirty work as she hid herself behind closed doors. Mrs. Butler effectively quailed away from facing down a 5'6" housewife in the same way a tobacco company quails away from cogent empirical evidence. Such cowardice speaks volumes to this member of the press, and it paints a vivid picture of the way things can often be in the guide program under her majestic rule. But to be fair, what does one expect coming from an employee who just happened to be dating (and later married) a prominent Verant staff member at the time she was hired to fill the position? </UL>As always, a new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=10642205&start=10642205">feedback/response thread</a> has been activated on our General Board.

Hitting the Developer's Corner after a big weekend, here's all of what Alan had to say today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000081.html"><b>The Cat Who Walked Through Walls</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Forgive the Heinlein quote, I couldn't resist :)<br><br>I am a new player, so this question may be long since answered but I could not find it anywhere so thought I would ask it anyhow. Creatures can see and walk through walls. This appears to be common knowledge, something I found out the hard way. <grin> <br><br>I was prepared to simply shrug and live with it until a madman came in out of the desert and killed me through a wall while I was shopping. Is there a plan in place to change/repair this 'feature'? <br><br>Again apologies if this is a repetition. Oh, and thanks for creating a new addiction for me! :)<br><br>Alerius the (all singing all dancing) Bard ]</i></font><br><br>Quoting Heinlein titles is fine with me. A good bard needs to be aware of the great bards, after all. <br><br>Yes, that question has been asked several times. But I'm more than willing to answer it again. <br><br>Creatures walk through certain walls on purpose. The huts and inns you see out in the plains of Norrath, such as those out in the Commons near Freeport, don't prevent the passage of NPCs because if they did they would be easily abused. For example, Hill Giants would not be able to attack a player character through the roof of the inn, but you might be able to stab at his feet. And creatures used to get stuck against the geometry of those buildings all the time. So, while we certainly understand that it seems strange to have a bear wander through the walls of a hut, it's something that needed to be done.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000080.html"><b>New PvP Server</b></a><br>Jera300 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'ver heard references that the next server to be released will be a PvP server. I am very excited about this, would it be possible that this will be a new server, instead of a split server? It would be nice to start out with everyone on the same footing (ie:less twinking). Any information on this would be helpful. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I don't have much to tell you all yet. We did announce at the Fan Faire that the next server we bring up will be a PvP server, and that that server will have some new rules. I'll announce more when we've firmed up the details.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000079.html"><b>Support For Windows ME</b></a><br>Bullshmidt wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor- <br><br>I was wondering if Verant ws planning on suporting Windows ME for Everquest. I was wondering this because many of the large computer manufactures (Dell, HP, Gateway and Compaq for example) are begining to ship their high end home computers with Windows ME pre-installed. <br><br>Thanks. <br><br>Sperhawk Rocsword<br>40 Enchanter, Rabid Reich<br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br>While we don't 'officially' support ME, EverQuest runs on it just fine. Let me, once again, just quote Kendrick, who seems to be the featured Dev guy of the week. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Everquest works fine with Windows ME. Most of the (very few!) compatibility issues were from the days when ME required you to install DirectX 7.0 as part of the OS, and EQ was still using DX5. <br><br>Since we did the switch to DX7 prior to Velious, it's something of a non-issue. <br><br>There may be some older graphics cards that don't have DX7/8 drivers, but those folks can't play EQ now, no matter what OS they're using. ]</i></font><br><br>So if you are running ME and are seeing issues, make sure that you've checked the other potential problems (usually sound or video drivers) before thinking it's the operating system. It might be something you can fix more easily than changing OS's&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000019.html"><b>Roleplaying or Just Playing?</b></a><br>StormFront wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I happened to be looking through various posts and discovered the Role-Playing or Just Playing comments. I thought I would just give my thoughts. <br><br>First I have a High Elf Paladin, and have wondered about the way others would precieve my character when he comes across gruff with the evil races. Not wanting to party with them and such so I created a Dark Elf ShadowKnight just to see what the attitude of the land was towards those characters. To my surprise most people seemed to enjoy playing the DE and even though they were despied it never seemed to affect them. On a couple of occassions I have witnessed true DE tactics at work. Once I saw a DE ShadowKnight ask to join a group which sent these RPs in total hysteria, just to have the DE walk off gleeful he had stirred them up. Take it for what it's worth. <br><br>I also have a Wood Elf Druid, I understand the statement that we are to be the protectors of nature. However there is a fine line and others have asked how a Druid could attack a wildlife entity. My answer has been that of what most Native American believe which is how I feel the Druids must have been like(Though I admit I could be totally wrong). Druids wish to protect there environment but understand that they must live upon it and have no problem with the hunting of an animal as long as the entire animal is used and not wasted on momentary gain or sport. The senseless killing of many animals would get to them, but using them for food or clothing is acceptable as long as done with respect to them and not meaning a massacare of everything. I work with tailoring but kill only to equipment myself and for food when I am low and a town or merchant is not available.<br> <br>However I can see instances where role-playing becomes difficult especially when stakes are high. When your after that important item or you have lost your corpse and can not locate it and it has the offering you have to make to your god for a specific quest (just an example). Would you be willing to bend your character to accomplish these? In real life you sometimes have to swallow hard and deal with a situation. Perhaps allowing a character to be designed with regards to who they can group with and who they can not, dependent on their deity. If you were to lock out charcters from grouping solely because of race or class then you lose a bit of the reality. Maybe instead they suffer a faction hit and will need a way to correct for it, just a thought. A kind of atonement for their transgression. Having a instance where a character can deviate from normal can add something to the fabric that we call Norrath, making the area even more unknown. I have enjoyed RPing sometimes it is just interesting to determine why someone might act the way they do and come up with the reason even if they are wrong or not. I myself would like the ability to select the races or classes that I might fear or shun, granted there should be automatics, since I could have a quirky personality and noone is quite sure why. <br><br>Sorry to be so long but that is my thoughts about it, I think it would be fun to play on an RP server! ]</i></font><br><br>I think it's great that you've taken the extra step to play on both sides of the fence. A lot of people will play a single class or race for a long time and perhaps fail to understand some of the issues involved in playing one of the classes that they don't normally get along with. I'm not talking about 'my class is better than your class' stuff, but about how the communities work. For example, I've gotten the impression over the last two years that folks playing Dwarves tend to be more likely to roleplay than others. I don't know why, or if it's even true, but I've played at least a little as every race in the game, and I think it's true. Or I've noticed that it is a lot easier to be in-character when playing a good cleric than an evil cleric. As a 'good' cleric, it's easy enough to heal people when they ask. But for an 'evil' cleric this just might not be in-character (though it can be). <br><br>It is always easiest to abandon roleplaying when it comes to the 'high stakes' stuff. The temptation is great. And most of the time it's in-character to do such things as dealing with a necro to help get your corpse, even if your character might normally never do such a thing. High stakes for the player is usually high stakes for the character as well (your character doesn't want to lose his stuff either). But there are cases where you should sacrifice what you want for what your character wants. When the two desires are not the same, roleplaying means putting the character's desires first. <br><br>And I do agree that it seems that the best way to 'enforce' any sort of roleplaying (though I don't really like the idea of 'forced' roleplaying) would be along the lines of deity restrictions. How easy that would be to do in EverQuest I don't know&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I specialize in Halflings, and role-play everyone to the tee. It is my favorite part of EQ. I am the leader of a Small Races Only Guild and we exclusively roleplay, especially the worshipers of Bristlebane. <br><br>I think the idea of a Roleplaying Only server is great...only, could it be a new server where everyone has to start over at level one, no switch-over characters and high level twinks from other servers. That way everyone can start at the same level, and grow as a server together. Just a thought. <br><br>This board format is great!! <br><br>Apathos<br>From a lot of Servers and a lot of Personas, all Halflings ]</i></font><br><br>I know of a few Trolls that specialize in Halflings too&#8230; <br><br>IF there were to ever be such a thing as a server with rules built with roleplaying in mind, then it's my opinion that it would have to be a non-split server. You're right, a server like that would need to grow up under the new rules. <br><br>Dulc wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Up until March, my husband and I had played on only non-pvp servers. We love to roleplay, but eventually gave it up for the most part, because too many players reacted in a negative way. We had a paladin and cleric couple, for which the paladin was my Champion. He played it very chivalrous and honorable, no thees or thous, but maybe the use of "m'lady, m'lord, sir, mistress" etc. made people feel uncomfortable. We had reactions ranging from disgust to apologetic. There were a few that jumped right in and roleplayed with us, but for the most part it was a struggle. <br><br>Anyway, a friend offered to help us discover Tallon Zek through a roleplay story and we accepted. What a difference! Suddenly we were fearing for our lives, not just from npc's but from characters for which we had no idea what they might do. We are playing "shorties" and the added threat of the "dark alliance" has just enhanced the roleplay. This make me think that a roleplay server should be pvp, but with a safety net around the cities. On non-pvp servers, people can say whatever they wish with no reprecussions for the most part. But if a "light" race challenges a "dark" race in pvp, you may have the whole zone on your back. So yes, I personally am enjoying roleplaying a dislike of the evil races on Tallon Zek. But I wouldn't do it on a non-pvp server. Hope that makes sense. :)]</i></font><br><br>Well, it can be argued that the use of thee and thou wouldn't be appropriate for roleplaying in Norrath, as none of the cultures really use it, as far as I know. I've seen the same thing, though. People getting uncomfortable with use of more, um, flowery language. But then, I get uncomfortable around the use of words like 'plz' and 'r'. :)<br><br>Fear is a useful roleplaying tool. I don't think that it can be the basis of roleplaying in EverQuest on its own, though. I understand your point, though. The idea that you can attack another character based on whatever rules are set up tends to improve the interaction between those characters. On a standard server a High Elf is limited in the ways that he can express his dislike for Dark Elves in exactly the same way that he can't express his dislike of a rude Wood Elf. On Tallon Zek the High Elf has the ability to be more aggressive to a Dark Elf than to a rude Wood Elf, and that tends to make the willingness to be aggressive towards Dark Elves higher. <br><br>Kingfish01 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: No, no, no. You are absolutely wrong, and that's what frustrates me about EQ. <br><br>Your idea that "pacifists make poor adventurers" is patently false, but indicates why EQ is a challenge for roleplayers. <br><br>Now, I've enjoyed reading these comments and your responses abou this, but I must take issue with you. <br><br>Because of its design, EQ has no room for explorers, historians, cartographers, merchants, sages, hermits and evangelists (is not faith an important issue for EQ characters?). Why can't these characters exist? Because EQ only tolerates combat oriented roleplay. <br><br>Why can't players be multi classed, changing careers later in life? Why can't they experience conversion and change faith? I enjoy EQ, but your gameworld exists in a narrow box. <br><br>Adventure involves more than killing things, but EQ is almost exclusively about killing things. EQ is fundamentally a "kill something so you can kill something bigger" game. It's quests almost always involve the death of an NPC. But it doesn't have to be this way!!! <br><br>EQ SHOULD have ways for player to gain experience in other ways. The easiest would be to award experience for successful skill development. It should be possible for a player to be a 30th level blacksmith, tailor, or whatever, and still not be able to fight their way out of a paper bag. In theory, this is possible, but is unreasonable. Tradeskills depend on high level spells and materials, making it necessary for Master craftsmen to be also master casters for the most part. <br><br>Personally I think it is a programming cop-out to make almost all experience gain related to killing things. A little creative thinking could expand the roleplaying aspects of the game immensely, without sacrificing anything that currently exists. <br><br>Sorry for the rant, but it frustrates me that EQ could be so much better, but I don't see that happening. ]</i></font><br><br>Pacifists DO make poor adventurers. There's nothing false about that statement. <br><br>What I think you disagree with is that adventuring is a poor focus for roleplaying. I disagree. <br><br>While the focus of EverQuest is adventuring (much like most pen and paper games), it certainly doesn't exclude the roles that you've mentioned. Explorers certainly have a place in Norrath. Explorers in a dangerous world are basically adventurers anyway. Historians, cartographers, merchants, sages&#8230; all of these are not roles on their own. If you are playing a cartographer that likes to sit around the house and read maps, or a historian that likes to read history but doesn't like to talk to others about it, then you don't really need a multiplayer game. Hermit is so much not a roleplaying idea (sure, the GM could use it, but as a player character a hermit would never, ever, be in a game&#8230; Evangelists would be something that would be hard to do in EverQuest. <br><br>Yes, you can play a cartographer in EverQuest, and play one well. But I won't argue that such a character is somewhat limited by the mechanics and content of the game. Most certainly you can't make and sell (or give away) maps in game. That is partially a design limitation, but primarily a technological one. EverQuest does not have any sort of automated map making system by design. But then if it did, who would need a cartographer. As for drawing your own maps in game, that is more of a technology issue than a design one (or, if you want, it was a design decision not to develop the technology to allow such a thing). <br><br>But none of the careers you mentioned are directly prohibited by the game itself. In most cases where they are limited the limitation comes from technology or time restrictions, not a desire to hinder roleplaying. The best example would be your evangelist. Despite the fact that you can't actually change the little word(s) on the character description that the player sees, you most certainly could 'convert' people. You could convince them to work for the betterment of your chosen deity. You could convince them to do things that would bring their faction in line with the factions best suited to your deity. You could convert someone to your religion if the player of that character was convinced that his character would be converted. <br><br>No, the game doesn't really support such activity with gameplay features. We can't support all such features. I wish it were technologically and monetarily feasible. <br><br>Oh, and it is possible to be a 30th level tailor and still not be able to fight your way out of a paper bag. It would be really hard, but it could be done. <br><br>There's no cop-out here. To program a game (and get it done before the programmers die of old age) a feature set must be chosen. Some things won't make it, everything can't make it. <br><br>We just work day to day to get closer to the perfect game. <br><br>Sorry, that was a bit long-winded. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Part of the problem with roleplaying is the designers don't always consider those that want to roleplay when they do the quest. <br><br>Example: Iksar monks have to worship Cazic Thule, yet to do their Epic Quest, they have to gain the respect of the human monk guilds, one of which is dedicated to Quellious. An iksar "properly" roleplayed shouldn't have to do human quest. <br><br>Azzad ]</i></font><br><br>Well you can look at this two ways. First, if your Iksar wants to trick the stupid Humans into liking him so that he can gain something he wants, there's no need to sacrifice any roleplaying. <br><br>But if your Iksar is not the type of lizard that would do such a thing (an honorable lizard-monk), then don't do it. I see people using the word 'forced' to get an item all the time. Your Iksar does not 'have' to do a human quest. That's one of those things that I talked about before. It's one of those decisions where you either choose to roleplay and not get something that the player wants so that the character can remain true. If your Iksar doesn't want to do the quest because it's not in his character, having him do it is a concession to the player. <br><br>I know that the argument here is that the Iksar should be able to get the item by some other route. That an Iksar monk should be equally able to get that item if his player is roleplaying or if he's not. I don't agree. I, personally, like the idea that some paladins (as this is the most common example) will be able to roleplay in a world where they get to make a hard decision. Fair isn't a part of roleplaying. So while it might be fair to argue that from a game design standpoint such a quest is unfair, it's wrong to do so from a roleplaying standpoint. <br><br>Anyway, keep in mind that a lot of my reply in this post is my personal opinion. <br><br>As a representative of the company, I will send your concern about the quest to the team. I know a guy that's interested in looking into that sort of thing. :)</UL>

A <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid986865403,64421,">follow-up to <i>Where Silence Reigns</I></a>, one of Shadoe's latest editorials, has been published this evening.  The message board thread spawned by the editorial contained some very intense discussions.  Here's a clip of what Shadoe thought:<UL>Needless to say, I was a fish swimming upstream with this one. The EQ Vault poll showed the public was against my standpoint by a margin of 17% at the time I wrote it. Knowing this, I was prepared for one heated debate to ensue on the discussion thread, and I wasn't disappointed. Posters waxed rhapsotic about my siding with Verant, asking if I was on their payroll, accusing me of deliberately skewing my viewpoint -- all of which were highly amusing to see unfold. It's interesting to see the extents people resort to when they're out of new ideas, even to the point of saying that "blaming the [players/customers/escaped mental patients] is the most absurd thing I've heard you utter." An easy thing to say, and it's flawlessly in line with my expectations. <br><br>You see, I recognized the poll results for what they were: a golden opportunity to express my opinion on the matter while at the same time allowing the readers to exemplify my point in the discussion thread. So please indulge me, if you will, and take a good, hard look at the conversation that took place there. Read both sides of the argument. Feel the controversy. Taste the controversy. BE the controversy! </UL>I also wanted to quickly plug in <a href="http://express.stratics.com/credits/shadoe.htm">Shadoe's section at the Otherworld Express</a> where he is currently working on an EverQuest novel called <i>The Pact of Zeranon</I>.<br><br>Check it out!

Dynamite Shortfuze sent in this announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail good wizards of Norrath!<br><br>I come before you today with news of Fennin Ro's first ever Wizard<br>Faire! In months past, I have hosted a Rune Trade on Fennin Ro, and the<br>time has come to expand upon this, with a huge faire... for wizards!<br><br>I'm hoping that this can be held on the 28th of April. I know, it's very<br>early to discuss this, and I don't even know myself if I will be<br>available, but I've been getting pressure to start announcing it<br>(especially from Omnip, who is possibly the Faire's biggest supporter).<br>Let me explain how it works...<br><br>Before, at the rune faires, wizards of all levels would come together.<br>We would discuss life and have fun (the Ol'Tujim's Fierce Brew helped<br>with that I'm sure), but most prominently, we would trade runes. If you<br>needed a rune, you would ask if anyone had it, and you would likely<br>receive it. Conversely, if you had a rune someone else needed, you would<br>offer it to them. Higher level wizards were on hand to assist lower<br>levels in the research of their spells, and fun was had by all.<br><br>No changes are being made to that. We're just expanding on it. This<br>month, we will have contests, games, duels, the rune trade, and above<br>all, fun!<br><br>I would like to offer prizes of cash and items for this event, but as<br>this is an independant project and not one of any guild with a large<br>support base, my income restricts this from being much good. I can offer<br>prizes just fine, they just won't be good in many respects. So much so<br>that prizes would probably have just as much impact if they weren't<br>present. However, if you have any donations of items or cash that you<br>would like to put forward to this, please contact me in-game and let me<br>know. I won't ask that you give it to me until the event (since I can't<br>guaruntee my presence just yet), but I would like to know that these<br>things are available so I can plan ahead with them in mind. If you can't<br>get to me in-game, please contact me at<br><br><a href="mailto:fenninrunes@hotmail.com">fenninrunes@hotmail.com</a><br><br>Also, I am just one wizard, and in past trades, I have had JUST enough<br>alcohol to please the masses. So if you'd like to bring some of your own<br>brew for all to sample, please, I wholeheartedly encourage it!<br><br>We have a few games in mind, and Omnip has some that she won't tell me<br>about (she says it's a surprise and she'll post it on the boards<br>herself), but we can only get better with help. So, if you've got an<br>idea for a game, again, contact me with the procedure and rules at<br><br><a href="mailto:fenninrunes@hotmail.com">fenninrunes@hotmail.com</a><br><br>I'm really looking forward to this month, I expect it's going to be the<br>best we've had yet!

However I feel that there is a severe lack in EQ's interest in the early to mid level player. Everytime I turn around I see a listing somewhere for some new fantastic item, or a new neat spell, or a new interesting quest and they all seem to be designed around the 40th, 50th, or higher levels. I fully understand the developer's trying to keep the game interesting for the veteran players, but I must admit I feel left out. I see little or no development of new quests, spells, or magical items designed around the 10th to 25th level characters. Where are the new items, quests, and spells to make it interesting for our levels. If I see one more item showing up on the third party web sites that require killing some 50th level mob, or require that you enter the most diabolical dungeon, or traveling across 3 continents and camping for 40 hours I'm just gonna scream. I think it's time for the developer's to put stuff out there that us poor souls who have only been here a few months can look forward to. Something I can achieve with others my level. Not something I have to hope that some 54th level character is willing to sell for a mere 3000pp, which of course I have in my back pocket at any given time. Unless I'm not understanding the intent of the developers, I feel a little slighted. Sorry about the rambling. What do you think? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, our most recent addition was designed specifically for the level of character that you are talking about. The Warrens is exactly as you describe, a whole zone for lower level characters. Whatever impression you are taking away from reading web sites is going to be based on what the owners of that site find interesting. For the most part there will always be more 'hype' about the high level game and items and all that. That's what seems to interest people. Those that have characters that are of the level that they can think about getting that stuff are interested in hearing about it. But so are those that are looking ahead to what they might be doing later in the game. <br><br>That doesn't mean that we are not adding content for the early parts of the game, as you can see with The Warrens.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000065.html"><b>Crafted Armor & Magic Damage</b></a><br>WindigoA wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a question about crafted armor being classified as "magic" and what that really means in terms of fighting a monster that can only be damaged by magic weapons. <br><br>I was fighting willowisps a couple months ago to get some extra cash and another light stone. I had noticed that throughout my fighting career that the boots I wore determined if I could hit ghouls, wisps, etc with kicks. Regular bronze boots yielded the INVULNERABLE message, while my crafted boots, because they were magic, yielding connecting hits that caused damage. On the flip side later I wanted to work with my hand to hand skill since I am supposed to be a fighting machine as a warrior. I had on crafted gloves that were classified as magic, yet everything such as ghouls and wisps that I tried to fight gave me the INVULNERABLE message when I tried to punch. If kick is a secondary skill but allows us to cause dmg to mobs if magic boots are worn, why is a primary fighting skill like hand to hand not able to share the same effect? I haven't tried this in a couple of months because I haven't seen anything in the patch message to tell me that this issue has been addressed! <br><br>When I petitioned asking if my equipment was bugged, I was told that they had no idea why a magic stat item that caused damage normally would not cause damage to items that can only be hurt by magic items. It was suggested to me that the programmers didn't want to infringe upon my monk friends by allowing warriors and others with hand to hand skill to hurt mobs that required magic weapon damage. I don't think this is a viable answer however since I've never been able to do more than 15 or 20 regular hit damage with my hands. <br><br>Thanks! ]</i></font><br><br>You're correct. Initially, fists were never hurting creatures that required magic weapons to damage. Special coding was added to allow Monks to cause damage to such creatures with magical gloves. It was not given to other classes because it is a special code for Monks. <br><br>Obviously the same thing could have been done with kicking as well, only allowing Monks to kick for damage with magic boots against resistant creatures. But Warriors use kick quite a bit, and so it was decided to let them kick for damage under those circumstances. Or it could have gone the other way. It could have been, as you suggested, that everyone with magic gloves could punch resistant creatures. <br><br>Either of those choices would have been more consistent, I suppose. But it's just a perk for Monks, really. It can easily be explained in game by the fact that Monks are skilled in the use of all their limbs as weapons and that's how they can use magical armor as a weapon. The Warrior only knows how to do so through practice with kicking and that he hasn't the skill with his fists to do so (and you'll find that it's probably true that few Warriors have much skill with Hand to Hand)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000070.html"><b>Darkforge Armor</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As of the patch,Darkforge armor looks exactly as it did before.

From Ubergamer:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings all,<br> <br>First off, I apologize for the lack of updated news on my site. Here's the reason:<br> <br>Well seems one thing led to another, and after reinstalling Windows 98 (to clean out my system) I lost the FTP info I need to connect to my host, Virtual Avenue. So far I've emailed them 5 times and no reply ... <br> <br>So, I may either end up moving my site (again) or just wait it out and hopefully get a reply soon.<br> <br>In the meantime however, for those that requested commissions, if you could resend your commission details I'd appreciate it, since I lost all my emails as well in the re-installation :(. <br> <br>Email: <a href="mailto:ubergamer@home.com">ubergamer@home.com</a><br> <br>Ubergamer<br> <a href="http://wyndrunnerinn.virtualave.net/sketchbook.htm">http://wyndrunnerinn.virtualave.net/sketchbook.htm</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Good luck, we hope you're able to resolve the server problem!

From AllaKhazam:<BLOCKQUOTE>Announcing a new addition to AllaKhazam's Magical<br>Realm.  Now you can use the equipment database, with<br>its over 5,500 Everquest items, and list the items you<br>have for sale for each of your characters (for<br>platinum pieces of course).  This is a great way to<br>sell off items without going through the hassle of<br>/auctioning, and a great way for craftsmen to<br>advertise their wares to the rest of their server.  It<br>is also an easy way to find that item you have always<br>wanted but didn't want to spend the time waiting<br>around hoping it would get auctioned.  All of the<br>items for sale can be searched either by server or<br>right from the item description page.  No auctions and<br>no hassles. All you need to do is arrange through<br>e-mails for the time and place to make the trade. <br>Check it out at <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a>.</BLOCKQUOTE>

I was able to gather these latest updates posted to the Developer's Corner by Alan:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000066.html"><b>Ring of Frozen Flame</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: ring of frozen flame effect serpent sigh from lord djorniariamar is broken effect still and the heat sight mask from velketor is still broken as well. Please fix this me and many other monks in my guild have to use our uv masks<mempo of likato> to see instead of a much niver face mask like enshrouded veil or others of our choice. <br><br>Sharun 57 monk fennin Ro ]</i></font><br><br>The ring is on the list of things to look into. The team is aware of it. I don't know about the mask. I'll let them know.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000067.html"><b>Roleplaying</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Since Roleplaying is such a hot topic right now, and since the love depth of the story, yet all the plot holes in the history of Norrath bug me... why not add more books with Norrath history in them in hard to find places in Norrath. Like how about some information on Past Heroes of Norrath. Or how Mistmoore relates into the Kunark/Faydwer relationship. Why does Mistmoore like it when you hunt in Howling Stones for example. Or The storyline of Dar brood of dragons... Or some information on the exile of Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen from the Claws of Veeshan. I mean when I say put these books of lore in hard to find places.. I mean anywhere from a vendor in Yelinak's Lair for Information on Dragons, to a new spawn in Crushbone that drops a book telling the history of the Crushbone Orcs. Also how did Frogloks become some of the richest creatures in Norrath? I think if the storyline was developed a bit more people whould find it easier to get into that roleplaying mood. <br><br>Laurana Highwind<br>58 Knight of Tunare<br>Crusaders of Plilo<br>Zeb Server ]</i></font><br><br>I completely agree. I would love to see more things like this in game. The idea that someone could find an old musty tome and discover that it's Mayong Mistmoore's diary, kept up until the day he, um, died is pretty interesting. I'll most certainly plant the seed and see if it grows. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000068.html"><b>New Servers</b></a><br>I'm not trying to single you out by responding to you this way. But I wanted to point out that we announce new servers as soon as we know that we're putting them up. I've been getting a lot of questions like yours, and I just wanted to let everyone know that we're not sneaking new servers in the back door. And prodding me with sharp objects, while fun, won't divulge any secret information about new servers. <br><br>When we've got one in the planning, we'll certainly let you know. I'll post it here. <br><br>And, well, I certainly hope that EverQuest Classic causes us to need more servers. That's what the marketing folks tell me is the idea of the whole thing. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000074.html"><b>Fan Fair</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: How are the preparations comming?? I'm heading down there early tomorrow morning (driving from Sacramento) and was curious how things were going. Also curious if it was known who (among Verant employees) was attending? Thanks! See ya soon. =) <br><br>- Mahkahl ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I sort of ducked out of any responsibility for helping to set up on this one. <br><br>/em looks sheepish. <br><br>I've been really busy with the new setup, so I haven't really peeked into how it's going. But I do know that a whole lot of us will be there. It's in our town, so that makes it very convenient. <br><br>I thought I'd take this chance to plug the event and to say that a lot of fun will be had by all. I'll see you there.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000075.html"><b>Foraging Improvements</b></a><br>Mshort wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: Little error on frontpage message <br><br>On the front website page, you have: <br><br>Skill Change <br><br>- Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, your next successful forage will always be drink or food. We have also decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and increased the chance that you will forage water. <br><br>Unfortunately, this reads that if I get a "hungry" message, my next successful forage will be a "drink". Doesn't sound like a positive change. <br><br>You might want to change it to, "[....] if are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, your next successful forage will always be food or drink." <br><br>BTW, nice change lowering the foraged grubs. I always seemed to get twice as many of those than anything else. Really useless since I never <br>worked up the fishing skill (didn't need it -- i could forage!) <br>thanks! ]</i></font><br><br>That's what was in the patch message. Yes, it could be clearer (we've had several e-mails like yours). I'll send a message to the web team, and I'll make it clearer here. <br><br>When you are hungry you will forage food on a successful foraging attempt. <br><br>When you are thirsty you will forage something to drink. <br><br>Sorry for being a bit vague.</UL>
