The idea of making running the default movement was tackled recently in a recent post that Sony/Verant's Gordon Wrinn made.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058870.html">the thread</a>:<UL>Why do we even have the option to walk? Everyone agrees that the toggle should be set to RUN as a default, but why do we even have the option to move at a slower speed?<br>Ok, some diehard RPers out there switch to walk and put their weapons away when they enter a town, but 99% or more of us don't care whether our weapons are out when we are in town.<br><br>It makes autofollow easier if the leader is walking, especially in strange, tree filled terrain.<br><br>but these, in my opinion, do not even justify the ability to walk, let alone have it as the default. However I do concede that my first reason why people would use walk fits with the vision so I dont see Verant removing the ability to walk anytime soon. But it is time to finally implement the change that sets the default to RUN, quick, before they have a final version of the new client.<br><br><b><i>We're still clinging to the idea that people might decide to walk from time to time as a matter of roleplay, hence, your character walks until it *decides* to run. Is it really that difficult to hit a few buttons when logging on?<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

How do NPCs see through illusions and can tell what deity you worship?

Gordon Wrinn responded to a post centered on accusations that Verant has has made a change to Pumice.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059335.html">original post followed by the response</a>:<UL>I realize that the "pumice" change may have been a "vision" move, however, where's the official statement about it?<br><br>This is a HUUUUGE change. Every caster class gets "Cancel Magic" which they can cast on themselves even when blinded, rooted, snared, etc. Plus they have the ability, ALL the casting classes, to slow us melee only down in some way.<br><br>Why is this fair to nerf the pumice stone? Maybe a 1 second casting time, but 4.5? They can stack new dots on me faster than I could pumice them off! They can resnare before I even get thru taking the 2nd dot off me!<br><br>Come on now!<br><br><b><i>There wasn't supposed to be an official announcement before-hand. The existing item wasn't changed, but rather, the vendors just sell a different item now. The original pumice stone is still in game, and in fact, drops someplace as loot now.<br><br>That said, I'm assuming you want to know why it was done. Frankly, purchased items should generally not be more efficient than casting the spell yourself or getting someone else to cast it upon you. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

I spotted a new reply Gordon posted on a thread titled <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059032.html">The Source of Verant's Problems</a> on the Gameplay Board.  Here are excerpts from the original post along with Gordon's response:<UL>Now Abashi has stated that rogues are "the necromancers of melee" and later clarified that he means that they are on the upper end of the balance scale, which would seem to indicate that he considers necromancers to be nearly perfectly balanced<br><br><b><i>Actually, no. I would consider necromancers to be "on the virge of being overpowered". By "overpowered" I do not speak of pure offensive power, but everything that makes up a class that figures into the balance equation. "Perfectly balanced" lies somewhere between "overpowered" and "underpowered" in this sense. <br><br>By saying that rogues are the "necros of melee", I was not speaking of versitility nor solo capability, but rather that rogues are on the virge of being overpowered every bit as much as necros are. The original vision for rogues was more of a "thief" than they are now. However inability to fully implement some of the skills we had planned (sense/disarm traps), we decided to fit them more into an "assassin" role. </b></i><br><br>Now since they could not fit Verant's niche monks invented a new, valuable and effective niche for themselves and became EQ's master pullers, bringing themselves back into balance with the EQ's environment<br><br><b><i>I've taken quite a bit of heat from some players about some comments that I made about not liking feign-pulling. Quite simply, when feign-pulling, a monk uses a skill that we created for something other than its purpose. Feign Death was supposed to be an escape skill, not a skill that allowed easier breaking of camps. Also consider that feign-pulling doesn't make sense from a roleplay perspective (we like it when things make sense in this fashion). Can you see a creature saying, "I'M MAD AT HIM, I'M GOING TO KI...wait... he's dead now.. I guess I'll go ba...AH HA! HE'S NOT DEAD, I'M GOING TO KI...wait...no... dead again....(ad nauseam)" </b></i><br><br>Verant needs to realize that they have not created the perfect gaming environment, and therefore need to alter their perception of some of the classes and bring them in line with the world they have created, not the world they had envisioned. <br><br><b><i>We're well aware that the game isn't perfect. Afterall, what game can be? That said, what good would we do as game designers if we did not have some idea for the way we wanted the game. People will continue to make the decision as to whether the game we offer is one that they are willing to play. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059066.html">the thread</a>:<UL>The hybrid experience penalty<br><br>1. Based on your statements hybrids receive more experience than group members for the same kill due to their experience penalties.<br><br>2. Based on your statements you lose experience based on your total experience points at the time.<br>Therefore logically you go by a percentage of your total experience. If this is true a lvl 60 half elf ranger who has about 55% more experience as a lvl 60 halfing warrior (about 780 million Vs about 430 million - dont have exact figures in front of me) would lose more experience between the two. <br><br>3. Upon Res the half elf ranger would receive numerically more exp points back but would still have lost (numerically) more experience and therefore is basically penalized twice upon death.<br><br>So, therefore, a hybrid who has to make more experience in the first place for the same lvl also loses more experience when he dies.<br><br>Tell me my logic is flawed Abashi<br><br>If it is flawed tell me where please<br><br><i><b>It's flawed :)<br><br>Everyone of a given level loses the same amount (numerically) of experience at death. As a percentage of total experience, the race/class combos that require less experience to level lose comparativly move experience on death than those who take more to level.<br><br>-Gordon</i></b></UL>

The northern fringe of Ro<br>has been chosen as the perfect ground for this Wild Hunt! Those who are<br>willing to embrace our bloody ways should look for Radharc at Neriak's<br>entrance, or Moruviell at Freeport's south gate.

Gordon Wrinn responded to a post today on a question a player raised about the upcoming Bertoxxulous and Karana server split.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057573.html">the original post followed by Gordon's response</a>:<UL>Gordon:<br><br>In the past, server splits have always had a limit on them. The split starts at some time in the US, and then the disclaimer message says that only the first xxxx will get through, and tough luck for the others. Well this discourages many people from moving, because their friends might all make it to the split, but that person could get left behind. And the GM would just say "tough luck". Being left behind by your friends is the worst thing that could happen in this game. Nobody wants this to happen.<br><br>Since this is Bertoxx's 2nd split, can you assure us that anyone who does /movelog will get moved, and if they do not, that they can petition for a move?<br><br><I><B>Though I appreciate your concerns, we couldn't realistically "guarantee" that everyone who registers once we open registration will be moved. For instance, if everyone, however unlikely, registered to be moved, we wouldn't be able to move everyone.<br> <br>The discouragement that you speak of is about the only thing that keeps the number of people to be moved reasonable. Like always, we'll make every effort to provide the best customer-service possible. <br><br>-Gordon</I></B></UL>

Written by Graack, this article explores several EverQuest issues in-depth that the author feels Verant should work on.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Verant has repeatedly asked it's players to use the /feedback command to <br>give their opinion of the game and certain issues that arise. This would <br>allow Verant to have an inclination how of the players of EverQuest feel. <br>However, again, I feel that the feedback-logs are allowed to fill to such a <br>capacity that many feedbacks are lost without having ever been examined.<br><br>Indeed, I have often seen GW post about various issues on how he sees the <br>people who post on the web-boards as representing the minority of players. <br>And yet, he has a very valuable tool in finding the pulse of the majority <br>that he allows to go unused, and wasted.</UL>Enjoy!

A new story entitled <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid962587572,46212,">Aislein</a> was published today in our <a href="/lore/stories">Fan Fiction</a> archive.  Here's an excerpt from this tale written by Steven M. Hackett:<UL><i>Just then, a familiar snuffling sound attracted his attention. Withholding the urge to panic, Daylan dove into a nearby bush, holding perfectly still to camouflage his presence. As soon as he was settled, the five orcs came lumbering out of the trees, snorting and pounding one another upon the back, congratulating each other on some marvelous deed. Their blood red eyes were glowing wit a malicious form of energy and Daylan shuddered unconsciously wen an orc glowered in his direction. He had a new reason to fear these grotesque creatures now. He had been disgusted by their actions earlier, just as he would have been had he stumbled upon the carnage left by a pack of wolves. But now that he saw that they were sentient creatures, he was filled with rage. Not only did they realize they were committing heinous crimes against the peaceful farmers, but they were actually enjoying it! Yet, even this newest realization didn&#8217;t prepare him for the orc&#8217;s reaction when they emerged from the thick canopy and felt the rain beating down upon them. <br><br>        The orcs went berserk. As one, the foul creatures raised their faces to the sky and began to howl. It was a cry of defiance raised towards Karana for sending the offensive precipitation. Their battle cry sounded, the pack darted out into the downpour, heading directly towards the still-burning farmhouse. For a brief instant, Daylan considered unloading his arrow into one of the orcs&#8217; backs to distract them from his father, but he decided it would be unwise to incur the wrath of the Crushbone pack. He was not particularly proud of his decision since in emphasized his terror of the orcs, but he firmly reminded himself that his father was a ranger. Larwyn could take care of himself without his son running the risk of getting killed. Besides, Daylan had his own assignment, though he had a dreadful suspicion as to what he would find in the depths of Faydark.</i></UL>Enjoy!

I think a couple of points<br>needs to be elaborated, however, so I am taking another stab at this.<br><br>Granted, not having a base of operations on a harsh continent like Kunark<br>must really make some players angry, especially after working through a<br>long dungeon crawl only to return to a city in which you formerly had<br>favored citizen status and end up slaughtered. It would make me angry. On<br>the other hand, much of EQ is trial by fire, and it's meant to be that way.</UL>Enjoy!

Gordon made a big announcement this morning on the Gameplay Board regarding new changes coming to EverQuest.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058462.html">the post</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>I thought I'd drop a line and let everyone know about some exciting changes that we are working on:<br><br>First, the next EQ client will, unless a problem is discovered in testing, include a slash-command that will allow players to turn off display of corpses. This will be a client-side option that will just repress the rendering of the corpses themselves. This will allow corpse-related actions (like sense-corpse) to be taken even while corpse display is repressed. <br><br>The command (/hidecorpses) will have three possible parameters:<br><br>None - Shows all corpses<br>All - Hides all corpses but that belonging to the player.<br>All but group - Hides all corpses but those belonging to the player and group members.<br><br>As asking people "Has anyone seen my corpse?" is an issue that we feel builds the feeling of community and encourages people to help each other out, the command will reset to showing all corpses upon zoning. Also, as a note, in its current implementation, any corpses created after the command is run will be shown. <br><br>This command should help people who experience framerate problems after zoning in to areas known to cause a large number of corpses. <br><br>The second change has to do with quested keys for entrance into the keyed dungeons on Kunark: Sebilis, Charasis, and Veeshan's Peak. It's apparent that the risk of dying in these zones is too great to risk going with only one key. Furthermore, it's become standard practice for people to leave a corpse at the entrance of these dungeons with the spare key.<br><br>As we feel that the idea of dueling and getting killed just to leave a corpse for a bank isn't in the best intrest of roleplaying or our vision for the game (e.g. It's cheesy), we've decided to nerf this practice  Our plan is to have keys for these three dungeons stay with the owner when they return to their bind point. This new ability that we are working on also gives us the opportunity to explore "soulbound" items in the future, but no promises just yet on that.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Gordon made a second post in this thread clearing up an issue one of the players had with his original post:<UL>that when you die in sebelis that the key to sebelis (and charlis, and howling) will stay with<br>you? That way only one key is needed?<br><br><b><i>Judging by the responses, I apparently didn't explain it very well.<br><br>When you die, instead of appearing at your bind point naked, you'll appear there with your key. So yes, only one key would be needed, and there'd be no reason to kill yourself off outside the dungeon to hold your key.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

An event announcement was sent to me by Eric:<BLOCKQUOTE>I will be running a GM type quest with pretty good loot as rewards for those<br>who complete it in the given time period.  This is just a test to see if<br>there is an interest in this type of thing, and depending on the outcome of<br>it, I may run others in the near future.  This quest will have no entry fee,<br>but for me to boost the quality level of the items I will probably charge a<br>nominal fee per person/party that joins if this continues beyond the test<br>run.  If you aren&#8217;t interested in role-playing and would prefer not to take<br>part in this, there is no need to read any further.  For those of you who<br>would like a break from the hum drum beating on mobs in the eternal search<br>for that next level, please read on.  Also, for anyone who has problems with<br>me using Freeport as the city name and Lucan as the boss, please forgive me.<br>It is a must though because using the word &#8220;city&#8221; and labeling the guards as<br>he/she/they throughout the tale would have lost a lot.  This is however open<br>to any race though some may find it more difficult than others:<br><br>You feel as though your lungs will burst if you take another step, but<br>fearing your pursuers are still on your tracks you dare not rest.  How could<br>this have happened to you?  Once a respected citizen of Freeport, your name<br>has been disgraced and your own city has turned on you.  As you escape the<br>boundaries of the city and look around you, you see that the guards dare not<br>pursue you further.  Gasping for breath you think back&#8230;<br><br>Just two nights ago while enjoying a healthy cup of mead you were approached<br>by a sinewy man that claimed that he knew you.  Having had perhaps a bit too<br>much ale, you humored the rather sly looking creature and asked him if it<br>was your fame or you good looks that he had heard about.  Apparently not<br>getting the joke, he came closer and said, &#8220;You are the one.  The one that<br>was foretold.&#8221; He spat at your feet and walked off, but turned with a<br>menacing glare and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t think you can live out your prophecy, for I<br>know your heart well and will see you burned before I allow you to destroy<br>us!&#8221; then disappeared into the darkness of the night.  You shared a laugh<br>with the bartender and asked what the mad man was having because you could<br>use a cup or two&#8230;<br><br>The encounter seemed odd, but hardly worth wasting one&#8217;s time contemplating<br>as angry and bitter people frequent bars as much as hardy adventurers.  One<br>deluded soul was unlikely to be the turn of your fate and he was as likely<br>as not passed out in a ditch somewhere by now anyway.  Sadly, you could not<br>have been more wrong&#8230;<br><br>As you left the bar severely intoxicated, you were greeted by the local<br>militia.  &#8220;Stop right where you are,&#8221; one of the guards demanded.  Being in<br>no shape to argue you froze.  &#8220;Is this the man that you saw?&#8221;<br><br>A voice you have never heard before but that made your skin crawl to listen<br>to it stated, &#8220;Yes, he is the one.  Arrest him before he brings anymore harm<br>to the people of this town!&#8221;  With that you began to feel the world shift<br>underneath you as you were grabbed, thrown around, beaten, and finally taken<br>into custody.  As you awoke the next day you could hear the screams of those<br>who had been placed in the &#8220;care&#8221; of the Freeport militia before you.  Still<br>a bit hazy from the night before you screamed for a guard&#8230;.  No response.<br>Laying back against your cell door a bit exhausted and for some reason in<br>pain, you drifted off again.<br><br>TAP TAP TAP<br><br>Awakened with a start, you found a guard bouncing the flat of his sword<br>against your head to get you off the bars, &#8220;Listen up prisoner&#8230;  I<br>personally thought we should have killed you for what you have done when we<br>found you, so get out of the reach of my sword before it slips and hurts<br>someone!  We don&#8217;t take kindly to kidnappers here.  Tomorrow when Lucan<br>holds your trial, you can expect to meet with swift punishment, so you<br>better enjoy this fine cuisine like it was your last!&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Kidnapping?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Heh, yeah your damn right.  Kidnapping the child was worth slaying you<br>over, but executing the rest of the household will insure that you hang.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Wait, but I didn&#8217;t do anything!&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yeah, yeah&#8230;  That&#8217;s what they all say.  If I had a copper for every time I<br>heard that line I wouldn&#8217;t be working here!  Sweet dreams kidnapper.  Take<br>whatever spiritual precautions you feel the need to now, because in the<br>mornin&#8217;, you&#8217;re going to meet justice.&#8221;<br><br>The night came and went, but this time it wasn&#8217;t spent passed out or in a<br>stupor.  By daybreak you had filed away the bars and were well on your way<br>out of the city.  Such things as missing bars seem not to have gone<br>unnoticed though as you picked up a large train of pursuers and barely made<br>it out with your life.  Thus you have ended up here&#8230;<br><br>While your life is safe for now, your name has been destroyed.  But by who?<br>And what would they stand to gain by destroying you?  Could this all have<br>been coincidence?  That seems very doubtful.  Clearly someone has made an<br>attempt on your life, and the only way to meet such an assault is with the<br>proper defense of your name and deeds.<br><br>Where shall you begin this trek though?  Freeport is not open to you and<br>would likely cost you your head if you returned.  Perhaps sending another to<br>scout out the information&#8230;  No, this is your fight and you don&#8217;t need to<br>bring anyone else down this dark road.  There is one who would be able to<br>help&#8230;  A sagely monk by the name of Cheng Meng&#8217;te is known to reside deep to<br>the south beyond Oggok and perhaps he would be able to see with his<br>clairvoyance who the cause of this great evil against you was.  With that,<br>you set out determined to bring your name justice, and to slay those that<br>would attempt to have you slain you no matter the cost!<br><br>When:  Friday, July 7 at 8:00 PM EST is when this quest will begin and it<br>will last until Sunday 8:00 PM that same weekend.<br><br>Where:  E&#8217;ci West Freeport near the wagons/vendors is where the quest will<br>begin but you may find that the travel involved in completing this quest is<br>in abundance.  Don&#8217;t worry, at no point will I hand you a note and tell you<br>to take it to the Bard&#8217;s guild in such and such zone, so this is NOT like a<br>regular EQ quest.<br><br>Who:  You are allowed to do this quest with 1 &#8211; 5 players.  Please, no more<br>than 5 as depending on how far into the quest you get it may require that I<br>add one of my own characters or a friend&#8217;s into your group.<br><br>Cost:  NOTHING but your time.  There are prizes along the way, and prizes<br>for finishing the quest, but all I ask of you is that you enjoy the ride.<br><br>Requirements:  Evil races will run into a bit of a problem with a few of the<br>encounters and may want to bring a high level friend or two to help defend<br>them from beatings.  Be prepared to duel.  Almost all combat involved in<br>this quest will involve other PCs and for that reason when one prompts any<br>member of your group with a /duel you must accept it.  No waiting around for<br>buffs, no healing up before you accept.  You should have done those prior to<br>the encounter.  If you at any point find the urge striking you to /duel<br>someone, feel free to.  These characters for the sake of this quest are NPCs<br>and if you prompt to attack them, then they will accept and the battle will<br>proceed from there.<br><br>Rewards:  Rewards are based on a few things.  The primary deciding factor is<br>how far you get in the quest.  Some will not reach the objectives at all,<br>some will complete a portion of it and assume they are done, and others will<br>complete the whole quest.  All I can suggest for completing this quest is BE<br>ALERT.  It isn&#8217;t over until the fat lady sings.  You will receive rewards at<br>the end of the quest based on the speed with which you accomplish it, and<br>the fun that you provided along the way.  Role-play if you want to get<br>anywhere.<br><br>Registration:  Please inform me ahead of time if you are interested and we<br>will prepare for you.  All registry will actually take place at the actual<br>meeting place in West Freeport on Friday though and at that point you will<br>give me a group name (doesn&#8217;t have to be creative.  Could be group X for all<br>I care) and a group leader which will actually be the person the above story<br>describes and thus the person that the entire quest revolves around.  If you<br>choose to go solo, that is OK as well, but you will still need a group name<br>for referencing you when you reach certain spots.<br><br>NOTIFICATION:  I know that only a small percentage of the population of E&#8217;ci<br>reads this board, so please notify your friends if you have any that are<br>interested in this sort of adventure.  NOBODY at any point should share<br>information with other groups as YOU are the one on this quest and all other<br>groups are not any of your concern since as far as your group is concerned<br>you are the only ones involved here.  I know that it will be hard, but share<br>all your tales about it at 8:00 on Sunday rather than during the actual<br>campaign.  If you have any questions, contact me in private messages here,<br>or in /tells in the game.<br><br>Thanks for reading this lengthy post and for those of you who do take part,<br>I hope you like it.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
