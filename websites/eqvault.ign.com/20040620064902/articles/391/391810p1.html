<span class=dateline>September 04, 1999</span> - &#8220;Neriak is an enigma. Finding opportunity in the home of the Teir&#8217;dal is simple. Everyone has a hidden agenda, and a need for covert aid. But one must tread carefully there, because the motives of the dark elves often involve disposal of the ally in question.&#8221; 
-From Shades of Gray, the memoirs of Modus Operandi 
Catalyst sat in his black stone room, on a hard bed. Through his slit-like windows, the purple glow of Neriak seeped in, just barely. He stared, silent. Catalyst was Teir&#8217;dal, a dark elf. But he was not born of their community, such as it was. Catalyst was owned, much like the goblin slaves, even if never abused. House Zu&#8217;karr claimed him, but never graced him with a real name. Burning in a distant somewhere, he felt rage for that. But it was muted, somehow absent from the now. All that remained in his head was the music, the dark music. It had always been there, an unending farewell song for whatever was lost to him. 
Two days ago, he had been told why House Zu&#8217;karr bothered to support him. His holder, Aniyal, revealed to him that he would be the agent of change for Neriak, the gamble that would conquer the surface world. She had whispered in his ear that he would become the scourge of hundreds, perhaps thousands of elves. And she had hinted at a reward - the ultimate reward. An identity. 
Catalyst stood, disgusted. He knew she was tempting him for no reason other than simple cruelty. Aniyal never brought happiness. She was a torturer, and Catalyst was her toy. At her orders, he had done&#8230; unspeakable things to captured prisoners. He was compelled from within. 
Once, he tried to resist. Not out of pity - Catalyst never felt anything for anyone. But he wanted a will of his own, so he had attempted to stand against her. Aniyal had actually smiled. Her hand made the slightest of movements, and he was wracked from within. It felt as if she was literally stripping at his life with her sharpened fingernails. He had vomited and convulsed for the better part of an hour. Aniyal stood, watching and smiling, the entire time. By the time it was over, Catalyst had begged to resume the mutilation of her astonished victim. 
He didn&#8217;t understand the hold she had on him. His few attempts to discern his origins had met with tight lips and enigmatic, condescending smiles from the other Zu&#8217;karr nobles. But he was, perhaps, more a slave than those that toiled in the mines below. He couldn&#8217;t even take his own life with a heavy pick or a leap from a chasm, like the workers often did. Whenever he brought one of his blades close to his neck or wrists, the twisting began again, and he was forced to the ground. 
A sharp clack of the iron doorknocker outside. Echoes. He waited a moment, and then came the voice. 
&#8220;It is I, my manse&#8217;toru. Open your door to me. I know you understand the consequences of further delay.&#8221; 
There it was. Her voice, like a silken scarf on a stiletto. It hissed, it soothed, it threatened. Catalyst opened the door, less than willingly. Aniyal stood there, with her beautiful, insidious smile. She was so cold, appraising him like a jewel or a weapon. He grunted. 
&#8220;It is time, pet. The moment of your enlightenment is at hand. You will at last be taught what you are the catalyst of,&#8221; she stated, and smiled as if he should thank her. 
&#8220;Yes, my mistress,&#8221; Catalyst muttered. The words were ripped from him. Without a word, Aniyal turned on her heel and walked elegantly down the marble hall. As the echoes from her footsteps deepened, Catalyst sighed and then left his room to follow her. He knew the price of disobedience. 
He walked with Aniyal through the upper chambers in a daze, barely aware of his surroundings, and certainly without any interest. Soon however, his bones chilled as he realized that they approached the entrance to the kaisa, the house dungeon. Marble walls became rough granite as the stairs spiraled down, down, down. Into the blackness. 
All Teir&#8217;dal elves could see in even the deepest shadow, but something about the kaisa made it claustrophobic and forever concealing. It was as if the constant pain inflicted here created a kind of sinister fog. Catalyst hugged his arms about himself, and followed Aniyal carefully, now. The priestess did not even shiver. He was sure she was enjoying his reaction. The silence of the halls above had melded, seamlessly, into the screams of the prisoners. The wailing of the damned. Catalyst tried to block it out, to little avail. The shrieks even drowned out the somber melody in his head, and that scared him. 
Soon, they approached a worked-mithril door. Aniyal stopped, and turned to face him. 
&#8220;Come, Catalyst. Let me proudly introduce you to your destiny,&#8221; she purred. With another of her horrible, alluring smiles, she turned and traced a pattern on the door. Her elegant blue-black hands whipped around the engraved work on the mighty portal, and an audible click resounded in the hall. To Catalyst&#8217;s surprise, a secreted door swung silently open in the stone wall nearby. The mithril door did not budge. 
&#8220;Appearances can be deceiving in the kaisa,&#8221; Aniyal murmured. Catalyst merely nodded, and followed her into the revealed chamber. Once inside, he froze, gaping. The circular room was far larger than he would have imagined, and ten crimson-robed Teir&#8217;dal stood, facing him. The symbol of Zu&#8217;karr was embroidered in black upon their vestments, and their eyes bored into him. He knew that look. He was manse&#8217;toru, a tool which has yet to be used. 
But it was the room&#8217;s centerpiece that had him staring in horror. On a long, crooked bed of metal lay what looked like an eviscerated dwarf. All its tendons were strung to hooks on the outer rim of the grim table, and the belly was open to the ceiling. But it moved. Somehow, the poor creature was still alive. The head was covered in a hood of black silk, but the eyes showed clearly his agony and rage. 
The clerics, in their robes of blood red, began to move toward Catalyst. Numbed, he was distantly aware of their hands gripping him from many angles, surging him toward the mutilated dwarf. He was being connected to some sort of harness, hanging limply above the table. From somewhere he could not discern, Aniyal appeared, carrying a tall, smoked-glass jar. 
&#8220;This is a phylactery, my manse&#8217;toru. Do you see what lives inside? It is you,&#8221; she chuckled, holding the object close for him to see. Inside, a twisting band of blue energy raged and splashed against the walls of its prison. Catalyst could feel it there, wanting to be free. It was him. He was close enough now to feel the rage and pain and love and hate and - 
&#8220;This is your essence, child. You were separated from it a long while ago, when you came into our care. It adorns our sacred temple now; a decoration of sorts. It is a symbol of what you are, and what you will be. It is time for your use to become clear, soulless one.&#8221; Aniyal took the jar away, and once again Catalyst felt the loss, heard the funeral melody in his skull. Everything was gray&#8230; 
The hands across his back pushed him down close, eye-to-eye with the dwarf. The butchered figure began to convulse. The black silk mask became a blur as its head whipped back and forth wildly, inhumanly fast. Soon, a sound poured forth from its lips. It was like a hundred thousand banshees screaming in rage, all in unison. Somehow, in the midst of the shimmering image, Catalyst could still see its eyes. Terrible, terrible eyes. The Hatred in the chamber was tangible. You could smell it. 
The mask snapped free. Blood from the bruises and cuts beneath slung haphazardly about, as the unearthly seizure continued. The scream built, until all the priests in the room covered their ears to block it out. Despite the fact that he now hung free over the table, Catalyst could not move. The howl kept him rooted in place. 
A bright white poured forth from the torn face of the dwarf below him, and filled his mind. Bands of electric prime energy snaked all about him, as the unholy transfer began. Catalyst was being force-fed someone else&#8217;s tortured soul, and he could feel it all, clearly. Every muscle strained, every bone popped, every tendon stretched. Catalyst blinked. 
My forefathers, my people, my kin shall be avenged! 
The Mairil Elder stood before him on the hill - betrayer, betrayer, betrayer - The High Elf. His people were being torn apart, but the Elf stood and watched. The bastard could call upon the Elven legions to aid us, but he stood and watched. The Teir&#8217;dal were everywhere, cutting his dwarves apart like lambs, but the Elf stood and watched. The blood of his kindred - 
We shall be avenged! Hate! Hate! Hate! 
Vengeance! 
Catalyst blinked. 
One dwarf alone. He stood in front of every elf, all elves. Axe in hand, axe in hand. Killing blade under his fingers. He stood before every elf, axe in hand, and - 
He would stand before every elf, axe in hand and - 
Catalyst blinked. With a final spasm, he collapsed onto the bloodied, tortured dwarf. Somehow his bonds had snapped. He heard the rattle of long-overdue death in the throat of the poor creature under him. The clerics stood all around the table, watching his every twitch. He lurched off the table, and vomited. His head spun, and he held his hands to his face. Something had changed. The music was gone, the twilight music. The emptiness was filled somehow, and the loss abated. 
In its place was something else. <div class=byline>-- Jordan Thomas</div></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
