Alan had a busy day on the forums.  Here's the latest from him:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042002.html"><b>Having Three Bags Open at Once</b></a><br>Unfortunately, and oddly enough, it's not likely that we'll be able to make it so that you can open more than two bags. Rowyl already answered this, and essentially it's a programming nightmare. Obviously anything can be done with enough work, but this one isn't likely to happen. With the time required to change it, Rowyl could probably raise the Titanic&#8230; :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041958.html"><b>Ayonae Ro</b></a><br>Ayonae Ro is the ruler of the Realm of Music. <br><br>Don't you dare ask me to pronounce the name. I still officially mis-pronounce Tanarus...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041986.html"><b>On Enchanter Illusions</b></a><br>Pretty much, no. <br><br>There is as near to no chance that enchanters will ever be getting any spell that increases their foot speed as you could imagine. This is one of those signature abilities for other classes that we are very reluctant to give to other classes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041494-2.html"><b>Lure Spells</b></a><br>Monoriu wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:&#8221;What is the effectiveness of my lure spells after tonights patch, as compared to, say, 2 months ago? <br>A simple answer will do. <br><br>Also, I strongly suggest that you change your name to blue. This will increase your credibility 100 fold. <br><br>Thanks&#8221; ]></i></font><br><br>Well, he doesn&#8217;t post much, so that&#8217;s probably why his name is not blue. I can get that fixed if he plans to post more. Uzun is the server-side programmer. Basically, if anyone knows how this thing works, he's the guy. What happened was that Gordon and Roger talked it over, and it seems that Gordon made an error. <br><br>I messed up my own password yesterday and haven&#8217;t been able to post (in fact, I&#8217;m typing a bunch of replies to post when I get it fixed.) <br><br>It will be the same as it is now. This patch will make no changes to Lure. <br><br>But about three weeks ago monster saves were changed somewhat, so that they would resist the right kinds of Lures the right way. So, perhaps a fire breathing foe will now resist fire Lures a bit better. But it&#8217;s resistance to cold Lures wouldn&#8217;t have changed. The idea is, now you actually have to use the right Lure on certain monsters... <br><br>And that change was made a few weeks ago. There will be no change with this current patch. <br><br>I probably should have figured this out earlier and let you all know. But I was having trouble understanding the change. The lack of notification is primarily my fault. I&#8217;m sorry.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041855.html"><b>Items Nerfed</b></a><br>Gravedirt wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "VI should NEVER had put these effects on these items in the first place, they'd have saved themselves a LOT of grief at this point."]></i></font> <br><br>That's pretty much the truth of it. <br><br>Some of the items that we've given right-click effects are too powerful. This breastplate was one of them. I find it a bit surprising that most of you are suggesting that it was not too powerful. <br><br>I'm sorry that we had to change the casting time on it. But the item was plainly overpowered, and it needed to be changed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041951.html"><b>Verant Let Too Many Switch Servers?</b></a><br>You can create characters on the new server. I just did... :)<br><br>New servers always have a huge spike in population, no matter if they are split of fresh.

There were six or seven of us in the room when that conversation was going on, so I can see how Lum might have confused that. I gotta make sure you give credit where it's due.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041473.html"><b>"Did Verant hire a South Park artist?"</b></a><br>Oddly enough, I think a saw someone working on that animation recently... <br><br>Though I disagree about the graphic, I think the direwolf looks awesome.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041484.html"><b>EverQuest.com Poll</b></a><br>Absolutely, positively, just a poll. <br><br>I don&#8217;t think anyone on the dev team is even aware that there is a poll...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040590-3.html"><b>Shaman & Locked Threads</b></a><br>Piercey wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "A.the topic is under discussion and being looked at;or B.for reasons of balance/gameplay etc We do not feel an adjustment to to the Shaman pet is warranted."]></i></font> <br><br>To sum this up in short order, the answer is both A and B. <br><br>I asked about this pet at the last tuning meeting. We talked about it a bit (it was an old issue to everyone, but they went over the discussion again). And it was, again, decided that the pet is pretty much how it was intended to be. It's a very mild upgrade to the previous pet, and some will still use the old one. And that seems to be how it will remain. <br><br>I'll try to tackle the other Shaman concerns tomorrow.

Alan summed up the situation with Lure spells in the following <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041945.html">message he posted</a> on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>I just wanted to summarize what is happening and what has happened with Lure spells (hopefully I understand it).<br><br>Three weeks ago, the resist rates for NPCs in regards to Lure was fixed. This means, basically, that they will resist Lures that they are supposed to resists (a fire creature might now resist a fire-based Lure that it did not resist before). This change really shouldn't have affected most wizards, once they realized the change and adjusted tactics accordingly. It is my fault for not informing you of the change. For that I'm sorry.<br><br>However, all the talk about changes to this line of spells brought about a more in-depth look at how they work, leading to this post by one of our programmers (given in full here for your enjoyment):<br><br>"After looking closely at the way saves are done when the target is higher level than the caster, it appears that Lures would get saving throws in situations where they should not. I'm fixing it now, it should go on test shortly. <br><br>So to make everyone happy, the target of a lure spell will NOT get a saving throw addition if it's higher level than the caster. I thought this already was the case, it was not. <br><br>Currently on live some NPCs are getting saves versus lures that they should not be getting."<br><br>This change, however, will not take effect until we patch next. With the holidays on us, it's hard to tell when that will be.<br><br>So, over all, Lure should actually become a more powerful line of spells, for those that are fully aware of their proper use&#8230;<br><br>Alan</I></UL>

Verant's Unzun <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041494.html">made an announcement</a> concerning the Lure series of spells on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>There is a nasty rumour floating around that something will be changed in the overall way that NPCs save against the Lure series of spells this upcoming patch. This is NOT true. Lure saves at one time were SUPPOSED to be like lifetap saves, but this did not happen. They are currently more like Dragon Breath saves, which is better for the caster, worse for the target. They will CONTINUE to be that way!<br>About 3 weeks ago dragon breath saves were adjusted, and that resulted in some few NPCS saving SLIGHTLY better saves vs certain lures, but this change happened about a month ago on test, 3 weeks ago on live, and lures will continue to work as dragon breath type saves, that will not change.<br><br>In an irc chat it was incorrectly stated, that Lures would be treated as lifetap saves, let me repeat, this is NOT true. Lures are treated as Dragon breath type saves both before and after tonights patch.</i></UL>

Along with Patch Day comes a new Patch Message and today is no exception:<UL>December 19th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch primarily consists of tuning of Velious zones as well as content and other additions.  In addition, the following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<br><br>- High-end items that have a activatable (right-click) healing effect have in several cases had their casting times increased.  <br>- Factions for some of the higher end encounters in Velious have received some adjustments.  Basically, "bad acts" receive more weight than "good acts".  For instance, if "A" hates "B" and "B" hates "A", killing "A" will hurt your faction with "A" more than it will help your faction with "B".<br>- The stamina reduction with "Resurrection Effects" has been replaced by a slight attack-speed debuff.<br>- The Ranger's Trueshot discipline now works correctly.  It was previously only working versus other player characters.<br>- The Shadow Knight's "Unholy Aura" discipline has received an enhancement.  When in use, harmtouch resistances will be checked versus disease instead of magic.  In addition, harmtouch will resist in the same fashion as lifetap spells, meaning that unless the creature is immune to disease, you should get full damage most of the time.<br>- The spell attached to the "Fiery Defender" can now be partially resisted instead of being "all or nothing".  The net result is that the average damage will be higher.<br>- The Paladin "Holy Forge" discipline will now give paladins triple the normal chance of scoring a critical hit.  Each critical hit has a percent chance to be scored as a critical blow.<br>- Added parameters to the /camp command (the command that will cause you to camp out if you are already sitting).  "/camp server" will take you back to the server selection screen.  "/camp desktop" will take you out to the desktop following a successful camp.  Despite popular request, "/camp spawn" will not be implemented.<br>- Walruses now indeed sound like they should.<br>- Added the /chatfontsize [0 to 5] (default is 1) command.  This command will allow players to adjust the size of the font in the chat window.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

While our tradesmen are all masters of their craft failure on certain items cannot be ruled out. In this unlikely event we cannot reimburse for the cost of the components.<br> <br>Should you lack some of the minor components we can provide those for you at cost price. We will set up a network of travellers to be able to get the things that you may require. For example if you have the pelts for leather armour but no patterns we will purchase the patterns for you, the only charge we would make is the pattern cost.<br> <br>In the event that you do not have any of the required components we will have a team of sellers in the tunnel offering completed crafted goods for reasonable prices that you may wish to purchase.<br> <br>Our sellers will also be offering some non craftable weapons, armour, and other desireable items for sale.<br> <br>Also on the day we will have a pages and runes giveaway, a few competitions which will be announced on the day and a fine steel giveaway to low level Characters.<br> <br>Please join us to celebrate our first Christmas on XEV.

A site, which mimics the look and content of the official EQ site, was recently discovered to contain an ActiveX backdoor Trojan Horse.  For your reference I will post a copy of this url in plain text (with a few X's placed for caution) and not hyperlinked, <b>DO NOT</b> visit it:<ul><b>xxsephiroth.xoasis.comxx</b></ul><br>Here is a little more information from EQ Live's Associate Producer Gordon Wrinn:<UL><i>Now, if you've curiously gone to the address anyway, you should be able to<br>easily deinfect yourself by deleing EA.HTA from your system (just do a<br>search, it can be found in your C:\windows\start menu\programs\startup<br>directory) as long as you do so BEFORE YOU REBOOT.<br><br>If you've done gone and rebooted anyway, you'll need to go the long route to<br>remove it (see below).  In any case, please feel free to send out the alarm.</i></UL> Gordon also included some important information to tell if you have it, and how to remove it:<UL>**HOW TO TELL IF YOU ARE INFECTED** <br>Go to your start button, press run. Type in msconfig and hit return. Click<br>on the startup tab. Look in the list presented for an instance of ; <br>run= onz.exe <br>If you have this entry, you will need to manually remove it. To remove this<br>back door; <br>1) Uncheck the check mark next to the run= onz.exe line and then click the<br>apply button at the bottom of the window. <br>2) Click on the general tab then click on advanced on the bottom of the<br>window. Check the "enable startup menu" check box, click ok. Click ok again,<br>and allow system to reboot. <br>3) DO NOT let the system boot normally. You MUST select "Safe command<br>prompt" from the boot menu. <br>4) At the DOS prompt, type in "cd windows" (or the path to your window<br>directory), press the enter key. <br>5) Type in "del onz.exe" and then press the enter key. <br>6) Reboot your system again. <br>7) Select "normal" from the boot menu. <br>8) If you get a window stating that the system can NOT find onz.exe, click<br>ok. <br>a. Click the Windows Start Button and then click Run. <br>b. Type in "system.ini". <br>c. You will now see a line that's looks like this; shell=Explorer.exe<br>onz.exe. <br>d. Remove the instance of onz.exe so it looks like this; shell=Explorer.exe.<br><br>e. Save the changes to the file and then reboot once more. <br>You have now removed the trojan from your system. </UL>As long as you haven't stumbled onto this site in the past, or visit it now of course, you should be fine.<br><br>Thanks Gordon!

Here's the latest from Alan from off of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041366.html"><b>Characters Per Account</b></a><br>From what I hear by asking around the office, there is no limit to the total number of characters that you can create, beyond the eight per server. <br><br>Though I have no idea why you would have had problems making new characters&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041401.html"><b>Antonica Out of Date</b></a><br>We reserve the right to do just as you've suggested at any time in the future. With the original game we have to stick to our original system specifications. But there is no reason that we can't use some of the new ideas on the old world. And don't be too surprised if we do&#8230; :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041154.html"><b>Pet UI Suggestions</b></a><br>I've forwarded this one to Rowyl. He's on a well deserved vacation, though, so don't expect a fast reply...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041216.html"><b>Verant Doesn't Care?</b></a><br>Morgian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Well said Moiira and Noonga I'm very sorry you got no help from Lithgar. I'm wondering if others on Povar have gotten -expanded- assistance from any GMs or Guides and if so then there's no reason whatsoever that he couldn't have helped you more regardless of the policies." ]</i></font><br><br>That's not true at all. <br><br>In fact, the exact opposite is true. There should be no exceptions to any company customer service policy. Such things undermine the whole structure of your customer service organization.<br> <br>In this case (from what I understand of it), no exception should have been made. GMs should not be spawning quest NPCs just because the player was unaware of the nature of the NPC in question. <br><br>If there is a flaw here, it's with the quest design, not the way customer service was given. And until I learn more about the quest design, I'm going to reserve comments about the quest design. <br><br>Hadesblood said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Your right Verant doesn't give a rats a-s-s about the average client because they boast 300,000 plus account with more suckers buying it all the time( the actual number is probably around 180,000). <br><br>However verants we dont give a damm about the little guy is going to hurt them when the Online massive game market explodes with competition." ]></i></font><br><br>Actually, we have over 300,000 active subscribers. <br><br>But you know what, all of them are important. I think you do our players a disservice by calling any of them the 'little guy'. Caring about all of your customers is important. Helping each of them individually is a pretty massive challenge. We do our best. <br><br>Noonga wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "1) Verant did not design this quest to be done without reading spoilers. (now I know) <br>2) Verant won't even recognize that it is a frustrating quest. (if you don't read spoilers.) <br>3) Verant doesn't care how long it takes to do the quest. I guess they figure if they make ya do it over, then there is more money for them. Just an assessment."]></i></font> <br><br>I don't know about #1. I agree with you that a quest should be relatively self contained. No, we don't really want you going to spoiler sites for information. However, unlike your earlier claim, it is perfectly reasonable to expect you to talk to higher level characters for hints. In fact, making it so that other players are good sources of information is a good thing, EverQuest is, after all, a social game. <br><br>#2 &#8211; Well, there will always be a fine line between hard and frustrating. And what frustrates you might be the perfect level of challenge for the next person. It's our nearly impossible job to find a place where more people are challenge than bored, and as few people are frustrated as possible. <br><br>My brother, for example, builds puzzles for fun. Me, I would rather eat them. I don't have the patients for it. It's all about how you work as a person, and how well we can anticipate the reactions of over one quarter of a million people&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "And try getting hold of Absor. Unless you post something great to him "Thank you Absor!" or ask them what color they like, its VERY unlikely to get a response from him on an issue such as this." ]></i></font><br><br>Actually, so far I've answered almost every e-mail that I've received. And I respond to any thread that I have an answer for. <br><br>But the question is, what sort of answer are you looking for? My answer, if you really want one, is simple. The GM responded to you in exactly the right way. He was polite and correct. The quest is as it is. It isn't broken. Is it too frustrating for you? It seems so. I'm not happy about that. But I can't change it either. <br><br>About the more general question, should people need to read spoiler sites to do quest? Well, the answer there is pretty easy too. How did that information get to the spoiler site? Someone did the quest first, and without spoiler site help. <br><br>Yes, I would like to see more information available in game. But there is a time when too much information makes it less of a quest and more of a&#8230; what did you call it&#8230; 'Everread' situation. We don&#8217;t want quests to be like those choose your own adventure books either, where you're just reading along and picking yes or no at the end of each paragraph until you get to the end and have to kill something. <br><br>In any case, I have summarized your concern and mailed it to the team. I do agree that there should be enough information to complete every quest without going to the spoiler sites. But this case is&#8230; well, it's borderline. You could, obviously, have completed the quest the first time. But was there enough information there for you? I don't know. I've mentioned it to the team, and I'm sure a debate will ensue about it. But, well, I don't think this quest will be changed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Now, Verant wishes me to kill this thing without reason? ]</i></font><br><br>Well, um&#8230; you are a paladin, right?

Enchanters won't be getting those illusions. The consensus was that they remain unique to those classes. And, it turns out, that I'm not the only person that thinks that undead illusions for enchanters was a mistake. <br><br>Though there was some talk of new illusions based on some of the existing global models, there probably won't be any in the near future. I'm sorry. <br><br>ScarletGhost said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Please stop with the 'no room' excuse. It's getting old and tired and totally un-believable considering that you clearly can make room for other classes."]></i></font> <br><br>Well, it&#8217;s a reason, not an excuse. Yes, we made a decision to use freed up memory space to add those two forms for those two classes. That does not mean that we can ignore the initial system requirements. <br><br>We may not all agree with that decision, but there are no excuses here. <br><br>So far as making bear or spectre available to enchanters as an illusion, the decision is that those forms will remain the distinct province of those classes that have them now. <br><br>And, due to the current restrictions, no new enchanter illusions will be added. <br><br>There might still be some chance that we'll get Illusion: gender functional and add that. And it might be possible that one or more of the existing global models will be made into illusions, that's still under discussion. But right now, things are probably going to remain as they are. <br><br>I know this won't please many of you. For that I'm sorry. And I hope I've explained the technical, gameplay and philosophical reasons for these decisions well enough.</UL>

Shadoe has written his latest editorial entitled <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid977096102,98665,">Role-Playing: The Delicate Art of Storytelling</a>.  It's now available to read in Shadoe's Corner.  Here's a clip:<ul>Those of you who follow <A HREF="http://eqx.simplenet.com/">EverQuest Express</A> every week know by now that the story I've been working on for the past year has finally crawled out of its primeval soup and seen the light of day. The prologue and chapter one have at last been published, and each successive week will reveal another chapter.  Having this, my first <I>real</I> fictional piece, out in the open for everyone to see is an enormous step for me emotionally.  But I'm eager to share it with you all, as I surely think it's a story worth telling.<br><br>Reading the first chapter again at EQX has given me time to reflect on where this all began, and how it evolved into a novel-length tale.  Initially, the plot began with two characters my wife and I created on the Test Server.  As time went on, more and more plot segments fell into place until I was presented with an actual story to tell - something I could work with to bring the world of Norrath alive for myself.</ul>Check it out!

Ozzmar made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000291.html">a big announcement</a> recently on The Arena Board:<UL><i>TEST OF TEAMS<br>GM Ozzmar &#8211; GM Lithgar<br><br>The Dwarf zones into the dusty atmosphere known as the Arena, grumbling over his wet clothes he looks up at the green named coordinators &#8220;Where ya want me!?&#8221; Water flies off in all directions as he shakes his head wildly, his beard letting loose the soakend water. &#8220;That will be 32pp for entry Dwarf!&#8221; the coordinator shouts over the bustling conversations in the entryway. With a grinning smile showing a darkened chipped tooth the Dwarf rustles in his packs, he hands over 30 platinum pieces and 20 gold pieces, which the coordinator gladly accepts. &#8220;To your left dorf!, follow the wall until you see your kind, ye know, Gnomes, Halflings, all of you kneebiters!&#8221; The dwarf gives a deep chuckle and taps his sword while leaning towards the Coordinator &#8220;anytime ye fancy a showdown lad, I&#8217;ll be there to cut ya!&#8221; the dwarf snaps quickly right before he heads off into the dust. <br><br>Following the wall the stocky dwarf slows his pace, he sees a mass of people along the huge the blood caked pillar. The stout half sized warrior draws his sword and keeps a deadened gaze at the onlookers, as eyes meet in hatred. Locked, intent on foreseeing each other&#8217;s moves, the dwarf cautiously passes the crowd. One heckler shouts at him &#8220;Dorf! Joo com ere, mez stik yous now, mez saves us da trubl ltr har har!&#8221; A troll of unordinary size hearing the ogres&#8217; humor stands up &#8220; yessh wwwee kud see some foooood before the battle!&#8221; The troll uncovers an axe, the blade nearly half its size and bounds towards the dwarf. A scaled warrior seeing the ensuing battle springs into action and follows stride along the husky Troll. Upon seeing the danger, the dwarf throws his packs down and braces his stance as he grips both hands on the hilt of his weapon. His veins begin to bulge on his muscles as he raises the sword up into attack position. Unwavering he scowls at the two hideous forms of intelligence charging at him. But suddenly out of no where, a fire of from the heavens crashes between the Troll and the dwarf. An unfortunate Iksar, now just a slab of charred lizard, finds himself making a second attempt in reaching the arena in time. The dwarf nearly falls over in laughter at the turn of events, remembering clearly the warnings of the coordinator, &#8220;No PvP combat until the event starts.&#8221; The dwarf understood that this would be a troublesome rule especially in the arena, but in light of what could have just happened, he was glad the rule has been set. Picking up his packs and giving a gesture all too familiar to the Troll he bolts off further down the wall, deep wheezing laughter could be heard fading away from the evil, dark mob.<br><br>The next mob of people was more his size and nature, the dwarf sheaths his sword back into his packs. Gnomes were chattering to each out other in their fast paced tongue. Halflings were casually resting along the wall, so calm and collected they were he noticed. Some halflings were causally combing their foot hair like they didn&#8217;t&#8217; have a care in the world, as if they impending battle was to never take place. Grimacing, the dwarf never did like the happy folk but in battle there is something to be said about being able to look a comrade in the eyes. Soon though he did find his Kaladim brothers religiously drinking some ale and with an evil grin that would put Bertoxxulus to shame, he joins his brothers in celebration. &#8220;Aye good brothers, pass me some of that fine spirit!&#8221; Wiping his mouth he glances up at his dwarven brothers, &#8220;The purse? How much?&#8221; A dwarf with a holy symbol on his chestplate lifts his head with a smile, &#8220;5,000 shinies brother, bettered with my coin and yours.&#8221; He pauses for just a second before saying &#8220; and I fully intent on getting my coin back and then some.&#8221; All the dwarves and even a few halflings drink to that. <br>A green named coordinator walks up the short team drawing their attention with her words. &#8220;The rules are this!&#8221; as she continues with her speech another cooridinator begins to chant a binding spell on every team member, while taking note of the name of the bounded person and wishing them good luck. The other guide continues &#8220; you will be bound to this location outside of the inner circle, if you fall to misfortune inside the arena you will find yourself where you are now, You are to stay here until the end of the match. If ye decide to break this rule and make way into the inner circle you will be promptly killed and pulled back to your bind point, most importantly though&#8230;&#8221; the coordinator pauses and makes sure everyone is paying attention. She continues, &#8220;&#8230;Noted. This note will be used against your team and will result in 250pp being withdrawn from your winning purse and one less person left standing in the end will not count as standing. Beware gladiators this match could easily end early even if some of your team still stands if in fact this rule is broken.&#8221; The short warriors and casters nod in agreement all peering at each other in hopes that none would break this costly rule. The coordinator continues, &#8220;Once word is giving we will make way into the inner circle and you will all follow me to another pillar much like the one you are now taking shade under. At which point you will gather and patiently discuss your strategies for the battle. &#8220; She pauses. &#8220;YOU ARE NOT to engage anyone before the battle is to begin. If so you will be removed from the event.&#8221; The coordinator then answers a few questions from some not so bright halflings and in time finally beckons the mob to follow her into the deadly inner circle of the arena.<br><br>The short team was not the first to enter the arena, at the far wall one could see a mass of gleaming weapons and all around them magic being casted in astonishing displays of color. The dwarf was not unnerved by this comical show the elves were displaying. He was quite certain that the dwarving clerics would take very good care of him before the match began. The dwarf did respect the numbers the elven brotherhood held though, when he was finally settled in the location the guide had brought them, he stared intently on the elves counting their numbers. He counted 3 or 4 scores of the pointed eared kind from his vantage point. Comparing the force of his army to theirs he knew the elves had a few more blades. This prompted another deep chuckle from the dwarf for he also knew without a doubt that elves were terrible in battle. Feeling confident the dwarf opens his flask of ale and throws back a gulp, undoing his weapon from his pack along with a sharpening stone. The dwarf relaxes in savoring the sound of the stone against the metal and little sparks that it creates. &#8220;Warrior magic&#8230;&#8221; he mumbles letting his thoughts drift over the prizes the purse will buy him.<br><br>The short team and the elf team already stationed inside the arena, next comes in the human team. Their chins held high, they all walk into a chosen spot between the two teams already preparing for battle. Not much is heard from this team as they talk amongst themselves. If looked closely you could see the inner struggles some of the human clans were facing about the two other teams inside the arena. Fortunately, greed has its way of temporally setting aside friendships and the human team starts to enchant each other with spells to improve prowess in battle. The Eurdites form a circle and meditate in unison, while the barbarians much like the dwarfs sit quietly sharpening their weapons carefully inspecting the opposition with wry smiles on their battle worn faces.<br><br>The final team entering the arena creates a terrible display of vulgarity, bringing out the worst in the three other teams. The hated participants make their way to their chosen starting location. All eyes are on them and they know it. Taunting back, the evil team composed of the Trolls, Iksars, Ogres and Dark Elves, answer a barrage of insults with hideous laughter. What was most astonishing about the evil team was the size of the army they brought together. 5 or more scores of the wretched kind were eagerly awaiting a chance to inflict pain and suffering on the other teams. This brought much pride to the evil brethren but on the same token much fear. They all knew that the other teams would likely stop at nothing in bringing them down. The general air of the arena among the other 3 teams seemed to silently reinforce this disheartening thought. <br><br>A cooridinator raises his voice to the point that everyone in the arena could hear. &#8220;All teams are in place, no other participants will be allowed, and no spectators will see this event. The only way to now leave this inner circle is through Victory or Death!!&#8221; this prompts battle screams and mottoes from all 4 of the teams. When the cries calm down the coordinator continues, &#8220;The purse is counted at 7400 platinum pieces to be divided up amongst the winning team. We will now give you 10 minutes to make final preparations for battle. No PvP will be tolerated before the announcement is to begin.!!&#8221; The coordinator heads back to his chosen team and watches for infractions of the rules he stated. <br><br>For the next ten minutes, the atmosphere of the arena is of a calm before the storm. Casters are hurriedly finishing off final buffings to their teammates. Leaders are planning strategies and organizing teammates into groups. Coordinators are taking their places at both entrances readying their weapons for infractions of the rules. A two minutes warning is giving to the zone to prepare for battle.<br><br>A noble High Elf woman makes her way to the very center of the teams. Equipped with a flaming sword, Lady Daegarmo asks for a moment of silence in the seconds before the battle. Welcome to the Test of Teams citizens of Norrath! I wish you all the best of luck! On my mark&#8230;&#8221; She pauses for the remaining seconds of the 10 minute warning. <br><br>At the top of her lungs Lady Daegarmo screams with the power of the Gods, &#8220;FIGHT!!!!!&#8221;<br><br>--<br><br>This is not a pre-scheduled Event. There will be know prior notification as to when this event takes place. But it will. :)<br><br>If you see the announcement of this event on your server, we invite you to rally with your races and take part in the excitement.</i></UL>

Here's today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527.html"><b>Enchanters in Velious</b></a><br>Silh wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "However I think you have been very unfair to us in your decisions on the subject of illusions so far. And lately you have crossed the line for me."]></i></font> <br><br>Well, I might be able to disagree with the 'unfair' part, but I can't argue that we haven't crossed the line, for you. I will try to discuss your concerns, though, and perhaps that way we can move that line around a bit&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Like many enchanters I was surprised to discover that we do not have illusions past the level 44 (and only one at 44). When enchanters asked for finishing the spell line we were told that there was technical issues that stopped you adding new illusions in the game: The character global files (a name like that), which contains all the models that should appear in all zones (players and pets) had a size limited by the old 3D cards. EQ had to be compatible for people with those devices. <br><br>Fine. Something I can fully understand." ]></i></font><br><br>Good. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Enchanters have then proposed to Verant many ideas to go around this limitation. For example: illusion gender, illusion copycat : copy living creature (like minor illusion with living things), illusion animation (our pet). I dont know why they were discarded. For me it was a positive thing that players suggest ideas to you, and ideas that can work and are not unbalancing in any way." ]></i></font><br><br>Let me guess on these now, and I'll try to get more detailed answers for you later. <br><br>Illusion gender, I don't know why that couldn't be done. I do know why illusion copycat wouldn't be done. Keep in mind that your race is one of the things that determines how NPCs react to you. If an enchanter could mimic any creature he or she might very easily be able to travel anywhere with no risk. This isn't something that we want. I'd never heard the idea of Illusion Pet. It's interesting, though I wonder how odd you'd look&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "With the first expansion (Kunark) we were all waiting for the new illusions. Post 50 spells for enchanters meant some illusions for us ? Nothing. Except illusion iksar. What a surprise to discover that there was indeed some room inside this global file. Ok, you were keeping the room for the new iksar race. Again I can understand, except I do not like very much the fact that you didnt tell us the truth at first." ]></i></font><br><br>Some room and a lot of room are two different things. I imagine there will always be some room for things like that. The trick is how we use it, and would we rather give one class a new illusion, or create a whole new race? And, well, you got the new illusion, so I can't see the complaint&#8230; At that time there was 'room' for one more global (or ten more, or whatever, but one more that the programmers felt that they could spare for this use &#8211; remember, video memory does more than just store character art), and it was used for the new race. I see nothing wrong with that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The first disatisfaction for me came with illusion spectre given to necros. After telling us there was no room for a new model, you change your mind... and obviously not for the one that were asking for it. Let me tell you I felt bad : a pet was most important in your eyes than a player. Ok, ok, I know there is a player behind every pet, but that's the way i felt at this time. Again, I can understand that you chose to give some of this precious room in the global file to necros instead of us (it's your game after all), although i felt a little betrayed."]></i></font> <br><br>I would hope that nobody would feel 'betrayed' by anything we do here. We really do try to keep the good of the game in mind when we do stuff. But I can understand the feeling, I imagine that it seemed that someone was favoring one class over another. I don't know the whole story behind how that was done, but I'm certain that nobody was favoring anyone. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "At this point, we, enchanters were quite confident over the fact that you were giving us in the near future a spectre illusion. There was this time no technical issues, since the model was already in the global file. Second big surprise : you chose NOT to give us the illusion. Reason behind ? You told us there was another technical issue (sigh) : the spectre model has too many polygons and enchanters running everywhere in spectre illusion could create lag." ]></i></font><br><br>I've never heard that&#8230; <br><br>My personal opinion is that enchanters shouldn't have any undead illusions, that should all be left to the necros and their type. But I've never heard anyone say that spectres cause lag&#8230; I'll ask about that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Even today it's something I simply dont believe. It was blatantly not the true reason, but you didnt want to tell us the real one."]></i></font> <br><br>And by this you are implying, I gather, that the 'real' reason is something nefarious, such as Verant hates enchanters or something like that. That is, of course, pretty silly. For every Verant employee that plays one class, there are as many that play another. We don't favor any class. From a business standpoint that would be silly, and from a gamer standpoint it would be worse than silly. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "And with Velious Necros got illusion spectre. Hmmm. And you deny it to enchanters again. Hmmm.<br>Again: Ok, I could try to forget that necros are the only one to get a new model. I will insert here what I think is the true reason, which I can almost accept : A lich/spectre form for necros as the supreme spell of their spellbook should have no rival or else you would lose the really cool and unique aspect of this power. Even if it's only an illusion for enchanters, with no bonuses at all, the fact that another class have it would take a part of the "coolness factor". (please remember this argument when you'll come to the last section of my post)" ]></i></font><br><br>Ok, I'll remember&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "What irritated me the most on this subject was that you never answered clearly. Abashi said, if I remember correctly that the spell had a "high level of coolness". Sure it had. At the same time you were telling shamen that their shrink spell could not be used outdoor because It would have been purely a fun spell with no purpose and you didnt want that. I simply dont understand this double-reasonning (and I've never played a shaman in my life). We have entertaining-only illusions (all the undead ones which let me KOS with skeletons !). Fun is obviously a good reason for the existence of a spell. Why necros can have fun spells and not shamans ? Little disturbing to me."]></i></font> <br><br>I'll see if I can get clarification on the shrink thing&#8230; I guess it doesn't make sense to me either, the way you've described it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Back to our enchanter point of view. Ok so you gave necros a spectre pet, then a pet illusion, everything that was asked by enchanters to have their last illusions has been discarded. Ok. <br>Now Velious. We were (at least I was) hoping that something would come from this frozen continent. After all the previous requests for completing the illusion line of spell, and the necro issue, I was sure you would do something. Let me tell you that it was a big disillusion. <br>In velious Druids get a bear pet. Chamans get a bear illusion. No bear illusion for enchanter. Indeed: no illusion at all. Once again you told us that you have found new room in the global file for the bear model. Not for us. I felt very bitter at this point. I had the feeling you were giving purposely the new illusions to all classes except the one that was asking for. But since it's not a reasonnable attitude for a company I think now it's not the case." ]></i></font><br><br>Actually, I think the bear was already global, but I don't know, I'll find out. <br><br>Again, my personal opinion would have it so that only druids and shamans were to get nature-type transformations. I'm all for leaving that unique factor with them, and not giving it to enchanters. Again, that's my personal feeling on it. I'll see if I can get an official response for you on the reasons why. But don't discount the whole uniqueness thing, it's important. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "All these changes have contributed to a vast disatisfaction concerning the illusion issue. However it's true I was stil the master of illusions. Other classes got new changeform spells ? Good for them. I have no upgrade on this topic ? That's your right to not improve my class. But the last and most important change that came with Velious has simply destroy my last hopes and my actual enjoyment on illusions. You have given the summon monster line of spell to the mages. <br><br>This one change has vastly change the way norrath will look like and my illusionnist role in the world. How is it you gave to mages our old proposition of copycat spell for their pet ? How do you expect me not to see this as the ultimate betrayal ? After all this unclear attitude and answers on the illusion issue, I hope you understand how betrayed I can feel. I was -really- having faith in you Verant. I really thought that with Velious we would gain new illusions. We have seen other classes getting illusions with spells, items and so on. But after 2 years I was still hoping for something to come. And you gave more illusions to the mages pet that I could possibly mimic with all my spell line !" ]></i></font><br><br>Calling anything we do a 'betrayal' is too strong. And I also think you're using the word 'illusion' for far too many things. Mages have a summon, not an illusion. Sure, in essence it's not that different. But it's not the same thing. Keep in mind, the pet isn't going anyplace without it's master, so the fact that it might be the same as, and thus aligned with, other monsters in the area isn't as big of a gameplay problem. An enchanter with the ability to turn into something in the zone would be a lot more free to do as he or she pleases, bypassing dangers that might not have been intended to be bypassed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "This is disheartening. <br><br>I have lost the faith. <br><br>And it's not the usual complaint: "someone is getting what i wanted yada yada yada". I will explain why I feel the mage spell was a terrible blow to my illusionist aspect. It's absolutely not the same as the previous spells given to other classes. You have given mages a way to create and control virtually all creature types (not stats but appearance) of the world. I know it's not an illusion, but for me really the distinction here is very small. They have access to more appearance than me, the enchantress, will ever be able to imitate, even in my wildest dreams. I feel as if I am not anymore the master of illusions. I know it's a pet but that's how I feel."]></i></font><br><br>I don't know how to respond to that. I doubt that I can change your feelings about this. All I can say is that nothing was done with the intent of making you, or any enchanter player for that matter, feel unhappy. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "And it's worse than that. <br><br>You know, there was something "magic" with my class. I could surprise people. You know the feeling it is to be "special" in a world where everyone looks the same ? I know that very soon, due to the number of mages in the game, everyone seeing two monsters fighting again each other wont be stunned anymore. "Oh that's just a mage pet" will be the standard reaction. I used to amaze myself each time I saw my charmed mob fighting another mob. A mob fighting a mob is a terrible sight . Think of Hill giants ! Now it will rapidly become -trivial-. All the mages going across Norrath with giant, spider, gnoll, froglock, griffon pets will trivialized what was something unique and rare. <br><br>You have taken this little magic aspect of my class, the "wow" factor that I was so proud about. <br>And for THAT Verant I blame you so much." ]></i></font><br><br>Hang on there&#8230; What you're saying now is that we've ruined it because we created it&#8230; If we had given the exact same ability to, say, clerics &#8211; not that we would, then we would have ruined any illusion like that that we might have given to enchanters. So, by the same logic, if we had just given it to enchanters, it would have been ruined as well. The 'wow' would be gone shortly because enchanters were turning into things, so we would have ruined it for enchanters too, just by giving them the spell&#8230; <br><br>I'm not trying to suggest that your feelings aren't genuine. I'm just trying to keep this in perspective. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "I know many people who chose to start an enchanter for these illusion tricks. With the illusions, ALL the possibly imaginable illusions, given to the pet of a mage, I'm now a second-class illusionist. Not even that. In the game there are NPC enchanters who can turn into aviaks, Sarnaks, gnome robots. I'm limited to a poor set of illusions. I'm ashamed to see what mages can do in comparison. <br><br>I know perfectly that you wont change anything. I'm not even asking for it. Mages deserve a good spell like that. But the right move was certainly not giving away all the illusionnist aspect of my class to them. I feel very sad about all this stuff. <br><br>You know I have come to the explanation of all of this after some reflexion. I see the big picture now. Look at all the new spells introduced in this game after the initial release, especially the expansion ones: VERY few new spells. What you see is : <br><br>- upgrades to old spells<br>- Spells from one class given to another one <br><br>Not new spells. <br><br>That's a tendency that I really dont like in EQ. You are overlapping what all classes are able to do. Although it seems good at first sight, I think it's not the right decision. I'm not the integrist enchanter type which think he should be the only one to cast mez: I was very happy that bards get after such a long waiting a correct mez song. Giving mez to necros was however totally inconsistent with the class. You shouldnt blur the frontier between the classes. There is always a roleplay explanation to give something to someone. But you have to draw a line and dont mix everything. Else you are destroying the reason why someone want to play a specific class."]></i></font> <br><br>I agree, that spreading abilities out to too many classes dulls the class lines, and that's a bad thing in a class-based roleplaying game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "How about giving feign death to enchanters ? It makes sense, it's just an illusion corpse, right ? NO. Because feign death should not be given to everyone. I know it's easy and tempting to get the code of one spell and give it to another class under a new name and hop voila, a new spell is born. You are killing class diversity. Think again at the UO "tank mage" stereotype. We are far away from it in EQ but you are leaning this way. Really it's not the right direction. Please please respect the class specialities. There's no mystery why everyone plays a druid in EQ: they can do every little thing the other classes can, even sometimes better than the specialist classes ! The diversity and a sense of distinction between the classes is -necessary- <br><br>I know it's too late for the summon mob spell. But please acknowledge it was a very bad decision. You didnt had to take a code obviously targeted at the enchanter class (2years waiting...) and give it to the mages." ]></i></font><br><br>No, actually that code was created very specifically for the spell that it was used for. Honestly, a bit of coding magic was done to create it. And it was most certainly done to make the summoning spell, it wasn't some sort of holdover from some attempt at creating an illusion for enchanters. And, well, I don't think it was a bad decision. It's a great spell, and one that was warranted for magicians. If we had created a spell that allowed enchanters to turn into anything in the zone and had not created the Summoning spells, I imagine that some passionate magician might very well have written this post from his or her perspective&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "My fear actually is that the spell design team has moved on EQ2, err... "another project" as you name it. You are not creating new (=potentially unbalancing) spells for the game anymore, but simply moving spells between classes. If it's a design choice, you have to know that this choice for me has been the worse nerf to my enjoyment in the game to date. EQ is not about hack and slash only. I used to love my "surprise them" abilities. They are dead. Charm and illusions in one single move are going to be trivialized. Enchanters were few and their capacities so surprising. Now all the mages out there will make their visual effects common place. End of the "magic feeling" to be a little "special"."]></i></font> <br><br>Well, I disagree. I still think enchanters are the best class for surprises. I won't get into any attempt to convince you that the real magic feeling for playing an enchanter is the way you play it, beyond telling you that a summoned pet is just that, a summoned pet. They aren't very entertaining on their own&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Now I know that no new illusions will ever come. Sorry, but I have lost my faith in you. I believe the "no upgrade policy" about enchanters is due to our reputation on the boards to be crucial to all high level expeditions, to be god-like and so on. It was more simple and honest to tell us the truth you know. <br>Even if new illusions were to come, now that mages have all the possible illusions in a spell line, how could I rival ? I'm not the master of illusion anymore. In my eyes at least." ]></i></font><br><br>There is no policy about not upgrading enchanters. I think you are doing yourself a disservice by believing that there is. I also think that you are putting too much importance on what a magician pet looks like. <br><br>I'll ask a few questions about illusions and see what comes up.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040566.html"><b>More Weapons for Paladins?</b></a><br>I like the idea too (wolf's that is). But it probably can't happen. <br><br>First, as we all know, making a horse that could be ridden as a separate item is not going to happen. It's not something that we're going to try (as far as I know) with the engine. Just imagine player summoned boats in every zone&#8230; <br><br>But the idea of, essentially, an illusion for paladins that makes them look like a horse and rider and gives them some buff (like faster movement and maybe some stats) has flaws too. <br><br>All paladins with that spell up would look exactly the same. The illusion would have to completely rewrite the look of the character, and isn't going to take into account what armor the paladin is wearing. He'll look exactly like every other paladin on the same horse. They might be distinguishable by their weapons&#8230; <br><br>And, well, frankly, the next on the list (in my mind) for some new illusions (and use of the oh-so-precious video memory) should be enchanters. <br><br>But, it's a fantastical idear, and I'll pass it to the team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040623.html"><b>Identical User Names</b></a><br>I can't help but think of the Bill Murray movie, Multiplicity...(Ed. note: Wasn't that Michael Keaton?)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040632.html"><b>"How can you not twink?"</b></a><br>I've played many, many characters.

GameSpy has posted their <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/reviews/december00/sov/">two cents about what they think of Verant's recently released Velious</a> expansion.  When all is said and done the reviewer awards SoV with an 88/100 score, not too shabby!  The article concludes on this note:<UL>Even with a few difficult zones and dangerous NPCs around every corner, Scars of Velious is an outstanding addition to the EverQuest universe and is a must-have for all hardcore players. With a ton of new items to be discovered and over a dozen zones to be explored and conquered, S.o.V. is going to keep the EverQuest community busy for many, many months. Those who are just starting out might want to wait until they're above level 30 before purchasing S.o.V., as the new zones would be more or less a suicide run. <br><br>Of course, that could just add to the adventure, now wouldn't it?</UL>
