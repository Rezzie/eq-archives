The next place to <a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/Reviews/Item/0,6,0-4078,00.html">review Kunark</a> is GameCenter.  In their review they award Kunark a 9 out of 10 rating, not bad if I say so myself.  Here's the traditional clip from the review:<UL><I>There are some issues with Kunark, however. The higher polygon count causes some lag problems in the new city of Fironia Vie. This lag is related to the CPU, video card, and the amount of RAM you have, and is not an Internet issue. Although the box lists 64MB of RAM as a minimum requirement, 128MB is a more realistic figure. The expansion was also released with some sound problems and noises are sometimes mismatched with some creatures. For instance, if you kill a saber-toothed tiger, it will sound like a human as it dies. Finally, the game could use some proofreading, as in-game text contains many spelling errors and typos ("Agressor [sic] Goblins"?). </I></UL>

Gordon was posting up a storm on the Gameplay Board as usual.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038301.html"><b>Iksar Can Wear Plate?</b></a><br>Keep in mind that "Plate texture" does not necessarily equal "Plate item". Rangers, for example, cannot wear plate, yet have a host of items out there that use the plate texture. This is primarily because the plate texture looks better when tinted. <P>Rubicite is a good example of a plate-looking item that is really chain.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038343.html"><b>No Level 49 Spell</b></a><br>There isn't a 49th level song at this time, and it looks like there might not be one. We've used the rest of the cool ideas that people had on the 51+ songs, where bards get two per level. I&#8217;m certainly willing to listen to suggestions though and talk them over with GZ. As it is now, we could throw a song together just for the sake of putting one in, but it wouldn&#8217;t be cool.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038348.html"><b>Wolfform Issue</b></a><br>Cros and Holly shouldn't be jumping on Druids in wolfform. I've asked the faction designer to take a look. <P>Cros and Holly are Protecters of Pine, correct?<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038299.html"><b>PnP  Addition Idea</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Can you add in that if a caster and a warrior is in an argument over a warrior weapon camp, that the warrior has priority over the caster? Chances are the caster has already farmed it a few times and saw how easy it is to sell so he keeps coming back, where the warrior is just trying to get one on his own. Comments?]</i><P> I don't think that we want to get into situations that we are policing camps based upon what drops. Camps are for whomever is willing to spend the time at them.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038290.html"><b>More Memorization Slots</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I'd like to be able to have more spell slots so I don't have to memorize spells everytime my buffs run out.]</i><P> No plans to do this. The limitation to the choice of spells available to you at any given time promotes strategy. Some classes have a harder time with this than others. Wizards, for instance, usually don't have a hard time making their choices, where enchanters (and necromancers from personal experience) will always have an ongoing debate as to what the best spell lineup is. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038176.html"><b>Why do other classes have a level 55 spell and Paladins don't?</b></a><br>Just checked my list. There's a spell on there. If there's not really one in game at that level, there's probably a typo. I'll check with GZ next time I see him.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038164.html"><b>Drops in Kunark</b></a><br>The updates that we made to item drop percentages and locations were not directly based upon complaints from people about loot being too comon, but rather economic reports that we run to determine the health of the economy and the rates at which items enter the world. <P>Basically, once we got 100K people over in Kunark, we'd have found the problems regardless, so it isn't the "fault" of the players who brought the issue to public light.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038169.html"><b>Compass Training</b></a><br>Well we don't have any way that we could easily implement skill-increase potential based on what is in your inventory on a per-skill basis. I suggest you train the skill up a bit. The way skill increases work is that they require a successful skill check before they'll roll for a skill increase. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038170.html"><b>Server Situation</b></a><br>There's really no situation that could cause everything on the server (including NPCs) to "hang" for an amount of time. If there was a network connection issue, PCs could lag, however NPCs would go about their normal business. If it were a server problem, it wouldn't affect everyone on the server, just everyone in a particular zone. <P>If the server were to have a problem causing the zone to hang for a bit, spells ticks wouldn't expire either. I imagine what happened in your case was a network problem. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038159.html"><b>More Communication Ideas</b></a><br>The Guild MOTD sounds nifty. I'll pass it around.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038138.html"><b>Hotkey/Mouse Problem</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I'm just curious about the fact that pressing the keyboard shortcut for a hotkey doesn't work while medding. Is this a bug? You can press the hotkey button with the mouse and that works fine. Is there any chance this could be fixed? My carpal tunnel syndrome is getting worse because of this 8-).]</i><P> Since we allow the buttons to be pressed with the mouse, I'll check with the client programmer to see if we can also allow the key to be pressed as well.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038145.html"><b>Faction Information</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I am a DE Agnostic Enchanter. I'm not KoS in Freeport, Qeynos, Erudin, and several other non-evil cities. Yet I'm KoS in FV. Why is this? It seems completely based on race, and not at all on religion. I figured that by being agnostic and not being able to do religious specific quests would at least allow me to not be KoS in both good and evil cities on Kunark. This seems unbalanced...]</i><P> Firiona Vie is an outpost built by the High Elves and Wood elves, who do not like dark elves (regardless of religion). I've seen some DE people who managed to get their faction with Felwithe and Kelethin up to the point that they could go in, but FV is a different faction, so you start over there. <P>Factions are based on four components: <P>1. Your race<br>2. Your religion<br>3. Your class<br>4. Things that you've done. <P>Any of those is sufficient to make an NPC dislike you. Just being a dark elf is enough in this case.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038147.html"><b>Quest Ideas</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Many items are NO DROP that, once something better is found, sit in the bank and rot. Example, Razing Sword of Skarlon, great sword, collecting dust. (this is just an idea for warrior ATM) For ALL races, make a 45+ quest starting with your guildmaster that will USE all these no drop items. So, you turn in the Skarlon Sword, Fleshripper, an item from sky, AND a sword from the gods, and you get THE BEST warrior weapon, period. None of this AWESOME l33t sword some newbie can win in a lotto in some zone, I am talking about a DIFFICULT quest to finish, that takes a LOT of time, and a lot of effort, and with THE BEST reward one can get. The same could be done for ALL melee classes. Every melee class deserves somethig for their efforts, the paladins got FA (which could have been a better sword btw, nothing in Kunark should be better, UNLESS FA becomes a quest component.) It would give a lot of classes something to drive for beyond the next level.]</i><P>We like this idea, but it does have a downside, that being that it causes people to want to go camp something outside their level-range. For instance, there is a quest for Rangers that requires the EBW as a component, and this was a frequent complaint when this quest went in. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038153.html"><b>Ideas for Communication</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Would it be possible, or difficult, to implement a way for members of a class to talk to each other over a channel (like guildtalk). I think this could be useful for players communicating with others in their class regarding quests, strategy, exchange of research components, etc. e.g. /class Anyone have any information on the spell call of bones?]</i><P> Blanket communication channels tend to reduce the sense of community in game, rather than enhance it. Instead of dealing with a specific person, and forming a relationship with them, it ends up pretty cold. This is somewhat apparent with zone-wide communications such as /shout and /ooc, however it's not as bad as a server-wide mechanism would be. In addition to this, there are some technical issues surrounding this idea (e.g. the number of additional packets to broadcast) which make the idea unattractive.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038084.html"><b>Splitting the Loot</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Every day, I get into groups with greedy master looters. When I master, I split after every battle and sometimes short myself just so the group gets an even split (i.e. if I loot 5 pp 4 gp in a group of 6 I /split 6). I just think it's fair.]</i><P> We did the loot items due to the number of complaints about the ninjalooting of rare and expensive items. Coin really doesn't fit this description, so the best suggestion that I can offer is that you only master-loot with people that you trust. <P><i>[Quote from original post: And yes, /autosplit is terrible. If you have 6 people, and the MOB drops 5 plat, 5 gold, 5 silver, and 5 copper, guess what happens? The looter gets 5 plat, 5 gold, 5 silver, and 5 copper, the other 5 players get NADA (because 5 coins of each type can't be evenly distributed among 6 members). ]</i><P>This was actually done based upon numerous requests from people playing the game in beta. They got tired of ending up with tons of heavy coin due to the magical splitting of it. If you are masterlooting, autosplit can work very well providing the person doing the final /split is aware that coins are not automatically reduced to even the split. If you are not masterlooting, an extra coin here, one coin less there, isn't a big deal and evens out in the long run.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038127-2.html"><b>Does Grouping Give You an EXP Bonus?</b></a><br>There is both an XP bonus assigned per kill based upon the number of people in your party, and it is also expected that you can take more critters in the same amount of time in excess of what you could do solo. <P>For instance, if a solo person can kill 1 blue mob every 2 minutes, then a group of two might be able to do 3 in that same amount of time, yielding 50% (plus the bonus) more experience per person per time unit.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038039.html"><b>Stats Clarification</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Before the release of ROK there was a post by someone on the Verant staff stating that basically EQ does not have the best stats system, and that the effects of stats have been purposefully minimized to reduce the the effects of twinking.]</i><P> I don't recall anyone saying that. What I do recall saying is that the reason we don't have any +skill items out there was to reduce the impact of twinking. Stats really don't affect twinking as their effect is scaled based upon the level of the recipient. For instance, a level 1 wizards with 200 INT has roughly 1 mana point more mana than one with 100 INT. <P>One other thing, I've seen a rumor going around that the effects of stats were drastically reduced at some point in late beta. Nothing like that happened.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/038030.html"><b>Pronunciation</b></a><br>We're actually thinking about doing a pronunciation key. Here's a few. If anyone has any others that they'd luck to ask about, feel free: <P>Qeynos = `Key-nos<br>Kunark = `Coo-nark<br>Najena = `Nah-jen-uh<br>Guk = Guck<br>Ykesha = Yuh-`kesh-uh<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037815.html"><b>A Compelling Reason</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: This is NOT a class envy post. I just want to thank you, Gordon, for supplying us with the answer to the basic question of "what makes a class ballanced?" I, for one, think that you and Verant are using entirely the wrong yardstick to measure ballance, but at least I understand where you are coming from when you say class x, y, or z is in fact ballanced in spite of my opinions and observations otherwise.]</i><P> I respect your opinion, and thank you for voicing it, however it is very important that everyone is aware that balance does not equal equality in all things. The pinnacle of a good class-based system is interdependence, and homogenization of the classes doesn't promote that. <i>[Quote from original post: 1. Is there any available information as to how many characters of each class exist in Norrath?<P>2. Is there comparitive information as to the number of class-hours each class has since the game began (I know, this is a bit much, but I want to know if the 8.6% of the existing characters that are of class X are actually played or just hold twink items, etc.)]</i><P> We have access to the information, but it's not something that we'd generally release in a tabulated form. One thing I should mention is that we had no expectation that the number of characters in game would be spread across the classes evenly. This can easily be illustrated on the group level. For instance, there is no point of diminishing returns when adding warriors to a group. In other words, the benefit to the group that one warrior adds can always be doubled by adding another. Some other classes can't do that. For instance, adding a second bard to your group will not do as much as adding the first one did.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037931.html"><b>Monk Questions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi - Is the monk robe quest still on the 'fix list'?]</i><P> It's on the re-evaluation list still. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 2) The 'combine' attempt when all the pieces are assembled has a chance of failing.

The only thing that is illegal in regards to anything of this sort would be exploiting guard range issues, such as attacking someone in guard range while you are out of that range.

Just from patrolling the Gameplay Board this morning, I can tell that Verant's Gordon Wrinn didn't catch much sleep last night.  Not only did he post more, but he posted as early as 2:00AM in the morning.  Here's the Morning Edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037914.html"><b>The Gorillas</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The Gorillas in the Burning Woods are not animals.... Is this as intended? If so, why? There is absolutely no point for furthering the animal-line in the Druid's spell list if there are no animals on Kunark. To tell the truth, I have yet to find one creature that is an animal...]</i><P> Actually none of the Gorillas are animals as I recall, and I believe that these particular ones are undead.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037929.html"><b>Hide & Hate</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why doesn't hide wipe the hate list?]</i><P> Because we didn't implement it as an escape spell. It used to do this in beta, but it trivialized combat and provided too big of an advantage to those who could invis. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037959.html"><b>Timorous Deep Not Itemized?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: just wanted too point this out since i've not even been able to get a coin from a bandit]</i><P> No coin? That certainly doesn't sound right. I've sent it to the EQLive team for investigation. Much thanks.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037967.html"><b>Refund Problems</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: This might sound a bit harsh but I feel pretty strongly about people charging my creditcard for something they find out they cant deliver and then not refunding my money IMMEDIATELY!]</i><P> We apologize for any delay. We are processing refunds as fast as possible in the order that the requests were received. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037874.html"><b>Tech Support Number</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Is Verant going to add "a" second phone number to call now that the masses of subscribers have gotten way out of control for 7 technicians to handle? Trying to talk to a live Verant employee is like trying to talk to a live KROQ employee.]</i><P> It's one phone number, but it certainly is more than one line. The line rolls over to the next available technician.<P> The majority of EverQuest technical support occurs at installation time. Once people can get in game, only a very small percentage ever need tech support again. Certainly there are cases where that number and percentage increase, such as in the case of ROK, however the number of people that we have maning the phones do a very good job of keeping up with the load.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037887.html"><b>Ressurection Line Nerfed?</b></a><br>I've heard a couple reports of this (thanks to those who emailed me). No intentional change was made to this line, but I've forwarded to the test team to check it out. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037782.html"><b>Clipping Plane & Kunark Preformance Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: In a older game I used to play, (Wing Commander 3) it had a setting that made the game detect if the framerate dropped below a certain level. If this happened, the game lowered the grafics lvl automaticly to improve preformance. <P>I suggest that you implement something like this in EQ. Instead of lowering grafics, you could tell the game to stop drawing the last 1/3'd of the tree branches if the frame rate gets to low. As I understand, its the tree branches that cause the low FPS. And if you have 30 trees in the front 2/3's of your screen, then the only thing you'll see in the back 1/3'd of your screen is possibly the trunks anyways. So just have the game draw the trunks if the framerate drops to low. <P>I'd really appriciate some feedback on this idea. ]</i><P>Though we could probably have it so that the clipping plane automatically came in or the particle engine turned off, I suspect people would find this more annoying than anything. Our engine doesn't have the capability to automatically turn off features such as this.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037635.html"><b>Haste Items Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Since learning that +mana items are also subject to the level restriction and have a reduced effect at lower levels]</i><P> Actually that's not entirely accurate. You can only raise your mana with +mana items based upon the total base mana that you have. For instance, if someone has only 50 mana, and they don a +50 mana item, they do not have 100 mana. This isn't a function of the level, but of total mana. We won't let someone double their mana supply with +mana items. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Im wondering if permenant haste items fall under this rule as well. I know that the exe axe doesnt proc haste til level 30 so Im suggesting that permenant haste items like the FBSS and Mith 2H dont work until a certain level or have a reduced effect ]</i><P>Permanent-haste items do not share the level restrictions of a proc on a weapon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037629.html"><b>Anti-Ninja Looting Idea</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: That way while one loot attempt could be explained away, if someone started clicking up a storm you'd know they were doing it and at least be ready. In the very least you could deny the ninja looter and maybe other people getting on his back before hand would get him to stop since he already knew he was busted and could only make it worse]</i><P> Good idea, but once the creature is dead, the system no longer has a list of people who have the right to loot the corpse other than the legal looters. Perhaps a message could be sent to them in this case, but don't you think people would get upset when they leave a corpse to lie and have to put up with 2 minutes of "Bob tried to loot a_bat's_corpse00"?. I'll ask around, but tell me what you think.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037593.html"><b>Iksar Warrior Pike-Quest Flaw</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: If there isn't a way to get a new Partisan's Pike (it's Lore Nodrop so trade or /consent doesn't work) Please put such method in the game. Like you ask tell your guildmaster you lost your pike and you will receive a new one (maybe even dropping a bit of faction because you are a disgrace to the guild).]</i><P> This is part of a growing series of "Chain Quests" in the game, quests that lead to other quests. <P>This is as it is designed. I'd recommend that people put their starting item in the bank until they get past level 5 and don't have to worry about their corpse decaying after a mere 30 minutes. Only the dedicated who have protected their items since the beginning will get the final item.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037609.html"><b>Human Monk vs. Iksar Monk</b></a><br>Previously, with only one class capable of becoming a monk, balancing the monk class on the basis of race was not difficult. However, the inclusion of the Iksar, with many different racial attributes, has made this a bit harder. <P>Infravision and regen make life much easier for the young Iksar, which leaves us with a need to validate humans as a monk class. In addition, monks are the only race that get an AC bonus based upon their race. This leaves them already getting one just by virtue of being a monk, and now another because they are also an Iksar. <P>In this case, we decided that in addition to including the expected XP and faction issues, we've also made it so that Iksar monks will not be as "good" at *being* monks as humans. It's not by a large extreme, but human monks will always be better at doing what monks do: dealing damage.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037587.html"><b>Make Summons More Useful</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Those summons would actually be much cooler if the bags and items we summoned didn't disappear so quickly after LD.]</i><P> Well we used to have them hang around if you went LD, however it became commonplace for people to LD out instead of camping in order to keep the items, so we had to change it to the way it is now. Extending the time they remain is unfortunately not feasible, as the servers no longer keep track of a character once they time out and are removed from the world. Changing the way this works would really impact how the core engine runs.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/022759.html"><b>More Music Equipment Wanted!</b></a><br>GZ is out of the office for the next couple of days, but I'll ask him about it the next time I see him.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037217.html"><b>Mosquito Wings</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: On the 27th I was able to obtain several wings for the newbie shaman quest for Iksar's. I camped for the night, and when I awoke the next day all my wings were gone and after hours of hunting mosquito's I was unable to find any wings in the loot.]</i><P> This was our fault. One of the guys attempted to make the wings stackable, but something didn't work out which caused the mosquito wings to become invalid. This caused them to disappear.</UL>

Of the 40 threads at the time that I'm writing this:<br><br>13 are complaining about rogues<br>2 about rangers<br>2 about paladins<br>1 about wizards<br>1 about magicians<br>1 about druids<br>1 about enchanters<br>1 about necros<br><br>That's over half of the posts on the first page that basically consist of "My class isn't balanced, isn't powerful enough, isn't desired in groups, can't do something some other class can." or something along those lines. The other 18 posts are perhaps issues that we'd like to answer, but people constantly bumping the class-envy posts keeps pushing them down. That isn't fair to the people who have issues that we can and are willing to address or do something about. <br><br>I'm very sorry if we haven't been able to give everyone the answer that they are looking for in regards to their class, but being as clear as possible, notwithstanding current planned and announced enhancements, we consider all classes to be essentially well-balanced at this time. This means that we feel that there is a compelling reason to play each class beyond the desire to roleplay. It does not mean that every class is equivalent in offensive power, desirability to a group, or has some unique special skill or ability, just that there are tangible reasons someone might choose to play your class.<br><br>I don't wish to get involved in the unending recursive arguments that surround class-envy posts any longer (e.g. Explain how we are balanced, what is the compelling reason to play us, etc). This is all meant to be part of the discovery process in the game. Part of the process where everyone finds out what character class suits them. We can&#8217;t tell you what you should like about your class, and if there is no other way to convince to you like your class other than to start handing out enhancements, then we may be at an impasse.<br><br>If you wish to keep discussing these issues on our boards, it&#8217;s perfectly fine. We&#8217;ll read them and we may respond to some issues raised from time to time providing that the content is respectful and the answer would be of benefit to players as a whole, but we won&#8217;t feel compelled to answer class-envy posts regardless how many people comment in them. We&#8217;ll close the threads when they hit between 300-400 posts, and if the number of threads reach spam proportions (like the 13 rogue posts on the first page), we&#8217;ll start closing them before that. <br><br>It is not at all our intention to suppress anyone&#8217;s ability to discuss these issues, but we want to be sure that people with issues that we can address, and that we&#8217;d like to address, have priority on the boards. <br><br>Thank you for understanding, and I do intend to follow up on this thread today if content allows.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Here's today's edition of the Gordon Infobits hot off the pages of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037846.html"><b>Damage Bonuses</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Is there any reason why for melees who dual weild, the level damage bonus is only calculated on your primary hand?]</i><P> That's just the way that it was set up for balance reasons. The enhanced melee damage is only applied to the primary hand, not the off-hand. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037739.html"><b>Tishan's Relocation = Mass Suicide?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well, I can't see the usefullness of group evac'ing a party to the middle of Skyfire mountains where numerous aggro 45+ MOBS are ready to eat your already HP and Mana depleted group for lunch. Gordon, please help us wizards see the point of this spell and why I wasted 19pp to only to get 6 honest people killed?]</i><P> Sounds like you might have gotten a bit unlucky with that cast. We'll check the destination and look to see whether we can move it someplace a little safer, but as a general rule I'd consider that spell a last-ditch effort to save the group without leaving the zone. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037687.html"><b>Why do snakes kick?</b></a><br>The skills that NPCs have are based on level and class, not on the model that they use. For instance, that puma that you are fighting might really be monk. I suppose that it might have been nice if we had a way to suppress the use of certain skills based upon body type.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037656.html"><b>Mana Regen Nerfed?</b></a><br>There has been no intentional change, however due to the number of people reporting it I'm not ready to dismiss it just yet. However, I highly suspect that the observations are due to a number of things, not related to the actual rate. For instance: <P>1. Perception: Mana above level 50 continues to increase at a rate much like it was before, however the mana regen rate does not increase on the same curve, giving the perception that it takes longer to med, even though you are still getting the same amount of mana back per tick. This is something that people also notice and claim as they level up or gain +INT/WIS/MANA items. They increase the amount of mana that they have without increasing the regen rate in a linear manner. <P>2. Watched Pot: The addition of Kunark has caused people to spread out more. The net result of this is that the ratio of people to targets has improved. Where a group used to be at full mana the next time it was their "turn" to kill a particular spawn, they are now staring at their mana bars while a surplus of critters walk by that they could be killing. <P>3. Placebo Effect: The "Placebo effect" also causes the "Watched Pot". Someone, perhaps due to one of the reasons mentioned above, perceives that the mana regen rate has changed, and comments on it. This causes other people to become sensitive to the issue, causing them to pay close attention to their mana bars, giving the impression that it is taking longer to regen. <P>4. Of course there is always the good old fashioned "bug", which shouldn't take too long for us to figure out as soon as I can corner the programmers :)  I'm looking into it this afternoon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037731.html"><b>Loot Tables Changed: Who Gets Hurt?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Loot tables changed - Who gets hurt... Those that had delayed shipments. They should have stayed the same so everyone had the same opportunity... What about the people still waiting for thier CD's?]</i><P> If "fairness" is the main concern here, there's really no way to make these changes "fair". Certainly we could have waited until everyone (within reason) received their CD's, but the same subject of fairness would come up for those who have had their CDs and just now decided to make the trip to Kunark. <P>Yes, the 10s of thousands of people entering Kunark did bring a few loot issues to light. There were cases where loot was dropping in the wrong place, and it has in most cases been moved to a more appropriate location. We even had a few dragon/god items dropping on level 40 creatures (though at very small percentages), and the people who were there first certainly lucked out. Unfortunately at some time we have to fix these errors, and making it fair in everyone's eyes probably isn't possible. <P>Please, lets not look at this as people who got there later getting hurt, but perhaps as people who got there sooner getting lucky.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037615.html"><b>Killing Guards</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It is getting alittle tiresome in Butcherblock trying to find a guard being that everyone is camped and murdered the minute they spawn. You can see the bodies of newbies at the guard stations because they were foolish enough to believe that they could get some back up there with a battle gone bad. Why don't you make the killing of a guard a faction hit that so that the individual is automatically KOS in good cities. That would curb this practice immediately.]</i><P> The goal was to have each city have a faction associated with it, making it possible for someone to upset one city and remain in good standing with another. In some cases it's apparent that this may not have worked just like we would have liked it to, and we're looking for different ways to respond. We'll probably look at making some of the guards a little less appetizing. <P>One thing to remember is that the goal of the faction system is to embrace the idea that no one really believes that they are evil. For instance, the dark elves do not think that they are evil, they are just uncompromising in their application of their morality. They probably feel that the high elves are evil.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037617.html"><b>Hot Key Problems</b></a><br>The buttons are a bit messed up due to a graphics file that went in last week. We've got it corrected, but it's a pretty sizable download (about 1.5 MB) so we wanted to hold off a little while. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037640.html"><b>Can Enchanters have Illusion: Specter? </b></a><br>Though we certainly appreciate everyone's desire to look "cool", we don't want to open this model up to player characters. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037564.html"><b>Good Loot Attracts People</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: However, with the coming of Kunark, most people congregated to Burning Woods and Karnor's Castle. Why? Because the loot was good.]</i><P> Well it's more of a combination of good loot, and the fact that Karnor's is the first dungeon that people find when they get to Kunark. People will fan out to the other dungeons as their comfort levels grow and as Karnor's becomes crowded. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Sure, Chardok looks very good, but a raid was done in TM and we found 2 staffs that were completely useless (like 7/38 2HB or something). Any ETAs on itemizing the zones? I'm rather disappointed that Kunark was so hastily finished and zones are not truly complete.]</i><P> Your assertion that the other zones are "unfinished" or "unitemized" isn't true. I'm not sure how much time you spent in them, or how deep you went in, but they are very well itemized. It will just take a little while for the masses to explore these zones and see what they have to offer.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037560.html"><b>Expansion Spells</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Aside from the ones that you can buy from Kunark vendors, where are these new spells? I heard Sky, but I know a lot of people that were there over the weekend, and they saw ZERO spells drop. Has anyone found them? I heard about a L60 mage pet spell dropping in Skyfire, but that is it. Could it be that Verant hasnt added them yet? This is ridiculous.]</i><P> 50+ spells are either obtained via merchants, quests, or loot drops. They are out there, but you'll probably want to make your way to an area that is a little more ripe with magic. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037561.html"><b>Who Ya Gonna Call?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: When we can prove the troubles are on Verant's side...can we do the same and expect a response?]</i><P> Of course, but the nice (and bad thing) about running a destination service where 25-60K people are connecting at once is that when we have a problem, we know it because we lose a good number of people at one time. We have alarms set up internally that polls the number of people connected and lets us know if a number of people drop all at one time. Aside from the zone server, where we could lose only a small number of people, any other error that we have control over would affect thousands of people. <P>Source services (such as ISPs) don't have that advantage (and disadvantage). ISP XYZ might only have a few people connecting to the EverQuest servers, so when they have a problem with the route to us, they only have that small number of people who call in. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037551.html"><b>What is balance?</b></a><br>Balance is about there being a compelling reason to choose one class over another aside from the desire to roleplay a particular type of character. It really isn't about relative power compared to another class, nor would we claim that that relative power is meant to be fixed from levels 1 to 60. <P>Offensive power is only one equation in determining "balance". Other factors are usefulness to a group, and special skills or abilities. For instance, though a wizard's teleporting capability does not at all affect their offensive efficiency, it does contribute to other factors of "balance". A bard gives up much offensive prowess in exchange for being a very desirable member of a group. <P>By "compelling reason", we mean that one class does not invalidate another. For instance, the monk can do more offensive damage at a give level than any warrior. Now, if they had the hitpoints of a warrior, could wear their armor, and carry as much weight, then there would be no compelling reason to play a warrior other than roleplay. The monks weakness opens the door for another class to be viable. <P>Now any time I speak about "compelling reasons", posts on the board follow along the lines of "Just what is the 'compelling reason' to play a [insert class here]." All I can say in all of these cases is that "compelling" is in the eyes of the beholder, and I would encourage everyone to find that out on their own. Our opinions might differ from yours, but we believe that there are compelling reasons to play every class in the game, which is why we consider them balanced.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037417.html"><b>/Yell Idea</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Would it be possible to change the 'Yell' command so that when it is used, the player's name turns yellow, or flashes, or something similar for a short time?]</i><P> Interesting idea. We'll look into it.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037416.html"><b>Advanced Communication</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Custom send groups. Being able to add friends from all guilds, or unguilded to one send, and vice versa, would make talk between friends far easier.]</i><P> We're still working on an enhancement called /ftell. When implemented, it will send your message in a /tell to everyone on your friends list. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037431.html"><b>Iksar and Qeynos Faction Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I have been killing Gnolls in BB for almost a total of 15 hours and have yet to see a faction change. I would thhink I would decrease to atleast threateningly by now.. but nope. Any general idea of how many hours I will need to spend in BB total to get good enough faction to enter Qeynos alive being an Iksar Monk of Cazic?]</i><P> Some factions have thresholds for how good or how bad they can get. I wouldn't be able to comment on whether or not it was this that you are hitting here (haven't checked to be honest, but wouldn't be able to say if I had), but it's possible.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037473.html"><b>The Timorous Deep</b></a><br>I'm sorry guys, but I really can't speak further about this issue until the zone is widely known. To speak about it further before then would be tantemount to releasing spoilers. If you'd like to bring it back up in about a month or so, I'll be happy to discuss it then.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037474.html"><b>Hacking an Account</b></a><br>I'm really not sure how to respond to the question. The only way that someone can "hack" your account is if they obtain your login name and password. We've seen many email scams sent to people attempting to gain access to that information, which is responsible for some "hacking", we've also a huge number of auction scams where "hacking" is claimed. <P>For obvious reasons, I can't go into our internal security proceedures, nor the investigation process. We know that your data is safe once it enters our facility. We really have no means to take responsibility for anyone who gives out there SN and password, but we nonetheless investigate claims. We won't knowingly let someone keep playing on an account that we know to be stolen, however the ultimate protection of the account is in the hands of each customer. </UL>

A new <a href="/lore/editorials">Editorial</a> has been published taking <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid957225171,83248,">another look at the Iksar Faction issue</a>.  Here's an excerpt from our latest editorial:<UL><i>With the addition of the Iksar race, there is much debate as to why Iksar are KOS to all other races. This is an attempt to address this issue by looking at historical events in our world to understand why the Iksar are KOS to all of Norrath. <br><br>OK. Look at the discovery of Kunark from this angle. When the Europeans discovered the Americas, they encountered Indians, Aztecs, Incas, Mayans, and more. The natives had established cities, especially the Incas, Aztecs and Mayans. You draw a comparison to Cabilis here. When the Europeans explored the new continent, they found a culture foreign and barbaric to them. They witnessed virgin sacrifices, the killing of a woman every morning to make the sun rise, the drinking of blood, and more. The Europeans did not say, "Hey, go board our ships and check out Europe. It's a neat place." The Europeans slaughtered them. It was very rare for an American Indian to travel to Europe and walk around freely. It was until the late 1500s/early 1600s before American Indians were taken to England under the guise of freedom (Read the factual tale of Pocahontas). What I am getting at here is that, Iksar would naturally be KOS in all foreign lands, at least for a long period. </i></UL>

<b>Anarchy Online Vault Opens For Funcom's Sci-Fi Online World</b><br><br>By the year 29,475 AD, mankind has reached far into the stars, populating<br>many worlds in the Milky Way. Among these is Rubi-Ka, a barren desert<br>planet plagued by sandstorms and heavy winds.  Located on the distant edge<br>of the galaxy, it is made important by the presence of Notum, the substance<br>that powers nanotechnology.  For many years, the planet and the extraction<br>of Notum have been controlled by the powerful galaxy-wide Omni-Tek<br>corporation, but not without constant conflict against rebel clans opposing<br>its regime.<br><br>Based on this long-standing conflict, <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/" target="_new">Anarchy Online</a> is<br>developer Funcom's massively multiplayer persistent online world that will<br>receive its first major public exposure at E3 next week.  With beta testing<br>slated to begin shortly and a projected release date of late this year,<br>Anarchy Online promises to become the first major online world with a<br>far-future science-fiction setting.  <br><br>With publicity and activity set to ramp up sharply, we are very happy to<br>announce the launch of <a href="http://aovault.ign.com/" target="_new">Anarchy Online Vault</a> to provide complete news and<br>information coverage of this exciting title to the online gaming community.<br> As our launch feature, we are pleased to present the first <a href="http://aovault.ign.com/features/journal/050100.shtml" target="_new">Anarchy Online Developer Journal</a> in which Producer Tommy<br>Strand provides a very personal look at his game.  Here is a snippet to<br>whet your appetite:<br><br>I'm often asked: "What will make Anarchy Online different from the other<br>games out there or the games in the near future?" Let me share with you the<br>answer I usually give: First of all, we are 'it' this year. There won't be<br>any other big online games coming out in 2000. <br><br>To top that, we offer the first persistent science-fiction world. We focus<br>on the social setting, but give the player the option to choose a<br>single-player experience in a multiplayer setting. We have created a system<br>where the player can enter at any time, and still have stuff to do. Our<br>first focus was to abolish the "camping" feature; the second was to enable<br>play during a lunch break without having to run around searching for<br>monsters - or someone to team with in order to conquer the monsters on your<br>level.<br><br>Other features at Anarchy Online Vault will include game information, news,<br>message boards, concept art, screenshots, humor, reader and community<br>participation features, humor and much more.  New content will begin to<br>appear in the very near future.<br><br>In advance of the activity that is sure to begin with Funcom's showing of<br>Anarchy Online at E3, we invite the online gaming community stop in at our<br>brand new Anarchy Online Vault where the excitement will be centered.  Enjoy!

Electronic Entertainment Expo, otherwise known as e3, is just days away.

I'm also interested in checking out single player RPGs and RTSs, as well as any other hot new technology.</UL>The IGN Vault will of course be sending several staff members to cover all the action.

The refined and cultured blokes who run Voodoo Extreme just kicked up a brand <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/games/interviews/Hook_interview.html">new interview wtih Brian Hook</a>.  Brian, as many of you know, left iD Software last year to join the Verant Interactive team.  Here's an excerpt:<UL><b>Voodoo Extreme: First off, what are you working on these days?  Can you talk about your role at Verant and what kind of stuff you do on a day to day basis?  What's your team like?<P></b>Hook:  I'm currently working with over a half-dozen other programmers here on our next generation RPG technology (which is going to be used by Star Wars Online and other products).  This covers graphics, sound, networking, GUI, AI, scripting, you name it.  It's a very talented staff.</UL>

Gordon made a few posts today on the Gameplay Board.

Peoples account status is only discussed directly with them. If the owner of the account would like to contact the head GM at <a href="mailto:lcarrick@verant.com">lcarrick@verant.com</a>, his questions will be answered.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037326.html"><b>Questions for Gordon</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1) If the Firey Avenger is the only 2hs that will allow a player to bash while it is equipped, why can a stupid little skeleton with a rusty 2hs bash?]</i><P> NPCs are not bound by the same rules as player characters. They can bash/backstab without weapons, they don't take damage from falling, they don't require air, and their spells don't use components. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 2) If all of us players would be upset when all of a sudden a dual-wield capable Mobs did dual-wield, why were all the weapons removed from the dual-wielding Mobs?]</i><P> I'm not quite sure that I understand this question. Many NPCs carry weapons. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 3) If a Ranger is a hybrid of a Warrior and a Druid, why does the Ranger track at level 1 and the Druid at 20?]</i><P> Class perk. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Why is the Ranger the only hybrid that retains dual-wield and kick?]</i><P> Another class perk. Rangers have melee skills nearly equaling the warrior, and in return give up heavy armor and hit points. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 5) Back to number 1, how can a dual-wielding Ranger NPC bash?]</i><P> See number 1 :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037343.html"><b>Canadian @Home Problems</b></a><br>I've received a few emails from a Videon customer in Canada who's getting timed out by a router in New York every minute or so for about 30 seconds, I assume that this is the same problem. At this point, my understanding is that the responsbile parties haven't acknowledged responsibility for the issue yet. <P>Web users wouldn't really notice this timeout which is why I suspect that there haven't been too many complaints. Real-time games are another matter. I would suggest that Canadian customers having this problem be very firm with their ISPs on the issue. </UL>

Both have been extremely well done, and both exhibit an intellegence and creativity that your past work didn't even hint at. The new kunark zones and the amazing capabilities of characters past level 50 make the rest of the game pale in comparison.<br><br>Now we've gotten to the subject of my post: What about the rest of the game? Kunark is stunning but there are still zones in the "old game" that aren't even near fully utilized.<br><br>Will work on the "old game" be abandoned in favor of doting on the new and expensive-to-create Kunark?<br><br>Will we ever see graphical enhancements to the "old game" to bring it at least a little more in-line with the current majesty of Kunark? Will "The Hole" ever open!? Will Odus ever be worth going to? Will NPC's which previously just stood around (and there are a lot of them - the majority in fact) saying nothing when you hailed them ever start saying things?<br><br>Will the "Old Game" ever be more polished than it is now, or will you neglect it in favor of your pretty, new Kunark?<br><br><br><b><i>Faxor, <br><br>First, thanks for the compliments -- Kunark was an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and do better. And in the future, we'll top Kunark <br><br>Now, to your questions.<br><br>1. No, we will not be updating the graphics on the old zones. This is primarily for two reasons: a. Resources are limited and I really think most of our customers would rather see new content as opposed to re-doing older content, and b., as was mentioned in this thread, it's not really appropriate to change the system requirements on the existing lands, which upgrading the graphics significantly would. That said, we have at least one minor way we're going to be upgrading the original world soon.<br><br>2. The 'old game' will definitely NOT be abandoned. The EQ Live team will continue to address crowding issues by revamping the lesser used dungeons and other zones. In addition, many of the zone mechanics that are being tried in Kunark, should they prove successful, will be used in the older zones when they are revamped as well.<br><br>3. The Hole is still on target for May, probably late May. After the Hole comes the Warrens, which is also on Odus. And we will continue to add free zones after that.<br><br>4. Yes, I think slowly but surely existing NPCs will be made more interesting, possibly involved in quests and storylines.<br><br>Hope that helps,<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>

Gordon was up all night (and morning) making even more posts on the Gameplay Board.  Here's quotes and excerpts from all his latest:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036316-2.html"><b>Where's the music in Kunark?</b></a><br>We're looking into this. We'll probably patch some .xmi's to the missing zones soon. They'll be pretty simple, just getting combat/underwater/boat music to work. Perhaps we can also customize some of them for some situational music. We are however limited to the music already in game.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037145.html"><b>More on Recent Spoiler Split</b></a><br>Actually, over 1000 people from each server were moved. However, when we publish that we are taking registrations, invariably people who don't play at peak ask to be moved, as do people who have multiple accounts. Unfortunately, there's no magic way to determine what percentage of those moved represent peak usage. Population on Veeshan rose to 2800 at the time that we opened registrations, so it's quite evident that many of those who were running the command were not peak users. <P>We'll give it a few more days to stabalize and then may consider moving some more.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037190.html"><b>The Tireless Gordon Wrinn</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Man, it's 3 AM and you just posted a response to my "where's the music?" post and some others! What the heck are you doing up so late anyway?]</i> <P> Just can't drag myself away :)  Actually I logged on to find that music post as I meant to get to it earlier, and figured I'd get to a couple of others while I was here. <P><i>[Quote from original post: BTW, has that guy that's dedicated to fixing the EAX SBLive! bug given you any progress reports? Switching my hardware settings is getting irritating.]</i><P> Yes, he's still working, pretty much exclusively on sound issues. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Oh, and next time you see him, remind GZ that expansion is out so he can go ahead and take a second look at that Bard Lullaby 95% resist rate issue when he feels up to it.]</i><P> I'll do that. As I recall he's got a couple of things that he said he'd check post expansion :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037193.html"><b>It seems unfair that some are still bound in Timerous</b></a><br>Changing bind spot of characters outside the scope of doing it in game really isn't feasible. In any case, I don't think that there's enough people bound there for it too be too big of an issue, and I highly suspect that people there will be changing their bind spots soon.</UL>

Mince sent me the following event announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Mince's Dungeon Crawls (Luclin server):  Runnyeye, May 3rd<br><br>Greetings adventurers, I am Mince, a proud Gnome Gemchopper and Nomad Lore guild officer.  I am of the opinion that many areas of Norrath, especially dungeons, are underutilized.  In order to promote these areas as well as the art of the Dungeon Crawl, I intend to periodically lead expeditions to these locales.  The last expedition to Befallen was a great success with over 40 participants combing the dungeon.  I am looking for hearty adventurers to join me in these expeditions.  Be forewarned that dungeons are dangerous and have their own unique challenges (i.e. locked doors, traps, large groups of monsters, etc.).  Also, it will be a Dungeon Crawl (meaning we will be moving from room to room, not camping in the same spot).  Therefore, power levelers, campers, and people that run at the first sign of danger may not find this experience to there liking.  However, for those who enjoy joining a band of adventurers and conquering a dungeon while focusing on fun, companionship, and defeating foul beasts, please come out and join me.  <br><br>Target:  Runnyeye Citadel, a goblin stronghold located between Misty Thicket and the Gorge.  It is a huge dungeon that I know very little about.  It contains hordes of goblins as well as some other exotic creatures like Evil Eyes and Gelatinous Cubes.<br>Level range:  15-30th.  Groups will be formed the day of the event.  Rough group ranges will be 15-20, 21-25, and 26-30. <br>Rallying point/time:  The Wall in Misty Thicket at 8 pm Pacific time (Wednesday, May 3rd).  Please be geared up and ready to go.  It is encouraged that you bind yourself in Rivervale beforehand.  The dungeon is roughly 1 minute travel time from the rallying point.<br><br>Any questions?  Contact <a href="mailto:mince@luclin.com">mince@luclin.com</a> or Mince in-game.  And be on the lookout for future Mince's Dungeon Crawls in the weeks and months to come.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

GameProWorld has published two EverQuest articles on their site.  The first is a <a href="http://www.gameproworld.com/gpw/pc/article/0,1579,5381,00.html">review of the expansion</a>.  Kunark is given a 5.0 on the fun scale and ends on this note:<UL>Fans of EverQuest probably already have Ruins of Kunark, simply because it's more fuel for their obsession. If you've ever thought of coming to visit Norrath for the first time, now's a great time. If Ruins of Kunark is any example of what Verant can do, then EQ fans should have a lot to look forward to in EverQuest's future. </UL>The second feature is titled <a href="http://www.gameproworld.com/gpw/pc/article/0,1579,5367,00.html">EverQuest: Year One</a>.  This article takes a look at the past year in EverQuest's history.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>After a year of release, EverQuest is still going strong, with 31 servers, each holding around 1500-2000 players at peak times. As long as Verant continues to support its baby with updates, improvements, and new challenges, PC gamers all over the world will continue to lose sleep and tie up their modem lines in the interest of saving the blighted world of Norrath. </UL>Thanks Jay!

Here's the Late Night Edition of the Gordon Infobits for your reading pleasure:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037069.html"><b>Posion Update..sorta</b></a><br>In cases where we have a firm date, we don't have any problem giving them. Unfortunately this is not one of those times, and I would just be making things up if I gave you one. I can say that the chances of getting it done before the end of the month of May is slim but possible. The month of June is looking better.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037072.html"><b>Player Events</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I've been thinking, about creating a tounament, a fighting tournament. Once a month earth time, with 6 divisions, one for each level group and class. Only natives to that city may participate. With great prizes for the winners. Held in the city's arena.(Pvp area) Would this be a good idea? Would many people come? What do you think?]</i><P> Well we've appoited someone to coordinate events. Soon we'll have an email address that you can send requests to for assistance. It should be pretty interesting.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037130.html"><b>Kunark Sounds Update</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I heard that the Kunark sounds will be added in a later patch. As of now, Iksar make no noise when they get hit, and everything else sounds like a human (goblins, skeletons...). Any ETA?]</i><P> Aiming for a week, perhaps two.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037030.html"><b>RoK Refund Confirmations</b></a><br>You will indeed receive a confirmation when your request is processed. We ask that everyone who's getting one hang tight, much of it has to be done manually since the request is filed through email.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037058.html"><b>Binding in Kunark</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: So what's the story with not being able to bind in the zone? Casters can bind in every zone except for one why? Magic barrier? Hole in the ozone layer? What?]</i><P> Actually, with Kunark, we implemented many zones that do not allow binding, dungeons espicially. As for not being allowed to bind in this zone, I think that even some of our bigger critics will agree that allowing binding in this zone created a bit of a balance issue. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037020.html"><b>NPC Binding</b></a><br>But on to your question, we've discussed the issue of NPCs binding recently. It's been a bit of a recurring topic, and we've firmly decided against allowing it. There are a number of reasons, only one of which is the economy of lower level casters. For example, we want to encourage people to meet each other, and giving everyone a reason to come to the cities is a good way to do that.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037023.html"><b>Server Status</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: just curios because the new servers don't show up on the eqvault or everlore evermon pages. it also shows veeshan and the other splitters went back online at the same time as the others]</i><P> Yep. The other web sites have to get their developers in to update their pages before the new servers will show. Saryrn and The Seventh Hammer are up.<P><b>Note from Aurum: We're working to see what the problem here is.  Whenever new servers are added our Server Scanner adds them automatically.</b><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037016.html"><b>No Prexus Split</b></a><br>The message on the scheduled downtime page that mentioned Prexus and a split was incorrect. It was supposed to say Bertox. As for whether or not Prexus will ever be split, it's too early to say for certian.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036968.html"><b>Ape Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why are all the Apes in burning woods Undead??  Shouldn't they be animals? They sure look very much alive.]</i><P> Just checked into this. They are indeed meant to be undead. The other live apes in the land are a little too evolved to be considered animals in EQ. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036805.html"><b>More on Veeshan's Peak</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: AT NO TIME SHOULD A PLAYER RUN THE RISK OF LOSEING EVERYTHING THEY OWN PERIOD. I can understand a risk of getting killed and loseing Exps if they want to do something make deaths in these zones no res so its a permant exp loss and they have to earn it back or put a delay in the cropse recovery time so that after 24 real hours your corpse will pop back to the zone line or to a safe room.]</i><P> A little bit of fear is a good thing. It keeps things exciting. If the thought of losing what's on your corpse is not palatable, the simplest suggestion would be to not put yourself in a situation where that could happen. This isn't a case where you risk everything you own, just everything that you choose to carry with you. <P><i>[Quote from original post: There is NO FUN in loseing a corpse ]</i><P>Perhaps not, however there is great fun being in a situation where you know that you could lose your corpse, and prevail. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033829.html"><b>Ninja Looting</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Ok I want ask you folks a question and I'd like you tell me what you think. Ninja looting is now forbidden.  What constitutes "Ninjalooting"?<P> Situation 1.)Lets say your in Oasis, your prowling around looking for DW crocs to kill. On the ground next to the lake is spectre corpse. There is noone around. You wait for a minute and still see noone. Or at least noone is medding nearby, no pc's are hovering nearby.<P>Is it ok to loot this corpse or should you let it rot? <P>Situation 2.)Your in freeport and run accross a dead guard. Again nooone is around. Is it ok to loot the corpse? <P>Situation 3.) your in a group killing orcs in crushbone. Noone moves to loot the fallen orcs. <P>How long do you wait until you loot them? <P>And do you folks leave groups with people who don't adhere to loot orders?<P>I don't mean to sound like some greedy SOB but this game requires money to play. My mage has expensive spells to buy, priest has spells AND money to buy, etc.But I want to be fair as well. And I don't want to be labaled as some evil ninjalooter. So I'm asking for advicee.. What do you folks think?]</i><P>Well, to be honest, all of these scenarios would have to be evaluated by the GM or Guide who's involved. I would say that one of the most common cases of ninjalooting I've heard is where a big group takes down some nasty critter. One guy is keeping the corpse open so no one loots, and when he stands up so that the lotto winner can loot, someone who's been madly right-clicking jumps in instead. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036583.html"><b>Factions in Kunark</b></a><br>The factions in Kunark are pretty complex, but it is as intended. The stronghold in the Overthere is filled with NPCs loyal to the same NPCs as those in Karnor. Players should seriously consider where they want to be faction-wise prior to killing anything that moves.</UL>All spotted on the Gameplay Board.
