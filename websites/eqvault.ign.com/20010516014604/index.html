Here are the latest information given by Alan from off of the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000134.html"><b>Flowing Thoughts</b></a><br>Let me start here with an apology. Someone pointed out that I was ranting a bit with my last post, and I was. I shouldn't be doing that. I apologize. <br><br>Aarreran-CrimRen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Even though I agree with you that Flowing Thought isn't a bad thing, I though I'd point out that you were dead wrong when you said... <br><br>"It only appears on items found in the Plane of Hate and are no drop. So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this."<br> <br>This is 100% incorrect. An item was found with Flowing Thought I on a Giant in Great Divide who was apart of the ring quest. Not only was an item with Flowing Thought I found on him, but an item with Flowing Thought II was found as well.]</i></font> <br><br>Yup, it seems to be the case that there are a few of the super high powered Flowing Thought II items available as well&#8230; <br><br>Flowing Thought II is, well, a little better than Flowing Thought. It is still far less useful than Clarity (though it might rival Breeze&#8230;), and it still stacks with all of those spells, so it's still not much of an issue. I would agree that an item better than that might be worthy of some concern, even if it does stack with Clarity. <br><br>And, as one reader has pointed out, there are in fact a few Clarity items in the game. <br><br>There are perhaps three items in the game that have the ability to cast Clarity II on their wielder (and only on the wielder). When I say three, I mean three total, across all the servers. These are, in fact, artifacts given out at two of the gatherings. As far as I know, no more of these items will ever come into the game (though I suppose they might, it's not part of any current plan, that's for sure). <br><br>Were these items dropping off any NPC in the game, no matter how rare, I would be concerned. But having three of them on all the servers should have absolutely no effect on the desire for enchanters or bards. <br><br>This one is kinda long, so I'm going to respond within the post. My comments are not bolded. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings Absor, <br><br>I was reading over the post you made regarding wizards and I had a couple comments. Forgive me but I dont know the codes for this board. <br><br>Absor said: "Wizards can't sustain their damage output in fights that last longer than those that existed before Velious. This is the issue you're heading at. And, sure, giving Wizards a larger mana pool or a form of massive mana regeneration would fix it. But it also makes them more efficient in all other forms of casting. " <br><br>Mostly true. The wizard community feels it doesn't do enough damage, which is our primary focus. You mention that giving us 'massive' mana regeneration would too greatly benefit our other casting abilities and you would have to compensate. <br><br>Raising mana cost of non-dmg spells seems reasonable given what a wizard is, dmg caster, but mana regeneration may not entirely be the solution. At least in my opinion it isn't because of other problems wizards experience: ie agro. I dont have a useable skill\spell to lower my agro so typical raid fights entail casting and waiting for melees to rebuild up agro for me to cast again. THIS is why mana regeneration isnt entirely the solution for wizards. It may help, but in raid scenarios wont solve our problems. <br><br>To put it simply, wizards have 2 problems:<br>1) Low dmg<br>2) High agro doing that dmg. ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, I don't agree that wizards have problem #1. Low damage needs to be qualified with a 'compared to', in other words 'Low damage when compared with what a rogue can do over the course of ten minutes of continuous fighting' or 'Low damage when compared to what any other class can do when dumping mana to finish something off'. I'd say yes to one and no to the other. The problem is that when you make comparisons like that it's all in the wording. <br><br>As for #2, well, no more aggro than anyone else that does the same damage in the same time frame. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Mana regen solves 1, but makes 2 worse. ]</i></font><br><br>If wizards could suddenly regenerate mana at ten times the rate they do now, they could control their aggro, and in fact aggro control would be the only limit on their damage potential. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Not true. Casters are just as AC and HP dependent as anyone else. It's just that their hit points come in the form of melee classes and pets, in much the same way that melee characters draw their hit points from healers and their speed from casters." <br><br>You should stress this more as it is the crux for grouping in EQ. Unfortunately, if any two of those become too strong the third isn't necessary. Velious fights last minutes and in that duration melee is the most effective damage source. In that context, healer-melee is the only dynamic that matters. Casters just are added to fill in the gaps if necessary. ]</i></font><br><br>Agreed. And this is the place where the imbalance exists. But people too easily forget that when you are comparing melee damage to caster damage, you have to keep in mind that there are two people doing that melee damage, the melee and the healer. Take away the healer and your melee isn't going to live long enough to outdamage the caster in question. <br><br>But it is this situation where the imbalance exists, and it is these situations that we are aiming to fix. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Heck, wizards have a great damage over time ratio and this isn't even something that we're looking at improving." ]</i></font> <br><br>This, to me, doesn't make much sense. You mentioned above it was something being considered as a result of Wizard Talk. So how can we have 'great damage over time ratio'? Maybe explaining your qualifications for this would make it clear because in nearly all raiding fights melees do more than me. <br><br>Perhaps we're thinking of different uses of the term 'damage over time'. A lot of the responses sent in were telling me that a melee character does a lot more damage over an hour than a wizard. That's probably true at the upper levels. But what about over the course of one minute? If an NPC is fleeing, who finishes it off? I was thinking of damage over time as it relates to most fights, not the rare long fight one can encounter in Velious, since I've covered that separately. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said RE dmg/mana: "Bane spells. Other than that, I don't know." <br><br>I am not sure if you know this Absor, maybe ask Poe about it for further detail, but banes have a very very select group of creatures it can hit. About 10 in game roughly I would guess can be hit by both banes. Being effective on about 10 mobs doesn't make us more attractive. Just means you CoH in the wizards when you are getting ready for the final boss NPC. You also have to be level 60 to use them. ]</i></font><br><br>I know exactly how the bane spells work. That 'select group of creatures' are exactly the creatures that take a long time to kill. They are the creatures where the wizard has the greatest problems, and is the exact group of combats that we wanted to target. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Isn't now, hasn't been in the past, probably won't be in the future. Just because you are the 'best' at travel does not mean that travel is what you do best." <br><br>Cool. <br><br>:)<br><br>-Alch ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, I've received a lot of comments that were much less&#8230; polite that Alch's comment. I'm not going to repost them here. But I'll address their concerns. <br><br>Too frequently folks get caught up in their current concern and don't step back to look at the big picture (I hate the phrase, someone get me a new one&#8230;). If we do something that allows Wizards to crank out the damage on high hit point NPCs in any way other than bane spells, then the life expectancy of old world NPCs would be nil. Improve the ratios of damage for Wizard spells to make them effective in the places where they feel weak now, and they destroy the old world with but a thought. <br><br>And I've noted that every (and I mean EVERY) person that has sent in some numbers showing how their wizard can't do the damage of a melee character sends in data comparing them to a rogue that has Ragebringer and is constantly backstabbing? Is that a good comparison? Keep in mind that the rogue is a three person damage dealer. He needs a tank and someone to heal that tank to do his damage. It might be fairer to add the damage dealt by all three of those people in a fight and divide by three, then compare&#8230; <br><br>The problem is that we're comparing melee and spell damage, and that's not a good comparison. The two are very different. <br><br>Group desirability is the other thing that is most mentioned about Wizards. They say they aren't. I argue that if there were no complaints about your ability to deal damage, then there would be no problem getting groups&#8230; But we also have plans that will dramatically reduce the problem with getting groups at higher levels. I can't tell you about it until we get it working and until we're done with the balancing stuff, but it will make a wizard desirable to groups. <br><br>I hate to say this, but it might be possible that part of the reason that a wizard might not be getting invited to groups is that you've spent so much time telling everyone how you aren't useful&#8230; It's hard to tell the sequence of events here, it's a chicken and the egg thing. But I often worry that this might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Tell enough people that you're not useful and they will believe you. <br><br>This may not be true, but I worry about it nonetheless. <br><br>I received and e-mail from a friend this morning, saying many of the things that many of you have said. He said something though, that struck a cord with me. He mentioned something about Wizards in literature and how they are something to be feared. <br><br>They sure are. But, well, Gandalf isn't a balanced character. He can't exist in Norrath because then there would be a majority of these literature-based character class and few of the others. Tolkien never needed to balance gameplay with Mithrandir in mind. We do. <br><br>I know that what I've been saying sounds like I don't understand your point of view. But my concern here is that you don't see mine. There is more to balancing a class than just turning up the damage volume until everyone that plays that class is happy. It's not that easy. <br><br>Keep sending in your comments, we'll read them all. But for now I'm not going to make more comments on balance issues until we're done with our run through of all the classes.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000112.html"><b>Special Food Items</b></a><br>Nynfolyn wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I may be mistaken, but so far I have been unable to eat any food by right-clicking on it if the food is in a bag.

The only faction hits for PvP on those servers will be killing a race in one of its home towns. No positive faction will be gained from PvP combat. <br><br>Unfortunately, giving anything positive at all for PvP combat tends to be abusable, since someone could simply have a friend create a character to kill to gain whatever benefit is given.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000162.html"><b>Travelers Boots</b></a><br>Saeul wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan: <br><br>You need to acknowledge the level of desparation that people feel regarding the Journeyman Boots and the Traveler's Boots. People have been frustrated beyond words at the additional barriers and frustration put in their way. You need to acknowledge it and explain WHY it's being done, not just say 'that is the way it is'. <br><br>It is NOT the way it is, it is the way Verant has DESIGNED it to be. Explain why. An explanation could go like this: <br>*beginning of one suggested dialog*<br>Folks I wanted to take a moment to have a short dialog with you on the Journeyman Boots/Traveler's Boots situation. We recognize that this one quest has continued to be a sore spot and we are taking an action that we hope will improve the situation. <br><br>On the one hand, it isn't fair to everyone who spent time and effort getting Journeyman Boots have their accomplishment trivialized. On the other hand, just money isn't, by itself, a sufficient 'effort' to replace the JBoots quest. So we made two decisions that you now see: <br><br>1. You must have faction to buy the boots. This affects those who hunted for Melatite, Charred Guardian Shields, etc. If you perceive your faction is SO BAD that you'll never qualify to buy the Traveler's Boots, then you are no worse off than you were--you can still do the Journeyman Boots quest. <br><br>2. You do not get as good of an item. The Traveler's Boots are somewhat inferior to the Journeyman Boots. This was intentional and is done to avoid the problem of trivializing other people's efforts. <br><br>In closing, I hope you see that we do care about our playerbase and we are trying to make the game more accessible without making it 'easy'. That is a difficult trade off and we're just people making tough decisions about how those trade offs work. Please allow us the latitude to come up with these ideas and try them out. <br><br>Trust us that we are trying really hard to keep the big picture in sight.<br><br>*end of suggested dialog*<br><br>Clearly this kind of discussion COULD cause more problems than it solves, but with your control of the message board, I doubt you'll actually find that negative of a response. ]</i></font><br><br>What he said&#8230; <br><br>Actually, that's pretty close to the truth. <br><br>Traveler's Boots are, however more than somewhat inferior to Journeyman's Boots. Because of the casting time they can not be used while moving. Because of that they won't be very useful as tools for kiting, and they will, primarily, be useful for travelling. <br><br>But most of what you say is true. I guess the problem here is that I thought those points were rather obvious (as they seem to be to you), so I didn't specify them very clearly. <br><br>And I don't think I ever said that they are as they are just because they are that way. I thought I was pretty clear that we put them there on purpose, not that they fell there by random chance. I'm not sure how you got the impression that I was even suggesting that they were placed in game by fate or some other such thing. No, we put them there and we did it on purpose. We thought out the ramifications and are content with them. <br><br>I'm sorry if I sounded equivocal about that, because we certainly are not. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Two more points: <br><br>3. Traveler's Boots aren't as desirable as Journeyman's Boots, since they have a casting time <br><br>4. For the price of Traveler's Boots, I could buy a *lot* of SoW potions. Suddenly the price of a SoW potion seems pretty reasonable to me... <br><br>-Azlina Crafte [Ebony Order]<br><br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks. <br><br>We understand the concern that some people have over the possibility of harm to the salability of Blood of Wolf potions. We don&#8217;t think that this will be a problem, we think that the sales of these potions might drop a little, but that they will still be valuable and salable. The truth is that nobody knows what will happen until it happens. So let's see how it goes.</UL>

It's this:<br><br>Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch. GMs will have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost. That means that they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one. It also means that I should remind everyone that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning.<br><br>So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch. We're not expecting a lot of corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of them disappearing.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Check out what Alan's been saying in today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000155.html"><b>Ragefire</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Once again, the point is missed. There is no complaint about the difficulty of the quest. The complaint is that a situation rife with conflict is created. Constant fighting over the Ragefire spawn is creating much conflicts between players and guilds. Some guilds have gone as far as assigning members time slots to continually camp the zone to alert the guild as to when the spawn is up and to shout out that they have the spawn camped. Since Verant refuses to regulate these types of actions in any way, naturally conflict arises when others try to come in to "take" the spawn. This is only one example of increased conflict and fighting in the game. The planes are another good example. Since the planes went to free for all, guilds are not fighting with each other over the boss and mini boss spawns, specifically in Hate and Fear. Verant needs to take a look at this closely and perhaps come up with some sort of plan to reduce this conflict. ]</i></font><br><br>I don't think I missed the point at all, though I readily admit that I might have. So I'll try again to explain myself. <br><br>What if Ragefire was to just appeared every 3 days right smack in the center of North Karana, at exactly the same time and in exactly the same place? Hand him the quest item and he hands you the epic and then goes away for 3 more days. No spawn timer issues, no trigger issues, just hand this guy an item every three days. Even if it was set up like that, there would be just as much controversy over him. <br><br>The problem here has very little to do with any of the spawn timers, spawn triggers, or any of that stuff. The problem is almost entirely caused by the volume of characters wanting to complete this epic. In the imaginary scenario above you would have just as many people waiting for the 3 day spawn, there would be just as much fighting over who should get to turn in their item to get the epic. You'd be just as frustrated as you are now. <br><br>The reason that the only suggestions that I have about fixing this issue seem negative is because they are. The only way to reduce the conflict here is to reduce the number of people clawing at each other to get this item. To do that we'd either have to make the quest a lot harder or make the item less desirable. I suppose the other solution is to let the item come into the game faster, but we're not going to do that. <br><br>I'm still willing to go back to the team and try to make the quest much harder all down the line. But most would consider that a nerf. And I suspect that even if it was a lot harder to do the quest, with all the desire for this item there would be just as many clerics lined up at whatever choke points there are fighting with each other over this thing. <br><br>I don't see that I'm missing anything here. 30 to 50 clerics and all of their friends fighting to get an item that can only come into the game so often is going to cause conflict.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000168.html"><b>Poll of Interest</b></a><br>Just passing this on.

But, well, in reality most of us want to be able to play those characters again some day. It's pretty unlikely that anyone would retire a character without some sort of fantastic reward. Fame would be good, but might not be enough. The idea of 'morphing' characters upon retirement would be pretty cool (retiring a character would open up a new class or race that can only be accessed this way), but would require a lot of creativity and balance and testing and all that, for a return that would only go to a few. <br><br>I really like the idea, but I'm not sure it's practical. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: NOOO BAD IDEAA!!!

My comments are the ones that are not bolded. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Regarding the balancing of Melee vs Caster Haste items, to rebut your arguments: <br><br>1. Most caster spells are offensive in nature, at least for certain classes. ]</i></font><br><br>I agree. For some classes a lot of spells are offensive. But only for some casters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. If a class has some utility spells to burn mana on as well, how does that make a mana regen spell more unbalancing?]</i></font> <br><br>Because they could cast more of those spells than they can currently. When looking for a solution for a specific problem, I want answers that only target that particular problem. Since even without reading further I know where you're headed, let's state the perceived problem. Wizards can't sustain their damage output in fights that last longer than those that existed before Velious. This is the issue you're heading at. And, sure, giving Wizards a larger mana pool or a form of massive mana regeneration would fix it. But it also makes them more efficient in all other forms of casting. To 'balance' that out, we'd have to increase the mana cost on all non-damage wizards spells. <br><br>I'd rather find a more specific solution. And the bane spells are a good solution. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. Casters are totally mana dependant, melees are not totally attack speed dependant (their HP/AC is as useful as their damage output in tank cases) ]</i></font><br><br>Not true. Casters are just as AC and HP dependent as anyone else. It's just that their hit points come in the form of melee classes and pets, in much the same way that melee characters draw their hit points from healers and their speed from casters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. So long as they stack w/ Bard/Chanter spells, they do not hurt the other classes. ]</i></font><br><br>Agreed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5. Flowing Thought I is so miniscule it's ridiculous... imagine a melee getting a drop from Cazic that gave +0.5% haste... ]</i></font><br><br>Also agreed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 6. If you're worried that giving us a decent mana regen item would make us too powerful when we have C2 in a group, that can be worked around while still allowing us to have some solo mana regen. ]</i></font><br><br>When did we ever identify a need for casters to be more able to solo? That's not a problem that we intend to address. A lack of ability to solo is not an issue that needs to be addressed <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Fact is, our mana regen is not sufficient for soloing in the high levels. It is somewhat acceptable in groups w/ C2. Give us a mana regen item effect that stops working when grouped or something. Or give us mana regen items that don't stack (effect overwritten by chanter/bard) and have lower regen than a Clarity of appropriate level (say for a Fear item, give us 1/2 to 3/4 of C2). ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, we could create some sort of mana regeneration thing that only works when in groups. In fact, we already have. They are called bards and enchanters (and sometimes necromancers). Hey, that kinda rhymes&#8230; <br><br>Again, increased mana regeneration is not a specific solution for any problem with any caster class that we've identified. You haven't identified one here either, except an inability to solo (which is NOT an issue for many classes, since many casters can solo very well). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: While I'm on this hotbutton Wizard topic - Wizards all over would really appreciate it if you would give some very straightforward yes/no type answers to the following questions, to help them decide whether to delete their account now or not, so stop beating around the bush... ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not beating around any bushes. I'm telling you what I've told you before, until we're done balancing things there is nothing to tell. But I'll give you several probably and maybe answers, if that helps. Just remember that until all the class balance issues are done, NONE of this is a promise. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 1 - Will our mana regen improve? ]</i></font><br><br>Probably not. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2 - Will our dmg/time improve? ]</i></font><br><br>Probably not. Heck, wizards have a great damage over time ratio and this isn't even something that we're looking at improving. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3 - Will our dmg/mana improve? ]</i></font><br><br>Bane spells. Other than that, I don't know. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4 - Is our single most primary attribute now "Masters of Transportation" for balancing purposes? ]</i></font><br><br>Isn't now, hasn't been in the past, probably won't be in the future. Just because you are the 'best' at travel does not mean that travel is what you do best. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5 - If the above isn't a clear yes, is Damage considered the top priority for us, or at least even with transport? ]</i></font><br><br>There is no 'top priority' for any class. That's very misleading question. <br><br>Let's look at another class, to help keep perspective. <br><br>When talking about balancing, let's say, Magicians, yes, the first thing we'll probably look at will be their pets. But will that be the 'priority' for balancing that class? Who knows. What we'll do is look at everything that the class can do, find the holes, and see if we want to fill them. If we do, then yes, it's likely we'll again look at pets for filling those holes. <br><br>But you can't fill damage dealing holes with teleportation spells (in much the same way that you don't use a broad thing like mana regeneration to fill damage dealing holes). <br><br>For some reason people think that we are using the new teleportation spells to as a balancing tool, despite the fact that I've mentioned that these spells are going in as part of a long term plan unrelated to class balance. Yes, we're including them in the package that is the wizard when we look at the class as a whole, but it's pretty silly to even suggest that we would use a teleportation spell to help wizards sustain their damage potential against high hit point NPCs&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Thanks,<br>Cabot of Tholuxe Paells ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, that was of topic and I ranted a bit to boot.

Even more reason for the other classes to think we really dont matter in the great scheme of things. <br><br>Your Humble Druid of the 54th season. <br><br>Eldriken ]</i></font><br><br>Two points. <br><br>One: Jboots are a lot slower than SoW.<br>Two: Tboots are exactly the same speed as Jboots. <br><br>This will not reduce the value of Spirit of Wolf or Spirit of Wolf potions much, if at all.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000116.html"><b>GM Events & Background Story</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "GM's need to be given a little more freedom to help players out that are working to create a story line. We all would have gladly agreed to not petition for help, corpse recovery or anything if the GM had been able to help us out. We were accepting a wild risk for some great fun. We belonged in Delnir. We were of the apropriate level and size, so we were not abusing the powers. It was clear to everyone including the GM's, but their hands were still tied." <br><br>Alan said:<br>"Unfortunately we just don't have one GM for every 6 players..." <br><br>What was tieing the GM's hands in this? I understand that Verant can't afford a group GM for everyone. But, in this case they seemed to have already gotten some of the GMs time. Why not a quick port to where they wanted to go? <br><br>Only reason I can think of is for fear they (the GM) were being set up. An easy way to the 'deep dungeon'. I think this area of 'GM powers' needs to be re-evaluated. They need to be given a freer hand. As a player, I would not have a problem with the GM or Verdant if some group cheated in this way. Who cares? They only cheat themselves. <br><br>Let the GM's do more 'fun' stuff, and less police work. One of the big 'hooks' when I started playing was the thought that it was possible to get into a mini-adventure run by a GM/Guide. This was the view of the players I started with (some time in 6'99). We all now know that it won't ever happen. The closest thing we've seen is a "GM event". We have even been part of a few, but only to the extent of fighting some gang of MoBs (werewolves in this case) on the other side of the zone from the "main" event. <br><br>Again, I understand the resource issue. My suggestion is re-weigh the resource usage balance. It needs to tip more in the "dynamic content" direction than it does currently is. I think the planed events are awesome, don't get me wrong. The story of Norrath needs to "move along". Situations like Ziff Harbinger's should be the result of "not any GMs available" rather than "We aren't allowed to do that." <br><br>-= Reptanis ]</i></font><br><br>Well, unfortunately, we always have to be aware of the possibility that someone is trying to scam us. We also have to be worried about looking as though we are playing favorites. I really hate that we have to do that, and that it restricts our activities when it comes to creativity. But in the reality of our situation we have little other choice. And that's why we have to say "No, we're not allowed to do that" to people some times. <br><br>And it's easy to suggest that GMs do less police work and more fun stuff. But they are doing the 'police work' because it needs to be done. How much fun would the game be if nobody was there to rescue your corpse from a bit of corpse-eating geometry? And as much as we don't like doing it, convincing players to behave themselves when needed is something we need to do. It makes the game more fun, really. <br><br>It might be interesting to have it so that someone can work with people all the time on their personalized quest ideas. And those quests would be a lot of fun. But when it was over, if the GMs were not doing what they do now, you're daily adventuring could very well be filled with nastiness and grief players (and, of course, corpse-eating walls and rocks and such&#8230;). <br><br>But we do have an events staff and our Quest Masters who are dedicated to providing more interactive content. Streamlining their tools and finding ways for them to 'do more with less' &#8211; as they used to tell us all the time in the Government &#8211; is something we work on, and something we want to put more effort into in the near future. <br><br>Oh, and I fixed the title by taking out the apostrophes. So don't think that I don't know that it should be "EverQuest's" and not "EverQuests"... I know, it's just that the apostrophe messes up some browsers. Silly HTML.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing For Experience, Not Loot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Camping in Lower Guk for a few hours is hardly any effort compared to a quest that takes a couple hours. The only difference is that camping in Lower Guk for a few hours is incredibly boring, however doing a quest for a a few hours is MUCH more enjoyable...at least for me anyway. It would be awesome if there were quests that yielded a full bubble (or at least a significant amount) of experience at higher levels. ]</i></font><br><br>Here is where I get somewhat confused. <br><br>For me, if doing something is fun, that's why I'll do it. If questing is more fun than camping, then why are people camping? <br><br>The only answer that I can think of is that some people get more fun out of gaining levels and items than they do out of playing the game. So that they will trade two hours of fun for two hours of something they are not enjoying and some experience and loot. <br><br>Knowing that doesn't, however, provide me with any insight that I didn't already have. It just serves to confuse me. <br><br>von_thorin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: In response to "Why not get a Yellow bub of exp for doing a quest" ... well ... Why Not? I clearly see your intend but don't understand the pause on a quest giving some non-trival amount of exp. <br><br>If a quest is build that requires: Hours of game time to complete, puzzles to figure out, spawn rates to deal with , possible trade skills, and other involved player (s) interaction to complete it ... Why can't the reward be Exp instead of some Phat Loot? <br><br>It seems that many are asking for just this type of quest. IE ... give me something to do that requires my mind, knowledge, ability, and possible team action ... over a game time period to gain exp. Knights of old were always sent out to deal with problems, issues, or other Mundane things (At least to them) to grow them in charactor and experience. Build the quest right and people will beg for more. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, here's the thing. <br><br>Fighting your way to the bottom of a dungeon re quires that you use your mind, that you have knowledge (at least on how to play your character in a tight combat), that you have ability and will require team action, and you will gain experience doing it. <br>And yet, very few people do it. <br><br>I would suggest that quests that require all the attributes that you suggest would be deemed too hard for the reward. Or if the reward was great enough to be 'worth all that trouble', then the reward would probably be overpowered&#8230; <br><br>I certainly agree that quests like those that you describe would be great. I'd love them. But they wouldn't reduce the number of people that sit on their butts at a spawn point and complain about how bored they are. <br><br>It would, though, thoroughly entertain those of us that like to be challenged. And that seems a noble goal. But making great quests takes a lot more time than making challenging NPCs to fight (heck, making a challenging NPC to fight might be just a small portion of a great quest). So we will always get more bang for our time making new NPCs than making new quests. <br><br>That doesn't mean making new and awesome quests isn't a goal. It's just that you might always see more combat stuff than you see new complicated quests over any given period of time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: you wanted to know things you could build quest around besides camping and tradeskills. <br><br>Faction (which could also be used to limit the number of times a quest is done...have completion of the quest faction you right out of quest faction, and no other way to alter that faction). <br><br>Then people have to build faction to do the (simple) quest. <br><br>Example, the Wizard recluse(like many), is a recluse. He is on his very own Wizard Recluse faction. He is convinced that he can make himself better using a formula of say....wasp venom sacks. Now, being a recluse, he won't talk to you unless you are warmly to him. <br><br>You get to warmly by killing drolvargs or perfoming various other quests (bring him various lore no drop items). <br><br>Once you complete the wasp venom quest, however, his project fails and he blames you for the problem. You go to dubious and can never raise above that status (or its a LOT of faction work). <br><br>just one example...I know there is at least one guy up there who is great with this quest stuff...look at the Rogue Ragebringer quest....this was REALLY well done. Its a nice story and everything. <br><br>Leirra ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, that's not far from the way some quests already work. It's also something that I've mentioned to a few team members&#8230; Great minds think alike. :)<br><br>We have several fantastic quest designers on the team. In fact, the whole team rocks at that sort of thing.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000161.html"><b>More Patch Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor,<br><br>I remember reading that when the faction change was to take place. The current faction would be reset also as well for players. My questions are, will this still be occuring? And if so will this effect any positive faction that has been gained? Such as building faction with the Iksars to be able to enter their city etc...If it does effect the faction that was gained. I personally (and probably many others)would not want it reset. As it took many days (real life), alot of money (hiring newbies) and caused near insanity building the faction. And to have all that lost to an update would be very frustrating. If you could shed some light on this issue, it would be appreciated. Otherwise I guess I will find out soon after the patch =). <br><br>Thanks,<br>Grim ]</i></font><br><br>We are still planning on setting up an 'amnesty period' of some sort, where people would be able to get their factions adjusted slightly to help reduce the past effects of faction loss for PvP combat. But it may be a little while. <br><br>The two ideas, reducing faction hits for PvP and trying to restore faction hits taken from PvP combat are linked, but they aren't really dependant on each other. They are linked by the change in ideology that faction hits are too much of a hindrance to PvP. But we had to change the way faction hits were being given out before we worried about redressing old PvP faction hits. <br><br>Right now we're still trying to figure out the best way to tackle that. We would like it to consume as little time as possible, both for players and for us. So we're going to take our time and find a solution that works well and simply. So it may be a little while (E3 is coming, and we're busy enough right now), but we still plan to do it. <br><br>And I doubt we'd be reducing factions, only raising them to adjust for faction hits taken during PvP (not for faction hits taken for other things).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000112.html"><b>Special Food Items</b></a><br>LadyMbc wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Uhm, you imply here that the only reason for right-click eating your food is to see the emote.

Darksome and Kryonis informed us of these events:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night in the castle of Mistmoore, 55 Half-Elf Ranger Darksome<br>Greyshadow and 55 Human Monk Kryonis Sougai were about to head out after a<br>brief argument with the cooks in the kitchen, but were met by a beautiful<br>Dark Elf lady named Khasra Vei`Ras. My trusty companion Kryonis greeted<br>her, and in difference to most other NPCs in this area, she actually spoke<br>back. We were quite surprised and a conversation started.<br><br>She welcomed us and informed us that she was the "keeper" of the castle<br>while her "master" was out. And that she meant us no harm, for if she did<br>we would be dead by now. Her reason for seeking us out, she said, was that<br>she was wondering if we knew anything about the chosen one (Firiona) and<br>why she was spotted in Lesser Faydark, and if these stories was indeed<br>true. It came around to one of us mentioning a unicorn and the story<br>progressed further.. After we were done talking she left and ordered a<br>messanger to be sent to the "master". We went out to look for clues and the<br>messenger but sadly could not find anything. Eventually we ended up in<br>Greater Faydark where she walking along the path close to Felwhite. We<br>watched her for a minute before she spotted one of us and another<br>conversation started. To sum it up, appearently she was once a high elf and<br>known as a "moon beast". The high priest ordered her to be slain due to her<br>being a moon beast. Her mother, scared for the Khasra's life took Khasra to<br>Lord Mayong Mistmoore to be "saved". However, she was not really saved, but<br>only imprisoned in death for eternity. She hates her foolish mother and<br>seems to want to be a high elf again. She also respects the high elves even<br>though they would kill her if her whereabouts be known. She feels she is<br>obligated to Lord Mistmoore and does what he asks. At the end of this<br>conversation she made us promise not to tell anyone (of course this was all<br>ingame). Darksome later received a "tell" from her stating that she was<br>once again safe within her lord's domains. <br><br>The important part of this event must be the messenger sent to her master,<br>to inform him of Firiona Vie's return and the possibility of the portal<br>opening for Tunare.<br><br>The (edited) log from this event plus screenshots (with the first part of<br>the conversation that is missing from the log) can be found here:<br><br><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~chief/vallis/khasra/">http://www.lysator.liu.se/~chief/vallis/khasra/</a><br><br>Fortune be with you,<br><br>Darksome Greyshadow    <br>55th Half-Elf Ranger    <br>Vallis Scortor          <br>Ayonae Ro               <br><br>Kryonis Sougai<br>55th Human Monk<br>Vallis Scortor<br>Ayonae Ro<br><br>Vallis Scortor - <a href="http://www.vallisscortor.com">http://www.vallisscortor.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
