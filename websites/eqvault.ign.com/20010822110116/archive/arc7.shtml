Maybe you can let him add humor to the sometimes hot issues that get people really hot under the collar at times, remind us this is a game to be played and ENJOYED, to have fun with not stress. <br><br>Again, I found this to be a "nice" addition to your comments Absor. ]</i></font><br><br>/em watches Mennix's head get bigger than it already is.<br>/em marvels that Mennix can still stand under the weight of it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Bah Mennix - while Halflings are certainly superior to the tall races (as are all shorts) they cannae hold a candle to Dwarves.

Not one. <br><br>At first I thought this new board would be a great way to avoid all the flames and such, but important issues are still being ignored. ]</i></font><br><br>Don't be frustrated. Every post is seen by me or by the team (or both). Responding to comments takes longer than reading them, and making certain that your comments are read is really the value of this new system. <br><br>In fact, let me respond to your question, to give you some sort of idea why I often don't reply to some sorts of comments (not because they are bad questions, mostly because I don't have good answers). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Last night a guild went to Fear Plane, we cleared golems dracoliche no problem, and began preparing for Cazic Thule. <br><br>We had *52* people, level 58+ with about 2 exceptions. With 5 level 60 Warriors and about 5 level 60 Clerics. <br><br>Charge - Die. We forgot to slow him. <br><br>Next attempt, we only sent in one or two groups and TWO level 60 shamans went OOM trying to slow a tashed/malosi'd/bardsonged CT. No longer slowable? No way, Verant wouldn't do that. <br><br>Next attempt, send in one or two groups and hit CT with every MR debuff possible..........both shamans OOM, not slowed. <br><br>Last try we decided he was unslowable and that he had obviously been upped in the patch. We got him to 15% by suiciding level 60 wizards and nothing. <br><br>Okay theres my story, I was just wondering if you could confirm this Absor or Abashi? If he is intentionally unslowable (he was slowable a week ago), this makes this mob 10X harder. ]</i></font><br><br>NPCs change all the time. We don't talk about such changes simply because we want you to expect NPCs to change. We aren't announcing changes that might raise Emperor Crush's hit points, we're not in the habit of announcing changes to Cazic either. Only in the case where the change is rather huge will be make an announcement about it. Revamping the whole zone needs to be announced. Changing some stats doesn't. <br><br>Honestly, we make far too many changes to NPCs to announce them all. Hopefully you understand why this isn't the kind of question I'll answer. <br><br>But the team did see it, I talked to them about it, and if this had been a bug or something, we would have dealt with it. So it is important to us that you send such comments in. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I send comments, idea's, and suggestions all the time but you seem to toss them aside. There a particular reason or are you only posting comments that say how great and wonderful everything is? <br><br>-{Run DMZ}- ]</i></font><br><br>You asked about more 'roleplaying' oriented events. The best response I can give to that is that we are working on more all the time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi Absor, <br><br>In the light of the log-in poll done a while ago, what update is there please on the possibility of a European Fan Faire? <br><br>Regards <br><br>Skruff ]</i></font><br><br>It's still possible. That's all I know&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well since ya asked... I sent you an email a while ago asking about the status of broken quests from Kunark... (i.e. Iksar SK Greenmist) <br><br>Many of us are well past frustruated that expansions keep coming out faster than you can fix old bugs... doesn't seem very fair. <br><br>Could you possibly give a list of quests that are currently being worked on so we could get an idea of when these will be fixed?\ <br><br>Thanks kindly. <br><br>Slimyface Thunderpants<br>51 Iksar Shadowknight<br>Xegony ]</i></font><br><br>We don't list out quests. They're for finding in game. And often the quests that people think are broken aren't broken, the spoiler site they are following lists the wrong information&#8230; <br><br>Broken quests and quests in progress are another category of questions that I'm generally not going to answer. As often as not I would essentially be giving out spoiler information in my response. Heck, just posting most questions would be a bit of a spoiler. <br><br>But I'll tell you that the Greenmist thing is on someone's plate. We'll get to it eventually, but other things are before it on the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well, I sent you a comment already, but you want to be flooed. *chuckles* <br><br>My suggestion was to have HP and Mana regen while offline. I'm not talking speedy regen here. I'm thinking along the lines of a full mana or HP bar in 24-48 hours. <br><br>This is not something that would unbalance anything that I can think of. And it wouldn't be a big boon to Hardcore players. But it would be a nice gesture for the people who have less time to play. <br><br>I feel that, assuming it can be coded relatively easily, this would be a great thing for literally thousands of players. <br><br>Eliathen<br>Terris-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>Nope. Not something we want to do. People would log out to avoid consequences and still be able to get to full mana and health. Get too far into a dangerous area? Used up all your mana to get there? Just pull the plug and come back a bit later. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: i quote the old fraise: carful you might get what you wish for. you might get flooded with too many comments than you can handle. <br><br>tristone vampiresong ]</i></font><br><br>I'd love that. While I'm certainly busy enough, I would rather be busy answering posts than writing server rules docs and stuff&#8230; <br><br>Buccaneer wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You might want to consider releasing some info on what the current "thinking" or "direction" VI is engaged in. Now that only selected responses are displayed, you don't have to be concerned with providin the fuel for negative posts. <br><br>I think most of us would prefer to be kept informed of the process as well as the resulting decisions. ]</i></font><br><br>We use the In Development and Producer's Letter for that sort of thing. I can certainly try to provide further insight on items brought up in either case, but when we have comments about our intentions and directions that aren't in direct response to a question asked here, that's where we'll put them. <br><br>If people want to ask questions like that I'd certainly try to answer them. But we also have to keep some sort of a lid on what we 'intend' to do. If we say we intend to try something, that sets up expectations that we 'will' do it. Until we're pretty sure we can do it, we'll usually hold off announcing a direction or intent. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I love the newspapers, and I'm betting others do too. You asked us about it, but I haven't seen any responses. What kind of feedback did you get on that? <br><br>Thanks,<br>-- Cragmyre ]</i></font><br><br>Basically we got a bunch of WOOT! <br><br>I'm never sure about posting a lot of positive comments because then I get criticized (as I was a few posts above) for trying to spin stuff. But I'll go post a few of them once I'm done with this bunch. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: OK you asked for more "original" questions, something that hasn't got a thing to do with "when will this happen?" or "what's this gonna be like?" and it just so happens I *have* one that fits your criteria. =) What is up with the mages' Monster Summoning spells? I can't nail down if you guys ever said what exactly kind of stuff it can summon, but I was told (and it can be logically deduced) that you can only summon creatures that spawn in that zone. This makes ottal sense from what we have been told by you guys about the "Global File" thingy that hold all models that can be displayed in a zone. So back o my question, why is it that it doesn't seem to be true? For instance, my wife is a lvl 43 mage so when we hunt together she likes to use the monster pets because they are more fun to look at and illicit some hilarious responses from other PCs. Well since the spell came out I have noticed that occasionally she gets a critter that doesn't even spawn close to that zone. Such as: a jungle spider summoned from EC, a fungus man summoned in Rathe Mountains, a spiderling summoned in Sol A, etc. Why are these critters in the zone file if they don't ever appear? Is it like some "reserved for future use" thing? I don't mind it I am just curious. I mean someone purposely put these things on the list, right? Seems like these critters could be taken out to make room for some of the other in-zone critters. Like why can you never summon a wurm pet in GD? or a Frost Giant? Being as the Moster Summoning spells are purely "fun" spells (ie-they offer no real tactical advantage), there's no harm in letting us know how it works right? Of course I can see some tactical advantage on PvP servers. I notice a lot of people will stop and try to attack the pet because they think it is attacking the mage. On PvP seems this'd be a great bait and switch tactic, let someone think they will get the killing blow and loot you only to find it was a trap... Anyhoo, if you could answer my question I'd be appreciative =0) Oh and can you please tell Dan to put in a recipe for Malted Milk Balls? We already have chocolate and malted milk, and it'd be really cool to be able to munch down on some =) Thanks! <br><br>Newander<br>Carnival of Carnage<br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br>Paragraphs! Please! :)<br><br>Some zones have creatures in their files that never were used in the design of he zone itself. So while you might not have seen any Fungus Men in the Rathe Mountains, that doesn't mean that the model doesn't exist in the zone file. <br><br>Some creatures are purposefully excluded from the summoning list. I imagine that wurms and most giants are purposefully excluded. Some coolness has to be exclusive to the desingers&#8230; <br><br>I already sent the Malt Balls suggestion to Dan.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Deity Team Server Feedback</b></a><br>Well, unsurprisingly we've received a ton of messages about the new server and its rules. I'll try to tackle some of them (with some help&#8230;). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If the person you killed has no open inventory slots what happens then?

There is therefore a selection or two which may not make as much sense as we'd like, but we spent a great deal of time on it to see everything would work out more of less fairly. <br><br>- Gordon <br>---------------------------------------<br><br>Yup.

Bards can track. <br><br>- Gordon <br>---------------------------------------<br><br>Bards aren't the greatest trackers in the universe, but this situation is the best we could come up with.

Do you gain xp for killing a character when within the level limits. <br>2. Will the Newbie area Super-Guards remain as-is? <br>3. Is the 'Insignia' for 20+ level characters an actual inventory item that appears upon death? If so, what if the inventory is full? <br>4. Clarification request: Concerning PnP, if I understood right, training mobs on opponents is a legal tactic on Sullon Zek, so the old practice of training city guards on opponents is legal here? <br><br>That's all I can think of at the moment. Thank you for your attention. ]</i></font><br><br>---------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>1. No - No XP for PvP ever.<br>2. Yes - The PvE game will change as little as possible.<br>3. It will appear on your cursor - It's up to you to find a place for it in inventory.<br>4. Don't confuse "legal" with "not illegal". Legal means it's an endorsed tactic, whereas "not illegal" just means that we won't get involved in these player matters. I fully expect the player community to develop a set of their own accepted rules on the server. I expect to see all of the things that are currently "illegal" on the other servers become "frowned upon" by the players of Sullon Zek. It will just be up to you to enforce them, rather than our GM staff. <br><br>-Gordon <br>---------------------------------------<br><br>Gains for PvP activity are too easy to exploit.

No. We considered it but decided we didn't want to do too many things at once. Not to mention, there's a real question among the team as to how this would add to gameplay. We aren't sure it will.

No. There are more reasons than that for their removal. <br><br>-Gordon <br>---------------------------------------<br><br>And as an extension to Gordon's answer for number two, keep in mind that though we are adding experience loss for PvP on this server, we are still restricting that to 5 levels.

The Sullon Zek server, the first Deity Team server in EverQuest's history, was officially announced by Alan in a very big update on the Developer's Corner.  Here's the entire post:<UL>Hello everyone. I've got some news for you that I'm sure you'll like.<br><br>We plan to have the new PvP Deity Teams server up and running some time tomorrow. I also have the name of the new server and the basic rule set for you below.<br><br>What we'll be doing is putting the new server up as a Test server for a short while, a few weeks or it may only be a few days, depending on how things go. In order to play on the server during the testing period you'll have to log in using testeverquest.exe. At the end of the test period we will be wiping all characters from the new server in order to restart it as a Live server.<br><br>The server will be open to anyone that wants to help us test it. You'll have to understand that the standard Test Server disclaimers will apply (see the note below). And our Development Team and Testing Teams will be running around on the server. Please cooperate with them and don't bother them with requests. <br><br>Please use /bug to tell us about any bugs you find with the new rules and PvP code.<br><br>Remember, this is a Test server, and there is no promise of customer service.<br><br>Don't let any of that intimidate you if you want to test out the new rules once we get the server up. Just run testeverquest.exe and start up a character.<br><br>Anyway, on to the rules. This isn't necessarily a final list, we are still thinking of adding and modifying some rules. But this is a pretty good summary.<br><br>----<br><br>Welcome to Sullon Zek, the first Deity Team PvP server.<br><br><b>Important Notice:</b><i><br><br>This server will only be featured on the Test EQ Patch for some time for testing purposes. You will need to run testeverquest.exe to access this server. While this server is featured on the Test Patch, all the conditions that apply to the Test Server also apply to this server. There may be cases where the server comes down multiple times a day for updates. There is also a small chance of corpse or item loss. There will be very little to no initial customer service support. When testing of this server is complete and the server is ready to be introduced to the Live Servers, all characters will be wiped. Below are the new rules specific to this server. But also be aware that these rules may be changed as we feel the need to adjust them.</I><br><br><br>The Sullon Zek server is a new server with a new rule set. The rules for this server are very different than those on any other EverQuest server. In general the server is based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Tallon and Vallon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which god the character worships rather than the race of the character.<br><br>This document includes the PvP rules for Sullon Zek, and a list of the teams for the server. The 'teams' will be referred to as 'alliances' in this document, as they represent an alliance of the gods, rather than some sort of sports team&#8230;<br><br><br><b>Sullon Zek rules:</b><br><br>1. Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply.<br><br>2. Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to participate in PvP combat. The first time a character zones after gaining 6th level he or she will then become PvP enabled.<br><br>3. Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience.<br><br>4. Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse.<br><br>5. Players may only have one character at a time on this server. This means that you will have to delete the existing character in order to create a new one. Because we are introducing a new class and a new race with the release of Shadows of Luclin we plan to make allowances at that time for those that wish to explore these new characters.<br><br>6. Characters will not be able to group with anyone that is not on their Deity Team.<br><br>7. Characters will not be able to invite someone to join their guild that is not on their Deity Team.<br><br>8. Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players current level.<br><br>9. Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player characters.<br><br>10. /consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player characters. 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or 'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 5 levels.<br><br>11. /consider will also display a message indicating what team the target is on. Members of your own team will be displayed as an 'ally', members of another team will be shown as 'threateningly'.<br><br>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves (high elves, wood elves and half elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is not a dwarven home town.<br><br>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on these servers to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning on PvP servers. HOWEVER: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on PvP servers.<br><br>14. Beneficial effects can not be used on members of another team.<br><br>15. No character will be able to bind in dungeon zones.<br><br>16. Beneficial spells will not affect characters more than 20 levels lower than the spell level. Existing spell restrictions on spells over 50th level will supercede this rule.<br><br>17. There will be 'insignia' dropped on the corpses of characters over 20th level that are killed by another character. We plan to allow those to be turned in for a reward of some sort. What that reward will be is undetermined at this time, but we are leaning towards a team reward rather than a personal reward.<br><br><br><b>The 'Teams':</b><br><br>The Good Alliance consists of: Erollisi Marr, Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Quellious, Tunare <br>The Evil Alliance consists of: Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Rallos Zek<br>The Neutral Alliance consists of: Brell Serilis, Bristlebane, Karana, Prexus, Solusek Ro, The Tribunal, Veeshan.<br><br><br>There are no Agnostics on Sullon Zek. With the new influence of the gods, those that had not declared for one deity or another have been killed. Everyone now worships a deity, if not out of respect, love or fear of the god, then out of fear for their lives at the hands of fanatics.<br><br>Barbarian Shaman and Warriors can choose to worship Mithaniel Marr. Mithaniel Marr was unwilling to abandon all of the noble barbarians that served the good, and many declared themselves in favor of an alliance with Good.<br><br>Monks will be able to worship Veeshan. The Temple in Qeynos has discovered some ancient writings that opened up new avenues.<br><br>We will be including a method for the Good and Neutral teams to use Summon Corpse or something similar.<br><br>----<br><br>Alan</UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html">Click here</A> to journey to the update on the Dev Corner.

They<br>had the dragon beaten down, halfway to his death, but<br>the unexpected suddenly happened...<br> <br>The Sleeper awoke.<br> <br>As the army of Conquest was in the process of slaying the<br>Warder, The Sleeper proceeded to slay him outright, and<br>then began assaulting the members of Conquest.<br> <br>Conquest was eventually defeated, and were recuperating,<br>when the emissaries of the gods arrived, and stated :<br> <br>'Everyone that is in this zone, has a corpse in this zone,<br>or was involved in the invasion of this zone is receiving a<br>warning for Exploitation.'<br> <br>The guild was summarily summoned to the area known as<br>"Arena", and was told that everyone involved was being<br>suspended, and their guild disbanded.<br> <br>Suddenly, they found themselves removed from the world,<br>and could no longer inhabit the bodies they had worked<br>so hard on improving.<br> <br>You can find more news at:<br> <br><a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz">http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz</a><br> <br>- Vanamar Dz`Baernon, 51st Circle Elementalist<br>- Officer of Eternal Sinn, Lanys T`Vyl Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Brad McQuaid, on behalf of Sony, fired back with <a href="http://lumthemad.net/forums/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=comments&Number=14692&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=7&part=all&vc=1">an official statement</a> on Lum's forum.  Here's an excerpt from that post:<UL>On June 4th, 2001, SOE banned and/or suspended 28 players belonging to the guild Conquest. Plainly put, they were cheating, we observed them cheating, they knew they were cheating, they admitted they were cheating, and they got caught. <br><br>While SOE does not want to spoil the game by releasing full details of the cheats to all players, basically the 28 Conquest players were (among other things) purposely using world geometry, aspects of the hate list, the "z" coordinate and its nullification of NPC's ability to summon, and multiple atmospheres (e.g. water/land) to arrange dragon-type encounters so they could attack without getting hit back for the vast majority of the time that it took to kill the monster. In short, what they did was carefully orchestrate 100,000+ hps encounters so that, for 75% or more of the time that it took to kill the encounter, the monster got beaten on and was not able to fight back. </UL>As you know, I dislike tackling GM abuse stories on the frontpage because most the time we can never seem to get to the truth.  Keeping this in mind, I will not be covering this event any further <i>unless</I> something extremely important arises from this incident.  For readers who wish to find out more, this report has provided both sides of the story with links to find out more information from each source.

The latest updates from Alan can be read here in today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar Background</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Actually, the reason I always felt Iksar had shaman instead of clerics was because they were tradtionalists and really do not like change. While they are really no longer a "shamanistic" society, they still cling to their old religion and beliefs. Also, it seems they practice ancestral worship, which would mean communing with the spirits of their ancestors which would again encourage them not to make the change to clerics. <br><br>I have gatherd Iksar society is not chaotic at all, on the contrary it's very, very rigid and organized and fear driven. Do what your told or die sort of thing, and it's a very military like in structure. Your role is determined before you are born, you never question the mystics as they are the mouthpiece of Cazic-Thule and to question Cazic-Thule is to ensure your own death and also bring death to your fellows, as punishment for allowing you to question him. Which encourages them to actively try and destroy those who WOULD question Cazic-Thule, thus preventing any worship besides him. <br><br>Well, I'm really too tired to detail my other speculations about Iksar society and their religion, if you ever want to chat Absor just send me a tell, I greatly enjoy discussing the Iksar and everything about them. <br><br>Zildrax Shathrais<br>High-Mystic of Cazic-Thule<br>Morell Thule Server ]</i></font><br><br>That sounds like a good depiction of the Iksar. <br><br>As for the whole Cleric/Shaman thing, it is probably more accurate to describe their worship of Cazic-Thule as more spiritual, more objectified than, say, the way Dark Elves worship Innoruuk. A Dark Elf (if he was trying to be polite) might describe this kind of worship as unsophisticated. But that's not necessarily the case. It is, however, different and perhaps a little more primal. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hail Absor <br><br>Ripped straight from the everquest.com website, i have a piece of information that may shock and discredit you Absor! <br><br>/quote<br>evil hand of Innoruuk touched this land and spawned the Iksar, a powerful reptilian race<br>/quote <br><br>where did i find the pearl of knowledge? at this address:<br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/atlas/kunark.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/atlas/kunark.jsp</a> <br><br>Absor, Cazic-thule is a big jerk! he keeps stealing Innoruuks worshippers.. or perhaps he just intimidates them into worshipping him. I am such a good spin doctor i think i should be doing Absor's job, i may have answered my own question! ]</i></font><br><br>More likely, someone just wrote the wrong blurb for the map page&#8230; :)<br><br>I'll ask someone to look into it and maybe we can polish that pearl a bit.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000193.html"><b>Rallos Zek Faction Hits</b></a><br>Ok, I made an error. <br><br>The changes to faction hits for Rallos Zek will be going in with our next patch, not with this last one.

I always look forward to patch messages..go figure. Was the patch delayed or was it just to small to post the changes? <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Galadin Trenchant<br>42 Warrior]</i></font> <br><br>Sorry. There really was no patch message&#8230; Here's what's on the front page of everquest.com: <br><br>----------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Today's patch consisted only of server-side data, and does not contain anything that would normally be announced. <br>----------------------<br><br>That's pretty much it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000182.html"><b>Auto-play</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: There is actually a better way to turn off the auto-play (known to the windows operating system as Auto-insert notification) <br><br>-Right-click on My Computer and click Properties<br>-Click the Device Manager tab<br>-You should now see a listing for CD Rom with a plus sign to the left of it.

Alan gave us some new information concerning the upcoming patch on the Developer's Corner:<UL>When we patch tomorrow (6-5-01), we will be introducing code on Rallos Zek server that will result in faction hits similar to those on the team servers.<br><br>Killing a character in any of their races home town will cause you to take a faction hit. This counts for all home cities. So, if you kill a Human in any of the city zones of Qeynos (or Freeport, or Surefall Glade), you will suffer a faction hit, even if that Human was born in Freeport. All of Greater Faydark is the starting city for Wood Elves. There will also be faction hits for killing High Elves and Half-Elves in Greater Faydark. Killing an Erudite in either Paineel or Erudin will cause a faction hit.<br><br>Also, for those of you trying to start or complete quests for King Tormax, you need to know that we've made a change. You will now need to be in good standing with him in order to do his quests. In game terms, this means you will need to be at least amiable.<br><br>Alan</UL>Visit the update by following <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000193.html">this link</a>.

After a restful weekend, Alan returned to the Developers Corner with several new updates:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar and Religion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Okay, here's my question. It seems that the Iksar cannot be agnostic because they have a firm, unbending belief in Cazic-Thule. I can accept that. :-) But, it leaves me wondering why such a devout people have no clerics of their chosen deity. The Iksar society and history seems sophisticated enough to support clerics in their ranks, but yet they cannot follow that path. I was just wondering why that was. :-) <br><br>Kullom Faithforge<br>22nd Level Paladin of Brell<br>High Council of Faydwer<br>Erollisi Marr ]</i></font><br><br>Perhaps in their past, at the height of their society they could indeed be clerics, I don't know. But now, despite their past, the Iksar are indeed a relatively unsophisticated society currently.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000182.html"><b>Mcicontrol</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If you want to disable Auto Play (took me about an hour to figure this out.. not to mention a lot of ejecting/reinserting the CD) <br><br>Pasted directly from Windows help: <br><br>Double-click My Computer. <br>On the View menu, click Folder Options, and then click the File Types tab. <br>Click AudioCD, and then click Edit. <br>In Actions, click Play, and then click Set Default. <br>Notes <br>You can temporarily disable AutoPlay by pressing SHIFT while you insert an audio CD. <br>Repeating steps 1 through 4 enables AutoPlay again. <br><br>And there you have it. I hope this helps everyone! <br><br>(who knew windows help was actually *useful*! ) <br><br>Delphi ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the tips. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have to retract part of my post. <br><br>The back and forward will not work because extra variables are required, and the current implementaion of /mcicontrol will not allow for variables (or I jsut havn't figured out what the variable is...) <br><br>So... :)<br><br>Sorry! but I did put in disclaimers :)<br><br>Grimone, Tunare ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks again. I thought I had heard that you couldn't do that&#8230; <br><br>And we both put in disclaimers. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just some more info: <br><br>I've found that in game, to play a CD, you must type: <br><br>/mcicontrol open cdaudio<br>/mcicontrol play cdaudio <br><br>But if that CD finishes playing, before I can play another, I have to type: <br><br>/mcicontrol close cdaudio <br><br>And then open it again with a new CD in the drive. <br><br>This may be of some use to people, <br><br>Absydion Darkflame<br>48 Wizard [Silent Ascension]<br>Tarew Marr ]</i></font><br><br>The more tips the merrier, I always say. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If you play an MP3/CDA (CD Audio) track using this new-fangled mcicontrol thing, will it cancel any in-game noise? I'd hate to have to trade music for not hearing hill giant footsteps coming my way... <br><br>Asfaloth ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I think it plays along with the game sounds. So you still might not hear that hill giant&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000179.html"><b>PvP Patch Issues</b></a><br>Greyfin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As a melee I'm not thrilled with the pvp debuff rule change, but I'll not comment until I see how that effects gameplay... <br><br>However, I am concerned about "only the person who gets the killing-blow in PvP combat will have looting rights. We would prefer to implement some sort of "majority damage" logic however this should solve most of the issues associated with uninvolved players "ninja-looting" the loser in PvP encounters." <br><br>This means that my guildmates and my party members cannot protect me by looting me... This loss of protection seems to me to be an acceptable result to protect players from "ninja-looting" players. In 90 days played on RZ I've been pk'd at least a dozen times. Only once was I "ninja looted" and that player (ie a stranger) gave me back the item for a reward, but at least 6 or 7 times my party members have been able to "protect" me from my foe by looting me first.

Currently, a quest begins when you say a certain exact phrase to a NPC. I am sure that there are many interesting quests that are rarely embarked on because no one knows the exact words to trigger a response from the first NPC. <br><br>How about having some quests that find you? You have an NPC looking for a player character with appropriate characteristics that are needed for the quest. These could be based on a combination of class, level, race, faction, religion or location. For example, while running through the Karanas, an NPC farmer hails you and requests aid with a problem that has been vexing him. Another idea would be to have a representative of you deity appear and place a holy quest upon you. Etc... <br><br>By assigning quests this way, you add elements of spontaneity and unpredictability to your travels through Norath. This also makes sure that the player character has appropriate characteristics to make the quest challenging and the rewards worthwhile. <br><br>The caveat for this type of quest assignment is to keep it rare. You don't want NPC's pestering everyone who passes. This could be tied to a certain spawn. An NPC could spawn, look for an appropriate character for a while then de-spawn for another few days if no one matching is around.]</i></font> <br><br>I like this idea, but I see some problems with it. For example, what if the NPC seeks out people that don't want to do quests? What if he's pestering them when they are in the middle of a dangerous combat? <br><br>I do see some very interesting possibilities with this, though. I don't know how possible it is within the game itself, but you've certainly sparked some ideas there&#8230; :)<br><br>Thanks. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan, I'd like to add support to the cursed item suggestion. In every role plaing system I've encountered and in just about every major fantasy epic, there are items that are cursed ( or are inherently evil or ones that warp the bearer after a while). The classic one being the one ring in Lord of the rings. <br><br>I think it would be great to have the chance of picking up an item only to find that it is cursed and you can't get rid of it (except by a quest) and that it has a detrimental effect on the PC. <br><br>Some ideas - <br><br>1) the item would not be known to be cursed until picked up - until then it would look like any other variant of the item (this stops the cursed item being left lying around). <br><br>2) The cursed item cannot be dropped, traded or destroyed - it affects your mind and you don't want to part with it - or can't take it off. <br><br>3) The knowers of all things arcane (i.e. wizards) could have their identify spell improved to identify the curse on the item - and provide the answer on how to get rid of it via a quest. <br><br>4) cursed items of both good, evil and deity specific origins. <br><br>5) what is a curse for one person might just be an inconvenience for another and the bonus properties of the item might make it worth holding onto. <br><br>Side effects - <br><br>1) people will moan - change something and people will moan, change nothing and other people will moan - facts of life ! <br><br>2) But you've nerfed Item X !!! No, with maybe a 1 in 50 of Item X being cursed - you've got to be really unlucky to get one - you've stopped farming however ! <br><br>3) You provide more hooks into Noraths history <br><br>4) You give wizards another reason for people to search them out <br><br>5) you provide a huge number of potential quests <br><br>6) You give the programmers a headache to implement (but hey, if it was easy they wouldn't be in the job - I know I've been a coder myself :)) <br><br>Just some thoughts <br><br>Malathos<br>Wizard<br>Terris Thule ]</i></font><br><br>I'm certainly in favor of an idea like that. Rather than having such items be cursed versions of existing items, just have them be new items (though it might be more effective if that new item looked like an old on, and very rarely dropped in places where the old one could be found&#8230;). <br><br>Sure, it creates a ton of new quest ideas. But it's not as though there is a lack of such ideas. Though it's always nice to more ideas than you could possibly use.</UL>

Straight from the Developer's Corner is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000191.html"><b>Stacking Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I realise this may have been intentional as part of the patch but I just wanted to express my concern as part of the SK community. Before the last patch Speed of Shissar, from the Enchanter Epic, simply overwrote spells such as Shadow Vortex and Shroud of Pain. Shadow Vortex and Shroud of Pain are minor AC drains which are very commonly used on raids and in normal grouping situations to manage aggro. This is especially true when preparing to break Mez on a mob. <br><br>Since the latest patch Speed of Shissar will not land on me if I've used Shroud of Pain or Shadow Vortex or Shroud of Hate. Unless, of course, Speed of Shissar is cast upon me beforehand, then I can use Shadow Vortex, etc, until Shissar wears off at which point Shissar either has to be refreshed while the icon is flashing or I have to wait until these self-only drain spells wear off, they cannot be clicked off. <br><br>The previous effect of these spells being overwritten was easily acceptable. The AC benefit is not so much a concern really as 15 points or so of AC isn't that big a deal. The problem is that these spells cannot be used appropriately to manage aggro anymore. If I'm on a raid now I either have to get the enchanter to use an actual haste spell (other than the Augment line) costing them mana and not extending me the benefit of the added features of Shissar such as Agi bonus or endurance regeneration boost, or I have to totally forgo a very strong role that I play on raids in order to be able to have Speed of Shissar. <br><br>These spells don't afford a great personal benefit in the stats they provide. In fact most would argue that the benefit they provide in stats is quite inconsequential. The stats they provide have nothing to do with why we use them. We use them to push ourselves up on hate lists to keep mobs on us instead of our caster friends. Without the ability to do that, we lose out on a major role that we've lived with for quite some time. <br><br>Please review this stacking issue. This has taken away part of a shadow knight's usefullness on raids and for what? There is no logical reason these spells shouldn't stack, or at least have Shissar overwrite shadow vortex as it used to. I had an enchanter try to land Shissar on me 5 times last night before we figured out what was going on then had to switch to a significantly lower damage weapon combo to prevent having to ask for zing every 10 minutes all becouse I had to have a less beneficial version of haste cast on me due to these changes. <br><br>As a member of a class that has no role against true uber mobs, at all, I find it very unnerving to have one of our major roles against non-uber mobs striped out from under us. So please, shed some light on this issue and let the SK community know what you plan to do about it, if anything... <br><br>Vendric Ravenkrest<br>- 55 Tier'Dal Revenant of Hate ]</i></font><br><br>------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>The problem is how Speed of the Shissar is built in our spell database. This is the same problem that Call of Earth has. I'd like to be able to tell you "I'll move some stuff around and throw it up on test to see if it works" unfortunately I can't fix it right now. I've looked over the problems with speed of the Shissar a few dozen times. All I can really tell you is that a number of stacking complications we currently have should be rectified in the coming Months. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>------------------------------------------<br><br>:)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000188.html"><b>Epic Spell Message Not Epic Enough</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello!

The issue I have is with the message the spell gives when it is cast. <br><br>Manaskin, level 54 Spell. When cast it gives the following message: <br><br>Soandso's skin gleams with an incandescent glow. <br><br>Barrier of Force, Wizard Epic effect.

Why no quest for them? I understand from a point of roleplay, but it wouldn't be first time something is made and justified later just for the sake of balance. <br><br>The fact people choose agnostic for the advantages they get from it is not a good reason to not make them have items that are Agnostic only. I personnaly made my rogue long ago, 2 years ago actually, and when I choose to be agnostic, I didn't do it to get any advantage but because no god available to me were what I was looking for. Maybe some people take the path to Agnostic for advantage, but it is same with those taking gods sometimes, especially with the imbued armors now... Maybe more agnostics are that way because of advantages it brings, but I wouldn't bet on it. But it's not a reason to 'throw' us out of the quest train just for that reason. Some of us made that choice for non-advantage reasons. And what about monks human? Be a monk of quelious or else you are nothing? Honnestly, I don't think it's a good idea to not give us Agnostic specific quests. <br><br>Thanks for reading it, and please just don't forget us... <br><br>Samanea Nightwish<br>Rogue Barbarian 58<br>Agnostic<br>Solusek Ro server ]</i></font><br><br>Well, here's the thing. <br><br>The following is written without concern for roleplaying choices. Such choices should and will be made with consideration for consequences and benefits, but without concern for choosing the 'best' options. All I'm talking about are 'balance' things here. <br><br>Without any deity specific items or quests, the 'advantage' goes to the agnostic because they have a more neutral faction. There are no advantages to choosing a deity, only disadvantages (with the exception of the classes that require you to choose a deity to play the class). <br><br>For game balance, we had no intention of making agnostic the preferable choice when choosing a religion. I would even be bold enough to suggest that in the world of Norrath it would seem more appropriate for the majority of the population to worship deities. So it makes sense that there be some encouragement for people to choose to worship a deity rather than not. <br><br>In fact, the way I see an agnostic in Norrath, someone that chooses not to worship the gods would have a harder life than others. Why would a cleric want to bless someone that has purposefully chosen to thwart the gods by not worshipping them? Playing an agnostic would be something that I see as a brave non-conformist choice with a lot of risk with a reward that might only be personal satisfaction. <br><br>Of course, I love playing agnostic in such a situation. :)<br><br>So it's not a matter of being forgotten, it's more a matter of this is what we want to do. We'll keep the agnostic in mind, for certain, but the advantages to those of a religious nature are intentional.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000192.html"><b>Imbued Idols </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: While extremely overjoyed with the inclusion of Imbued Idols in the recent patch, I was disheartened to learn that they have no class listed in the class useable section.

You had to do some sort of a quest to have it removed. <br><br>It would be neat to see some items in EQ like that. Perhaps they have a good benefit too...say for example a ring that acts like a key to somewhere but changes the natural healing of your character so that you lose a hit point every tic until you do a quest to have it removed. <br><br>Some other ideas are a mask that changes your image to that of another race and you have to do a quest to have it removed. Or a belt that gives you a the ability to port out of a sticky situation (can only be used once) but the price to use it is a huge faction drop, until you complete a quest. <br><br>You could even make some ultra rare so that people would search them out just for the glory. <br><br>McCade ]</i></font><br><br>The sad (and funny) thing is that there are already some 'cursed' items in the game. Mostly high level sort of things, but they can be dropped. What happens with those items? People send me e-mail asking if they are broken and when are we going to fix them&#8230; <br><br>:)<br><br>I'm not too sure how well a cursed item that you can't drop would go over. There might be a large number of players out there that would be upset by such an item or curse. I'm not sure. But personally, I'm all in favor of it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000179.html"><b>On Latest Patch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: the 1.5 resist debuff was a bad idea. as a melee i use resist to help protect my self from the casters. its bad enough for meele casses with all the unresistable spells casters have and the eggshaped prumice nerf , but now Root ,snare, and blind spells can can stick now with 150+ resist. anyways befor you ruin pvp anymore how about telling or asking us what you going to change befor you put it live ]</i></font><br><br>Well, it's a fine line there. As it is now a melee character can make him or herself nearly immune to all enchanter spells with high resists (and high resists are probably much easier to get than they really should be). <br><br>If I were to take a poll on this change, I promise you I would get a yes from every caster and a no from every melee (as a rough generalization). I suspect I could simply count the number of each type of character on the server over level 40 or so and that would fairly approximate the results of a poll on the matter. <br><br>We've examined the numbers and looked at it carefully, and for now we're sticking with this change. It may indeed turn out to be too much of a change. It also may turn out to be too little of a change (as most enchanters would probably tell you). <br><br>Let's try this out. We're certainly not going to change this at all for a while, at least until we've all played with it some.</UL>

An addendum to the latest patch was added to the Patch Server yesterday:<UL>May 31st, 2:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*** Patch Addendum ***<br><br>This evening we put in another patch to correct some issues that arose with the patch yesterday.  The changes implemented include some that weren't announced previously:<br><br>- Resist-debuffs will do 1.5 times their normal value for PvP encounters.  In other words, if the spell did -60MR in PvP before, it does -90MR in PvP now.  PvE (combat versus NPCs) remains unaffected.<br>- Faction-loss for PvP kills on Vallon and Tallon now only occur against factions within the hometown of the person killed.  In other words, if you kill an Erudite in Erudin, you will only lose faction with the factions in Erudin, not the factions in Paineel.<br>- Turning in the Tomb of Order and Discord will have no effect on Vallon and Tallon.<br>- On all PvP servers, only the person who gets the killing-blow in PvP combat will have looting rights.  We would prefer to implement some sort of "majority damage" logic however this should solve most of the issues associated with uninvolved players "ninja-looting" the loser in PvP encounters.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Computer Games Online kicked up a <a href="http://www.cgonline.com/previews/everquest-01c-p1.html">new preview of the Shadows</a> of Luclin today.  The article goes over the basic information we already know, and only includes a few screenshots of the new Gnome models.  Here's a clip:  <UL>Unlike Scars of Velious, which was aimed at higher-level characters and often required larger scale raids (the final boss took 40 characters to kill), Luclin is designed for small parties and characters of all levels. Although producer Jeff Butler admits this will be the first feature to go if the team is pressed for time, they hope to add animals that can be ridden like horses into the game. Many of Luclin's improvements only apply to its 25 new zones. "We may improve the old world in the future," he says, "but we're not sure whether that's going to happen".</UL>The Shadows of Luclin is EverQuest's third expansion pack.

The <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/main/indev.jsp">In Development</a> section of EverQuest.com was updated yesterday:<UL><b>05/30/2001</b><br>With E3 out of the way and summer starting up here are the things we are currently working on that you can expect to see over the next few months:<br><UL><P><br><li><b>Loot rules in the Warrens:</b> We plan to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be eliminating several ways around the current "Trivial Combat Code" as well as looking at the problem of "spell twinking" in regards to the loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.<br><br><li><b>Stonebrunt Mountains:</b> The next "free" zone will be the Stonebrunt Mountains, which will be located off the Warrens. It will support a level range roughly equivalent to that in Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the zone sometime this summer.<br><br><li><b>Dungeon Touchups/Revamps:</b> We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons in the world. Our last patch included an updated Runnyeye complete with new monsters and treasures to be plundered. Next on the list is Permafrost Keep. Lady Vox has been in the mood to do some redecorating of her lair, which includes replacing some of her more lackwitted minions. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.<br><br><li><b>Big Changes Planned for PvP:</b> We've had a number of meetings lately to plan changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually be going up are still to be announced.<br><br><li><b>3D Engine Enhancements:</b> One of the first things up is the enhancement of the engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the "moving stair step" visual artifact that you see in distant places where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance will be greatly improved.<br><br><li><b>Deity Specific Quests:</b> We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in the works.<br><br><li><b>The History Unfolds:</b> Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history and the future of the world will be made known.<br><br><li><b>Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants:</b> We're going to continue adding more quests and flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races' territories.<br><br><li><b>New NPC Return Policy:</b> Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a mob and gotten the "Thank You!" message? We are currently working on a way for mobs to return any non-quest items back to the player who accidentally gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.<br><br><li><b>Class Balance Discussions:</b> Some recent changes have been introduced as a result of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback as we see fit.<br><br><li><b>But That Doesn't Make Sense!:</b> We on the EverQuest Team realize that with all the factions, plots, and quests in Norrath we end up with a few oversights that just don't make sense in the overall story of the world. And so, for the sake of being true to our world, we've decided to keep an eye out specifically for these things and make changes where necessary. The fact that you now have the option to quest for your Ghoulbane from a froglok paladin rather than just brutally murdering the poor chap is just one example of these changes with many more to come.<br><br><li><b>Guildwars:</b> We've noticed a huge lack in player participation of this feature due to a lot of bugs with it. Our hope is that by fixing these bugs and enhancing the system a bit more people might be interested in going to war with their local guilds. </UL><P><br><br>Stay tuned for more new info on what we are planning for this summer. Until then, happy hunting!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Snaring is a very useful debuff for both of those classes which becomes near useless in a large amount of velious encounters. ]</i></font><br><br>---------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I have removed Plague of Insects from test. Honestly I didn't feel the spell was needed. It was pretty ineffective and increasing it's effectiveness would have made it overpowered. <br><br>We gave Rangers Cinder Jolt to address their ability to survive encounters. A lot of high level encounters are designed to make snaring impossible/very hard. It is very doubtful we would put in a less resistible snare. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>---------------------------<br><br>I would venture to guess that it will be doubtful that anything will be added that is a less resistible version of an existing spell. Such things would only be added to address a specific need, as was done with Cinder Jolt. <br><br>And balancing such a spell is problematic, since it gets all the value of less resistibility along with whatever other effect it has. Too much effect and it's too powerful, too little and it's not good enough. There's far less room for error when balancing such a spell. And it would seem to me that unless such a spell were targeting a specific need it would be very hard to justify adding it. <br><br>But then, I'm not the spell guy. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000183.html"><b>Lull Wears Off</b></a><br>Vbcoder wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: It would be nice if the Lull line of spells gave a message when the effect wears off. ]</i></font><br><br>As is my duty, I now present you with a response: <br><br>---------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>GZ and I addressed this at the San Diego Fan Faire. These spells have pretty powerful effects, allowing the caster to get solo pulls and make encounters much easier.

Thanks! <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - Sewing Kits: No existing sewing kits are being changed with this patch. <br><br>This was not correct. The existing Large Sewing Kits were changed to Deluxe Sewing Kits. If it was just a name change this would be fine but they gained 1.0 weight. I had replaced all my 8 slot 3.0 weight backpacks with 10 slot 3.0 Large Sewing Kits when that change was made. Now I have gained a lot of unwanted weight. Existing sewing kits were changed. <br><br>Ostil ]</i></font><br><br>This was my mistake. I wrote that little bit of misinformation, and I'm sorry. <br><br>The intent of the change was to keep the ten slot kits so that people wouldn't lose things, but to make them less desirable for carrying things. The cleanest way to do that was to rename the old kits to deluxe (and increase their weight) and to make new large kits for sale on vendors. So the 10 slot ones can't be purchased anymore, and the 'large' kit is reduced to 8 slots. <br><br>It's the best way to do what we wanted to do. I just misunderstood what was going on when it was explained to me. I'm sorry about the error. This is the best solution in the long term, making player made bags more valuable than sewing kits (which was our intent when we started messing with this stuff in the first place). <br><br>Rokhound wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi, just a quick note to you about the increase of the Bard charm. Last night I tested it out and found we're back in business again. Thank you for the adjustment and I really appreciate Verant's sensitivity to the problem. It may be a little thing to some, but I really enjoyed charming and now can do it again. Sometimes with all the changes to make the game "fairer" it appears to pass the fustration point too much, changes like this put the fun back into the game and I appreciate your willingnes to adjust to players problems.

This would only be used by spell casters that can gate to begin with and it gives them the option of gating to the last two bind points.

Too bad so many players thought the same as well at that time :)<br><br>But with these changes, also came a few concerns, and I hope you can shed some light onto this. <br><br>- Broxx <br><br>One of the things we noticed was that the Evil Eyes were gone. Broxx was a named Evil Eye that we have killed some months ago, and he dropped a quest item, for the Staff of the Observers. Does Broxx still spawn?

Now this doesn't concern me directly, but these ONLY dropped in RunnyEye, and were essential for Halfling Cultural Tailoring. Now I spent more than an hour in RunnyEye yesterday, but I didn't see any Small Pieces drop. Do they still drop? If not, you just threw Halfling Cultural Tailoring out of the window.... ]</i></font><br><br>I guess we threw cultural tailoring out the window, somehow I missed the high quality ore loot table.

He dropped an item that is needed to get the Breastplate of the Constant from the Temple of Solusek Ro, a Cleric breastplate. Did the other Goblins leave him alone when they kicked out the original Goblins, and is he still swimming his rounds there?

Some folks are upset that we announced the change to Runnyeye, blaming the influx of high level characters into the zone on the fact that we mentioned it in the patch message. <br><br>Even if we had not announced the change, players would know about it. The flood of characters into the zone would have been the same, announced or not. The only difference, I suspect, is that now the flood of curious high level characters will happen all at once and then, hopefully, trail off to something like normal. <br><br>There is no preventing this effect. It happened in The Warrens, even with the ABF (which sounds a lot like some battle-hardened plastic product). <br><br>In any case, I've had the chance to peer at the zone as Kendrick was working on it.

In order to make the FBSS into the FFC you would need some non-nodrop item such made by a tradesperson then turn in the item to a quest NPC who does the actual tailoring of the FBSS to the FFC. Being that this would be such an intricate undertaking, no normal tailor would possible be able to perform such a feat anyway. Only someone who spent their time tailoring and nothing else, like hunting mobs and such that PCs do, could possibly have the skill to pull this off... NPC Tailors don't do much of anything BUT Tailor so it would make sense that they are REALLY good at it, moreso than your typical player who spends more time hunting to gather materials, gain xp, etc etc... <br><br>A very highly skilled player tailor could possess the skills to create one of the items needed to make the FFC though. <br><br>For example:<br>Eliandra Silkspinner tells you she can make a Fine Silk Fedora if she only had all the proper materials. She needs a Flowing Black Silk Sash for the hatband, 2 swatches of Purple Velvet for the hat itself, and a rare fedora pattern. <br><br>The swatches of Purple Velvet could involve multiple tradeskills if you so chose. Perhaps a Highly skilled tailor to make the Velvet swatches by combining 2 velvet pieces dropped off certain young unicorns with new horns with platinum threads. The velvet swatches would then need to be dyed using dye made by an alchemist/poison maker like the armor dyes. Then you'd have to obtain the rare fedora pattern by killing some other NPC, or perhaps that could be another quest in an of itself as well... In the end though, when you finally manage to gather up the 2 purple velvet swatches and the rare fedora pattern, you would turn them in along with your FBSS to the quest NPC who would tailor you a pimpin Purple Velvet Fedora which has the haste from the FBSS plus some other stats and is nodrop since it's quested! <br><br>Sure it'd be tough, but who wouldn't make the effort for a Purple Velvet Fedora?!?! Especially if you were to make an appropriate graphic for it hehe :)]</i></font><br><br>Ok, that makes sense. Not a bad idea. <br><br>And I think three other folks suggested the same thing. Thanks to all of you. I love the way these ideas come together. :)</UL>
