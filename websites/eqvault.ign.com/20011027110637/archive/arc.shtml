There are just too many situations that could make problematic for horses indoors, not the least of which might be stuffing the rider into the roof of a low ceiling. They will probably disappear when you zone into an indoor location. <br><br>When you die the horse will probably disappear. He will also probably disappear when you dismount, but you will indeed be able to dismount. You'll be able to 'call' your horse back when you need it (which will also cause you to mount the horse). <br><br>Palmetris wrote:<br> <br><b>I was just wondering if horses can be mounted anywhere in the world or just on Luclin. </b><br><br>If you purchase Shadows of Luclin then you will be able to ride your horse in any outdoor zone, old world or new. However, those that do not have Luclin and all the new graphics it includes (as well as those that own Shadows of Luclin but choose to disable the new graphics) will not see your horse.

I also wanted to respond to those that had thought that the horses in some of the earlier screen shots looked a little odd. We had noticed that and had fixed them up just about the time that those shots came out (remember, print magazines have to get these shots a while before the magazine hits the stands). I'm sure you'll be seeing more horse shots before too long, and you'll be able to see the difference. I must say, I was impressed with the very detailed diagram sent in detailing horse anatomy&#8230; I'm sorry that I can't find the diagram or the name of the person that sent it in.

It is very complicated and expensive to try to conform to the legal requirements for sweepstakes in all the different national and state jurisdictions.

GameSpyDaily.com has published a <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=2428">quick interview</a> with Brad McQuaid, former Executive Producer of EverQuest.  The following is an excerpt from the question askings whether the split was amicable  or not:<UL>I wish nothing but the best for SOE/Verant. It's just time for me to move on -- the last five years were probably the most amazing and rewarding in my life -- I accomplished many of my dreams. But now it's time to pursue other dreams... I apologize for being so vague, it's just that there are really so many options at this point that I'm a bit overwhelmed and need to take things day by day.</UL>Thanks Prophet!

A European server will soon be open for testing as <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000353.html">announced by Alan</a> on the Dev's Corner today:<UL>Here's a preview to the patch message for the loyal Dev Corner readers.<br><br>---<br><br>The new server is called Antonious Bayle (Beta UK) and is located in the United Kingdom. Because this is our first server to open up over seas, we want to test it out before we open it as a Live server.<br><br>The focus of testing for this server is the network connection, so we need to have a lot of people testing it out. Therefore we are opening up this Test server on our Live patcher. This means that you will be able to play on the new server as if it were a regular Live server; log in as you normally do and it will appear on the server list. But this is still a Test server. This means that all of the Test server rules apply to Antonious Bayle. We will be wiping characters when we take the server Live (which we hope to do in a few weeks). Let's repeat that for emphasis:<br><br>We will be wiping characters when we take the server Live (which we hope to do in a few weeks).<br><br>Keeping that in mind, we want to encourage you to log into the server and play for a while. We really want to see how it holds up under a full server load, and for that we need players logged in and playing. So please give it a try.<br><br>We're excited about this new server and the possibilities that it represents.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br>---<br><br>We expect to have the server up some time very soon, hopefully today.<br><br>Alan</UL>

The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000352.html">relaunch of the official EverQuest website</a> was the subject of one of Alan's latest posts:<UL>I'm sure by now you've already seen the revamp of EverQuest.com.<br><br>One of the things I do here is try to keep my nose into the web development for EverQuest.com. We have some very talented web people and some fantastic artists working on the site. I know this because they're smart enough to ignore most of my ideas&#8230; :)<br><br>We'd really like to get some of your comments and suggestions about the site. But before you send in your comments, let me try to explain what it is that the new site is designed to do and a little of the logic behind how we're trying to do it.<br><br>When someone hears about EverQuest from their friends and is curious to learn more about the game, the first thing they are most likely to do when they get to their computer is to type www.everquest.com into their browser. We want those new potential customers to be able to learn the basics about the game without the clutter and complication of the stuff that experienced players are interested in.<br><br>Those of you that post to and read the Developer's Corner are probably familiar with the old EverQuest.com. That site basically caters to the experienced player, it's where we talk about new features, gameplay and stuff like that. A lot of that information isn't really useful to a potential new customer. When I want to learn about a game, I want to see screenshots, I want to get a feel for it. That's what we're trying to achieve with EverQuest.com. I've read comments on the net suggesting that it is just a marketing site now. That's almost true. We certainly want it to be appealing to potential players without blasting them with complicated concepts like melee balance changes when they just want to see if they are interested in the game at all. We do indeed want to sell the game to potential players through EverQuest.com.<br><br>So we renamed the old EverQuest.com site, it is now EverQuest Live. For those of you that are experienced EverQuest players, EverQuest Live is probably the site you want to bookmark (<a href="http://www.everquestlive.com">www.everquestlive.com</a>).<br><br>We're not done fiddling with the web site. I guess with an ongoing project like EverQuest we'll probably never be done adding things to the site. The web development folks have some really great ideas for the future of the site. But before we roll forward with new changes, we'd like to hear your comments about the changes we just made. So please reply to this thread with any comments or suggestions and I'll make certain that the web team sees them.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Alan</UL>

If you are kind, compassionate, and helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.<br><br>If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be difficult at times.

The changes that took place Monday are still being talked about and clarified.  In the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000340.html">following excerpt</a> Alan addresses Aelfgar's concerns:<UL><b>I am still just a little confused... maybe you can clarify this. From what I have read, the change in resistance it two-fold: first, casters over 51 have a better chance of landing DD's on any mob; and second, certain high level mobs have either had their resistances lowered, or made more specific, so they will have high resistance to certain kinds of spells only... is that correct? If it is, I haven't really noticed the first change yet (dd's seem to be hitting Spiders in VL about the same (3/5th of the time full, 1/5 full resist, 1/5 partial resist), and Spirocs and Raptors in Timorous Deep seem to be on par with this too. I haven't had the chance to try out any uber mobs though... in the next couple of days I will have a chance to try it on Venril Sathir, though, hehe.<br><br>Aelfgar Raintree<br>Level 52 Channeler of Morrel-Thule</b><br><br>The reduced resistances will be more noticeable the higher level the NPC is. You might not see a dramatic change until you try out some of those 'uber' encounters. That's where the problem with resistances existed, not with the lower level NPCs.<br><br>I urge you all to read over the comments we've provided carefully before submitting questions. We tried very hard to explain all this as clearly as we can. The answers to most of the questions I am getting have been given already.<br><br>Alan</UL>
