Hot off the Gameplay Board, here's today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012092.html"><b>NPC Bards</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why don't NPC Bards use their songs?]</i></font> <br><br>There are targeting problem. NPC bards singing an offensive AoE song would also affect any other NPC in the area. In many cases, it would cause those other NPCs to turn on the NPC bard. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012083.html"><b>EQMail Bug Reports</b></a><br>The request for bug reports to EQMail and the award program only applies to Dupe Bugs. I don't expect it to be a very large volume at all. In fact, if the past two days are any indication, hardly any volume. <br><br>It won't take time away from helping with CS issues.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011949.html"><b>Follow-up to Discussion of the Week</b></a><br>I think that if anything, the thoughts presented supported my original post where I spoke about the diversity of EverQuests players, and the fact that many people see different things as fun. Some spoke, for instance, about trade skills being fun, while some others said specifically that they weren't fun. <br><br>The task before us is to provide more. More options. More content. More things to do. We need to provide as many avenues to fun as possible, without infringing on other players' idea of fun. For instance, there are those who find it fun to cause other players grief. We do not wish to support that playstyle. <br><br>EverQuest already has many avenues to fun available to the players, leaving it up to you to decide which avenues to take. We can always provide more, as long as those avenues do not cause other avenues to break down as mentioned above. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011904.html"><b>Water Races</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is already such a race in EQ: The Kedge.<br><br>Of course, They went extinct centuries ago.]</i></font> <br><br>Well not completely, as Phinegal somehow keeps rising from the dead. But they are huge anyway :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011897.html"><b>Balancing the Classes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You missed the point completely ! There is a huge amount of work that still needs to be done in balancing the classes.]</i></font> <br><br>That's certainly a valid opinion, but it remains an opinion. As I've mentioned before, regardless the status of the classes, and no matter what changes we make, there will always be people who have opinions regarding the relative power of the classes. The only way to avoid this would be to make all classes the same, at which point we wouldn't have a class-based system and thus the game wouldn't be EverQuest. <br><br>As you mentioned in your post, nothing is exactly black and white. The concept of balance fits this perfectly. Balance is not a point that we aim for, but a range. Some classes might be at the bottom of that range, other classes might be more towards the top. It could be said that we should keep making adjustments until everyone is in the middle, but it should be obvious to anyone looking at these boards that we're not going to get universal agreement regardless. <br><br>Right now our biggest concerns at higher levels is can you get a group. No class is so disadvantaged that they cannot get a group, providing that they've cultivated the friendships necessary to do so. Does this mean that a character that has soloed from 1 to a high level might not be able to get a group? Certainly, but that is OK. That is one of the prices of choosing to do nothing but solo. <br><br>I haven't yet heard from anyone who will say that they have a bunch of friends in game, yet all of them say "sorry dude, I can't group with [your class] any more." People choose their groups not only based upon a specific need, but based upon who is "cool" and whose company they enjoy. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011893.html"><b>Monk Speed</b></a><br>We'd decided long ago that a faster running speed wouldn't be a part of a class-specific skill, but would be handled via spells and such. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011888.html"><b>Age Matters?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am not bashing younger people with this comment. It is mostly the young that come up with innovative ideas. But without a certain degree of guidence from more experienced folks...innovation becomes idiocy.<br><br>I have said it before....I saw the clips from the EQ gathering...and from the look there is not one Verant VIP over 25.]</i></font> <br><br>Age isn't important. It's ability. That said, I'm not sure where you got the "25" figure, but a good number of people are over that age. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011828.html"><b>No Response Bias</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Some people on this board are using the posts of others to show how bad one thing or the other is. How many of us that read these boards and are somewhat happy with what Verant has released. It is time for our voices to be heard. Verant has released a good product. I am not saying that it is perfect because everything has room for improvement. I may just be feeling this way because I am in this profession as well and realize the amount of work that has to go into even some of the littlest of tasks. I just want to encourage everyone who is happy with what is happening with Everquest to start to post. You may start getting more if the programmers feel like the work is appreciated.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for the note doc, and you are correct in that the programmers enjoy feeling appreciated. I and everyone else wish that players would go on and on about things that please them, but understand that it is not exactly human nature to do so. <br><br>We're going to try again this Tuesday, with the implementation of another stunning UI enhancement, the biggest yet, care of Rowyl. I don't want to talk much about it yet until I'm sure that it will make that patch package, but it should be very well received.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011866.html"><b>Corpse Location</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. get someone and pay that person alot of money to help me find my body.<br>2. Lose my body (fat chance)<br>3. Attempt to locate a gm and ask for their assistance to locate and perhaps retrieve my body.]</i></font> <br><br>Don't forget bards, necros, and shadowknights. All three have the ability to locate your corpse, and necros can summon it if you can come up with the cash. <br><br>/loc is an extreme out-of-character tool that was left in game under some objections upon lauch. It wouldn't be appropriate to expand its use in this manner.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011874.html"><b>Memorized Spell Limit</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So, the question is why have only 8?]</i></font> <br><br>To inject the use of strategy into the spell memorization decision. <br><br>It also has the effect of creating risk since you could have the wrong spell lineup ready for an unexpected encounter. Better get someone to watch your back while you remem :)</UL>

From Brimstone:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings!<br><br>My name is Brimstone, a founder and member of the Lost Order of Akalabeth. Our<br>guild/monarch has been involved in online gaming for well over 4 years now,<br>and we have been happy to share various concepts/graphics/data with others in<br>the gaming community. Today, we would like to offer three new graphics that<br>guilds/clans and/or monarchs can use to display their "Alliances" with various<br>other online organizations. The images come in three flavors: Bronze (Basic<br>Alliance Relationship), Gold (Intermediate Alliance Relationship) and Platinum<br>(High Level Alliance). Each image features a 'text area' where guilds can type<br>the name of their allied guilds/clans/etc. <br><br>The graphics/icons are small in size (4k) and transparent as well. They will<br>look great on any guildsite with any background. It is our recommendation that<br>guilds make this "Allied Graphic" 'clickable' to the allied guild that you<br>specified in the graphic.<br><br>To make things easier for you, we included not only the .gif file<br>w/transparency, but we are also including the .psd file for those who have<br>Adobe Photoshop and/or Paint Shop Pro (or other applications). The PSD file<br>will allow you to make easier modifications to the Allied Graphic.<br>Additionally, once you create your text and effects on the PSD file, making<br>new allied graphics will be a snap.<br><br>To download the various images, simply head over to:<br><a href="http://www.gamecore.net/allied">http://www.gamecore.net/allied</a><br><br>If you would like to visit our Online Gaming Organization, please head to:<br><a href="http://www.lostorder.com.">http://www.lostorder.com.</a> If you have other ideas for shared graphics, let us<br>know on our forums and we will accomodate you - if possible.<br><br>Thank you for your time and support!<br><br>Brimstone of Akalabeth,<br>Founder, LOA<br>em: <a href="mailto:brimstone@lostorder.com">brimstone@lostorder.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Brad made some posts this afternoon on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the skinny:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012003.html"><b>Scars of Velious System Requirements</b></a><br>Same as ROK.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011813.html"><b>Give Verant a Break</b></a><br>Rayn-HoD, not to single you out too much, but enough with the baseless accusations and flames. Constructive criticism is fine, but we're not going to let the board incrementally slip into noise again. <br><br>Criticize Verant, the game, etc., but with a point. For example, asserting that we have a company motto that involves being out of touch while posting on a board put up by us is NOT constructive criticism and it's also pretty ludicrous. <br><br>Consider this a warning.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011943.html"><b>EQ and Competition</b></a><br>FYI, UO and AC have about half the MMORPG market right now and EQ the other half. <br><br>I'd certainly call that respectable competition. With all due respect, the assertion that we don't have competition and are some sort of monopoly is absurd. <br><br>Also, the 'wait until X comes out and you'll see' bit has so far failed to be in any way true in this industry. <br><br>When EQ was about to come out, some predicted UO's demise. When AC was about to come out, some predicted EQ's demise. It just didn't happen. EQ and UO are still going strong. <br><br>Why? First, all three are fine games that appeal to different playstyles. Secondly, the MMORPG gamespace is growing like crazy. More and more people are becoming aware of these games and interested every day. <br><br>Are you playing EQ because right now you think it's the best? I would certainly assume so. Will many of you leave if a game comes out that you like better? I'd certainly assume so -- heck, I would :)<br><br>That's the point of playing games -- to have fun and enjoy yourself. There's nothing wrong with choosing to play a game you enjoy the most. Perhaps you'll find that EQ remains your favorite, perhaps not. Perhaps competition will come out one day that you prefer, or perhaps you'll find one of Verants several new MMOGs more to your liking. And perhaps you'll stick with EQ until the very end (which, btw, we think is many years away) :)<br><br>In any case, go with what makes you happy -- life's too short to play something you don't enjoy.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012031.html"><b>Brad on Rangers</b></a><br>It is true that I've not played a high level ranger and thus my opinions are based on those of high level players here at work who either play a ranger or group with rangers.</UL>

In one of their most original and hilarious spoofs yet, SomethingAwful has published a spoof of the Magic: The Gathering genre of game cards called "Heroes of the Gaming World."  Verant was honored (heh) with a card of their own.  Check it out by following <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/features/heroes/card14.htm">this link</a>.<br><br>It's a great laugh!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Making a few late-night posts, Gordon Wrinn had the following to say in them:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801.html"><b>Bard Thread</b></a><br>I've noticed that we have about 15 different bard threads on the front page upset about today's conclusion of the lullaby issue. I am indeed sorry that everyone is upset, however I'll have to ask that you try to avoid making tons of posts on the same subject monopolizing the front page and try to restrict it to a thread or two. Feel free to use this one. <br><br>Secondly, I'll have to ask that everyone keep the message board rules in mind when posting, specifically those prohibiting profanity, personal attacks, and flames. There is no idea worth stating that requires the use of any of the above. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011782.html"><b>A Player-made Proposal: Gordon's Response</b></a><br>At some point we are going to have to stop making balance adjustments to classes and focus solely on content development. The problem is that many true problems have been solved over the past 9 months, and this has given the impression that we're out to enhance any class that can form a solid enough backing on the boards. <br><br>However, there remains the problem that no matter what we do or what enhancements we make, we'll never be able to get to the point that everyone is happy and doesn't come to the boards here to complain. <br><br>At some point, we'd cross a line where half of the people were complaining that the classes were too weak, while the other half would be complaining that they are too strong, and we'd end up upsetting someone any time a change was made. <br><br>That point has already been reached. Most of the complaints these days are along the lines of direct class-envy, where one class perceives that they are lesser to another. The problem is that that other class is perfectly happy with that perception. Fixing the first classes issue upsets the second class. <br><br>We saw that with warriors and monks in the narrowing of the damage gap from 50 to 60. Monks were happy outdamaging warriors by such a large margin once we put in the hand-to-hand speed bonuses. Warriors were quite upset about that. When we narrowed the gap from 50 to 60, warriors were satiated, and now monks are upset again. We could keep adjusting this gap until both classes are hitting for ice-comet damage every round, and we'd still never get it "quite right" in everyone's eyes. <br><br>Regarding your specific topic, I imagine that we could get more creative with the stats on items and create a set of armor. Of course, we have to prioritize between what is needed, and what is wanted. Druids for instance still don't have mid-level quest armor because it isn't needed. The same issue exists with monks and Kunark now. <br><br>We are doing one thing though: We're increasing the weight cap on monks in two steps: level 55 and 60. Initially we're testing 4wt at each step.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011774.html"><b>EverQuest Glitch or Worse?</b></a><br>About the only explanation I can think of for what you are describing is that you probably have a virus on your system. I'd run some virus-check software. Failing that, you should probably give tech support a ring again.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011652.html"><b>Monks</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Cmon and reply Abashi]</i></font> <br><br>Andy's post already covered it. Gloves can't have combat stats. Items with combat stats can't use the hand-to-hand skill. Yes, in retrospect it would have been nice to build this in from the begining, but it's not something that we can go back and change.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011623.html"><b>Surname Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Once you make lvl 20, can you legally take the surname of an npc in the game? I know you can't take both first and last name, but say for RPing reasons you wanted your character to be related to an npc? Is that legal according to the rules?]</i></font> <br><br>Unfortunately it's not as simple as a yes or no answer, and is more the subject of a judgement call on the part of the GM and the Senior Guides. For instance, I doubt that the surname "Irontoe" would be preferable, since the Irontoe brigade is a major part of EQ lore. Other names however may be more acceptable. <br><br>Contact your server GM should you have any concerns.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011638.html"><b>UI Improvement Idea</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I play an enchanter and one of the greatest difficulties I have is targetting the right MOB to mez. Would it be possible to make F8 (or some other way) cycle through all close-by Mobs if I press F8 more than once? Similar to F1-F1 to target your pet. F2-F2 should target the first party member's pet, but that's another request. Comments?]</i></font> <br><br>It's highly unlikely that we could implement this in a reasonable amount of time. It would require indexing of all creatures that are close enough, or on the current view screen, loading them into an array, and cycling the position of the array each time the button is pressed. The difficulty is that the array would have to be updated on each press to account for creatures that had entered or exited the range, making keeping a logical position in the array difficult. We could try going alphabetically based upon the true name of the NPC (a_moss_snake24) but it would still require loading NPCs into the "in range" list upon each press. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011488.html"><b>SKs and Summon Corpse</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, how come Shadowknights never get Summon Corpse?]</i></font><br><br>Simply, because we decided that it would be a necro only spell. The fact that paladins get a version of resurrection is another matter entirely.  </UL>

Gordon made several posts on a variety of subjects in today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011744.html"><b>Changes to Sony.com</b></a><br>I'm not sure. www.sony.com is controlled by Sony corporate. We're quite far removed from that division.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011743.html"><b>Upset Customers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I've been lurking here a while now and I have to admit that recently there seems to be a huge increase in the average level of player frustration with the game and Verant in general.]</i></font> <br><br>The number of daily posts total has been pretty much constant for 9 months now. My impression is that there's been a greater number of positive posts here on the board as of late. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So I am asking you, what do you think of all this? I can't imagine this recent rise in complaints has gone unnoticed. Is there any particular reason why so many decisions have been made lately which run contrary to popular opinion?]</i></font> <br><br>Just because so many decisions are being made. Any decision has the potential of being in accord with or contrary to public opinion. The Live team has been hard at work making a lot of changes to the game, so it's natural that a greater number of decisions would be contrary, just as a greater number of decisions are in accord with public opinion. <br><br>Please keep in mind how these boards work. People tend to voice dissatisfaction where they feel they will be heard. They are heard on this board. If you go look at Stratics or EQ Vaults forums, you'll see a far greater percentage of positive posts. <br><br>Also, people are far more likely to get worked up by something that annoys them than something they are pleased with. It's pure human nature. That doesn't make the complaints any more or less valid, but it does speak to the percentage of posts on the board. <br><br>I'd say about 75% of the threads started, perhaps more, are to voice dissatisfaction with some element of gameplay. That does not mean that 75% of players are unhappy with the game as a whole, nor does it mean that 75% of people have the same issues. It just means that of the people motovated to post in our forum where they have a good chance of being heard, 75% choose to use the forum to get a particular issue of theirs addressed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Customer satisfaction has been steadily falling off for quite a few months now.]</i></font> <br><br>I disagree. Evidence points to it going up quite well. How I measure customer satisfaction is by those who go out of their way to praise the game, the team, and the changes that are made. Emails and positive posts here on the boards are up dramatically. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011697.html"><b>A Small Favor</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Could you give EsterTheTester a small ring and let her know that resistance rates are based on player level NOT spell level?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually there are components of both depending on the spell. <br><br>Some spells are inherently more or less resistable than others. An example of this is the "Fear" series. The higher levels of the fear series are inherently less resistable. <br><br>Concerning caster level, it's not so much the casters level as it is the casters level versus the level of the target. Resistance values receive a modifier based on this difference. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you could let her know this it would really help with her testing of Lullabye for Bards.]</i></font> <br><br>The testing is complete, the game designers and programmers have been consulted, and results are in. I'm afraid that the bards will not like those results. We'll announce more later today.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011735.html"><b>More on Guide Bannings: Right or Wrong?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What *I* want is for Verant to do the decent thing and tell *her* why her player account was banned.]</i></font> <br><br>And we will, but that is not subject for discussion on the boards here. How we interact with the guide program is between us and the members of that program. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I would think that the player account being banned should be answered given that no "PLAYER" rules of conduct were broken... ]</i></font><br><br>People who become guides become subject to the guide rules of conduct in addition to those for the average player. Yes, this means that someone can lose their player account by virtue of something done as a guide.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011674.html"><b>Q&A</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. can you guys make it so when a necro/sk summons a pet in kunark the iksar skaleton shows, this is logical because they are summon creatures from the grave and you know what creatures live/die in kunark?? thats right, iksar ]</i></font><br><br>It's a nice idea, for those zones that contain the Iksar skeletal model. As this is a wishlist item (e.g. Something that's not needed and has no functional affect), it would be pretty low priority. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. I have one small problem with your logic, you said we keep on spinning when we get stunned because we cannot put any more commands into the server while stunned, then why dont we continue to run when we are stunned?]</i></font> <br><br>Running and turning are two different things. I doubt that anyone would want to risk running deeper into a dungeon when stunned, possibly pulling more NPCs. The continued turning makes sense though, since you are being knocked silly :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011651.html"><b>Guide's Personal Account Banned</b></a><br>This person's account status is between them and our customer service department. It's not appropriate subject-matter for the boards, let alone in three separate threads.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011309.html"><b>Imagine This</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The fact is, this is all a moot point. I doubt that anyone from Verant/SoE is going to come on here and divulge exact numbers. But the fact is, if it were economically feasible to put more GMs on (and they could find qualified personel), I don't doubt that they would. <br><br>Why? Because it would encourage game/brand loyalty. Verant is not trying to just be a one-trick pony; they want to continue to make MMORPGs, and the target audience, in general, are looking for a "dynamic" environment. That's what differentiates it from a single person game.]</i></font> <br><br>Very true, and I thank you for the vote of confidence. I can't exactly come post a balance sheet illustrating how everything breaks down, though I will address some of the estimates in Minder's post: <br><br>The estimate given for the per-server hardware cost is **far** too low, and there are 34 servers not 23. Furthermore, bandwidth is easily one of our biggest expenses. The "just for fun" number estimated would be mere pocket change compared to the actual number. For overhead, the prices for electricity just nearly tripled in San Diego due to "deregulation". I wouldn't be surprised if our electric bill runs nearly as much as our bandwidth bill. Then there's the matter of the building lease and the lease of office equipment. <br><br>Concerning employment, GMs aren't all that is necessary. There's GMs, Tech Support Reps, Customer Service Reps, and 24x7 operations personnel. Then there's the entire Live team, which is getting quite large. <br><br>That's just the biggest block of expenses associated with operating EQ. There are a number of other expenses and personnel (Sales and Marketing, PR, Legal, Test, Phones, Administrative Staff, etc.) that are also necessary for us to do business. <br><br>On top of that there is new development, which is not funded solely by store sales as Minder suggests. <br><br>Businesses are not formed with aspirations of stagnation. Regardless of these expenses, we are allowed to turn a profit, and do reinvest back into the business, <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011663.html"><b>Hacked</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In the interest of keeping the origional post short I will conclude with a plea to get Aystan restored]</i></font> <br><br>He'll have to contact our customer service department at <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a> and state his case there. The decision is up to our customer service department. <br><br>Personal security of the client system is the responsibility of each EverQuest subscriber. Giving out account info, or loading something on to your system that allows someone to "steal" your login info is ultimately that subscribers responsibility. <br><br>All we can really take into account is that someone, logged in to that account, did something that is considered against the rules.</UL>

Yakatizma made a very informative post on the Coalition of Tradesfolk Board regarding some smithing issues.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000333.html">complete post</a>:<UL><i>There are a lot of threads being posted on the topic of the cultural forges, racial armors, and magical armors that are currently on the test server. The new blacksmithing content is still being added to and altered on a daily basis, thus certain aspects of it will not be commented on until it goes live. I will however address some of the concerns that have been posted.<br><br><b>I. General Blacksmithing</b><br>Many new tools and materials are being introduced that will be used within the blacksmithing trade.<br>Many of the new general blacksmithing products are materials that will be in demand for other trade skills such as arrowheads for fletching, tools for tinkers, etc.<br><br><b>II. Chain Classes and Smithing Upgrades</b><br>Chainmail wearing classes are receiving upgrades as well as the plate wearing classes, including cultural chainmails and magical chainmails. Banded Armor is the standard blacksmithed chain class armor. The materials for banded are readily available and it has a broad market since it can be produced cheaply by all races and in sizes for all races.<br><br><b>III. Plate Classes and Smithing Upgrades</b><br>Plate wearing classes are finally receiving craftable plate, which can be produced in a variety of colors. In addition there will be craftable cultural plate armors. Fine Plate is the standard blacksmithed plate class armor. The materials are readily available, requiring only a little traveling and currency, and it has a broad market since any smith can produce it in a variety of colors and sizes for all races.<br><br><b>IV. Weapons and Smithing Upgrades</b><br>A wider variety of weapons will be capable of being smithed and cultural weapons will be introduced. Forged Weapons are the standard blacksmithed weapons. The materials are readily available and the weapons have a broad market since they can be produced cheaply by any smith for any race.<br><br><b>V. Shields and Smithing Upgrades</b><br>Forged Shields will be capable of being produced by blacksmiths. Cultural Shields will also be introduced. Forged Shields are the standard blacksmithed shields. The materials are readily available and the shields have a broad market since they can be produced cheaply by any smith in sizes for any race.<br><br><b>VI. Cultural Armors, Weapons, and Shields!</b><br>Rumors of these items have been causing quite a stir here on the Coalition of Tradesfolk board. The Cultural items are not profit making items for a smith. The materials are rare and expensive and the chance of failure to successfully craft a cultural item is high. In addition, the market for these items is very small being restricted to only a few races per culture. Obtaining your class specific quest armor is a cakewalk in comparison to obtaining smithed cultural armor. The primary purpose of the cultural smithing is to provide more cultural distinction to Everquest and enhance the role-playing environment.<br><br><b>Q: Are all races capable of wearing at least one of the cultural blacksmithed armors? </b><br>A: Yes<br><br><b>Are all races capable of forging at least one cultural blacksmithed armor?</b> <br>A: No<br><br><b>Q: Why Not?</b><br>A: Several reasons, most of which have been brought up by players on the Coalition of Tradesfolk board. The main reason is why I call it Cultural Smithing instead of Racial Smithing. I'll use dwarves as an example. Kaladim is a mining city and the best dwarven blacksmiths are revered as heroes. They are heroes because of their "unique" blacksmithing techniques and secrets that allows them to forge armor that no one else can, like the Bloodforge Armor that the dwarven npc's produce. Sharing those smithing secrets and techniques would greatly diminish their importance. Dwarven players who have a love of blacksmithing are simply now given the means to reach for and achieve that status "within" their culture, but crafting that ultimate suit of magical imbued dwarven brellium platemail is harder than any other quest that dwarven player can attempt.<br><br><b>Q: What races have their own Cultural Forges and who can wear the Armor they produce?</b><br>A: Dwarves can craft Brellium armor that can also be worn by Gnomes and Halflings.<br>High Elves can craft Mithril armor that can also be worn by Wood Elves and Half Elves.<br>Dark Elves can craft Adamantite armor that can also be worn by Half Elves.<br>Ogres can craft Adamantite armor that can also be worn by Trolls.<br>Humans can craft High Quality Ore armors that can also be worn by Barbarians, Erudites, and Half Elves.<br>Iksar can craft Skyiron armor that can only be worn by Iksars.<br>Barbarians culturally do not prefer plate armors but do have a chain class armor in addition to their line of weapons.<br>Gnomes have a forge that will be used in conjunction with tinkering to produce some gnome only cultural suits of armor.<br><br><b>Q: Will other races have cultural products produced by trade skills?</b><br>A: Yes. Erudite craftsmen are known for producing some of the finest robes and silks. Halflings are travelers and collectors; thus have a cultural demand for comfortable leathers and lightweight bags. Wood elves admire intricate leatherworking and Kelethin is home to Norraths finest fletchers. Iksars have an abundance of rich clay at their disposal and have a long history of crafting fine pottery, plus their claws are great for intricate etching. Trolls...well, trolls eat a lot.<br><br><b>Q: What about Half Elves?</b><br>A: Half Elves are a unique case. They have no culture of their own. The Half Elf advantage is that they can use more of the cultural items than any other race. Their disadvantage is that they have no cultural items of their own.</i></UL>

We'll mark your current account as free, or provide you with a new, free account, and b) Subject to approval by us, the title of your choice will be applied to one of the characters on your account.<br><br>To qualify, you must include all of the information below. Furthermore, THE REPRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE CLEAR, CONCISE, AND PRESENT LOGICAL STEPS ALLOWING OUR TEST DEPARTMENT TO REPRODUCE THE BUG. Send an email with a subject line of "Dupe Bug Report" to eqmail@verant.com containing the following:<br><br>1. Station Name<br>2. Real Name<br>3. Phone Number (Day and Evening)<br>4. Primary Play Server<br>5. Primary Character Name<br>6.

GameSpot UK published yet another <a href="http://video.gamespot.co.uk/ects2000/pc/news/0,12006,2625125,00.html">new "First Look" at the Scars of Velious</a>.  The big thing talked about is Velious' level range and new UI.  Here's a snippet:<UL>Specifically, a Verant spokesperson said one of the new features would be a new, fully customisable 3D user interface. Since EverQuest was released in early 1999, players have had to use a somewhat cumbersome and plain-looking, but nevertheless serviceable, graphical interface while playing the game. The new interface in Velious will be more customisable - for instance, you can create multiple chat windows, so you can isolate messages sent by your group or guild from other on-screen messages. You'll also have more control over the elements that appear on the screen and where they go. </UL>Thanks Laura!

Back again at the Gameplay Board, Brad made a few posts on a variety of subjects.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010994-2.html"><b>"A Storm Gathers..."</b></a><br>The Live team is focussing on the FA style quests now, and then will move on to some serious dungeon retuning. <br><br>How much time they allocate to Ranger tuning is up to Jeff and I know he's talked to Sunmoon about it. <br><br>Frankly, while I have a lot of respect for Sunmoon and his comitment to both EQ and the Ranger community, I found his post a bit shocking, especially since Jeff Butler called him personally on the phone and spent some time talking to him about issues. <br><br>With a subscriber base of 280k plus, I thought his call was a pretty good indicator that we're listening and considering issues and I'm disappointed to see such a rant :(<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011247.html"><b>More EQ Store "Updates"</b></a><br>Here's what I posted a couple of weeks ago (I'll post an update as soon as I get one): <br><br>Unfortunately, we're running at least a couple of weeks late. <br><br>We're still setting up proceedures with our distributor and tweaking things -- we REALLY want to do this right this time without any hitches. <br><br>That said, in my opinion it's taking too much time, and I apologize -- for what it's worth I'll do everything I can to accelerate the process. <br><br>-Brad <br><br>ps. the good news is that it's being set up so we can sell not just the Kunark upgrades but also t-shirts, hats, posters, figures, etc., which should IMHO be pretty cool.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011411.html"><b>Risk</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Long ago, in what seems like another life now, I was a young wood elf Rogue making my way through Cazic-Thule with a young high elf cleric and another wood elven rogue. We fought long and hard battles with the denizens of the inner courtyard of Cazic-Thule, sometimes, even poking our heads into the maze of Thule to try and pick off straggler Defenders and Warders. <br><br>At this time, the history of EQ had not yet been written. Uberguilds didn't exist, nor would they for another year. Life was a bit more simplistic then, there were still many, many unknowns. <br><br>My small group of friends were the only people of sufficient power at that time to even attempt a fearsome dungeon :)  like Cazic-Thule. We had advanced very rapidly and the Gods saw our powers growing. <br><br>One day while fighting in Cazic Thule, a mighty figure appeared out of thin air, wielding a great flaming sword. We knew of this person as Aradune, Avatar of the God Karana. He had appeared before us before, apparently checking up on us for his God, and to make sure we were still in good graces with our own Gods. <br><br>This day we spoke of many things... Aradune told us great stories of his times in another realm, long before Norrath or any of its denizens existed. He spoke boldly of his adventures that sprawled across the darkest regions of this other world. Proudly, he told us stories of his many accomplishments. We were all in awe, such courage was yet unknown in our realm. <br><br>Aradune then looked at us stearnly, pointing the flaming sword at each of us, and told us, 'Perhaps one day, if you risk your life and limb, and traverse the deepest regions of this realm, you will be rewarded. In the realms of Norrath, bravery, courage, honor, dedication, and belief are given the highest of rewards. Those willing to take the largest risks are rewarded justly.' <br><br>It was on that day that the charter of the Fires of Heaven was created. We would embody the qualities dictated to us by the Avatar of Karana. We would succeed where other mortal men had failed... the prophecy was written. <br>____________ <br>What happened Aradune? <br><br>When did camping Grup Keep with a group of 6 people equate to killing the dragon Trakanon with a group of 36, repeating this process until all players have teeth necessary for a long and arduous quest to complete a key to the house of Veeshan, THEN, to muster up the courage, tactics, and team necessary to take down the named denizens of the house of Veeshan, so that an item said Dragon dropped was more useless than the robe dropped off of Gruplinort? That a group of 3 people can camp the Sebilite Guardian to score a far superior weapon than several dropped off of Silverwing? or Hoshkar?]</i></font> <br><br>I think it's a combination of mistakes, our hestancy to 'nerf' to fix mistakes, and also the knowledge that other areas will most likely be upgraded in the future (for example, the planes vs. kunark loot issue). <br><br>Anyway, I stand by what I said to you back then, and I think overall it still holds true in this game. As evidence, I submit many complaints on this very board about the game being too hard, that it punishes casual gamers, etc. In other words, your concern that the best loot isn't necessarily always in the toughest dungeons is virtually drowned out by other players' concerns that good loot is only obtainable by ueber guilds in the depths of difficult dungeons after adventuring for hours and hours.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011085.html"><b>Velious Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I read the interview on Daily Radar (<a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_1402_1.html">http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_1402_1.html</a>) with Jeff and Brad (some cool screen shots btw), and Brad had this to say: <br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br>Velious will primarily be available in retail stores as its own SKU. It is not a stand-alone product and will require a previous installation of either EverQuest or EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark as well as an active account to play. The MSRP at this point is $19.95. As for the online store, we are still working on setting a new one up in conjunction with a major distributor.<br>------------------------------------------------- <br><br>My question is, if someone has the original non-RoK Everquest, and they purchase SoV, will they get the level cap increase to 60? Please excuse me if someone already asked this, just wondering....]</i></font><br><br>doh! That's a good question and definitely something we missed in the announcement. I'll make sure this is on the Velious FAQ -- thanks. <br><br>Yes, registering Velious will also allow you to exceed level 50 even if you didn't purchase/register Kunark.</UL>

Gordon continued today's posting spree by writing the following posts on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011263.html"><b>Alternate Line of TP Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This idea may have been throw out already. If so then my apologies.]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, this one has come up several times in the past few weeks. In short, that's not really what we had in mind for teleportation, and we do want there to be a sacrifice on the part of those who are performing teleports. <br><br>The other part is that we want wizards to encounter the same dangers as the person being ported. For instance, I could imagine that if we included this ability, we'd see a sharp rise in the number of people getting sent to Cazic-Thule. Sure, the easy way to fix *that* problem would be to put another confirmation box in, but the fact remains that it's not what we had in mind.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011431.html"><b>Resources</b></a><br>When you say "lag", are you speaking of a high ping, a low ping with delayed actions (e.g. Opening doors is delayed), or low framerate (e.g. sluggish mouse)? <br><br>The time in the morning that you suggest represents only about 25% of peak usage, which represents far less than that in total system resources.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011257.html"><b>Traveling and Binding</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1: Travel time]</i></font> <br><br>I guess it's a matter of personal preference, but people did state emphatically during EQ's design phase that they wanted a huge world, with very little instant travel. That's what we have here. There are ways in game for you to substantially reduce your travel time in the event that you A) play certain classes, or B) have cultivated the appropriate friendships. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2: Binding]</i></font> <br><br>We covered binding in the FAQ at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html</a> <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Try this on, every (or every other, enough so that you never have to cross more than one zone to get a corpse) non city zone has an npc who for a fee (not a cheap one, multiple pp) will bind you in that spot.]</i></font> <br><br>Binding services are not something that we would consider farming out to NPCs.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011249.html"><b>Revive and Ressurection</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I didn't notice it in a patch message but i also took a while off from eq, can you be revived and still get an exp res? i remember you saying they were working on it.]</i></font> <br><br>No, you cannot later get XP back if you've already accepted a Revive. The change that *was* made is that we don't remove the experience from the corpse until the person accepts some kind of resurrection. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Also would it be possiable for someones corpse to "rembmer" that someone cast a revive/res on them if they were off line and pop the little box when they get back on ]</i></font><br><br>This isn't something that would apply to EverQuest very well. The game is situated around helping and being helped by people who are online. Furthermore, it's also about being helped by *other* people. While we can't detect if a person has more than one account and two computers and is using characters from one account to help a character on another, we wouldn't want to create easier ways for this to be done.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011248.html"><b>GM Event Level Limits</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I havne't seen the post that quote came from (though it sounds interesting) but when Abashi was commenting on the ability to prevent those over a certain level from hitting a mob, he mentioned that is was for GM controlled mobs.]</i></font> <br><br>Indeed. The ability to restrict by level is based upon the target being a "acted" NPC, rather an a computer-controlled NPC. I imagine that with enough work we could have implemented this for certain encounters, however we also wanted to restrict the level of assistance that could be offered on Nagafen/Vox raids by people level 53+. Under the original poster's suggestion, clerics for instance would still be able to offer 100% of their normal support to the raid regardless of level.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011243.html"><b>Q&A</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Hey Gordon: I'm going to be in San Diego on business in October. Does Verant give tours of its facilities to the public? If not, is there an opportunity for folks to drop by and say hello? I haven't seen this question addressed here or in the FAQ....]</i></font> <br><br>Due to the amount of development going on and the desire for secrecy, we do not give tours of the facility. We do however have events in various parts of the country to give players the opportunity to meet some of the people behind EverQuest.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011242.html"><b>Burynai Legion Gi - Possible Race Mistake </b></a><br>I'll look into it, however I've noticed that halflings aren't listed either, suggesting that it wasn't intended for small races.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009529.html"><b>Spells Bugged?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The last patch, not today's, introduced a bug that would rob the caster of SLN when he/she cast Shadowbond. This bug doesnt affect Pact of Shadow, only Shadowbond. It also doesnt affect any of the other HP buffs like Reso or Heroism, just SLN.<br><br>Please fix this asap.]</i></font> <br><br>Shadowbond had to be implemented in a manner that caused it to be incompatible with regen spells in order to be sure that it could stack with Pact of Shadow. This was done to keep people from casting those spells on multiple people (for multiple benefit) with a fraction of the disadvantage.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011021.html"><b>Experience and Mana</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I was just wondering, why aren't these two things (mana and experience) delt with in numbers? Now I'm not saying "Bah! You need to tell us why wah wah wah nerf it blah blah" I'm just wondering why this is. In every other roleplay game I have played, this hasn't been much of an issue, it's just been there]</i></font> <br><br>There are certain things that we do not want players to be able to calculate out to a "certainty". Experience and mana are things that we'd prefer remain mysterious in nature. <br><br>I understand that values are given in pen and paper games, but I'd propose that they are only given because it *has* to be given, since there is no backend invisible process to make the calculations. Someone has to know what to do with the dice rolls. <br><br>As for other CRPGs, people do not typically play them with the intention of min-maxing their way up to the most efficient combination of stats, gear, and skills possible, so it's not usually an issue there.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009508.html"><b>Voice Technology</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Dragon doesnt work ]</i></font><br><br>Dragon NaturallySpeaking 4.0 works, as that is what the programmer used when developing the feature. Any SAPI 4.0 compliant recognition engine should work. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Verant Tech Support hasnt even been freaking trained on this - NICE. Abashi, why why why would you guys put such a message into the patch message - use Dragon - IT DOESNT WORK.]</i></font><br> <br>This feature isn't supported by our Tech Support department, as there are far too many voice recognition programs out there for us to be versed in them all. If you are having problems getting it to work, you'll want to contact Dragon, as the problem is with configuration of that product. <br><br>Assuming you have the appropriate version of a compatible product installed and working for other applications, check the EQROKManualSupplement.doc in your EverQuest directory for instructions on using it in EverQuest.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009720.html"><b>Consent</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Basically yo give everyone consent to drag your corpse. Great for large hunts where lots of ppl may be dragging or relaying corpses. Fits in with a realistic view since anyone can pick up a corpse and drag it to safety.<br>Would be of great benefit imo.<br><br>/consent group<br>/consent guild]</i></font> <br><br>Giving *everyone* consent to drag your corpse would have too large of an abuse potential for us to consider entering it. Due to this abuse potential, we prefer that be expressly granted on a per-character basis.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008375.html"><b>Rogues on PvP</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why can't rogues pickpocket on PVP]</i></font> <br><br>During design of the PvP environment, we decided that there was too much abuse and harassment potential with pickpocketing other players, so elected to disallow it. <br><br>For instance, if I'm a rogue that has nothing to fear from you, I can follow you around for an extended period pick-pocketing you without consequence. At least if I'm attacking you, you escape at some point due to death, but there would be no escape from the pick-pocketing.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009100.html"><b>Customize the Spellbook</b></a><br>There are many new enhancements to the user interface planned. What ones will make the "final" product is too hard to say at the moment. Rowyl is doing the interface enhancements and he visits this board regularly and maintains a list of desired changes.</UL>

Gordon was back on the Gameplay Board this afternoon and generated the following posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011227.html"><b>Experience Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi: Do you get less xp for reds then blues? <br><br>Now I am level 30. I was fighting blue Mountain Giants in Frontier Mountains most (blue to me at 30) for a while in a group of four all around 30 and getting great xp! Like noticable movement. Then I joined a group in Overthere fighting RED and YELLOW mobs with a group of four all around 30. We fought those mobs for a much greater time and ended up with much less experience.]</i></font> <br><br>Things can be a little harder to measure in level 30, which requires more experience than normal were the experience curve linear in nature. I would imagine that your experience might also have something to do with what will typically be more downtime between fights when encountering yellow and red NPCs. <br><br>Also, while I can't say if the zones mentioned apply, some zones have greater or lesser experience modifiers than others. For instance, fighting in dungeons gives more experience per kill than fighting in most outdoor areas. The zone that gives the greatest experience modifier is actually on Faydwer, not Kunark. <br><br>It is possible that a red in one zone could give less experience than a blue in another.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011200.html"><b>The /Who Feature</b></a><br>The command does exist but is restricted to use by GMs and Guides. <br><br>Due to the way player lists are compiled by the servers, opening this command for public use would place a load on our system infrastructure (processing time, network traffic, and outside bandwidth) beyond that which is appropriate given the benefit that the command would bestow. <br><br>We have to keep a very close eye on the resources that are consumed by any feature in the game in order to maintain a playable environment for everyone.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011199.html"><b>Guard Attacks</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Why did the harmless act of casting an Evo DD spell on another PC, outside of a duel, cause the guard to aggro?]</i></font> <br><br>The guards only care about the intent, not the affect. The guard only considers the spell, not whether that spell successfully landed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Why did the guard wait until the second cast to respond?]</i></font> <br><br>Guards roll to decide whether or not they are going to assist, based upon the faction of who is being attacked. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Then she suggested I cast on her instead. No damage done, but I can still learn.]</i></font> <br><br>There you have the reason behind the answer for #1. Were there no negative impact to casting upon her, you could essentially macro up your skills in the safety of a city.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011192.html"><b>"I Tank Therefore...wait...I'm a Wizard?"</b></a><br>ROFL :)  Thanks for the story. <br><br>I remember once in beta when I was checking out diamond skin. My wizard blew away one of the ice giants outside Permafrost before he got through the skin. This was of course before interrupts transferred through skins.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011195.html"><b>Cleric Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: OK Im pretty disturbed about this, the last 3 times fear was cleared there were on the average 5 boogeys 4,6,5 respecivly. 2 out of 3 times nothing droped.( a blighted cap droped the 3rd time)<br><br>How is this fair when in hate there are so many clerics/revs/ninja mummys its crazy.<br><br>When you made the change to the fingers you did something to the boogey spawn there used to be 8-10. ]</i></font><br><br>Additional fright fingers came from phoboplasm encounter tables, it didn't affect the number of boogey men. <br><br>Anyway, the number of creatures of each type that can spawn is based upon percentages. Like anything else that involves random numbers, you can get good or bad rolls. Perhaps you end up with more targets and less loot, fewer targets and more loot, or unfortunately, even fewer targets with less loot. Three plane-clears do not represent enough trials to establish a meaningful average. <br><br>Given that different servers have reported loot deficiencies for different classes, everything appears to be working properly.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011185.html"><b>Veeshan's Peak</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think the main problem is.. there should be NO CONTEST as to whether or not you use any Veeshan's Peak loot. There are a great many robes that are *easy* to get and *much* better than that robe. And it's not one robe. I can think of two off the top of my head and I've never been to Veeshan's Peak.(The second one sucks for a different reason, but sucks none the less.)]</i></font> <br><br>That's certainly a valid opinion, but not how we decided to implement it in this case. From a game perspective, making every piece of loot in one zone obsolete everything in every other zone wouldn't make much sense. <br><br>VP has it's extraordinary loot. In fact, most of it is extraordinary. That said, there are still some white elephants running around.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011190.html"><b>Running Across Norrath</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ther is no rational explanation that Abashi or Verant can give for having this long run.]</i></font> <br><br>Everfrost is a remote area, as intended. The long run back home is one of the ways that you pay for your exceptional stats and relatively good faction. <br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If Verant wanted to really show that it valued it's customers time, it would increase the running speed of everything in norrath. This wouldn't affect game play, becuase teh MOBs would run faster too, simply change whatever variable that walking speed is set at, and double that. Suddenly, everybody in this game would be happy.]</i></font> <br><br>Somehow I doubt that anything so easy would "suddenly" make everyone happy :)<br><br>Anyway, the size of the world is one of the aspects of gameplay, and that would certainly be affected by an across-the-board increase in running speed. Not to mention, the value of teleportation is based primarily upon its ability to reduce travel time. <br><br>While I appreciate your suggestion, base running speed is a core foundation of EverQuest and not at all likely to be changed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: eriously though, they'll probably spout some nonsense about it shrinking the world or something]</i></font> <br><br>I guess you win.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011180.html"><b>Tracking</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Tracking is a wasted skill.. With all the spoiler sites everything is pretty much mapped out.. All most people use Tracking for is to see if that named mob that drops the "ph4t l3wtz" has spawned.]</i></font> <br><br>Perhaps for static spawns, however it's very useful for the rarer outdoor encounters. We also have some plans to enhance tracking for rangers in the near future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011158.html"><b>Board System</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am so glad that Brad and Gordon have tried to keep things on close and personal between the user base and themselves. This is VERY rare.<br><br>Verant COULD very well release any and all information through their marketing department and/or PR agency instead of taking time to chat with people on the boards or in game.]</i></font> <br><br>Indeed. It's actually been recommended that we close the boards and go to a "Public answering of email" format used by a lot of companies out there, as then we'd only have to post what we'd like. <br><br>Our current format provides a much closer and personal communications platform, which is what we want to support. Our goal is to have more *communication* with our customers as a whole than any other company out there. <br><br>Thank you all for the positive comments :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011170.html"><b>Deity Spawn Times</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Diety Spawn Times. Can they be randomized?]</i></font> <br><br>Aside from initial spawns that occur once the servers come back up, anything with a spawn time of over two hours receives a random modifier to the spawn time that could cause it to spawn sooner or later than when expected. The modifier is percentage-based, so that the average spawn time (based on large numbers) is roughly the same as when they were spawning after an exact interval.</UL>

A movement is being formed on Rallos Zek by the citizens.  Here's the word from Kyoshou:<BLOCKQUOTE>Announcement of Rallos Zek 'boycott'<br> <br>As has previously been announced, Abashi has said Verant will not<br>consider changes to the Rallos Zek server or offering those who want<br>Coin Only Loot a /Movelog to the Team Servers unless he sees some<br>indications of numbers justifying such actions.<br> <br>Thus, a movement of players dedicated to change have organized and<br>decided to give Abashi those numbers.  This is how:<br><br>1.  A guild has been created on Tallon Zek (Coin Only, PVP Teams Server)<br>called the Refugees of Rallos.  This guild is dedicated to showing by<br>action and participation the need of change to Rallos Zek or the offer<br>of a choice to move to those people on Rallos Zek who want PVP to be<br>about roleplay rather than naked gank.  That guild's webpage is here:<br> <br><a href="http://www.neo-tokyo.dynip.com/~neotokyo/ROR.htm">http://www.neo-tokyo.dynip.com/~neotokyo/ROR.htm</a><br> <br>To show support for offering either a change to Rallos or a /movelog<br>choice, all players from Rallos Zek are encouraged to create a light<br>race based character on Tallon Zek and join this guild. .Dates and<br>places to meet to be invited to the guild will be periodically posted on<br>the guild's message boards.<br> <br>2.  A week long 'boycott' of Rallos Zek will be held between<br>10/16/2000(Monday) - 10/23/2000(Sunday).  Participants in the boycott<br>are encouraged to join the Refugees of Rallos guild on Tallon Zek to<br>indicate numbers to Verant and participate in the 'Assault on Oasis' to<br>be held Saturday, 10/22/2000, 4 PM EST to 10 PM EST, on the Tallon Zek<br>server.<br> <br>3.

Gordon Wrinn made a few more posts this evening on the official boards.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011028.html"><b>Expansion Packs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No seriously it is more about principal. Why should someone new to the game get a better deal by $40 than I get since I have been paying $10 a month for a year and a half, and they haven't given any money at all? I have been here contributing to the world and the play.]</i></font> <br><br>It's just a matter of modern economics. When something new comes out, people pay more to get in on the ground floor. For instance, one of the analogies that we think applies is with DVD players. People who went out and bought a DVD player as soon as they came on the market paid more than those who buy one today. If I buy a DVD player today, not only do I get it cheaper than I would have when they first came out, but I'll probably get a better DVD player. The additional amount paid by the first people to go out and buy it is the cost of being able to enjoy it for the last 2 years or so. <br><br>Yes, you've been paying for the past year and a half, but you've had the opportunity to play the game during that time, and that is what the money for you've paid has gone towards.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011123.html"><b>Paying for a Bind</b></a><br>This is just my personal experience, but I've found many people who would bind people offering money and then refuse the money. They just wanted to be sure that the requester wasn't taking it for granted.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011130.html"><b>Ressurection Limit</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I can understand why the corpse decay timer is per account (give people some incentive to not go off and play other characters, leaving corpses littering Norrath), but why is the 3-hour res limit per account?]</i></font> <br><br>It's because we don't want people leaving corpses around until natural decay, without there being any urgency for its recovery. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Could you consider making it per character, or per server?]</i></font> <br><br>Both of the suggestions posed would reduce that urgency.</UL>

Gordon hit the boards again this evening by making the following posts on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011098.html"><b>What's Gordon's Email Address?</b></a><br><a href="mailto:gwrinn@verant.com">gwrinn@verant.com</a> :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011084.html"><b>Guards Killing Because of Race</b></a><br>Many of the other players here have offered excellent insight into your predicament. NPCs take 4 things into account when deciding whether or not to attack you: Race, Class, Religion, and Deeds (what you've done). <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011048.html"><b>False Spell Protection?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I feel that if I'm protected from a spell it should check before It breaks my hide. I know it is not a hard fix to have the spell engine check if the target is valid first.]</i></font> <br><br>It is indeed pretty difficult and time-consuming, but I'll see if we can get harmful spells that don't land added to the list.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011041.html"><b>Paying for Buffs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Do you, as a rule, expect payment for your buff before you perform it?]</i></font> <br><br>Being on the receiving end of buffs, if the person is one I don't know, and he demands payment up front, I'll pay him what he charges. However if he buffs first, and quotes no payment, I'll usually pay several times the going "rate" for the spell.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011031.html"><b>Make God NPCs Petition'd Spawned</b></a><br>Though I appreciate everyone's desire to kill a deity just for the pure experience of it, the deities are supposed to represent the pinnacle of acheivement in EQ. Though we wouldn't implement the "petitioned spawn" idea for anything, the idea of having deities of various powers spawn to suit whatever group happens to be formed at the time really isn't in line with how things are supposed to be in Norrath.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011014.html"><b>Change Treeweave Icon</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The tree weave is a great idea... force players to choose between style and stats]</i></font> <br><br>Indeed, with only 4 different skin types available (not including robes), we have to do something to make things interesting :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011001.html"><b>EQ Server Emulator</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What is this i hear about an EQ server emulator? what is VIs stance towards that? Lot of rumors on the boards about a fully functional EQ server emulator in circulation. What is verants answer to that?]</i></font> <br><br>Connecting to any emulator voids your license agreement. As far as the existence of it, we've referred it to our legal department. <br><br>That said, "fully functional" is a bit of an exaggeration. It's basically a graphical chat room. No combat system. No spell system. No NPCs, and thus, no content. You log and and can run around one zone (without doors/gates etc). Sure, they can pass packets back and forth.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010614.html"><b>Tired of Wasting Time</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You could call me a casual gamer, so I spent THE WHOLE TIME ON LINE TRAVELING from High Hold to Firona Vie. I DID NOT (I REPEAT NOT) have any FUN! Place NPCs at each of the Wizard and Druid gates, and you pay them a certian amount of plat to teleport you to a certian destination]</i></font> <br><br>We wouldn't really be interested in farming teleports out to NPCs, any more than we want them binding people. Though your play style does not have you getting any "fun" out of traveling, you in this case decided that getting to Firiona Vie was worth the effort. For people who do not see that as worth the effort, there are ways to reduce travel time, such as by getting a port. It is however up to the individual player to cultivate the relationships necessary to enable easy travel.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009603.html"><b>New Faces</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will EQ be adding new faces? As the game has expanded diversity in appearance has begun to thin out. There are numerous great NPC faces that would seem to make great PC faces. Since they are already constructed and in the game, I don't know that it would be a problem for EQ to give players a few new options for their character faces. Maybe 2 or 3 more faces for men and women of each race. ]</i></font><br><br>Brad posted last week that new faces may be something that we'll pursue going forward.</UL>

New Velicous tidbits, including a new user interface and <b>three dozen</b> new screenshots, are covered in <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2623698,00.html">GameSpot's new Velicous preview</a> published today.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Specifically, a Verant spokesperson at ECTS reported that one of the new features in the expansion would be an all-new, fully customizable 3D user interface. Since it was released in early 1999, EverQuest players have had to use a somewhat cumbersome and plain-looking but nonetheless serviceable graphical interface while playing the game. The new interface in Velious will be much more customizable by comparison; for instance, you'll be able to create multiple chat windows, so that you could isolate messages sent by your group or guild from the rest of the messages that normally appear on screen. You'll also have more control over what elements appear on the screen, and where they go. </UL>

Weapons cannot be set to use the Hand-to-Hand skill.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011025.html"><b>Mask of Mardu and Other 'Non'-identifible Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The spell, Muzzle of Mardu, says all races NO classes. Would it be so hard to place "PET" in the list of available classes?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually yes, we can only list actual classes in the class listing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I guess my biggest gripe, is Everquest is the first game where there is absolutly no documentation on what a spell does nor how to use it. Without the hacking of the data files, about half the spells would still be unknown. Was this Verants intent?]</i></font> <br><br>Well it obviously wasn't our intent for people to crack the data file, but it was our intent that there would be virtually no information on what spells do in game. We wanted players to figure them out and pass the data around through anecdotes. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Second, Even after we give the muzzle to our pets, we get no message indicating it even did anything. I gave the pet grubs and I get the exact same response. Could the pet at least acknowledge that the item didn't just get eaten? "Jobeker twists in defiance as you place the Muzzle on." ]</i></font><br><br>Can't do this either. Object-specific emotes are not supported. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lastly, Duration? Is it permanent? Does the pet eat thru it eventually? Does it stack with burnout, or does burnout overwrite the effect?]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, it is permanent, or at least until the pet dies or disappears. And yes, it does stack with burnout, in the same fashion that haste spells such as Alacrity stack with haste items such as the FBSS.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011012.html"><b>Veeshan's Peak Casters Robes</b></a><br>Like in any other zone, some loot in Veeshan's Peak is going to be better than others. I appreciate your suggestion that everything in there should be equal or better than anything else in the game, but if we loaded "super" loot on everything, there wouldn't be anything special to getting a really good item. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011016.html"><b>Bladestorm Skyfire and Damage Rain Issues</b></a><br>The disadvatages to wielding the weapons mentioned are not bugs. The fact that the wielder is damaged by the proc is the only thing that allows us to create weapons of that power. I have heard that some have learned some tricks allowing them to wield these weapons more effectively, you might want to ask around a bit.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010915.html"><b>Fiery Avenger Clones</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone remember the "Feiry Avenger" clone weapons all tanks were promised Abashi?]</i></font> <br><br>First, there will be no Fiery Avenger "Clones". There will be items however that are of similar stature. Second, they won't be just for tanks, but for all classes. Lastly, the quests are in the development and testing stages right now. They'll go in game soon.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010998.html"><b>Iksars and Enchanters</b></a><br>Iksar have devolved too much to be enchanters, clerics, wizards, etc. They only retained the ability to practice necromancy due to its strength in their culture. I'll buy that they have a harder time getting ahold of crafted items, however those items are bonuses rather than "must-have" items. <br><br>The added difficulty of obtaining those items and the relative isolation of the race are some of disadvantages they have to offset their tremendous advantages.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009721-7.html"><b>GM Changing a Name, Too Extreme?</b></a><br>Changing "Anyone" looks a little borderline to me, of course that's me. <br><br>The naming policy is implemented by people, which means that judgement calls are often necessary on the part of the person enforcing the policy. We obviously cannot list every prohibited name imaginable, so that judgement call will always be necessary. We fully understand that names represent the "online identity" of a player, and do not change them arbitrarily. That said, there will always be questionable changes as much as we'd try to avoid them.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010177-2.html"><b>No Charter, No Play</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No Chanter, No Play, is Annoying<br><br>Eventually you somehow get 5 or more mobs. This is simply impossible without a chanter post 50.]</i></font> <br><br>I've given this a little thought, and I think that I'm ok with the idea that if a group of six ends up with 5 NPCs on them, and they don't have an enchanter, then they have to gate or die. <br><br>Enchanters excell at making the impossible possible. If everything that were possible with an enchanter were possible without an enchanter, there wouldn't be much point. Being able to take <5 critters at once without an enchanter is far from being "No chanter, no play". <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010492.html"><b>"Off Hand" Weapons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I understand that Everquest is Vevant's game and they can do and change whatever they want at a drop of a hat. After all, we are in their world now! The idea of having "off hand" only weapons is...

Obviously this only catches those who do it unintentionally, but those who do it intentionally can be addressed via other means. <br><br>This isn't something we plan on changing going forward.

Brad responded to a post written by a player seeking a truely dynamic world.  Here's the thread from the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010769.html">Gameplay Board</a>:<UL>Anyone see one?<br>Lower Guk is still the same (you will see it all again in 30 min or so... <br>*POP*<br>"Hail Ghoul Lord"<br>See?<br>***<br>~ Black Burrow is the "Same as it ever was"..<br>~ "Could you please mark me into your calendar for Plane of Fear/Hate? I need my full set of (insert name here)"<br>Let's see... Gix is still in the same place.. so is Dvinn... oh hey Grimfeather... SG near P1... Is it safe to run through Kithicor? Yeah Orcs are here and the Gnolls are here and Broon is here, and the guards are here... Oh Fippy...<br><br><b><I>A truly and realistically dynamic world is one of the MMORPG 'holy grails.'<br><br>I expect we'll 'get there' some day, but it will be a while. On the road there, however, you'll see incremental advancements. Second generation MMORPGs will be more dynamic than first, etc.<br><br>Personally, I'd like to see a huge, detailed world that changed according to what players and GMs wanted/did. BUT, the changes need to make sense, they need to retain context. <br><br>One short term way to achieve a 'dynamic world' is to randomly generate and scramble content, whether it be quests, world geometry, or whatever. I think we'll see more experiments into this realm in the future because it is a much easier route to a 'dynamic world.' You don't need hordes of game designers and world builders... you don't need incredibly sophisticated world and NPC AI that reacts and changes based on events... rather, you just need lots of variables and a good random number generator.<br><br>This approach, however, at least for a player and designer such as myself, leaves me wanting. One day I'd like to see a huge, detailed world with every alleyway having a story behind it, a world so vast that it might take several years for a player to have explored everywhere (if it were even possible for one player to do so!). A world that changes but makes sense... perhaps a war ravages several villages, or perhaps a volcano erupts creating new mountain or island (and you SAW it erupt!)... perhaps a group of players went on a daring quest and, barely surviving, triumphed -- and the nobles of the land talked about your accomplishment and treated you differently for some time...<br><br>Anyways, we have a long road ahead of us in terms of MMORPG development and I'm glad to be part of a company who is committed to reaching those goals :)<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>

Received word from the fine blokes at GameSpot UK that Velicous has been covered in a couple of their features from ECTS 2000.  ECTS 2000 is like e3 in many respects, only held in Europe.  Here's the links:<UL><LI><a href="">Design Sketches and Preliminary Render</a><LI><a href="http://video.gamespot.co.uk/ects2000/pc/news/0,12006,2623778,00.html">EverQuest: The Scares of Velious First Look</a></uL>Here's a quick excerpt from the article itself:<UL>Velious is home to a number of such anthropomorphic beasts, including otter men, walrus men, and more. But you'll also find stranger inhabitants such as flying monkeys, enchanted suits of armour, and the mysterious snow dervishes. </UL>Thanks Nicola!
