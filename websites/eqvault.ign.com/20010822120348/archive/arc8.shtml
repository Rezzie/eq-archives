I'll see if I can get that fixed. <br><br>While we're at it, if there are any other misspellings like that you've seen, reply to this post and let me know about it and I'll pass them on to the team. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000019.html"><b>Roleplaying or just playing?</b></a><br>nowimnothing22 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well, as a player who actually tries to take the game as more then a endless struggle to level, roleplay is quite possible and can be worked into the character without sacrificing the ability to advance said character. For example, I play a level 30 ranger on the Druzzil Ro server, who worships Tunare...So obviousally, I never got into groups to hunt Treants, but I didn't take it upon myself to hang out near them and harass players that decided to hunt them. I think this is a example of how to intergrate roleplay into a system that dosn't require it. <br><br>It's all about attitude. For instance, my ranger is going to raise a few eyebrows at the dark elf shadowknight that comes up to him and quotes: <br><br>"Sow, plz!" <br><br>This is where my chracter might /glare and tell the dark elf that he has no clue what he wants, and to please take his presense elsewhere...Ironically, one of my characters closest friends and groupmates is a Dark Elf Shadowknight, and my ranger has no problem fighting for this Shadowknight, and doing most anything for him. OOCly, it's becuase the player behind said shadowknight is a friend. In Character, my ranger trusts this character, and beleives him to be exception to the "Evil" shadowknight... <br><br>I think the trick to roleplaying on a non PVP server is to realize that it's not always possible. I myself made a few rules for it that made everything really simple. <br><br>/say and /emote and /shout are in character things. My characters will not /say "I'm a level xxx of this class" or "Give me sow and i'll start pulling yellows and we'll rake in some nice exp" <br><br>/group, /guild, /tell, /ooc, /auction -- there are all out of chracter things, I don't really roleplay in these forms unless someone else is and it's the logical reason to roleplay back, for instance, if a friend sends me a tell that is obviosally in chararacter, i'm going to respond in the same way. <br><br>It's all about balence, and knowing when roleplay is called for, and when you can't do it. Basically, try as hard as you can to make your chraracter have a personality, and roleplay should come quite naturally. ]</i></font><br><br>You've pretty much nailed it. When playing tabletop roleplaying games I'm usually very careful to keep my in character comments in character. But that doesn't mean that I don't throw things at people or comment on someone's particularly bad B.O. out of character. Though when sitting around the table we can more easily rely on visual clues to in and out of character conversations. <br><br>In the end, roleplaying isn't a chore. And a character with a personality is very easy to play. <br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi Alan, <br><br>I've been reading the above-titled discussion with great interest. I've always had an affinity for roleplaying, and despite the fact that I don't roleplay much myself, I'm very receptive to those who do, and quickly jump into it when confronted with somebody who is roleplaying. I've also noticed that it appears to be the roleplayers who are most likely to be "chosen" for active participation in the "big events" that are part of the historical quests. (One example: Banegrivm on Druzzil Ro was "chosen" to lead the Light armies in battle against Lanys T'Vyl and the Tier'Dal in Bloody Kithicor.) <br><br>This ties in very closely with another topic earlier regarding "What is the Story of EverQuest" or something along those lines, where people were proposing such things as the Qeynos Guard burning down Fish's Ale and such. <br><br>I think you missed the point of the person who took issue with your statement, "Pacifists don't make good adventurers." <br><br>What he was trying to say, I think, and I don't know if I can be any more clear about it, is that "adventuring" does not mean killing or helping people kill. There are many, many things that can happen in a roleplaying game that can be considered "adventuring" that don't involve killing at all. Riddles, goal-oriented quests, information gathering, etcetera. <br><br>I definitely agree that a pacifist doesn't make a good adventurer *if* you define "adventuring" as "go kill this beast and bring me its head" and so on. However, I think that is a very narrow definition of "adventuring". <br><br>An example: there is a small quest for Wizards in Qeynos, in which the quester must bring a note to a wizard NPC (I've forgotten his name) who tends to loiter around the guard tower in Qeynos Hills. The reward for this quest is a spell and some experience. Now this might not seem like much of a quest, and it's not, but making that trip from Qeynos to that tower at first or second level does have some element of risk to it, yet does not require the slaying of any NPC. In my book, this is still "adventuring". <br><br>So I think a more appropriate statement would be that "pacifists don't make good killers". And, well, that's a no-brainer. <br><br>Cheers<br>Darkas Dusk<br>Tier'Dal Warrior <br><br>(agnostic, and very difficult to roleplay!) ]</i></font><br><br>That's reasonable enough. Pacifists make poor killers. :)<br><br>And, in essence, you are correct. We have defined 'adventurer' in the more aggressive sense for the most part. But you can most certainly adventure in EverQuest as a pacifist, as long as you are adventuring as such. So you can see the world, a lot of it anyway. You can talk to the people. You can do several quests. All that is adventuring. <br><br>But EverQuest was designed around the concept of an adventurer in the sense of Conan, or even Robin Hood. A design choice that I think was a good one. And, yes, in that world an 'adventurer' that is a pacifist won't be as good of an adventurer as the brutal warrior.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing for XP, Not Loot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br>--------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Regardless, you can travel and see the world without having a quest. I know a lot of folks that simply make up their own reasons to visit >other places (such as their High Elf wanting to see the library at Erudin). Developing your >character is not entirely our responsibility, most of that falls onto the player. <br>--------------------------------<br><br>My first comment may be more suited to the role playing thread, but it's in response to something here, so that's that. Once, when my ranger was but a young, level 6 or 7 lad, he went mad. He babbled about "steam" and how steam would change all of Norrath, and vowed to go visit the gnomes to learn about steam. So, at a young level, I found a good role play reason to journey all the way to Ak'Anon for the first time, RPing the whole merry way. (This was before the steam ship to Velious, too) <br><br>That leads me to a possible questing idea for you to toss to the quest makers. Some have complained that more quests must be made that offer greater experience rewards, or that involve your character more. How about "curse quests," or whatever you'd like to all them? <br><br>Simply put, they would work by putting a burden and/or penalty on a character for the time the quest is active, only being removed until the quest is finished. Because of the downside for players - they could be stuck with the penalty for a while if they don't get right to questing - the exp rewards for these quests could be bumped up while still remaining fair. Of course, some way to ensure players know they are about to undertake a quest of this type must be in place. Easy enough. Make the bracketed text, or the quest text, in red (or some other BOLD color). Here are some simple ideas that can be easily modified to fit a variety of quests: <br><br>Cindy Perlam of Qeynos has a problem. Her infant son is terribly sick and needs medical attention, and only the kind a high elf doctor can give. She wants you to take her son to Felwithe for treatment. The problem is, the lad takes up a full inventory slot and leaves a character with a permanent encumbered and/or snared effect until the trip to Felwithe and back is done. If there is a way to have the infant NO RENT to ports (a little boy can't survive a port, can he?) all the better. <br><br>Sir Lenderslat in Freeport has had some nasty rumors about him passed around, and because you were set up at the local tavern (maybe prompted by another quest), he thinks you did it! You have to clear your name, and his, by shuffling a series of notes and keywords around Freeport. The problem is, you have gone completely KOS to every guard in the city. You must clear your own name by restoring Sir Lenderslat's good name, at which time the 10,000 point faction hit you took will be counteracted by another 10,000 point hit in the opposite direction. <br><br>Lugga the Ogre just doesn't like being fat anymore ... so if she has to be fat, you all have to be! When you agree to help her get the diet food she needs to slim down, she fattens you up first to punish you in case you failed. Your AGI and CHA plummet, and worse yet, you begin eating at three times the normal rate. The effects remain until you can get Lugga the low fat grub she needs, which must be gathered from several locations and cooked up for her by a master baker. <br><br>What about a quest that ruins a character's ability to speak common, leaving only, say, halfing as a means to communicate? Or one that has every banker in Norrath thinking you're a bank robber and refusing to serve you but one, the one in Runnyeye, who is also the only one who can clear your name? Or a troll who thinks you're so ugly, he casts a semi-permanent invis on you until you can finish his quest? <br><br>And so on. Will players take on quests that stick them with penalties if it means better role playing or more exp in the end? I don't know. But if possible to incorporate quests like these, I think they would make questing more interesting, dynamic and fun. Just an idea, <br><br>Talmer [Winter Raven]<br>Ranger, Bristlebane ]</i></font><br><br>I love some of your ideas. I'm not sure how many people would be entertained by the idea of having an Ogre stuff muffins down you until she's comfortable in your presence&#8230; but I would! <br><br>Thanks for the amusing ideas. I'll make sure the team sees them.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>Economy Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan, you wrote "So a few months after allowing people to destroy their FBSS to create, I dunno, Felt Fedora's of Coolness, then the FFoC would replace the FBSS on the list of items that are too common for the sake of the economy." <br><br>What if the FFC were NO DROP? That would effectively remove the FBSS from the economy without introducing a new problem. This is effectively what you are doing with some of the Epic Quest items. <br><br>Sheesh]</i></font> <br><br>But it would be created by a trade skill, so making it No-Drop wouldn't be too cool. Then to get the FFC you'd have to be a master tailor yourself, and you'd only ever make one, since you couldn't sell it.</UL>

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Rangers</a>.  They are in tune with nature and as such share the spirit of the druids. With many druidic spells at their disposal they are also fierce warriors, and exceptional with the bow. Rangers are excellent group members and are often used to track, pull or heal in the down time, however; they can also solo as they have the ability to buff and heal themselves.... but how much more is there to know? <br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the defenders of nature.  Casting sow isn't the only thing that they do well.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Rangers of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

Fear not though my friends, for the <br>spiritual rewards of this journey far outweigh any hardship involved.<br><br>As of now, we are once again gathering an adventuring party to protect <br>and serve the lands of Norrath.

Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could <br>bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens.  Maybe your renowned <br>acting skills might be of help.  If you are kind, compassionate, and <br>helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.<br><br>If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be <br>difficult at times.

For the most <br>part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to <br>stack that were never intended to stack.<br><br>- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.<br><br>- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of <br>Cazic Thule can scribe it.<br><br>- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been <br>changed to be more appropriate.<br><br><br><br>** Features and Interface Changes **<br><br>- The variable %t will now work with /assist.  So you can use /assist %t <br>if you wish.  Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist <br>without the %t.<br><br>- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.<br><br>- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to <br>user color 15 (same as other skill messages).  The success message <br>was already set to user color 15.<br><br>- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does.  <br>It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server.  The new <br>ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list <br>(<character name>_<#>.ini).  The first time a character is created or <br>loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old <br>ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.<br><br>- The Alt key now works in several new situations.  It will now show <br>item names when in the trade window.  Because the trade items of the <br>local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item <br>names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player <br>positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade <br>window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade <br>item names.<br><br>- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.<br><br>- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse <br>items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.<br><br>- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when <br>held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they <br>don't show up otherwise).<br><br>- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any <br>player that is on your /ignore list.  Some players were using this <br>to annoy players that had ignored them.<br><br>- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are <br>on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to <br>annoy people that had ignored them).<br><br>- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the <br>members of your guild in your zone.  You can also specify a guild name, <br>such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".<br><br>- /safelock command added.  /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface <br>(mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash <br>commands) with the password that you supply to the command.  You must use <br>this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the <br>interface.  Passwords are NOT case-sensitive.  So to lock your interface, <br>you would type /safelock password.  You would do the same to unlock it.  <br>REMEMBER:  If you forget what password you typed, you will need to <br>reboot your machine.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now <br>also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<br><br>- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.<br><br>- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of <br>your waist.<br><br>- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop.  <br>They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. <br><br>- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable.  <br>There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so <br>we had to disable that for these items.<br><br>- Sewing Kits:  No existing sewing kits are being changed with this <br>patch.  But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different.  <br>Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots.  Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 <br>slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.<br><br>- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty <br>blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.<br><br><br>**  Other Stuff **<br><br>- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level <br>bard title.  :)<br><br>- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with <br>that of his counterparts in Velious.  This is not the sort of thing <br>that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that <br>nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest.  We're <br>announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Just when you thought the madness was over, the EverQuest feud started between Major League Baseball players is back in the news.  Here's an excerpt from the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/columns/stark_jayson/1204732.html">most recent article on ESPN.com</a>:<UL>"Suffice to say that I did not kill one of his characters," Schilling told Wild Pitches. "Only his yellow streak and his ineptness at running around in the woods got him killed. He'd have been fine if he hadn't gone into a 'newbie' panic on me."<br><br>Schilling went on to accuse Glanville of "slanderous lies being spewn, about the kind-hearted (computer) dwarf of mine. Stout and strong, yet gentle is he. But he will not allow his good name to be dragged through the mud by a reckless goof of a Paladin."<br><br><br>Gosh, we love that kind of talk. Next thing we knew, the two of them were on the Dan Patrick radio show Friday, hashing this out. And they plan a rematch online this week. We'll keep you posted. Just bear in mind that these two teams don't meet again until August 10. So there's no telling what kind of computer atrocities could take place between now and then.</UL>Thanks Spuff!

Dynamite Shortfuze has some news for those of you interested in a faire on Fennin Ro:<BLOCKQUOTE>ail my fellow Wizards!<br><br>    As you all know, in months past I have hosted a rune trade/faire for<br>wizards of all levels to come together and help each other out. It has<br>been a great success... with the exception of last month, when it had to<br>be cancelled due to lack of interest (the weekend it was scheduled for,<br>there were a large number of raids happening, and it seems people are<br>more interested in ph4t l3wtz than helping their community). Since then,<br>I have thought long and hard about the faire... and whether it should<br>continue. I decided I would give it one more try, and depending on the<br>reaction of the community, I would either end it or continue it. I<br>planned to do so this month, but am, unfortunately, unable to. However,<br>that does not mean that there should be no Faire. If someone else would<br>like to take it upon themself to host the faire, then by all means, do<br>it! This is an effort of the community, not of any one person, and it is<br>the community's task to help each other out and stick together.<br>Hopefully, by next month things will have settled and I can put the<br>faire together again, properly. Thank you, my friends, for<br>understanding, and I hope I haven't let anyone down who was looking<br>forward to this month. I'm looking forward to seeing you all in June!<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Good luck getting one planned!

A very controversial <a href="http://www.onethumb.com/article.pl?sid=01/05/25/2120210">editorial at Onethumb.com</a> explores the nature of EverQuest's "addiction" and ranks it along with that of tabacco and other similar products.  As always, an excerpt follows:<UL>Lets use the Ragefire example. The cleric epic quest allows a cleric to complete a long series of tasks that result in a weapon. This statistics on this weapon are nice, but the only real reasons to finish it are twofold: prestige, and the clickable effect. It allows clerics to resurrect people without using mana. Nothing more than a timesaver, but none the less convenient. Now this quest is fairly accessible to a large number of clerics over level 50. It isn't too tough, though several parts require forces of over 30 people to come and help you.</UL>Thanks Ben.

It's a very interesting read on a subject that affects everyone who plays the game.  Here's a clip:<UL>To understand the problem of deflation and inflation in VE&#8217;s EQ is a good place to start. Inflation, as Milton Friedman pointed out in a Nobel Prize winning body of work, is when too many dollars chase too few goods. Deflation is the opposite; too few dollars in pursuit of too many goods. In the 1970&#8217;s in America for example, as the money supply (the amount of money in circulation) grew more quickly then the amount of goods and services available in the economy we had runaway inflation; a can of tuna fish might have the price tag raised on it three times before it left the shelf.</UL>Thanks Mandos!

Those looking for an alternative way to pay for your EQ account, Sony Online Entertainment announced something you'll want to check out:<UL>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br><br>SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT LIFTS INTERNATIONAL BARRIERS TO PLAY TOP ONLINE GAMES <br>-- Online Gaming Set to Explode Worldwide With All-New Payment Options Available <br>--<br><br>SAN DIEGO, CA - May 24, 2001 - In an effort to expand online gaming globally, <br>Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) announced today that two alternative payment <br>methods will be available for SOE's massively multiplayer games.  Game Cards <br>will be sold in retail stores this fall throughout Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia <br>as well as North America.  Additionally, JCB (Japanese Credit Bureau) credit <br>cards are now accepted, making EverQuest(r) and SOE's other massively multiplayer <br>games more accessible to an international audience. <br><br>Currently, SOE requires an American credit card number to subscribe to the online <br>game and ultimately this has limited EverQuest's growth abroad.  Game Cards will <br>allow cash holders to experience the best-selling online game of all time in <br>90-day increments and will be available on retail shelves worldwide. <br><br>The JCB Card offers a great opportunity for SOE to reach gamers in Japan and <br>many other Asian countries.  With over 40 million cardmembers worldwide, JCB's <br>sophisticated global payment system network has made it the number one card in <br>Japan and number four internationally among all of the major credit cards. <br><br>"There has been a universal increase in demand for access to our best-selling <br>game, and now we have found a way to reach this broader market by changing our <br>billing methodology," said Scott McDaniel, Vice President of Marketing, Sony <br>Online Entertainment. "We're looking forward to inviting a whole new group of <br>players into the world of EverQuest."<br><br>The EverQuest online game currently boasts more than 385,000 active subscribers, <br>and recently released a popular expansion pack to the game, EverQuest(r): The <br>Scars of Velious(tm), last Fall.  During peak periods, more than 90,000 adventurers <br>and dragon slayers have explored the EverQuest world simultaneously.  The active <br>global EverQuest(r) subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries <br>throughout the "real" world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, <br>Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, Germany and New Zealand. </UL>

Your comments of Gnoll teeth or Lizzard Tails in Ferrott, yes it is a nice little add on for stuff that you are going to kill anyway, but that is not the type of quest that we are talking about. (Bye the way, The DF Belts....that is a quest that should be eliminated as it creates more fights over KS'ing and who had the camp first than anything else.) <br><br>You also have quests like running from Oggok to Neriak to make a delivery, or the bard note quest....sure another great add on if I am going that way any how. Again, not what we are talking about. <br><br>A number of people have said it. We, the lower levels, are dying to see high level type stuff. The only way to get there is to fill up that gold bar. And again, the quests just do not fill the bill. (Did i mention that I am impatient?) The quests that many have been trying to explain to you is stuff will develop the character, see the world sorta stuff. The "Lore, No Drop" stuff is right on, as is requiring different skills to accomplish the task. Something like combineing in a Lore, No Drop box, stuff from the far corners. Faiery boots from Gfay, Sandshark meat from Erudin, a Lizzrd doll from Ferrott, A rare leaf from the Overthere, A mammoth whisker from Everfrost. All No Drop, Lore. Give us lower levels, lower level epic quests, not necessarily for items, but for exp. Just make it worth our while to be "(For)Ever Questing". <br><br>Munpoppy <br>22 Ogre ShadowKnight <br>Bertox Server ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I've received about an equal number of responses from people saying that they hate quests that make them travel as those that say that travel is one of their favorite parts of quests. <br><br>Regardless, you can travel and see the world without having a quest. I know a lot of folks that simply make up their own reasons to visit other places (such as their High Elf wanting to see the library at Erudin). Developing your character is not entirely our responsibility, most of that falls onto the player. <br><br>But I do agree that there will always be more things that we can do to help out in that department. <br><br>-Fix- wrote: <br><br>Greetings ! <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just an idea here, but maybe some NPC's (like hometown NPC's) could only give quests to those who have a very good (or very bad) faction with particular mobs. <br><br>For example, let's imagine a sailor in a freeport bar, talking about his trips around Norrath. During his adventures, a dragon attacked his ship, and slew all his comrades. <br><br>Maybe this sailor could only give his revenge quest to those who have a BAD faction with dragons, and not just a good faction with him. <br><br>This way a sergeant in Kelethin could give a quest to a foreigner who slew many orcs in Everfrost, because he would then have a reputation of orc slayer. <br><br>Just an idea here, but having to destroy factions to make some quests could force people to make choices instead of trying to always have a good faction with everyone. ]</i></font><br><br>Very interesting idea. I'm not sure how practical it is, but it's certainly interesting. Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>More Server Populations and Economies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have been watching this thread for some time and I like many of the suggestions that were made. It has gotten me to thinking of some possibilities that may be feasible. The idea of item decay and maintenance is a good one, if only implemented correctly. Now I realize that these are just suggestions and may not make it into the current game but, maybe they will see light in some future incarnation of a MMORPG. <br><br>The idea is that items have a certain quality or power value. As a characters xp and level increase then the character's equipped items values decrease in an equal amount. This can be justified as use of the items. The items don't decrease just because you have them but rather as the result of quantifiable use. The value can be viewed by right clicking the object and looking at it's bar. As the bar decreases so does it's usefulness. Damage ratios go down, beneficial effects go down, AC goes down, etc. <br><br>Now in order to return the item back to it's original usefulness you must find a PC tradesman of appropriate skill for the item. The person with the item and the tradesman must be grouped and at the towns forge, spinning wheel, etc. and both must enter items for the repair of the item in a trade like window. For example: <br><br>Lany the bard's lambent breastplate is down to half power it's AC 10 of 20. He takes it to Sampson the blacksmith. Sampson and Lany group at the forge and Sampson adds a specially crafted hammer (this hammer would have taken a great deal of plat, ore, molds and such to make), metal bits and water. Lany adds a lambent stone, a gem and 100pp. They click the forge button and Lany gets back the breastplate plus the power goes up based on the value of the items in the forge. Sampson gets back his hammer and the rest is consumed. They both also get some xp. <br><br>You could adjust what is needed based on the item and how much power needs to go up. Some things will be always required such as the hammer, lambent stone and gem. The plat could be adjusted for how much increase is desired. Like a heal, 100pp - minor healing +20 power, 200pp - greater healing +50 power. This way players can decide when they want to repair their items and at what cost. If an item is left to go to zero power there could be a chance it breaks. <br><br>Better items would have higher power and therefore longer lifespans and inferior items shorter lifespans but cheaper to repair. The reason that I suggested xp gain for repair is so the tradesman could reasonable pursue that as a profession. This also has the advantage of limiting abuse as it consequently lowers the power rating of equipped items thus necessitating additional repairs. <br><br>Here is a quick rundown of the advantages and disadvantages: <br><br>ADVANTAGES<br>1. Creates a viable alternative to hack and slash<br>2. Helps make trade skills more useful<br>3. Creates a money sink<br>4. Creates an item sink <br><br>DISADVANTAGES<br>1. Coding all items with power ratings<br>2. Creating new interface for repair (trade window mechanics are already in game however)<br>3. Tracking power ratings when items are traded (items with charges are already in game)<br>4. It's something new, players may not like it (item decay and repair is in many popular games) <br><br>These are just my suggestions hopefully your programmers and glean something viable out of them. <br><br>Faejon Dorunrun<br>Captain / Webmaster<br>Battle Cry of Terris-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>That's a nice way to do it. But it is still item decay, and there is one key item you left off of your evaluation, a disadvantage. Tedium. Nobody is really going to want to go to battle with each of their armor pieces down a few AC points. People will want to maintain them at full value, and doing so will be tedious. That is the nature of item decay, and that's why I'm not a big fan of it.</UL>

The initial phase of localization <br>involves both human and automated translating agents, beginning with French, <br>German, Japanese and Korean.  The localization will allow players to fully interact <br>textually within the game in their own language. SOE is committed to making its <br>incredible array of online games just as accessible to gamers around the world <br>as they currently are to English speaking players.<br>	<br>"The vision of a global gaming community has always been the core of our business <br>model," said Kelly Flock, President, Sony Online Entertainment. "The localization <br>allows us to surpass language barriers and give gamers worldwide the best online <br>gaming experience."<br> <br>Leading off the localized products is EverQuest(r): The Shadows of Luclin(tm), <br>the third expansion pack to EverQuest, the most successful online role-playing <br>game of all time boasting more than 375,000 active subscribers comprise of players <br>from all over the world. Other games planned for localization include: PlanetSide(tm), <br>the world's first massively multiplayer first-person action game set in a persistent <br>world and Star Wars(r) Galaxies(tm), an online game set within the Star Wars <br>universe.<br><br>SOE has already begun the multi-language duplication process for several games. <br>The identical version preserves the look and feel of the game while making it <br>accessible to a foreign language audience.  SOE's plans include the use of real-time <br>machine translation of in-game player chat.  This will allow players to chat <br>even if they do not share a common language.  The combination of localization <br>and advanced translation software will facilitate SOE's position as a worldwide <br>leader in massively multiplayer online games.</UL>

From Aracnakat:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Wizards</a>.  They are the master seekers of knowledge, and their talents and spells are focused on this goal. They use powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals... but how much more is there to know? <br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about these casters of mass destruction.  Teleporting people around isn't the only thing that they do well.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Wizards of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.
