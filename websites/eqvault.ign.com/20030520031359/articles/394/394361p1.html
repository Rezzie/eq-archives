<span class=dateline>April     21, 2003</span> - The caverns of Kaladim were damp and cool, with drips of water creeping through some small crevasses of the rock. The dwarves on guard patrolled the streets as other civilian dwarves went about their business. From inside one house, a smell of a sweet pie flowed outward. GreybloomFarms was quiet that evening, as it always was when the moon reigned supreme out in the mountains, whereas it was usually bustling with farmers tending to the mushrooms or traders scurrying about during the daytime. A fire could be heard crackling warmly in a fireplace as an old dwarf sat in an armchair with smaller, younger ones scurrying about.<BR>
<BR>
"A story, eh, youngins? Oh, ay, I got plenty o' stories to flush out of me mind. Aye, where do I begin?" The old dwarf appeared deep in thought as he looked at a portrait above the mantle where a proud looking dwarf with a stern expression was pictured.<BR>
<BR>
"Ay, the picture above, take a look, youngins. Dat there is me great grandfather, Adolen Boggins I. Eh, I ain't got no idea why they call him the I, cause there ain't no II, something to do with a title o' respect or some junk." The old dwarf reached to a side table and sipped an ale. "O, me great grandfather were full o' adventure, not like your old grandfather here! HAR! Ay, I spent all me days tending to the mushrooms over yonder. I love me life, make no mistake, but ol' Adolen lead a life that I never would see."<BR>
<BR>
The young dwarves smiled, full of interest. An older female dwarf began walking down the stairs. She stopped midway and looked at the dwarf in the armchair. "Aaqcutt Boggins, are you up telling stories again?" One of the young dwarves, Burbkin, turned to the dwarf on the stairs and said, "Grandpa were just fixin' to tell us the tale o' his great granddad, Grandma!" At this, the grandmother dwarf descended the rest of the way, a huge smile on her face. "Ol' Adolen, eh? He were quite a character, that dwarf. I was pretty young, maybe like you young ones, when he passed away. But I remember him, sure 'nuff." She sat in a chair next to Aaqcutt. <BR>
<BR>
Aaqcutt smiled. "Well, where should I begin?"<BR>
<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
It was a cold night in the caverns of Kaladim. True, Kaladim was never really warm, but this night was unusually cold. It was rainy and stormy outside in the mountains, but in the Greybloom Estate, a feeling of warmth ran deep. Seven brothers were sitting on the rug, in front of an armchair, where the female dwarf Alia Boggins sat. Alia's husband, Fleddar, was standing next to the chair. Alia held a bundle in her arms, her face beaming with pride.<BR>
<BR>
"Well," said Fleddar, "what should we name 'im?"<BR>
<BR>
Alia smiled. "Brell hath blessed us, Fleddar. 'Tis the most beautiful child in the whole wide Kaladim. Let us name him after me great uncle Adolen Blither. Adolen, that sound like music to me ears." Fleddar nodded in approval.<BR>
<BR>
The seven brothers were all excited about this potential new development. They were named Fognus, Bognus, Bagnus, Slagnus, Gagness, Magnus, and Wagnus. Although their careers had not yet been determined, they were anxious to set out into the world on their own. But tonight was Adolen's night. The newest addition to the Boggins family was here. Alia placed a locket around Adolen's neck and smiled warmly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That night, Alia and Fleddar slept in their master bed upstairs. The seven brothers slept downstairs on tinier beds, and Adolen slept in a crib next to his mother and father's bed. The silence was eerie, as there was usually a great deal of commotion due to drunken dwarves stumbling in the streets or passing travelers looking for a night's rest. But tonight, no noise was present. No noise, that is, save the eerie clanging of boot on rock. The figure crept through the sleeping city, looking for the one that would be his victim. He moved through a cavern entrance and smiled menacingly looking on the old estate situated next to the mushroom farm. He moved up to the door and with a swift flick of the wrist, it opened. He moved into the house and moved silently up the stairs. Looking at the crib, he pulled back the hood of his cloak and looked menacingly at the child, and began mumbling words as the glowing energy enveloped the bundle and lifted it above the crib. Fleddar and Alia immediately woke, and Alia screamed in terror. Fleddar jumped from his bed and ran to grab the baby, but in a flash of light, the figure, and Adolen, were gone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
The dwarf was on his hands and knees, endlessly scrubbing away the filth and pestilence that were the caverns he called home. A creature came up and kicked him as he fell over in pain, moaning. "Scrub harder, fool!" The dwarf began to stain the floor of the cavern with his tears. The creature once again kicked him. "Tears are for the weak! Scrubbing is for the SLAVES!" Another similar creature came bustling down the hallway. "Stand back, fool!" he said to the creature kicking the poor dwarf. He dismissed him and looked down at the slave. "Your father wants to see you, slave." The dwarf stood and brushed off the dust. He began walking down the halls. A thousand things were running through his mind. How did it come to this? Why did he have to suffer so? Who was this man he called "father?" His "father" was no dwarf. What was he then?<BR>
<BR>
The dwarf entered a large room and kneeled before a figure sitting on a throne of bones. "Father," he said, "ye sent for me." The figure stood. "Rise, my son." The dwarf stood as the figure pulled back his hood and his face was exposed. He stood as well.<BR>
<BR>
"You have disappointed me lately, Adolen."<BR>
<BR>
"How so, meh father?"<BR>
<BR>
"The minotaur tell me you are becoming more and more disagreeable with your chores. It is your duty to do as they tell you. They are your masters. You are lucky you are still alive."<BR>
<BR>
"But, me father, I 'ave always served ye unquestioningly. I did what ye always asked of me. The minotaur hate me because they are no more than beasts!" Meldrath the Malignant struck his son violently across the face as Adolen fell to the floor. "They spare you because I call you son! If I say the word, you would, yourself, be dead," Meldrath said. <BR>
<BR>
"One day, father, these bonds will be broken. I will be free from your terror and your desires to rule the world, and your minotaur will be buried within the rock of these mountains. You and yer minions will be nuttin' more than a TALE, father. A pox on thee! I hate nothing more 'an you." <BR>
<BR>
Meldrath had never had his son speak to him this way before. Fearing Adolen had come out of line, he had two of his minotaur take Adolen to his chamber and beat him. As Adolen lay near death, he looked up at his masters. "You...will...all...die...for...this." The minotaur laughed. "Not before you, child," one of them said. With that they walked off.<BR>
<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
That night, Adolen lay in his chambers. His plot was flawless. Another slave, some dwarf who called himself the King's brother, took the trash away every evening in his wagon, out to the mountains, where he dumped it. Adolen had spoken with him and this night, he would hide in the trash wagon and he and the other slave would make an escape. "Are ye sure o' this?" the slave questioned. "As sure o' anything, friend," Adolen replied. He climbed into the wagon as he became covered in the daily trash. The slave began to wheel it out, and the minotaur paid no attention. He was going to make it! The slave took the wagon finally out of the cavern. Adolen realized this by the change in temperature and sound. No longer such a confined sound, but a sound that flowed off into the mountains. He had left the caverns for the first time in his life! The dwarf slave dumped the trash into the gully, and out went Adolen with it. They ran. They ran as fast as they could. A short distance across the valley, the slave became tired. "There is no time to stop!" Adolen said. But the slave could not speak; he was exhausted.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, Adolen noticed the figure of a minotaur behind the slave. No...three! They were chasing them! "QUICKLY! MINOTAUR!" he shouted to the slave. The slave turned around and began to run, but he was too slow. The minotaur trampled him, as one remained to finish the job. The other two continued to chase Adolen, as he turned and ran. He heard the screams of the slave as his life was cut short, and tears flowed from Adolen's eyes as he tried to drown the sound out. He felt the minotaur not far behind. Finally, he saw a windmill overhead, and the slavers that had chased him stopped and turned back. They would go no further.<BR>
<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
Adolen reached a windmill, panting frantically. He collapsed on the ground. The owner of the windmill saw him and rushed to his aid. He dragged him into the windmill and said a prayer in the name of Brell for the dwarf.<BR>
<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
Adolen sat up as the first rays of sunlight were shining under the door. He yawned, and realized he was still alive, and must be in the windmill. Looking around, he saw a plate of bread and cheese, and downed it quickly. As he finished, the owner of the windmill entered and asked him what had happened and where he was going. Adolen told the owner the entire story as he listened intently, and the owner sensed the quiver of mental anguish in Adolen's voice.<BR>
<BR>
"Ye are a dwarf, lad. Meldrath is no father of yours."<BR>
<BR>
"What can I do? I have finally escaped the bonds of meh evil master, but where do I go now?"<BR>
<BR>
"Mayhap there are still relatives of yours in Kaladim?"<BR>
<BR>
"Kaladim?"<BR>
<BR>
"The dwarf city, lad, in the Butcherblock Mountains." The old gnome explained where Adolen was, how to reach the dwarf city, and much more that Adolen had missed out during his many years under Meldrath's iron grip.<BR>
<BR>
"Then I must be goin."<BR>
<BR>
"Alone?"<BR>
<BR>
"There is nay other way."<BR>
<BR>
"Then...good luck lad. Oh, but take this." The old gnome reached into a pie safe and handed him a few biscuits, some milk, and a club. "That will feed ye and may help ye fight off minor dangers."<BR>
<BR>
Adolen thanked the gnome and left the windmill. He spent several days traveling across the continent of Faydwer, meeting members of several different races and listening to their tales. Although he'd spent 46 years of his life under the service of the evil Meldrath, he was anxious to learn. Finally, though, he reached the Butcherblock mountains, and traveled through the several passes, greeting other dwarves and telling his tale. Finally, on the ninth day, he saw the gate of Kaladim in the distance. That must be it, he thought. He began walking in the direction when he heard a low growling and a creature spoke: "Ugly creature near my feet, methinks that you'll be good to eat!" He turned around and saw the visage of a goblin, a creature he had heard tales of. He readied his club, as he knew he would have to fight it. He had been confined all his life, and had no combat experience whatsoever, so he knew he was in for the battle of his young life. The fight was grueling, but in the end, the goblin triumphed, knocking Adolen to the ground. Adolen looked up, as the goblin raised his arms, preparing to bring them down and end his life. <BR>
<BR>
"Die, ye green skinned beast!" Another dwarf ran by, smacking the goblin in the head with his club. The green thing fell dead near Adolen, as a blue light washed over him, and he suddenly felt the pangs of sharp pain fade. He stood and thanked the dwarf. The dwarf bowed.<BR>
<BR>
"Me name is Fognus. Fognus Boggins."<BR>
<BR>
"Well, I thank ye, Fognus. I was just on my way to Kaladim, it been a long journey."<BR>
<BR>
"Returnin' home, eh?"<BR>
<BR>
"Nay, Fognus...I know nuttin' of dis place. Only that I may have spent a short time 'ere as an infant."<BR>
<BR>
"What be yer name?"<BR>
<BR>
"Adolen."<BR>
<BR>
Fognus froze. He looked the dwarf up and down, and saw the locket around his neck that Fognus' mother had given to Adolen. He grasped Adolen and hugged him tightly. "Brudder!" Adolen was naturally confused.<BR>
<BR>
Fognus smiled. "Come...I will tell ye all I know." Adolen nodded, but he still had know idea what was going on.<BR>
<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
"Ohh, youngins, dis story gonna have to wait. Yer grandpa getting tired," Aaqcutt said. The children were disappointed. "But we wanna know, grandpa! Does Adolen ever accept Fognus as his brudder? What happens after dat?"<BR>
<BR>
Aaqcutt smiled. "Tomorrow, youngins, tomorrow. Will give ye sumtin to look forward to." The grandmother, Flora, stood up and helped Aaqcutt out of his chair.<BR>
<BR>
"Now ye all get to bed!" Flora said. The children obeyed and crawled into their smaller beds as Aaqcutt and Flora smiled at each other and headed upstairs for some rest.<BR>
<BR>
