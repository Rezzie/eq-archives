Here is the official SoV Launch Party press release as sent to me by Erica Kohnke:<UL>MEDIA ADVISORY<br><br>Sony Online Entertainment Celebrates Imminent Launch of "EverQuest(r): The Scars <br>of Velious(tm)" in Las Vegas Desert at Largest Online RPG Fan Event in History <br><br>Over One Thousand EverQuest Fans First to Explore New Frozen Continent, Meet <br>Team Members and Congregate Off-line<br><br>San Diego, CA - November 6, 2000 - Sony Online Entertainment Inc. is pleased <br>to announce that the official launch party for fans of "EverQuest(r): The Scars <br>of Velious(tm)" was an unmitigated success.  "Velious" is the second expansion <br>pack for the most successful online role-playing game in history, and attracted <br>over one thousand EverQuest fans in Las Vegas on November 4-5.  "Velious," the <br>add-on to the best selling "EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark" product, ships this <br>December.<br><br>"It was definitely a party to remember," said Jeff Butler, producer of "Scars <br>of Velious."  "We were overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of our fans - they make <br>the games great and make our effort worthwhile.  I was flabbergasted that fans <br>came from all across the country, from Virginia to California, to attend our <br>party!"<br><br>The attendees to the party were the first to explore the new continent and mingle <br>with the creators of EverQuest(r) at The Bellagio Hotel and Planet Hollywood <br>in Las Vegas.  Memorable events included:<br><br>* Over fifty EverQuest guilds assembled at The Bellagio Hotel and met their members <br>in person, some for the first time.  The largest guild consisted of twenty fans.<br>* Thirty fans arrived in full costume to portray their favorite characters from <br>EverQuest, including wood elves, barbarians, Iksars, and warriors.<br>* The fans benefited from numerous giveaways and drawings during the festivities. <br> Prizes included the Scars of Velious expansion pack, hand-painted pewter figurines, <br>lithographs of Velious artwork, NVIDIA video cards, and one-year membership of <br>EverQuest sponsored by Ignited Minds.<br><br>About "EverQuest: The Scars of Velious"<br>Starting this December, "EverQuest: The Scars of Velious" will take hundreds <br>of thousands of EQ players to an all-new frozen continent.  In addition to perils <br>inherent in the environment, players will meet with new NPCs, cast new spells, <br>handle new weapons, and don upgradeable armor.<br><br>"EverQuest: The Scars of Velious," is the second expansion pack for the most <br>successful online role playing game in history, and takes the more than 300,000 <br>current EverQuest players on dozens of new quests and adventures. The pack features <br>16 new advanced adventure zones, numerous new creatures and spells and weapons <br>in an enhanced 3D game engine. <br><br>"Velious" is located south of Antonica, and features ice caves, crystal caverns, <br>dungeons and frozen towers. The new cast of visually stunning non-player characters <br>includes frost giants, ice dragons, bloodthirsty orcs, cave bears, Snowfang gnolls, <br>storm giants and vicious ottermen. The continent features three times the amount <br>of polygons and twice the detail of the current EverQuest world.<br><br>Unlike its predecessor, "The Ruins of Kunark," this expansion pack requires players <br>to own a copy of "EverQuest" and is designed for higher level characters.<br><br>About Verant <br>Verant Interactive Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Online Entertainment <br>Inc.

Bishoopugget sent me the following letter:<BLOCKQUOTE>Queen Velazul Di'zok slain on Luclin!  (11/5/2000)<br><br>In what will be remembered as the epitome of teamwork and skill, a multi-guild raid fought it's way through the entire line of royalty within Chardok.  With the expert pulling of Wang and Khato of Apex, we made it to the Overking and bested him just 90 minutes after entering Chardok.  After such a flawless raid we decided that a full coffin corpse retrieval would be acceptable in the pursuit of knowledge and experience against the previously untouched Queen of Chardok.  Needless to say, 20 seconds after our battle with the Queen started it ended with her own death cry and the cheers of many of the finest guilds of Luclin.<br><br>A hearty congratulations to all the guilds and players at this unforgettable event.<br><br>Bishoopugget<br>Pappanug of the Nuggets of Justice</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

The following is the Saturday Edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/026835.html"><b>Necro Pet Issue</b></a><br>The weapon integrated into the model for that character and their subsequent attacks were accounted for when the pet was designed. Pets, as they exist, are as strong as they can be given the overall balance of the world. While I agree that it would make sense for the 59th pet to do better than the 49th pet (which I believe it does under most circumstances, even if it is close), this is a case where the 49th is stronger than it should be as opposed to the 59th being weaker.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028054.html"><b>Velious Ad Mistake</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Saw this mentioned in a thread about a week ago. Someone saw an ad in which Verant uses their catch phrase "Your in our world now," and pointed out the grammatical error and the difference between 'your,' and 'you're.' <br><br>Just got the latest CGW and was flipping through when I saw the 2 page ad for SoV and sure enough, the phrase is displayed in large letters on the left hand side with the grammatical error. <br><br>Is the error there because the phrase is grammatically incorrect in the manual and they just took it as it appears there without noticing the mistake? <br><br>Or... <br><br>Did someone at VI actually catch the error, but was told to leave it as is, since fixing the phrase at this point in time would be an admission of a mistake, so it's better to just pretend all is well and 'working as intended?' :)]</i></font><br><br>It was a mistake, pure and simple. To my knowledge the mistake only appeared in an ad or two, not in any manual.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028223.html"><b>Feign Death</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you feign while a mob is casting a spell on you you feign death has a ZERO percent chance of working on that mob.. but still can fool any others around you till they RE-AGRO YOU becuase the caster didnt forget you.. NPCs need to STOP casting when a pc FEIGNS.. Its a BUG that they dont and completely makes the skill useless in any bad situation with casters.]</i></font> <br><br>While I know some will disagree, this is how it is intended to work. Once an NPC begins casting a spell, only a stun will stop them. Even if you die mid-cast, the spell will still go off on a corpse. <br><br>It's one of the vulnarabilities of Feign.</UL>

Menuven sends the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>     An army of men and women converged in three areas of the land of <br>Norrath this eve.  Specters of great power loomed, the gods of our world <br>taking semi-mortal form to test our mettle.  Three times they were defeated.  <br>Three times they rose again.  Until the final battle, in the forest of <br>Nektulos, where the Ghost of the dead God Atrulen hovered over the masses, <br>and screamed its last cry of death, but also of thanks. <br><br>      As this god graduated to higher positions, he left behind many tokens. <br><br> Multiple items were left by his cohorts.  These minions of doom terrorized, <br>but were felled by the might of many on the Tribunal.  All Hail God Atruelen, <br>and may you rest in peace, as you leave this plane of existence. <br><br><br>      /OOC: <br>      Tonight (November 3-4), GM Atruelen left the Tribunal.  He has a new <br>job now, but many will miss him. <br><br>      In his final event, multiple high level specters and other creatures, <br>controlled by other GMs and Guides, fought.  No experience was gained or <br>lost, as far as most could tell (although some claim otherwise), but all had <br>fun.  Wizards and druids were kept VERY busy teleporting dead people back, <br>and never once did they charge. <br><br>      Although I only attended the last third of the event (as I did not <br>know the rest had occurred), the amazing power of these things was <br>astounding.  Yon To, a skeletal shadow knight, kept things interesting along <br>with a fellow Skeletal Paladin, as they dueled, and killed PCs by the <br>hundreds.  The Planes hardly compared to the carnage at the Wizard Pyramid in <br>Nektulos Forest.  A plot for the regular person would be to zone in, see Yon <br>To, live long enough for him to cast once or twice on you, and then return to <br>home point, only to try it again. <br><br>      Eventually, these two were slain.  Miggn was the name of the Paladin, <br>I believe. <br><br>      Then, Atruelen's Ghost arose.  It took a substantially less amount of <br>time for this one to be killed, as everyone was coordinated into a myriad of <br>groups. <br><br>      I died once, and had time to TP back into WC, and run back.  In the <br>end, I landed the final blow, and since there was no loot rules for this, got <br>the loot before any realized it was dead.  (No, I did NOT Ninja-loot) <br>      In any event, dropped was the following: <br><br>      Bracer of Scavenging <br>      Mithril Breastplate <br>      Mithril 2-Handed Sword <br>      Bag of the Sewn Evil Eye <br>      Cobalt Boots <br>      Hammerhead Helm <br><br>      Menuven <br>      The Tribunal <br>      (Dragon2120@aol.com) <br><br>      P.S.  Good Luck, Atruelen.  We'll miss you!! </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the news!

Kgar informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>On Thursday Nov. 2nd on Saryrn, there was a GM hosted event.<br><br>It took place in OOT at the sister island docks.<br><br>There were many Mermaids at the docks coxing people to go in the water and<br>swim with them and play with them.  <br><br>Upon doing so many people where attacked by the playful mermaids.<br><br>The mermaids were GM run and thus would interact and talk to you and giggle<br>at you and in general seem to want to have some fun.<br><br>Some of those on shore did what MOST EQ players would do.. saw them then<br>ATTACKED them.. so its no wonder they defended themselves and killed many of<br>those that attacked.<br><br>They even attacked Hava a level 20 Guide and spanked him a few times.. and<br>even killed him one time hehe.<br><br>It was a GREAT ROLE PLAYING event<br><br>I feel that many more could have had fun if they did not resort to trying to<br>KILL the mermaids at the FIRST option..   as soon as the mermaids where<br>noticed OOCs to the zone went out to come group and KILL them all.<br><br>Many items where taken from them the 3 I know of are EB mace, EE bag and<br>Ruined Circlet.    I received both an EE bag and a Circlet for being nice to<br>the mermaids and swimming with them and dancing and in general having fun in<br>the role playing event.. and for trying to protect them.  The rest of the<br>items taken at the event, I believe, were taken off the corpses of the poor<br>mermaids.<br><br><br>Kgar (my ogre shaman, 52) had lots of fun at the event in the form of role<br>playing.  Here is a bit of what happened.  <br><br><br>I heard people in the area calling out that mermaids where a the docks and<br>to come see what was going on.  I ran over to see what was and noticed about<br>7 mermaids near shore by the docks.<br><br>I asked the ladies what they where doing and they asked me to go swimming<br>with them.  I was not sure what all they wanted, so I tried to talk to them<br>more..  Allwett smiled at me and giggled and waved at me and blew me a<br>kiss..  so I jumped in the water to play with the nice ladies.  It would<br>seem however that Splash did not like ogres smelling up the water and<br>slapped me around pretty good.  Seeing as she did not seem to want me in the<br>water I got out.  All the mermaids where giggling and dancing and having<br>fun.  I tried to explain I was a nice ogre and would not hurt them.  They<br>(as well as those others on shore of course would never believe an ogre is<br>nice or kind) did not believe me and when I came close to the water again<br>Splashy blew me a big kiss (knocked me back half way across the island and<br>stunned me for a good 2 minutes).. what a kiss!!!  After that I went back to<br>the waters edge and talked to them some more.  In general they mermaids<br>still wanted me to play with them in the water.  I was about to go back in<br>when some Necro attacked one of the mermaids.  I of course jumped up and did<br>my best to help the poor mermaid.  I healed her as best I could and she,<br>with her sisters managed to fight off the necros pet and force the necro<br>away from the shore.<br><br>The necro was very made at me for helping the ladies.  I guess he had<br>nothing but greed and evil in his heart and tried to kill another one of the<br>mermaids.  Splash was the victim this time and many of those on shore jumped<br>in and attacked her.  Allwett and a few other mermaids asked me to help them<br>out and I did my best.  But one shamans magic is not enough to stop a horde<br>of people.  Slashy was chased out of the reach of my magics and was slain<br>somewhere deep in the waters off the docks.  This was very said..  But even<br>with the loss of one of their sisters the mermaids still wanted us to play<br>with them.  <br><br>A few others braved the waters to see the mermaids up close,  maybe too<br>close, I am not sure.  All I know is they must have displeased some of the<br>mermaids as most who entered the ended up being attacked.  I do not know the<br>details, these people may have been part of the first who showed up and<br>attacked the ladies.  I do know that mermaids play HARD when they first get<br>to know you, and maybe if you are not tough enough to endure their playing,<br>you are not tough enough to endure the depths of the ocean, thus not able to<br>play with the ladies in their own elements.  <br><br>A few of us had fun dancing and playing in the water with the mermaids, but<br>a few people seemed hell bent on killing them, some for the sake of killing<br>anything that moves and others outa pure greed and lust to take the few<br>items they had with them.<br><br>I was threatened with my life by many of those on the shore, outraged that I<br>would help the ladies.  Only a few supported peace and enjoyed the fun time<br>the mermaids wanted to share.<br><br>In the end I was to weak to hold of the ever growing hordes of people<br>wishing nothing more than to kill the beauty that swam in the ocean and<br>wanted nothing more than to spend a short time with us and have some fun.<br><br>I mourned the death of the mermaids and left the area before those cheering<br>on shore remembered I had helped save the mermaids.  I manage to leave<br>mostly unharmed, but with the great memories of the fun I had partaken in<br>with the mermaids.  Also the sadness of the loss of life.<br><br>I hope to see more mermaids some day, and hope that maybe the next time they<br>me be able to have their fun and leave in peace.<br><br>Kgar Z`Confused<br>The Kind ogre of Saryrn</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

From Dr. Flamer:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail,<br> <br>After a long time in this game, and a long time on boards I tend to see lots of flames, and rantings by people who inevitably get kicked off that board only to take it to another board and another board until they are eventually so fed up that they take it out on others and forever remain bitter...  Meanwhile, the board admins are left to look like bad guys for deleting and/or locking posts due to their content.<br> <br>I think there should be a solution for this... so, I made one.  I call the message board EverFlames.  Its dedicated to the players who just need to let it out, without fear of censorship, banning, or locked threads.  There are forums for each server, and a few general forums relating to certain aspects of the game itself.<br> <br>So, I encourage all those who are admins to boards, rather than saying, "Not on my board!" *ban* Say, "Take it to EverFlame!" *ban*<br> <br>Here's that link for ya!<br><a href="http://pub31.ezboard.com/beverflames">http://pub31.ezboard.com/beverflames</a><br> <br>Thanks,<br>Dr. Flamer</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

This means no cultural armor for small race rogues, druids, casters, etc. <br>4. Imbued dwarven plate recipes do not work- even though they are described in game by an NPC (Tortuk Everhot in North Kaladim). <br><br>Dwarves cannot (at this point) make any imbued armor without the assistance of a non-dwarf.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Several posts were written today by Verant's Gordon Wrinn.  Here are quotes and excerpts of them directly from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028157.html"><b>Hybrid Experience Solution?</b></a><br>Yes, it is possible to use math to see that levels don't move around. It's *possible* to do virtually anything given sufficient resources. That said, as mentioned in the FAQ, the experience system is not subject to post-production changes. The experinece system as it exists is part of the game that we will not modify. <br><br>It's not appropriate for me to continue trying to make arguments to justify the differing experience requirements, as that suggests that something could happen that would cause us to change our minds. The experience system, as it exists, is absolutely firm: As firm as the game's name being "EverQuest", or it being a game that encourages grouping. <br><br>I've tried to address this issue in the past through a number of different methods, but what it comes down to is that it absolutly will not be changed. I am indeed sorry if you disagree.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028089.html"><b>EQ a Level 50+ Club Now?</b></a><br>Please remember that the lower levels are a transitional period. People move through them, and once they are through them, they move on to other places. For this reason, there's always been suitable in-game content for lower level folks, as people keep moving out of the lower levels. <br><br>It's the high level game that is most in need of new content due to the growing number of "members" of that range. <br><br>That said, we'd certainly like to see more dynamic events for the lower level folks. We have the ability now to limit who can attack gm-controlled NPCs, and it would definitely be nice to employ that more. Of course, that's gm-controlled NPCs only. Computer controlled NPCs remain attackable by everyone.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028083.html"><b>Burnout</b></a><br>Just my opinion, but if you play for the express purpose of maxing out, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Remember back before the level limit was raised when thousands of people were perfectly happy not to advance at all for months when they were 50th level, and how some of those same people got upset a week or two after we raised the limit when they weren't advancing fast enough. <br><br>If someone feels free to go out and have fun without advancement, I don't see why they can't do the same when advancement can occur. It's my feeling that if people play the game to adventure and hang out with friends like they were doing before they could advance, advancement would still occur without the need to look at the bar after each kill.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/027801.html"><b>Epic Quest Items</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You have yet to address the issue of the useless effect of the Necro Epic Weapon (beyond saying that the save per tick would be fixed). It is still a useless effect, can you please state if this has also been repaired, or does the necro community need to keep posting why this effect is trash? ]</i></font><br><br>Once the save per tick problem is fixed in the next patch, I completely disagree that a free darkness series spell is "useless". That series is one of the staples of the necromancer class, and a way to cast it once or twice, even with a long casting time, for free, is quite a boon. <br><br>I understand that there are those who disagree, but there have been people who've disagreed with the usefulness of every epic quest weapon that's been found so far. In short, it's not something we're considering changing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Agreed. Int doesn't have to be changed, but 40 more HP to give it 100 total HP/mana like the other weapons would be great.]</i></font> <br><br>We are modifying the stats on virtually all of the weapons, including the ones that haven't been found. I think that the cleric weapon is the only one that's not being modified.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/027981.html"><b>Dex and Procs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why is it that dex does not affect how a weapon procs???]</i></font> <br><br>It does. The example in your post is not a large enough model to see the difference. You could certainly proc 5 times in a row even with minimum dex, but the chance is far less. <br><br>Remember that previous successes or failures have nothing to do with the chance of future successes or failures. The fact that you just proc'd does not make the chance of your next proc any closer or further away, probabiltywise. <br><br>Regarding the random number generator, people think that because streaks happen that there's some problems. Random does not mean equal and regular distribution over the course of the sample. In any 10 flips of a coin you still have a .1% chance of never having it come up "heads". The fact that you may sit down and flip a coin 10 times and not get "heads" doesn't mean that your coin flip isn't random.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028004.html"><b>Daylight Savings</b></a><br>I've lived in Arizona and Indiana. <br><br>Indiana doesn't change because they are so close to the time line, that if they did it would still be light out at 10pm. <br><br>Michigan (where I've also lived) does change for daylight savings time. It's very eerie to be sitting outside at 10pm reading a book. <br><br>Arizona doesn't change due to the heat. Arizonan's don't want more "daylight" in their day. The sooner it gets dark in the summer the sooner it cools off and people can go outside. It gets dark around 8:30pm in the summer, and it's still frequently above 100F (~38C) at midnight. <br><br>But to answer your question, yes, we've changed our clocks. We're back to GMT-8.</UL>
