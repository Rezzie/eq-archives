<span class=dateline>April     22, 2003</span> - 	Aaqcutt Boggins arose from his short rest on a morning where the Butcherblock was soaked with rain. The skies were cloudy, the thunder rolled through the hills, and not a glimmer of sunshine could be seen. He descended the stairs of his Greybloom Farms home, dressed and ready for a hard day's labor on the mushroom pasture. As he reached the foot of the stairs, he was surprised when he looked up to see his young children sitting around his armchair!<BR>
<BR></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
	"Tell us more of the story, grandpa!" the young Burbkin explained with a beam on his face. "What about Adolen and Fognus?" As he said the name of his ancestor, he pointed to the portrait above the mantle of the dwarf, clad regally in robes and capes, his hand firmly placed on a scepter.<BR>
<BR>
	"Me Brell, youngins, ye are awake quite early! Ahh, but I cannot tell ye a story so early. I have things to tend to on the grounds." The young dwarves' faces drooped in sadness.<BR>
<BR>
	"Not today, you don't, Aaqcutt Boggins." The voice was that of Grandma Flora as she descended the stairs, still clad in her nightgown. "Tell the youngins of Adolen's story. The farm can wait."<BR>
<BR>
	Aaqcutt smiled wide. It had been as though he was simply waiting for the nod from his wife to continue the story from last night. "Very well, youngins. Very well." He walked slowly to his armchair, talking as he moved. "Where were we? Ah, yes, I remember now."<BR>
<BR>
 ***<BR>
<BR>
	Adolen and Fognus sat in the Pub Kal, sipping ale. At least, Fognus was sipping ale. Adolen sat wide-eyed with interest.<BR>
<BR>
	"I don't remember much of ye, Adolen, except the locket that mama put around your neck." He gave a flick to the locket around the young dwarf's neck. "Ye see, I was only seven or so years of age when you were born, and you weren't around but for a short while." Adolen stared straight ahead. His face was emotionless.<BR>
<BR>
	"Why? What happened to me?" Adolen had snapped back to his senses after a few seconds of silence.<BR>
<BR>
	"You were stolen from your crib. I didn't see it with my own eyes, but papa told me of it later. Something, someone, clad in a black cloak stole you from your crib and vanished before papa could stop him."<BR>
<BR>
	Adolen's face began burning a bright red as his thoughts drifted toward the black cloak that so often adorned his "father's" throne room. He stood upviolently and made for the door. Fognus dropped his ale and ran to his brother. "What are ye doing?! Where are ye going?!" Fognus pulled at his young sibling harder still. Adolen turned to Fognus solemnly, his eyes filled with an indescribable rage. "The person who stole me from my crib was Meldrath the Malignant. I must finish what he started."<BR>
<BR>
	"That's suicide, Adolen!" Fognus was no longer pulling the younger dwarf, he was nearly dragging him. "Meldrath the Malignant is a powerful necromancer! He could destroy you with a single thought!" Adolen pulled away from Fognus with all of his might. "I don't care," he said. "I'm going to finish him or die trying."<BR>
<BR>
	"Perhaps you should sit down," Fognus said. "Mama and papa wouldn't want you to commit suicide, Adolen. They would want you to go on with your life. There will be time for vengeance." Adolen turned sadly to his brother. "Mama? Papa? My parents. Where are they?" Fognus opened his mouth and quickly closed it. "Sit down, Adolen," said Fognus. Adolen obeyed. Fognus joined him in short order.<BR>
<BR>
	"Mama and Papa are dead." Fognus looked down at the table, a solemn frown on his face. Adolen glanced at his brother and noticed a single tear rolling down a cheek. Fognus paused for a moment, expecting Adolen to say something. The room, however, remained silent.<BR>
<BR>
	"Mama disappeared a few days after you vanished. The constables found some of her clothing washed up on the cliff near the shore. As for papa...he was murdered returning from Kelethin by a band of orcs." It seemed like an eternity until Fognus spoke again. "Tell me Adolen, of how you came to be a member of Meldrath's court."<BR>
<BR>
	Adolen smirked. "I was no member of his court, Fognus. I was a slave. He called me his son, but I knew that I was no child of his. I was forced to scrub the floors of the caves as the hooves of the minotaur trampled around me. I spent my days in a cold chamber, lingering with the realization that I would never leave. At least, that's what I thought. With the help of another slave, I left those minotaur caves and made my way here. I'm not sure what I expected to find."<BR>
<BR>
	Fognus ordered some food for their table and they ate in solitude for nearly an hour. Finally, and with much hesitation, Fognus spoke. "Revenge is...something to be avoided, brother. We have Meldrath to thank for many of our hardships, but...well, don't seek revenge for it. No good can come of it." Adolen turned his head to Fognus. His brow furrowed, and when he spoke, it would have made young children wimper and grown women shriek. "You know NOTHING of hardships, Fognus. Don't even THINK you have half an inkling of what revenge is." Fognus recoiled from the change in his brother's voice. "Listen, Adolen," he said, "this is not the path you need to go. Mama and papa are gone and they'll never return. Our brothers have all gone on to paths of their own. You need to choose a path as well."<BR>
<BR>
	Adolen glanced again at Fognus, then looked forward again. His voice had returned to normal by the time he spoke. "Perhaps. But this is my first night back. It can wait, can't it? I have much to see. My childhood home, a pub or two more...maybe we can exchange stories."<BR>
<BR>
 "Maybe," Fognus said with a smile.<BR>
<BR>
 ***<BR>
<BR>
 	It was one week later. Adolen had been staying at Fognus's apartment in Stormguard Hall. The butlers of the hall had made arrangements for him and had been most polite. Adolen had spoken with the guild masters of the rogue, cleric, warrior, and paladin guilds and had read and studied their charters. When Fognus returned home from his training, Adolen was holding the cleric charter in his hand with a smile on his face.<BR>
<BR>
 	"This is it, Fognus. This is the path I want to pursue!" Fognus smiled wider than anyone had ever seen him smile before in all his life. "Adolen, that's wonderful! You'll love the life of a cleric. Helping others, spreading joy, bringing justice." Adolen's mind was racing at the implications. He was clearly pleased with his choice.<BR>
<BR>
 	"Adolen, I will arrange a meeting with Priestess Galia to test your ability for the divine powers that a cleric possesses."<BR>
<BR>
	 It was custom with children to be christened not long after birth with the class that they would follow into their future. However, since Adolen was 46 years old, far beyond the normal christening age, the Council of Kaladim had ordained that he could decide the path he was to take and that his abilities would then be tested.<BR>
<BR>
 ***<BR>
<BR>
 	Adolen was kneeled before the Priestess's alter. Fognus stood in the shadows near the door to avoid being involved in any of the questioning that was taking place.<BR>
<BR>
 	"Do you feel," Priestess Galia began, "that you have been truly blessed by Brell, young Adolen?"<BR>
<BR>
 "Else I would not be here, Priestess," Adolen said.<BR>
<BR>
 	A beadle of the church of Kaladim descended the stairs and handed Adolen a scroll. He then produced a dagger and stabbed himself with it. Priestess Galia pointed at the young dwarf. "Scribe that scroll," she said, "and heal the beadle. With that, your trial will be complete."<BR>
<BR>
 	Sweat began to gather on Adolen's forehead. He sat and began to copy the scroll. "May I practice the incantation a few times, m' lady?" Priestess Galia nodded. Adolen stood, and, glancing in his spellbook, mumbled the incantation.<BR>
<BR>
 He failed once.<BR>
<BR>
Twice.<BR>
<BR>
Three times.<BR>
<BR>
	On the fourth time, he casted it successfully. Sweat beading on his forehead, he looked down and said the incantation over and over, confining it to his mind. He closed his spell book and set it down. With a great deal of concentration, he closed his eyes, moved his arms in the incantation, and casted the spell.<BR>
<BR>
He failed.<BR>
<BR>
	A blue light washed over the beadle, healing him totally. The church official looked down in amazement at his wounds as they sealed up and closed together. Priestess Galia grew wide-eyed with amazement. "Priest Adolen, you are accepted enthusiastically into the church!" Adolen's jaw dropped in amazement, and in the corner, Fognus smiled and put his spellbook away.<BR>
<BR>
 ***<BR>
<BR>
	Adolen left wearing a tunic with a symbol of Brell Serilis emblazened on the chest. He carried a small club and his spellbook. "Ye did great, Adolen," said Fognus. "Ye did great."<BR>
<BR>
	"What now, Fognus?" Adolen was still smiling. "Well...you have to start somewhere. Go out to yonder mountains and start fighting with the minor animals. Learn your craft and start practicing it."<BR>
<BR>
	"What about you, Fognus?" Fognus smiled. "I am headed to Crushbone. The war against the orcs continues to rage on."<BR>
<BR>
Adolen turned his face forward again and began walking to Kaladim's exit.<BR>
<BR>
	Over the next two years, Adolen worked as hard as Fognus had advised him. He rarely saw his eldest brother any longer, as Fognus had traveled to Antonica to battle the threats of Guk. He had, however, met his brother Gagness, who had been referred to Adolen through Fognus.<BR>
<BR>
	Adolen had now experienced around 8 seasons in the cleric hierarchy. He had gone to Crushbone in the past, taking arms against the ever-growing threats in the Orcish community. He had forged unbreakable frienships with elves, gnomes, humans, and had seen more in his life than many would ever see. In his 6th season, he had journeyed with a group of adventurers to visit Qeynos and Halas and later returned to Faydwer to continue his quest against the orcs. He was even conspiring, alongside the Council of Faydwer, to assassinate Emperor Crush. Adolen had risen to a respectable status among the residents of Kaladim, and had even raised enough money to buy his childhood home of Greybloom. It seemed as though he was caught in a euphoria.<BR>
<BR>
But things are not always what they seem.<BR>
<BR>
	Adolen was plagued nearly every evening with terrifying nightmares from his past with Meldrath, and they were growing darker as time passed. He was on a downward spiral to insanity.<BR>
<BR>
 ***<BR>
<BR>
	Meldrath the Malignant moved his hands over his crystal ball. The image of his dwarven son was flowing through the ethereal glass. He smiled wider and wider.<BR>
<BR>
"Yes, Adolen. You will come to me soon. And all will be right again."<BR>
<BR>
 ***<BR>
<BR>
	Aaqcutt glanced at the gnomish gift Adolen had received from King Akanon: a clockwork clock. It was already well into the night.<BR>
<BR>
"Blah," Aaqcutt blurted out, "a hard day's work wasted!"<BR>
<BR>
"T'were no waste, grandpapa!" said the young Dwizkin.<BR>
<BR>
	Aaqcutt smiled. He knew that the day had not truly been wasted as long as the young ones were happy. Flora was cleaning up the dishes in the kicthen, and Aaqcutt caught her shooting a gleaming smile at him.<BR>
<BR>
	"Your old grandpa has to be resting now," Flora said. The young children groaned in sadness and crawled into their tiny beds. Aaqcutt headed upstairs to bed as Flora remained to finish the dishes.<div class=byline>-- <a href="mailto:jkennedy@eudoramail.com">Adolen Palum'Diabolus</A></div>
