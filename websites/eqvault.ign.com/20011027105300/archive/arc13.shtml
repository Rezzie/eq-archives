More bits and pieces of info are hot off the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000218.html"><b>Fan Faire Scrapbook</b></a><br>Mennix has been updating the Fan Faire Scrapbook. Our intrepid little 'fling took some nice pictures while in Minneapolis, and you can see them in our scrapbook. <br><br>Run over and take a look!<br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/scrapbook.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/scrapbook.jsp</a> <br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000219.html"><b>Reporting Mana</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: responce to mana reporting <br><br>Alan, you are correct, it is not hard to report mana. It is also not hard to have to click on food to eat it and it is not hard to have to hit the "run" button everytime you started an EQ session. Why are these things not part of the game? It is because they are tedious. It is tedious to have to ask for a mana check and it is tedious to report it. <br><br>When I hear you say it is not hard to report mana, I hear Abashi when he was asked why the "run" button cannot be pressed by default. (this was a while ago) He said something along the lines of "how hard can it be to hit one button when you start the game? (not an exact quote) I beleive this attitude was one of his major flaws as an internet communications representative. When someone asks for something to make the game less tedious, I beleive it should be examined without your own personal bias as to whether or not it is "necessary". <br><br>There are many things that are not in the game because they are tedious. I beleive this should be examined as one of those things. If you want to tell me it is not going to be imnplemented for technical reasons, that is fine; but please, look at it without your own personal bias as to whether or not you feel it is necessary. <br><br>I hope I didn't cause any hard feelings with this reply. Hopefully we can still be buds after you're done reading this. I'll buy you one of your favorite drink at any tavern of your choice, as long as it is in Kaladim. :)<br><br>Whim<br>Emarr]</i></font> <br><br>In keeping with my promise, I'm moving this topic to its own thread. Hook into this thread: <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000195.htm">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000195.htm</a>> for more details. You'll have to wade a bit, it's not a one topic thread&#8230; :)<br><br>There is, and always will be, a fine line between tedious and fiction-breaking. Personally, I'm still against the idea that people spend their whole lives running in Norrath, and I don't like the idea that you can have running on when you log in, and yet right now you can't set a default language in the same way&#8230; It makes more sense to me for your character to 'wake up' walking rather than running, and for trolls to 'wake up' talking in trollish rather than common. <br><br>If it helps, I will never set my default to run when I enter the world. <br><br>But those are my opinions (and, I think, ones that I'll express to the team in a quick e-mail, now that you've got me thinking about it again&#8230; :)). <br><br>What players have been asking for (for those of you just tuning in) is the ability to use a %m in macros that would report their percentage of remaining mana. We've said that we don't intend to do that. The reason is basically two-fold. The primary reason is that people living in the world of Norrath don't use phrases like "Hail, %t. I am ready for the next pull, as my mana is at %m." The secondary is, well, we like the vague nature of the mana bar. We don't show the numbers, and that leaves us disinclined to show percentages either. <br><br>I hope that I have been clear with everyone with the differences between my personal opinions (which may or may not match those of the company or the players, and doesn't need to) and the opinions of the Development Team that I represent. I always try to make certain that I am clear when telling you what I think and what we are doing and why. <br><br>Right now, we don't plan to add a feature for reporting mana in any form. The difference in the level of 'tedium' between typing "/g 60" and hitting a macro is relatively minor. And we think that things are better as they are. <br><br>That doesn't mean we aren't willing to listed to discussion on the matter. But that is the decision we came to at the last Tuning meeting when this idea was brought up. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Comment on Casters Mana... <br><br>All Casters have their Own strategy. Some like to keep 20-30% for Emergency's, or for critical situation... I for one like to tell my group I have less than I really have, so that encounters are a bit safer... why ? Cause I've had groups pulling 2-3 mobs with me at 50%... which turned disastrous. So to compensate, I will say lower and hope that if they pull this off again... The difference will save the group. <br><br>Well, if everyone in the Group could see your mana bar... You would have those telling you how to use your magic, and when to use it... and some telling you you're a morron for using it and not leaving mana for emergency's and so on.... <br><br>So, in my opinion... I don't have a problem telling my group how much mana I have... This is my personal power, and I'd like to keep it as personal as possible. <br><br>My 2cp. ]</i></font><br><br>Showing actual mana bars to the whole party isn't really being considered. This isn't because we advocate lying to your party about your mana&#8230; in fact I'd suggest that your better off educating them about why you do what you do than keeping them in the dark. <br><br>We don't plan to do it because we just don't see mana level as something that people would be able to determine by glancing at you during a fight.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000220.html"><b>Sit</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: All I keep asking is will my doggie sit when I'm in wolf form in Luclin ?<br>Just a "yes"/"no"/"we're thinking about it" would be nice. <br><br>Mell ]</i></font><br><br>Maybe&#8230; <br><br>This is something that we want to add, along with a ton of other neato ideas. Unfortunately the list of neato ideas is always longer than is realistically possible. We're certainly thinking about it, but we won't know if it is going in until it actually goes in.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000221.html"><b>Minor Illusion</b></a><br>Oisin_McCuhal wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I know this was explained a long time ago but I was wondering about why minor illusion became stationary. It was quite fun to see a bed running across the EC or WC. I was wondering about the possibility of minor illusion becoming mobile again. BTW this change happened back before there was so much whining and complaining and also predates any expansion. ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, it happened during beta. The reason for it is pretty simple. Most of the models that you turn into using minor illusion (maybe all of them) were built to be stationary. They don't have any animations, and they used to cause people to get stuck all over the place when you could move. They would sometimes cause people to fall under the world too. There wasn't any way to fix it so that all of the beds and barrels in Norrath were able to function while animated, so the best solution was to prevent people from moving with the spell.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000222.html"><b>Gloves of Fire</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings gentlemen there. <br><br>My problem: Gloves of Fire (some stats, effect, no drop, mag/wiz) that *censored* drops in *censored*.<br>If you put these gloves on HIE or GNM they are awesome looking. The colour is bright , even neon red. _The_ best looking gloves in the game.<br>I was so thrilled when I got a pair of these. And I was sorely disappointed when I put them on. They have a reddish, quite dark brown colour when they are on Dark elf hands. :(<br><br>Why is this? Why do they look so godly on other races and on dark elf they look like you had been grovelling in mud a moment ago? Is there any way to get them look on DEF the same as they look on HIE? Is this a bug or just a bad feature because of some shading in graphics or such? <br><br>I know, there is a plethora of more important things in the game yes. This one just happened to affect me much. I was looking forward to them and I have red dress and those 2 glowing red globes and the neon red fiery gloves would have been exellent for my outlook. Now it's not so. Please (on my knees) could you ask quickly about this from the graphics guy? Is there any way to get these gloves look like they should on Dark Elfs? <br><br>You know the saying (CP 2.0.2.0): Style before everything. <br><br>Thank you for your time and keep up the good work there. <br><br>Sincerely<br>*******************<br>Dthamilaye K'Tang, 54th magician in Tunare <br><br>PS. I wouldn't say no if You could give us mages the improved invis too :)]</i></font><br><br>The answer is a little complicated. <br><br>Each race has a look, a texture, to their armor pieces. When tinting a piece of armor that tinting is, basically, placed on top of that texture (blended with it, sorta). So the actual color of the armor after the tinting won't be uniform for each race that wears it. This is, really, a good thing, adding variety to the armors that we create. But it also means that there is no way to get a uniform look across all the races. <br><br>And, well, sorry about the Improved Invisibility thing. You get advantages, and you get disadvantages. Not having Improved Invisibility is one of the disadvantages.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000216.html"><b>Magic Concerns</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I just have one concern. Will the NPC's be getting the anti-gate spells? <br><br>Thuldorn ]</i></font><br><br>No, NPCs will not be getting this spell (and not so much because we don't want them to, but more for technical reasons). And, no, these spells will not work on player characters in PvP either, for the same technical reasons. <br><br>Because of the fact that the spell would be a problem to code to work on player characters, we've never needed to discuss whether or not we want it to work on player characters&#8230; I think it would be fun, but that's just me. :)</UL>

For your reading pleasure we bring you today's installment to the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>More Sullon Zek Talk</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: BUG: When dueling someone outside your PvP range, you cannot loot their corpse. <br><br>Joyous<br>SZ<br>Anarchy ]</i></font><br><br>Why would that seem like a bug to you? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: please apologize my poor english <br><br>Was wondering is the enchanteur class was not going to be the main looser in this server :<br>1) it seems that generally, enchanters get hard time in PVP mainly because of high MR at higher levels. This partly stems from intense item trading (which does not appear to be discouraged in the new server).<br>2) they cannot be agnostic anymore....spell collection & quest (not to mention daylife) will be greatly hindered)<br>3) as people now con ally or threatening, illusions wont be as effective as they were before on other PVP servers<br>4) their jewels are more and more outfashionned by items to be looted in velious (not a secific problem of this server though)<br>5)enchanters are the sole caster that cannot either sow or shadowstep or let a good pet intercepting in case of sudden attack. this increase the consequences of point 3) <br><br>I dont know if this is feasible but.....a mere "agnostic" enchantment could solve part of these problems (2&3 as above reffered). This spell would let them appearing as being agnostic for a while (suppressing the religious factor and not theatenning to another human player). Nothing against having this spell being broken when attacking as invisibility does. ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, it will probably be a little harder to be an enchanter on Sullon than on other PvP servers. <br><br>1) We've addressed that already by increasing the debuffs to 1.5 times their effectiveness on player characters.<br>2) This will indeed make things harder for enchanters. However, they will still have a bit of a lock on jewelcraft, and I suspect that deals will be made&#8230;<br>3) Not really comparable. On the team servers you can distinguish someone by the color of their name, and illusions do cover that. But on Sullon there are no colored names to cover, and your race does not always determine your team. An evil enchanter illusioned as a human will appear the same to anyone as any other evil human&#8230;<br>4) Unrelated to PvP or Sullon&#8230;<br>5) This won't be any better or worse on Sullon than on any other PvP server. <br><br>Appearing as agnostic would be worse than appearing as the team you are on. Agnostics would be a forth team, if anything, and not on all teams. We might talk about a spell for suppressing religion, but such a spell would probably be way too powerful on Sullon. <br><br>Adesina wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: According to what you have said, beneficial spells only work w/in a certain level range of the caster. Is this true for bind affinity? I personally think that is one spell that anyone (anyone who can, that is) should be able to cast on any team member who needs it. There is really no logical reason to have the level gap apply to this spell as well, since the level of the caster doesn't effect the actual bind in any way. Just curious. Thanks :)]</i></font><br><br>Not a problem. The system is set up so that spells won't work on anyone twenty levels below the level of the spell. So it won't be a problem for any spell under 20th level, such as Bind Affinity. <br><br>Rubikoob wrote:<br> <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've given it some thought, and I think you are probably right. The majority of players will most likely decide first on a team and then on a class, or vice versa, relegating their selection of race and deity to whatever options are then left to them. <br><br>*musing* <br><br>I've also been considering the issue of team balance... and while there is merit to the idea of having an actual imbalance in the way teams are set up in order to establish a sort of "underdog" mentality in order to give more of an identity to the different teams, I think it would be better to have the system show no favorites and allow the players themselves to determine such traits. As it is now, Grobb and Oggok are a veritable stronghold of evil, separated by several zones from the nearest non-evil city, Freeport, which can hardly be considered unified against evil anyway. Grobb and Oggok sit right next to several of the most popular zones in the game... Oasis and Guk, with Cazic-Thule thrown in there as a nice upper-20's low-30's sort of dungeon. <br><br>Neutrals don't have quite as much of a consolidated stronghold, but they do have sole ownership of Kaladim as well as the potential for a very strong presence in Greater Faydark and Ak'Anon. In fact, the entire continent of Faydwer could potentially belong to neutrality. <br><br>The closest thing to a 'stronghold' that the good team has is Felwithe, stuck right in the middle of a continent teetering towards neutrality. It will be an uphill battle for them to establish and maintain a strong presence in Greater Faydark, and the neutrals won't give it up without a fight. Goodies really just don't have anywhere to call home, and I think they should. <br><br>Sorry for the length of this post, but thanks for still reading it if you got this far. <br><br>By the way, you craftily dodged my question regarding where the Vah Shir are going to fit into all of this. I think it's already been said that they are more or less a 'good' race, but do you think we could get any further comment, specifically regarding the Deity Wars server? <br><br>/musing ]</i></font><br><br>We've gone over this a LOT here. There really is no way to make the teams that works better than what we've got. We're also fairly certain that things will level out more as the server ages, but that's not something we'll have to wait on to see how it goes. <br><br>As for the Vah Shir question, I wasn't so much dodging as I was just not answering. No matter what decision we might make now (and we really haven't), we'd have to re-evaluate it later anyway to reflect the reality of the server after it's been up a while. So you we aren't really worrying about what team to put them on for a while yet. Though, as many have speculated, I imagine that they won't be on the evil team. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Choices in EverQuest: Roleplaying, Religion and More</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've learned to like the challenge of conformity. Without a GM actively making the lives of non-conformists (outcasts) difficult, it is too easy to play one. There are no behavior restrictions other than the ones the player chooses. No standards for others to base expectations on. Do whatever one wants and it's "roleplaying" an "outcast". <br><br>One of EQ's strengths is the diversity of archetypes to choose from. There is enough leeway within each basic race/class choice to personalize a PC. If a player has a specific role they want to play there is an archetype available. If a player has a specific race/class they want to play, then the challenge is to adapt a role that suits that choice. <br><br>My personal nature is such that I am inclined to help others in need (most of the time :)). In Norrathian terms "good" or "light". It's no stretch for me to roleplay a woodelf ranger. The challenge is to be _my_ woodelf ranger, and give him a personality beyond the archetype. With the release of Kunark the Iksar's caught my attention. I attempted to play an 'independent adventurer' not subject to the bias of his race/class (necro). Very easy for me to play. No real change from my woodelf ranger. This was not within the archetype's character. I felt something was missing from my roleplay experience, but it took a more skilled roleplayer to point the following out: <br><br>There was no challenge to play my assumed role. By removing my PC's behavioral boundaries I had also removed my characters depth. To act out a part one needs a stage, a scene, and/or other actors. By ignoring my character's pre-determined background, I ignored his setting. My PC's audience had no point of reference (they couldn't read my mind to learn my elaborate and contrived background). My performance couldn't be judged on it's believability. There was no way to determine if I was roleplaying, or just playing. <br><br>-=Reptanis ]</i></font><br><br>Wow. Well written. Thanks. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Without those consequences (making it hard to accomplish won't be a consequence, once you've done that, then things will be smooth sailing) you're unique Drizzt will be one of many Drizzts <br><br>So what? <br><br>See, this is just what I was talking about. You don't understand, and I can't seem to make you understand, and it's frustrating. But you have the inside track to making sure your status quo is maintained, while all I can do is sit out here and beat my head against the wall in frustration. :(<br><br>I'm not looking to be different from other players. I don't give a rat's backside about what the other players do. I'm looking to be different from the the starting fiction. If everybody else wants to do the same thing, that's fine with me. Let them. How is the game hurt by having a bunch of Drizzt clones running around? How is having a bunch of Drizzt clones on a blue server any different from the friendly Dark Elf Necros and Troll Shamans and Ogre Shadow Knights that are already on the blue servers? <br><br>There is no real way to roleplay an evil race/class on a blue server. Trolls threaten to eat my gnome warriorette, and she just runs up and hugs their knees. Why? Because it's a blue server and I know that no matter how tough they talk, and no matter how much they bluster and threaten, they can't do a thing to me. They can't REALLY be evil on a blue server. The best they can hope for is to get into an all-evil guild and minimize the amount of grouping they do with non-evils. <br><br>So since there's no way to REALLY be evil on a blue server, what's the difference between the friendly, chatty dark elf necros who exist by the dozens on any blue server and a friendly, chatty dark elf ranger who might (or might not) exist by the dozens if we had fewer racial class restrictions? These necros aren't paragons of evil magic and nefarious intent. They're personable, fun, helpful, and so on. If some of them were Rangers instead of Necros, so what? It wouldn't hurt anybody, and it would be a lot of fun for the player. And isn't that what this game is all about? Fun? <br><br>Ruatha Kneeslasher [Wings of Honor]<br>48th Level Gnome Warriorette<br>WARNING! I am a professional gnome, using special gnome equipment on an enclosed stunt server. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I do have the advantage when it comes to making changes to the existing game, as does anyone arguing for the status quo. But at the core my concern isn't just for the world of Norrath. We can take this discussion to levels abstract and I'll have the same opinion (and I'll be just as stubborn about it). <br><br>I can't find any further arguments that might persuade you that a herd of Drizzts is bad for any game, so I will cease trying. <br><br>As for your point about not being able to be 'evil' on a standard server, I agree with you. But, well, that's a point unrelated to the discussion about too many out of type characters harming a game. We could certainly spin off into a discussion about how to be evil on a non-PvP server and how PvP relates to roleplaying, but that would probably be too far off topic here. <br><br>The only point I have left is this. Yes, playing Drizzt_56 might be fun for you and the other 55 Drizzts on the server. But I can tell you that it would indeed make the game less fun for me, and I can find 55 other people that agree with me pretty easily. <br><br>That doesn't mean that you're wrong for finding that fun. But I'm not wrong either. And I (I believe) have the strength of the integrity of the world's fiction to sway the argument in my favor. <br><br>Sir_Yakk wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: So, make the 'difficult' quest mentioned easier a cake walk. <br><br>Require L 60.

Something that comes at the end of the character career and at the expense of the identity of the character. If such a change is allowed before the player has had much time to develop the character's personality, then the intervening levels just become a barrier to fun, and why not just allow those choices from the beginning. <br><br>If the barrier was so great that only one Drizzt would appear on a server every few months or years, then I'd be all for it. Those characters would indeed be unique, and would not appear with such frequency as to make the evil dark elves a minority. <br><br>BUT, well, tacking such a thing on to EverQuest now would be a nightmare. <br><br>I do agree though, that a Norrath with a rare unique character would be a better place. In a way that is the reason that lotteries are so popular. Not because you know anyone that has actually won, but because the winners that you've heard of across the country are people that you can hope to be one day. Such is the power of legend and myth, and on such things are games like EverQuest built.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000202.html"><b>Spells and Vendors</b></a><br>BigBurp_AFK wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I happened to be in EC yesterday so I picked up this spell (I'm a troll shaman) so that I would have it when the patch goes live.

Gordon Wrinn fired off a new update on the Developer's Board tackling PvP issues that are being "misinterpreted" by other sites.  Here's the complete post:<UL>Hello all,<br><br>It&#8217;s apparent that as a result of the Fan Faire this weekend in Minneapolis, inaccurate information regarding our PvP plans for the future were released and/or misinterpreted. <br><br>That has always been one of the difficulties of having a real-time interactive discussion where one doesn&#8217;t have the time to think about the precise wording of their answers. However, what we gain through the interactive forum makes it worth the effort, even when things appear to come out wrong like they did in the PvP panel this weekend. <br><br>For the most part, regarding the information that has since shown up on web sites, it appears that when it was mentioned that we &#8220;discussed&#8221; an issue, it was interpreted as &#8220;we are doing this&#8221;. The fact is, we discuss a TON of things when we&#8217;re driven to improve one area of the game. If you name it, we&#8217;ve probably discussed it at one time or another. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that what we discussed has either been decided or shot down, just that we&#8217;ve given it some measure of consideration in the past. <br><br>So, with that in mind, here&#8217;s the quote-by-quote clarification of the story on Castersrealm (eq.castersrealm.com) and RallosZek.net. (www.ralloszek.net). <br><br>Quote from Article: In approximately one week, PvP 'rules' will be as on Sullon Zek. In other words, there are no rules with respect to PvP. Standard blue server rules apply and sexual/racial harassment will not be tolerated. Everything else (training/bind point camping/exp killing, etc) will be completely legal. No PvP related petitions will be handled by the CS staff. The standard blue server type problems such as lost corpses, bugs, lost items, etc will still be handled.<br><br>Clarification: Sure, we discussed it, much like we discuss anything. As we were putting together the ruleset for Sullon Zek, someone suggested that we role it out across Sullon first and see how that goes and role it across the other servers if it works out. Will it go across the other servers? We don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ll have to see how it goes on Sullon first.<br><br>Quote From Article: ShowEQ is actively being pursued to be 'fixed' <br><br>Clarification: As actively as &#8220;bang for the buck&#8221; allows. We really need to do something revolutionary and complex in our next attempt to address the problem. It&#8217;s just a matter of having enough time to implement and test that. Timeframe? Mid-term, probably prior to Luclin&#8217;s launch.<br><br>Quote from Article: Classes are being re-examined for viability in a PvP environment. Lady Daegarmo specifically mentioned rangers as being one of the classes that is woeful in PvP.<br><br>Clarification: &#8230;with nothing specific planned and nothing beyond minor tweaks, certainly nothing class-redefining planned. Regarding rangers there was talk about improving archery, but that was spoken of with plans to put something out across all servers rather than just as a PvP-related improvement. The truth is, the classes are not balanced for one-on-one PvP, no more than they are balanced for one-on-one PvE (Player versus Environment). If you have to fight as part of a group to be successful in PvE, you&#8217;ll most likely have to do so with PvP. Yes, this does mean that a solo melee player will be at a disadvantage when meeting casters, especially those configured for solo play, and yes, that is part of the plan.<br><br>Quote from the Article: Lady Daegarmo is pushing for the return of egg shaped pumice on vendors for approx 200P each<br><br>Clarification: Oh it&#8217;s been pushed, but has yet not been taken up by the dev team for consideration. We&#8217;re kind of like the supreme court that way :)<br><br>Quote from Article: It was noted that Harm Touch and Lay Hands are on the same spell function with opposite effects so there's no way to give Lay Hands back to paladins on death while restricting the same recycle on HT<br><br>Clarification: Not entirely accurate. The reuse time is not tied to the spell effect, not to mention that each ability is treated as a skill by the game and uses its own reuse timer. The reason it&#8217;s not being done is not a matter of technical unfeasibility, but rather a specific design decision not to. Both are easy to exploit. The level to which they can be exploited is acceptable on the PvE servers and not acceptable on the PvP servers. <br><br>Quote from Article: Cross teaming is coming to an end. Teams (see later notes) will be locked down. There will be no ability to crossteam at all. No grouping, guilding, buffing, etc with non-team members. This lockdown is probably 60 days out. (I stated that the Development team would make an official date on the lock down in which they would give a minimal of 30 day notice. I also stated that I doubted you would see these changes within the next 2 months.)<br><br>Clarification: Yep, we&#8217;re planning on addressing cross-teaming, probably through locking down the teams. However, the specifics on how this will be done, along with what if any beneficial abilities will be allowed to cross any lock down is still being discussed. Opinions are welcome.<br><br>Quote from Article: The lockdown will entail a guildwipe. All guilds will be deleted and must be reformed. There will be extra staff for the first few days after the wipe to assist in this endeavour<br><br>Clarification: If we decided to do the most severe lockdown (no cross-guilding), then this would probably be the case. However something like this won&#8217;t be decided until we decide what kind of lockdown we&#8217;ll do.<br><br>Quote from Article: It is highly likely that common (the language) will be removed from the racewar servers for general communication use (i.e., public channels). Training in non-team languages will also receive very low caps.<br><br>Clarification: No. While this was one of the many thing suggested as part of a panel discussion, it has only been discussed as one of the many possible options for an &#8220;RP Server&#8221;, for lack of a better term, by the development team. The &#8220;RP Server&#8221;, by the way, will not be PvP. Those looking for PvP rules similar to an &#8220;RP Server&#8221; should look towards Sullon Zek.<br><br>Quote from Article: Strong possibility of adding a long (40 or so hours) quest to change your team. Certain classes/races would not be allowed to join certain teams (such as a Paladin joining the evil team).<br><br>Clarification: No. It was one of the suggestions brought up by players in the panel discussion, and has not been discussed by the development team. However, I can say with some certainty that this probably won&#8217;t happen.<br><br>Quote from Article: TZ likely to be changed to a 2 team server (Good vs. Evil). VZ may be changed to a 3 team server<br><br>Clarification: These were &#8216;off the cuff&#8217; examples of how a lock down could possibly be accomplished, rather than an indication of the direction planned.

Here's what Alan wrote on the Developer's Corner today in response to the feedback generated by players:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar and Religion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Since the discussion of the definition of 'agnostic' in relation to Norrath has come up, I thought I might as well through in my 2 copper pieces. I think 'agnostic' in a Norrathing sense means 'not choosing to worship a god over the others', it is basically impossible to deny or even be unsure of the existence of gods in Norrath, so being agnostic would be the equivalent of 'sitting on the fence' of worhsip. That is, an agnostic character might pray to Tunare when hoping for a good harvest, Rodcet Nife when a family member or friend is sick, or Rallos Zek when his/her people are going to war, etc etc. Personally I think that the vast majority of Norrath would be agnostic (in that sense), but thats just me, prejudiced by my encounters with fantasy and historic religion. Excuse the ramblings. ;o) <br><br>-Mistyn<br>Virtuoso of Luclin ]</i></font><br><br>Rambling is a good thing. :)<br><br>That's as good a definition of agnostic in Norrath as any. The point I wanted to make was that it doesn't (can't) mean the same thing in Norrath that it does for us. And getting hung up on the real life meaning of the word isn't really necessary, and it's not useful to your roleplaying experience. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor,<br>But...what if the world didn't have to change at all? I mean, I believe what the person was intending on doing was EARNING the right to become a bard. By this he wasn't saying throw new guild leaders in each and every single city (I'm not sure if this what you were leaning towards or away from), but instead imagine his DE hunting orcs until 15 so he could at least get into FP to try and prove his worthiness to the guild leader. It's an excellent idea...what if you were to throw a NPC that you could turn your PVP book into (Tomb of Order and Discord) that would grant you the option of becoming an outcast from your city? Think about it...your a High Elf that would love nothing more than to be able to sneak around and steal. You turn your book in to the new NPC and he/she says "You wish to follow your own trail then 'eh? Very well Absor...may Tunare have mercy on your soul...". The NPC kills you, and you respawn outside the city gates. When you try to move near the city guards, their weapons are pointed towards you now...you're an outcast and not wanted here anymore. Get the idea? I'm not quite sure how much coding it would take, or even if it's possible...but I figured it was worth a shot. <br><br>-Tang- ]</i></font><br><br>I understand the idea. And it sounds like a nice one. But it forgets one thing. <br><br>Give people the chance to become a dark elven ranger, and a large portion of the player base will do just that. How much sense would it make if 20% of the dark elven people were rangers? 20% of Norrath's nastiest people are tree-huggers? <br><br>This sort of dovetails into this next comment. It's LONG. I kind of regret my policy of not editing peoples comments&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor: <br><br>I know this is a long post, but I RILLY RILLY hope you'll read it. This is something that's very important to me and something about which I feel very strongly. <br><br>About the subject of removing racial class restrictions, you said: <br><br>"The difference between your idea of no holds barred <br>roleplaying and what I feel is roleplaying are very <br>strong. "<br><br>Oh dear. I can tell I'm not going to like the rest of your post. <br><br>Ruatha reads the rest of your post <br><br>Yep, I was right. I didn't like it. <br>*sigh* <br><br>It's always frustrating to me to try and discuss this topic because it's just so obvious to me how much more fun the game would be if there were less (or no) class restrictions based on race. This isn't to say that I'm right and you're wrong and neener neener neener if you don't like it. Not at all. The rational, reasonable part of my brane tells me "Now now, Ru, not everybody sees the world the way you see the world. And remember: reasonable people with good intentions can still disagree on important issues." And I understand that this is an issue where there really isn't a "wrong" answer. <br><br>But... <br><br>On some level, it's just so blindingly obvious to me -- so fundamentally self evident -- that the game could and would be so much more fun with fewer racial class restrictions (or no racial class restrictions at all), that I have a hard time explaining it. It's like if someone said "Why shouldn't I burn off this dog's tail with a blowtorch?" I wouldn't be able to explain logically and rationally why they shouldn't do it. All I'd be able to do would be to splutter and say "Well, it's just *WRONG* to do that!" <br><br>So there's this other part of my brane -- the old lizard hindbrane bits -- that makes me just wanna grab people who advocate restrictive class options due to "fiction" and shake them briskly and yell "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!? WHY CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MORE *FUN* THE GAME WOULD BE IF I COULD BE AN OGRE BARD OR AN ERUDITE WARRIOR?!?" <br><br>(Actually, since I'm a gnome, I'd probably grab them and just shake myself back and forth briskly while they remained motionless. Ah, the perils of being the proper size while surrounded by all you giants... [biggrin]) <br><br>Having said all of that, I'll try to explain why I feel the way I feel... <br><br>Like many (perhaps most) of the people who play EQ, I have an extensive background in reading Science Fiction and Fantasy books. I grew up reading authors like Asimov and Heinlein. As I got older, I started reading more fantasy and less SF. These days, I'm much more likely to read some cheesy Forgotten Realms book than I am to read Science Fiction. What can I say? I just like the swords and sorcery Fantasy setting. <br><br>But the characters that have always held the most interest for me were those characters that were "different." Characters that didn't adhere to standard Sword-n-Sorcery conventions. I think the first character like this I ever ran across was Elric, from the Moorcock books. <br><br>Elric was the antithesis of the typical sword-n-sorcery hero, particularly of heroes like Conan and Fahfrd. The typical Sword-n-Sorcery hero was big, strong, and physically powerful. They were often uncivilized (both Conan and Fahfrd were barbarians). They had no little (if any) tolerance for the arcane arts. And they were very clearly Good Guys(tm). <br><br>Elric was physically frail, to the point where, before he got Stormbringer, he required drugs to survive. He embraced civilization and longed for its trappings when he was away. He used Sorcery to further his own goals. And he was not always a Good Guy(tm). <br><br>And not only was Elric a departure from scores of fantasy heroes which preceded him, but he was also a rebel among his own kind. He disliked the decadence into which his own race had fallen, and was responsible for leading the sacking of his own hometown. This (among other things) is how he earned the nickname "Kinslayer." <br><br>But Elric was just the first. He's been followed by a string of other characters, heroes and anti-heroes (and occasionally villains) who were interesting because they didn't fit into pre-existing notions of how they should behave. Probably the most well-known of these characters are Drizzt Do'Urden, the Dark Elf Ranger from the R.A. Salvatore books and Dragonbait, the Lizardman Paladin from the "Azure Bonds" books by Jeff Grubb. And there are dozens of others. <br><br>And I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only one who finds these characters much more interesting than their mundane counterparts. Any Human can be a Ranger. But a *Dark Elf*? Why would a Dark Elf be a Ranger? Why isn't he Evil like the rest of his kind? What drove him away from the underground and towards the light? Where did he learn his Ranger skills? The story behind these questions is much more interesting (to me, and to lots of other people) than the story behind why J. Random Human became a Ranger. <br><br>This interest in non-standard, convention-breaking characters has followed me all through my RPG career (spanning over 20 years now). I have always played a non-standard character in all of my RPGs. I was the player who was always pestering the GM to let me bend (or break) the racial class restrictions a tad so I could play something fun and unique. My favorite AD&D character was an Orc Warrior that my GM allowed me to run. <br><br>Even within EverQuest, I have always played non-standard characters. The reason I picked a Gnome Warrior is because they're different. I also have an Ogre Warrior who was raised by Erudites. He wears glasses, and speaks with a cultured, sophisticated accent -- right up until he goes Berzerk, at which point he degenerates into traditional Ogrespeak and starts yelling "THROG SMASH! THROG KILL! GRAAAR!" (He keeps talking like this until the Berzerk wears off, at which point he apologizes to his group and becomes painfully embarassed about his behavior.) I once started a Human Wizard and dumped 15 points into STR and 15 points into STA and claimed that his mother was a Barbarian, and he'd inherited his physical (and mental) traits from his mother's side. But his father had been a Wizard. And his grandfather had been a Wizard. And his great-grandfather had been a Wizard. So he was determined to be a Wizard as well, even though he was much more suited to the life of a Melee class. <br><br>And so on, and so forth, etc. I have always had an interest in playing non-standard characters, because standard characters are...well...standard. And to me, "standard" equals "boring." <br><br>To this, you say: <br><br>"Roleplaying requires a setting. You can't roleplay <br>characters without a universe for them to exist in. <br>Characters, therefore, should be a logical outcome of <br>living in that world (and of course that world needs <br>to make sense). Iksar paladins don't fit into the world <br>of Norrath. Iksar have been isolated for a very long <br>time. They have only one god, and he certainly doesn't <br>support the idea of paladins. That is a function of the <br>nature of iksar, as they exist on Norrath. It's part of <br>the world. Creating a character that is explicitly <br>contrary to that world isn't roleplaying. "<br><br>Allow me to point out two things. <br><br>1) Verant defines the fiction. If Verant had created the Iksar race and said "There is a heretical sect of good-aligned Iksars hidden within a secret camp in the Field of Bone. Iksars who follow this sect can be Paladins." then *voila*, that's the fiction. That's what they did with Erudites. Erudites are noble and good -- except for those Heretics in Paineel. So you can't really justify your argument with "Well, that's not fiction." You work for the company that creates the fiction, and they can define any fiction they choose if it suits their needs. <br><br>2) Having said that, yes, I agree that setting is important. And, for better or for worse, Verant has set the initial fiction in stone. Iksars can't start off as Paladins. Ogres can't start off as Bards. Erudites can't start off as Warriors. And I agree that it would be kinda silly to have completely unrestricted race/class combinations at character creation. I mean, I just can't see an Ogre Paladin guild in Oggok. <br><br>But. <br><br>People (and Iksars, and Ogres, and Erudites) can change, if they want. Who's to say that an Ogre Warrior, travelling outside of Oggok for the first time, might not run across a bard in the Feerrott, and be entranced by the songs of the bard, to the point where he becomes determined to be a bard himself? Who's to say that an Erudite, after visiting Qeynos for the first time, becomes filled with visions of martial glory after visiting the Grounds of Fate, and becomes determined to be a Warrior? <br><br>So for me, I'm not irked by the fact that my beginning class selection is racially restricted. But I do think there should be a way to change to a different class via a quest. <br><br>Before you start shaking your head and saying "No no no, out of the question," hear me out. I have what I think is a perfectly workable (in the sense of "won't unbalance the game and won't break fiction") idea to allow in-game class changes. <br><br>1) For every class in the game, create at least one avenue where anyone of any race/class/deity combo raise faction with a guild of that class. It doesn't necessarily have to be an exciting or easy way to raise faction. Maybe it's tedious and boring. And make it so where it doesn't raise faction with anybody else but the guild in question. <br><br>2) Create an NPC that gives out a "change of class" quest for that guild. The quest should be challenging on the order of the Crafted Armor quests. <br><br>2a) Make it so where you can't switch classes if your race could have been that class from the beginning. So if you're a human, you can't switch to any class but Shaman (since humans can be every other class). <br><br>3) Require the player character to be at least 20th level and have "Ally" level faction before the NPC gives out the "change of class" quest. <br><br>4) Once the character completes the quest, the character undergoes a ceremony which transforms him/her into a 1st level character of the desired class -- with the same stats as a 1st level character of the desired class. All those weapon skills you've been raising for 20 levels? Reset to zero. All those other skills you've been learning for 20 levels, like Bind Wound and Baking? Reset to zero. All those hit points you had as a 20th level character? Gone. You're a 1st Level character with the same HP as any 1st level character would have based on your class and STA. You may have been a 20th level Ogre SK with 1000 hp before, but now you're a 1st level Ogre Enchanter with 30 HP. All the equipment you had on you? Gone. You're now the proud owner of 5 biscuits, 5 flasks of milk, and the standard Newbie weapon for your class. (Sure, this could be bypassed with the help of a friend. But then it's just like twinking, and that's pretty common in the game. So you're not really making the situation worse.) <br><br>4a) The character's deity is also changed if the new class is incompatible with the character's original deity. The new class/deity combination will not improve faction with anyone. Everybody who disliked you before still dislikes you. But faction can get worse, depending on the nature of the deity change. <br><br>5) This is a one-time only quest. Once you've changed your class, you can't change it back, or change to another class. (Word gets around that you've changed your class once, and other guild leaders will refuse to accept you on the assumption that you're a dilettante.) <br><br>So, to illustrate an example: <br><br>Throckmorton the Troll wants to be a Ranger. To become a Ranger, Throckmorton has to first find a way to increase faction with one of the Ranger guilds in the game (Kithicor Rangers, Protectors of the Pine, or Champions of Faydark) until he is considered an "Ally" of this guild. Note that being an Ally with one of these guilds doesn't necessarily convey the automatic ability to wander nonchalantly up to the guild trainers. For example, if Throckmorton raises his Protectors of the Pine faction without raising his JaggedPine Treefolk faction, then his trip to see Hager Sureshot in Surefall Glade will end the minute he runs across one of the druids in Surefall. <br><br>Once he has found a way to increase faction to Ally, and found a way to approach the "change-of-class" quest NPC without getting killed, he then has to wait until he's 20th level before he can even do the quest. Once he hits 20th level, he's given a quest along the lines of "Go get a common drop from a rare MOB and bring it back." Once he completes this quest, he is transformed into a 1st level character of the new class. He has the original STR, STA, DEX, etc stats that he started with initially, but all his combat skills are reset to zero and his HP is calculated based on his new class and current Level and STA. So before the change, he was a 20th level Warrior with several hundred HP. Now he's a 1st level Ranger with 30 HP. <br><br>Since he can't be a Ranger and worship Cazic-Thule, he also had to switch deities. So he picked Karana. Alas, the only people who've heard about his conversion are the people in Neriak, Grobb, and Oggok. So anybody he was KOS to before, he's still KOS to now. Plus he's now KOS in places he used to not be KOS in. <br><br>The reason I think this will work is because: <br><br>1) It won't be a cakewalk. Being allied with the Bard Guild in Qeynos doesn't mean a thing if you're KOS to the Qeynos Guards and the Qeynos Merchants. So if you're an Ogre who wants to be a Bard, you'll either have to find some way to sneak in to the Bard Guild without being seen by any of the merchants or guards, or you'll have to raise faction with the Qeynos Guards and Merchants as well. <br><br>2) It's not easy to abuse. Requiring that someone be Allied faction *and* 20th level before even being given the *quest* to change class will keep a lot of folks from doing it, because they won't want to go through all the tedium of raising faction for 20 levels, only to get to start all over at level 1 and go back through the first 20 levels again. <br><br>3) It's not unbalancing. Your faction won't be any better after the class change than it was before. However, it might very well be worse. And being an weak Erudite Warrior or a dumb Troll Enchanter will confer its own challenges. <br><br>4) It's consistent with existing fiction. Yes, in the world of Norrath, most Ogres are mindless brutes who eat dwarves and beat each other with swords just for funsies. So no Ogre can *start* as a Bard. That's just not part of the Ogre culture on Norrath. But if an Ogre goes adventuring, meets a Bard, and decides that he RILLY RILLY RILLY wants to *be* a Bard, he can, if he's willing to pay his dues. <br><br>5) It encourages creativity and roleplaying. People will be encouraged to come up with reasons for why their Gnome is a Shadow Knight, or that their Ogre is an Enchanter, and this is a good thing. And, for the most part, I think that the majority of the people who would even bother doing this will be those people who are inclined towards roleplaying anyways. <br><br>Now, obviously, this may not necessarily be an easy coding job. But from a gameplay, game balance, and game fiction standpoint, I think it makes a whole lot of sense. I can't think of any negatives that would occur from a system like this. <br><br>Wow. Like I said, this was a long post. I hope you read it, and I hope it makes sense. I cannot express how much I would [b]***LOVE*** to play on a server that had a mechanism like I describe for changing classes. I play on Brell. I've been playing on Brell since August 1999. I love my guild, and I love my guildmates. And I would leave them all in a heartbeat to play on a server that would allow me to be an Ogre Bard or an Erudite Warrior. (Actually, I wouldn't really be leaving them. I know 'em well enough that they'd be racing me to the new server so they could play a neat new character.) So I'm asking you to please please PLEASE look this over and don't reject it out of hand just because you don't personally agree with it. Even if this isn't something you would want to implement on all the servers, I think it's something you could easily implement one one server. So those of us who wanted to be unique characters could do so, while those of you who think it "breaks fiction" wouldn't have to play on that server and wouldn't have to be confronted with High Elf Monks and Dwarf Magicians. <br><br>Thanks a lot for your time! <br><br>Ruatha Kneeslasher<br>48th Level Gnome Warriorette <br>Skyfire is what Lavastorm wants to be when it grows up... ]</i></font><br><br>My response to you is the same that it was to the last person. In a world with no restrictions, you can't be an iconoclast. <br><br>I love to play the outcast. I love having some sort of stigma attached to my characters. In a recent D&D campaign we were to play members of a once-great society that had fallen to a plague. They now find themselves surrounded by wild lands. Into those wild lands they toss their criminals, and those criminals are often bitter.<br> <br>When handed the character creation information, I read that we could play outcasts if we chose to. The risks would be incredible (poorly treated by the bulk of the civilized people of the world, poorly treated by your own folk, no chance of resurrection in a world where raising the dead is not uncommon and many more). The GM stressed this several times in the written material and in person. I know my fellow players, we've been playing together for years. I knew that at most three of us would choose to be outcasts. It turns out only two of us did (the other went to the other extreme, hating outcasts to with a passion). <br><br>I wouldn't have chosen to be an outcast if it wouldn't have been a hard character to play, and I certainly wouldn't have done it if I thought that the majority of the group would have done it. <br><br>But that's a small group, and a group that knows that when our GM says "playing an outcast is going to be HARD", he means it. <br><br>When you're talking about thousands of players, a large number of which are fans of the same fantasy authors that we're all fans of, you'll find that a large number of players will want to play the outcast. They either won't believe that it will be hard to do, or they'll expect things to be made easier if they complain enough. <br><br>That's why I love the new rules for Sullon Zek. You can play the iconoclast, the outsider, and there are real in-game consequences for that choice. <br><br>Without those consequences (making it hard to accomplish won't be a consequence, once you've done that, then things will be smooth sailing) you're unique Drizzt will be one of many Drizzts, and he won't be nearly as much fun. And he certainly won't be the unique character that he is in the world of his creator. In a novel the character can remain unique. Make him an option in a massively multiplayer game and he will become too common. <br><br>That's my opinion, anyhow. <br><br>Runti wrote: <br><br>Absor, <br><br>I have to agree with your recent comments about the players needing to fit into the world of Norath. For most roleplayers, the most fun comes from playing a character who is different from the norm. Thus the desire for dark elf bards and iksar paladins. The problem is that most roleplayers are used to worlds with 4 to 8 PCs and millions of NPCs. Norath has more PCs than player race NPCs.

It was a quiet day on the Developer's Corner.  The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000216.html">big update</a> from Mr. Poe by way of Alan:<UL>Lawrence sent me this update to pass on to all of you. <br><br>----------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Hey guys, as I get ready to head out for the Fan Faire I wanted to sit down and write up this post I've been putting off all week. A couple quick notes. <br><br>The "problem" with rain spell pulses always being resisted if they will be the killing blow isn't actually a problem....It's an intentional design feature. The problem was much like the old DOT corpse poof buf. If the Rain killed the NPC and the server was unsure where the damage came from the corpse would poof, so these spells were coded in this manner to prevent that from happening. I'm working with the coders to come up with a better solution. We're all pretty busy right now so unfortunately I can't give you a time frame on when a better solution will be implemented. <br><br>Kunark Evac spells: these will now work anywhere in the world. You won't have to be in a Kunark dungeon to use them. This change will apply to both Wizards and Druids evac spells. <br><br>Druid Spell Egress: this spell will now work indoors. It didn't make sense for the group version to work indoors (a mistake on our part) and not have the self version work indoors. <br><br>Shroud of Death: I added Illusion Skeleton to shroud of death on test server..... I removed it the next day I just didn't get to update spells on test. I forgot that in skeleton form trolls and ogres would lose slam, sorry for the scare. I'll see if I can think up some other way to give SKs skeleton form. <br><br>Stacking issues: I continue to address these as time permits. We're working on some changes that will allow me to fix them much easier. More stacking issues should be resolved in the coming months. High level players should be pleased to know that I'm 99.99999% certain that Call of Earth and Speed of the Shissar will no longer conflict after the next patch. <br><br>New Translocates: as many of you know there are new translocate spells up on test. I'm not going to comment on these other than to say you can expect that cool cat Al'Kabor to be out and about researching again. <br><br>Now on to the "Burning issue". I know the Wizard community has been *patiently* awaiting the enhancement we have been working on The coding for the new spell effect has been finished and it is going through extensive internal testing. It has also been on Test Server for a week, but I doubt you would have seen it in a parser &#8211; cause I'm sneaky like that. Before I go into details on the new spells there's a few things I'd like to say. Honestly I feel that wizards are balanced fine from a power standpoint, to that end you will not be receiving an upgrade to your damage output. Where I do feel wizards need help is group utility. <br><br>As I'm sure you can understand coming up with a highly desirable utility type spell for an EverQuest wizard is not an easy task. I've spent countless hours pondering a solution, I've read countless message board forums and emails looking at suggestions from you guys. Finally a solution was found! I'm not naive enough to believe that everyone will be happy about the new enhancement but this is an idea I've seen tossed around on a number of forums and I think not only does it fit in well with wizards being the masters of arcane transportation, I think it will make them very desirable in the 50 to 60 levels where they seem to be struggling for usefulness. <br><br>The new spells will give wizards the ability to prevent NPCs from gating. There will be 3 versions of the spells starting at level 51. They will each have a different resistance type. One of the problems with duration based effects is stacking and negating the need for multiple characters of the same class. I am designing these spells with that in mind. If you want to 100% ensure an NPC does not gate you will need more than one wizard. I understand this may upset some people but the need for multiple wizards to "Anchor" an NPC won't really happen until you fight the more epic mobs with higher hit point numbers. For single group encounters one wizard with these spells should, in most situations, be enough to get the job done. My plan is to get these spells implemented and ready to go before the next patch. <br><br>Lastly I would like to send a huge thank you to all the players who have reported stacking exploits to me through Email, IRC, and ICQ over the past couple of months. The feedback is greatly appreciated. <br><br>Take care all!<br>/Lakers secret handshake<br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>----------------------------------------<br>:)<br><br>Alan</UL>

A search for a missing Paladin has begun.  Here's the word from Aragir Lancot:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings all.I was once a member of Ring of Truth, on Xegony server. Jareth Wolfeshadow was the guildleader at the time,a paladin of 30 some levels. Before I left the guild he and I had become fast friends. We had even discussedthe possibility of his coming to visit me and my wife IRL. He changed his surname to D'Lere in the months afterI left Ring of Truth, and levelled up to about 40 some odd by January.<br><br>Jareth was an upstanding paladin; truth, honor, and valor were qualities that described him above many others.In February I met with him and he bestowed upon me his Ghoulbane, which I wield to this day.On Saturday, June 9, I heard from a friend, who'd heard from a friend that claimed to have heard from Jareth'splayers RL brother, that Jareth had perished in a car accident. However, I have spoke to the friend, and to thisfriend's friend, and the details are sketchy. I am, if not unconvinced, unsatisfied with the information I've recievedso far.<br><br>Anyone who may have known the player behind Jareth D'lere, please contact me at <a href="mailto:hbooraem@excite.com">hbooraem@excite.com</a> withwhatever contact information you can offer me. I know several details about the players life, such that I amconfident I can screen the uninformed from those who actually have genuine information.Thank you for your help. If Jareth D'Lere has truly passed away, Norrath has suffered the loss of a true paladin,and the world has lost a good man.

EverQuest Character Status (EQCS) is a first of its kind in EverQuest development.

Players can use this to list the following items on the listing server<uL><LI>Online/Offline Status <br><LI>Current Zone <br><LI>Level, Class, Race <br><LI>Location <br><LI>Closest Landmark** <br><LI>User Biography* <br><LI>Favorite Zone* <br><LI>Other Characters* <br><LI>Pet Name <br><LI>ICQ, AIM, MSN, Yahoo! and/or Email address*<br>* - You enter this information in the program<br>** - Only Gfay landmarks for now... all other zones comming in later versions.</UL><br>All this information is pulled from the text in your log file, except choices marked with a single asterisk.  Users can pick and choose which items they wish to display and which items they do not wish to display, so you still may post your status and remain anonymous if you wish.<br> <br>Some may think this will cause lag since it is pasring the log file intermitantly, however, the way I designed it, it makes no lag at all (I even tested it on a machine running a Pentium II 300Mhz with 96Mb ram on a 56K and it ran fine while in EQ).  When parsing, it will parse ONLY new lines in your log file, so it doesnt create any lag.<br> <br>Okay, so you have to have the log option on for this to pull the information, what if you dont want to have a log file building up? There is an option included to erase already parsed information.<br> <br>Also, be sure to keep an eye out for the release of the listing server.  In later versions I will allow other websites to run a listing server of their own.

Alan dropped by the Developer's Corner this afternoon and made a variety of updates.  Here they are for your reading pleasure:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000199.html"><b>nVidia Drivers</b></a><br>CloudKraken wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Actually, on the Win2k driver inf file, the registry setting for TNT is there, but the TNT's Enumeration ID isn't there. <br><br>Result is Windows cannot find any matching Enum ID for TNT in the inf file and think the driver kit does not contain any files for TNT. <br><br>So unless you edit the .inf yourself and void the WHQC stamp, you can't really install the driver through standard methods. <br><br>So the 54 year-old man was right, at least on the Win2k system.]</i></font> <br><br>Fair enough. <br><br>This isn't our driver, so I can't fix this. :)<br><br>I guess I'll have to say, use it at your own risk, we can't make it work. But it's certainly something we'd suggest you use, if you can get it to work.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000195.html"><b>More Feedback!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've made a few posts about the possible future of all the Iksar class quests and if they will be brought to ;ogical completion, but have never recieved any kind of response. I thought this would fall under the category of new topics, but i guess not. If this subject has already been addressed I was wondering if you could repost your comments about it. I haven't been able to find any info on the matter. <br><br>Sorulrna Ironscale of Castersrealm<br>46th lvl monk of Karana ]</i></font><br><br>All of the Iksar quests are technically finished. All the ones that exist can be completed. Only the Greenmist quest even implies that there is a chance that the quest might be extended. <br><br>That being said, there are plans to extend some of these quests at some time in the future. I don't know when that will be. <br><br>Dedaelos wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The trumpet fanfare you hear when completing a quest was also used in an older rpg called Daggerfall. You would hear the same sound when you did certain things like gaining levels, if I remember correctly. ]</i></font><br><br>Sound travels&#8230; <br><br>:)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: That trumpet thingy is more like the first few tones from the title screen of the second BlackAdder series ... <br><br>At first I was stupified why I kept hearing that in my head while playing Everquest, until I finished a quest once with that tune playing in my head ... then one and one connected. <br><br>Heh, so now whenever I finish a quest, I automatically hum that tune a little while. Kinda weird how BlackAdder and Everquest connect, eh? Well, I've seen things more weird :)<br><br>- Kaysha Soulsinger<br>Cleric of the 47th Circle of Erollisi Marr ]</i></font><br><br>Very far indeed&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just one little thing I have given some thought to in the past. In a way its modeled after the change that came to the xp bar. The smaller line down the middle of the xp bar that represented the percentage of a yellow bubble. <br><br>I have wondered for some time if it would be possible to do something similar on the group list. However in this case the line drawn down the middle of each players health status bar would represent how much mana that person currently has. Now I know this would add to the amount of information be sent out to the clients, but I always thought it would be an interesting addition. <br><br>cheers, <br><br>Keyen of the Crimson Hawks. ]</i></font><br><br>We don't have any plans to implement something like that. There really is no way that your character would know that status of your friends' magical energy. You can look at them and get an idea as to how wounded they are, but knowing their mana isn't something that we see as part of the game. I know there have been a lot of requests for this feature and others this it (one that asked for a %M that would report your percentage mana for macros). But we just don't see that as part of the game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Is verant an equal oportunity employer? I know you have a gnoll (FIPPP!) a halfling (Mennix) and atleast atleast 2 dorfs (Lead GM's Axegoreth and Valtron) but does verant employee any half elves? <br><br>I'm starting to wonder if my people are being discriminated against! <br><br>We are without a doubt the cutest race. <br><br>Galidin the Noble Heart<br>Half Elf Crusader ]</i></font><br><br>Perhaps the cutest race indeed. But as is evidenced by my employment here, cute isn't a consideration&#8230; <br><br>:)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000019.html"><b>Roleplaying or Just Playing?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As an alternative to removing Common or making Dark Speech act as "Dark Common," why not simply make Common a language that players have to learn? It makes sense that someone raised in Kaladim might have heard some Common, but it's unlikely that they actually learned the language until they had a reason to go out into the world. <br><br>This makes sense in the context of a trade tongue. Even though you might deal with dwarven merchants on a regular basis, if you're dwarven the odds are slim that you bothered to learn a new language when your native one works just fine. <br><br>Alternatively, you could default common to start at only 1-2 points, perhaps representing the few bits of the language picked up by observing the local dwarven merchant purchasing leather gloves from the human ranger . . . <br><br>--Ixsamael ]</i></font><br><br>That's another possibility. We haven't really talked about how hard we want to make it to communicate on a roleplaying server. Making it hard to speak with folks outside your race serves to insulate the racial community, making them tighter knit and making it less likely (because it's harder) that someone will break down the racial stereotypes. <br><br>But it also makes the game harder to play, especially if taken too far. It could be argued that removing /tell is the right thing to do on a roleplaying server, simply because it isn't something that your character should be able to do. But it is also an extremely useful tool for the player. <br><br>And that gave me an idea&#8230; what about only allowing /tell to work for a character over X level? We might be willing to accept that all Norrathians have some ability to communicate mentally as they grow more powerful (guards can tell your religion, after all&#8230;). And this would insulate the lower level communities, making it more likely that young trolls will hang out with other young trolls, and young halflings will hang out with other young halflings, if used in combination with the removal of a common language.<br> <br>But is that too restrictive to fun gameplay? I don't know. We'll hash this out internally some time in the future. But we're not really looking at implementing a roleplaying server right away. We want to keep focused on the new PvP thing for a while, until we're satisfied with it. So keep hold of your ideas. I'll be asking for them later. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I know this involves programming, but what the heck. As long we're brainstorming about Common and emotes, why not simply have a "language check" for emotes? When a character performs an emote, either one of the defaults or by typing, the emote is flagged with that language. When someone sees the emote, it must be deciphered just like any other language text. <br><br>I would really hate to see emotes removed from a Roleplaying server -- it seems like it would defeat the whole purpose. On that server I would hope to see more use of emotes rather than less. A language check could easily be justified as an understanding of the culture and I think would add to the fun of playing on the server. <br><br>Oh, and by the way, I really think this would have to work for all emotes because I rarely use the built-in ones. I'm a good typist and can easily throw in a quick sentence about my character's behavior that fits the situation. A new feature that I would like to see is the separation of the physical actions from the text. Take /wave for instance. There are times when I'd like to do something like the following: <br><br>/em looks at %T impatiently.<br>/wave <br><br>In other words, I'd like to have the waving animation without the "Arshal waves at soandso" message. Maybe you could modify the command so that if additional text is provided it is used instead of the default. Eg: <br><br>/wave looks at %T impatiently. <br><br>Whadayathink? <br><br>Arshal ]</i></font><br><br>That's most certainly a way to go. Maybe even restrict emotes to the character's native tongue (which might be easier to program). <br><br>I can see the value of your suggestion about text attached to emotes. I'll pass that on. As you can imagine it isn't the sort of thing that we're going to drop other things to look into, but it's certainly worth taking a look at. <br><br>Mechromancer wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well,for me (and I know I am in the minority here) I don't enjoy roleplaying in any game where the game mechanics themselves don't provide incentive for roleplaying(such as the "advantages" and "Disadvantages" of such "generic" systems as HERO and GURPS).I cannot help this.I have been a "systems freak" since I discovered "RuneQuest" and other great p&p RPG's and stopped playing simpler games like "(A)D&D".I would have no problem with roleplaying in EQ if I could choose a "disadvantage" like "Hates gnomes"(any gnomes conning me would get the "Scowls at you..." message ...that would be cool) or "weakness for beautiful women"(you can imagine a troll with this disad' having a small chance of becoming "charmed" or "mezzed" when within agro radius of a non-hostile high charisma elf maiden...that would be hilarious!).]</i></font> <br><br>I'm the other way around. Systems like Gurps and Hero System that encourage players to make up really bizarre character traits just to get points tend to bother me (love those systems, just not keen on that one part). And I think that RuneQuest rocks because it is a simpler system than D&D (though 3rd edition goes a long way toward removing the needless complications of that system). The RuneQuest world is exceedingly complex and detailed, but the game system itself is one of the simplest I've ever seen. <br><br>The reason that I'm not a big fan of the idea of rewarding personality quirks with points is that, well, you should be adding those quirks to your character anyway. If your character hates Gnomes, then he hates Gnomes. Getting points for it doesn't make that quirk more valid. It's more the opposite, really. You tend to see far more completely ridiculous quirks in a system that rewards the player with points for them. <br><br>My old gaming group (/em Absor lapses into his old EQX editorial style) is restarting our 'planar' campaign. The idea was to allow us to make the wildest characters possible. We would make up the world they came from, with as much detail as we wanted. We'd also be building characters with the express intent of making them as powerful as we can, because the game campaign is going to be really hard. Then the characters would be yanked to Sigil (the D&D 'center of the universe' setting). <br><br>Well, in mild mockery of this idea, I created a superhero character. Once able to fly, call the lightning and rip cars in half, he had been reduced to mortal status by the trickery of an old flame. He was glad to escape his old world for the new one, where he studies magic. <br><br>But I gave him a few quirks, as much to make fun of the whole idea as to get him points. His spells don't affect things that are the color yellow. This makes a lot of things resistant to his spells, and someone could easily kill him with a #2 pencil if they dressed themselves in a banana suit&#8230; <br><br>But I digress. I've seen Hero system characters with some of the stupidest flaws attached to them, just because they needed a few more points. <br><br>You can have quirks in EverQuest. And they are all the more meaningful because everyone knows that they are part of your character's personality, not some desire to have a few more points added to the power of your energy blast. <br><br>In fact my character on Sullon, at least until he's wiped, is learning to really, really hate necromancers&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: What I've always found funny is that standard Troll and Ogre roleplaying sound svery much like the typical parody of Canadian Prime Ministeer Jean Chrtien. <br><br>Chrtien's grasp of English isn't as strong as you might expect of a Canadian, and it wouldn't be out of place to hear him say "meez gonna eats yoos." <br><br>Very funny. I'm sure other Canadians agree. <br><br>Aethelgrin<br>DE Warrior &#8211; Karana ]</i></font><br><br>Don't get mad at me, Canada.

After a short delay due to last weekend's server problems, a new editorial has been published at Shadoe's Corner.  <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid992486237,50295,">Questing for EQ Comedy</a> explores the world of EQ humor sites as well as briefly touching on the Conquest guild controversy.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Is it me, or does it seem like EverQuest-related comic strips have lost their focus lately? Not so much a deviation from the focus on the game itself, or any tongue-in-cheek derision on what life is like for the average EQ player, but rather on compromising basic humor for the sake of political commentary. For ages, it's been part of my morning ritual at the office to kick off the day with such levity as delivered by /GU... by Woody Hearn, Ding! by Scott Kurtz, and the late (but not forgotten) EverCrest by Tim Fries. They've been a staple in the drudgery of my workaday lifestyle, keeping me sane in my 8x8 cubicle by offering the occasional guffaw at the game's expense. </UL>You can respond to Shadoe's latest editorial by posting to the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=12609321&replies=0">Feedback Board Thread</a>.

Here's the latest load of posts written by Alan VanCouvering on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Deity Server</b></a><br>Rubikoob wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First off, let me say I very much like the idea of the Deity-based team PvP server, and personally plan on having my 1 character there. I hope the testing goes well. <br><br>However, I have some doubts regarding the balancing of the teams. From the charts I've seen (thanks to EQLizer), the good team has 34 race/class combinations compared to 48 for the neutrals and 45 for the evils. There are 2 races which cannot be evil (Dwarves and High Elves), 3 races which cannot be neutral (Trolls, Ogres, Iksar), and 7 (!) races which cannot be good (All the short races, the pure-evils, and the Dark Elves). The good team has no one able to cast Summon Corpse (I realize, however, that it has already been said that a method will be given them), and no race which is pure-good. While it is a valid point that having a race which is purely one alignment is as much a detriment as a benefit, I believe each of the teams ought to have at least one such race, representing a sort of core or foundation. <br><br>In my opinion, this set up looks pretty well stacked against the good-aligned team. I suspect that the new, upcoming Vah Shir race may be the answer. This is probably even the intended place for that race... but I'd like to hear a comment directly from someone at Verant to confirm/deny/poke fun at this... prediction? If the Vah Shir show up, pure-good, with an average number of classes to choose from, it will bring the good team right about into balance with the others. <br><br>Thanks for your time. The work you do here on the board is very much appreciated. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, as I've said, it is entirely possible that Evil will be strongest on this server. But not so much for the reasons you've stated. <br><br>The number of race class combinations really doesn't matter. People will decide their team before they choose a race or class. The fact that there are more combinations for one or the other probably won't influence this decision. The only time it will matter is for those that prefer a class over all others. Those that want to be monks, for example, won't be able to be evil. But if they want to play a cleric, they can be on any team. The trick is that most of the classes are available to all teams. <br><br>It is, however, a much bigger issue that the evil team has more security, more unity. They will rule three cities completely, and one more almost completely. That will have a large bearing on their success as a team. <br><br>But, really, it will come down to how many players on a server will want to play on each team. If the majority of people want to play good, then good will have an advantage, regardless of the situation. <br><br>Some of the solutions that I've seen, like moving Rallos to the neutral team, or Karana to the good, won't work. That sort of change would really mess up the class availability. Making Karana good would mean there are no neutral rangers or druids, and that seems wrong on a lot of levels. Making Rallos neutral would fragment the evil teams, leaving them worse off than any other team (as opposed to better off like they are now), and it would mean no evil bards, so no tracking&#8230; <br><br>I'm real convinced that the current organization is the best available, even though it wasn't my design. :)<br><br>Sslith <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Will guilds created on Sullon during the test phase transfer over when the server goes live? ]</i></font><br><br>Nope. Sorry, it's a full wipe. <br><br>Mancubus-VZ wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well I hit the wrong button in the process of writing the last message so lets try again. Im just hoping to get a response or some notification that this bug is in fact a bug and is being looked into. When a bard has targeted a threatening PC opponent, usually for combat, the use of any group only beneficial spells cannot be used and the message, this Spell cannot effect this PC, comes up. I would assume this is a simple error, and requires a little coding, but any song a bard sings is not beneficial to your enemy. If I were to cast Selos on my group that is not beneficial to the enemy, in fact its the complete opposite. Not only is the song not affecting him directly, but now my entire group is running faster than the enemy making this spell an attack spell in essense. The only way to get beneficial group only songs to play is to tab target yourself and then tab target back to your opponent. This additional step takes a second or two and makes me as the bard lose track of what I was doing because my hands have to shift position in order to successfully attempt this maneuver. Any information or planning of fixing this bug would be greatly appreciated, mainly because bards are awesome PvPers, are fun to play, and it makes me sad to say this, but unless this bug is fixed the decision to play a bard on Live is about zero percent. ]</i></font><br><br>Looks like a bug. The team is aware of it, and we'll get it fixed before the server goes live. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You mentioned that you guys are leaning away from getting rid of the common tongue, such that everyone will be able to speak with everyone else. Are you sticking to that decision? Could you ask us players if we have a preference? :)  I mean, if the premise here is "hardcore roleplaying", inserting a language barrier seems like a logical step. If racial prejudices are going to become an important aspect of the server, it'd seem like a nice way to stir up conflicts a little by adding the confusion of an inability to comunicate. <br><br>And past that, it'd give people a reason to use the languages system that's already in the game. While I forsee that in the distant future everyone will have learned every spoken language just to avoid frustration (unless you could maybe limit the languages a person knows going by their intelligence score?), it'd at least make diplomacy something that requires a conscious effort. <br><br>-Ereet ]</i></font><br><br>We don't plan to make any language changes for this server. Any such changes will be a part of the consideration for a 'roleplaying' server at some (hopefully near) future time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Please take the time to read and listen to my concerns over the possible destruction of my guild. <br><br>That sounds ominous, I know, but that's exactly how much it frightened me to hear that there's the possibility of hardcoded teams on Vallon Zek. My concern stems from the fact that a "maybe" comment was given when you were asked if any of the rules from Sullon Zek would migrate to the Teams servers. Yes, I am aware that the Teams servers were set up to allow a four way war among the race teams. However, as far as I'm aware, it has never been mandated that we MUST wage a four way war among the race teams. Having the option to PvP with the other teams is great, but what of alliances? What of treaties and teaming up against the common foe? What of Roleplaying Good against Evil, Light against Dark? Hardcoding the teams on Vallon Zek would disallow such things. Yes, I know that there are players who are begging for exactly that, but now that they have Sullon Zek, I'm hoping that Vallon and Tallon Zek will be left as is, or at the very least, that one will be left as is, with a movelog enabled to allow a choice. <br><br>You see, my guild is a "Lighty" guild. It's composed of members from the three "Light" (ie non-Dark) races, with the exception of SK's and Necro's. That's right, we willingly accept the handicap of not having SK's and Necro's, to Roleplay a guild of Light Races that battles Dark Races exclusively, in a war of Good vs Evil. We also enjoy PvE, operating as a team of guildmates supporting each other. Disallowing benificial buffs and heals to be cast across the race teams would ruin our ability to function as a guild in PvE AND PvP. In short, hardcoding the teams would destroy our guild. Destroy our guild, and it would destroy our desire to play. <br><br>My plea is this: Please allow at least ONE (if not both) of the Teams servers to remain as is, with regards to PvP rules. If any of the Sullon Zek rules (hardcoded teams, XP loss for PvP, etc) are migrated to a Teams server, then please only do this to one of them, and allow the other to stay the same, with a movelog to allow us the choice of how to play. We "Light vs. Dark" players enjoy the game, and want to continue to enjoy the game, but we can't play the game on non-PvP servers (because we can't fight the Dark races), and we can't play it on Sullon Zek (because we can't be a unified guild of Light races), so the only place we CAN play the game we love so much, is on Vallon and Tallon Zek. <br><br>I understand the desire of those who want to play the game of PvP with hardcoded teams. I'm glad that they have such a place now, on Sullon Zek. I would even understand it if ONE of the existing PvP Teams servers were changed to have hardcoded race teams, to suit the purists. However, please understand OUR (my guild and those like us) desire to play without hardcoded teams so that we can play "Light vs. Dark"/"Good vs. Evil" as well. We have such a place on Vallon and Tallon Zek, and we hope that it doesn't go away. <br><br>Again, there is a rich and thriving community already in place on Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek. Guilds with history and reputations (both good and bad). While some choose to play racial purists (which is currently supported by the rules) others choose to band together members of two, three, or even all four races to fight a common foe (which is ALSO currently supported by the rules). Disallowing cross-team buffs and heals in the future would destroy the existing community, wipe out many of the established guilds, and cause many, myself included, to simply quit playing because we would have lost our main source of enjoyment: our family. <br><br>Light vs. Dark players love EQ, too, Absor. Please keep at least one server available for us. <br><br>Thank you for reading, Absor, I do appreciate the work you do. Please communicate my fears and concerns to the appropriate people. I hope my fears are put to rest, for I do love playing EQ, but could not continue to play if my family (my guild) were destroyed. <br><br>Feel free to e-mail me privately if you don't want to post this on the Developer's Corner, although you may certainly do so if you wish. <br><br>Again, thanks. <br><br>Taliaferro Erucolindo<br>Officer of Giliath Lang<br>Vallon Zek<br>"My team? My team is Giliath Lang!" ]</i></font><br><br>I can't tell you what will happen about this, I don't know for certain yet. <br><br>But as far as I can tell, 'cross-teaming' was never intended on the team servers. It should be pretty obvious that the intent was that there be four teams, not two. And I fully expect (though, as I said, I'm not certain yet) that the teams will be locked down in the near future. <br><br>How that happens, whether it's both servers or just one (or neither&#8230;), I don't know. <br><br>This certainly does not mean that we think that there isn't some viability to a good vs. evil team server. It's obvious that there is. <br><br>And, frankly, in my opinion there are far too many 'abuses' available to people that cross team. Obviously I am not implying that you or your guild are the type of people to use such abuses, I wouldn't know. But the entire idea that it is possible to create immune healers and such by the existing system is something that bothers me a lot. <br><br>Unfortunately, you'll have to wait a while for a final decision about the existing PvP servers as far as rule changes and such go. <br><br>Well, there have been nearly 500 comments since I opened this thread. Even those that haven't like certain of the decisions that we've made, have been enthusiastic about the idea in general. I'm very encouraged. Thanks for all the feedback.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000204.html"><b>More Pet Questions</b></a><br>-Tamria- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Whilst I'm not particularly bothered about pets poofing when I invis or ITU as I've gotten used to it. I think you insult the majority of pet class players by implying that a smart player shouldn't find it a problem. <br><br>There are many times I will be in a dungeon or somewhere and need to invis (whether to check out a spawn, go guide a friend in, go drag someone's corpse etc) but also want to keep my pet for saftey and convenience. Necro pets take a LONG time to cast so trying to remake a pet in a hostile area just because you had to invis to go drag a friend's corpse will tend to get you killed. <br><br>It's nothing to do with how smart players are it's to do with convenience. Like I said it's not a big deal to me, I got used to it many levels ago - just don't offend me by claiming it's not an issue for smart players. ]</i></font><br><br>Oh, now come on. I never said that any pet player was not smart for having to deal with these issues. What I said was that how you deal with them will determine if you are a good pet caster or a not so good one. It has nothing to do with being smart. I think of myself as smart, but I'm also not good at accounting. I have trouble learning new languages. But that doesn't mean I'm stupid. <br><br>The decisions that you make when playing your pet class has everything to do with how well you do with that character. It is indeed a problem for anyone playing such a class that they need to decide on the trade-offs all the time, no matter how smart they are.<br> <br>Don't try to make it sound like I'm calling anyone stupid because they have to decide which pet to summon for which location, or whether or not to try to keep their pet with them while looking for a corpse. The obstacles themselves (which is what I was talking about) have nothing to do with the abilities that people bring to bear for getting past them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm glad the owner doesnt panic and go poof when air pet goes invis :)<br><br>Lozza<br>TZ ]</i></font><br><br>Some do&#8230; :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000202.html"><b>Summon Companion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Quote - Number 1 sounds like it might be a bug. Pretty rare case, but I'll pass that on to Ester. <br><br>Very nice of you to finally mention this, as I have personally submitted detailed information regarding this very case. <br><br>A couple things:<br>1) It is NOT a rare case. This is an absolute fact, which happens every time a pet owner gets charmed. I can personally duplicate this to any VI staff in-game as many times as they wish. GM's have replied to my /bugreport and /petition's saying it is intentional to force pet owners to camp or zone after getting charmed to regain the ability to summon / resummon a pet. <br><br>2) I have personally submitted this very problem to these boards in excess of 5 times. I have used /bug and /petition in-game over a dozen times submitting this very problem. So, though I am only one person, VI has heard of this bug many times. <br><br>3) Bug or intentional, it is NOT fair in "any" circumstance for pet owners to be stripped of their ability to summon / resummon their pet. If this is a bug, please fix it promptly. If this is intentional, please seek employment elsewhere. <br><br>4) The "rogue pet" fix only removed the ability for players to create a rogue pet without the intervention of a NPC. A pet which is charmed by a NPC will become a experience-giving KOS to everybody NPC if the pet owner zones. <br><br>I have personally had my level 54 water pet get charmed by the level 30ish NPC enchanter at the lake in Qeynos Hills. When I zoned back, there was my old water pet, scowling, and killing all NPC's that came within range, including the original NPC which charmed it. Fortunately, the pet gives pretty good experience per kill. <br><br>-Anthe ]</i></font><br><br>When I said that it sounded like a rare case, I meant just that. It's probably not that common that you get charmed. I have no problem believing that it happens every time you DO get charmed, just that being charmed isn't something that happens every day to a character. <br><br>And I looked it up. The bug has been in the database since December. So we are aware of it, and have been. Obviously we haven't been quick to fix the bug, but we are certainly aware of it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I commend Verant for giving this to all the pet classes, and realizing it has little to do with roleplay, balance, or power but is a nice solution to some gameplay limitations (i.e., pathing). Just why did it take you so long to reach that decision after granting it to Mages? This will be a big help to the main pet classes - mages and necros and is the appropriate level at 44 as at lvl 46 planes and bigger raids begin for most charaters. <br><br>Now if you would only do something about fear and resists for necro pets it just might provide the necro with one of their primary weapons in raids/epic encounters. <br><br>Sarasate ]</i></font><br><br>Well, this is a case where were conflicted. There was a feeling that we should try to further distinguish magicians and their power over their pets, and also the feeling that it would be a useful tool for any pet caster. <br><br>We decided to err (if we were indeed erring) on the side of caution and give it only to magicians (imagine the issues if we gave it to everyone first and then decided to make it a magician only spell&#8230;). After letting it stew a while, we've decided to change our minds. <br><br>As for the fear thing&#8230; you'll have to wait a bit and see what or if we do anything with that. The same issue applies here. But, unlike Summon Companion, there is no clear need for fear resistance as a matter of a gameplay issue. It is something to consider for a 'class balance' issue, but that issue is two-sided. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Please dont give this spell to Enchanters.. <br><br>Enchanters mess with the Mind and Enchant lumps of stuff.. <br><br>I do not want the ability to "Summon".

I suggest that you will find it useful in some cases. And, well, who in the world would say no to a new spell? Seems odd to me. <br><br>As for your concern that there is no 'roleplaying' reason to have it, I have the easy answer. Don't buy it if it doesn't fit your concept of an enchanter. <br><br>Aeadiel-Sevaan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Does this spell wipe pets aggro list? If it doesnt i think it should.

I'd imagine the necromancers out there wouldnt mind giving Goner someone to chat with who was likewise summoned to to anothers bidding. I can even see it now: Goner & Jibantik- of course, the militia wouldnt enjoy their jokes if the casters brought their act to the stage in freeport! ]</i></font><br><br>It is certainly a possibility that all pet classes could get Voice Graft.

Brad spoke on exploiting bugs in response to more feedback and letters received about the banning of the guild Conquest.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000211.html">update</a> from the Dev Corner:<UL>Hello all, <br><br>Recently I've not only received emails specifically regarding the Conquest guild issue, but also about exploiting in general. <br><br>First, some people are confused as to what an exploit is and how they're to know what an exploit is. Some are also afraid they might accidentally exploit and then be disciplined. <br><br>An exploit, quite simply, is using a bug in the game to your advantage. Most of them are obvious: attacking NPCs that are stuck, or the ability to duplicate items or money. But we do realize it's not always easy to tell. <br><br>To this end it has been and will continue to be our policy to warn people when they are caught exploiting. It basically works like this: <br><br>1. You are caught exploiting, you receive a warning and the exploit is explained to you.<br>2. You are caught exploiting again (this includes either literally being caught or caught and we have evidence you were aware it was an exploit -- in other words, premeditated exploiting) and you are suspended for a period of time.<br>3. You are caught exploiting yet again -- you are banned. <br><br>A second issue that's arisen is the question: why do we care if people are exploiting? Are we just upset they're not playing the game the way we wanted them to? <br><br>The answer is honestly "no, that has nothing to do with it." The following is an email and my reply to it which I think more clearly explains why we cannot allow bug exploitation in EverQuest: <br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: Robert Mayer <br>Sent: Tuesday, June 12, 2001 7:30 AM<br>To: bmcquaid@verant.com<br>Subject: Question <br><br><b>You guys seem to be holding players responsible for doing things the game allows but you don't intend to happen. You are labeling as "exploits" anything that is possible, but doesn't fit into the game as you designed it. </b><br><br>Then I guess I failed to communicate the issues very effectively, because that is absolutely NOT what we're doing. We are labeling exploits as we always have, that being using bugs to your advantage in-game. Conquest used spell stacking bugs to their advantage and they used a safe zone (an area where a pathing bug made it such that an NPC wouldn't pursue those it was mad at) to their advantage.<br><br><br><b>Now correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that in effect you're saying "look, we aren't perfect, we can't code a game that is 100% free of loopholes because nobody can, but you should as players be able to infer what we intend, and if you do things that are clearly going against our intent, that's an exploit and you'll be disciplined." </b><br><br>Yes and no. We're saying that taking advantage of bugs is NOT ok. And we're saying that 1. knowing you're exploiting a bug and 2. where and to what end your exploiting, are both factors in determining how we react to a player or players who are exploiting. <br><br><br><b>Whew. I've never heard a game company essentially say that the players are responsible for the developer's programming, design, and implementation errors. No offense, because I realize it's a bitch to run a game like EQ, but it seems absurd to me to expect players to do anything but try their utmost to use every single tool you give them, deliberately or accidentally, to succeed. After all, the only point of EQ, beyond chatting, is to level up, and the only rewards beyond the social come from leveling up and killing things. You put umpteen thousand people into a world and tell them "go forth and kill MOBs," and by gum they're gonna do it. You can't reasonably then expect them to adhere to something like "oh, and only kill MOBs the way we intend for you to kill them!" </b><br><br>No, they're responsible for not taking advantage of bugs in-between the time they're discovered and when we have a chance to fix them. And we've always had this policy. UO certainly has this policy, and I think AC does to an extent now. And I'd submit the majority of persistent, massively multiplayer community based games in the future will have these policies. Why? Well, because what you do in a community based game like this affects other players. If you take advantage of a dupe bug, you can hurt the economy, and ruin the play experience of hundreds if not thousands of other players. If you take advantage of a pathing bug and kill a monster to obtain loot that you really shouldn't be able to, then the guy who did work harder to obtain that same loot without exploiting is not going to feel very entertained. Rather, he's going to feel frustrated and perhaps even regret that he did it the 'right way'. It's the same as in real life -- society is generally NOT ok with taking short cuts (especially at the expense of others). Insider Trading is not ok. Cutting through a parking lot to avoid traffic is not ok. Embezzling and stealing and cheating to advance oneself at the expense of others is NOT ok. And so why the heck should it be ok in the communities and societies that are being developed in online computer games? Because it's a game? Does my sense of accomplishment and are my feelings about right and wrong somehow less valid inside a virtual reality than they are in the real world? <br><br>No man is an island, and that includes a person in Norrath.<br><br><br><b>From reading all of the public info on the Conquest incident, it seems to me that these guys simply took advantage of holes your programmers left in the game. If an NPC can't summon or move for X seconds or due to Y geometry, um, tough titty to you, Kitty--fix it. If you leave it in, you can't ethically blame someone for taking advantage of it. It's your responsibility, and you'rs (Verant's) alone, to make the game unexploitable. </b><br><br>Agreed to a point, and expanding on that, it's Verant's responsibility to make sure we are offering an entertaining and fair play environment for our customers. And so we fix bugs, and we also crack down on players who would use bugs to cheapen the playing experience of others.<br><br>And I disagree it's unethical to blame a player for taking advantage of a bug. If a person leaves the door open at their place of business, thereby creating a hole in the company's security, yes, it's the person's fault for doing this. But that doesn't mean it's ok for someone to come along and enter the building, taking advantage of the open door. He gets blamed too.<br><br><br><b>Now, if players change the code, hack it, or abuse other players, disciplinary action seems warranted. But to even bother suspending players whose only real "crime" seems to be to take advantage of coding problems on your end--well, you're asking way too much of your customers. </b><br><br>But taking advantage of coding or data problems can in some cases ABUSE OTHER PLAYERS, which is the point I apparently failed miserably to communicate, because it keeps coming up, not just in your email but in others.<br><br><br><b>Once you create the world, it isn't yours any more, just like when a novelist writes a book. If someone wants to interpret The Stand as an allegory about French cooking, there's nothing Stephen King can do about it. Yeah, an online game isn't as passive as a book, but it's the same concept. You guys seem to be holding on way too tight. Who cares if they "exploit" the flaws in the programming? Turn off the zone, fix the flaws, and go on. Every single exploit you guys identify should be seen as an opportunity to improve the game or refine it--that's good, and it's your right. But to discipline players for finding your mistakes&#8230; man, that's pretty low. </b><br><br>Again, reading a book is not a shared, community based experience. Misinterpreting a book, and for a better analogy, cheating in a single player game does NOT hurt the play experience for others. But, and this is the key point here, cheating in a shared community based online experience DOES. <br><br>thanks,<br><br>-- <br>--------------------------------------------- <br>Brad McQuaid <br>Vice President, Premium Games <br>Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive <br>---------------------------------------------</UL>

Banegrivm Shadowblight sends us the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>For some time now there have been strange occurrences happening about the <br>lands of Norrath as we know of it. Movements have taken place underneath the <br>city of Qeynos in an attempt to overthrow the King, the Curse of the <br>Plaguebringer rolls across the plains of Karana, and the Faceless comes to <br>drive away the Mother of All. It has been rumored of war and things to come <br>since the time of Aradune Mithara, the Avatar of Karana (also known as beta). <br><br>Much has happened and continues to happen throughout the lands as Town <br>Crier's now sell there news in cities all across Norrath. Many adventurers <br>have taken upon sword and spell alike to seek the cause of the many recent <br>uprising and strange events that seek to come to pass in Norrath in an ever <br>evolving story of events, yet to be revealed. <br><br>At first glance when such a realization had been made many adventurers bound <br>together and set about their reasearch in the sacred halls of army of light. <br>Here was set a tome called "We are at WAR and HERE is all the Info!" Due to <br>the success and popularity of it, the adventurers built a new home and forged <br>a centrall hall from which there can now be found an entire library of all <br>things to come to concern the affairs of these strange acrtivites in Norrath. <br><br>They may be found at <a href="http://www.1fol.cjb.net">http://www.1fol.cjb.net</a> under the Message Board therein <br>entitled, "The Great War of Norrath". The former Tomes of "We are at WAR and <br>HERE is the information!" and its sequal have both been placed within this <br>new library to be held charge over by the Erudite keepers. May the knowledge <br>we gather pave the way to a testament of arms, in the eternal battle of the <br>good and evil. <br><br><br>Till thy still rings true in battle, <br>Banegrivm Shadowblight <br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light <br>Inner War Council Member <br>Druzzil Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Banegrivm!
