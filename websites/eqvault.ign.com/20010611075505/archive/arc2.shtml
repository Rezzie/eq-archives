Spence sent this in:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings Citizens of Norrath!<br><br>The Combine Empire of Vallon Zek is holding a grand event to celebrate its revival and rise back to power. This 'Celebration of the Rebirth' will be taking place in the Northern reaches of the Desert of Ro (SUN MAY 20, 8:00 EST). <br> <br>Our healers will be setting up a medical station at the inn for young adventurers who wish to help patrol the desert (free heals and buffs to newcomers) and perhaps distributing some equipment to those wishing to pursue a life as a human purist crusader. <br><br>I urge all Humans as well as our pureblooded Erudite and Barbarian kin to attend this fair and join us in the celebration. As always no heathen races (non-human team) will be tolerated at the festivities and any caught will suffer a most heinous public execution. <br><br>OOC: If you don't play on Vallon Zek,or are relatively new to the server, this is a great opportunity to get a helping hand with a new character!</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for letting us know!

Rick sent in the following announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings Citizens of Norrath!<br><br> The Combine Empire is holding a grand event to celebrate its revival and rise back to power. This 'Celebration of the Rebirth' will be taking place in the Northern reaches of the desert of Ro (SUN MAY 20, 8:00 EST). Our healers will be setting up a medical station at the inn for young adventurers who wish to help patrol the desert (free heals and buffs to newcomers) and perhaps distributing some equipment to those wishing to pursue a life as a human purist crusader. <br><br> I urge all Humans as well as our pureblooded Erudite and Barbarian kin to attend this fair and join us in the celebration. As always no heathen races (non-human team) will be tolerated at the festivities and any caught will suffer a most heinous public execution.<br><br> A special invite goes out to our most valued allies the Shanks who have always stood by the side of the Empire in times of need.<br><br>Emperor Forestal of the Combine</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

Check out the latest tidbits from Alan directly from the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000165.html"><b>Charm Change</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: perhaps the bard above did not phrase it properly. Yes, it removes charm kiting as a solo method for bards, but that is because it practically removes charm as an effective bard too (I have played a bard, and I will vouch for this). <br><br>This means that bards have real trouble charming while soloing OR in groups. Actually, its a little easier soloing because the bard can simply keep swapping charmed targets. This is not viable in groups. <br><br>I understand the need to fix exploits, but please take a close look at this soon. Bard charm was a great part of crowd control when an enchanter was not available (hey, I can't be EVERYWHERE at once), and I would hate to see them lose this. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Leirra ]</i></font><br><br>Oh, don't misunderstand me. We certainly understand how this change affects group play to. My only point was that the fact that the change makes soloing harder isn't a very persuasive argument. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000164.html"><b>Imbue Caution</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I caution you to be careful if you're going to allow bards to imbue gems. If you are going to let one religion of bards do it, you must let them all do it. <br><br>I play a bard that worships Karana, which only confers role-playing benefits to me; there are no in-game mechanics benefits for a bard worshipping Karana. And as such, I would feel offended if bards of one religion could imbue their own gems, and I could not. Agnostic bards, who already have advantages over non-agnostic bards with faction, would not be hurt by this since the advantage gained by their faction is greater than that gained by imbuing gems. <br><br>--Daveon Silverstring<br>--50th level bard, Brell Serilis ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I'm not a subscriber to slippery slope arguments. Yes, we have to consider how people will feel if they don't get to do something others can do. But there's no 'must let them do it' involved here. <br><br>Look at it this way. The reason for letting Veeshan worshipping bards imbue gems is because no worshipper or Veeshan can imbue gems, so worshippers of Veeshan are left out. Therefore we 'must' let them do it? Maybe&#8230; <br><br>You bard can get imbued armor, a Veeshan bard can't. That's really the concern to be addressed. The fact that other bards can't imbue gems isn't going to be an issue of game play. It might be an issue about game universe consistency and player concern, but we won't need to add imbue ability to other bards for game balance or gameplay reasons. <br><br>No final decision has been made here about this, and we'll talk over the consequences. But to me having the armor available (so as not to be a restriction for Veeshan worshipping bards) is more important than making the imbue spell available to all bards (not so much a restriction on other bards, as a lack of an advantage&#8230;).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just to respond to the comments on camping a fixed spawn being boring... <br><br>Boredom is an emotion, not a pre-existant state. If I want action or companionship in EQ but spend my time solo, killing the same 6 minute spawn over and over, then clearly I am going to be bored and frustrated. <br><br>If, on the other hand, I am listening to a good play on the radio or reading an exciting novel, then the control and predictability and minimal need for attention at a fixed spawn is ideal. <br><br>Add to that an existential appreciation for the easthetic of repetition (should be familiar to all devotes of Philip Glass or The Velvet Underground) and solo single spawn camping becomes less about boredom and more about art. <br><br>The thing is, lots of people enjoy moaning, me included. But if they didn't at some level have "fun" camping static spawns, they wouldn't do it. <br><br>Anyway, you see a lot less of it than did before Velious came out. It's going out of fashion, but I still enjoy a bit of retro-boredom chic once in a while.]</i></font> <br><br>:)<br><br>And, actually, you do make a very good point. If people do it, it must be what they want to do. <br><br>Chris_B wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Other things that would be good to build quests round are other skills besides Tradeskills. <br><br>For example, a quest could require you to 'Beg' a quest item off a NPC. To do this you would need to have a high Begging skill. Some quests already require a high Forage Skill (Druid/Ranger Epic for example.) <br><br>Or you may have to kill an NPC that can only be hit with 2HB weapons or a NPC that runs realy fast away from you and is totally Magic Imune so you have to use range weapons. <br><br>Some players take a lot of time to get other skills up besides tradeskills. It would be nice to have quests to reward them too. ]</i></font><br><br>Hehe, beggar quests&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000170.html"><b>Douglas Adam's Passing</b></a><br>We've discovered that almost everyone on the team is a fan of Douglas Adams. We've been zapping emails with quips and quotes around the office all week. I'm still in that stage where disbelief is stronger than acceptance. <br><br>Sleepycleric is correct. Even those that have never read his books have been influenced by his work in so many ways. Several of us here, including myself, attribute a large part of our sense of humor to him. <br><br>Thanks for all the responses and suggestions. I'll keep a list for the team.</UL>

From Lava:<BLOCKQUOTE>Sing Lung is an editor in "real life" and the editor-in-chief of our new online magazine <a href="http://www.fanstory.com/fanmag/">fanMAG</a>. In the interview she offers advice on how writers can improve their work. She also talks about her motivation for her book <a href="http://www.fanstory.com/displayStory.asp?id=286">Path of the Dragon</a> and her love of massive multiplayer gaming.<P>An Excerpt:--<P>---------------<P><b>FanStory.com:</b> How would you suggest a writer improve his writing?<br><br><b>SingLung:</b> Learn to read critically, and learn to take criticism. Read and review as many stories as you can. Pay close attention to how the author writes -- what pulls you in to the story, and what knocks you out of it. If you don't like a story, figure out why. When you get a critical review, give the reviewer's suggestions some serious thought (as long as they are constructive). Try them out. You might be surprised if you do -- or you might find a better solution. When a critique puts me on the defensive or makes me feel compelled to explain my story, that tells me I should pay attention to it. It doesn't mean the reviewer is necessarily right, it just means I might not be getting my point across as well as I thought. <P>------------<P><a href="http://www.fanstory.com/displayStory.asp?id=904">The Interview</a><P>Thanks,<br>Lava</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Get the skinny on what's been happening on the Developer's Corner by reading today's Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000142.html"><b>Guide Account Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've always wanted to be a guide, and it seems my attempts have always been thrwarted. I enjoy helping people, which is the main reason why my main isn't even to level 40 yet. But, here is what you said: <br><br>1) You must have an active, and in good standing, EverQuest account.<br>2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<br>3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<br>4) You will need good communication skills.<br>5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<br>6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must. <br><br>I'm 17, which I guess is a tough break for me, other than the fact you're missing out on an excellent guid. =P But why? Legality reasons? People don't responsible until they are legally an adult? <br><br>And why the no-shared account? It doesn't apply to me, but my local EQ friend shares his account with his brother. His brother is pretty trustworthy from what I've seen, and doesn't want anything to do with guides. If you're worried about his brother logging on and doing un-guidely things, then you shouldn't. I thought the Guide Application asked for another password other then your EQ account's one, but it may have changed since I checked it last time. We were kinda hoping (however slim the chance) that we could be Guide-Mates, but now there isn't even a slight possibility of it happening... <br><br>Just curious about the above, and thanks for listening. Hope you'll need more guides for Luclin. I'll be 18 by then! <br><br>~RivenClaw ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, the age restriction is a legal issue. At 18 you are considered an adult, for the most part, and you are responsible for your own actions. We certainly have nothing against people under that age of 18, but we need to follow certain guidelines (I'm no lawyer, and I'm not going to let one post here, either :))<br> <br>And, well, sharing your account is against the EULA. Someone that is unwilling to follow the instructions in the EULA might not be the best candidate to be a guide. <br><br>And, well, letting anyone log on to your guide account is not acceptable. Sure, that person might be trustworthy. But there have been so many cases of trustworthy people giving out passwords that it's not even funny. And, well, if that person wants to become a guide, that's great. Run them through the approval process and let us be responsible for making them a guide. Letting someone use your guide account is very inappropriate. <br><br>Don't share your account, please. Far too many people are hurt by doing so.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000164.html"><b>Cleric Imbue Spell</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Maybe da truth is dat Veeshan just no wana give her power ta some stinky bard gem. <br><br>-Lary da Troll, Slayer a Stinky Bards]</i></font> <br><br>Well, Lary, I'm not going to comment on the stinkiness of Bards as it that might relate to Trolls of any particular class&#8230; <br><br>But I have been hearing rumors that we might have a way of getting a bard song to imbue gems. I'm mentioning this now, though I really shouldn't. We haven't actually tried to get it to work yet, and we most certainly won't try it until after E3 some time. But it might be something we can make work. I just don't want you all to get your hopes up. <br><br>I'm off to take a shower or something&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing For Experience</b></a><br>Lithandar_Lorathian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "For me, if doing something is fun, that's why <br>I'll do it. If questing is more fun than <br>camping, then why are people camping? <br><br>The only answer that I can think of is that some <br>people get more fun out of gaining levels and <br>items than they do out of playing the game. So <br>that they will trade two hours of fun for two <br>hours of something they are not enjoying and <br>some experience and loot. "<br><br>I think the main problem with your comment is this: <br><br>Yes, doing something I have fun at is much more rewarding than something I don't entirely enjoy, however, once I've done all the quests that are around my level and there aren't any more suited for me until i reach a significantly higher level it's right back to camping for levels until I can do the next quests. <br><br>I don't entirely belive quests should give out more xp than they do, maybe if they didn't give any items out that would be nice, then again, my highest level character is 27th, so I don't know what higher level quests yield. I simply think there should be many many more quests.. ]</i></font><br><br>There are probably gaps in places where there aren't enough quests. Creating more quests is a good thing on all accounts. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "For me, if doing something is fun, that's why I'll do it. If questing is more fun than camping, then why are people camping? <br><br>"The only answer that I can think of is that some people get more fun out of gaining levels and items than they do out of playing the game. So that they will trade two hours of fun for two hours of something they are not enjoying and some experience and loot." <br><br>Forget about the people that think camping is boring. If I understand you correctly; <br><br>If I am a person that has fun camping, I can reasonably expect to have fun AND get loot AND get nice exp. But if I *also* have fun doing the quests, then I must simply accept the fact that it may be fun, but provides no experience and not much loot. <br><br>Is this a correct interpretation? <br><br>Players, and casual players especially, will allot their time in-game to the activity that produces the best rewards within the limited time window. Measurements include number of items gained, amount of cash obtained, and even number of bubbles of experienced gained. Is it unreasonable to think quests might have numbers that at least come close to those for camping? <br><br>With the current state of things, players sit on their butts at a spawn site because that activity seems to produce the best results for the time spent on-line. Thus, questing is something few people participate in with any regularity. Given the name of the game on the box, this tends to produce some consternation in the players. <br><br>I must state for the record that this is an extremely fun game and all participants in it's development have done an astounding job. I am a software developer by trade, and I fully understand the difficulties in achieving such a task. That the people at Verant have produced such a fine product still amazes me. <br><br>That said, somebody needs to refocus on which in-game activities, questing or camping, produce the best rewards and do so from the *players* perspective. After all, is the name of this game Everquest, or Neverquest? <br><br>Lanceor d'Avignon<br>Paladin of Mith Marr<br>Xegony ]</i></font><br><br>Well, you are sort of correct. First of all, the assumption that quests don't give rewards of experience or loot isn't true. Sure, some quests don't give much loot or experience. And if you are turning in Gnoll fangs at 40th level, you're not going to feel well rewarded at all. <br><br>But a lot of quests do give out fair experience for their completion. Many quests are all about the item that you earn for doing them. So to characterize questing as something unrewarding isn't very fair. <br><br>Also, consider a simple quest, turning in Gnoll fangs in Qeynos. <br><br>If you are of the level where taking on the Gnolls of Blackburrow is a challenge, then completing that quest is, basically, free additional experience to be gained when you head to town to bank. So for quests like that any experience is pretty much enough, considering that turning in the fangs literally takes two or three minutes. <br><br>However, I will easily concede that there are quests that do not give out a large reward for the work that needs to be done to complete them. <br><br>But there is a catch to giving rewards for quests. For example, the recently hyped shark meat quest (or the Tumpy Tonic quest, if you want to go back a ways). The shark meat quest was put in with the intent that people would have to go kill sharks to get meat, or at least travel a long way to buy them from other PCs. Then we added vendors for shark meat as part of our ongoing changes to trade skills. We, basically, made the quest an experience and cash making machine. <br><br>Any quest that requires killing something gives experience for killing that thing (though you could have gotten that experience without the quest), so adding more experience or loot is a bonus. And quests that don't require killing things can easily be broken and abused. <br><br>I could go off on a tangent and argue that a casual player trying to maximize the value of his play time for reward/minute isn't actually playing an a casual way, but that's not where we want to go. :)<br><br>Regardless, the point you are making is certainly valid. And these are issues that we are looking into (well, right now we're looking into three days of trade show&#8230;). <br><br>Babbster wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just one tiny point of light here, and that's that "camping" doesn't always have to be boring, annoying, etc. What's wrong with six friends hanging out, killing some monsters, drinking virtual liquor, doing virtual dances, etc.? If people aren't having fun while camping, then it's not just a question of why they're doing it, but HOW they're doing it. After all, a necromancer or druid sitting by him or herself for hours on end OF COURSE is going to be boring. Maybe they'll learn someday. But six people who already know and like one another can sit for hours on end in one place in Everquest and have loads of fun (even sometimes when they don't get the MoB/item they were hoping for). It's all about perspective, though I will admit that I am a fan of the dungeon crawl myself. :)]</i></font><br><br>Good point. Yes, hanging out with people can be fun, and if you do that while camping, then camping can be fun. I've spent a few hours camping the gates of Qeynos playing hide and seek&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I would like to clear up why people camp XP and loot rather than just go and do what they consider fun. The reason people do this is because nothing is fun forever. <br><br>At level 20, there are places you can go and things you can do, but they will not stay fun for you forever, especially when there are new experiences waiting at higher levels. Want to go explore Kedge Keep? Want to go visit the dark, foreboding basement of Unrest? Do you want to go purge Mistmoore of evil? Well, if you want to do those things, you are going to need a few things. One of those is a higher level, and another thing is better equipment. It goes without saying that you will need skills and contacts as well. <br><br>I could go out and do what is fun at my level, but I've done that. If I want to see new areas, I need levels and loot. So my entire spiel breaks down into 2 parts. 1. Nothing stays fun forever, you can only do things at your level so many times before it gets less fun than finding new areas. 2. If you want to go to new areas, you need levels and loot. I submit to you that that is the reason why people camp experience and loot. <br><br>Whim Dreamstalker<br>44 enchie<br>Emarr ]</i></font><br><br>True. Nothing is fun forever. And gaining levels allows you to change the things you are doing. <br><br>But having fun does not mean never gaining experience. You can goof around and gain experience. You do not have to sit and stare at an empty orc camp. Sure, there are times when you want to concentrate on gaining experience, no matter how prone to goofing around you are. But even then, camping spawns isn't your only choice. <br><br>I'm not trying to tell you that we can't make some inroads on improving the volume, reward, and general fun level of quests. But I'm also not willing to accept that a quest isn't fun unless it gives a good reward, or that a quest sucks unless it gives good loot and experience. Fun is NOT exclusively judged by how much loot you get.

This causes that reactionary effect with the rest of your group to keep up. Once you reach that level, soon, another in your group gets close, and he spends time trying to get exp quick, so he can gain his new abilities. Thus, once again, the rest of the group is forced to keep up. Soon in order to remain grouping with your friends, your all just camping for experience, and not truly getting the full enjoyment of the eq experience. <br><br>If we had quests that gave us experience, real worthwhile experience, I think you'd see a change for the better. <br><br>This is my theory anyway, at least from my observances. <br><br>Crohmm Stormfury<br>55th Warrior of Rodcet Nife<br>The "Blade" of VENGEANCE ]</i></font><br><br>I agree. I'm certainly affected by a desire to reach the next spell circle or combat skill. But I tend to avoid doing things that I don't find fun in order to get that reward. <br><br>As for staying within the level range of your group, that's sometimes hard. The trick that I use is that I play with more than one group. :)  Scheduling a few days as play days for each group works out well. People tend to stay within level ranges if we try to play only on the given nights together. If you miss one night, that's not going to cause a problem. <br><br>But that's how I approach it, as a casual gamer.

Choose the Producer's Letter from January 14th, 2001. <br><br>I'll copy the relevant part here.

I think that overall the changes were very good. The method used to "remove" the experience penalty for those classes that had them (and were sharing them with their groups) works well... mostly. <br><br>The reason for having the experience sharing in groups the way that it had been since launch, as I understand it, was so that friends grouping together could stay together regardless of the classes they were playing. Well I must say, that system worked wonderfully. I play in a group with 5 RL friends. We started our characters together and do not play for experience unless we are playing together. Some of us do some trading or trade skills outside of the group. We play once a week for about 2.5 hours a session. We have been doing so for more than 20 months. We've stayed together easily through that time, advancing at the same pace, until recently. We have a warrior in our group who has started to outpace the rest of us. Due to the frequency of our playing (and several missed sessions) it has taken a few months to really see the difference. Since the experience bonus for warriors and rogues was not accounted for at the same time the experience penalty was for hybrids and intellegence based casters, groups of friends that play together can no longer stay together. <br><br>The idea of having a system that allows a group of friends like us to do what we are doing was a great one that apparently became pretty obvious during the beta testing. The changes to the experience system breaks that for any groups that have warriors or rogues in them, especially once the warrior's or rogue's level exceeds the rest of the group. They then start taking a larger percentage of the experience before class modifiers are applied. <br><br>Is there anything that can be done about this? Do you have suggestions for dealing with it? <br><br>Gruthil Roberts<br>22 Enchanter<br>Quellious ]</i></font><br><br>I figured I may as well tackle these issues together, since they are both relatively old issues about experience. <br><br>Actually, we looked at this very carefully. No matter what class or race combination you choose, if you play together at all times, characters will never gain a gap wide enough that they can't gain experience together. In fact, I think I remember that the widest possible gap was about two levels by the time they reach 60th level. But that was a while back, and it might have been three levels. But even at the extreme characters that play together will always be within experience range for grouping. And with the way experience is divided now, there is a slight advantage to the lower level group members that helps to prevent separation. <br><br>I'm not sure what is happening with your warrior.</UL>

Here are the latest information given by Alan from off of the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000134.html"><b>Flowing Thoughts</b></a><br>Let me start here with an apology. Someone pointed out that I was ranting a bit with my last post, and I was. I shouldn't be doing that. I apologize. <br><br>Aarreran-CrimRen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Even though I agree with you that Flowing Thought isn't a bad thing, I though I'd point out that you were dead wrong when you said... <br><br>"It only appears on items found in the Plane of Hate and are no drop. So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this."<br> <br>This is 100% incorrect. An item was found with Flowing Thought I on a Giant in Great Divide who was apart of the ring quest. Not only was an item with Flowing Thought I found on him, but an item with Flowing Thought II was found as well.]</i></font> <br><br>Yup, it seems to be the case that there are a few of the super high powered Flowing Thought II items available as well&#8230; <br><br>Flowing Thought II is, well, a little better than Flowing Thought. It is still far less useful than Clarity (though it might rival Breeze&#8230;), and it still stacks with all of those spells, so it's still not much of an issue. I would agree that an item better than that might be worthy of some concern, even if it does stack with Clarity. <br><br>And, as one reader has pointed out, there are in fact a few Clarity items in the game. <br><br>There are perhaps three items in the game that have the ability to cast Clarity II on their wielder (and only on the wielder). When I say three, I mean three total, across all the servers. These are, in fact, artifacts given out at two of the gatherings. As far as I know, no more of these items will ever come into the game (though I suppose they might, it's not part of any current plan, that's for sure). <br><br>Were these items dropping off any NPC in the game, no matter how rare, I would be concerned. But having three of them on all the servers should have absolutely no effect on the desire for enchanters or bards. <br><br>This one is kinda long, so I'm going to respond within the post. My comments are not bolded. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings Absor, <br><br>I was reading over the post you made regarding wizards and I had a couple comments. Forgive me but I dont know the codes for this board. <br><br>Absor said: "Wizards can't sustain their damage output in fights that last longer than those that existed before Velious. This is the issue you're heading at. And, sure, giving Wizards a larger mana pool or a form of massive mana regeneration would fix it. But it also makes them more efficient in all other forms of casting. " <br><br>Mostly true. The wizard community feels it doesn't do enough damage, which is our primary focus. You mention that giving us 'massive' mana regeneration would too greatly benefit our other casting abilities and you would have to compensate. <br><br>Raising mana cost of non-dmg spells seems reasonable given what a wizard is, dmg caster, but mana regeneration may not entirely be the solution. At least in my opinion it isn't because of other problems wizards experience: ie agro. I dont have a useable skill\spell to lower my agro so typical raid fights entail casting and waiting for melees to rebuild up agro for me to cast again. THIS is why mana regeneration isnt entirely the solution for wizards. It may help, but in raid scenarios wont solve our problems. <br><br>To put it simply, wizards have 2 problems:<br>1) Low dmg<br>2) High agro doing that dmg. ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, I don't agree that wizards have problem #1. Low damage needs to be qualified with a 'compared to', in other words 'Low damage when compared with what a rogue can do over the course of ten minutes of continuous fighting' or 'Low damage when compared to what any other class can do when dumping mana to finish something off'. I'd say yes to one and no to the other. The problem is that when you make comparisons like that it's all in the wording. <br><br>As for #2, well, no more aggro than anyone else that does the same damage in the same time frame. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Mana regen solves 1, but makes 2 worse. ]</i></font><br><br>If wizards could suddenly regenerate mana at ten times the rate they do now, they could control their aggro, and in fact aggro control would be the only limit on their damage potential. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Not true. Casters are just as AC and HP dependent as anyone else. It's just that their hit points come in the form of melee classes and pets, in much the same way that melee characters draw their hit points from healers and their speed from casters." <br><br>You should stress this more as it is the crux for grouping in EQ. Unfortunately, if any two of those become too strong the third isn't necessary. Velious fights last minutes and in that duration melee is the most effective damage source. In that context, healer-melee is the only dynamic that matters. Casters just are added to fill in the gaps if necessary. ]</i></font><br><br>Agreed. And this is the place where the imbalance exists. But people too easily forget that when you are comparing melee damage to caster damage, you have to keep in mind that there are two people doing that melee damage, the melee and the healer. Take away the healer and your melee isn't going to live long enough to outdamage the caster in question. <br><br>But it is this situation where the imbalance exists, and it is these situations that we are aiming to fix. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Heck, wizards have a great damage over time ratio and this isn't even something that we're looking at improving." ]</i></font> <br><br>This, to me, doesn't make much sense. You mentioned above it was something being considered as a result of Wizard Talk. So how can we have 'great damage over time ratio'? Maybe explaining your qualifications for this would make it clear because in nearly all raiding fights melees do more than me. <br><br>Perhaps we're thinking of different uses of the term 'damage over time'. A lot of the responses sent in were telling me that a melee character does a lot more damage over an hour than a wizard. That's probably true at the upper levels. But what about over the course of one minute? If an NPC is fleeing, who finishes it off? I was thinking of damage over time as it relates to most fights, not the rare long fight one can encounter in Velious, since I've covered that separately. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said RE dmg/mana: "Bane spells. Other than that, I don't know." <br><br>I am not sure if you know this Absor, maybe ask Poe about it for further detail, but banes have a very very select group of creatures it can hit. About 10 in game roughly I would guess can be hit by both banes. Being effective on about 10 mobs doesn't make us more attractive. Just means you CoH in the wizards when you are getting ready for the final boss NPC. You also have to be level 60 to use them. ]</i></font><br><br>I know exactly how the bane spells work. That 'select group of creatures' are exactly the creatures that take a long time to kill. They are the creatures where the wizard has the greatest problems, and is the exact group of combats that we wanted to target. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Isn't now, hasn't been in the past, probably won't be in the future. Just because you are the 'best' at travel does not mean that travel is what you do best." <br><br>Cool. <br><br>:)<br><br>-Alch ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, I've received a lot of comments that were much less&#8230; polite that Alch's comment. I'm not going to repost them here. But I'll address their concerns. <br><br>Too frequently folks get caught up in their current concern and don't step back to look at the big picture (I hate the phrase, someone get me a new one&#8230;). If we do something that allows Wizards to crank out the damage on high hit point NPCs in any way other than bane spells, then the life expectancy of old world NPCs would be nil. Improve the ratios of damage for Wizard spells to make them effective in the places where they feel weak now, and they destroy the old world with but a thought. <br><br>And I've noted that every (and I mean EVERY) person that has sent in some numbers showing how their wizard can't do the damage of a melee character sends in data comparing them to a rogue that has Ragebringer and is constantly backstabbing? Is that a good comparison? Keep in mind that the rogue is a three person damage dealer. He needs a tank and someone to heal that tank to do his damage. It might be fairer to add the damage dealt by all three of those people in a fight and divide by three, then compare&#8230; <br><br>The problem is that we're comparing melee and spell damage, and that's not a good comparison. The two are very different. <br><br>Group desirability is the other thing that is most mentioned about Wizards. They say they aren't. I argue that if there were no complaints about your ability to deal damage, then there would be no problem getting groups&#8230; But we also have plans that will dramatically reduce the problem with getting groups at higher levels. I can't tell you about it until we get it working and until we're done with the balancing stuff, but it will make a wizard desirable to groups. <br><br>I hate to say this, but it might be possible that part of the reason that a wizard might not be getting invited to groups is that you've spent so much time telling everyone how you aren't useful&#8230; It's hard to tell the sequence of events here, it's a chicken and the egg thing. But I often worry that this might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Tell enough people that you're not useful and they will believe you. <br><br>This may not be true, but I worry about it nonetheless. <br><br>I received and e-mail from a friend this morning, saying many of the things that many of you have said. He said something though, that struck a cord with me. He mentioned something about Wizards in literature and how they are something to be feared. <br><br>They sure are. But, well, Gandalf isn't a balanced character. He can't exist in Norrath because then there would be a majority of these literature-based character class and few of the others. Tolkien never needed to balance gameplay with Mithrandir in mind. We do. <br><br>I know that what I've been saying sounds like I don't understand your point of view. But my concern here is that you don't see mine. There is more to balancing a class than just turning up the damage volume until everyone that plays that class is happy. It's not that easy. <br><br>Keep sending in your comments, we'll read them all. But for now I'm not going to make more comments on balance issues until we're done with our run through of all the classes.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000112.html"><b>Special Food Items</b></a><br>Nynfolyn wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I may be mistaken, but so far I have been unable to eat any food by right-clicking on it if the food is in a bag.

No positive faction will be gained from PvP combat. <br><br>Unfortunately, giving anything positive at all for PvP combat tends to be abusable, since someone could simply have a friend create a character to kill to gain whatever benefit is given.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000162.html"><b>Travelers Boots</b></a><br>Saeul wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan: <br><br>You need to acknowledge the level of desparation that people feel regarding the Journeyman Boots and the Traveler's Boots. People have been frustrated beyond words at the additional barriers and frustration put in their way. You need to acknowledge it and explain WHY it's being done, not just say 'that is the way it is'. <br><br>It is NOT the way it is, it is the way Verant has DESIGNED it to be. Explain why. An explanation could go like this: <br>*beginning of one suggested dialog*<br>Folks I wanted to take a moment to have a short dialog with you on the Journeyman Boots/Traveler's Boots situation. We recognize that this one quest has continued to be a sore spot and we are taking an action that we hope will improve the situation. <br><br>On the one hand, it isn't fair to everyone who spent time and effort getting Journeyman Boots have their accomplishment trivialized. On the other hand, just money isn't, by itself, a sufficient 'effort' to replace the JBoots quest. So we made two decisions that you now see: <br><br>1. You must have faction to buy the boots. This affects those who hunted for Melatite, Charred Guardian Shields, etc. If you perceive your faction is SO BAD that you'll never qualify to buy the Traveler's Boots, then you are no worse off than you were--you can still do the Journeyman Boots quest. <br><br>2. You do not get as good of an item. The Traveler's Boots are somewhat inferior to the Journeyman Boots. This was intentional and is done to avoid the problem of trivializing other people's efforts. <br><br>In closing, I hope you see that we do care about our playerbase and we are trying to make the game more accessible without making it 'easy'. That is a difficult trade off and we're just people making tough decisions about how those trade offs work. Please allow us the latitude to come up with these ideas and try them out. <br><br>Trust us that we are trying really hard to keep the big picture in sight.<br><br>*end of suggested dialog*<br><br>Clearly this kind of discussion COULD cause more problems than it solves, but with your control of the message board, I doubt you'll actually find that negative of a response. ]</i></font><br><br>What he said&#8230; <br><br>Actually, that's pretty close to the truth. <br><br>Traveler's Boots are, however more than somewhat inferior to Journeyman's Boots. Because of the casting time they can not be used while moving. Because of that they won't be very useful as tools for kiting, and they will, primarily, be useful for travelling. <br><br>But most of what you say is true. I guess the problem here is that I thought those points were rather obvious (as they seem to be to you), so I didn't specify them very clearly. <br><br>And I don't think I ever said that they are as they are just because they are that way. I thought I was pretty clear that we put them there on purpose, not that they fell there by random chance. I'm not sure how you got the impression that I was even suggesting that they were placed in game by fate or some other such thing. No, we put them there and we did it on purpose. We thought out the ramifications and are content with them. <br><br>I'm sorry if I sounded equivocal about that, because we certainly are not. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Two more points: <br><br>3. Traveler's Boots aren't as desirable as Journeyman's Boots, since they have a casting time <br><br>4. For the price of Traveler's Boots, I could buy a *lot* of SoW potions. Suddenly the price of a SoW potion seems pretty reasonable to me... <br><br>-Azlina Crafte [Ebony Order]<br><br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks. <br><br>We understand the concern that some people have over the possibility of harm to the salability of Blood of Wolf potions. We don&#8217;t think that this will be a problem, we think that the sales of these potions might drop a little, but that they will still be valuable and salable. The truth is that nobody knows what will happen until it happens. So let's see how it goes.</UL>

Alan announced some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000169.html">very important news</a> about the upcoming patch on the Developer's Corner today:<UL>Our next patch is planned for May 30th, probably some time in the wee morning hours here on the West Coast.<br>The important part of the message is not that, though. It's this:<br><br>Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch. GMs will have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost. That means that they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one. It also means that I should remind everyone that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning.<br><br>So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch. We're not expecting a lot of corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of them disappearing.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Check out what Alan's been saying in today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000155.html"><b>Ragefire</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Once again, the point is missed. There is no complaint about the difficulty of the quest. The complaint is that a situation rife with conflict is created. Constant fighting over the Ragefire spawn is creating much conflicts between players and guilds. Some guilds have gone as far as assigning members time slots to continually camp the zone to alert the guild as to when the spawn is up and to shout out that they have the spawn camped. Since Verant refuses to regulate these types of actions in any way, naturally conflict arises when others try to come in to "take" the spawn. This is only one example of increased conflict and fighting in the game. The planes are another good example. Since the planes went to free for all, guilds are not fighting with each other over the boss and mini boss spawns, specifically in Hate and Fear. Verant needs to take a look at this closely and perhaps come up with some sort of plan to reduce this conflict. ]</i></font><br><br>I don't think I missed the point at all, though I readily admit that I might have. So I'll try again to explain myself. <br><br>What if Ragefire was to just appeared every 3 days right smack in the center of North Karana, at exactly the same time and in exactly the same place? Hand him the quest item and he hands you the epic and then goes away for 3 more days. No spawn timer issues, no trigger issues, just hand this guy an item every three days. Even if it was set up like that, there would be just as much controversy over him. <br><br>The problem here has very little to do with any of the spawn timers, spawn triggers, or any of that stuff. The problem is almost entirely caused by the volume of characters wanting to complete this epic. In the imaginary scenario above you would have just as many people waiting for the 3 day spawn, there would be just as much fighting over who should get to turn in their item to get the epic. You'd be just as frustrated as you are now. <br><br>The reason that the only suggestions that I have about fixing this issue seem negative is because they are. The only way to reduce the conflict here is to reduce the number of people clawing at each other to get this item. To do that we'd either have to make the quest a lot harder or make the item less desirable. I suppose the other solution is to let the item come into the game faster, but we're not going to do that. <br><br>I'm still willing to go back to the team and try to make the quest much harder all down the line. But most would consider that a nerf. And I suspect that even if it was a lot harder to do the quest, with all the desire for this item there would be just as many clerics lined up at whatever choke points there are fighting with each other over this thing. <br><br>I don't see that I'm missing anything here. 30 to 50 clerics and all of their friends fighting to get an item that can only come into the game so often is going to cause conflict.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000168.html"><b>Poll of Interest</b></a><br>Just passing this on.

I accidently put /move in my message bar and got an error message about how to use move log appropriately (apparently you must put yes afterwards).

Are the automatically signed up for the next move log should it occur? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Syran Alchion<br>32 Cleric of Tunare<br>Flame of the Phoenix<br>Tarew Marr ]</i></font><br><br>Not a problem. Move logs need to be 'opened' before the command will do anything. If you do the command before or after the move log is open, nothing happens.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>Populations and Economies</b></a><br>Dr_syKosis wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: How about a certain variation of the armor-eating dragon? <br><br>Let's say the entrance to this dragon's lair is protected by a sentry who you either a) must kill (but is lvl 65, death touches, regens, mana sinks, cheetah speed, etc... you get the point) or b) requires a certain piece of equipment to get in. <br><br>If, for example, there are too many Yaks in the game, program him so he asks for a Yak in order for your group to pass. Make it a table of loot he will ask for so it's different each time. <br><br>This dragon will of course drop uber class specific god-loot, but more importantly will decrease the saturation of "old-world" items in the game. If you make the spawn of the dragon long, but worthwhile, the item loss won't be at such a drastic pace that it'll upset the economy. I'm sure he won't eat a Yak a day, but maybe a Yak a month would work! ]</i></font><br><br>Also a nice idea. I'm not sure about actually being able to do it in the game as it is, though. Allowing an NPC to wait to be aggressive based on you NOT doing something might be kinda hard. <br><br>But some variation on that theme might work nicely. <br><br>Thanks. <br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I would like to make a suggestion regarding both the quantity of high level items as well as the population bulge of high level characters. <br><br>I'd like to see a retirement quest. Something that requires the character to have many of the higher level items to complete. Once complete, the character would become unplayable. The reward for such a quest would need to be fame. Name in lights sort of thing about which guilds and players could compete and brag. Or perhaps a nodrop, obscure, not terribly useful item that could stack and thus be counted. A moving on, as it were, to the next step in their karmic evolution. <br><br>Aidal Teamnoir - cleric35, druzzil ro ]</i></font><br><br>I've always liked the idea of retiring characters. But, well, in reality most of us want to be able to play those characters again some day. It's pretty unlikely that anyone would retire a character without some sort of fantastic reward. Fame would be good, but might not be enough. The idea of 'morphing' characters upon retirement would be pretty cool (retiring a character would open up a new class or race that can only be accessed this way), but would require a lot of creativity and balance and testing and all that, for a return that would only go to a few. <br><br>I really like the idea, but I'm not sure it's practical. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: NOOO BAD IDEAA!!!

Turbo-looting your own corpse is one too. <br><br>Now lets discuss putting mana regen on baked goods... /snicker[/b] <br><br>I've never seen a baked good that really needed mana that badly. <br><br>&#8230; <br><br>I'll have to answer this next one within the post. My comments are the ones that are not bolded. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Regarding the balancing of Melee vs Caster Haste items, to rebut your arguments: <br><br>1. Most caster spells are offensive in nature, at least for certain classes. ]</i></font><br><br>I agree. For some classes a lot of spells are offensive. But only for some casters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. If a class has some utility spells to burn mana on as well, how does that make a mana regen spell more unbalancing?]</i></font> <br><br>Because they could cast more of those spells than they can currently. When looking for a solution for a specific problem, I want answers that only target that particular problem. Since even without reading further I know where you're headed, let's state the perceived problem. Wizards can't sustain their damage output in fights that last longer than those that existed before Velious. This is the issue you're heading at. And, sure, giving Wizards a larger mana pool or a form of massive mana regeneration would fix it. But it also makes them more efficient in all other forms of casting. To 'balance' that out, we'd have to increase the mana cost on all non-damage wizards spells. <br><br>I'd rather find a more specific solution. And the bane spells are a good solution. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. Casters are totally mana dependant, melees are not totally attack speed dependant (their HP/AC is as useful as their damage output in tank cases) ]</i></font><br><br>Not true. Casters are just as AC and HP dependent as anyone else. It's just that their hit points come in the form of melee classes and pets, in much the same way that melee characters draw their hit points from healers and their speed from casters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. So long as they stack w/ Bard/Chanter spells, they do not hurt the other classes. ]</i></font><br><br>Agreed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5. Flowing Thought I is so miniscule it's ridiculous... imagine a melee getting a drop from Cazic that gave +0.5% haste... ]</i></font><br><br>Also agreed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 6. If you're worried that giving us a decent mana regen item would make us too powerful when we have C2 in a group, that can be worked around while still allowing us to have some solo mana regen. ]</i></font><br><br>When did we ever identify a need for casters to be more able to solo? That's not a problem that we intend to address. A lack of ability to solo is not an issue that needs to be addressed <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Fact is, our mana regen is not sufficient for soloing in the high levels. It is somewhat acceptable in groups w/ C2. Give us a mana regen item effect that stops working when grouped or something. Or give us mana regen items that don't stack (effect overwritten by chanter/bard) and have lower regen than a Clarity of appropriate level (say for a Fear item, give us 1/2 to 3/4 of C2). ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, we could create some sort of mana regeneration thing that only works when in groups. In fact, we already have. They are called bards and enchanters (and sometimes necromancers). Hey, that kinda rhymes&#8230; <br><br>Again, increased mana regeneration is not a specific solution for any problem with any caster class that we've identified. You haven't identified one here either, except an inability to solo (which is NOT an issue for many classes, since many casters can solo very well). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: While I'm on this hotbutton Wizard topic - Wizards all over would really appreciate it if you would give some very straightforward yes/no type answers to the following questions, to help them decide whether to delete their account now or not, so stop beating around the bush... ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not beating around any bushes. I'm telling you what I've told you before, until we're done balancing things there is nothing to tell. But I'll give you several probably and maybe answers, if that helps. Just remember that until all the class balance issues are done, NONE of this is a promise. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 1 - Will our mana regen improve? ]</i></font><br><br>Probably not. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2 - Will our dmg/time improve? ]</i></font><br><br>Probably not. Heck, wizards have a great damage over time ratio and this isn't even something that we're looking at improving. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3 - Will our dmg/mana improve? ]</i></font><br><br>Bane spells. Other than that, I don't know. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4 - Is our single most primary attribute now "Masters of Transportation" for balancing purposes? ]</i></font><br><br>Isn't now, hasn't been in the past, probably won't be in the future. Just because you are the 'best' at travel does not mean that travel is what you do best. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5 - If the above isn't a clear yes, is Damage considered the top priority for us, or at least even with transport? ]</i></font><br><br>There is no 'top priority' for any class. That's very misleading question. <br><br>Let's look at another class, to help keep perspective. <br><br>When talking about balancing, let's say, Magicians, yes, the first thing we'll probably look at will be their pets. But will that be the 'priority' for balancing that class? Who knows. What we'll do is look at everything that the class can do, find the holes, and see if we want to fill them. If we do, then yes, it's likely we'll again look at pets for filling those holes. <br><br>But you can't fill damage dealing holes with teleportation spells (in much the same way that you don't use a broad thing like mana regeneration to fill damage dealing holes). <br><br>For some reason people think that we are using the new teleportation spells to as a balancing tool, despite the fact that I've mentioned that these spells are going in as part of a long term plan unrelated to class balance. Yes, we're including them in the package that is the wizard when we look at the class as a whole, but it's pretty silly to even suggest that we would use a teleportation spell to help wizards sustain their damage potential against high hit point NPCs&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Thanks,<br>Cabot of Tholuxe Paells ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, that was of topic and I ranted a bit to boot.

What quest elements are good?<br><br>For example, I really got a kick out of the tax collection quest. I had already been an EverQuest veteran the first time I did it, and I knew Qeynos like the back of my hand. I had some trouble finding a few of the people to collect from, but for the most part it was a breeze.<br><br>But what I got a kick out of was the end of the quest, collecting the last bit of tax.<br><br>The trouble here is that I don't want to post spoilers. So you have two choices about answering this question. If you send me a bunch of spoilers, I'll just send them right to the team and we'll read them privately. If you can somehow write up your examples without spoilers (perhaps you're only talking about concepts, not specific quests), then I'll post it here (and send it to the team&#8230;).<br><br>So, what makes a great quest?<br><br>Alan</I></UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000166.html">Click here</a> to voice your opinion.

Geebus brings us the following announcement::<BLOCKQUOTE>I invite all yee that call themselves newbies to an event taking place on the Nameless server in the Qeynos Hills this Friday (5/11) at 7:00 PM PST. There have been reports of an evil baby dragon by the name of Geebus terrorizing the Qeynos area, and he has finally been driven into the hills. Though he poses less of a threat here, the mischevious scaled one has still been wreaking havock upon all passers-by, and his reign must be put to rest. Look for one Krintix to assist you in defeating this foe, as well as the wandering Holy Man, Gaian. There have been reports of a diralect Elemental by the name of Xrec, who is thought to be kind,and may also provide you with useful information and/or services. To he who defeats the baby dragon Geebus go the spoils. <br><br>/ooc . . . For this event, "newbies" are only considered to be those between the levels of five and ten. Assistance WILL BE GIVEN to the righteous. Among the prizes for the person who defeats Geebus will be: Various pieces of leather armor, a fine steel weapon, a split paw hide mask, and for the crowning prize will be an Icy Blade, a ranger only dagger, 6 damage, 21 delay, proccing a 38 damage DD at level 17. Fine prizes indeed. More may be given out from the wandering Holy Man, Gaian, the confused elemental, Xrec, and the bombastic alchemist, Krintix. It all depends on how creative you want to be. See you all there, newbies. <br> <br> <br>Signed:  <br>Geebus; Iksar ShadowKnight of the 11th level<br>Gaian Starwood; Human Druid of the 40th level<br>Krintix Xaneris; Iksar Shaman of the 39th level</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
