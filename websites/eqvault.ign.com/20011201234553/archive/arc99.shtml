Gordon responded to a few more board posts late this evening on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035935.html"><b>Veeshan's Peak</b></a><br>Just for a bit of clarification, back when the planes were brought online, John Smedley commented that people just don't die in planes, they die hard. Veeshan's Peak makes the planes look easy. There exists a non-negligible chance that not only will you die there, but you might not be able to raise the necessary forces to allow recovery of your corpse. It is *very* dangerous. <P>In order to avoid any appearance of impropriety in the zone, as sometimes follows when we've assisted in corpse recoveries in other zones due to claimed bug-deaths, we're not going to risk that for Veeshan's Peak. Veeshan's Peak is incredibly dangerous, and in order to guarantee that everyone is operating under the same set of conditions, we've elected to make the zone "enter at your own risk". <P>That said, there are no known bugs in the zone that would cause the death of a character, and it was tested extensively in the Ruins of Kunark beta. We will certainly investigate and eliminate any bugs that are reported, but we won't be reimbursing items or experience, nor will we be moving corpses or people within the zone.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036145.html"><b>Sharkjaw Baby</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: When I enable my Sharkjaw in my 2nd hand (warrior barb) it shrinks. It looks about 75% size. I looked at a friend and his ykesha was also shrunk in his 2nd hand ]</i><P>Thanks for the note, I'll pass the info on.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/034796-2.html"><b>More on Server Splits</b></a><br>We've postponed the server split for a bit as we didn't want to go taking down the servers for a while. When the split is being done, both the source and destination servers need to be offline. We'll probably do it by the end of this week.</UL>

Gordon has visited the Gameplay Board numerous times over the last 24 hours.  Here's the scoop on all of his latest:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036101.html"><b>Bard Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: There have been some excellent bard issue posts recently that (surprisingly to me) haven't included this issue. Still, this issue involves direct danger to bards, (unlike the issue of bards lacking a lvl 49 song), so perhaps it is better separated from such Abashi-ignorable discussion.]</i><P> It's looking at this time that there might not be a level 49 song. Geoff poured a bunch of good ideas into the 51+ songs. We would however be willing to entertain a discussion on this though.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036089.html"><b>Keeping Track of the Posts</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: One thing I think would help is a FAQ of your respones to the various game mechanics and class balance questions/rants. Recently I read your explanation of taunt on Castersrealm, if I hadn't of checked that site, I never would have seen it. I still don't know which thread you posted that response in.]</i><P> There's a couple of websites out there that do a pretty good job in cataloging our posts and maintaining a history. EQVault now provides a link to the original post with every quote, which makes it easier for people to come and commment. Some others are keeping ad hoc FAQs as well. <P>The reason that we don't want to do something official along these lines is that I'd hate to get into a situation where I'm constantly referring people to the FAQ. What I think would be helpful is if more people here would provide the information that they have knowledge of. I'd really like to see more of a community develop here. EQ Stratics has a good message board of this type. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036039.html"><b>Too Many Busy Signals on the Customer Support Lines</b></a><br>I agree, unfortunately phone lines and personnel are finite. There are just a bunch of people trying to get through to both places. This should clear up by the end of this week. We appreciate your patience.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036031.html"><b>Split Servers</b></a><br>The split process is a bit more complicated. Not only do we have to estimate the number of people on at peak, but we have to come up with a figure for how many people executing the /movelog command are actually peak players. That's why we open registration during peak hours, but it never stops a non-negligable percentage from off-peak from logging in to run the command. <P>It also doesn't take into account the number of people who have more than one account who'll run it for all of them. I know a few people who have upwards of 4 accounts, who only play one at a time. Of course I know two people who have 4 accounts and play all four at once too :)<P>There's a bit of trial and error involved. When we did the first split we took less people than we are taking with these. We now figure that we can safely move more people without risk of overcrowding the destination servers. We'll use data obtained in this process to further refine it for any future splits.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036005.html"><b>Alchemy Prices</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I am only 30 at alchemy, but have looked thorugh many of the potions. The only thing that I can make to sell so far is a SOW potion. No one wants to buy those stat potions that raise 2 stats 5 and drop one 5 for 10 to 12 plat. I noticed the regen potion will cost about 50pp to make. Don't think too many people will give me 75pp for 1 regen. Seems that alchemy could use a little revamping.]</i><P>We'll be able to start taking a look at these costs after things calm down a bit from the expansion rush. It sounds like some of the stuff is still a bit too expensive.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036021.html"><b>Questions about Iksar</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please let me know if Iskars not being able to wear plate armor is intended? What is the point of making an Iksar Warrior if I cant wear plate. Maybe they have an inate defense for AC, but most all the stat based armor that would benefit a warrior is plate based. Please shed some light on this.]</i><P> Please keep in mind that thousands of items have been put in along with the expansion. You shouldn't have a problem coming up with eqivalent armor sets for your Iksar. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Is there a place to read up on Iksar... what they can and cannot wear and why?]</i><P> You can get some information out of the History of Norrath section included in the manual that is available for download on the Kunark website at <a href="http://www.everquest.com/kunark.">http://www.everquest.com/kunark.</a> <P>As for why they can't wear plate, it chafes their scales :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035963.html"><b>Complement</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Wow. Hehe First of a hearty congratulations to Verant Inc for this incredible new expansion.]</i><P> Thanks. We're pleased with the comments that we've been hearing. It's nice to see people enjoying the new areas.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036026.html"><b>Iksar Sounds and Quality Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Is it against Verant policy to ship a finished product?]</i><P>EQ is not a single player game where development stops once it ships. It is continually changing and evolving, long after it ships. Since the focus of our company is on massively multiplayer games, they will all follow this philosophy. <P>As for sounds, we didn't feel that the issue merited postponing release for the odd sound or two. We'll have them in in the next week or two.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035817.html"><b>Monk Attacks - Iksar and Human Differences</b></a><br>The tail attack, called Tail Rake, replaces the Dragon Punch skill for Iksar Monks.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035788.html"><b>A Suggestion</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well why not an afk thing like this takes 30 seconds and then afk. Well thats not all it does once afk you cant move or do anything (cast, stand sit,) While Afk all Mobs will ignore you no matter what and you will be safe. Heres the point where someone (probably Abashi says) Someones gonna abuse it! But as stated above its just as though u camped out just u dont have to go through the log out log in process. This would make afk much safer and useful. Just an Idea )]</i><P> This wouldn't work well, as there is definite value to being able to see what is going on around you. This would essentially be a "personal pause" for the game, which doesn't go well with the idea of a massively multiplayer game. Now perhaps if we completely blanked the screen, disallowed chatting, and muted the speakers, and stopped healing and mana regen, it might be an option, but at that point we'd rather the person be out-of-game so that the servers don't have to track their status any longer.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035756.html"><b>Corpse Decay Information</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The .txt .doc and .html versions of the manual do not have the correct information about decay time on corpses. <P>Quoting from <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_guidefaq.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_guidefaq.html</a>  <P>Characters Level 6 and above: Corpse will disappear within 24 hours if the player is online (being at the Character Select screen STILL counts as online). Corpses will disappear within 1 week if the player is offline. Note: the amount of time you spend online, while a corpse is decaying, will be proportionally subtracted from the amount of offline time available. For example, if you are online for 12 of the 24 hours, your corpse will have 3 days and 12 hours of offline time (half of one week) available to it.]</i><P> Thanks, I'll double-check this and get whichever is wrong updated. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035713.html"><b>When Will the Store Return?</b></a><br>We'll be putting the store back up soon, we just want to make sure we get the current issues resolved before throwing any more orders into the system. It will probably be back up by the end of the week.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035710.html"><b>Hintpoint Modifiers</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi stated that Hybrids get an enchanced Hitpoint modifier. Well Rangers DONT]</i><P> I didn't say that you get it AT 51. Please read the post that I made today where I discussed how hitpoint modifiers work.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035711.html"><b>The K-Patch</b></a><br>The optional patch is used to patch new content that everyone will have access to. The "Kunark patch" button is used to patch content that only kunark-authorized players can access. The button that you press will depend on where the new zone is. For instance, when we launch The Hole, it will be patched via the optional patch. <P>You should K-patch regularly to insure you have the most up-to-date Kunark files. We'll also be requesting that you k-patch within the patch message from time to time.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035399.html"><b>Why is Verant Anti-Kiting?</b></a><br>We aren't anti-kite per se. We are however against situations where characters can reap rewards substantially in excess of the risk associated with them. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035433.html"><b>Kunark and EQ Keys</b></a><br>The upgrade key can only be used to upgrade. The retail key can be used to either create a new account OR upgrade an existing one.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/034375-3.html"><b>Top 10 Ways to Know it's 5AM</b></a><br>This thread is great! Here's a contribution from back when I was a guide: <P>271) You receive a petition: "Bob fell asleep 3 hours ago and we're getting kind of tired of protecting him. Can you kick him off or something?" <br>272) You receive a petition: "I fell asleep a while ago while bound in Cazic-Thule, and my group left. I lost over 15 levels. Can I get them back?"<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/027384-9.html"><b>Gordon on Wizard/Rogue Issues</b></a><br>I feel a bit bad for posting nearly the same response here as in a ranger and rogue thread today, but before we close this thread I did want to comment. <P>I've addressed a ton of wizard threads over the past several weeks, and it appears that we are at the point that we'll have to agree to disagree. We firmly belive that wizards are useful to and desired by the party, and as such are essentially well-balanced. There is no need for us to "fix" them as we do not feel that they are broken, even given the posts here on the board claiming such. <P>Like I said in the other threads, I'm sorry that this issue can't be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033934.html"><b>Bard Charm Bug</b></a><br>Yes, it appears that we introduced a bug last week that capped a bards attempts to charm at their level. This unintentionally affected the lower level charm song as well as the upper level. We'll be fixing this when we patch spells next. No other charm spells were affected.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033798.html"><b>Addressing Ranger Threads</b></a><br>Brad and I have addressed at least a dozen ranger threads over the past 3 weeks, if not more. We've said all that we can on the subject, that being that they are essentially well-balanced and as such we have no short term plans to "fix" them. <P>I understand that not everyone will agree with this and apologize that everyone can't be pleased in this matter.</UL>

Eldrad the General sends word of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>The first Raid on Monster Island I put together a while back went really well, where we went and killed the dino in OOT.<br><br>But there's a new Monster Island for us to raid, on Kunark in the Field of Bone. This island is the home of The Tangrin, a giant ape. This ape is rumored to con red at level 51, he hits for around 200 points, and drops "some kind of hairy armor". I dunno if anyone has killed him yet on our server but someone told me he went down on Fennin (but of course they could have been making it all up too :)<br><br>Anyway, I'd like to get some 50ish groups together to take him out. This will need the forces needed to take on a dragon, most likely, only without giants to kill along the way. If you'd like to come, email me at eldrad@tarewmarr.net or find me in game.<br><br>We'll do it this saturday (4/29) at 3 PM EST, meeting in the Field of Bone zone, at the ruined building right near the swamp zone (to the right when you enter the zone from the swamp).<br><br>To get to the field of bone, I only know the way from the Fironia Vie outpost... From the outpost, find the bridge that leads off the island it's on, go off this bridge perfectly straight, run all the way to the end of the zone (sow and invis will help so the spider people don't see ya). At the end of the zone when you hit the mountain/cliff, turn left and follow the hill. Eventually the grass will turn icky and you'll know you're near the swamp. Just keep following the zone edge hill till you get there... In the swamp, keep LEFT following the zone edge hill. SOW and Invis will be needed as you'll be running past an entrance to Calibis. You'll know you're there when you see the stone tiled floor, don't go near the entrance just run past it, keeping left the whole way. I didn't run into any trouble at all. Just keep left the whole way in the swamp and you'll get to the field of bone. Approx running time from the outpost to the Field of Bone should be around 20 minutes total, with SOW on.<br><br>I'd also like to humbily request that any of the big guild types, please don't kill this guy before us. Reason is, I'm planning the event and I'd hate to find out the hard way that he's a 1 week spawn or something :( You can come along if you want, whatever, but please let us have this first shot at taking down king kong :) Thanks in advance :)</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

A new story entitled <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid956784443,29977,">First Adventure to Kunark</a> was recently written by blah and posted in our <a href="/lore/stories">Fan Fiction</a> area.  Here's an excerpt:<UL><i>Impatiently we awaited the building of the outpost. During this time of construction, we sent our chief scout, Molan Toejam, to do some initial exploration of this land and bring us word of his discoveries. Many dangerous creatures he faced in bringing us this information, and bravely he fought on this new land as he explored its secrets. When our faithful druid finally made his way back to us it was with great gain, and with great loss. </i></UL>Enjoy!

As the online persistent world category continues to grow and evolve, one of the most exciting aspects to watch is the way each new project reveals different design ideas and influences.  For this reason, it can be pretty difficult knowing that a potentially exciting project is in progress, but still waiting patiently until its developer is ready to unveil it.  A bit earlier today, Wombat Games formally announced Dark Zion, a game we&#8217;ve been waiting to learn about for some time, and one that seems certain to attract considerable interest from the online gaming community.  <br><br>At a time when game makers with experience creating online worlds are at a premium, Wombat&#8217;s co-founders include Rick Delaschmit, former Lead Programmer of Ultima Online, and Jason Spangler who held the same position on the Ultima Online: The Second Age expansion.  In addition, the team&#8217;s Creative Consultant is the internationally acclaimed New York Times best-selling author Tad Williams.  <br><br>To bring the online gaming community the best possible coverage of this exciting new title, the IGN Vault Network announces the opening of our latest dedicated site, <a href="http://dzvault.ign.com/">Dark Zion Vault</a>.  And as the highlight of our launch, we are pleased to present the first-ever exclusive and very extensive interview with the game&#8217;s principals at Wombat Games.  Here&#8217;s a brief summary of the game to pique your interest: <blockquote> Dark Zion is a player-driven, player-controlled persistent online world.  Players will have an unprecedented level of control over their environment; beyond building a character, a player will have the opportunity to build a business, a town, an army, even an entire society.  There will be no arbitrary quests or super-imposed events; the story is the success or failure of the world at large. </blockquote> Other features at Dark Zion Vault will include game information, news, concept art, screenshots, humor, reader and community participation features, humor and much more.  New features and content will begin to appear in the very near future.<br><br>We invite all members of the community who are interested in the future of online gaming to stop in and check out the coming excitement from Wombat Games and best-selling author Tad Williams at our brand new Dark Zion Vault.  Enjoy!

Mandos  of the <a href="http://www.loreseekers.com/">Lore Seekers</a> sent a very intriguing report detailing information about mysterious teleporters that will deliever a player to one of Norrath's major cities.  Here is the report, you'll need to highlight it with your mouse cursor to view it as some might consider this a spoiler:<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="white"><i>Honorable Guildmaster Sorontar:<br><br>As a Wizard, I am professionally interested in all things having to do<br>with ethereal transport.  As such, I was drawn to rumors concerning<br>firepots throughout the lands of Norrath.  These rumors spoke of an<br>ancient transport system "for those of evil race", which could be<br>accessed through having the appropriate "key", and inserting it (or<br>using it) with the appropriate "firepot" in a Norrathian city, to be<br>instantly transported to another city of Norrath, without the need of<br>spell, Wizard or Druid (shudder!).<br><br>Knowing that most ancient magic was not related to the evils that plague<br>Norrath, I have long discounted the likelihood that such devices, if<br>they existed, were for evil races' exclusive use.  Evil races are prone<br>to destruction, rarely creativity of any sort!  However, it has come to<br>my attention, that such teleportation devices do, in fact exist, and can<br>be utilized by all races.  However, their utility is, at this stage of<br>my investigation, limited to travel from one hub point to twelve (12) of<br>the cities of Norrath.<br><br>This hub point is deep under the Timorous Deep, located at -12260,<br>+4365, -277.  It came to my attention, that the top of a classic Combine<br>Era Wizard Spire, with its familiar four tines, was observable above the<br>waves in this depth of Ocean.  If you swim down directly between the<br>four tines, you will find a square opening on the ocean floor.<br>Descending, you will find yourself suddenly in air, in a square room,<br>with three firepots along each wall.  In the center burns a magic fire<br>of blue, such as can be seen at certain ancient Elvish and Combine<br>towers (e.g. Oasis).  Note that the descent from the surface is one way,<br>and I was unable to find any way to leave the room by normal means.  No<br>monster nor person disturbed my researches that followed.<br><br>Binding myself to the locale, I commenced to mediate on the twelve<br>firepots. It was immediately apparent that the style of each was<br>different, and each was familiar to a particular culture of Norrath.  I<br>proceeded to test my hypothesis, and touching the rust-colored low<br>firepot, similar to many in the city of my youth, found myself, being<br>dusted off by a very surprised guard (my second cousin, twice removed),<br>in Northern Felwithe.  Without answering my startled cousin's queries<br>(he knows I tend to gate around hastily...), I immediately gated back.<br>I tested all twelve pots, and here is the key of their wisdom:<br><br>North Left:(fire on floor)Grobb (entrance)<br>North Center:(6 side gray)Ogguk  (entrance)<br>North Right:(6 side tall)Erudin (near dock)<br><br>East Left:(6 side gray)Neriak Commons (entrance)<br>East Center:(4 side wood)Greater Faydark (under Kelethin)<br>East Right:(6 side rust)Northern Felwithe (entrance)<br><br>South Left:(Brown box)Halas(near dock)<br>South Center:(Dark with blue)East Freeport (on dock)<br>South Right:(tall gold vase)Cabilis West (entrance)<br><br>West Left:(White marble)South Kaladim (entrance)<br>West Center:(Lava Lamp)Akannon (entrance)<br>West Right:(torch stand)Rivervale (entrance)<br><br>It is to be noted that "the Black Hole", Qeynos, and Highpass, are not<br>represented here.<br><br>An intriguing question, beyond the origin of these firepots and their<br>creator's identity, is: "Are there other pots out there that bring you<br>to The Timorous Deep?"<br><br>Respectfully submitted,<br><br>Mandos Turambar, Wizard Peregrinator of the 48th Degree<br>Treasurer of the First Chapterhouse of the Seekers of Lore (Tarew Marr)</i></font></BLOCKQUOTE>This is a very interesting addition to the world of Norrath.

Gordon Wrinn just posted the following post on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>There's a couple of issues that have several threads running behind them. It might be easier for me to address them at one time:<br>Spirit of Scale:<br><br>We'll be making this spell group-only (e.g. must be grouped with target) shortly. This should alleviate people's concerns about it being used offensivly to harm other players.<br><br>Backstabbing Pets:<br><br>Up until the level 50+ pet spells, all pets were based off of warriors. We now have the ability to base pets off of other classes, and that's what's been done here. There are now rogue pets, wizard pets, and monk pets, which represent additional abilities for the pet-users above 50th level.<br><br>Rogues need not worry that a backstabbing pet somehow reduces the desirability of their class. First, the pet does not have the backstab skill that a rogue of that level would have, so they won't hit as often nor will they do as much damage. Furthermore, they don't have all of the stat bonuses that increase the rogues effectiveness. Certainly they can be buffed up, but they'll never come close to having a real rogue. Finally, rogue pets will never have the ability to double-backstab as rogues do.<br><br>Rogue pets won't be picking locks either, and there are quite a few places to do that in Kunark.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Garr sends word of a festival:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings! I invite everyone of the light races to come to the Festival of <br>Kunark this Saturday, April 29th. The Festival will start at 6:00pm CST in <br>the city of Firiona Vie. This will be the biggest and most involving Festival <br>ever, and its to welcome the new land Kunark! There will be drinks and events <br>like:<br><br>--Dueling--<br>Have an old grudge against someone? Settle it at the Festival in one on one <br>combat!<br>Charge: Free (Duh)<br><br>--The Gauntlet--<br>Think your tough, eh? Well prove it and go through the Gauntlet. You will go <br>through a series of battles. After each battle you win you will recieve 1 <br>'Greater Heal' or 5 minutes to meditate, then the next opponent will attack. <br>Your final opponent will be your lvl or as close as we can get to it. Any <br>interference will not be tolerated and you will be killed on sight but a DoT <br>or pet to prevent faction loss.<br>Minimum level: 30<br>Entry fee: 10pp<br>Level 50+ entry fee: 20pp<br><br>--Defend your race! 4 on 4 combat--<br>This event will be race vs race. You can have 4 people in your team, no more, <br>no less and they must be the same race team as you ((EX:Barbarian, Human, <br>Human, Erudite is ok... Wood elf, High elf, Human, Barbarian isnt ok)). The <br>teams must be within the lvl ranges below.:<br><br>Level Range and entry fee<br>1-10: 5pp per person<br>11-20: 8pp per person<br>21-29: 10pp per person<br>30-35: 15pp per person<br>36-40: 20pp per person<br>41-49: 25pp per person<br>50+: 30pp per person<br><br>The winners of each division will get the entry money as a reward and an item <br>(Hopefully, just thought of this a few minutes ago so I will have to run <br>around the next few days getting this planned). TEAM LEADERS, E-mail me at <br><a href="mailto:LordKesmai@aol.com">LordKesmai@aol.com</a> with your WHOLE teams Level, Race, Class and names.<br><br>--Guildwar--<br>Think your guild is the toughest? Well you get a chance to prove it! This <br>event is strictly for fun and not a grudge match, unless you want it to be <br>::Snickers::. Execute the /guildwar command on a guild and the opposing guild <br>will accept. The two guilds will battle and the last standing from whichever <br>guild will be the victor. If you die once in the war you will not be allowed <br>to re-enter the battle. At the end of the war the guilds will execute the <br>/Guildpeace command and the prize will be given to the victors guild. Theres <br>no restriction on how many can enter the battle. Give it all you can! Your <br>fighting for your guild!<br>Entry fee: 50pp per guild<br><br>--Story Telling--<br>Listen and learn about People you know, legends, creatures. Listen to <br>character background stories like 'The Legend of Lord Garr Shadowbane'. If <br>you have any stories you would like to tell E-Mail me at LordKesmai@aol.com <br>with your story and you can tell it at the Festival!<br>Charge: Free<br><br>--Hide and Seek--<br>Well this pretty much explains itself. One person hides ((IN THE ZONE)) and <br>everyone tries to find him/her.

Gordon Wrinn was posting up a storm on the Gameplay Board.  Here's quotes and excerpts from his latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035607.html"><b>Questions about Disciplines</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1) why are most of the durations 9-18 seconds? ]</i><P>Disciplines without a downside have a short duration for balance reasons. Some of the warrior disciplines have upsides and downsides, and thus have a longer duration <P>Most of the short duration disciplins allow you to do something dramatic that drastically increases your effectiveness. The short period of time is necessary for balance. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 2) since the durations are so short why are the refresh times so long? ]</i><P>Balance again. Some of them are so powerful that we don't want them available constantly. <P><i>[Quote from original post: 3) why are all the disciplines on the same refresh timer? ]</i><P>See balance :)  Bascially /discipline is one ability, though there are different types of disciplines available. We basically didn't want a discipline to *always* be available.<P> <i>[Quote from original post: what range is the reduction in refresh time as a player advances in levels? 1%/level 5%/level 10%/level? ]</i><P>Generally 1 minute per level. <P><i>[Quote from original post: I'm just looking for some general answers. Originally I thought disciplines would be extremely powerful...but if a monk who uses Ashenhand can't use another discipline for 72 minutes...or a warrior who uses Mighty Blow can't use another for 60 minutes...UGH! Just would like to know why. ]</i><P>Though they aren't equivalent to LoH or Harm Touch, these are two very powerful disciplines that can be used for one encounter. Please remember that warriors, rogues, and monks are considered essentially well-balanced without these disciplines, and as such they are something extra. We have to be careful when giving extra abilities to insure that they don't "overpower" the class. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035598.html"><b>Why are are Enchanters 'Forced' to Solo to Level 29?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: why am i forced to solo to 29? yes you put in breeze but it is still useless]</i><P> Your argument appears to be based upon the assertion that Clarity is the only thing that makes an enchanter a worthwhile group member. In our opinion, this is certainly not the case. <P><i>[Quote from original post: so i cant get the spell. unless i want to pay 60p for a level 16 spell? ]</i><P>The spell just became obtainable yesterday. I'm sure the price will drop once supply catches up with demand. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035581.html"><b>Veeshan's Peak</b></a><br>Considering Veeshan's Peak, I'd like to explain something about this zone: It is designed to be the most difficult zone in the game, even more so than the Planes. As such, its rewards are much higher than other zones, but so are the risks.<P> We recommend that only the most advanced and organized players in the game even attempt to enter this zone. The customer service staff (GMs and Guides) will not assist players in any way in regards to this zone. This includes help for issues such as unrecoverable corpses (see your local Necromancer), or characters finding themselves stuck (see your local Magician), bugs, etc. The only assistance that will be offered by customer service reps in this zone are those covered by the Play Nice Policies. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035367-2.html"><b>Warrior HP at level 51</b></a><br>Number of hitpoints gained per level is assigned on the basis of race, class, and a multiplier based upon level. The multiplier increases in steps every X (where X is a value based upon race and class) levels. When someone hits a level where the value of X is increased above that of the previous level, the character will experience a HP "pop" over that that they usually receive. This in essence "makes up" for all the extra hitpoints they would have received if the multiplier was that way all along. <P>The Palys, SKs, and Bards all hit a step of that sort at 51, causing some of them to get upwards of 100 HP for the level. This doesn't mean that they are getting 100HP per level, just that for that level the number of hitpoints received "made up" for the hitpoints they would have gotten if the multiplier had always been at that level. <P>Warriors operate on a different schedule than SKs and Palys, but the curve will always favor them. For instance, warriors should see a fairly substantial hitpoint pop when they hit 54. <P>It's important to remember that 51 to 60 is not considered a "new" game. What I mean by this is that algorithms that take level into account and improve something every Y levels don't start over at 50+, they continue from where they left off. For instance, if someone has an attribute that improves in effectiveness every 4 levels, and his last improvement was at level 48, he won't see the next one until 52. This might make it appear that someone else who gets an improvement every 10 levels, and got their last improvement at 41, and gets their next one at 51 somehow gets something before the first guy. It's not the case, it's just the way that the math works. <P>I hope I haven't confused the issue further :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035591.html"><b>Hybrids in the Expansion</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Hybrids are what 60 percent warrior 40 percent druid,cleric, or necro? Yet all we get in expansion is spells that have been in the game for a while???]</i><P> You also get enhanced damage tables, higher skill caps, higher hitpoint multipliers, etc. But it is true that the only spells you get will be those of your parent class, and this has been a pillar of the class since the game was release with exception of the 49th level quest spells. <P>At 60th level, the Palys, rangers, and SKs, will all *melee* better than a 50th level warrior. You of course won't melee as well as a 60th level warrior, but that remains as designed. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035599.html"><b>Taunt Skill Issues</b></a><br>The skill level associated with taunt interacts with your level to determine how likely the taunt is to be successful. It does not control the level of success. A successful taunt will *always* make the creature shift to you, assuming that it can be taunted (Yes, some creatures are untauntable). <P>Taunt makes a creature hate you just a little bit more than it hates the next guy on the list. In other words, multiple successful taunts, or taunting a creature that is already attacking you doesn't do anything extra. <P>I hope that clears up how Taunt works.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035610.html"><b>Skill Cap Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: All of the new skill caps are still under what is acheivable by a level 50 character. So my question is do you need to buy Kunark in order to have higher skill caps?]</i><P> Skill cap changes are associated with level, and only affect the 50+ game. In other words, a warrior who maxes a skill out at 40 won't have a chance to raise it more until level 51. So, yes, you need to buy Kunark (and level above 50) to get an increase in your skill caps.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035645.html"><b>Wolf Form is KOS to Druids in Fironia Vie</b></a><br>The city governments have been enacting leash laws lately to try and curb the number of strays running wild through the cities. Wolves that aren't on leashes (e.g. a pet) will be attacked and killed on site by many of the guards. <P>That&#8217;s an RP reason anyway and I thought some might get a kick out of it :)<P>OOC: <P>Most NPCs were viewing a druid in wolf-form as a BetaNeutral NPC, instead of as a wolf. This was fixed a few weeks ago in many of the cities, and should have been in the patch message.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035641.html"><b>Pronouncing Kunark</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I-K-S-A-R (ick-sar) ]</i><P>On another note, just so everyone knows, Iksar is both singular and plural. For example: <P>The troll slaughtered a human.<br>The troll slaughtered 5 humans.<br>The troll was slaughtered by an Iksar.<br>The troll was slaughtered by 5 Iksar, but they really only needed one :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035312.html"><b>In Response to Recent Shipping Comment</b></a> (see below)<br><i>[Quote from original post: How far would that be Abashi?? Sent to Zomax? Already packaged and waiting on the Zomax shipping docks?]</i><P> "Too far" is "In Zomax&#8217;s queue for shipping today" as I understand it. Sorry for the confusion. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035217.html"><b>Range Attack Bug</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: With the creation of the new buttons on the Combat menu Splitting up Melee Attack into Melee 1 and Melee 2, and moving Range Attack to the next row, my Range Attack has disappeared.]</i><P>This is an art bug that was apparently introduced in the past day or so under the combat-skills menu. The buttons still function appropriately, its just that the names are being displayed improperly. The fix for this shouldn't take long.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035212.html"><b>The Scale Spells</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: From this day forth, anyone asking me for a SOW that I am not grouped with shall receive Tunare&#8217;s blessing of Scale Of Wolf. I strongly encourage all Druids and Shamans to follow my example until Tunare (a.k.a GZ) decides to fix this spell. <P>-Wolfen / 50 Druid - Druzzil Ro]</i><P>I think that this might be a good time to mention that the "Scale" spells are not upgrades to spirit of wolf. They are a spell of a different line that happens to have the same effect. The purpose of these spells is to allow faster travel in the huge Kunark zones. It is not meant to be the offensive spell that SoW has become.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/034588-5.html"><b>Why Isn't Karana Being Split?</b></a><br>Karana wasn't in the top four at time that decided what servers were to be split. I wish the situation was more complicated than that, but that's really all there is to it. Of the top 8 or so servers, most of them are hitting within 100 of each other at peak. It's not a large margin, but Karana (and the other servers that people have lodged complaints about) missed out by a few people. The cut off had to be placed somewhere, and I'm sorry that it couldn't please everyone.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035065.html"><b>An Age-restricted Server</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I think a server of 30-year old plus limits should be created. I know this is stereotyping the younger generation as a bunch of adolescent goofballs, but the majority of people that drive me crazy are under 20 years old. ]</i><P>It is very important to remember that age does not necessarily equal maturity, nor does it have anything to do with how people will act in an environment with a relatively high perception of anonymity. We hold everyone, regardless of age, up to the same standards of conduct in game. Though I do certainly sympathize with your desire to be free of those who are anti-social, that aspect of society will always exist in the massively multiplayer world regardless of the restrictions that we place on age.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/035196.html"><b>No Kunark Image</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone else try to create an Iskar charcter and not have it appear on the list as an active character ( no portrait). I installed the cd and nothing seemed to go wrong. Allowed the patches and can't find any reason why the character, which allows me to go through the creation process, does not appear.]</i><P> Did you remember to press the "Kunark Registration" button in the chat server and enter your new account key? Until you do that, you are not flagged as able to access Kunark content. Even people who haven't registered yet have the ability to see the Iksar in the character selection screen and can attempt to create one. We'll probably have a poppup box to suggest that people buy the expansion if they wish to do this put in soon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/034184.html"><b>Cancelling RoK Orders</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: According to FTC law Verant must supply a method for me to do this. Where is it? I have sent numerous emails all with no response. <P>My credit card has been billed for 80 dollars. Canadian. Don't mind the game being a little late but when I am billed for next day shipping I expect to get it. Especially when that charge is a $21USD difference. Sorry refunding one months play time (less then $9.95USD I subscribe to the 3 month at a time plan)doesn't make up for a $21USD overcharge.]</i><P> The cancellation option is for you to call Station customer service at 1-888-STATION. They have the ability to cancel assuming that the order hasn't gone too far in the system. <br>--<br>Those who wish to cancel their orders may do so by calling the Station (1-888-STATION). If the order hasn't gone too far through the system and shipping can be stopped, we will. <P>Again, we apologize for the shipping problems with the product and remind everyone that we've set up the kunarkrefund@verant.com email address to process shipping-cost refunds as well as credit those who meet the criteria specified in the patch message with a free month of EverQuest. </UL>

A player-written first impressions of Kunark was published a few minutes ago to our <a href="/lore/editorials">Editorial</a> section titled the <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid956694055,89604,">Pros and Cons of Kunark</a>.  Here's a snippet from this article:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>The partial reason for these horrid framerates is the trees. Yes, the trees. I know its nice and realistic that the trees sway in the wind, but as soon as you get more than 6 or 8 trees on screen at once, be prepared for slowdown. This is even worse in the Warsliks Woods and the Burning Woods where there are trees EVERYWHERE as far as the eye can see. The leaf covered branches are low to the ground so you can't see 10 feet in front of you. While this is good because it creates a real sense of danger, it is too much when you have 15 trees all intersecting each other and all swaying, all around you. If they include a switch to turn off the swaying trees then I think this would help greatly. In fact let my put it in bold for those of you who are just skimping through. INCLUDE A SWITCH TO TURN OFF THE SWAYING OF THE TREES. Needles to say, navigating the woods is not desirable at 15 fps as there are countless moving objects obstructing your view.</i></BLOCKQUOTE>Feel free to post your comments about this article.

Lordstyle sent me some interesting information about his call to Zomax this morning.  Here's his letter:<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, I just got off the phone with Zomax this morning, at 8:35am PST, and I found out <br>something interesting about the trouble that was being caused with the shipping.<br> <br>First, I would like to say that when I called, I was helped by a very friendly lady, who not only <br>found my order but even told me that it had been shipped and was due to arrive today.<br> <br>The problem that Zomax had, which seems to be confirmed by more then one person at Zomax, <br>is that they ended up with corrupt files and had to fill each persons order by hand, since the <br>computer that normally handled it had corrupt files. Thus, the long long delay in people getting <br>their game. As she explained it, having to fill out the order papers manually slowed the shipping <br>down a great deal. So I would tell all users out there to please hold on, they should be getting <br>them in the next day or two.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

I have never played an "anti PK" or played by any other gaming philosophy.<br>Many of my "crimes against humanity", mostly perpetrated in Ultima<br>Online, have been documented on the Internet (do a search for "WarChild of KoT" if you are interested). Most of these published experiences, although resulting in the other player's death, have been positive for all parties involved. </i></UL>As always, feel free to post your comments about this article.

Myrlynn sends word of a GM event on Solusek Ro:<BLOCKQUOTE>"Calling out to the power that be on Solusek Ro. Come forth with you <br>mighty guilds and compete for the destruction of Qeynos!" was broadcast <br>by Lady Daegarmo.<br><br>Quickly, and efficiently, the power of Paradigm raced to the fair city <br>of Qeynos to stake forth their claim as the most honorable Guild of <br>Norrath. Khengus Myrlynn, the esteemed Tracker stood first in the <br>majesty of Lady Daegarmo.<br><br>Five guilds arrived to do battle with the foul forces of North Qeynos <br>with only one be able to be crowned champion and be given their shot at <br>destroying all of South Qeynos. <br><br>The evil minions of North Qeynos were soon set upon by the forces of <br>Paradigm and their opponents. Led by the hoots and hollers of <br>Paradigm, Drakarr the Ungodly began to draw the lifeforce from the fould <br>citezens we were to slay. Behind him, the Heavenly powers of the <br>Priestess Tannis wrought the famed healing powers to keep them all <br>going. Pure Magiks were released upon our foes from the glittering <br>hands of Sorasil the Merciless as the harmonies ripped power throw the <br>lyranthe of the famed Aanani. Not to be outdone, Tallyn Masterougue <br>instilled terrors in the eyes of the enemy and unmercifully backstabbed <br>them with a laugh and an evil grin.<br><br>As North Qeynos was slowly brought to its knees, the Fiery Vengeance of <br>Paradigms Guildmaster Steiner Ewokbane brought down target after foul <br>target. Energizing the powers that be, swiftness and toughness were <br>dealt out by the members from the side. Excelander, Narg, Etal, Danmir, <br>Gukak and Keryl were there to make our fine attackers stronger and more <br>powerful. <br><br>Joining the Priestess in bringing forth energies from their gods, <br>Evldor, Skoal, Sarion and Dulfar brought glory to our name. Hurling <br>their bolts and comets from above our heads, Trinitos, Deramon, and <br>Yamdarr laughed maniacally as North Qeynos burst into Fire and Ice. <br>Holding the forefront were Balthek, Elcd, Maja, Katn, Grak, Kanos <br>Banekaos, Carlie, Shademehr, Sabretooth, Lulu, Sasprina. And of course, <br>the elusive and mysterious Druids of lore, Erico, Iisbliss and Phyndin.<br><br>As North Qeynos burnt to the ground, only one guild stood victorius. <br>Only one guild beat the test of time.<br><br>That guild was Paradigm and they were given the honor and glory for the <br>day.

After contacting Verant Interactive regarding the virus that was leaked to the EverQuest Patch Server this evening I received a response from Gordon Wrinn.  Here's the letter:<UL><I>It appears that we did patch two MS-Word '97 format Doc files that were infected with a relatively benign macro virus.  <br> <br>These viruses can only infect other files (and then only other Doc files) if they are opened in your word processor, so people who didn't open them prior to right now need not be alarmed.  We at Verant proactively work to eliminate the possibility that things such as this happen, however some safeguards were unintentionally bypassed as party of the Kunark opening.  We've closed this minor loophole and customers should not have to worry about anything such as this happening in the future.  <br> <br>We would like to extend our apologies to everyone on this matter.<br> <br> <br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Internet Relations Manager<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL><b>Update:</b> Gordon just send me the following update:<UL><i>It just occurred to me that I forgot to mention that the files on the Kunark Patch have been cleaned.  They will be replaced the next time everyone runs the "Kunark Patch" option on the patch server, and they should do so prior to attempting to open either of those *.DOC files.<br> <br>On another note, the PDF versions of the printed Ruins of Kunark manual are now available on the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark website at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/kunark/index1.jhtml">http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/kunark/index1.jhtml</a>.

It is empty save for a single torch, a pile of folded and newly cleaned armor and a quiet pool with a glassy surface. The silence and the mirror surface of the pool are broken at the same time by the naked figure of a woman. She looks about her and steps out of the pool to begin drying herself off. As she dons her armor somehing catches her eye. In the reflection of the pool she sees figures in the shadows behind her. She spins a sword with a glowing green stone in its pommel appearing in her hand. She looks into the empty shadows behind her and murmers under her breath. She knew she was safe here, even in that moment she did not feel in danger, she just reacted on what she saw rather than what she felt and that can be dangerous. The sword vanishing from her hand she sighs and finishes putting her armor on. Looking back into the pool she frowns, the figures are still there. Three reptilian men with their hands split and bound by brass. A soft voice fills her head and after a moment she realizes it is hers.*<br> <br>"The gresh maj are coming"</i> </UL><br><br>------------------<br><b>Valkryst Angelheart</b><br>Daughter of the Dawn<br>Defender of the Dawn</UL>Thanks!

Here's a clip containing minimal spoilers:<UL>Small but simple shuttles will convey you to a larger ship that sits on the other side of the zone line. As a side note, before you depart, be sure to actually register Kunark at the server select screen.

I'm being emailed left and right by people from across the net reporting that a virus has been discovered in eqrokmanualsupplement.doc and everquest_manual.doc.  The virus in question is a W97M.Class Virus, but thankfully isn't the most destructive of viruses.  Here's a clip from a letter Val sent me:<UL><I>W97M.Class<br><br>Common Polymorphic Word97 macro virus.  Some variants display insulting messages like telling user "is a jerk", etc. Some variants quietly do their infections on opening and closing documents.</i></UL>I just scanned my directory with McAfee and didn't detect a thing but the reports are so numerous I decided to report it just to make people aware.  I have contacted Verant and will hopefully receive a reply shortly.<br><br>For those who have it, the virus should be easily removed by upgrading your virus scanner's dat files and scanning your harddrive.

We wanted to give people the means to travel faster without that travel method turning into another offensive tactic. </i></b><br><br>Secondly, why does it overwrite SoW ? Verant doesn't need to stack actual spell effects to make them stack as being 'on' or 'off' - surely one spell can supercede in effect without overwriting<br><br><b><i>It overwrites SoW because it has the same effect and it does more to that effect. It's the way the spell hierarchy works. This really can't be changed.</b></i><br><br>Um, this has exploit written all over it. <br><br><b><i>We'll probably have to make the spell group-only in the near future. I'll send a note to GZ.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon announced that the Store Button found in the EverQuest client has been disabled.  Here's the post:<UL><i>The "Store" has been temporarily disabled while we look into the issues surrounding the shipping problems with the RoK expansion. I hope to have an ETA for when it will come back up to you tomorrow. In the mean time, anyone wishing to obtain Kunark access prior to the time that the Store is available again can seek the full boxed version out at your local game retailer.

Gordon talked about Zomax on a recent post to the Gameplay Board.  Here's the thread:<br><UL>Ever consider that Zomax is responsible for delivering the orders? Since Verant knows this, why should they care if Zomax can't deliver? <br><br><b><i>We certainly care. You are our customer, and we need to earn your business every month. If we can't do that, then we've failed you, and we're not willing to call it a day that easy.</b></i><br><br>Verrant do care since most people are not angry at zomax, they are angry at verrant<br><br><b><i>Which is why the concept of "fault" over this situation is moot. Regardless who is at "fault", we are responsible for satisfying our customers. Our customers asked us to deliver something to them, and some of them didn't get their product. That is the reason that we are extending the free month and refunding shipping costs.<br><br>We continue to hope that you'll choose to remain our customer.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

As I was going through the pages of the Gameplay Board, I stumbled upon the following thread:<UL>As sad as it is, this thought actually kept me awake for a bit last night.<br>I got my copy of the Kunark expansion on Friday. With said package, I receieved a small cloth map that shows all of Norrath.. so I decided to sit down and see if I had missed anything in the 9 months I've played the game. And yes, I have - a migrane. <br>Let's first start naming spots on the map that have not been added to the game (excluiding the Kunark continent, since none of us know about it yet.. or aren't bound by a legal issue). <br><br>Continent of Odus:<br>The Hole<br>The Barren Coast<br>The Vastly Deep<br>The Gulf of Uzun<br>The Irrand Plateau<br>The Stoneburn Mountains <br>Continent of Faydwer<br>Hills of Shade<br>Rantblock's Ridge<br>The Loping Plains<br>Wayunder's Lake<br>Elizerain Lake<br>Dragonscale Hills <br>Continent of Antonica<br>Rojarkan Hills<br>Broken Skull Rock<br>Gulf of Ganthrak<br>The Buried Sea<br>The Dead Hills<br>Unkempt Woods<br>The Serpent Spine Mountains<br>Lake Neriuss<br>The Northlands<br>The Hatchland<br>Everfrost Peaks *or* The Fridgid Plains <br><br>23 zones there that haven't been added to the game. Bad, bad Verant. <br>And now, for the major nitpicks. Let's see how all these zones are joined together, shall we? <br>Odus:<br>- Most of this contintent is ok. If they ever activate the deadzones there, might be a little confusing but otherwise ok. <br>Faydwer:<br>- Lesser Faydark. As it reads on the map, a traveler to here would first run into the LFay before they can enter the GFay. <br>- Elizerain Lake. You'd almost have to hit this non-active zone before you reach Steamfront. <br>Antonica: (ohhhh.. you're going to hate me)<br>- Deserts of Ro. And a river runs through it. Um, at least, it should. This same river should also pass through the Specter Island (which it doesn't) and then empty out into the OOT.<br>- Innothule Swamp. According to the map, it should be a horizontal (east to west) zone, but instead, it's a vertical one in the game itself.<br>- Lake Rathetear/Rathe Mountains. Ok folks, which comes frist. You're going through the Karanas to get to the lower zones. You hit South Karana, then zone into Lake Rathe. But check your map: according to it, the Mountains come first THEN the lake. <br>- Everfrost Peaks. Now, we have two options here, we can either say this is the zone we all call Everfrost or we can say that the Fridgid Plain is. The problem is, if you consider the Peaks the zone we call everfrost, then why is Halas offset to the *right* of the zone, when it's in actually at the *left*. Or, you can say that the Plains is the zones we call Everfrost but then you have to wonder how would one get that far East from near the Jaggedpine Forest. <br>- Everfrost again. Take a look.. looks like there should be a way to cross the frozen waste of this icy flatland into the less flat but just as wastish and certaintly much hotter Lavastorm Mountains. This would certaintly make alot of Barbies hapier if they had a shortcut back to their homeland from the rest of Norrath. <br>And that's everything I can think of so far. Ya, I'm crazy. But you gotta admit, you love it. <br><br><P><b><I>There certainly are. When the background for Norrath was being written, future expansions, zones, sequels, etc., were taken into account. In order to develop a solid foundation, you have set some boundaries for the majority of what will ever be in order to insure that your story is cohesive. This is a lot like the fantasy books that typically have a map printed within the forward. Most of the places on the map aren't visited in every book, but they are there for future volumes. <P><br>Another thing to keep in mind is that just because a name is on the map doesn't mean that every name on the map is a zone name. For instance, the map refers to the "Plains of Karana", while there are actually 4 zones that comprise those planes. The map also refers to Jagged Pine forest, which is really a *part* of Surefall Glade, which doesn't happen to be listed. <P><br>As for your comments on orientation, I'll buy it. It's not an exact replica, but it is very similar to the types of maps produced in our history when people were learning cartography. <P><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn elaborated on a newly discovered bug on the Kunark zone "Field of Bone" during a recent visit to the Gameplay Board.  Here's the thread:<br><UL>Here is the scenario: When I zone into the Field of Bone from the Iksar town, I cant see myself on the screen, I cant turn, cant change my view. If I taunt a mob or check my inventory, the game crashes to my desktop. Other players say I am crouching... I hit D to uncrouch and still the same problem. If I attack, it says im sitting. So I<br>stand and the problem still persists.  I reinstalled my drivers.. went and downloaded the most current drivers according to the manufacturer and Verant, and reinstalled Directx7. I tried both the dx7 and glide versions for my Voodoo2 card and still no fix. I cant use my primary video driver at all (Rage Fury) so I didnt even bother with that. I have always used the v2 for EQ.<br><br>Finally I gave up, deleted the character, started anew and searched for other newbie zones... I found one. So I start hunting there, and finally die... and sure as #&$@ the bind point is in Field of Bones So now im stuck again<br><br><b><i>We've received the reports of this issue. It's being caused by a problem with one of the Field of bone files in your EverQuest directory. For some reason the patch server isn't detecting the problem and repatching it. We're not sure which file it is yet, as all of our systems here are working fine, but when we do find out we'll let you know right away.<br>If anyone who's having this problem would care to assist, you can try deleting one of the field of bone files, repatching, then seeing if it works. If it doesn't, delete another and repeat. We don't want to recommend that everyone delete all of the files as they total over 9MB.<br><br>As soon as we get it narrowed down, we'll let you know and also fix the patch server.</b></i></UL>
