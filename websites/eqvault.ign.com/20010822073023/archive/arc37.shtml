This is today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034896.html"><b>How do you say...</b></a><br>Actually it's: <br><br>Key-nose (like dose)<br>Hul-las' (like Las Vegas)<br>Cahzick Thoole (like tool with a Th)<br>In-no-rook (like rook in chess)<br>Nah'-jen-uh (uh like bunk)<br>Zegony<br>Tair-ewww Marr<br>Sorry-ren<br>Thol-uxe (Doll bucks) Paells (Pails)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034914.html"><b>The Vision</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: . yet in the last patch this is what was changed, lowered spawn rates and overall less mobs in the game, less exp per kill on same mobs, more exp loss on death, less loot.]</i></font> <br><br>While it is possible that some isolated individual spawns might have had their rates (spawn or loot) adjusted in one direction or another: <br><br>- No move was made to lower spawn rates across the board leading to less mobs in the game. <br><br>- No change was made to reduce the amount of experience earned per kill on those mobs. It's always been based on the level of the NPC and the zone you are in. <br><br>- No change was made to make people lose more experience on death. The only change to this that has occurred since release was when it was halved. <br><br>- No change was made to reduce the amount of loot entering the world on a global scale. <br><br>Now in regards to your suggestions regarding level based equipment, it was decided some time ago that EQ would not take that route. The FAQ has a pretty good explanation regarding this suggestion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BTW this was not a bash or flame, I am just concerend, I've been playing EQ for erm what 3 years now, and this latest move SCARES me.]</i></font> <br><br>Well two and a half years at most if you were in the earliest beta phase, but I don't believe that the "latest move" that you spoke of above occurred.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034913.html"><b>Necro & Magician Damge Rates Against Green Frog</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What is wrong with this picture:<br>he never ran out of mana...<br>he resisted unresistable spells...<br>he never got hurt even with 2 50+ pets wailing on him due to lifetap...]</i></font> <br><br>Nothing really. He's not an NPC that we want to be killed. As for the "unresistable" spells, there are only a couple of truly unresistable spells in game, and they all belong to NPCs.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034727.html"><b>Patch Problems</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Still can't activate spells with the control key, like you could before the patch (<ctrl> + <number 1-8> )]</i></font> <br><br>The default key was changed to ALT. You can check it back to CTRL if you like by going into Options/Keyboard. <br><br><br>2. I've never heard of that one. It sounds like a problem with your video card or driver, perhaps the way it's handling mipmapping. Have you tried turning off mipmapping to see what happens? <br><br>3. The spell line eats mana gradually. When you ran out of mana it didn't wear off. It was a bug fix. Should it have been reported? Certainly, but it's still a bug fix.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034702.html"><b>Witch Hunts</b></a><br>I'm unaware of any case where someone found a ban to be "probably mistaken" yet did not reverse it. That just wouldn't be right. If you have a URL where I could direct customer service, that would be appreciated.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034713.html"><b>Questions for the "New Abashi"</b></a><br>Well if you'll take answers from the "Old Abashi", I'll be happy to take a shot: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. "Oh yeah, one more thing. Why doesnt EQ put the maps of the citys in there guide when you buy the game??"]</i></font> <br><br>There are indeed maps of the playable cities in the manual released with the Kunark full-retail box, which I believe is the only thing on the shelves these days. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. "Its been 2 years and they still havn't made the game compatible with most sound cards (promissed June, '98 that there would be a new sound engine VERY Shortly, September '00 still no engine)" ]</i></font><br><br>First, the game never had a problem with "most" sound cards as suggested. Some people running under certain configurations (with the SBLive for instance) had problems, where as others had no problems of that nature though they used the same card. The vast majority of people (including myself on my home system which included an SBLive) never had any problems. <br><br>As to the new sound engine, it's in. It went in the same time as the DX7 update. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. On the new expansion coming out "Still havnt fixed some bugs from beta.. "]</i></font> <br><br>It wouldn't be proper to comment without a specific list of "bugs from beta" to know what you are getting at. Most issues that exist and have existed for that period of time are not bugs, but rather a waived design issues that will never be addressed due to various technology limitations (download size being chief among them). They are part of the game now, and we'll have to live with them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. "I love EQ so don't get me wrong. I play AC also and, I have to admit, am wondering why AC makes upgrades and increases land/monsters/spells/items/etc etc, for FREE and EQ makes you pay for them? Just wondering..." ]</i></font><br><br>They have their business plan and we have ours. We've added tons of new content (quests, items, spells, even zones) for "free" as well. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034717.html"><b>The Point of AFK</b></a><br>Sinneed's response was pretty concise. <br><br>Basically, there's no "pause" button in a persistant world, at least not ours. The only way we would implement a "safe AFK" would be if there was absolutely no in-game benefit to using it. That means that we'd have to make you blind and deaf as well as stopping any type of regeneration and skill-use countdowns. <br><br>At that rate, the question indeed becomes, why not just log off?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034469.html"><b>Magical Damage</b></a><br>This keeps coming up as an example, though I've addressed it before. <br><br>What does "magical damage" mean to you? To you does that mean that any spell that does damage available to a wizard of a certain level should do more damage than any other spell available to any other class of a particular level? <br><br>If so, that's not the definition we use. Our definition is damage over a time period. A DOT that does more damage overall than ICE comet does not do it in the short period of time like Ice Comet. Of those two spells you mentioned, one wizard and one mage, the wizard spell is faster and more mana efficient. <br><br>Wizard spells across the board have usually have either better casting times, better mana ratios, do more damage, or a combination of the three than those of any other class (harmtouch excluded) ***over a period of time***. That's how it works, and wizards fit that definition. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034695.html"><b>More Druid Forms Needed?</b></a><br>"Require" is a pretty strong word. While I understand that you *want* more forms, I don't think that they are required. As such, it's certainly good content for the wish-list, but it's not something that I can say we will or will not do at some point in the future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034622.html"><b>NPC Named "!"</b></a><br>The exclaimation point is indicative of an NPC that has been "permakilled", which usually happens when a problem is found after the live servers come up that is severe enough to justify removing the NPC from the game until they can be patched. <br><br>There are a few other problems which can cause them to pop up unintentionally, requiring a patch to fix them. Often, if it is a critical NPC, we'll patch the zone without taking the servers down to clear up the problem.</UL>

Here's a couple of posts recently made by Alan on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888.html"><b>Shaman Issues</b></a><br>Rorgg said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Admit the spell had its intended functionality before. Your statement made it sound like the way the Rage series has been operating was due to a bug. That's not true and I think everyone knows it. The Rage series spells were designed with the full knowledge that draining empty mana would not cancel them, that was part of the design.]</i></font> <br><br>It was working that way due to a bug. But it was also working pretty much as intended. The two are not exclusive ideas. The bug is fixed. Now we need to fix the "as intended part". <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Admit the mechanics changed for a new spell line and VI did not anticipate the effects of changing the mechanic (which is obvious from Torpor). Promise us better QC in these regards.]</i></font> <br><br>I have admitted that it was changed to make it so that spells that use mana continuously couldn't use mana that didn't exist (I will neither confirm nor deny anything about any new spell lines). We're not hiding it. And we did not anticipate this particular effect to occur with the change in the mechanic. I won't promise better quality control in the future. I will promise that we will work on having better quality control in the future (a subtle difference. The trick here is that if our quality control improves, most people would never notice. You can't see all the problems that we catch, only the ones we don&#8217;t). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Do NOT leave us with a gimped replacement or no fix. ]</i></font><br><br>I have no intention of that. I'd like to see the spell working mostly as it was. But this is also a chance for the community to voice its opinions on this particular spell, at a time when we know we have to change it. Let's keep this thread to that purpose. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Above all, do NOT flee the thread. The more you talk to us, the calmer we are. The thing we're most afraid of is being left with no replacement, like the other two times this has happened. ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not going anywhere. It's my job to stay here and talk. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. Go /bonk the live team. They deserve it. ]</i></font><br><br>Not really. There are a LOT of spells and spell effects in EverQuest. Missing one on a change like that (of the many changes that are made) isn't too bad. Besides, some of these guys are a lot stronger and tougher than I am&#8230; <br><br>Please, let's keep this thread to the topic at hand. Yelling at me about pets or other issues dilutes the ideas that we are looking for here. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034748.html"><b>Mage Bug with Pets</b></a><br>Thanks for the info.

Brian Hook, one of the most recognizable people in the gaming industry, resigned from his post at Verant Interactive yesterday.  The guys at Voodoo Extreme caught up with Brian today to <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/games/interviews/hook/">get the full story behind his depature</a>.  Here's a snippet:<UL><b>VoodooExtreme: Why did you leave Verant?</b><br><br>Brian Hook: First, let me state up front that this was a completely amicable departure.  Verant was very good to me.  Smed [John Smedley, Verant/SOE Executive VP] and I have a good rapport, and he&#8217;s a genuinely good guy that I like a lot.<br><br>But to answer your question, I was just getting uncomfortable with the very corporate environment there.  You have to understand my background  I left 3Dfx when it had less than 50 employees; when I worked for Silicon Graphics I was just a contractor, so I never had to deal with &#8220;big company&#8221; issues; and at id there were about a dozen employees.  So I come from a very small company mentality.  When I went to Verant it felt absolutely huge  I think there were about 70 or so employees, but I don&#8217;t quite remember  but after the acquisition by Sony it got even huger.  All of a sudden I was working for this gigantic company based out of Japan instead of a relatively small game developer, and that just wasn&#8217;t as enjoyable for me.  This isn&#8217;t a slam on Sony, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m a lot more comfortable working with a small group of people without a lot of corporate &#8220;stuff&#8221; to deal with. </UL>Thanks Steph!

I will be hosting an all night kegger <br>Sunday, The 17th of December, to Kick off the season right!  I would have <br>been holding this party at the city of Kelethin, but that idea for last <br>year's party ended in disaster with the 'accidental' deaths of about 6 <br>newbies, and several higher level characters all demanding Ressurections.<br> <br> It was in all, a funny night, but not good for my pocket book.  Therefore, this year, the party will be held in the Laggiest Zone in the World!  Thats right! East Commonlands!  Festivities will start at about 7:00pm PST, and end at about 8:30pm PST.  This year, we will conclude with the famous, Drunken Deathmatches!  I invite all Norrathians to join me in at this party which will be held in the honor of the Guild Leader Arideth of the Order of the Iron Hand!  Bring friends, booze (it will be provided for, but I cannot guarantee for how long), women (no offense), and have a merry old time! <br><br>Krydin Spiritwalker <br>Druid of the 39th Circle <br>Order of the Iron Hand </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

A spell should not be powered by mana that does not exist. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Make it so that rage does not drain mana at all.

Perhaps give it a fixed duration with no mana drain and still the loss of any other spell casting (that seems to be the key part of the restriction on the spell anyhow). We may need to increase the casting cost&#8230; <br><br>Again, I'm just speculatin', and nothing I say here has any official backing, I just want to talk possible changes&#8230; :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034645.html"><b>Downtime Reminder</b></a><br>Just for your information, here's the information from our scheduled downtime site: <br><br>Scheduled Downtime Nov. 29th All Servers.

A lengthy post was made in response by Gordon to a thread entitled "<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034311.html">Verant vs. Players</a>" found on the Gameplay Board.<UL>This is the retail version of EQ, the classes and races should have been balanced before you released it. <br><br><b><I>That's easy to say, and for the most part it was true. However we *have* been adding content to the game with every patch, including tons of new zones that over doubled the worlds size since release. Every time we add something, we run the risk of creating an imbalance that needs to be addressed, or else we have a broken game that people will not play. Make no mistake: People will not play a broken game. <br><br></b></i>All the patches should only be adding content and bug fixes, not plugging up ingenious strategies which the players found and which you didn't think of. <br><br><b><I>It goes without saying that 300K people can discover strategies that weren't found by the 40K or so that were in all phases of the beta, and the 2000 people that were in for all but the last month of beta. Additionally, many of these "ingenious strategies" that you speak of were created by us attempting to add more content by way of items, quests, abilites, etc., to the game. <br><br></b></i>We players are not here to find crack's in the design of EQ for you. <br><br><b><I>No, you are here to have fun. However that aside, you will still find cracks in the design of EQ for us throughout that process. I'm thankful we have a dev team working to address those cracks as they are discovered, or again we'd have a broken game. <br><br></b></i>If you truely don't like how we players play this game, or the strategies we come up with, then keep them in mind for when your designing EQ2, but dont punish us here and now. <br><br><b><I>Again you seem to be saying that it would be better to leave gross imbalances in game that cause people to leave rather than correct them. I have to respectfully disagree, and say with some authority that this will not be the case with any game we make. These games are designed to last in the marketplace for a number of years, and need to last that long to cover development costs, both past and present. If they do not draw enough subscribers or last long enough, the game fails and future development is hurt by it. We won't sit around and watch a game fail when we can do something about it. Now EQ was never in jeopardy of that because we've always addressed these problems as they came up, but if we left every problem, or tried to address them all in a "positive" manner by increasing the power of "A" through "Y" because Z is overpowered, it would not be long before everything in game was elavated to broken proportions. <br><br></b></i>Maybe you should realize that this game you created has taken on a life of its own when boxed it and sold it. <br><br><b><I>Actually it took on a life of its own over a year before release when the community was formed by people interested in the game. As with anything alive though, things are in a constant state of flux. Things change, and we have to change with them to be sure that everything stays in line. <br><br></b></i>thats exactly my point. Don't do anything. So what if warriors found a way to solo blues up to 60. So what if every other warrior is doing it 3 weeks later. How does it hurt anyone? <br><br><b><I>So what if all classes found a way to do it? Should we leave it then? Suddenly you have everyone in the game running around without a need to group. Classes become meaningless as one class can do pretty much anything that the next class can. Class A is no longer dependant on class B for good or services in order to advance. That alone would reduce the social impact of the game by making it unnecessary for people to meet each other. Suddenly we'd have 300K people playing a single person game on our servers, with nothing really to hold them together. Aside from the hardcore players, the game would be dead within 6 months. </b></i><br><br>Always ADD never TAKE away because when you take away (nerf) you punish. <br><br><b><I>And *never* make a policy absolute, with exception to the policy of *never* making a policy absolute. Once you completely block out a particular course of action you limit yourself for no good reason other than it being "policy". <br><br>As mentioned above, the policy of buffing up A-Y every time Z is overpowered is not at all suited to this environment. We would be constantly increasing every classes abilities, or the power of their spells or items, because of "inequities" cited by one class or another. <br><br>Can we agree that as long as we have a class-based system, where classes have complimentary strengths and weaknesses, that there will always be people who believe that the strengths are not strong enough and that the weaknesses are too severe? </b></i><br><br>If Verant really does really not like this new strategy, then they should tip their hat to the player who discovered it, and remember to make that strategy impossible in some future EQ game. <br><br><b><I>That's certainly the policy advocated by the ever-quoted "mudwimping" article, an article that I personally disagree with. As I mentioned above, absolutes are dangerous. Completely ruling out one reasonable course of action and exclusively increasing power or abilities of the game as a whole is a BAD thing to do. It's as bad as exclusively decreasing power or abilities. Neither is an appropriate course of action. That article gets a lot of mention because it suggests a course of action that is popular with socieity: more, more, more, never less. <br><br>There's a quote that suits this situation quite well, so I'll paraphrase: What is right is not always popular, and what is popular is not always right. It basically speaks to the fact that people do not always make the choices that are best for them. I'm sure that we could adopt the suggestions in the mudwimping article and please a lot of people in the short run, but as soon as something came up that completely unbalanced the game, invalidating a class or two, and we decided to leave things as is or enter the "enhancement death spiral", there would be no peace. <br><br>Let me string a series of analogies together. I'm sure they all have their flaws, but I think that the point is sound. Imagine if: <br><br>- banks have a policy of *always* taking the customers word for it in a disputed account.<br>- paying taxes was voluntary (some argue that it is, but still)<br>- we released all of the "innocent" people from jail.<br>- *everyone* has a college degree<br>- *everyone* has at least a million dollars <br><br>These are situations that are pleasing and popular to those who are to be affected, but what happens when they are applied to everyone across the boards? Would any of this be right? Yes, if *I* have a problem at the bank I'd like to know that they'd just take *my* word for it. Yes, *I'd* like paying taxes to be voluntary for *me*. Yes, if *I* was in jail, I know *I'd* be innocent of any crime that would put *me* there so *I'd* like to be released. Yes, *I'd* like to have a college degree. Yes, *I* would like a million bucks. <br><br>But everyone?! NO. *I* can vouch for what is good for *me*, but I know that it's not good for global policy. No, I wouldn't like the idea of banks taking everyone's word for it, as I know that fraud would increase to the point of critical failure and that the entire economy would collapse. No, I wouldn't want paying taxes to be voluntary, because then very few would, government programs would fail, we'd have no standing army, and the government would collapse. No, I wouldn't like everyone who say's that they are innocent to be released from jail. That's why we have a court system. No, I wouldn't want *everyone* to have a college degree, because then a college degree would be meaningless. No, I wouldn't want everyone to have a million bucks, because inflation would run out of control, milk and bread would cost thousands of dollars per unit, and the money would all be in the hands of the top 1% within a month anyway, putting them that much further out of *my* reach. <br><br>One final analogy that fits better than the rest. Imagine if: <br><br>- we increased the power of a class/item/ability, etc., every time "enough" (whatever that means) people complained.</b></i> <br><br>So to answer your question, Verant should only add content, or leave things as they are. <br>Koen <br><br><b><I>Well, while I appreciate your ability to state your opinion in a manner that is appropriate for this forum, I must respectfully disagree with the points that you've made.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Alan made a few posts today on the official Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/032418-4.html"><b>Big Thread on Mage Problems</b></a><br>Well, I don't think I'll be able to answer most of these to your satisfaction, but I'm willing to try. I'll tell you now that a post this long is going to be hard to answer, and I don't have all the answers to anyone's problems. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Since the last patch, it has been speculated that the proc rate on sword of runes has decreased.]</i></font> <br><br>I think, by now, you all know the answer to this one. The proc rate on all pet weapons has been reduced to be the same as any player character with the same dexterity. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>It has been speculated that CotH has been altered such that it's chance of clearing aggro has been greatly reduced. It has also been altered so that CoHing a pet caster does not cause his pet to suicide.]</i></font><br><br>Here's what I know. Call of the Hero will probably never always clear the hate list. And we haven't changed anything (that we know of) that reduced the chance that it would clear the hate list. But we have a possible fix ready to be patched that might increase the chance of the hate list being cleared. The same goes for the pet suicide thing, we should have a fix for that in the next patch. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  VELIOUS SPELLS]</i></font><br><br>I'm not discussing Scars of Velious spells. But I'm not going to discourage you from talking about them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Linkdeath. Mages suffer from this more than any other class, since our startup summoning routines (depending upon the situation) can consume anywhere from 2 bubbles to our full mana bar.]</i></font> <br><br>Always been that way, since day one. This is one of the drawback of magehood. We just can't program around accidental link death, we can't tell it from purposeful linkdeath. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Post-50 pet upgrades.]</i></font><br><br>Well, this one baffles me a bit. I, frankly, don't know enough about high level pets. All I can tell you is that I'll look at it and ask questions. But, by way of warning, understand that nobody was promised that they would become super powerful post-50&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Post-50 fire pet.]</i></font><br><br>Again, I dunno. I'll look at it, with the same caveat as the last one. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Deafening Decoy. This pet is not a decoy. Its taunt is ineffective.]</i></font> <br><br>This one is new to me. You should explain this in depth, especially if you want this to be the defining thread on the mage class. I understood the previous two because I had read them elsewhere, but this one is out of left-field for me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  they begin to hit the pet's controller THROUGH the mob, regardless of distance. These hits seem to be based on the controller's AC (all I know is that I am always hit for full). Please fix this bug, Verant, so that I can get rid of my eboots =) Maybe then we can look at the Decoy.]</i></font><br><br>I thought this bug was fixed. It's been a while since I've seen it. I'll ask about it. If you can tell me how to reproduce this bug, we'll gladly find it and squash it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Post-50 spells in general. Mage summons are largely junk. Our spell lines see only minor upgrades in RoK, certainly not in keeping with mob increases.]</i></font><br><br>Well, one man's junk&#8230; <br><br>But if I were to run out and stealth add some interesting but not powerful summons for you, would that be enough? Summons have never really been intended to add to the power of the class, only to its utility (with some notable exceptions). New summons would fall along the same lines. Again, I can't talk about Scars of Velious spells. But I will keep this request in mind if/when we start to look at new spells for magicians. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Mages have no defensive spells: no root, snare, sow, harmshield, shadowstep, crowd control, etc. We are, in effect, the most limited casting class in the game. ]</i></font><br><br>My Take:<br>So what? I am fine in my role, and so long as I am not crippled in my offensive capabilities, I could care less about defense. It's called a drawback, and all classes should have them. What causes people to clamor for these abilities is that our offensive capabilities suffer post-50. Fix our pets and summons in the late game and these complaints will fade away.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok. Because it's highly unlikely that magicians will get things like snare, root or sow. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Mages have minimal group utility. <br><br>My Take:<br>A Mage's major contribution to a group is his pure offensive power. That power has decreased relative to other classes post-50, certainly; however, Mages remain powerful, and I think that the majority of problems that Mages face in groups are because other players do not recognize this. There are legitimate problems: zones where pets are unwanted, for instance, and against Uber Mobs, where Mages are wholly ineffectual. I personally would like to see some group-specific capabilities given to Mages, in return for our soloing ability being crippled post-50. However, this is not a huge priority, and could easily be fixed by addressing the issues with our late game pets and summons. CotH was a good start. (Thanks, Verant.)]</i></font><br><br>You're now getting into seriously overlapping your requests. This, again, seems like a request to up the power of your post 50 pets and your summons and these complaints will fade away. Let's not dilute the discussion by adding things that you don't really need. And you are telling me here that magicians are very powerful pre-50 and acceptably powerful post 50, but that other players just don't know this. Part of the problem with your initial post was: IT'S TOO DARN LONG (and, therefore so is my response). You've included a lot of info, and that's great. But you're asking me to read and comprehend four pages (when pasted into Word) of magician specific stuff, some of which are repeated requests for the same thing&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Mage-specific loot in RoK is sparse, and what does exist is fairly subpar, compared to both existing Mage gear and what other classes get.]</i></font> <br><br>Again, I dunno. I'll take your word for it. I also can't tell you what is or is not in Velious. How about we hold off until we see if this is addressed in Velious? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>The Mage epic quest requires clearing the 7th island of sky. <br><br>My Take:<br>I disagree that this is a problem. These quests were intended to be completed by guilds, not individuals. The difficulty of epic quests is not determined by the difficulty of the mobs involved. That is, in fact, irrelevant (provided that they are killable). It is determined by access to the mobs and the frequency of the drops.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, so we can take this one off the list, since I agree with you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>We require a rare drop off a roaming mid-level rare spawn in a fairly low-level zone. Getting this item can take weeks or months.]</i></font> <br><br>If this is the Pegasus Cloak, there are other ways to get it&#8230; it's not no-drop, is it? So buy the thing. It's been dropping since about the time the game opened, there are plenty of them on the servers&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>We require a rare drop off a seven day spawn that is highly contested. Based on the number of these items on various servers, it seems that it is a 1/30 drop.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, again, I have to guess that you are talking about the staff. And again, this item has been dropping for a while. They can be gained. I'm not saying this is easy. But the reward is worth it. And there is a bit of exaggeration in your time estimations&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Before the recent patch, the Elemental Binder was not dropping. Now it is. Burning Embers and Dirt of Underfoot have still not been found.]</i></font><br><br>The drop rate on the Binder was indeed increased, at the request of the players. IT WAS NOT BROKEN. It just was a rare drop. It isn't so rare now. The Dirt has been found, we did nothing to its drop rate. The Embers will be found. Once again; tough to get, worth the effort. <br><br>In any case, I wanted you to be aware that I do read these things. I just don't like to post incomplete answers like these. <br><br>I think I'll go back to my vacation&#8230; I still need to see Unbreakable. I'll be back to read this thread again on Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034032.html"><b>More Pet Issues</b></a><br>No, we don't plan to remove weapon use from pet. <br><br>Please, next time ask this kind of question in an already existing thread.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033968.html"><b>On Rogue Skills</b></a><br>You're not going to like this, but... <br><br>It's working as intended. <br><br>This was done intentionally, there was no programming error here.</UL>

Abashi stopped by the Gameplay Board today to make <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034160.html">the following announcement</a>:<UL><I>Some people have been reporting that their screen freezes every so often while in game, causing all sorts of mischief. While we are looking into that problem, and do have some changes planned for the next patch that should reduce its occurance, there are some things that you can do first to see if it improves:<br><br>1. Virus scan software: These problems usually run in a systray (down by the clock). By default, they typically are set to scan files every time they are accessed. This could be causing some of those problems, as EverQuest accesses several local files at every character save. Try disabling it to see if your situation improves.<br><br>2. IRQs. PCI devices are designed so that they can share IRQs. That works well in principle, but can cause problems when several high bus-bandwidth devices are on the same IRQ. Typically we've seen this when sound and video cards are on the same IRQ. You can try disabling your sound by placing a file called "NOSOUND.TXT" (file contents do not matter) in your EverQuest directory. If your freezing goes away, there is a good chance it's a shared IRQ problem. The method by which to reassign IRQs varies from system to system, but can be done by either moving the sound card to a different slot, manually assigning IRQs in the BIOS, or manually assigning them in the Device Manager. You probably shouldn't attempt any of these without the assistance of your local computer guru, unless of course you are the local guru.<br><br>As mentioned above, we are putting in some changes in next week's patch that should help the situation for those that aren't affected by #1 or #2, but you'll want to make sure that the problems above are not the cause of your problems before counting on the patch to fix it.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

The following are the latest posts from Gordon Wrinn:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034029.html"><b>Experience Ressurections</b></a><br>There's really no way to determine with any certainty that something of this nature occurred. While I realize that some say that everyone's word should be taken for it, I'm sure everyone will agree that this would be taken advantage of to an extreme, which would prevent the GM staff from doing the other parts of their job. <br><br>One thing to remember is that any reimbursement of any kind for any reason is a service provided by us as a way to try and take care of our customers when they've run into a problem. It's not an entitlement, but is indicative of our desire to see that everyone remains unaffected by problems. The vast majority of resurrections that are given are for things that we have no control over, and are just helping out in the interest of providing good customer service. <br><br>To my knowledge, this service isn't provided by any other game operator out there, so it does surprise me a little when people discount our customer service. <br>--<br>Well, we all love to make someone's week, but I can see the petitions and complaints already: <br><br>"When will the rez train be by?"<br>"My friend got rezed and my corpse was right next to his but I didn't???"<br>"GM Soandso only rezes uberguild members. Not fair!"<br>"GM Soandso only rezes you if you're not in a guild. Not fair!"<br>"VI! Why is there no consistancy in the RandomRez(tm) program?!" <br><br>I really don't think that it would be appropriate to increase people's dependency on the GM staff. That's why they don't perform services that can be performed by PCs, aside from odd verified bug death and removing the occasional corpse from the wall.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034014.html"><b>On "No Drop" Item Suggestion</b></a><br>Well we won't make it so that it can't be looted, as people might not want the zones swarming with ungrouped people looking to pick up the scraps. We are however considering putting in a confirmation box that pops up in the event you try to loot a NODROP item that you cannot use.</UL>

Speaking of pets, Alan <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034001.html">added this announcement</a> to the Gameplay Board tonight:<UL><i>A while back magician pets were given the ability to wield weapons. This was a workaround for the fact that these pets were unable to duel-wield properly. <br><br>After the next patch, pets summoned using necromancer or magician spells of 39th level or higher should duel wield, even without weapons. This will also include the shadownight pets that are the same as necromancer pets of 39th level or better. So these pets will be duel wielding properly henceforth.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>Here's a follow-up from Gordon<UL><i>Just one clarification, the "auto dual wield" ability is based upon a calculation of both the dual wield skill and the level of the pet. So, it is possible that you could get good summon at 34th that auto dual wields without weapons, or a bad summon at 39th that doesn't.<br><br>As a note, no change is being made to their likelihood to dual wield. The change is only going to remove the requirement of handing your pet weapons to get them to dual wield at the higher levels.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>One last post from Gordon:<UL>We were told this was impossible on Jan 28. We were told that this would be impossible to code around.<br><br><b><i>Well, it was impossible on January 28th, as the game engine didn't distinguish between pets and other NPCs.</b></i><br><br>Please explain what changed. <br><br><b><i>A good deal of reengineering was done prior to Kunark's launch to create the 59th necro summon that dual-wields without weapons. Additional code was put in as part of the last patch to further differentiate between pets and other NPCs for the proc changes. <br><br>Given these changes I figured that it would be a good time to address a minor annoyance.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Pets continue to be a dominate issue on the boards.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033978.html">first post in a brand new thread</a> created by Gordon:<UL><I>I would have posted this in the other thread but figured that it was different enough to deserve its own thread for discussion:<br><br>I was just sitting here thinking over the latest issue with pet procing, and the sword of runes, and I noticed something. <br><br>A number of the complaints in this thread cite changing something that's been that way since release, or saying that if we are going to nerf something, why don't we fix something before we nerf something else.<br><br>In truth, we did. Mages only got the ability to hand weapons to their pets 10 months ago (January 28th to be precise). The problem with the procs going off on everything and going off so often only became an issue then. Sure, there was the odd necro who had a magician friend who would summon up weapons, but it certainly wasn't wide-spread enough to make a global difference.<br><br>Your pets are more powerful now than they were at release, even given the latest change. They dual wield now. Sure, that was a bug workaround, but the pets were bumped up in power several times before the dual wield workaround because they weren't beating necro pets. In many ways, they became overpowered when they suddenly began dual wielding, an imbalance that wasn't addressed until now. <br><br>So, as you see, we did address a problem that resulted in increasing the power of the pet prior to "nerfing" a small portion of it. Now I do wish that there had been less time between cause and effect, but it's too late for that at this point. The point is that this is not an ability that has been around forever. While I agree that many people might have come to take it for granted, mage pets are still stronger than they were for nearly a year after release.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Here's today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034003.html"><b>More Pet Changes?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: OK - Am I the first to notice that pets are only doing about 2/3 their regular damage in a duel? There is no reason whatsoever for my necro 49 pet to be doing a low 30s in combat with anybody, let alone a PC.]</i></font> <br><br>This change was put in around 15 months ago. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033988.html"><b>Venril Sathir</b></a><br>First, there are approximately 52 weeks in a year. <br><br>Regarding the number of guilds capable of getting the item: From item drop calculations, the number of guilds isn't part of the equation. It's the number of people that counts. <br><br>Finally, no one is entitled to the items. We don't expect that everyone will get them. The specific intent is that they not be acquirable by everyone. Items that are meant to be gotten by everyone are far more common in game. The rarity is purposeful.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033821.html"><b>Nerfs</b></a><br>Very well-explained lordiezu, I probably couldn't do a better job of explaining it if I tried, so I'll leave this thread with your response.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033909.html"><b>Stop Changing Things!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Please Verant, stop changing things that have been that way for a long time!]</i></font> <br><br>I've actually seen a number of requests along these lines, but at the same time, a number of complaints about issues that have "been that way for a long time". <br><br>Is there a middle ground? I don't know. Obviously many would prefer that we only address the complaints and leave the things that no one complains about alone, but at the same time, that couldn't be done while maintaining balance. It's a bit of a catch-22.<br>--<br>Oh, as for the rest of the post, I really don't see a correlation between your ability to roleplay your class and the latest changes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033976.html"><b>Damage Increasing Items</b></a><br>Right. Clarity, mod rods, manaconversion spells or items, and other things along that line serve that purpose. <br><br>Haste sashes for melee give an indirect increase to damage. You swing more, and as such you hit more per period of time and thus do more damage. What the original author suggests is something that directly raises the amount of damage done, but that would be more comparable to new weapons for melee, or new spells for casters.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033481.html"><b>Mage Epic Weapon Quest</b></a><br>I somehow doubt it will remain "unsolved" because of these two items. I believe both have been in game for over a year at this point, and it's reasonable to assume that at some point a mage has gotten both items. <br><br>Right now the bottleneck appears to be the other two items. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033671.html"><b>GM Abuse Stories</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why do Absor and Abishi never respond to these GM abuse stories?]</i></font> <br><br>Well "never" is a bit of an exaggeration, however, hardly anything is ever as "black and white" as it's made to seem in the "GM Abuse" threads. Most of them consist of some player interaction issue where the GM was summoned mid-incident and required to make a decision. The person who the decision went against usually ends up on the board and posts a very clear-cut story explaining why the GM was wrong. <br><br>In all truth, if it *really were* that clear-cut, it is not likely that the GM would have made the wrong decision. <br><br>In any case, responding to these issues in cases where the true happenings is anything less than black or white isn't fruitful. We only have one side of a three-sided story posted in most cases, and one of those sides is not likely to come to the board and post theirs. So there's really no point in arguing it. <br><br>Reports of GM misconduct are forwarded to the customer service management team. In cases where the true story cannot be determined with any certainty, a note is made for the GMs file. Misconduct, when it occurs, is hardly isolated to a single instance, and if a GM shows a pattern it can them be necessary that we go further. <br><br>The same is true for players. It's very easy for someone to be falsely accused once, being falsely accused of the same thing in a half a dozen different instances is another thing entirely. <br><br>Anyway, this board is not the proper place to voice complaints about GMs. It tends to reduce the credability of the complaint as it's being made in a public forum for the purpose of garnering public support. If you wish to report something to the CS team concerning GM misconduct, feel free to email gscotto@station.sony.com directly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033752.html"><b>Contiually Making EQ Harder</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Are we too good? IE: why must the game be constantly made more difficult!]</i></font> <br><br>Well first, you are good. Players have consistantly discovered ways to do things that amaze us to this day. It's therefore essential that we keep raising the bar to provide challenge to those that have figured out how to overcome previous challenges. Obviously, we don't intend to make unbeatable encounters, though we could rarely do that when we tried, but we still need to provide a challenge. <br><br>There's actually two issues here. One, making new content more difficult, which I think should be expected by everyone, as what would be the point if things did not get more difficult as you progressed. <br><br>The other issue is making old content more difficult by reducing the effectivness of tactics that allow a challenge to be overcome without risk. This is a different issue entirely, as some people apparently don't expect this. Here's the short of our intentions: You play the game to have fun. You have fun by overcoming challenges. A challenge is something that has the prospect of failure. Failure must have consequences to be meaningful. Overcoming the challenge without failure yields a reward, whether tangible or ideological. Basically, discovering a way to do something without risk (or with less risk than intended) negates the challenge and creates a situation that we must address in order for the game to be fun.</UL>

Alan stopped by the Gameplay Boards during the holiday break and had the following to say:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033524-2.html"><b>Recent Pet Changes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "I think the thing that bears remembering is that to accomplish the SoR nerf, which mages in general realize is necessary, they also nerfed pet dexterity, which they acknowledged and are "looking into" scaling by level. Not only does this affect the procs of all weapons, but it also affects the pet's ability to hit monsters. I think all mages would be quiet if they just removed the proc from the sword of runes rather than nerfing the pets dexterity."]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, don't remember that. It's not true. <br><br>The ONLY thing that was changed was the artificial increase that pets had to their proc rate.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033899.html"><b>Enchanters and Illusions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Absor your comments please on any of the above." ]</i></font><br><br>Well, here are my thoughts on this: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) It might be a false entry in the sp.dat file, however, Necro's get to become Spectres with a new SoV spell at level 60. Regardless of Level, Enchanter's asked for this spell and we're LIED to be Abashi. He said that it could not be implemented because of "global" memory or some lame ass excuse...THEN Necro's get the ability to summon a Spectre Pet. Regardless of how effective the pet is or is not...We were lied to." ]</i></font><br><br>You and I obviously have different definitions of the word LIED. As I explained in another post, we've improved out technology. Were we could not add more things to the global memory before, we have more room now. You were not lied to. I'm not going to comment on any Scars of Velious spells, real or imagined. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) WHY would you add a "attack power" stat buff to any of our Self Illusions. Abashi STATED numerous times that Enchanter's are not meant to melee and yet they give us Illusion Spirt Wolf (which should have a SoW effect) but instead only gives us Attack Power? Same thing with Illusion Werewolf. " ]</i></font><br><br>Here we can have an interesting discussion about what an 'illusion' is. If it were me making the spells, there would be no effect to an illusion beyond the visual effect. After all, an illusion is just a change of perceptions, not a manifestation of anything real. So, in that way, you're right, I don't think there should be a stat buff on any of the illusions at all. <br><br>But, with the EverQuest definition of Illusion, the spell can incorporate the other powers of the Enchanter, as long as it follows the look and feel of the illusion. There must be some link between the power of the enchanter and the form of the illusion. Enchanters don't have the power to increase foot speed, so there is no way they could move as fast as a wolf with that spell. Besides, keep in mind that we don't want enchanters to cast Spirit of the Wolf. So a strength buff makes some sense, considering the form involved. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) Now Illusion Werewolf (self only) gives us a "haste" effect making us attack faster. Yet the new SoV Group Illusion Werewolf gives a chincy 50 mana? Granted that might not be correct but please rethink this." ]</i></font><br><br>Again, I'm not going to discuss any Scars of Velious spells. <br><br>As for not getting any illusions past level 44, I don't know. I don't know why there are no enchanter illusions past 44. But being a master of illusions doesn't really require it. Enchanters ARE the masters of illusions, and you really can't argue that they aren't. <br><br>Should there be post 44 illusions? Maybe. I can't see why not. And I'll keep it in mind to ask someone about it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033921.html"><b>Barbarian Bards?</b></a><br>There are a lot of class/race combinations that would make sense in EverQuest. But at some point we had to draw a line, so that there would be some race and class diversity. <br><br>Sure, Barbarian bards make sense. So do Dwarven bards (Dwarves are an old race, very interested in their own lore), or Gnomish shadowknights&#8230; this could go on until all races had every class. There just has to be a line somewhere&#8230;</UL>
