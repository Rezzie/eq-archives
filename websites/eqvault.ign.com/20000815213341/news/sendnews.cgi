Gordon Wrinn made a few more posts recently on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the skinny:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-2.html"><b>Play Nice</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BTW, this maybe shoulda been on the rants board, but perhaps GW will come down and answer this mere mortal....why why why do you create rules that are detrimental to the players? Play nice started off as a way to prevent KSing and verbal abuse. Play nice should not be exploited as a means of allowing everyone the same chance at a spot in line for toilet paper...err...getting xp.]</i></font> <br><br>The Play Nice Policies were created because a growing number of customers were being subordinated by other, more powerful, groups of players. These other groups would claim "ownership" of spawns, loot drops, and even entire zones, refusing to allow other people a chance to experience them. On some servers, guilds had certain areas camped 24x7. <br><br>The play nice policies, in regards to spawns and camping, are designed to promote equal access to the areas. If a group can get into a room, they have as much right to be there as anyone else. Are the policies perfect? No, of course what is? No matter what policy we adopt, there will be people who are helped by the policy, and others that are hurt. Sometimes the policy may help them in one instance and hurt in another. <br><br>As I've mentioned in the past, if anyone has any ideas for policies that are easy to understand, are enforcable, do not require a larger CS team than before or after the Play nice policies, and will please everyone, I'd be happy to discuss them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004665.html"><b>Reimbursement For Next Patch Spell Change?</b></a><br>We're fairly open about the fact that things in game are subject to change at any time. This includes the prospect of both positive and negative changes. People making trades in game need to be aware that that there exists a chance that any item is likely to drop in value or usefulness after you buy it. It's sort of like buying stock in a company in that regard. <br><br>The spell was never supposed to be usable by magicians, who ended up able to use it only because the level restriction was transposed by the designer. I really wish we'd caught this sooner.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004601.html"><b>"Witch" Post Removed</b></a><br>Hello all, I just deleted a post suggesting that a new class ("Witch") be created. The thread was deleted because it degenerated into the disparaging of practiced religion (Wicca). <br><br>As a note to the original author of that post, as that certainly wasn't his intention, we wouldn't create a class by that name due to the fact that it does apply to a currently practiced religion. The same doesn't apply to reference to "priests" or "monks", as those are nondescript titles in nature, and as such not indicative of any particular religion. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004822.html"><b>Disgruntled With Customer Service</b></a><br>Nicolbolas, <br><br>I'm sorry that I can't address all of your issues, but I can't address *every* issue here on the boards. Besides the fact that there are 300-400 new threads per day, there's another 4000 posts to go with them. This means that chances are your *post* won't be addressed. However, if you stick around long enough, your *issue* probably will. Of course, if your issue has already been addressed, it might be a while before I'll come back to it. There are issues on this board that we could debate full-time for months and never reach any agreeable resolution. I however can't devote all of my time to any one issue. <br><br>You might notice however that I addressed your post on the "Draught" line 20 minutes before you wrote this post. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004818.html"><b>"Ester's affront to all dwarves!"</b></a><br>GASP! :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000745.html"><b>Wizard Draughts </b></a><br>The Draught line was created to give wizards the option of doing less damage at similar mana/damage ratio compared to ice comet, and also to give them similar spells across the three elements that the wizards control. The reasoning behind "less damage" was to reduce the amount that the wizard would aggro the target. Had we wanted to continue along the same lines as ice comet, we could have given similar damage spells with equal damage, mana, and casting time requirements. <br><br>In this case, the additional time required to stack two draughts versus one ice comet is what you "pay" for the reduced amount that you aggro the target. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003933.html"><b>Nerfs 'N Bugs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Hey Bashi!

Gordon cleared up a few rumors about the eqclient.ini file on the Gameplay Board this afternoon.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004497.html">the thread</a>:<UL>Abashi himself posted instructions on how to edit it the eqclient.ini manually via Notepad when the new colors went into effect with the latest patch. There's something better out there, though.<br>Some nice people have gone out of their way to create a program that makes the .ini file easier to edit. You just click on the different types of text messages to edit their colors in the game, or change the default run/walk mode, HUD view or full screen, even change background colors. (That last one I didn't even know could be done.)<br><br>My question is, does Verant consider this to be a 3rd-party program that can result in banning of players using it? Since all it does is make it easier to make the same changes that Verant has given us instruction on, and does not affect the actual gameplay in any way, I would think there is no problem with it. Just wanna hear it from the horse's mouth, though. :)<br><br><b><I>No, we wouldn't consider use of EQCLIENT.INI editors as cheating. They are just fancy text editors :) I should probably mention that none of them are, however, officially licensed or endorced by Verant/SOE, and that any use of them is at your own risk. Though I'm sure that the vast majority of people would never do this, with the ease of implementing password-stealing code into a 3rd party program, I'd recommend that you be certain of your source. <br><br>-Gordon </b></i></UL>

A <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396.html">new thread</a> was started by Verant's Gordon Wrinn this Sunday centering on the issue of PvP Teams.  Here's the entire post from the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>Hello,<br><br>I posted this in another thread but it seems to warrant its own.<br><br>The biggest difficulty in regards to PvP in EverQuest is that EverQuest is, and will remain, a primarily PvE (Player versus Environment) game. The addition of PvP to the game should not change the basic fundemental mechanics of EverQuest. PvP in EverQuest has to result in "EverQuest with PvP" rather than "PvP EverQuest", if you get my point. <br><br>One of the largest issues on the PvP Teams servers is the subject of cross-teaming. Players of different teams get together for battles. Due to the PvE focus of the game, this has to be allowed for sake of game balance. Though some have suggested that cross-teaming, either in groups or guilds, not be allowed, it's something that will need to remain for the PvE game.<br><br>The problem comes in when cross-teaming is applied to PvP. Cross-teaming creates a situation that is often referred to as the "invulnarable healer" scenario. Basically, one group of PCs (Team A) attack a group of people on Team B, while supported by a healer from Team B. In this fashion, you have a situation where a member of one team is taking an active role in the deaths of members of their own team.<br><br>There is another "invulnarable healer" scenario that is more common and often just as bad as the cross-teaming scenario. This one revolves around a group of players from Team A attacking a group from Team B, while supported by a healer/buffer who is far superior in level to anyone from Team A or Team B. For example, a group of level ~20 trolls go on a killing spree in Greater Faydark, while supported by a level 50 healer/buffer. The problem in this case is that someone out-of-range is directly contributing to the deaths of players below their range.<br><br>On Friday, I spoke with one of the programmers about possible solutions for the PvP Teams servers, assuming that people in general believe these issues to be a problem. Suffice it to say that there is no easy solution. Each one has its disadvantages and "loopholes". For an example of some of the solutions:<br><br>1. Disallow cross-team buffing/healing<br>2. Disallow out-of-level (+/- 8) buffing/healing<br>3. Combination of 1 & 2.<br>4. Redefine "Teams" servers to GvE (good versus evil) servers and implement idea #1 on that basis, rather than on cross-teaming.<br><br>The problem with all of these solutions is that they have an undeniable impact upon the PvE aspect of the game. <br><br>The final and best idea that we were able to come up with allows things to continue as they are now in regards to PvE, and only places restrictions on the basis of PvP. In this idea, any player who has taken damage from another player would not be able to be healed/buffed/receive any beneficial spells from anyone who wasn't on their own team or in the +/- 8 level range for a given amount of time (a few minutes), or until they zoned. <br><br>In the cross-teaming "invulnarable healer" scenario, the person from Team B would be able to support people from Team A for PvE engagements, however once a member of Team A took damage from another team, they would not be able to receive support from anyone on Team B for a few minutes. In a real game scenario, the maurading band of trolls in Greater Faydark couldn't be healed/buffed by a high-elf assuming that they were taking damage in their attacks. <br><br>In the out-of-level scenario, that same band of level ~20 trolls wouldn't be able to receive support from a 50th level cleric. <br><br>There are some disadvantages to this, such as in the following:<br><br>4 Trolls are grouped with a high-elf fighting PvE encoutners in a dungeon. Humans come in and "slap" the trolls every so often thus keeping the high-elf from assisting them. Perhaps this should just be a disadvantage for cross-teaming in general. Perhaps this is just a risk that people take from grouping with the enemy.<br><br>What are your thoughts on these ideas? What other issues do you see causing problems in regard to this idea? Do the benefits (e.g. reaffirming the servers as PvP Teams) outweigh the potential disadvantages? <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Verant's Gordon Wrinn on the Official Boards:<br><ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/001657.html"><b>Gordon or Abashi Please Answer This As Best You Can </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I believe EQ players currently have access to 3 Planes. I believe all 3 are malevolent. Are there any plans in the works for a benevolent plane to be made accessable to players. Just seems like an even trade off. Just thinking maybe some of the characters that are paticpating in the slaying of Innoruck and Cazic would probably feel more comfortable encountering their gods adversaries.<br>Also, I was wondering what kind of faction hits do characters get after slaying someone like Innoruck or Cazic? Its gotta be Incredible]</i></font><br><br>Actually the Plane of Sky really isn't malevolent in nature. It's there to test the resolve of Norrath's citizens.<br>In regards to your question however, though I can't really release any information, we're definitely aware of the players' desire to whup up on the minions of some of Norrath's kinder deities.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002666.html"><b>Need definite rule re: Invulnerable Healers on PvP team servers </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am running through a zone when I observe a PvP fight. A dwarven palladin is laying the smack down on a poor dark elf. I check the health on the DE and seeing he is about to die, I heal and SoW him. This allows him to run away. Both combatants were in their low teens, whereas I am level 27. Am I going to be warned?]</i></font><br><br>No.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My guild runs to Nek forest and starts laying waste. We have 6 members, 5 of whom are level 20, and the sixth is a level 40 cleric. The cleric is only there to heal the other 5 and no one in the zone on the opposing team is high enough to attack him. Is my guild in trouble?]</i></font><br><br>No.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A group of Evils is attacking a group of Elves. Everyone in the fight is of equal level. However, the darks have brought with them a cross-teaming Elf, who heals the Evils, and can't be attacked by the other Elves since he is on the same team as them. Is the cross teaming Elf going to be banned?]</i></font><br><br>No, there are currently no rules againt the "invulnarable healer", whether its due to an "out of range" healer or a "cross-teaming" healer.<br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No one should be invulerable in combat and you shouldn't have to call an enemy to kills guys of your own race. A design flaw to be sure and this should at least be commented on or addressed by Verant. ]</i></font><br><br>Brega, you can say that the system is flawed and should be fixed, but none of the solutions that have been presented have been endorsed by plurality, much less a majority of the players. There are certainly some pretty rash and obscure things that we could do to try and "fix" this to your liking, but what of everyone else? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I've never seen this addressed by Abashi either. Most players just want Racewars to be coded as Racewars. Invulerable healing and buffing to help "Racewar enemy teams" defeat your own team should be coded out as impossible.]</i></font><br><br>Sure, that seems simple, but what is the reasoning behind, for instance, a human paladin and a high-elf paladin to "refuse" (cf. be restricted by code) to heal or buff each other? Why *must* there be animosity between them?<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Make the healer attackable by his own team for say the next 2 minutes everytime he heals (this happens in guild wars, so it should be possible); ]</i></font><br><br>Can't do this with the way that attack rights are handle. In EQ, if I can attack you, you can also attack me. There's no way around that mechanism. The exploit that pops out is that all I'd have to do to be able to go kill my own team would be to cast a beneficial spell on someone of another team. EQ also can't handle a persistant agressor flag. We know who is casting the spell and who the recipient is at the time the spell is cast, but not after. The same is true with melee attacks.<br><br>These are the options available to us:<br><br>1. Do nothing.<br>2. Disallow beneficial spells across teams. (handles cross-teaming problem)<br>3. Disallow beneficial spells out-of-level (handles, for the most part, the out-of-level situation)<br>4. A combination of 2&3.<br><br>The difficulty is that while we want to support PvP and the Teams servers, we cannot in that process harm the PvE aspects of the game. It's still going to be EverQuest, but will be EverQuest with PvP, rather than PvP EverQuest. <br><br>There's another possible solution (if indeed people feel that there is a problem) that one of the programmers and I were just brainstorming about. Please let me know if you feel that there are any unacceptable problems with this....<br><br>How about... If a player takes damage from another PC, they can only receive beneficial spells from someone in their own team for X-minutes or until they zone.<br><br>Let's apply this to the 3 scenarios that the original poster mentions:<br><br>Case #1: Dwarf is attacking DE1. DE2 is over 8 levels above DE1. Since DE2 is out-of-level with DE1, DE1 cannot take his beneficial spells since he's being attacked by the dwarf. DE2's only option would be to attack the dwarf if he was in range, but in this case, he's not. <br><br>Case #2: The level 40 DE cleric would not be able to support he level 20 marauders since he is out of range.<br><br>Case #3: Evils are attacking elves. Assuming that the elves have done damage to the evils, evils could not be healed/buffed by the cross-teaming elf.<br><br>Other scenarios:<br><br>Human is grouped with 3 elves, they can buff each other all day long. However, a troll attacks the human. The human can now only be healed by other people on the human team.<br><br>Human is grouped with 3 elves, and can buff, etc... The troll now attacks one of the elves. That elf cannot receive direct support from the human, but can from the other elves. The human could, of course, attack the troll if he was in range, just couldnt' heal the elf.<br><br>Any problems with this idea that you can think of?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003672.html"><b>Rogue Theft </b></a><br>Though I appreciate your concern nyrulz, it's a little known fact that a rogue cannot pickpocket the last coin of any type off of a creature. This means that if the creature is spawned with 1g3s5c, the most the rogue can pickpocket is 2s4c. He can't get the gold. <br>That said, I wouldn't let a bad experience with one member of a class taint your feeling towards grouping with that class. Rogues, like everyone else, are played by people on the other side of keyboard, who can be either nice or jerks regardless what class they play.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003987.html"><b>Abashi: I lowered my beta neutral and can't raise it </b></a><br>Talk to a GM in game about this.

Yellow "blips" are MOBs, White "blips" are buildings and (I think) other PCs. It has a line-of-sight area (approx 90 deg), and the rest is out of sight (grayed over).]</i></font><br><br>I've seen what you suggest, however it was decided long ago that "radar" of that nature wouldn't be a part of EQ. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:Could something of this nature be implemented into EQ? This would be immensely helpful to players. Being able to see any and all MOBs in your general vicinity would be a great help. I can attest personally to how valuable it could be, as I've been attacked countless times by MOBs I didn't even know were there.]</i></font><br><br>But people have been prospering in game without something artificial like "radar" there. People learn to work together and post lookouts when in dangerous areas, and pay the price when they don't. The chance of something "sneaking up" on you is one of the dangers in the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004216.html"><b>Camping is a by product of lazy design... </b></a><br>The maximum rate at which things can come in game is tied directly to the availability of the rarest component. A quest with 20 steps that each take an hour, while being a 20 hour quest, lets items into the game at a rate of 1 per hour. <br><br>I'm wondering how rare we need to make things to stop camping. The easiest thing to do would be to make everything random. Of course there wouldn't be much point to quests then (e.g. "Kill in lower guk until you get a X and bring it to me).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004221.html"><b>Abashi, a simple YES/NO please </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will anything ever be done to make the Disarm/Sense Traps skills even the least bit useful?]</i></font><br><br>We have no plans to increase the usefulness of these skills either by increasing the number of traps in the game nor through revamping the skills. The lack of a use for these skills was one of the driving forces behind redefining the rogue as more of an assassin rather than a theif, and as such, rogues have been thoroughly compensated (as much as I hate using that word). We would remove the skills from the list if it were possible, unfortunately some technical issues prevent that. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004229.html"><b>User Interface INTENTIONALLY bugged??!?!

They weren't lowered when Kunark came out, they were raised, and they remained raised. Both PCs had the same buffs, stats, and items (save weapons). Everything that they had was attainable in game. I wanted to do the test max-hasted, to insure that everything is equal. Without including the enchanter buff, it would only have improved the monks advantage, espicially when bare knuck.</ul>
