Check out what Alan's been saying in today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000155.html"><b>Ragefire</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Once again, the point is missed. There is no complaint about the difficulty of the quest. The complaint is that a situation rife with conflict is created. Constant fighting over the Ragefire spawn is creating much conflicts between players and guilds. Some guilds have gone as far as assigning members time slots to continually camp the zone to alert the guild as to when the spawn is up and to shout out that they have the spawn camped. Since Verant refuses to regulate these types of actions in any way, naturally conflict arises when others try to come in to "take" the spawn. This is only one example of increased conflict and fighting in the game. The planes are another good example. Since the planes went to free for all, guilds are not fighting with each other over the boss and mini boss spawns, specifically in Hate and Fear. Verant needs to take a look at this closely and perhaps come up with some sort of plan to reduce this conflict. ]</i></font><br><br>I don't think I missed the point at all, though I readily admit that I might have. So I'll try again to explain myself. <br><br>What if Ragefire was to just appeared every 3 days right smack in the center of North Karana, at exactly the same time and in exactly the same place? Hand him the quest item and he hands you the epic and then goes away for 3 more days. No spawn timer issues, no trigger issues, just hand this guy an item every three days. Even if it was set up like that, there would be just as much controversy over him. <br><br>The problem here has very little to do with any of the spawn timers, spawn triggers, or any of that stuff. The problem is almost entirely caused by the volume of characters wanting to complete this epic. In the imaginary scenario above you would have just as many people waiting for the 3 day spawn, there would be just as much fighting over who should get to turn in their item to get the epic. You'd be just as frustrated as you are now. <br><br>The reason that the only suggestions that I have about fixing this issue seem negative is because they are. The only way to reduce the conflict here is to reduce the number of people clawing at each other to get this item. To do that we'd either have to make the quest a lot harder or make the item less desirable. I suppose the other solution is to let the item come into the game faster, but we're not going to do that. <br><br>I'm still willing to go back to the team and try to make the quest much harder all down the line. But most would consider that a nerf. And I suspect that even if it was a lot harder to do the quest, with all the desire for this item there would be just as many clerics lined up at whatever choke points there are fighting with each other over this thing. <br><br>I don't see that I'm missing anything here. 30 to 50 clerics and all of their friends fighting to get an item that can only come into the game so often is going to cause conflict.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000168.html"><b>Poll of Interest</b></a><br>Just passing this on. This has nothing to do with any intercompany rivalry or anything of the sort&#8230; <br>:)<br><br>The folks at working on that silly Star Wars Galaxies thing have put up a poll.

I accidently put /move in my message bar and got an error message about how to use move log appropriately (apparently you must put yes afterwards). This startled me, and then concerned me, and then confused me. What exactly would happen to someone who types /move yes when a move log for that server is not scheduled. Are the automatically signed up for the next move log should it occur? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Syran Alchion<br>32 Cleric of Tunare<br>Flame of the Phoenix<br>Tarew Marr ]</i></font><br><br>Not a problem. Move logs need to be 'opened' before the command will do anything. If you do the command before or after the move log is open, nothing happens.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>Populations and Economies</b></a><br>Dr_syKosis wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: How about a certain variation of the armor-eating dragon? <br><br>Let's say the entrance to this dragon's lair is protected by a sentry who you either a) must kill (but is lvl 65, death touches, regens, mana sinks, cheetah speed, etc... you get the point) or b) requires a certain piece of equipment to get in. <br><br>If, for example, there are too many Yaks in the game, program him so he asks for a Yak in order for your group to pass. Make it a table of loot he will ask for so it's different each time. <br><br>This dragon will of course drop uber class specific god-loot, but more importantly will decrease the saturation of "old-world" items in the game. If you make the spawn of the dragon long, but worthwhile, the item loss won't be at such a drastic pace that it'll upset the economy. I'm sure he won't eat a Yak a day, but maybe a Yak a month would work! ]</i></font><br><br>Also a nice idea. I'm not sure about actually being able to do it in the game as it is, though. Allowing an NPC to wait to be aggressive based on you NOT doing something might be kinda hard. <br><br>But some variation on that theme might work nicely. <br><br>Thanks. <br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I would like to make a suggestion regarding both the quantity of high level items as well as the population bulge of high level characters. <br><br>I'd like to see a retirement quest. Something that requires the character to have many of the higher level items to complete. Once complete, the character would become unplayable. The reward for such a quest would need to be fame. Name in lights sort of thing about which guilds and players could compete and brag. Or perhaps a nodrop, obscure, not terribly useful item that could stack and thus be counted. A moving on, as it were, to the next step in their karmic evolution. <br><br>Aidal Teamnoir - cleric35, druzzil ro ]</i></font><br><br>I've always liked the idea of retiring characters. But, well, in reality most of us want to be able to play those characters again some day. It's pretty unlikely that anyone would retire a character without some sort of fantastic reward. Fame would be good, but might not be enough. The idea of 'morphing' characters upon retirement would be pretty cool (retiring a character would open up a new class or race that can only be accessed this way), but would require a lot of creativity and balance and testing and all that, for a return that would only go to a few. <br><br>I really like the idea, but I'm not sure it's practical. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: NOOO BAD IDEAA!!! I dont like the fact of mobs taking EXP AND MY MONEY!!!!<br>*Grabs his pile of coin* BACK AWAY FROM THE PLAT!!<br>And dont even think about touching my robe.<br>Glinlor Stormweaver ]</i></font><br><br>Well, obviously you have plenty of platinum there, you could certainly spare some for a mild-mannered dragon just trying to buy food?

I make mistakes too, ya know. <br><br>Electrae wrote: <br><br>[/b]I'm actually happy you all are willing to eat crow and go back and revisit those things you said would "never, ever, ever change in a million years".

My comments are the ones that are not bolded. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Regarding the balancing of Melee vs Caster Haste items, to rebut your arguments: <br><br>1. Most caster spells are offensive in nature, at least for certain classes. ]</i></font><br><br>I agree. For some classes a lot of spells are offensive. But only for some casters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. If a class has some utility spells to burn mana on as well, how does that make a mana regen spell more unbalancing?]</i></font> <br><br>Because they could cast more of those spells than they can currently. When looking for a solution for a specific problem, I want answers that only target that particular problem. Since even without reading further I know where you're headed, let's state the perceived problem. Wizards can't sustain their damage output in fights that last longer than those that existed before Velious. This is the issue you're heading at. And, sure, giving Wizards a larger mana pool or a form of massive mana regeneration would fix it. But it also makes them more efficient in all other forms of casting. To 'balance' that out, we'd have to increase the mana cost on all non-damage wizards spells. <br><br>I'd rather find a more specific solution. And the bane spells are a good solution. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. Casters are totally mana dependant, melees are not totally attack speed dependant (their HP/AC is as useful as their damage output in tank cases) ]</i></font><br><br>Not true. Casters are just as AC and HP dependent as anyone else. It's just that their hit points come in the form of melee classes and pets, in much the same way that melee characters draw their hit points from healers and their speed from casters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. So long as they stack w/ Bard/Chanter spells, they do not hurt the other classes. ]</i></font><br><br>Agreed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5. Flowing Thought I is so miniscule it's ridiculous... imagine a melee getting a drop from Cazic that gave +0.5% haste... ]</i></font><br><br>Also agreed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 6. If you're worried that giving us a decent mana regen item would make us too powerful when we have C2 in a group, that can be worked around while still allowing us to have some solo mana regen. ]</i></font><br><br>When did we ever identify a need for casters to be more able to solo? That's not a problem that we intend to address. A lack of ability to solo is not an issue that needs to be addressed <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Fact is, our mana regen is not sufficient for soloing in the high levels. It is somewhat acceptable in groups w/ C2. Give us a mana regen item effect that stops working when grouped or something. Or give us mana regen items that don't stack (effect overwritten by chanter/bard) and have lower regen than a Clarity of appropriate level (say for a Fear item, give us 1/2 to 3/4 of C2). ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, we could create some sort of mana regeneration thing that only works when in groups. In fact, we already have. They are called bards and enchanters (and sometimes necromancers). Hey, that kinda rhymes&#8230; <br><br>Again, increased mana regeneration is not a specific solution for any problem with any caster class that we've identified. You haven't identified one here either, except an inability to solo (which is NOT an issue for many classes, since many casters can solo very well). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: While I'm on this hotbutton Wizard topic - Wizards all over would really appreciate it if you would give some very straightforward yes/no type answers to the following questions, to help them decide whether to delete their account now or not, so stop beating around the bush... ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not beating around any bushes. I'm telling you what I've told you before, until we're done balancing things there is nothing to tell. But I'll give you several probably and maybe answers, if that helps. Just remember that until all the class balance issues are done, NONE of this is a promise. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 1 - Will our mana regen improve? ]</i></font><br><br>Probably not. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2 - Will our dmg/time improve? ]</i></font><br><br>Probably not. Heck, wizards have a great damage over time ratio and this isn't even something that we're looking at improving. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3 - Will our dmg/mana improve? ]</i></font><br><br>Bane spells. Other than that, I don't know. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4 - Is our single most primary attribute now "Masters of Transportation" for balancing purposes? ]</i></font><br><br>Isn't now, hasn't been in the past, probably won't be in the future. Just because you are the 'best' at travel does not mean that travel is what you do best. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5 - If the above isn't a clear yes, is Damage considered the top priority for us, or at least even with transport? ]</i></font><br><br>There is no 'top priority' for any class. That's very misleading question. <br><br>Let's look at another class, to help keep perspective. <br><br>When talking about balancing, let's say, Magicians, yes, the first thing we'll probably look at will be their pets. But will that be the 'priority' for balancing that class? Who knows. What we'll do is look at everything that the class can do, find the holes, and see if we want to fill them. If we do, then yes, it's likely we'll again look at pets for filling those holes. <br><br>But you can't fill damage dealing holes with teleportation spells (in much the same way that you don't use a broad thing like mana regeneration to fill damage dealing holes). <br><br>For some reason people think that we are using the new teleportation spells to as a balancing tool, despite the fact that I've mentioned that these spells are going in as part of a long term plan unrelated to class balance. Yes, we're including them in the package that is the wizard when we look at the class as a whole, but it's pretty silly to even suggest that we would use a teleportation spell to help wizards sustain their damage potential against high hit point NPCs&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Thanks,<br>Cabot of Tholuxe Paells ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, that was of topic and I ranted a bit to boot.

Geebus brings us the following announcement::<BLOCKQUOTE>I invite all yee that call themselves newbies to an event taking place on the Nameless server in the Qeynos Hills this Friday (5/11) at 7:00 PM PST. There have been reports of an evil baby dragon by the name of Geebus terrorizing the Qeynos area, and he has finally been driven into the hills. Though he poses less of a threat here, the mischevious scaled one has still been wreaking havock upon all passers-by, and his reign must be put to rest. Look for one Krintix to assist you in defeating this foe, as well as the wandering Holy Man, Gaian.

To he who defeats the baby dragon Geebus go the spoils. <br><br>/ooc . . . For this event, "newbies" are only considered to be those between the levels of five and ten.

Fine prizes indeed. More may be given out from the wandering Holy Man, Gaian, the confused elemental, Xrec, and the bombastic alchemist, Krintix. It all depends on how creative you want to be.

Also just like damage spells, Theft of Thought can be partially resisted.

Believe me, your going to see solb FLOODED with people trying desperatly to fix their faction... ITs going to take me several months to fix what I've dont to mine, meanwhile I will be taking 2 or 3 "Camps" in solb away from people who could gain experiance there. <br><br>Any chance you could reset the gnome faction, or stick that vendor on BetaNeutral? If not, I fear that since their nodrop and people can't just buy em off someone with good faction, solb is going to be a VERY crowded place. ]</i></font><br><br>I understand that problem. But we this is one of the times where we have to say, sorry, that's the way it is. <br><br>Suppose we were to have placed a neat new item on a vendor that had good faction with&#8230; dunno, let's say Dwarves. Then some people who had bad faction with Dwarves would have to fix that to use the vendor and get the item. You knew that Gnomes are the guys that make some of the more interesting items in the game (can you say Tinker's Bag?). If we added a new vendor purchasable Axe of Dwarven Stone to a vendor on the docks in Butcherblock that was on a Dwarven faction, then I'd also be saying to you "sorry, but that's who sells the item". <br><br>The only solution to this concern would be to <b>never</b> add a new item unless it was on a vendor that would sell to everyone. That's not a restriction we're willing to work under. <br><br>This is the vendor that should sell this item.

I'm hoping that the design team has considered the faction issues involved with the gnomes in Sol A.

I would hope that this has been thoroughly tested and is reasonable for evil race, evil class, evil god folks. <br><br>Not that I personally have an issue, I got my j-boots with uncommon luck a long time ago. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Noamu'Chath BloodOath<br>The Relentless<br>Cazic Thule Server ]</i></font><br><br>Hi there. <br><br>Yes, our testers did just that. They used an Iksar worshiper of Cazic and a Troll Shaman of Innoruuk, and they were able to purchase the boots with some faction work. It was not a devastating task. People in house have done it too, even in the few short days since the patch.

As most people know, you can get faction with a mob merely by being on its hatelist when it dies -- a level 60 necromancer (who will not get experience from *anything* in Sol A) can simply set up camp where some lower-level players have, and cast his level 1 lifetap spell on each mob as the group fights it. Or better yet, a spell in the Engulfing Darkness line, thus helping out the lowbies as well as getting on the hatelist. <br><br>Of course, you should ask the lowbies before you do this, but I've never run into someone who minded me getting faction from the mobs they were fighting (as long as I didn't killsteal!). <br><br>- Teramenor ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for pointing that out. <br><br>Getting faction is pretty darn easy now, unlike the olden days when you had to get credit for the kill to get the faction modifier&#8230; <br><br>And you don't have to destroy the fun of others to do it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Who was that masked quote-man? :)<br><br>- Xelene Solyric ]</i></font><br><br>Oh, oops. <br><br>I'll edit that.

We all would have gladly agreed to not petition for help, corpse recovery or anything if the GM had been able to help us out. We were accepting a wild risk for some great fun. We belonged in Delnir. We were of the apropriate level and size, so we were not abusing the powers. It was clear to everyone including the GM's, but their hands were still tied." <br><br>Alan said:<br>"Unfortunately we just don't have one GM for every 6 players..." <br><br>What was tieing the GM's hands in this? I understand that Verant can't afford a group GM for everyone. But, in this case they seemed to have already gotten some of the GMs time. Why not a quick port to where they wanted to go? <br><br>Only reason I can think of is for fear they (the GM) were being set up. An easy way to the 'deep dungeon'. I think this area of 'GM powers' needs to be re-evaluated. They need to be given a freer hand. As a player, I would not have a problem with the GM or Verdant if some group cheated in this way. Who cares? They only cheat themselves. <br><br>Let the GM's do more 'fun' stuff, and less police work. One of the big 'hooks' when I started playing was the thought that it was possible to get into a mini-adventure run by a GM/Guide. This was the view of the players I started with (some time in 6'99). We all now know that it won't ever happen. The closest thing we've seen is a "GM event". We have even been part of a few, but only to the extent of fighting some gang of MoBs (werewolves in this case) on the other side of the zone from the "main" event. <br><br>Again, I understand the resource issue. My suggestion is re-weigh the resource usage balance. It needs to tip more in the "dynamic content" direction than it does currently is. I think the planed events are awesome, don't get me wrong. The story of Norrath needs to "move along". Situations like Ziff Harbinger's should be the result of "not any GMs available" rather than "We aren't allowed to do that." <br><br>-= Reptanis ]</i></font><br><br>Well, unfortunately, we always have to be aware of the possibility that someone is trying to scam us. We also have to be worried about looking as though we are playing favorites. I really hate that we have to do that, and that it restricts our activities when it comes to creativity. But in the reality of our situation we have little other choice. And that's why we have to say "No, we're not allowed to do that" to people some times. <br><br>And it's easy to suggest that GMs do less police work and more fun stuff. But they are doing the 'police work' because it needs to be done. How much fun would the game be if nobody was there to rescue your corpse from a bit of corpse-eating geometry? And as much as we don't like doing it, convincing players to behave themselves when needed is something we need to do. It makes the game more fun, really. <br><br>It might be interesting to have it so that someone can work with people all the time on their personalized quest ideas. And those quests would be a lot of fun. But when it was over, if the GMs were not doing what they do now, you're daily adventuring could very well be filled with nastiness and grief players (and, of course, corpse-eating walls and rocks and such&#8230;). <br><br>But we do have an events staff and our Quest Masters who are dedicated to providing more interactive content. Streamlining their tools and finding ways for them to 'do more with less' &#8211; as they used to tell us all the time in the Government &#8211; is something we work on, and something we want to put more effort into in the near future. <br><br>Oh, and I fixed the title by taking out the apostrophes. So don't think that I don't know that it should be "EverQuest's" and not "EverQuests"... I know, it's just that the apostrophe messes up some browsers. Silly HTML.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing For Experience, Not Loot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Camping in Lower Guk for a few hours is hardly any effort compared to a quest that takes a couple hours. The only difference is that camping in Lower Guk for a few hours is incredibly boring, however doing a quest for a a few hours is MUCH more enjoyable...at least for me anyway. It would be awesome if there were quests that yielded a full bubble (or at least a significant amount) of experience at higher levels. ]</i></font><br><br>Here is where I get somewhat confused. <br><br>For me, if doing something is fun, that's why I'll do it. If questing is more fun than camping, then why are people camping? <br><br>The only answer that I can think of is that some people get more fun out of gaining levels and items than they do out of playing the game. So that they will trade two hours of fun for two hours of something they are not enjoying and some experience and loot. <br><br>Knowing that doesn't, however, provide me with any insight that I didn't already have. It just serves to confuse me. <br><br>von_thorin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: In response to "Why not get a Yellow bub of exp for doing a quest" ... well ... Why Not? I clearly see your intend but don't understand the pause on a quest giving some non-trival amount of exp. <br><br>If a quest is build that requires: Hours of game time to complete, puzzles to figure out, spawn rates to deal with , possible trade skills, and other involved player (s) interaction to complete it ... Why can't the reward be Exp instead of some Phat Loot? <br><br>It seems that many are asking for just this type of quest. IE ... give me something to do that requires my mind, knowledge, ability, and possible team action ... over a game time period to gain exp. Knights of old were always sent out to deal with problems, issues, or other Mundane things (At least to them) to grow them in charactor and experience. Build the quest right and people will beg for more. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, here's the thing. <br><br>Fighting your way to the bottom of a dungeon re quires that you use your mind, that you have knowledge (at least on how to play your character in a tight combat), that you have ability and will require team action, and you will gain experience doing it. <br>And yet, very few people do it. <br><br>I would suggest that quests that require all the attributes that you suggest would be deemed too hard for the reward. Or if the reward was great enough to be 'worth all that trouble', then the reward would probably be overpowered&#8230; <br><br>I certainly agree that quests like those that you describe would be great. I'd love them. But they wouldn't reduce the number of people that sit on their butts at a spawn point and complain about how bored they are. <br><br>It would, though, thoroughly entertain those of us that like to be challenged. And that seems a noble goal. But making great quests takes a lot more time than making challenging NPCs to fight (heck, making a challenging NPC to fight might be just a small portion of a great quest). So we will always get more bang for our time making new NPCs than making new quests. <br><br>That doesn't mean making new and awesome quests isn't a goal. It's just that you might always see more combat stuff than you see new complicated quests over any given period of time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: you wanted to know things you could build quest around besides camping and tradeskills. <br><br>Faction (which could also be used to limit the number of times a quest is done...have completion of the quest faction you right out of quest faction, and no other way to alter that faction). <br><br>Then people have to build faction to do the (simple) quest. <br><br>Example, the Wizard recluse(like many), is a recluse. He is on his very own Wizard Recluse faction. He is convinced that he can make himself better using a formula of say....wasp venom sacks. Now, being a recluse, he won't talk to you unless you are warmly to him. <br><br>You get to warmly by killing drolvargs or perfoming various other quests (bring him various lore no drop items). <br><br>Once you complete the wasp venom quest, however, his project fails and he blames you for the problem. You go to dubious and can never raise above that status (or its a LOT of faction work). <br><br>just one example...I know there is at least one guy up there who is great with this quest stuff...look at the Rogue Ragebringer quest....this was REALLY well done. Its a nice story and everything. <br><br>Leirra ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, that's not far from the way some quests already work. It's also something that I've mentioned to a few team members&#8230; Great minds think alike. :)<br><br>We have several fantastic quest designers on the team. In fact, the whole team rocks at that sort of thing.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000161.html"><b>More Patch Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor,<br><br>I remember reading that when the faction change was to take place. The current faction would be reset also as well for players. My questions are, will this still be occuring? And if so will this effect any positive faction that has been gained? Such as building faction with the Iksars to be able to enter their city etc...If it does effect the faction that was gained. I personally (and probably many others)would not want it reset. As it took many days (real life), alot of money (hiring newbies) and caused near insanity building the faction. And to have all that lost to an update would be very frustrating. If you could shed some light on this issue, it would be appreciated. Otherwise I guess I will find out soon after the patch =). <br><br>Thanks,<br>Grim ]</i></font><br><br>We are still planning on setting up an 'amnesty period' of some sort, where people would be able to get their factions adjusted slightly to help reduce the past effects of faction loss for PvP combat. But it may be a little while. <br><br>The two ideas, reducing faction hits for PvP and trying to restore faction hits taken from PvP combat are linked, but they aren't really dependant on each other. They are linked by the change in ideology that faction hits are too much of a hindrance to PvP. But we had to change the way faction hits were being given out before we worried about redressing old PvP faction hits. <br><br>Right now we're still trying to figure out the best way to tackle that. We would like it to consume as little time as possible, both for players and for us. So we're going to take our time and find a solution that works well and simply. So it may be a little while (E3 is coming, and we're busy enough right now), but we still plan to do it. <br><br>And I doubt we'd be reducing factions, only raising them to adjust for faction hits taken during PvP (not for faction hits taken for other things).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000112.html"><b>Special Food Items</b></a><br>LadyMbc wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Uhm, you imply here that the only reason for right-click eating your food is to see the emote.

Darksome and Kryonis informed us of these events:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night in the castle of Mistmoore, 55 Half-Elf Ranger Darksome<br>Greyshadow and 55 Human Monk Kryonis Sougai were about to head out after a<br>brief argument with the cooks in the kitchen, but were met by a beautiful<br>Dark Elf lady named Khasra Vei`Ras. My trusty companion Kryonis greeted<br>her, and in difference to most other NPCs in this area, she actually spoke<br>back. We were quite surprised and a conversation started.<br><br>She welcomed us and informed us that she was the "keeper" of the castle<br>while her "master" was out. And that she meant us no harm, for if she did<br>we would be dead by now. Her reason for seeking us out, she said, was that<br>she was wondering if we knew anything about the chosen one (Firiona) and<br>why she was spotted in Lesser Faydark, and if these stories was indeed<br>true. It came around to one of us mentioning a unicorn and the story<br>progressed further.. After we were done talking she left and ordered a<br>messanger to be sent to the "master". We went out to look for clues and the<br>messenger but sadly could not find anything. Eventually we ended up in<br>Greater Faydark where she walking along the path close to Felwhite. We<br>watched her for a minute before she spotted one of us and another<br>conversation started. To sum it up, appearently she was once a high elf and<br>known as a "moon beast". The high priest ordered her to be slain due to her<br>being a moon beast. Her mother, scared for the Khasra's life took Khasra to<br>Lord Mayong Mistmoore to be "saved". However, she was not really saved, but<br>only imprisoned in death for eternity. She hates her foolish mother and<br>seems to want to be a high elf again. She also respects the high elves even<br>though they would kill her if her whereabouts be known. She feels she is<br>obligated to Lord Mistmoore and does what he asks. At the end of this<br>conversation she made us promise not to tell anyone (of course this was all<br>ingame). Darksome later received a "tell" from her stating that she was<br>once again safe within her lord's domains. <br><br>The important part of this event must be the messenger sent to her master,<br>to inform him of Firiona Vie's return and the possibility of the portal<br>opening for Tunare.<br><br>The (edited) log from this event plus screenshots (with the first part of<br>the conversation that is missing from the log) can be found here:<br><br><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~chief/vallis/khasra/">http://www.lysator.liu.se/~chief/vallis/khasra/</a><br><br>Fortune be with you,<br><br>Darksome Greyshadow    <br>55th Half-Elf Ranger    <br>Vallis Scortor          <br>Ayonae Ro               <br><br>Kryonis Sougai<br>55th Human Monk<br>Vallis Scortor<br>Ayonae Ro<br><br>Vallis Scortor - <a href="http://www.vallisscortor.com">http://www.vallisscortor.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

The latest patch issues was the big thing Alan tackled today on the Dev Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000165.html"><b>Charm Change</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: -Prior to the 5/8 patch when I recharmed a mob it immediately went back to it's target. <br><br>-Since the 5/8 patch I always either have to order the pet to attack the previous target, or take a hit. <br><br>-Is this intentional, or a bug? <br><br>Mercuria Cestlavie<br>55 Troubador, The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br>That was intentional, and most certainly something we should have mentioned. Sorry about that. <br><br>Yes, when charm breaks and you re-charm the target, you will have to command it to attack again. We're changing this as part of something larger that is, basically, an exploit. The extra step of hitting the /pet attack macro is something that we had to do to make something else work right. <br><br>Sorry that I can't be more precise, but we're still working on it, and exploit fixes aren't always things we announce.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000164.html"><b>Cleric Imbue Spell</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings! One of the characters I play is a Paineel cleric who worships Cazic Thule. One the character's good friends is an Iksar smith. He has mastered the upper levels of smithing and is now moving into making the imbued class armors, but is having difficulties finding trustworthy people to imbue amber for him. Sadly, my cleric cannot offer this service because there is no imbue spell for her. The imbue amber spell is only useable by shamans and does not seem to take into effect that there are Thulian priests and priestesses. Is there any fix on the horizon for this? I would love to help my friend with his armor, but cannot seem to do so. Nor can I imbue any other gems. Are Thulian clerics to be the only priests without the ability to imbue? <br><br>Thank you in advance for any answers. <br><br>Player of Erinys Dirae<br>Rallos Zek<br>Thulian Priestess ]</i></font><br><br>I may just have to concede my job to Lawrence&#8230; :)<br><br>----------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Thanks for bringing this to our attention! It was always intended for these spell to be cast by Erudite Clerics who worshipped Cazic Thule. The problem was the scroll was not flagged for clerics to be able to scribe it. The scroll has been updated this change should go live next patch. <br>- Lawrence Poe <br>----------------------------<br><br>Thanks Lawrence and Erinys.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000161.html"><b>More On Latest Patch</b></a><br>Dimuyen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just to be clear, *only* tallon and vallon are coming down right? :)]</i></font><br><br>Yes. But everyone will have to download a few small files the first time they log in after the patch. <br><br><br>Hawkeye wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Please explain to me the logic behind faction hits only in starting areas. ]</i></font><br><br>Sure. <br><br>Faction hits are a discouragement to PvP. On the PvP servers anything that discourages PvP should be there for a good reason (after all, these are servers designed specifically for PvP play). <br><br>Faction hits are easily abused in the current system. And faction hits could easily make some quests off limits for a character. We just think that faction hits are too restrictive for those playing in the environment. Limiting faction hits to home towns helps to keep those zones somewhat safer and makes hunting there (if it's fair to call killing sentient citizens 'hunting') more dangerous. If you kill an Ogre in Ogguk, the locals should remember it. But if you catch him out in the desert someplace&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Will you be clearing the factions that are already related to killing players at this time as well? <br><br>Lanath TVyl<br>Vallon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>No. When/If we do that, we'll most certainly announce it loudly. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000154.html"><b>Patch Message</b></a><br>We received a few rather nasty e-mails (and I'm certainly not going to post them&#8230;) about the changes to the faction required to do the Kael and Skyshrine quest. So I asked for a bit more explanation about the change. <br><br>--------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Pretty simple really, players were able to totally ignore factions and still get the rewards entitled to people who chose that faction to serve. Players who worked hard to align themselves with dragons were upset because the giant-lovers could get the skyshrine armor without going to all the effort to change factions. <br><br>Now, as was the intent from the start, players must align themselves with a faction (excluding at least one other) to complete these quests. <br><br>- Steve Burke <br>--------------------<br><br>Yes, you'll have to work harder to get the armors now. We're certainly not happy that we had to change it. But these quests were supposed to be for those loyal to one faction or the other. The reality was that it was too easy to work both sides of the fence. Obviously we should have done this earlier, but that's not an excuse to not do it now. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a request to make:<br><br><br>1) would it be possible to add character names to all of my friends lists at once? Perhaps a switch to the current command? like "/friend Hidari -all" or something similar? <br><br>I know I haven't tested the new friends list out yet, but with the way I use my friends list now I like having the same list for all players, it would be a pain to have to add people to all of my friends lists separately. <br><br>Thanks,<br><br>TheNexus ]</i></font><br><br>We really can't do it that way. It would require reading all of the character.ini files in the directory, determining if there was room for a new entry, adding the name, and writing it out again. This would be a messy operation and would bog you down quite a bit every time you added an entry. <br><br>And do we do this for all your characters? Just the ones on that server? <br><br>Isn't the real value of the friends list to keep track of people that they have grouped with and found to be fun (or efficient&#8230;)? These are going to be characters of similar level to your character (and might only know you as that one character), and a list of them is most relevant to that character. <br><br>Use the new method a while. We think it's much better as it is, and we're not going to fiddle with it until it's been on the servers a while, until people get to try it out. Work with it and see what you think after you've used it a while. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: For the friends list, I'm just curious the reasoning behind making them character specific instead of server specific. I find it to be much more logical that one would have a set of friends per server, and want to know whether those friends are on regardless of what character is being played. <br><br>Also, is it possible now, or could it ever be possible, to have a chat handle on the friends list to see any character under that chat handle? <br><br>e.g. if your chat handle is Absor, then I could /friend #absor or something like that, and if your account was being played, I would see (with maybe a #absor preface) the character you have on. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Brian ]</i></font><br><br>I think I answered the first part of your question earlier. <br><br>As for the chat handles, the answer is no. We won't be showing chat handles in game. We're not going to link all of a person's characters together so anyone doing a /who or /friend will be able to see any character played by one person. Some folks keep separate characters for times when they don't want to be involved with the people they hang out with all the time. I would bet that most of us have an alternate character that we play when we don't want to be bothered. <br><br>If someone hasn't told you that the name of some of their characters, then we're not going to tell either. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "- Some lower 39th and 44th level Velious spells have had their drop rates increased." <br><br>Please clarify what 'lower' means. Does this means the ones that had a lower occurance now have a higher one?<br> <br>Thanks.<br>Merkaba ]</i></font><br><br>No, I can't really clarify it what lower means in that sentence&#8230; <br><br>It's actually just a typo. The original sentence said something about 'lower level spells' and when I changed it to include the specific spell levels, I forgot to take out the word lower. <br><br>Pretend it's not there. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Bugs or undocumented features? <br><br>If you have a bag open from in the bank and you close the bank window, the bag will remain open. You can take stuff out of and put stuff into this bag, and you can walk around the entire zone without it closing. <br><br>Large tailoring kits had a size increase (10 slots instead of 8), does this mean there could be larger sewing recipies comming? <br><br>- Mahkahl ]</i></font><br><br>The bag thing isn't actually new, from what I hear. But we'll fix it when we get the chance. It hovers somewhere between bug and feature. :)<br><br>As for the tailoring kit thing&#8230; it's not a bug. More I can not reveal&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I was wondering, as do most of the Ranger's at the Ranger's Glade, is this haste from the quivers going to stack with Item Haste and Spell Haste? <br>Also, is the resipe for the Fleating Quiver in game? <br><br>Many thanks in advance,<br>RangerD of Tholuxe Paells ]</i></font><br><br>It should stack with other hastes. <br><br>I'll check into the quiver. <br><br>Emmudin_DeMarco wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: It says that 2h pieacers will grey out when used to attack.

And I suppose there really isn't any point in trying to hide where they are&#8230; so how about I pass on an answer to your question? <br><br>----------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I agree and disagree with you. I think this may cause some problems with high level people being in the zone. I don't agree that it will be in the future though. I think in the short term there will be an influx of higher level people in the zone trying to gain faction so they can purchase boots. I think in the future we will see more players of the target level range in the zone building faction while EXPing. <br><br>So to answer your Question: <br><br>I'm not sure if this is the best solution, but I think it's a good one. <br>----------------------------<br><br>And I agree. The vendor needed to be in a place that would make it at least challenging for a 6th level character with thousands of plat handed to them to get the boots, and yet not be too out of the way. This seems to be a great place to put them.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000163.html"><b>Enchanter Spell Ideas</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Barrier of Tashan(50+, level doesn't matter a whole lot), either a self-only or other player castable spell that when they are hit the target loses 1-2 points of magic resist each time. There are pro's and con's for having a self-only or a group member only type spell as well, this would have to be figured. <br><br>Not sure on a name - The Sentinel spell gave me this idea, since Sentinel is completely and utterly useless except when used to lag people out, why not have a spell like this, that when an NPC runs in it would have a chance to mez/stun the NPC for a second and would give you a message that it has trapped something inside. This would be a loved spell in a dungeon environment as you could set it up in one part of the room to help with wanderers. Balancing the spell with fails/level of spell/duration etc would be a different story which I leave up to you. :)<br><br>-Ouden Soulshaper<br>55th Beguiler, Cazic-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Barrier of Tishan is an interesting idea. It's worth giving some thought. At this point I would have to say that if we were to ever put a spell of this type in game, it would have to be self only. I think if an enchanter were to cast this on the primary tank in an epic encounter it would probably get a bit unbalancing. Another issue with the spell in self only form is finding the line between Balanced yet still perceived as useful, and unbalanced/overpowered. <br><br>The trap spell is also a good concept, though I'm not sure if the logistics of making a spell of this type would be feasible for EverQuest. <br><br>Good, solid ideas.

Alan kicked this up <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000161.html">on the Developer's Corner</a> today:<UL>We'll be putting up a small patch tonight to accomplish a few things. We are doing this now because it will be a while until the next patch, and because this will be a very small patch and will require very little downtime. The patch will go in some time in the night tonight.<br><br>We'll be fixing adding the new /consider system to the team PvP servers Tallon and Vallon Zek.<br><br>We'll also be making a change to the way faction hits are given on the team servers. There will be no faction hits taken for killing player characters, with the exception of starting cities and some of the areas surrounding them.<br><br>Killing a character in any of their races home town will cause you to take a faction hit. This counts for all home cities. So, if you kill a Human in any of the city zones of Qeynos, you will suffer a faction hit, even if that Human was born in Freeport. All of Greater Faydark is the starting city for Wood Elves. There will also be faction hits for killing High Elves in Greater Faydark.<br><br>So be aware of these changes. They are part of our continuing PvP changes.<br><br>Alan</UL>

The Harpy's Head Tavern kicked up a new <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/features/standards.jsp">interview with Sony Online Entertainment CEO Kelly Flock</a>.  The questions asked deal with the massively multiplayer genre and other issues along that line.  Here's a clip:<UL><b>Steve Fuller: In your opinion, how do you think SOE has set the standard for the future of massively multiplayer online games (MMOLG) that all other companies would follow with the creation of EverQuest?</b><br><br>Kelly Flock: In several areas. No other game in this genre has experienced the level of updating that goes on in EQ. Everything from expansion packs to new graphics to new quests. The game stays fresh and will continue to be improved. So, any other competitor has to have a plan to ensure ongoing maintenance and development. This will be beyond many publishers and developers. EQ also pioneered the Player vs. Environment model. Before then, Player vs. Player was the rule. It turns out that PvE is a lot more fun. Another area we've spent a lot of time on is in developing and supporting the community, so EQ becomes much more than just a game, but a complete social circle of many players.</UL>

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Enchanters</a>.  Their spells focus on manipulation of the mind, and this mental acuteness gives them more spells than any other class. With spells like Clarity and Charm it's no wonder that Enchanters are sought after by groups all over Norrath. But regenerating mana and charming creatures isn't all that they excell at .. take the test and see how much you know about these mystic snake charmers... <br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the charming mystics of the realms.

These are the latest quotes and excerpts written by Alan on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000150.html"><b>PvP Changes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just dropping you this line to re-assure myself you guys have completely thought these changes through. Especially the de-leveling code.<br><br><br>Since this code went "world wide" (all servers) I wanted to make sure you had thought the change through completely and weren't unintentionally affecting legitimate boosts in stats/skills. I assume we are talking about limits on ATK, Defense, Offense, etc... Some stats like ATK are based on a combination other stats like Offense, weapon skill, str, etc... Now considering that some spells give rather large atk bonuses I just wanted to ask if you guys are sure that the way you are affecting the de-leveling caps won't stomp on legitimate spell/discipline (or beserk I guess) boosts of those skills that may infact put ones skill above the 2 lvl cap.<br><br><br>Adjantis]</i></font> <br><br>Abashi answered most of the questions that came up about these changes. I thought I'd answer this one, since it's just a little different. <br><br>It is only the skill that is capped in code. Items or other such things will continue to add to your skills after the cap. <br><br>We thought of that too. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000156.html"><b>Moving Characters To Other Servers</b></a><br>We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters moved from one server to another, or from one account to another. Unfortunately, due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that we receive, the desire to maintain stable server communities and economies, and other problems associated with character moves, we can not move characters across servers or accounts. <br><br>It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a server remain on that server. We also feel that it is important that characters that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live with the consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to retreat from that reputation by changing servers. <br><br><b>The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving a large number of characters to new servers. At no other time will we move a character in such a fashion. </b><br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000134.html"><b>More Flowing Thoughts...</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The fact is Verant DID make the statement about only allowing bards and enchanters to do mana regen. I remember it. It was during the big fight that occurred after you nerfed the manastone. Arguments were made about giving mana regen to wizards. Verant said they would never do that as it defined the enchanter and bard. I wish I had a copy. oh well. <br><br>Quen ]</i></font><br><br>It sure would be nice if you did have a copy. What you say that we said and what you are upset that you think we said don't match at all. <br><br>I wasn't here then, so I don't know either. But what you say that we said was that Wizards were not going to get a mana regeneration ability, not that we would never give anyone such an ability. <br><br>And, well, in the long run it doesn't really matter how you or we twist what was said in the past. All that really matters is what makes for a better game. <br><br>It would be a bad thing for us to introduce and item or a spell that would reduce the value of the Enchanter and Bardic abilities to give mana back to others. This would be a good principle for us to follow, and I'm pretty sure that we have and will continue to follow that principle. <br><br>Flowing Thought does not reduce the value of the Enchanter or Bardic abilities to give mana back to others, for the reasons I've already stated. <br><br>Sscaley wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: quote: <br><br>It only appears on items found in the Plane of Hate and are no drop. So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this. <br><br>Cazic Thule resides in the Plane of Fear. There is also at least one reward from completing the quests in Temple of Veeshan that results in a buckler with Flowing Thought :). <br><br>Other than that, I applaud that you have taken steps to remedy the abysmal gap between the effect of melee and casters. But it needs some tuning, caster-haste drops from Cazic Thule and melee haste drops from a frenzied ghoul in lower guk, I'd call that a minor discrepancy in risk/reward... ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry, my error there. I get Hate and Fear confused often enough as it is, I should be more careful when I post about them. <br><br>And I would guess that a quest in the Temple of Veeshan would be hard enough to warrant this as a reward&#8230; <br><br>I don't foresee any items with a greater 'caster haste' on them than this one. There are plenty of ways for casters to regain mana faster than natural. If we fill in the gap that you describe (and I think using the word 'abysmal' is an exaggeration), we'll use other methods than caster haste. Keep in mind that mana is used for more than just damage by a caster, where as a melee only does damage with his haste items&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You may not have said anything about never adding mana regen items into the game. But Gordon sure has, on many occasions, stated that mana regen items will never be added to the game as it would be too unbalancing. Here's a quote of his from 8/7/2000: <br><br>"What is with meditation? I've noticed that it is taking forever to med with my skill stuck at 255 (or 252?). We continue to get more mana intensive spells and more mana past the level 50 mark, but I am stuck with the same med capability I will have at level 60 that I had at level 50. So is there a fix proposed for this? How about an item that casts... or has the effect of clarity? If you can do the effect of SoW for J Boots.... why not clarity for another type of item? Seems only fair since the value of SoW is not near what clarity is anymore. <br><br>The 'solution' for what you are mentioning is grouping with classes that have the ability to increase your regen rate. Bards and enchanters can do this for you, and can certainly increase it at a rate beyond what it was at level 50. <br>Putting in other ways to increase mana regeneration would unbalance the game. The methods available to increase the rate of regeneration do so to the greatest extent that we've designed for the game. <br><br>- Gordon "<br><br>Gotta love those news archives at Caster's Realm!! He followed up on it on 8/8/2000 restating the same thing. So, to conclude, yes Verant has stated on numerous occasions that there would NEVER be any mana regeneration items added to the game as it would be too unbalancing, and yes Verant has gone back on their word by adding this item with Flowing Thought, no matter how minimal the effect is on mana regen. Just thought you should know. <br><br>Miladian 'the rat saver' Dratsaver<br>Xev ]</i></font><br><br>Ah, an actual quote. Thanks. <br><br>Let me update that statement then. <br><br>We certainly don't anticipate adding any effects that would increase mana regeneration greater than that of Flowing Thought, though it most certainly might happen. <br><br>And even should it happen, it won't be done in any way that reduces the value of the classes that can currently increase mana regeneration. And it will not be done as a method of increasing damage output for casters (other methods will be found, increasing mana regeneration does not target any specific weakness of a caster class, it improves all casting abilities of that class). <br><br>So, I guess I accept that we did once say that we would never do what we did. But I'm so overwhelmed by the volume of concern over this one extremely weak effect that I'm shocked anyone would be upset over it. <br><br>And, you know what, if we need to do something to make the game better, it won't matter that we said we wouldn't do it in the past, we'll do it anyway. <br><br>Look at these rather recent changes and tell me that you think we shouldn't have made them because we might have said that we never would: <br><br>Removal of Hybrid experience penalties.<br>Divine Aura line of spells prevents stunning.<br>More Bind points. <br><br>And I'm sure that there are many others, those are just the three that were at the top of my head at the moment. <br><br>I see no point in continuing to argue about this. The effect of Flowing Thought has no negative impact on any class, as it stacks with EVERY mana regenerating spell, and is a positive thing for all casters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Oh no! <br><br>You said that the bard has a class defining ability to "play the mana song"! ... Ohh, you'll get flamed for this, i'm sure. :)<br><br>/hug Absor <br><br>Delphi Aegis, Paladin of Thudner<br>47th Storm of Karana<br>Quellious Server ]</i></font><br><br>Shouldn't you be playing a mana song instead of pestering me? <br><br>:)<br><br>/em runs from all the bards in the world<br>/em realizes that they are all faster than he is<br>/sit<br>/camp desktop<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000082.html"><b>Plane of Mischief</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Is it possible to make these items one time trade-able only in the POM? Meaning you make the item and trade it to a member of the raid party. If you zone out of POM before trading the item, you are stuck with it. It would be similar to the keys in POA that disappear when you zone out with the keys on your body. Only you don't lose the item. <br><br>This would solve the problem of making an item you can't use. <br><br>Barfli<br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br><br>Sure, it's possible to do that. <br><br>But we've come up with another solution. I'm not going to outline it, because, well, it's complicated and you'll have to figure it out on your own. But, basically, there is a way to use the no-drop items to get other items that will get you other stuff that you can keep, or use to get other stuff they suits your class better&#8230; <br><br>Or something like that. <br><br>Basically, the items will be no-drop, but you'll be able to get something that you can use if you do more convoluted things within the zone.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000108.html"><b>Alan: Ruler of Time & Space</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Since you're now the ruler of all time and space, please make Mondays go away and just add a second Saturday ;p <br><br>Kiriani<br>Saryrn]</i></font> <br><br>I would do that, but I've given myself all Sundays.

I probably should have changed this one, though. It is a bit misleading.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing For Experience, Part 2</b></a><br>Paynnne wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: paraphrased quote since it's too late to cut and paste :)<br><br>I don't know if we'll ever have a quest that would yield a bub of exp in level 40. <br><br>Why not? If it takes a few hours of camping in LGuk to get a yellow bub, why couldn't there be a once in a lifetime quest that would take a few hours and yielded a yellow bub? Until then questing will always be for items or faction. As it stands no one does questing for exp except for the low level ones like deathfist belts. The emphasis will still be on hack and slash (read - camping in this game) for exp. Why can't questing be as fruitful as camping? ]</i></font><br><br>Well, how do you know that a quest is going to be as much 'effort' as camping LGuk for a few hours? Obviously the easy way is to make it so that the quest requires that you camp in LGuk for a few hours&#8230; <br><br>The trick is to find a way to judge the value of a task by a measure other than time spent or difficulty of NPC killed.

The latest message is now live on the Patch Server:<UL><b>May 8th, 3:00 am</b><br>------------------------------<br><br><br>** PvP changes **<br><br>We have made the first of our upcoming changes to the PvP aspects of EverQuest:<br> <br>- Consider:  /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character.  The <br>character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him.  The character<br> will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack.  And the character will show as<br> 'red' if he is above your range.  This will only take effect on PvP servers.<br><br>- Sanctuary Levels:  Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they<br> take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.  This will, obviously, only take place on PvP servers.<br><br>- De-Leveling:  Characters that lose levels will only retain the combat skills of a character two <br>levels higher.  This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character <br>will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character.  This change will apply to <br>all servers (it has to, code-wise).  So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people <br>that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), <br>while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find <br>themselves at no great advantage.<br><br>These are the first of the things that we plan to.  We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach <br>to changes whenever we can, and we have other changes planned for upcoming patches.<br><br><br><br>** Quest Changes **<br><br>-  We've made a change to the Velious armor quests.  The folks in Kael and in Skyshrine that give <br>out rewards for these quests are now being stricter about who they will reward quest items to.  You <br>will have to be considered an 'ally' (see Features section below) by these NPCs in order to be able <br>to complete these quests.  If you are doing quests for the Coldain, however, they are somewhat less <br>picky, and they only require that they consider you 'kindly' to reward you for your labors.<br><br>- The Black Silk Cape will now drop more frequently.<br><br><br>** Bug Fixes **<br><br>- Attacking with a two-handed piercing weapon will now 'gray-out' the attack button as it should.<br><br>- Text that once read: "You cannot remove this affect." now reads "You cannot remove this effect."  <br>Changed by popular demand... :)<br><br>- Food Emotes:  Forcing your character to eat by right clicking food will now properly display the <br>appropriate emote to those in the area.<br><br>- Fixed a problem that often made it difficult to loot really large NPCs.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- The Shield of Tsunami can now be equipped in the secondary slot.<br><br>- Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows, the better the quiver the faster your bow.  We will not <br>be listing the speed increase a quiver will give your bow, but you can tell the good quivers by their <br>ability to reduce the weight of your arrows (better-made or magical quivers have this property).<br><br>- The Ivory Handled Falchion should now 'proc' without telling you that it is out of charges.  You <br>may need to contact your GM to replace the item with a new version if it is still acting strangely.<br> <br>- The Opal Bracelet is now a wrist item, not a finger item.  Be aware, once you remove it from your <br>finger, it will not go back onto that finger, it will only fit on your wrists, as it should.<br><br>- The Large Dragonbone Shard will no longer appear to be a Staff of the Gathering.<br><br>- The Ring of Levitation will now poof when all the charges are used up, and should display the <br>correct number of charges.<br><br>- The Priceless Velium Reinforced Bow now has a range of 200 instead of a range of 0.<br><br>- The Refined Mithril Blade should now be equipable in both primary and secondary slots.<br><br>- The Unicorn Horn should now have a graphic.<br><br>- The Hammer of Flattening has been changed from tiny to large.  This might cause you a little <br>reorganization in your inventory.<br><br>- Runebranded Stone Buckler is now labeled as a shield and can be used to bash.<br><br>- The Ring of Pureblood is now a finger item, not a waist item.<br><br><br>** Spell Changes and Additions **<br><br>- Translocation spells:  Five new Wizard 'push' spells have been added (Translocate: Fay, Tox, <br>North, Combine and Group).  Translocate spells send the group to the location, while the Wizard <br>remains behind.  Translocate Group sends everyone in the group (except the Wizard) to their own <br>bind points.  Translocate Group can be found on NPCs in Velious (and they won't give them up easily).  The others are available on an exclusive vendor.  All Translocate spells (even the original Translocate) have confirmation boxes that must be accepted before the target will be sent.  And Wizards can no longer Translocate themselves.<br><br>- Some lower 39th and 44th level Velious spells have had their drop rates increased.<br><br>- GM Resurrection has had it's name changed from ResurrectionGM to Customer Service Resurrection so <br>that players will be able to better tell when they are getting a resurrection from the GM staff. GM <br>resurrection will no longer have Res effects, and will leave the newly Ressed with full Hit Points <br>and Mana.<br><br>- Divine Aura and spells of that type (Divine Aura - cleric, Divine Barrier - cleric, Kazumi's Note <br>of Preservation - bard, Harmshield - necromancer, Quivering Veil of Xarn - necromancer) will now <br>prevent the caster from being stunned when hit for their duration.<br><br>- The Eye of Zomm series of spells will no longer work in Kedge Keep.  This change was made to <br>prevent an exploit.<br><br> <br>** Feature Additions and Changes **<br><br>- Looting text has been changed.  You will now see a -- before and after any loot messages.  This <br>has been changed primarily to help prevent any fake looting messages from being thought of as real.<br><br>- When you loot an item, you will receive a text message telling you what you have just looted.<br><br>- Expanded Friends List:  The Friends List will now hold 30 character names.  And each character has <br>its own friends list.  You can find and edit this list with a text editor, if you need to, outside <br>the game.  You can locate the text files in your EverQuest directory.  The files will look like <br>this:  <character name>_<#>.ini.  The default Friends List for existing and new characters will be <br>your old Friends List.<br><br>- The destroy or drop item confirmation box will now close if you accidentally pick up another item <br>while they are open.  This should prevent accidentally deleting or dropping the wrong item.<br><br>- When selling to a merchant, you can no longer sell items that are inside a container by having the <br>container selected and clicking the sell button.  The merchant will tell you that you need to empty <br>the container before the merchant will buy it.  This should prevent folks from accidentally selling <br>items that they did not know were in those containers.<br><br>- You can now move items around inside containers that are in the bank.<br><br>- There is a new /consider message: "regards you as an ally".  This is the highest level of <br>friendliness that an NPC will register using the /consider command.  The faction required to reach <br>this rating is significantly higher than 'warmly'.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Fresh from the Developer's Corner, here is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000142.html"><b>Guide Application</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The guide application doesn't actually have you send your password in plain text... it has you log in. However, this could be made clearer on the application, to avoid confusion. <br><br>- Xelene Solyric ]</i></font><br><br>Right. The form is secure, and the information for your login name and password are checked by the same method we use to check your login to the game. <br><br>It's good that people are worried about the security on our site, and the seeming contradiction about the password thing. <br><br>You know the site is valid because you got the URL from our main site. We ask for a validation of your EverQuest account to ensure that you actually play the game. I'll mention to the people in charge that they might make that clear on the site, thanks. <br><br>And several people have filled out the application only to lose all that information when their browser crashes. That's not fun. Whenever typing something long and complicated to be placed into an e-mail or a browser, I always type it up in a word processor first. This means I won't lose it if something happens to the browser, and I can spell check it before I let others see it. <br><br>Just a suggestion.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000153.html"><b>Stormfeather</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Players have timed this guy to a 19 hour spawn who sometimes skips. This, combined with Lodizal (an even rarer spawn) make it almost impossible to complete the Iceland map quest without days of mindless, boring waiting. I've heard reports of players sitting for 80 plus hours waiting for this guy. The quest already has one bottleneck with Lodizal as players must be lucky enough to be in on the kill, and also win the roll. The Stormfeather thing is excessive. Why should we have to sit around for countless hours to complete a quest? Could you maybe look into upping the spawn time, or perhaps at least change it from skipping spawns? <br><br>Slaede <br>52 Rogue<br>Vallon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>Here's more information from the team: <br>------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>While I didn't personally design the quest I have assisted players in it's completion with my play character. One friend doggedly camped the spawn location for over two days straight before obtaining the component it carries. Another friend put a bounty out for players who were hunting the normal spawns in the area, he paid a generous sum to the first person to tip him off when the creature appeared. I guess it's up to you how you want to play the game and how important each particular item is to your character. <br><br>It's a random spawn, not timed, and as you pointed out it can be very rare. The quest yields arguably the best facepiece in the game so I don't predict a reduction in the difficulty of obtaining it. <br><br>As a team I know we're committed to pushing the envelope in regards to what we can pull off contentwise. I feel we've made some significant enhancements lately that will enable us to provide even more compelling content in the near future. <br><br>- Steve Burke <br>-------------------------<br>Thanks for the response, Steve.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Questing For Experience</b></a><br>Relbeek wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm one of those strange players who gets more joy out of doing quests than out of camping. <br><br>In fact, on a lark, I did as little camping as possible during level 39 to see how well I would do getting most of my XP questing. It took me three weeks to get to level 40, 75% of my XP came from quests, and I got five pieces of Ro armor (I play a druid, so I gave the armor to a paladin friend) to boot.<br> <br>Certainly it can't be argued that if XP is what you're after that you should quest if you're any higher than your teens. And even the XP bearing quests for low levels tend to involve lots of camping for things like runnyeye beads, deathfist slashed belts, crushbone belts, and the ubiquitous bone chips. <br><br>What I'd like to see are quests yielding significant XP for higher level people - even people in their 40s and 50s. Quests that don't necessarily yield you a useful item but which will yield you enough experience to make questing a viable alternative to, say, camping the Lord Room in Lower Guk. <br><br>Now I realize the exploitable nature of quests that yield larger amounts of experience, so let me pose to you a few "catches" to help: <br><br>- Make the quest involve the retrieval of several NO DROP items, that are combined in a container to yield another NO DROP item, which is turned into the questgiver for your reward. This prevents multiquesting. <br><br>- Make eligibility for doing any given quest be based on the level of the questing PC. A quest that would yield half a bubble of experience to a level 46 character could simply be made not available to anyone under, say, 40th level. <br><br>- If you don't set eligibility requirements, make the reward based on the questing PC's level, with a 'hard ceiling'. IE it would yield a bubble of experience to a 41st level char, and would yield a bubble of experience to a 20th level character, but would yield the same number of experience points to anyone 41st level and up (meaning a 45th level character would only get a third of a bubble or so.) <br><br>With options like these in place, you could satiate the desires of those of us who truly enjoy 'questing' more than we do sitting in a group in a camp. What do you think? ]</i></font><br><br>An inspiring comment from Steve Burke, one of our designers. <br>------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Hi Relbeek, <br><br>After reading your email I think you're either a bit psychic or you've had our meeting room bugged. <br><br>Seriously, we've had a few discussions lately that have resulted in some changes being made. These changes will enable us to implement some of the suggestions you've made here, as well as some not mentioned such as quests that players can only do once in their lifetime. <br><br>We're all working on creating more original, compelling content with enticing rewards. <br><br>- Steve Burke <br>-------------------------<br>As is my duty, I have to interject a little voice of caution into this. I wouldn't expect to see a bunch of new quests pop up tomorrow with all of these features. Nobody knows better than Steve that quests take a lot of time to design (good ones, anyway). But we're all for original content and awesome quests, and we're working to improve our ability to design and implement better and more interesting quests. <br><br>I don't know that there would ever be a quest that would yield a full bubble of experience for a character in their 40s, though. But we the general concepts you propose are certainly things that we've been thinking about lately.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000151.html"><b>Theft of Thought</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I figured i jump in with a spell question (hope Mr. Poe isnt to busy atm =) <br><br>Im using ToT on mobs one common thing seems to happen, the higher level the mob the less you receive back into your mana pool. <br><br>I can understand this from a resist point of view or whatever (personally i would rather it be a stable amount like harvest), but my question is this; <br><br>Does the gain back into ones mana bar refloect how much was taken from the mob? Or do you always take a set amount from the mob, its just how much you receive that is level dependant? <br><br>Thanks <br><br>And go Lakers!!! <br><br>A_Laker_Fan_01 <br><br>=) ]</i></font><br><br>-----------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Theft of Thought takes a set amount of Mana from your target and returns it to you. This amount scales up as you level. The numbers will be the same for both sides, meaning if you take 100 mana from the target you will get 100 mana. The mana stolen, and the mana returned are both level dependant. <br><br>W00p Go Lakers ^_^<br> <br>- Lawrence Poe <br>---------------------<br>I feel like I missed the secret Laker-friends hand signal&#8230; <br><br>:)</UL>
