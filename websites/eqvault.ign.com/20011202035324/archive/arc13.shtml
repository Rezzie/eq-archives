A couple of updates were made by Alan today on the Developer's Corner.  Here's the skinny:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html"><b>Roleplay Server</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Your mention of enchanters/bards/rogues brings up an interesting point... <br><br>If I'm a High Elf Enchanter and I cast Illusion: Troll, can I then group with members of Evil races? If so, wouldn't it be rather easy for me to learn their languages? By "easy" I mean that I wouldn't have to find a Neutral person who had learned their languages. I could just join the Evil group and my language skills would improve steadily until I could understand what was being said. <br><br>Then again: I imagine that until you're fairly good at their language, it would be difficult (if not impossible) to find an Evil group who would take you as a member. I know I'd be pretty frustrated if someone joined up who could not communicate with anyone else in the group. <br><br>AND, imagine the surprise of the poor Troll who joins an "Evil" group, only to find out that it's a bunch of Good bards/rogues/enchanters! And him not even able to eat them all, due to it not being a PvP server. 8( <br><br>Just some stuff to think about... <br><br>Nocturne Somnus -Socratic Method- ]</i></font><br><br>While that sounds like and intriguing idea, I don't think it can be done. <br><br>The ability to group with other is going to have to be based on some sort of information, probably an alignment, that is calculated from existing information (race, class, deity). It's unlikely that this information will be stored on the character. So there won't be a way to change it by a spell. <br><br>And it also leads to all sorts of problems. For example, what happens when your illusion goes down? <br><br>While I like the idea conceptually, I don't think it's going to be practical. <br><br>Slugworth wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: GROUP TO PORT? DARK ELF WIZARD? <br><br>I am really new to Everquest and I am having a BLAST! The discussion of the Roleplaying server excites me, but I have a quick question. Again I am new to this, so take it with a grain of salt. <br><br>Dont you have to be grouped with a Wizard or Druid to be able to teleport or evacuate? If that is true and you DO have to be grouped, I can see a problem. <br><br>As far as I know non of the evil races can be Druids, therefore the only race/class combination able to teleport any evil group would be a Dark Elf Wizard. That could turn into a bit of a problem. <br><br>Thanks. ]</i></font><br><br>You're correct. An 'evil' character might not be able to obtain the services of a druid. <br><br>But they might. If we allow druids to be neutral, and if we allow evils and neutrals to group, then there won't be a problem. <br><br>But I really doubt that such a thing will be a big consideration on this server. If a necromancer can't rely on a nature worshipper to do favors for him, that's fine in a roleplaying environment. The necromancer has alternatives, not the least of which are evil wizards. <br><br>On this server we may very well sacrifice some 'convenience' things in favor of roleplaying things. That's really the whole point. But we may also make exceptions (like summon corpse &#8211; this spell helps players solve stuck corpse issues), but convenience might not take priority over setting on this server. <br><br>Sengan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just a couple of quick comments on a few things Absor responded to: <br><br>Having a /say component to group chat would be a very bad idea. First, things that are said to the group are often private and having others hear could reveal things you didnt wish them to hear (strategies for example), or things that are fine with your group but not necessarily fine with those who might listen in (swearing for example). In addition, if the group was not one who's language you spoke the /say component would simply be extremely, make that EXTREMELY, annoying spam. Even if you DID speak their language but weren't interested in what they had to say, it would be extremely annoying spam. <br><br>On the idea that the server will create insular groups by race, I would tend to agree. Where I disagree though is that these groups would ever, even at high levels become less insular. The people you start playing with are generally the people you tend to stay playing with. By having the races be insular for the low to even mid levels, you increase the likelihood that they will remain that way for the entire time they play the game. I dont think there is any sort of guarantee that things wont remain insular. This will create some problems if it is the case. <br><br>Somewhere along the line Absor responded (sorry didnt copy the exact point) that the "real fix is that players get along". Sounds great, but you are putting up a whole lot of barriers to that which you hope people will get around. How do you get along with someone you cant talk to?? Answer is you dont. As far as you are concerned they are playing a different game in another universe. You cant talk to them, they cant tell you what they want, you cant tell them what you want, you cant agree to share a spawn, you can only fight over it. You cant enforce any sort of play nice (not sure if you intended to anyway though on a PvE sever I would guess you did). Even if someone can speak the other groups language they dont have to admit they can. I can just see the fight over Ragefire as there are 6 groups all speaking different languages and none willing to in any way do anything other than fight for the spawn and then claim kill stealing if the didnt get it.<br>The barriers you will create with the programming pretty much make "the real fix is players that players get along" a very very iffy thing. ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, the say component to group say could be a huge pain in the behind. The spam might be enough of a reason to not do it. <br><br>But if you're talking bad about someone, or strategizing against them, then you probably should move out of their hearing range. <br><br>If people stick to their own race for their entire lives on this server, that would be great! If they choose to branch out in order to accomplish things that they can't accomplish with their own people, that's fine too. If something that they want to do is out of reach, then the troll band can link up with some inkies to get it done. That's all a very good thing on a roleplaying server. <br><br>Players know what's going on. They know when they are kill stealing, they know when someone wants to share a spawn. And, as I said before, we're not going to make it impossible to learn other languages, just hard. People will do it. And you may very well want that <class that nobody invites into their groups, ever> along with you, if he can speak a few extra languages to help you negotiate with the locals.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000241.html"><b>Sullon Zek Update</b></a><br>Hi there. I have an update from Hobart for you all. <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I think there has been a little confusion about what I meant when I said "looting rights". <br><br>Here is a recap of the paragraph that is causing confusion: <br><br><i>"We will be also changing the way PvP experience loss works on Sullon. The current problem is that a high level player can repeatedly kill lower level players without risk. The higher level player can continue to harass these lower level players without risk of experience or coin loss for any amount of time. While one could use the same argument that the lower level players are also losing nothing, we feel there should be some innate risk with a higher level player bottom feeding these lower level players. With this change, it will make higher level players think twice before attacking low level players. This will also give groups of lower level players an incentive to group up and take on higher level adversaries. So we intend to change the rules so that any character killed by a lower level character will lose experience. Along with the experience loss, the killing person will be given looting rights also." </I><br><br>Here is some clarification: <br><br>Many people have expressed the concern of twinking kills to lower level players. They would do this by taking a higher level character and beating down an opponent. Then letting a much lower level character get the final blow. Thus, the looting rights. While this can certainly happen, it is still the case where only coin can be looted. And, in this special case of experience loss being caused outside the + or - 5 level limit, a deity insignia would NOT be generated. The insignia's will remain only for those kills within a + or - 5 level limit. <br><br>We could take this even another step back and say there are NO looting rights and just experience is lost. I am even open to more suggestions on how we keep high level players from (I can't think of another word besides grieving?) lower level players. <br><br>While I have the time, I wanted to address some more thoughts on this. <br><br>Bards and boats - We will definitely remove songs at first. And yes, this will most likely happen across all servers. If anyone can think of any problems this would cause, please let us know. <br><br>Evil Vs Evil? - This is more of a probe to see what players think about the idea. That's why we threw it out to you to chew on. But I can assure you that it hasn't been ruled out 100%. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "Conclusion: I really think Sullon Zek is a GREAT idea, but I see these certain aspects of the game as unbalancing, easily manipulated to favor certain people (not exploits mind you, just poor PvP planning for the world as a whole). <br><br>As the server is now, it is far more discouraging than fun, especially for light races playing evil chars and dark races playing good/neutral classes. They are just too thinly spread in their starting zones/areas/cities and the lack of binders in the surrounding areas and cities makes it even more discouraging. Upon hitting level 6 they are just bait and the lack of numbers means there is no way in which they can amass a small army for vengeance as they are far too outnumbered." ]</i></font><br><br>The poster did not give a name for the above text. <br><br>One thing to remember. EverQuest was not made with PvP in mind. So when servers like the Zek's come out, it is very hard to balance everything in regards to PvP. We don't have the resources to go through all the old world content and rebalance it for PvP. With Sullon, we have made some exceptions and have begun implementing quests that only appear on this server. We also did some changes with the race class combinations found on this server to help attempt to balance things. <br><br>As for the server being more discouraging then fun, everyone has a different thought on the "FUN" aspect of the server. Hopefully over time, and time permitting, we will be able to add more fun aspects to the server. <br><br>PvP Immunity update: <br><br>The changes made for the PvP Immunity for players under 6 is in its QA phase. Here are the details on what has been done. <br><br>These zones will continue to protect players below level 6 from PvP combat. <br><br>Steamfont, Nektulos, Qeynos Hills, Everfrost, Tox, Misty Thicket, East Commons, Innothule Swamp, Feerrott, Butcher, Field of Bone, Swamp of No Hope, Warsliks Wood, Lake of Ill Omen and all City Zones (the zones where faction hits will take place). <br><br>When entering another zone, it will indicate that you are no longer immune from PvP. <br><br>/Con: <br><br>You may also notice that we slipped in new con messages for the Neutral Alliance. They can now tell whether their opponent is evil or good aligned. This should allow for neutral alliance to make alliances with another alliances more easily. <br><br>Hobart Wolfkin<br>Barbarian Warrior<br>The Tribunal <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Thanks for the update, Hobart. </UL>

The intent is to create trade skills that are profitable when items are sold to other players, allowing (forcing) them to deal with other people to make their money. <br><br>And your 20pp per hour estimate is, well, shamefully low. That, or you don't click as fast as some other people&#8230; <br><br>Yes, we were prompted to change this by what we saw on Sullon Zek. Discovering that people could fund blacksmithing fine plate within three days of the server opening using this one baking recipe exclusively was what brought it to our attention. But we would have changed it no matter how it was brought to our attention. The prices were not in line with the goals we have for trade skills. <br><br>There's nothing sinister here. We want people to make money trading their home made goods to players, not to merchants.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html"><b>Lot of RP Server Feedback</b></a><br>Rilauven wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi, I've recently gotten back into EQ and just heard about the Rolepaying Server ideas. Overall I think it's a great idea and I'll definately be making a character there when it goes up, but a couple things worry me. <br><br>First is the langauge barriers. In concept, they're an excellent idea to encourage RP and racial differences. However, I've played on many mud & mush's with language code in place and the reality is that it tends to be a very frustrating detriment to rp. A typical conversation usually goes like this: <br><br>Human: Hello!<br>Elf: vgbbz!<br>Human: what?<br>Elf: Y gfan, Vgbbz!<br>Human: Huh??<br>Elf: hgn'y ubq klaop gntbxzy!?!<br>Human: what the heck are you saying!? <br><br>(At this point both parties give up and go off to roleplay with members of their own race) <br><br>I'd suggest putting a common tounge that's easy to learn even at low levels. Or at the very least, leave in the /ooc channel. Which brings be to the second point. The /ooc channel should be left in! Partially for the reason above, so people have some chat system in place, even if it's just ooc. Groups of friends need a way to find each other to roleplay together. Without an ooc channel, they have no choice but to wander around and hope they bump into someone interesting. This is what the /ooc channel should be for. In the event that this doesn't happen anyway, will we at least have /tell and guildchat that can break language barriers? <br><br>I understand that there needs to be some kind of rule/understanding that ooc, tells and guildchat are strictly ooc, but if ooc communication is taken out completely, it will make finding prefered people to roleplay and group with very, very difficult! Please take these points into condsideration, and thank you for your time. ]</i></font><br><br>You said something that went *ding* for me. <br><br>------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>(At this point both parties give up and go off to roleplay with members of their own race)<br>------------------------------------<br><br>Actually, that's rather the goal of language restrictions. Races in Norrath are rather insular. We want people to spend their lower levels dealing primarily with people of their own species. This promotes community among the races and means that those that can communicate with others outside their race have spent the time and effort to do so. This is exactly what we're looking for. <br><br>Sure, some people will find it frustrating that they have trouble grouping with and communicating with people outside their species. That's unfortunate. But, just like many of our alternate rules servers, the idea here is to make things different in order to promote certain play styles. Here we want to make it harder for people that don't care about the race they have chosen to play as much as they care about getting experience in the most efficient group. <br><br>So, at least in this area, frustrating is just fine. :)<br><br>Choadian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Something that popped into my mind as a potential problem which may escalate to GM/Guide involment is this: How to two groups which don't have a common method of communication work out who is fighting what in an certain location? <br><br>For example lets say you have two groups in Dalnir's, one, all Iksar, are fighting lumpy goos and the other, all non-evil and fresh off the boat wish to hunt nearby. How do they work out things like sharing an area, avoiding trains, how long a group is going to be in a particular area, etc? With no civilized method of working this out ahead of time you're very quickly going to have accidental (?) violations of the Play nice policy. Of course there is always /wave /point and /rude to fall back on. ]</i></font><br><br>Good point. That's something we'll have to figure out. Though I suspect that by the time anyone is fighting in Dalnir's at least one member of each group will know a language that a member of the other group knows. But we will certainly have to look at this issue when it comes time to decide on the customer service aspects of the server. <br><br>Furloaf wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I am wondering how some of the out of character commands will be dealt with on this new server. One that comes to mind is the /location command. Most often this command is used as a cheap guide to easily find an area or place, that is supposed to be hard to find. Limiting this command in some way I think would encourage role-playing, as players will ask other players for help to reach a destination they aren't familiar with. Completely removing the command may not be the best action, because it is very helpful in locating specific area bugs inside a zone. Maybe perhaps limiting the amount of times the /location command can be used in a time period, i.e. adding a "recast" time to the command, like Lay on Hands. Another idea that springs up from the limitation of /location, is to allow Rangers to use the command, or perhaps the classes that can Track. The ability (lowering of the "recast" time) to use /location could be based off of the Track skill. <br><br>Other out of character commands I am wondering about deal with communication. Specifically the Inter-zone and long distance means of communicating. Tell and Guild Chat being the most extreme. These two, as well as Group Chat, from a role-playing perspective make no sense. These commands are hard to recommend changes to. Here roleplaying may have to be bent so that gameplay does not suffer. I myself an unsure on Tells and Guildchat. Group say might be able to change to a more roleplay fashion, without harming gameplay. I envision it not being limited to the members of the group, able to be heard by all around. The area of it will be the same as shout. The difference being that the members of the group would retain the chat color set for /group, so to not make it more difficult for players to group together. <br><br>I am eagerly looking forward to this new proposed server. Please look over my concerns, and do your best to answer. Thanks. ]</i></font><br><br>Some good points. I don't think we discussed /loc at all. I'll bring that up. As far as I'm concerned, we don't need it on the RP server. People can navigate by landmarks, and where there aren't landmarks they can get lost&#8230; I'll circulate the /loc thing around and see what the team thinks. <br><br>/tell we talked about extensively. Honestly, it's just too useful to remove. People are still playing EverQuest as a game. Many folks will just want to chat with a friend when on line. /tell let's them do that. And sometimes, just for the sake of gameplay, you need to talk to someone on the other side of Norrath. <br><br>I'm personally indifferent on guild chat. I see it as a totally ooc channel for friends to babble at each other over. I've heard suggestions that we limit guild chat to city zones only, to sort of represent the guild house, where they can gather and chat&#8230; but I don't see that. <br><br>But I really like your group chat idea. I've always been bothered by seeing groups of people sitting around in zen lotus positions just staring at each other. It's kind of creepy. It's even creepier when you know that they're chatting to each other mentally while they're at it. <br><br>So adding a /say component to group chat is a brilliant idea. Heck, some of the funniest things I've ever heard have been said over group chat, and it's a shame that everyone in the area didn't get to hear them&#8230; <br><br>Thanks for the ideas. <br><br>This next one is long, so I'll respond within the text. <br><br>CohibaAl wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I sent this in yesterday to the Dev Comment link, not sure if that was the correct one to post to.

Please bear with me on the lengthy comments! :)<br><br>The situation you have then would be that items couldn't be farmed by higher levels since the magic items wouldn't drop, yet could be bought from the lower level player that does get it. It sounds great! But for some quest items, the natural rarity of the item, combined with the much more limited pool of possible players to achieve it, would skyrocket the price of many items. This may look good for helping the young players make some money, but with the WLC and the absense of farming the platinum resources of most players would be significantly reduced. ]</i></font><br><br>If items become more rare on this server, I see that as a good thing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Let me give an example to outline this. In my experience I hate farming, worse I hate selling in G-bay (Greater Faydark). So I have sold maybe 4 or 5 items in my whole career total. I have a 50 paladin, a 46 druid, and all total I just now have 4k plat in the bank. Let's pretend this isn't an unreasonably low amount for someone who has played as long as I have, under your new coding. <br><br>1) I have a mid-level druid under the new server. I decide I would like to get a --quest item in question-- (which sells on Tunare for 5k or so). However I don't have 5k or more to buy one outright, and my ability to make money is limited as I can't "farm" anything to sell in order to raise the cash. I start anyway. I hunt in --some place-- and get --item #1--, --item #2--, and --item #3--. I move to --another place-- to camp --some NPC-- for the ---item#4-- only to discover in frustration and dismay (after 5 hours of sitting) that --some NPC-- is green and doesn't drop --item#4-- for me. This worsens my disgust of "evercamp" as any such time spent is now at risk of producing nothing. ]</i></font><br>Examples edited out&#8230; no spoilers here! :)  So you have to buy <item #4> from someone of the appropriate level to get it. I don't see that as an issue. You might even be encouraged to help them hunt in <another place> for a while so they can get it. That's a good thing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2) I look to buy --item #4-- that a lower level has gotten. Supply and demand shows that there really aren't many lower level players that are looking for --item #4-- and so it isn't really camped by them. This drives the price UP (currently --item #4-- alone can sell for 1k). An enterprising young camper realizes this and camps and loots the ring. Supply and demand state he can ask a considerably higher price for it, as most all -class- want a <quest item in question> at some time but only a small level range of players can get --item #4--, and thus there are far fewer available.]</i></font><br> <br>As I said, it's not a bad thing if items become more rare on this server. In fact, I'd call it a good thing. Players on this server might have to adjust and accept that just because they want <quest item in question> does not mean that they will ever get it. I would love to see a server where the items that people think of as 'required' are sometimes just not obtainable. People will quickly discover that those items aren't as indispensable as they think they are. And people that have such items will be that much more unique. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3) Economics shows that he could easily sell for an asking price outside of my range. he would end up selling to a level 55 or 60 player that has access to such a powerful pool of loot to sell or trade, or just more mobs that drop larger amounts of coin. I really wouldn't be able to afford <item #4> and complete my quest until I was nearly at the end-game. ]</i></font><br><br>If that becomes true, then that item is end-game (if you must use that term) loot. If people at 55+ level think it's good enough to buy for their own use, then maybe it should be something that they can't afford until they are higher level&#8230; <br><br>But, most likely people will just be more careful, and make sure to get the quest components for items they know they will want when they are of the appropriate level to get it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4) Enough examples of this and players become very discouraged at questing. Especially the ones that want to experience the game WITHOUT the use of spoiler sites listing the exact levels required to do quests, the ones that want to discover the game on their own as you originally designed it.]</i></font><br> <br>That is a problem. But the problem is that folks think they 'need' stuff that they've read about on spoiler sites, or that their character on some other server has. That's just not the case. It's certainly easier to defeat enemies with better arms and armo(u)r, but it's certainly not required that you have all the best stuff to do anything in EverQuest. Again, maybe this is something that folks playing on this server will have to learn if they want to play there. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I really do see the prices for many quest items skyrocketing out of the range for anyone but the very high levels to attain. This plan would handicap people; prevent them from playing the game as it was intended and worsening the schism between rich uber players and poor average players. Hill Giants would become very very scarce just because they are a mid-level source of money needed to purchase. ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry, but maybe you and I disagree on 'as it was intended'. Powerful items being rare and expensive isn't against any part of 'as it was intended' that I know about&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: THE SOLUTION: make nearly every item NO-DROP! With the exception of player made items, and other things specifically made to be traded, all items being No-Drop would ALSO: <br><br>a) PREVENT FARMING, bottom-feeding or the rest of the goals that your WLC has attempted to fix. No more level 60's farming their 15th FBSS, it's no drop. No more level 60's farming Yakesha swords, they are no drop. This may stabilize the server economy as well. ]</i></font><br><br>You're not exactly correct. It would just produce a different kind of farming. Let's say that a high level character (or guild) wants to get some stuff for his lower level friends or guild members. Rather than bottom feeding the stuff solo, he'll just bring his lower level friends into the zone and have them loot the stuff. Slightly more complicated, but certainly not hard. There would be no less bottom feeding or farming, there would just be more people sitting around watching it happen. The anti-bottom feeding code actually prevents bottom feeding altogether by making it nearly impossible. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: b) SOLVE LOOT DISPUTES. No more hassle over why wizards are randoming warrior equipment or why warriors are randoming caster stuff, it's all no-drop. ]</i></font><br><br>That's true, all no-drop would fix this. However, the real fix to this is that players get along. If there's a warrior in the group that needs an item, let him have it. That's how I play. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: c) IMPROVE TRADE SKILLS. Well, more work needs to be done to make the products of many tradeskills financially viable. This would however improve its chances. More people may buy the racially smithed armor if they can't walk to the nearest bazaar and buy a full suit of rygorr, or worse the mid-level quest armor that was made for questing (that one really blew my mind, buying quest armor: Bah!). ]</i></font><br><br>At the same time, you'd destroy the ability of most tradespeople to even make stuff. They could no longer purchase simple items like ruined pelts. Even with the anti-bottom feeding code they will have trouble getting any magical components. Those are going to get expensive, but then so will the items made from those components&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: c) SOLVE TWINK ISSUE. If you believe that twinking is wrong this would solve that. ]</i></font><br><br>Not really. People would twink just like they would bottom feed; have the twink in the area to loot the item. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: d) AVOID PUNISHING PLAYERS FOR LEVELLING. It allows anyone to finish any quest, regardless of level, and thus not punishing players for simply not having discovered a certain quest until too late! ]</i></font><br><br>True, and this is the major drawback of the anti-bottom feeding code. I don't, however, think that this one selling point makes the idea of turning all items no-drop better than the anti-bottom feeding code. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: e) ENCOURAGES LONG TERM PLAYING. NO-DROP is why everyone wants to level and get into Temple of Veeshan or Sleepers Tomb someday... they see the stuff that comes out of there but can't have any unless they earn it themselves because much of it is not tradable.]</i></font><br> <br>But then, if you've fought your way into the Temple of Veeshan, maybe you deserve the right to give away the stuff you found there. And, well, if seeing the Temple of Veeshan in person isn't enough of a reason to go there, then maybe a roleplaying server isn't the right place for that person to play. Going to a place like that shouldn't be about the loot. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: f) REDUCE PLAYER SCAMS. How many of your Customer Service (CS) responses are due to trade scams? How many are due to people claiming someone logged on their account and traded everything away before de-levelling them 5 times? How much CS time would be saved with the no-drop plan? ]</i></font><br><br>No drop items don't change that. Those people would just destroy the items in question. We're talking about disgruntled spouses, guildmates, roommates, friends&#8230; <br><br>And people that try to scam the GMs by giving items away and then claiming they were scammed&#8230; they don't play EverQuest anymore. While it's a noble idea to try to reduce the workload on the customer service staff, that's not really an issue. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I can't begin to tell you how viable this is, providing you find the right balance of what you determine should be tradable. The game, IMO as it stands now, is often less about playing as it is about the "phat lewt". It's sad, so much of the game is missed with that mindset. Yet the no-drop items would make each player actually earn and feel proud about the armor and items he or she wields and thus return some of the original glory and amazement back to the game. <br><br>Everquest is about adventuring. Not sitting in East Commons or Greater Faydark for days on end trying to buy low and sell high. Atleast this is my vision of the game, and I suspect close to yours too. ]</i></font><br><br>Sure, it is viable. I just don't think it's superior to the other plan, which I'm still not sure I like. Making things no-drop certainly wouldn't change anyone's focus away from the Phat Lewt, if that is their focus. And for some people, playing EverQuest is about sitting in East Commons buying low and selling high. No, that's not what I do when I play. But for some that's the fun part. The no-drop thing really critically impacts trade skills in such a way that I just can't see it working. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I love the ideas so far - but a couple of others that make the "no no-drop" more workable imho: <br><br>a) Must be grouped to trade - this prevents evis from trading with goods - but neutrals could still act as go betweens.<br>b) Trading allowed only in city zones - goes along with the auction channel theme and means evils and goods can trade, but only if they have similar faction somewhere so they dont "hate" each other.<br>c) Trading of lore and formerly no drop items allowed only in city zones (can still trade food or summoned items in the field). <br><br>Love the rule set generally - would make a great server. <br><br>Gypsum ]</i></font><br><br>I don't really like a). But it's an interesting idea. <br><br>b) is pretty darn restrictive&#8230; but it's also an interesting idea. <br><br>c) borders on brilliant, and might be something that can actually be done in code (not that I know, I'm not a programmer&#8230;) <br><br>Thanks for the ideas, I'll pass them on. <br><br>Beldukil wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Wouldnt there be a problem with neutrals having too much flexibility. There should definitely be an advantage to being good or evil just as neutrality has its advantages. <br><br>Also some classes are almost necessary for the high end game, like rogues. Are rogues necesarily evil? ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, it might be important to add some incentive to being extremely good or evil. That's certainly on our list of things to look at. <br><br>And rogues might very well range from good to evil, I don't know. But I don't see why they would have to be evil. Robin Hood wasn't evil&#8230; :)  We haven't worked out the alignment chart yet, so I can't answer that for sure. <br><br>Sengan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well a couple of things seem to be off with the rules suggestions. <br><br>First, if neutrals can be buffed and healed by anyone, why would someone play a non-neutral? Sure, many will, but the neutrals are likely to way outbalance the non-neutrals, particularly if they include the main classes (cleric,caster of some form, warrior of some form). <br><br>Languages,/ooc,/auction/shout - sounds like a move to make this a server of isolation rather than commmunity. I can easily see groups of trolls, who could care less about interacting with humans, etc. In a PvE environment, no reason for them to interact. They form a troll guild, travel in troll groups, take care of their factions with the npcs so they can travel pretty much anywhere, take down dragons and other high level things with trolls only, etc. There is little incentive to work with the human,dwarf etc players. They can go anywhere (once they establish some faction with the local merchants or guards) and have no need to interact with people from the other races. Rather than making a community, the proposed rules sound like they are designed to make many smaller communities on the server with none of them having any great need to interact with the other communities. In a PvP world like Sullon, the trolls could be attacked by the human players, in a PvE world though, the players are irrelevant and the npc's are what matter. Some of the things one does in the game would be easier if you took the time to learn the other peoples languages, but not easier enough to necessarily make it worth while doing. Likewise trading - you can sell to another troll as easily as you can sell to a human, so if you dont want to take time learning human speech, just sell to your own isolated community. <br><br>Maybe it is just me, but the strengths of the game have always been the community, the commmunications, the interaction. Too many of these rules seem designed as being the opposite of all of those. If the proposed rules indicated that npc's were going to be downgraded, it sounds like the kind of rules you would make for a solo player server more than a role-play server. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, it also seems more natural to me that the majority of the world be neutral. But we're hoping that enough people will play on the extremes to keep things fun. I suspect that a lot of the people that choose to play on this server will choose to be something extreme, like a paladin or a cleric to Innoruuk. But, as I mentioned, we'll certainly keep our eyes open for the need for incentives to play evil and good. <br><br>And we're not taking about creating solo play here, what we're doing is reducing the size of the community for the lower level characters. Trolls will hang out with trolls. Ogres will hang out with ogres. That seems more natural than having Trolls work their faction up with some group so that they can more easily group with humans&#8230; We want a more insular feeling, more of a dedication to your race than you might see on other servers. If a lot of dwarf only, elf only, troll only guilds form on this server, that's great. <br><br>We're not eliminating the community at all, we're just cutting it up into smaller pieces. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: How would the language change affect those classes (rogue, bard, enchanter) that are capable of taking on the guise of another race? Part of the aspect of roleplay for these classes would be to master illusions in certain situations, yet their language would impair them from being able to completely pull it off. <br><br>-Jade ]</i></font><br><br>Great, isn't it! <br><br>Yes, if you want to pretend to be a dark elf, you might want to learn the language&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm happy to hear that this idea is moving forward. But in terms of practicality, given that everyone will be anonymous and shout being reduced in range, won't it be difficult to find groups in the larger zones? <br><br>--<br>Orfeo Calliopen<br>30 Bard<br>Ayonae Ro ]</i></font><br><br>It sure will. Maybe, just maybe, on this server people will be meeting in town to gather their groups to go adventuring. Leveling will probably be slower on this server, and that's fine too. Remember, when roleplaying it is the journey that is the adventure, not how fast you make it. <br><br>To answer a couple of questions that I've seen but didn't want to paste the whole comment here: Yes, there will be agnostics on this server. No, we don't know when this will go live. I wouldn't expect it soon. Just like Sullon, this server will take a lot of special coding and testing. While we're enthusiastic about this idea, we have a lot of stuff to work on right now that will probably take priority over such a server.<br> <br>Thanks for the 427 comments you've sent in so far. It's sure kept me busy reading&#8230; :)</UL>

Alan VanCouvering <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000241.html">added this announcement</a> to the Developer's Corner regarding the Sullon Zek server:<UL>Here is a note from Hobart about some stuff we still plan to do with Sullon.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I wanted to give some information on what we are still planning to do with Sullon.<br><br>The first thing that will always be in progress is adding Sullon specific content. You will notice that their a some new NPC's that will start to appear on this server to guide and explain the rules and what options you may have as a member of a certain Deity Alliance.<br><br>For Example: The first set of NPC's will offer an item for a small donation that will allow players to identify players of another alliance through armor tints. This NPC will also explain in more detail how Insignias work, and what they may be used for in the future. NOTE: Not all these NPC's are done for every deity. They will be completed and patched as time permits.<br><br>The second topic is team balance.<br><br>Very soon, there will be methods to determine outside the game what team has control of what areas. The strength and maybe some other stats about that team will be shown. We may increase or decrease the reward for a particular alliance based on this information. An example would be offering a larger bounty for the insignia of a slain Cazic Thule follower over the insignia of a slain Tunare follower.<br><br>On this same topic will be slightly changing the way teams identify each other through /con. We will be changing it such that each team will be able to tell which team his target is aligned with. This will help those who wish to form a temporary alliance with another team.<br><br>Other gameplay issues.<br><br>We will be removing the below level 6 PvP immunity in mid to high level adventure zones. This will be done to prevent players below level 6 from causing grief without the higher level players having a means to retaliate. A prime example of this is the level 5 bard training sand giants in the oasis. Because this would be considered a mid level adventure zone, the level 5 bard could and would most likely be killed by another player. This will indeed make the trek from one city to another, which is currently pretty safe for players below level 6, much more difficult if it involves going through adventure zones.<br><br>Example zones where the below 6 PvP immunity would remain would be: Nektulos, Qeynos Hills, Innothule, and East Commons. These are just some of the examples. We will provide a full list or provide an in-game method of notifying the player when he enters one of the zones where this is implemented.<br><br>We will be removing the ability for bards to use songs on boats. Following shortly behind that will come the removal of any melee combat on the boats. Before doing this, we will be taking a look at ways of insuring the safety of a traveler on a boat from NPC's in the ocean.<br><br>We will be also changing the way PvP experience loss works on Sullon. The current problem is that a high level player can repeatedly kill lower level players without risk. The higher level player can continue to harass these lower level players without risk of experience or coin loss for any amount of time. While one could use the same argument that the lower level players are also losing nothing, we feel there should be some innate risk with a higher level player bottom feeding these lower level players. With this change, it will make higher level players think twice before attacking low level players. This will also give groups of lower level players an incentive to group up and take on higher level adversaries. So we intend to change the rules so that any character killed by a lower level character will lose experience.

New message is up on the Patch Server:<UL>July 10th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br><br>** Bug Fixes **<br><br>- The "NPC unerringly sticks on pet" AI bug implemented in the last patch has been fixed.  This resolves a bug that occurred a short while ago that would cause pets to be the focus for most attacks by NPCs.<br><br>- Fixed the animation problem where an animation played on the upper body would get stuck.  This could be seen by starting to cast a spell and then walking forward while it was playing the casting animation.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow a player to target an invisible PC or NPC with the F7 or F8 keys even if they had See Invisible up.<br><br>- Stacking issues with 'change form' type spells have been corrected.  Lich and Clarity will no longer stack, nor will Spirit of Wolf and Wolf Form.<br><br>- The bug with screenshots that some people experienced when using 32-bit color mode should be fixed.<br><br><br>** Item and Vendor Adjustments **<br><br>- Changed the forged Antonian Javelins to be stackable.<br><br>- Gnome Skin Sleeves are now droppable and rentable.<br><br>- Spiderling and Spider Silks are now stackable<br><br>- Spider Legs are now stackable.<br><br>- Tarnished weapons worth slightly more to the vendors than the rusty ones.<br><br>- Reduced the weight of the monk only Black Pantherskin armor.<br><br>- All Sheets of metal and Folded Sheets of metal are now stackable.<br><br>- Rangers will now be able to wear Girdle of Reflection<br><br>- There is now a vendor in Felwithe that sells the Enchant Ores series of enchanter spells.<br><br><br>** Zone and Quest Changes **<br><br>-  The Crazed Ghouls should be less of a problem in Unrest.<br><br>- The Monk red headband quest should now be available again.<br><br>- We've added a few more Yew Leaf spawns.<br><br>- Reevaluated the values of the various fish fillets.  All fish vendors should return to normal, but they won't be paying as well for certain fishy items.  This resolves a problem that was created with the increased value of player made food items all over Norrath.  Some of food items were made too valuable, and merchants were complaining to their union leaders...<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br><br>** Gen Con Event **<br><br>Sony Online Entertainment cordially invites you to participate in a special online tournament of gladiatorial combat to be held at GenCon in August.<br><br>When: August 2-5, 2001 (pre-registration for GenCon ends July 9, 2001) <br>Where: Milwaukee Wisconsin at the Midwest Express Center <br><br>Join us and the 26,000 other people that will be attending the nation's largest gaming convention.

As traditional for any of his articles, Shadoe has finished the <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid994800308,21053,">Reader Response Edition</a> for his latest editorial.  You may recall the topic of that particular editorial focused on SOE's announcement of a Character Transfer Service.  Here's a clip:<UL>If there's one thing I want to stress to the readers, it's that "sticking it to the players" was not the core issue of this article. If I had to narrow it down to one statement (and it so turns out that I do), it's about the act of compromising principle, and money plays a huge part of it. For those of you who loathe Verant for their "corporate fat cat" attitude, let me point out that if I ever once had the opportunity to make the kind of money that's at stake here, I wouldn't so much as blink before I took advantage of it to its fullest. Most of you would do the same. To reiterate: It's how capitalism works, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. <br><br>But I would also call a spade a spade, and face up to what it is I'm doing. I also like to believe that if there were moral grounds not to take advantage of such an opportunity, that I'd at least seriously consider passing it by. A reason like, say, the good of the game I was hosting, and the players who rely on me to uphold those moral reasons. <br><br>In his post, our own Mr. McQuaid makes the claim that Verant has, in fact, not abandoned their past reasons for refusing character transfers. True to proper form, he has bulleted the specifics behind his claim, and here are my thoughts on each of them... </UL>Thanks Shadoe!

While updates on the Developer's Corner were dominated by Brad and Gordon's news, Alan kept busy doing follow-up work on several key topics:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html"><b>Roleplaying Server</b></a><br>ThePavlovianHippie wrote: <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: disabling the no-drop flag on the RP server. <br>Lore items would still exist, but ANY item would <br>be tradable.<br><br>Let us know what you think. <br>Here are some questions to consider ... (by the way, all these items are currently no drop) :)<br><br>Ring from the Ancient Cyclops - drop or no drop? <br><br>Uber Sword 123 - drop or no drop? <br><br>Warrior epic weapon - drop or no drop? <br><br>Rogue Burning Rapier - drop or no drop? <br><br>Canine (used for a quest in Fironia Vie. Turn in 4, get faction and experience) - drop or no drop? <br><br>The Raster of Guk Idol - drop or no drop? <br><br>My own personal thoughts are as follows ... <br><br>Ring of the Ancients - drop. If somebody wants to camp the Ancient Cyclops and then sell the ring, more power to 'em. =0) <br><br>Uber sword 123 - drop. Any weapon or piece of armor that comes from a baddie should be droppable. <br><br>Warrior epic - no drop. This goes without saying. =0) ]</i></font><br><br>Rogue Burning Rapier - a fairly nice mid level Rogue weapon. I'm sorta split on this. On the one hand, it's not an overwhelming weapon by any means, so if someone quested for it, then decided to trade it at some point, more power to 'em. Right? However, it is a really great quest, and for a Rogue to be able to buy it without going through the Redemption quest is sort of a cop out. In this case, for a weapon gotten from a quest, I'd have to say No Drop. <br><br>The Canine, and other items like the gnoll tooth in Qeynos, or the Sarnak War Braid in the Overthere. I'd say No Drop, because it basically allows someone to get free faction very quickly. Somebody could get 60 canine's, then sell it to someone who wants to bypass the time it took to get those items, and get fantastic faction in Fironia Vie in a few minutes. Rather defeats the purpose of the complex faction system you have set up. <br><br>And finally, the Idol from Raster. I've already said that the Burning Rapier should be no drop, and the reward from the idol is very similar to that quest. However, in this case, I think that the idol should be dropable. The result (Robe of the Lost Circle), as in the Burning Rapier quest, should be No Drop. <br><br>I'm sure there's a lot of other situations you've come up with for items that can be no drop, but they probably all fall in to these categories ... a no drop item off a baddie. Those should be droppable. A no drop item that is a quest reward ... should remain no drop. A no drop item that is PART of a quest ... should be droppable. And a no drop item that you turn in to gain faction. I think these should remain no drop. <br><br>And there you have it. And thanks for all these great tweaks your making to keep Everquest fresh and interesting! =0)[/b] <br><br>Let me try to tackle this. I'm not personally convinced about this whole bottom-feeding/drop thing yet either. But I think I can answer your questions. <br><br>Any item that is cool enough to want to trade for great reward (even an epic item) would be too cool to actually trade. It find it highly unlikely that someone would want to work their behinds off to get an epic and then trade or sell it. After all, what sort of value would you place on it? <br><br>But it also makes sense to keep the epics as no-drop. And there may very well be items that remain no-drop, even if you implement the anti-bottom feeding idea across the world, such as planar loot that requires a certain level to even get onto the plane. <br><br>But things like quest teeth, why not let people sell them? If they want to take the effort to gather them up and then give someone else the 'credit' for killing them for the notoriety (faction), then why not? The argument in most cases like this can easily go both ways. <br><br>The ring off the cyclops&#8230; well, the same thing applies. The nice thing here is that with the anti-bottom feeding code, only people that are going to find that NPC a challenge will be able to get the ring in the first place. So you won't see a super high level character camping the ring, if he kills the cyclops, that cyclops just doesn't own the ring in question. <br><br>As I said, I'm not sold on the idea myself yet. But I can see the merits of it. <br><br>Nistrum wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Woot, I agree on all counts. Couple of questions, the planes... What about the Velious Planar Armor Quests such as Skyshrine, Kael, etc. and Particle Weapons (Epic Weapons), would they no longer be NO DROP? Also the Jboots quest would become ultra easy, *wonders on the price of the formerly NO DROP quest items*. Will you only remove the NO DROP from the end result, but leave all the components of the quest NO DROP to prevent UBER twinking? The Solusek quests would become easier and more accessible as well if your friends could cover a camp for you, etc. I agree with the blue server idea, I am tired of all the cool ideas going to the PK servers. I personally never wanted DEs in my groups in my blue server while playing as my HIE CLR, vice versa while playing my DEF WIZ, now what use would they be if they cant receive or give beneficial spells. ]</i></font><br><br>Keep in mind, we're talking about one character on this server. Twinking can obviously still happen, but it won't be real common. It's a real good friend that will take his high level character to the planes to get armor for someone else's low level character. And, well, from a roleplaying perspective, there's no reason that a high level paladin wouldn't give some ancient and powerful armor to another paladin, or that a guild wouldn't aid their guild members with items that they don't actually need. 'Twinking' isn't an anti-roleplaying concept any more than a 'good' troll is. It's certainly the kind of thing that should be rare, but it's not inherently against the concept of roleplaying. <br><br>NoMAD-PO wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I like everything you have presented as a possibilyt for a RP server save one <br><br>PvP (or lack of) <br><br>The main reason I feel PvP should be standard is it allows players to sette disputes on their own..I mean in a RP world, if some disgusting hafling were to throw his drink on me, I would be compelled to do something about it (and it doesnt really fit a RP world to have to wait for him to consent to a duel before i taught him some manners) <br><br>The ability of the players to fight one another is just as important a part of role-play as anything else you mentioned in your announcement..yes, you can duel, and have guild wars but that alll requires CONSENT of everyone and that clearly (tomme anyway) falls outside of most defintions of role playing. <br><br>Maybe one idea on a RP server would be to raise the level limt of where PvP combat may start (maybe raise it to lvl 10 and employ PvP ala Sullon Zek but use the Rallos Zek conning rules (5 lvl range for pvp targets) and keep loot coin only ]</i></font><br><br>I agree with you, in principle. Roleplaying requires that the player characters be able to interact with each other as completely as they wish to. And that's how it works in our D&D games. <br><br>But the reality in massively multiplayer games is completely different. So far the ability to PvP seems to counteract the desire to roleplay in many people. If I could hand-pick the players on a roleplaying server, then I'd also feel confident in it being a PvP server because I would feel secure in the knowledge that if the character attacked me, he or she would have a reason for it. <br><br>But with massively multiplayer gaming being what it is, this isn't the case. It might be true that every person on the server that attacks another character is doing so with all the 'right' roleplaying reasons. But even if that were true, nobody would believe it. There just isn't the confidence in PvP for roleplayers. And, despite my belief that roleplaying in the perfect world would require PvP&#8230; well, this isn't the perfect world. And right now people are interested in a non-PvP roleplaying server. <br><br>I've played a lot on Sullon lately. There is a sense of tension there, a certain paranoia, that is required to play PvP. A lot of roleplayers aren't comfortable in that atmosphere either. <br><br>So this one is going to be a non-PvP server. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Wow. There are so many questions I have on this but with today's update I have this one: <br><br>So I'm a 20th level enchanter who is totally out of bat wings and needs to go get some quickly so I can use it as my reagent for my levitate spell. <br><br>So I can't go kill bats in Greater Faydark anymore to collect my spell components? <br><br>The prices on things like bat wings and bone chips will go through the roof (low levels already make a killing on these items.) <br><br>Other things I wonder about are things like items needed for trade skills. What about finding eggs for baking? What about finding spider silks for tailoring? How will things like that be handled with this loot code. <br><br>OK so I have some comments too: <br><br>While we can agree to disagree on the PvP being needed for an RP server is there ANY possibility of finding a way to do multi duels or at least group dueling? Something to refine the blue server duel system would be a great improvement without resorting to all out PvP. <br><br>I'm concerned about this being a one character server. As a roleplayer I enjoy creating characters with rich histories. I'd hate to see myself limited to one character on a server that will be all a buzz with RP. <br><br>I love the language thing. I understand the /emote issue. I'm glad to know that you're discussing adding more canned emotes to add to things. <br><br>CarielKalyn, Fennin Ro ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, you gave me a moment of panic. So I rushed out to have Abashi hit me on the side of the head. <br><br>Bat wings will drop for everyone, even in the Warrens. Only special items won't drop off NPCs that are too low level. So no worry there. <br><br>I'll mention the idea of new dueling rules and such to the team. But, well, it's not going to be critical to the implementation of a roleplaying server. Nice, sure. Critical, no. <br><br>And I said the exact same thing, I like to play all sorts of characters, how can I choose one! Well, it's one of the prices we pay, that's all. :)<br><br>Lodious wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I love the ideas so far. The only one I'm not fond of is the artificial barrier placed on grouping between goods and evils. This is enforced RPing. I prefer you just set up the right environment for RPing and leave it at that (e.g. turning Common into Human for speaking) <br><br>Have you considered trying a lighter version of all this: <br><br>1. one character limit<br>2. Warren's looting rules<br>3. NO DROP tag removed<br>4. Common Speak changed to Human Speak <br><br>and that's it! ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, it is enforced roleplaying. And, well, that's ok. <br><br>There are already 40 or so EverQuest servers with unenforced roleplaying in place, and people complain to me all the time that they can't or won't or don't roleplay on those servers. And those servers <b>are</b> the right environment for roleplaying&#8230; <br><br>Limiting the number of characters is enforcing roleplaying (if you assume that twinking is inherently opposite roleplaying). The removal of Common Tongue is enforcing roleplaying. My dark elf never, ever, speaks Common, and nobody forces me to play him that way. <br><br>Yes, the idea of enforcing roleplaying is a bit harsh, and in general I don't like it. <br><br>But, well, it seems that a lot of people want us to enforce it, even you. So we're going to give it a try. The grouping barrier between good and evil characters isn't really any different than a barrier between their languages. It indicates how we think those of evil alignment and those of good alignment should interact, and we're set to enforce that on this server. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think the idea that Good and Evil characters can't group on an RP server is a bit short sighted. Who's to say one evil RP guild won't want to group with a good guild to crush an opposing evil enemy. Another situation could be where good enlists an evil guild for a task (good and evil are very subjective). If this was a pvp server then yes I'd agree because "immortal" healing does take away from the fun of such an environment. On this type of server though, it seems like this rule would be limiting. Let the players create the environment and come to agreements on these types of rules. <br><br>Dzenari Darktear<br>51st Wizard of Innoruuk,<br>Tallon Zek <br><br>P.S. Please address weather or not the new transfer service will apply to such a server. ]</i></font><br><br>Your good and evil guilds will still be able to work together to fight the common evil.

There has been a lot of big EQ news over the last few days, and I'm here to tell you that it looks like it won't become quiet anytime soon.  Brad McQuaid laid the groundwork for an RP server in a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html">recent Developers Corner update</a>.  Don't believe us?  Check this out:<UL>Hi all, <br>Well, you've probably heard that we're seriously considering an 'RP' server. In the past we've shy&#8217;d away from launching one for the following reasons:<br><br>1. It's very difficult to get a large group of people to agree on what 'role playing' really means, much less 'role playing rules' that would be applied to an EverQuest server.<br><br>2. Whatever ruleset we decided upon, who knows if people would like it and play there? It's risky to launch such an experimental server.<br><br>3. EverQuest IS an Role Playing Game anyway, so in that sense, ALL servers are RP servers.<br><br>Well, some things have changed. Let me address the three previous issues we've had with an RP server:<br><br>1. This certainly remains true, but, well, to be brutally honest: too bad  We're going to choose some rules, listen to feedback, perhaps make some changes, and launch an RP server. Some players will object, and argue, and debate, and, well, we're going forward anyway. It's either a. we subjectively come up with some rules that some or many might disagree with or b. we don't do an RP server at all. I prefer &#8216;a&#8217; <br><br>2. You may have noticed Sullon Zek. It has some pretty experimental, wild and crazy rules and ideas as well. This is what's pretty cool: EQ is so big now (400,000+ active subscribers) with so many servers that we can launch some experimental ones. Back in the day when we had 7 or 10 or 15... well, it wouldn't have been prudent. But now, we're going for it <br><br>3. This remains true, and to be honest with you, I don't know if I personally like calling this server the 'RP' server. To me it's more like the Siege Perilous server that UO had. Maybe it's the 'hard core' server, or the 'extreme' server... *shrug* But anyway, regardless of what it's called, I'm very excited about the ideas and rules behind it.<br><br>Which brings us to this: I'm going to post our initial thoughts on what the rules will be. Now here's where the BIG disclaimer comes in: we are posting these for feedback and ideas from you, but they are NOT SET IN STONE. They are VERY subject to change. Heck, expect them to change.<br><br>Disclaimer #2: I do NOT have a date as to when we'll launch this server. It may be the next server we launch, or the one after that. We're not sure yet. Please don't bombard us with 'when' questions, because we won't be able to answer them.<br><br>Anyways, here are our fairly solid but not final ideas:<br><br>1) Each race/class combination will be assigned an alignment, either Good, Neutral or Evil. A high elven paladin of Tunare will be good (as will a dwarven paladin of Brell, probably), a dark elven warrior of Innoruuk will be evil. This will be a subjective list, so let's not debate yet whether a dark elven rogue of Bristlebane will be neutral or evil. The idea is that eventually each combo will have an alignment. Evils can't group with goods, nor can they heal or buff each other (specific details, such as summoning corpse to be determined). Neutrals will be able to work for either side, and can be healed and buffed by either (Maybe). <br><br>2) Common Tongue becomes Human Tongue. This in combination with #3<br><br>3) Use of languages will be made more difficult. This will include the removal of the Common Tongue. It will include some sort of restriction on the ability to increase language skills (on a per level or per day basis, most likely). The goal is that trolls will have to expend their time and efforts if they want to deal with humans (and vice versa). The removal of Dark Speech might be necessary here.<br><br>4) One character per account.<br><br>5) /ooc will be removed.<br><br>6) /auction will use languages and will be restricted to city zones.<br><br>7) /shout will have a reduced range.<br><br>8) /emote will be changed such that one has to understand the language of the emoter (lest the command simply be used to bypass language barriers).<br><br>9) Guild membership will be restricted so that goods and evils can't be members of the same guild.<br><br>10) /who list will show everyone as 'anonymous'.<br><br>11) 'Warrens' loot code turned on for ALL zones.<br><br>12) This is a PvE server, NOT a PvP server.<br><br>Let us know what you think (via the normal feedback, not Ask Brad).<br><br>thanks,<br><br>-Brad</UL>

Gordon Wrinn <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000239.html">shared some thoughts</a> on the configuration of the Sullon Zek teams on the Developer's Corner.  Here's the post:<UL>Most Sullon players, I think, noticed the MOTD on Sullon last week hinting that the Nameless was thinking of levying large penalties against those in the Evil Alliance due to the outnumbering of others. Frankly, we're wondering if anything *really* needs to be done. <br><br>Evils currently outnumber good and neutral combined and have a higher average level due to there being safety in numbers and the geographical isolation of the Iksar. <br><br>So why did so many people join Evil? It's not one of power -- The class availability of the teams is in good balance. I imagine zone-control is a big part, but my guess is that it comes down mostly to "evil" seeming "cooler" than good. Do players *really* find this a problem? How many players joined Good expressly for the higher difficulty level and the "target rich environment"? How many joined evil due to a desire to be a part of what's imagined to be the "winning team"?<br><br>Right now based on the point-system announced last week, evil and good are scoring a similar number of points despite there being 4x as many evils as good. Neutral on the other hand is laying waste to both other teams despite being outnumbered by evil?<br><br>I suppose what it comes down to more than anything is: Are people having fun? <br><br>We have been discussing potential "solutions" to the team lop-sidedness. Some have suggested that we tweak experience rewards so that Good and Neutral level faster in order to make those teams more attractive. Others have suggested that we make evil level slower. Differing experience penalties on death have also been discussed. Frankly I'm not a fan of either of these ideas for one main reason: Everyone caps out at level 60, and come level 60 differing experience requirements don't mean squat.<br><br>There is another idea that we've been discussing. It's passed internal muster, which means it's time to bring it up and see what Sullon players think. As it's hard for us to query players of individual servers or rulesets on their thought, I'll ask everyone replying to open their reply with whether or not they play on Sullon currently.<br><br>Our idea is this, in the words of EQLive's Assistant Producer Bill "Solist" Coyle, what's the one thing throughout fantasy literature that has made it possible for Good to stand their ground and beat back the overwhelming forces of Evil? <br><br><br>/em plays some suspenseful music...<br><br><br>.<br><br><br>.<br><br><br>.<br><br><br>.<br><br><br>Wait for it....<br><br>.<br><br><br>.<br><br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>Why, it's the fact that Evil eventually turns on itself. <br><br><b>Duh duh duh duuuuuum!</b><br><br>Our idea is, simply, allow Team Evil to attack each other... <br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Associate Producer<br>EverQuest Live / Luclin<br>Sony Online Entertainment</UL>

Vice President Brad McQuaid <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000237.html">announced the creation</a> of the second "Ask Brad" column on the Developer's Corner.  The following is the complete announcement:<UL>Hello all,<br><br>Some of you who read voodooextreme.com might have noticed the &#8216;Ask Brad&#8217; column that was recently added. Well, I was thinking, if there&#8217;s an interest, of doing something similar here as well.<br><br>How it works is this: people send in emails, asking me questions. I sift through them, pick out a few every week or so, and then answer them. I was thinking of doing both columns, in that different people read that site as well as this one (although I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s overlap).<br><br>I am more interested in answering certain questions than others, though. In other words, I have neither the time nor the inclination to compete with Absor  I&#8217;m not looking for EverQuest current event questions, or why a certain item was changed or has certain stats, or whether a quest works or not, or why was &#8216;taunt&#8217; changed recently, or to engage in a big debate over the precise rule set of Sullon Zek vs. Tallon Zek.<br><br>That&#8217;s what this board in general is for, and we already have a working feedback loop in place.<br><br>Rather, I&#8217;d be interested in answering more broad questions. Questions about game design in general, or why certain decisions were made in creating EverQuest. Or even questions about some of our other announced products, and how they might be similar or different to EverQuest. Or questions about our company in general, our philosophies, what we do every day, how games are developed... or even, 'Brad, who the heck are you anyway?'<br><br>Now, I&#8217;m not at all certain how many people are interested in this sort of thing, but heck, let&#8217;s give it a try. Send your emails directly to me, but make sure they have ASK BRAD in the beginning of the subject, or they&#8217;ll slip through my email filter. Then every week or so I&#8217;ll reply to as many as I can with a public post in this forum (btw, when you send an email in, if you don&#8217;t want your name shown, please make sure you let me know).<br><br>And please try to adhere to the themes and topics I&#8217;ve described. I&#8217;ll have to ignore everything else (and, of course, that includes flames and the like &#8211; please be nice to me :) ). <br><br>My email: <a href="mailto:bmcquaid@station.sony.com">bmcquaid@station.sony.com</a><br><br>-Brad McQuaid<br>Executive Producer, EverQuest<br>Vice President, Premium Games<br>Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive</UL>

Brad McQuaid again visited the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=13581076&replies=33">thread dedicated to Shadoe's latest article</a>.  This time around Brad responded to a post made by a player named Malakie.  Here's the scoop: <UL>I think I can honestly say, Brad, that noone is buying what your selling here. Even with your reasons, as sound as you might percieve them, I doubt very many people you are doing it simply out of the goodness of your hearts. The fact that Verant is actually stating that giving players this option will STRENGTHEN the community is laughable. <br><br>I also agree with a previous poster about the policy on not moving no drop items. While I think it's fine and dandy that you say "We are not allowing any items/coin to be moved, including no drop items," your logic in dissallowing it is, quite frankly, shoddy(sp.) I think you'd have just said "We are not moving any items" and left it at that. <br><br>I did read all of the rules and such, and I' quite glad no moves are allowed to/from Test and Sullon Zek. Very good move there. <br><br>Malakie <br>50 Enchanter <br>Test Server <br><br>BTW, Brad... Test Server just passed it's 1 year anniversy of the item whipe. Just thought I'd throw in a friendly reminder. <br><br><b><I>malakie: I'm sorry you feel that way. The reason we say we are doing it to strengthen community is because we want to bring friends or family that might have started on different servers together. <br><br>What we don't want are extreme power gamers hopping from one server to another, collecting phat lewts, ever in search of servers where one can 'buy low', and then transfering to another to 'sell high'. <br><br>Also, players know how many high-end items are in the game, including no-drop items. We don't want to disrupt that aspect of community either. Some players take pride in knowing they were one of the first on their server to obtain an item, and I think it might be a bummer to suddenly have someone else with that item transfer in. So that's why we're not allowing no-drop items to move either. <br><br>But there are times when friends or family are found on different servers, and they want to be together. They are willing to make a sacrifice to be together, and this is what our character transfer program is for. <br><br>I assure you that were we doing this just to make a buck, we'd lower the price and allow people to move with items -- the result would be a LOT more people interested, and therefore a LOT more revenue. <br><br>But, and probably contrary to what some might believe, I don't believe in hurting the health of the game long term to make a buck short term. <br><br>-Brad </b></I></UL>

In this post, Brad McQuaid attempts to explain Verant/SOE's decision to allow transfers, for a price, after years of saying it wasn't an option:<UL>There have been three major reasons we've not accomodated server moves before: <br><br>1. We were concerned that it would upset the economies on the destination server <br><br>2. We lacked the manpower to accomdate the moves. <br><br>3. We were afraid one server might be perceived as 'better' or more 'popular' and that players would flock there. <br><br>We've now addressed these three issues: <br><br>1. You move without items, and the cost is somewhat prohibitive. In other words, players will hopefully move for the right reasons now, and being sans items shouldn't measurably disturb the destination server's economy. <br><br>2. We've updated our billing system and automated much of the task, such that the manpower hit is minimal. <br><br>3.

Yea, they look like chickens, I would assume they taste like chicken (doesn't everything? :-) and they make a annoying chicken-like noise so we call them chickens. Same with Dreadlands. Filtering out fowl language would require everyone to say "cockatrice" which is a lot harder to type in the middle of a battle! <br><br>So leave the whole fowl language thing alone.

We don't want to kick people out of our game, those people are paying us to let them play our game. But profanity and harassment cause other people to quit the game. It makes for an unpleasant gaming environment, and that's not what we want. So even if you think we're too harsh with our rules, please follow them.

I can understand the no items/coin well enough but there are some details left out on that page. <br><br>What about faction? I know people work hard for thier Velious factions and the like and it would be a large factor in any decision that I make to use this or not. <br><br>No Drop Items? I know these probably fall under said policy but these type of items would not have a bering on the economy and alot of these items are hard to come by. I dont really see a problem with these being transfered. <br><br>Names. When I transferred over I got my name as soon as I could on my old server to keep it. But it was a warrior and I wanted to change him to some other class. In that process I was not able to recover my name so I can only assume that someone else got it in that short period of time. Now when I come over I was wondering what the policy on name changes while using this service. If I come over as NAMEx can I just change my first name to something else? That would also factor in my decision process. <br><br>Well thanks and have a good day. <br><br>Hrothy<br>Aro ]</i></font><br><br>Your faction will travel with your character. <br><br>As for why we won't move items, here's the logic behind it. <br><br>We decided it was in the best interest of the EverQuest community to only move characters without items, coins or the contents of their bank. If we permitted characters to move with their items, coins and the contents of their bank, it would affect the economy and item balance on their new server. Server economies vary and a move to a different server by a high level character or a large guild could completely change the economy on that server and could also drastically affect the gameplay and game balance. <br><br>No drop items are a part of that economy. Just the appearance of a new high level character on a server can have a dramatic effect on the social and economic properties of that server. Allowing no-drop items to suddenly appear on a server where perhaps only a few, or none, have been gathered yet impacts those that were on that server already. No, that person couldn't sell these items for some unreasonably high price on the new server, since they are no drop. But those items affect the culture on a server. And many no-drop items are stepping stones for large quest rewards. It would be possible to transfer with quest items that would make gaining certain items, such as epic items, much easier to get on the new server if that server wasn't mature enough for the characters to tackle certain obstacles that were more easily tackled on another server. <br><br>We also have to consider the reasons that people move. Folks moving to join friends on a different server will have people there to help them recover their items. People moving to escape a bad reputation won't. <br><br>We understand that this service will not appeal to all of our customers. But it will appeal to many, and this is the form for that service that has the least negative impact on those that don't use it, which is the majority of our customers. <br><br>As for the name thing, you can petition and a GM will change your name if you have an appended 'x'. <br><br>Xelene wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Never mind, the link works when I click on it from the front page.

Bolding going where no man has never gone before, Shadoe has written  a brand new editorial tackling, you guessed it, the new character transfer service.  In my opinion it's one of his best yet, so be sure to read it.  An excerpt from <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid994454754,62624,">Beam Me Up, Verant!</a> can be read here:<UL>Now, before you grab your favorite e-mail suite and write up a nastygram accusing me of being against moving characters across servers, let me just say you're wasting your time. I, for one, see tremendous value in being able to do this. I, for one, am even tempted to use this service for more than one of my characters. I think that transferring characters between servers can, in fact, be a Good Thing. I've often wished that Verant would reconsider their stance on this issue, and I'm glad to see this opportunity open up. <br><br>In the same breath, I will also say this is an outright compromise in principle for Verant Interactive. </UL>To respond to the article on our boards, please follow <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=13581076&replies=0"><b>this link</b></a>.<br><br>Thanks Shadoe!

I'm not against evening the playing field, as evil does seem immensely powerful thus far, but I just wanted to point out that any change made is going to offend many people, especially any sort of retroactive change such as changing what team a certain god is on, as one rumor was that Rallos would become neutral. Others just seem outright unfair, such as the evil experience penatly rumor, I'll hold out faith that you all realize that. The other rumored "fix" was that of merging the good and neutral teams. Although this would offend some, I think that if it's really necessary it is the best solution, particularly from a roleplaying perspective. The idea of "newts" that slaughter good and evil sides can, I suppose, be roleplayed somewhat; but it's quite limited and not very realistic. Usually neutral character tend toward good anyway, since they still want to live well, not be slaves, etc. <br><br>On the whole idea of crossteaming, I still do not understand why the teams can't group together (or guild for that matter, but it's less important). It's sort of like saying if you work with someone you hate then you have to quit your job. As long as beneficial spells can't be cast on each other, and they can still hit one another, the team rules can't be exploited. Arbitrarily stopping grouping just stops possible roleplaying situations as I see it, I'm sure such grouping would be a rarity, anyway, but there's just no reason to completely and arbitrarily bar it. ]</i></font><br><br>All of those are rumors. We are talking about things to do, but I haven't heard any of those considered seriously. <br><br>However, if we feel it is necessary, and we find a functional method, then we will make changes to the server rule set. Obviously we don't want to make any major changes unless they are absolutely necessary, and if they are needed, we'll try to make them as painless as we can. But we're certainly willing to make those changes. <br><br>So part of the rumor is true, we are most certainly looking into ideas for shifting the balance a little if it we have to. <br><br>As for cross-teaming, the idea of having teams is to be on your team, not on two teams at once. We most certainly did not 'arbitrarily' prevent grouping across teams. That was done deliberately. We want people to rely on their teammates, we want a segregation between the teams. That was the intent, not an arbitrary decision. <br><br>Mulamasi_TZ wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I like the fact that the teams cant determine which side their on. As an Evil I can just con anyone and see 'Threatening' woohoo! more blood to add to my weapon. <br><br>The fact is if you make it so that goods can con newts and see 'Apprehensive' they can basically form a light alliance where it becomes socially unacceptable to attack newts as a good or goods as a newt. According to the information I've gotten about the server its supposed to be a Deity-War therefore Newts/Goods shouldnt care that they're worshiping 'less evil' deities and should kill them regardless. As a follower of Innoruuk my Troll Shaman is going to be killing anything I can hit :)]</i></font><br><br>But it would also mean that evils and neutrals could more easily make alliances. At the same time, neutrals can't really tell who is who (except for the obvious cases), and will be at as much of a disadvantage as an advantage, and will have to be more careful who they attack than good or evil if they want to keep their alliances solid. <br><br>This didn't go in last patch as we had intended.

I knew what I was getting into when I started this, and being disadvantaged increases the interest of this game by 10X for me. Please, don't nerf the evil, or any, team. They will all evolve according to the players, there is no need of outside interference.

I'll correct the rules. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan, <br><br>Just to make it clear, not everyone who "cross-teams" on VZ/TZ does so for the purpose of immortal healing. In fact, most people who cross-team, do so purely for roleplaying reasons (as I've said before, most of us want to play Light vs. Dark, not a three-way dance like SZ, or a four-way dance like the purists want, or a free-for-all like RZ is). I truly hope you don't think that the only reason people choose to team up across race lines is just so they can cheat. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding your statement where you said: "Cross-teaming is, as far as I know, making guilds and groups that combine teams so that you can use the invulnerable healer properties of the team PvP servers." Quite the contrary, Alan, cross-teaming happens because a lot of us love stories like Lord of the Rings, where Elves, Dwarves, and Humans teamed up to fight the Dark races of their world. We cross team on VZ/TZ because that's the closest thing to giving us what we want to play. We (and I'm speaking for my guild, but I imagine this is true for most Lighty guilds) aren't doing this to cheat. In fact, if a Lighty guild (like mine) only engages with a Darkie guild, then guess what? There can be no immortal healing, because we don't have Darkies, and they don't have Lighties! What a concept, eh? :-) <br><br>I'm not trying to anger you, or sound bitter, I'm just trying to point out that while there may be SOME people who "cross-team" solely to cheat, I don't want you lumping all of us into that catagory. If we had a Light vs. Dark server that we could move our characters to, believe me, we'd move there in a heartbeat and the purists on VZ/TZ could happily play the four-way Race Wars they want, the Sullon Zek players could happily play the three-way Deity Wars they want, and us Light Races vs. Dark Races players could happily play the War of Light against Darkness that we want. No cheating, no immortal healing, no people quitting en masse because you wrecked their guilds/friendships that have been there for two years, etc. We all get to be happy. Even Verant, since they'd be keeping all of us who would quit if we were told we couldn't play Lights vs. Darks anymore. Let's all be happy, eh? <br><br>Respectfully yours, <br><br>Taliaferro Erucolindo<br>Officer of Giliath Lang<br>Vallon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>You're right, it did sound that way. I'm sorry, that wasn't my intent. <br><br>We could argue the proper way to play on the team server until the cows come home (and there ain't no cows comin' home to my little apartment&#8230;) and probably not agree. My counter to your point would be, no, the best place to recreate the Lord of the Rings situation with elves, dwarves and humans teamed up to fight evil would be Rallos Zek, where the battle lines are drawn entirely by the players. On the team servers the lines were set in such a way that it should have been obvious that elves, dwarves and humans were not meant to work together, but to hate each other. <br><br>But I did not mean to imply that everyone that 'cross teams' is doing so in order to exploit the system. I don't believe that to be true. <br><br>On the other hand, if you are grouped with a dwarven paladin, a human cleric, and a elven enchanter, for example, and you are jumped by a band of human thugs&#8230; <br><br>Well, is your human cleric going to refuse to help his friends, or is he going to heal them? <br><br>Regardless of the intent, such situations will arise. And such situations really seem to represent broken gameplay to me. The fact that the human cleric in that situation is forced to choose between doing what he thinks his character would do (heal his friends) and something that his player should see as an abuse of the rules of the server (since the human thugs can't hurt him in any way). <br><br>This isn't a good situation for anyone, really. <br><br>Now that's my feelings on the matter. We also understand that people have grown accustomed to the way it is now, and that some people have formed groups and guilds across the barriers that were so poorly erected against such activity. We know that some people will be upset by this change. But we also know that some will be pleased. <br><br>So we're still discussing it. But the inclination is to makes the rules work, remove the broken invulnerable healer thing, and 'hard code' the teams. That's still the direction we are headed.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000233.html"><b>Patches</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi, i have a few questions on the patch (7/5). <br><br>ok, one, do we need to edit the EQ Client text file in order to see anything new??
