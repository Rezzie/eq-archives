<span class=dateline>February  21, 2000</span> - It was a beautiful day in the Steamfont Mountains.  The air was clean, the sky a perfect deep blue, and the hissing sound of the escaping steam from the vents in the rock gave the area a sense of life.  Rogue clockworks clicked and whirled this way and that, trying to fulfill a faulty programming within them that barely made sense while the Kobolds plan their next strike against the Gnomes.  The wind was just right to power the massive windmills, which aided the Gnomes in their everyday work with the metals they dig up from the mines.  All in all it was a normal day in Steamfont.
	A little Gnomish girl was out picking flowers this morning, smiling and happy to be outside.  Even though the Gnomes normally live underground some feel the urge to see and live above the ground, to watch the sky and feel the warm breeze of a spring day.  This little girl, Geraine, was like that.  She loved the smell and the look of the flowers near the windmills and tried her hardest to go there as often as possible.
	A shadow appeared next to her suddenly, but she paid no mind except to say, &#8220;Hello Watchman Mylz.&#8221;  She looked back to beam a smile at her favorite Watchman.
	Mylz was a well known and trusted Watchman among his peers, having the sole duty to watch the windmills.  Being he was alone he was busy, cleaning up after adventurers taking on more than they could handle or making sure a Kobold does not come close enough to the windmills to do any damage to them.  He lifted his armored face mask and replied, &#8220;Good day to you, Geraine.  Please be careful here.  There have been reports that the earth elementals that roam near by have increased in number recently and are branching out this way.&#8221;
	&#8220;Earth elementals?&#8221; she asked innocently.  She never heard of anything like that before.
	&#8220;Yes, earth elementals.  I don&#8217;t know much about them myself, but I think they come from another realm.  Just watch out for them, they tend to be mean and hurt very badly.&#8221;
	&#8220;Ok, I will Watchman Mylz!&#8221; she exclaimed as she got back to picking flowers.  Mylz smiled and walked back to his normal position.  Geraine hummed to herself as she picked and smelled the flowers around her, happy and content with her life and soon she skipped along to another patch of flowers.
	Time passed and soon Geraine wandered away from the windmills, out of earshot of Watchman Mylz, but her own little world kept her going, loving every second of being outside on such a beautiful day.  After a while, another shadow appeared.  Geraine was about to say hello to Mylz when an unnatural voice said, &#8220;Time to die.&#8221;
	Geraine turned and screamed as she confronted a large floating creature that was made from rock and dirt.  It was huge and towering, twice the size of any Gnome she had ever seen.  She fell back, terrified, as the large creature raised a fist to strike her.
	In the distance a cloud of dust arose into the air, growing in size with each passing second.  Geraine could almost hear the sound of a drum and singing when the cloud came up to them and out jumped a tall creature, smashing the first one in the back.
	&#8220;Ow!&#8221; yelled the second.  &#8220;That hurt!&#8221;
	&#8220;Bards are a plague on this realm!&#8221; shouted the first creature as it turned to see where the attack came from.
	Rubbing its shoulder for a moment the second creature said, &#8220;Sure, whatever,&#8221; and put the drum away, unsheathing a sword and drawing a shield from its back.  &#8220;Come and get me.&#8221;
	From behind the second creature came more like him, and another creature like the first only made of air.  It swooshed past the now armed tall creature to attack the rock creature.  It wasn&#8217;t as big as the rock creature, but it was fast.  The tall one and its friends surrounded the rock creature and began to attack it, chipping away at it and casting magical spells, which burned and chilled it.  Within a matter of moments, the rock creature crumbled to the ground, sputtering gibberish as its mouth fell apart.
	Geraine stared in disbelief, unsure of what to do or say when a voice asked, &#8220;Are you ok?&#8221;  She looked up to see the first creature standing over her with his hand extended.  She timidly took it and was lifted up onto her feet.  It then kneeled before her and smiled.  &#8220;You look a little bruised, but you should be fine.&#8221;
	&#8220;What are you doing out here, little girl&#8221; asked another of the tall creatures, even taller than the first with lighter skin.  &#8220;Are you lost?&#8221;
	&#8220;I&#8230;I&#8230;&#8221; she sputtered out in her native tongue.  She was scared and did not understand what they were saying.
	The first smiled and replied, &#8220;Name Bosk.  Forgive&#8230;um&#8230;bad Gnome speak.&#8221;
	Geraine looked puzzled.  &#8220;He&#8230;hello Bosk,&#8221; she replied.
	He smiled and turned to his friends and shouted, pointing to the windmills then turned to her again as the tall light skinned one ran off.  &#8220;It ok.  She get Mylz.&#8221;
	&#8220;MYLZ!&#8221; she exclaimed.
	Bosk smiled and began to hum a soothing melody.  Geraine was entranced by it and stared into Bosk&#8217;s eyes.  Soon she was almost asleep when she heard Mylz screaming.
	&#8220;What happened here?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;And who are you all?&#8221;
	Bosk continued humming as one of his comrades spoke.  &#8220;I am Andriana, High Elf Paladin.  These are my friends, Elventear, Revea, Alfadar, and the one humming to the little girl is named Bosk.  We were headed to the Minotuar Caves to help keep them in check when we saw the earth elemental and heard her scream.&#8221;
	&#8220;I see,&#8221; replied Mylz.  Both spoke in Common Tongue to understand one another.  &#8220;Geraine, what did I say about coming out this far?&#8221;
	Bosk quieted his humming to slowly bring her back to herself.  &#8220;I&#8230;I wanted to pick the flowers&#8230;&#8221; she muttered in Gnomish.  Bosk eased her into his arms and lifted her up, still humming softly.
	&#8220;Elves like you ruined your lands!  You&#8217;ll not ruin mine!&#8221; shouted a Kobold scout as he led three runts with him to attack the band of Elves.  The four Kobolds howled as their burly, ape-like bodies with dog-like heads charged into the shallow valley.
	Elventear turned around and focused, blasting one of the runts with a powerful force of energy.  The runt fell back and was still, dead from the forceful impact.  Revea looked to her elementaling and it responded, &#8220;Attacking master.&#8221;  She smiled and began to focus on the scout, hitting it with a particularly powerful shock of blades spell, weakening it just enough for the elementaling to finish it off in one hit.  It then turned on the last two runts.  They died running away in fear.
	&#8220;Impressive,&#8221; commented Mylz.
	Bosk set Geraine down near Mylz and tried to speak in the Gnomish tongue, partly to practice and partly so Geraine would understand.  &#8220;Thank you, Watchman Mylz.  We&#8230;uh&#8230;hope Geraine will be&#8230;ok.&#8221;
	Geraine smiled and replied, &#8220;I will.  Thank you.&#8221;
	Mylz turned sharply as screams came from the windmills.  &#8220;What?  What is going on.&#8221;
	&#8220;Minotaurs,&#8221; said Alfadar, peering into the distance.  &#8220;They are attacking the windmills.&#8221;
	Bosk grabbed Geraine, helping her over his shoulder and telling her to hold on to his neck, and invited Mylz to join the group.  At first Mylz thought to refuse but he saw Bosk beginning to play Selo&#8217;s Accelerando, speeding up the movements of those within the group, and quickly nodded, saying, &#8220;Come on, they need help.&#8221;
	There were six Minotaur slavers attacking the windmill.  The leader held aloft his axe and snorted, &#8220;Meldrath commands these mills be destroyed!&#8221;  They charged the mills, two of them attacking each mill in order to cripple the Gnomish processing of their metals.
	The people around the mills ran, except for a brave few that tried to fight back.   Jogl Doobraugh was out to meet them with Charlotte, his mechanical pet.  &#8220;Get them Charlotte!&#8221; he shouted.  Charlotte buzzed and whirred in acknowledgement of the command and jumped to the nearest Minotaur, piercing its skin with metal fangs numerous times.  The Minotaur howled in pain and began to beat the clockwork spider, trying to either damage it enough to cease its functioning or to knock it from him.  Finally another Minotaur came and knocked Charlotte off.  She landed on her back and tried her best to reorient herself, but was unsuccessful.
	&#8220;Help Charlotte!&#8221; Frugo Prigdish commanded his pet.  The earth elemental flew over to the clockwork spider and reoriented her before the Minotaurs got to them.  They both then turned to attack the Minotaurs.
	There were four Minotaurs left free the attack, one per windmill for the first two and two for the last one.  Frugo was helping his elemental with one Minotaur while Jogl helped Charlotte.  The remaining four split up and stormed inside the windmills, ready to do Meldrath&#8217;s bidding.
	&#8220;Meldrath commands,&#8221; said the leader as he burst into the nearest windmill to the Minotaur Caves.  He approached the central turning spoke of the windmill and raised his axe to into the air.  &#8220;For Meldrath&#8230;&#8221;
	Alfadar took aim and let loose and arrow, piercing the Minotaur through the forearm.  He howled in pain and dropped his axe, then turned to see his attacker.  Andriana and Alfadar stood at the door, waiting for the Minotaur.
	&#8220;Come on, big boy,&#8221; she said as she hefted her rusty two-handed sword.  The Minotaur charged them, enraged at the pain throbbing from his arm and that he might not be able to fulfill Meldrath&#8217;s wishes.  Alfadar hung his bow over his shoulders and drew his Minotaur battle-axe, a trophy from a previous encounter with a Minotaur slaver, and both Elves met him.  The Minotaur was large and strong, but lacked the free will and the ability to think creatively.  Alfadar let loose two flame lick spells, singeing the Minotaur badly as he cut deeply into it while Andriana expertly cleaved into the Minotaur&#8217;s thick thigh, slicing clean to the bone.  The Minotaur howled in pain and then countered with a few well-placed punches, but he was outmatched and outclassed.
	Alfadar blocked most of the punches thrown to him with his shield, slashing at the Minotaur when he could.  His blows landed mainly on the Minotaur&#8217;s arms, only rarely passing through the defense it was barely able to keep up.
	Andriana eased behind the Minotaur, biding her time to make a powerful strike.  Occasionally the Minotaur would attempt to turn to see what she was doing, but Alfadar quickly redoubled his efforts to busy it.  He saw what she was doing and knew that he had to keep the Minotaur busy in order for her to do it.  As soon as she was ready, Andriana hefted her 2 handed sword to her side, point aiming for the Minotaur&#8217;s back, and threw herself with all her might; thrusting her sword through it&#8217;s back and out its stomach, stopping just inches from Alfadar.  Andriana placed a foot on the Minotaur&#8217;s back and pushed, withdrawing her sword and forcing it to its knees.
	Soon the Minotaur fell face first to the ground and whimpered, &#8220;Soon I will die&#8230;Meldrath,&#8221; and went limp.
	Andriana sighed, smiled and said, &#8220;Nice job, brother.&#8221;
	&#8220;Thanks, you too,&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s see if the others need help.&#8221;
	In the second windmill, Elventear, Revea and her air elementaling were attacking the Minotaur.  The elementaling kept punching the Minotaur with a forceful blast of air while the Minotaur ended up hitting, quite literally, air as the elementaling dodged this way and that.  The Minotaur let loose two punches, trying to hit the elementaling, but it ducked low and gathered a gust of wind around its fists, then punched up and let loose a furious upper cut with two columns of gale-like winds.  The Minotaur was taken back a bit by the attack while Elventear and Revea stood back and let loose a volley of spells to damage the Minotaur from a safe distance.  Revea focused her will and created a large flame bolt, casting it to the Minotaur and causing massive burns on its left side then followed it with a shock of blades spell, hitting the massive creature on his right side.
	The Minotaur charged Revea, seeing it was futile to attack the wind elementaling.  He was almost upon her when he felt his feet stick to the ground.
	&#8220;That should hold him,&#8221; commented Elventear, finishing his casting of a root spell.
	Revea calmed her heart after a moment and replied, &#8220;Then lets finish this.&#8221;
	Elventear nodded in agreement and focused his will into his hands, forming a ball of pure force, then let it go, hitting the Minotaur hard and almost knocking him back, if not for the root spell.  The elementaling came up behind the Minotaur, brought its hands together, and gave it one more solid hit.  The Minotaur fell to his knees, bleeding from numerous burns and bruised all over from the forceful blows of the air elementaling, then he collapsed, dead.
	&#8220;Well, that was exhilarating,&#8221; commented Elventear.
	&#8220;I have to admit, it does get the blood going,&#8221; she replied with a smile.
	&#8220;You two ok?&#8221; asked Andriana, looking in to see the Minotaur corpse and the elementaling fading away into the air.  &#8220;Is that supposed to happen?&#8221;
	Revea turned and chuckled.  &#8220;Yes, sister.  When he isn&#8217;t needed he goes out of sight.&#8221;
	&#8220;Ah&#8230;I see.  Come on, I think there is still two more unaccounted for,&#8221; she replied.
	&#8220;Well come on!&#8221; shouted Elventear.  &#8220;Lets go!&#8221;
	Bosk and Watchman Mylz were in a heated battle with two Minotaurs.  Bosk had set Geraine down before they entered and told her to get the nearest Watchmen.  The Gnome and the Elf both fought hard, Mylz being more successful than Bosk.
	&#8220;I am NOT a fighter,&#8221; he thought as his Minotaur connected a solid punch to his rib cage while he had his sword raised to strike.  &#8220;I can&#8217;t win with brute force, the Hymn of Restoration can not compete with the damage he is doing, and nothing else I can do can cope with him.  Best to&#8230;wait a minute.&#8221;  Bosk backed up and turned to jump into a sprint, beginning to sing Selo&#8217;s Accelerando again.  As he ran, he sheathed his sword and threw his shield over his shoulder to free his hands to play the hand drum in his bag.  The addition of the drum intensified the bubble of sound around him, increasing his running speed vastly.  Within moments the Minotaur was a good distance behind him so Bosk put his hand drum away and began to pace himself to keep a steady distance between him and the Minotaur.
	&#8220;Meldrath commands!&#8221; roared the Minotaur.
	&#8220;Yeah, yeah,&#8221; thought Bosk, &#8220;we heard you the first time.&#8221;  He saw Alfadar out of the corner of his eye and shouted in Elvish, &#8220;When I shout now, let him have it everyone.&#8221;
	They replied with affirming comments and readied their weapons and spells.  Andriana went to help Mylz with the other Minotaur, leaving Alfadar, Revea, and Elventear to attack.  Bosk saw it ahead of him, the way to stun this Minotaur enough for one attack to finish him.  He quickly switched his song from Selo&#8217;s Accelerando to Elemental Rhythms, which helped protect him from fire and cold, as well as giving him some mystical protection.
	A barrier formed around him as he thought, &#8220;I hope this thing is hot enough,&#8221; as he stopped just before a major steam fissure.  &#8220;Come on you simple minded beast.&#8221;  The Minotaur was almost upon him when he jumped back through the steam, giving him a minor boost into the air, and landed behind it with only a mild warming sensation and shouted, &#8220;NOW!&#8221;
	Alfadar let loose one last flame lick, depleting his current supply of mana for the moment, while Revea cast a less powerful burn spell to conserve her what little mana remained in her and Elventear again cast a furor spell.  All these spells, with the addition of the searing heat from the fissure, hit at once in a powerful blow, killing the last Minotaur instantly.
	Bosk fell back onto his rear, his adrenaline still pumping somewhat.  &#8220;That&#8230;was interesting.&#8221;
	&#8220;You ok, hon?&#8221; shouted Revea.
	Bosk rubbed his rib cage gently and responded, &#8220;In the loosest sense, I suppose so.&#8221;
	&#8220;Nice job!&#8221; replied Elventear.
	Bosk hobbled over to the Minotaur and dragged the corpse out to see if there was anything of interest.  There was not much, only a few coins of copper and silver to split among the group.  He then stumbled down to the rest of the group, humming lightly the melody to the Hymn of Restoration to supplement his healing up.
	Andriana and Mylz dragged the last Minotaur out from the windmill and let it drop to the ground.  &#8220;Well, well.  Thank you, kindly Elves for you assistance today.  I&#8217;ll make sure my people, especially the Eldritch Collective and Gemchoppers, hear about this.  I can&#8217;t guarantee a reward, but you are welcome to take what you can from the Minotaurs.  Normally I would take whatever I find on the bodies of those I killed, but you did well today my friends.&#8221;
	&#8220;We thank you, Mylz,&#8221; replied Bosk, &#8220;but there are enough corpses for everyone to rummage through.  Ok everyone choose your corpse.  I already had mine.&#8221;
	Geraine came around from a ridge near them and mumbled, &#8220;Mylz&#8230;&#8221;
	Mylz turned to look at her.  The color of her cheeks and skin was gone and her eyes were droopy.  She could barely stand let alone walk.  Right behind her was a large diseased rat, bidding its time for a meal.
	&#8220;Geraine!&#8221; shouted Mylz as he ran forward to slay the rat.  He was well protected from its bite with his armor and had nothing to fear, except Geraine dying.
	Bosk ran to her and took her into his arms again, singing his Hymn louder now for her to hear it, trying to keep her alive until he can get her help.  &#8220;Elventear!&#8221; he shouted through the melody of the Hymn, &#8220;I need some help here! Geraine&#8217;s been diseased!&#8221;
	Elventear was out of the windmill where he was looting quickly and ran to where Bosk was with Mylz and Geraine.  He focused on the little girl and used what little mana he had left from the extended battle to cure her.  She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling a cleansing wave wash through her, and then she looked up through half-closed eyes at Bosk and mumbled, &#8220;I&#8217;m sleepy&#8230;&#8221;
	Elventear fell back, being caught by Revea&#8217;s elementaling.  &#8220;You ok, dear?&#8221; she asked.
	&#8220;Oh sure, hon, just give me a moment to recover,&#8221; he replied.
	Alfadar and Andriana came back out, Andriana testing her new Minotaur axe.  She smiled and said, &#8220;I might give this a try for a while.&#8221;
	&#8220;What did I say, sis?  These axes are great weapons.&#8221;
	Bosk held Geraine closely and gently caressed her forehead and hair as she began to fall asleep, then looked at Mylz and asked, &#8220;Where are her parents?&#8221;
	&#8220;Gone,&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;They left when she was only a baby to explore the world and find adventure, only Geraine here could not go.&#8221;
	&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Bosk.
	&#8220;She was to young for traveling, especially in this day and age, but they could not wait.&#8221;
	&#8220;Did they abandon her?&#8221; asked Andriana, approaching both of them.
	&#8220;Yes and no.  They wanted to start adventuring as soon as possible and return for Geraine when she was older.&#8221;  Mylz paused for a moment and then continued, &#8220;They just haven&#8217;t returned yet.&#8221;
	&#8220;How awful!&#8221; exclaimed Revea.
	&#8220;They were good people, they really were.  The Gemchoppers believe that they may have met a bad end.&#8221;
	&#8220;But they could they still be alive?&#8221; asked Alfadar.  &#8220;Right?&#8221;
	&#8220;I suppose so, but there is no guarantee.  If they were found I am sure that the Eldritch Collective would be grateful for any kind of help that you may be able to provide, as well as the Gemchoppers I would believe.&#8221;
	Bosk smiled and replied, &#8220;It would be an honor to help this poor little girl.&#8221;
	&#8220;Yes, it would,&#8221; said Andriana.
	&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Mylz.  He looked to Geraine in Bosk&#8217;s arms and continued, &#8220;I can see she will be just fine with you Elves.&#8221;
	Bosk looked up to his friends and said, &#8220;Shall we head off?&#8221;
	They looked at each other and nodded, getting ready to head to Greater Faydark to prepare for the adventure before them.  It would be challenging to find Geraine&#8217;s parents, having a few years lead way, but they would do everything in their abilities to do find her parents and reunite them.<div class=byline>-- <a href="mailto:alcasey@delta.is.tcu.edu">Bosk</A></div></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
