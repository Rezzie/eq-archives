Brad McQuaid talked about the new upcoming zone "The Warrens" twice today in a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064830.html">thread located on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><I>I said not this patch, but the next.<br><br>We continue to both battle test it, and we're also experiementing with some different rule-sets that we might make applicable to the zone and future zones.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>Here's the follow-up post:<UL><i>Grimstaff: Probably not to the degree that would make you happy, no. While we continue to improve internal testing, I don't foresee us ever getting to the point where we can internally test new content added to an already huge post-release game such that it's always launched problem-free.<br><br>I realize some players have a problem acknoledging, understanding, and accepting this, but I'm pretty convinced it's going to be true for MMOGs for quite some time. It's simply not realistic to hire hundreds if not thousands of internal testers, nor to beta test new content for months. <br><br>The more complicated these games become, the easier it is to implement something that has ramifications we didn't think of, or bugs or other issues that were undetectable before hundreds of thousands of people interact with the new content.<br><br>And, as mentioned in another recent post, if adding new content, features, and ideas to a hugely complicated, dynamic, evolving, post-release game means that at times players are both paying customers and 'beta testers', then so be it.<br><br>The alternative (stagnation) is something neither we as developers nor the majority of our customers find acceptable.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

Bryan informed us of the following event:<BLOCKQUOTE>A Hex I Cast Upon Thee!<br><br>A Morell-Thule Role Playing Event brought to you by The AnDarim<br><br>    Hear Ye!  Hear Ye!  Let it be known that the Lady Torynth Artavia is in search of brave souls to rescue her beloved Caleryn, Lord of The AnDarim from a horrible hex cast upon him! <br><br>It seems a few days ago, Caleryn ran into a fearsome troll who had taken over Captain Linarius&#8217; bridge in North Karana and was holding the guards prisoner.  Caleryn, being the brave yet sometimes impulsive druid that he is, took it upon himself to free the Captain from the clutches of this evil troll.  A titanic struggle ensued and when the dust had settled, Lord Artavia was victorious.  The Captain and his guards had been freed, but it came at a cost.  Babum, the evil troll shaman had cast a hex upon Caleryn before he disappeared, and a strange feeling came over the druid.  He immediately set out for Freeport to counsel with Petros, Cleric of Darr about the hex.  However as he ran through the Commonlands his joints began to seize, and bark began to grow across his skin, by the time he reached Freeport, he managed to utter the name of his attacker before he succumbed to the magic and is now firmly rooted as a tree in Freeport.<br><br>Lady Artavia seeks brave adventurers to hunt down the evil troll and find a cure for her husband and thus gain the respect and undying gratitude of The AnDarim.<br><br>[OOC: This Role-Playing Event will take place, Saturday, March 10th at 2pm EST and start at the gates in EAST Freeport.  The event is geared towards Levels 12-18 approx.  All those up to 18 are invited, just be wary of the range it is geared towards.

You need to know how I feel. Simply not mentioning my opinions certainly won't change them. <br><br>The point is that my opinions are not important enough to hide.

I'm sure you have also been well rewarded for your ingenuity and hard work. I don't know if the size of those rewards have made you complacent like wealthy linebackers who seem to avoid taking the risks that were taken by their predecessors, but something has gone horribly a miss.]</i></font> <br><br>No, we are not content with our success. We want you to keep playing after the competition has come and gone. And we know that we have to work to earn that. But if you'd like to pay me a few million every three years, I could learn to get complacent&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A little context.]</i></font> <br><br>I am willing to accept your words at face value. Nobody here ever needs to give me credentials.<br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Please, do not get defensive, but in my humble opinion, your customer service is woeful. "How can that be? We have such a high retention rate. Things must be pretty good." <br>Can you do queries on your user logs to determine how many of those accounts are still being used by original owners?]</i></font> <br><br>Well, considering that transferring an account is against our rules&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Here is my hypothesis. Few accounts are truly canceled. Many are either sold on Ebay or absorbed into a guild. I know the guild with whom I play is supporting at least 1/2 dozen "canceled" accounts since they provide good utility in terms of "porting", "resurrections," "mez-on-demand," etc.]</i></font> <br><br>Again, such things are against the UELA (I think that's the acronym). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Many people who play your game are, quite frankly, addicted. I do not disparage them but this subset of your customer-base is largely unaffected by poor customer service. They will argue and complain, but do little else. However, when a suitable alternative to your product is available, they will likely shift their addiction in that direction. What about Ashron's call? Quite frankly, that game, from what I hear, doesn't hold a candle to what EQ was (pre expansions) It just wasn't good enough to peel away your customer base.]</i></font> <br><br>Fair enough. I'll accept that there are customers (and not just customers of Verant, but just customers in general) that will be satisfied with very little customer service. I will also concede that there are a group of players that have already reached the end of their time with our game and will move on when a suitable alternative comes along. But I would argue that their reactions have little to do with customer service, and everything to do with the kind of customers they are (neither good nor bad, just their nature). Some people will move on to the next best thing regardless of what we do, and others have played themselves out on EverQuest. We do our best to retain these people, obviously. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think the major issues with the game came when you expanded the characters beyond lvl 50 in an enviornment that was never designed to support it. You have major balance issues between melee and casters because of the wealth of melee items and the relative scarcity of both spells and caster items.]</i></font> <br><br>I disagree. I think that the environment could support extended levels. Though I readily admit that the implementation of those extended levels wasn't perfect. That does not reflect the ability of the game to support such expansion. It only exposes the fact that we need to work more on making it work. We've already made several strides to reach that goal, and I think we'll have it all fixed up soon enough. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am starting to delv into the minutia and that is not my intent so let me raise my points up a level. <br>I think you are doing a terrible job of communicating with your customers. I am a customer and that is my perception. Many here seem to have the same perception. Perceptions of one's customers is reality...trust me it is. Your customers feel you are adversarial with them. They believe that you think they will destroy "your" game with their unbalanced ideas. Perhaps you are right...but they (we) are the customers so how do you communicate your concerns while answering ours.]</i></font> <br><br>I'll have to take your word on that. I don't see that myself, but then again I work here. But I talk to customers a lot, and I get a different feeling about it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'd like to offer a couple suggestions and then provide a small case-study to illustrate why the implementation of such suggestions (or ones similar) are needed. <br>I think Alan's idea for "Talk" threads was a good one. That said, I do not believe Verant Management provided him the support or infrastructure to make that good idea successful. This confuses me. If Verant's data is accurate then you have approximately 300,000 active accounts which equates to about $3 Million dollars in revenue monthly plus revenue from the sale of retail boxes at $16 - $50 each. Surely, even after expenses and R&D, there are enough funds to provide a robust and thoughtful customer support engine.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not in a position to argue company revenue with anyone. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I suggest that one member of your current staff be assigned as advocate to each class. Such a person should have as their mission in life to understand the wants and needs of that segment of customer.]</i></font> <br><br>So you are suggesting that we add another duty to each member of the dev team that they read all the class sites and become experts in the play of a certain class (which, it seems, would also require that they play that class up to 60th level on a live server)? They already do that. Every one of us plays the game. Members of the dev team play as many hours as anyone. And to insist that they spend their work time becoming activists for a certain class is rather silly. I think they should be developing content myself. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Each class should have an interactive page on the EQ website through which to see a regularly updated status on their issues.]</i></font> <br><br>I would argue that there aren't so many 'issues' as you seem to think. To keep up the kind of interaction you seem to want would be a full-time job. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You might say that you already have such advocates as part of your tuning team. Great! Tell us who they are. Have them engage us. You don't know how lucky you are to have a vibrant customer base that WANTS to tell you what they think. Most companies have to pay 3rd parties to find quasi-interested pseudo-customers who then provide their input...for a fee.]</i></font> <br><br>Heh, yes, I do say that we already have designers playing the game. But to call them advocates would be wrong. You see, and advocate is narrowly focused. His (or her) only desire or job is to push through narrow objectives. We can't do that. We have to look at the entire game. Narrowing your focus to just one class is counterproductive. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: These 14 folks would, of course, also have to maintain the objectivity one would expect of a Verant employee as opposed to a purist player. The "good-of-the-game" would temper the natural desire to advance the position of their advocacy group beyond what is reasonable.]</i></font> <br><br>Ah, sheesh, maybe I should read one paragraph ahead before responding&#8230; <br><br>Here's where you'll have to trust me. An advocate that is objective and looks for the good of the game, would be unable to please the players that truly feel that they need an advocate. If a player points out a problem and is logical about the problem, he doesn't need an advocate. That problem is a problem, regardless of the class of the player. <br><br>I've spent a lot of time lately getting to know the desires of the players that identify themselves with a particular class. I've written up those desires, purposefully excluding the ones that did not take into account the good of the game. And yet, as is obvious by your post, I am not considered an 'advocate' for any of them. Why is that? I have done as you have described. I have listened to the players, responded to them (over a longer period of time than I would have if I was only dealing with one class), and listed their concerns. I have been an 'advocate' as you described. <br><br>And yet, you clearly do not see me as such. <br><br>*shrug* <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The ideas put forth by the 14 would be managed similar to how Alan has started the "talk" threads, but much more actively so. Part of this open communication would include time lines and thoughts in process. I know companies think of their project plans as some kind of top secret document. "We can't share that with our customers; what if we miss our projected timelines?]</i></font> <br><br>Perhaps some do. We communicate them as we get them, for the most part. Sure, we keep some things secret because we truly believe that discovery is part of the game. The only thing that your advocate group could do better than one person could do (and I know, I'm that one person), is react more quickly to their&#8230; constituents. But the dev team is busy. Their work has to be done. If we added another duty to them, that of advocacy, then you might get faster responses, but they would be responses like, "well, I spent my morning responding to your e-mails and discussing your concerns with you on the message board, so I didn't have time to code in the changes you asked for&#8230;" <br><br>I don't see that as a better way to do things. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I would just love to see the look on one of my customer's faces if I told them I would not share my team's project schedule. Communicate with us; tell us what's up. If you miss a date...so what.]</i></font> <br><br>Wow. You either have never missed a date, or you just don't pay attention to the response from customers when you do. I don't mean to be harsh here, but you're out of touch. Nothing will get people more upset than missing a deadline. <br><br>But that's not the reason that we don't spend our time posting up each and every deadline. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It's a game to us, not a mission critical enterprise application.]</i></font> <br><br>Er&#8230; ok. But if it's just a game to you, then why do you need all this information. Why in the world would you need an advocate of all things, if it's just a game&#8230; <br><br>This is where the problem comes in. For us, this is a business. We have to take into account things like workload, priorities and such, for the whole project at hand. An individual player might only have interest in changes that affect him. So that player's desires will almost never match up with our timeline. It can't, no matter what we do. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Tell us why its going to be delayed and give us a new date. You know, I bet dimes to donuts that if the high-powered healing items were discussed in an open forum, even in general terms so as not to ruin the excitement, the uncomfortable issues you now face would have been avoided.]</i></font> <br><br>We do that now. There is no timeline about your class that you do not already know about. I've made a list, and we're looking at it. That's the timeline. Once we look at it, we'll let you know what's next. Nothing hidden here. I imagine that the problem is that we're not moving real fast on the issue that concerns the individual. We can't help that, we have to prioritize over the whole organization, not just one class. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So, to recap. <br>1) Verant employed, class specific, advocates.]</i></font> <br><br>We're not hiring fourteen new people to do this. Our dev team is too busy (as they should be). It's my job to try to be those fourteen people. And I can do it, I just can't do it as fast as fourteen people can. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Such advocates are either members of, or have significant input to, the tuning team.]</i></font> <br><br>They do. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) All issues managed by advocates are communicated and over-communicated to the interested community via class specific, verant managed, web pages.]</i></font> <br><br>Again, we don't think it's a good idea to hire fourteen new people to do this, and the ones we have are working on making the changes that you've asked for, rather than talking about them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Time lines for resolution to issues are published and any slippage communicated in a timely manner.]</i></font> <br><br>Again, I do that. It's just not happening as fast as you'd like. <br><br>[Much stuff about necromancers snipped.] <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: COMMUNICATE. State it. Tell us, "Ok...there are some problems with your class. We are committed to fixing them. It will take some time. Susan here is your primary contact at Verant and she will be working on your behalf. We will get all your ideas down and then follow-up with some dates and next steps. We will at least have the next steps posted for your feedback by date XYZ.]</i></font> <br><br>Um&#8230; <br><br>Here's where we have a problem. It's a pretty simple one, really. I have listed the problems that the classes have given me. We don&#8217;t know if we are committed to fixing all of them (or any of them) until we actually look them over and decide if they are indeed problems. You tell me that we should trust our customers. But, well, I know that you don't trust all of your fellow players to tell the absolute truth, or to look at the situation from a neutral place, for the good of the game. Sure, most do. But we still have to look at each idea and make certain that it is a problem and that the suggested solution works for the game as a whole. <br><br>So once we have taken a look at the list that I have compiled and decided which ones we are going to act on and which we are not, then I will come back to you with a revised list. No, I will not be listing dates. I think you are completely wrong about dates being a good idea. I'll certainly give timeframes, but they will be approximate. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Guys...this is basic business here. You will have amazed and delighted customers. You will develop loyalty that will enable you to retain customers through the release of "the next best thing." <br>Brad...when was the last time you delighted a customer? Why do people pay 2x as much to get a shirt at Nordstrom? Because Nordstrom strives every day to delight every customer. OMG..my dog ate my shirt and I have a meeting in Chicago; what am I going to do? As your checking into your hotel all stressed out, the clerk hands you a package from Nordstrom with a shirt, your size, in it,having been told of your dilemma and expressing the item to the hotel at no additional charge. This is not B.S. this happened. If Macy's has a sale on shirts tomorrow; will you see me there; hell no!]</i></font> <br><br>But we don't charge twice the price&#8230; I suppose if we did, then we could double the size of the EQLive team and hire people to be advocates. But that does not mean that our current system isn't good. I'm going to defend it, and only partially because that system is me. Even if there were fourteen people running around here insisting that changes be made to their class, the dev team would still have to sit down and evaluate the ideas presented. They are still going to have to get their daily tasks done. There is still going to be time between a request and a response. <br><br>As for amazing the customer, there's a problem with the advocate idea in that regard. Once the classes are 'balanced' the advocates are done. Perhaps these advocates would provide a sense of wonder about our customer relations for a while. But we can't continue to have an advocate for something like that once they've done their work. So what would we have to do next to bring that kind of wonder to the customers? <br><br>I agree that it would be a great thing to be able to hire your advocates. But it's impractical from a business standpoint. And when they were done there would be no practical way to keep up that level of interaction, and no real need. Yes, everyone wants to be heard. And we listen as best we can. But we can't have someone go to every customer's house and get their opinions first hand, either&#8230; <br><br>It's all about reasonable expectations. We meet those whenever we can. But we can't meet the unreasonable ones, even in the short term because we couldn't keep meeting them, and that would be a disappointment to our customers too.</UL>

It was young but husky, as if polished by years of hissing sand, hot desert days and cold desert nights. <P>"Aye, I have brought a basket of cactus pears I collected myself, and some apples that came from the orchards in far Yaraq." <P>"Yaraq? It is many months since I tasted a Yaraqi apple," replied the voice. "I lived there for a time when I first came from the Old World. Come, sir. Come into the cave, and perhaps we could keep each other company for a time." <P>So the young man stepped into the dark mouth of the cave, and as he did, he became aware of a tiny light like a firefly just ahead of him. As he progressed it kept always just beyond his reach, leading him further into the cave. The light it cast was scant, so the details of the cave were lost in deep shadow and black gloom. But he could see enough to know that the cave was more like a tunnel, and the floor was smooth enough that he suspected a path had been constructed for easy passage. </i><P>--------------<P>To view the nominees and detailed results <a href="http://www.roleplayfantasy.com/votefebresults.htm">click here</a>.

ChrisDC emailed me this announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Server: Mithaniel Marr <br>What: Crusade Against Guk. <br>When: Wednsday, March 7, 9:00 P.M. PST <br>Who: Anyone of any level and class. <br><br>Emerging from the dank depths of Lower Guk, where he had spent the last <br>several working to rid the froglocks of Guk from the scourge of their evil <br>undead brethren, Grumoth Stonehammer expected no less than a tankard of ale <br>and a stout, cheery welcome from those he had put his life on the line many <br>times for. As he walked through the hallways, he noticed that, though some <br>casually ignored him, completely indifferent to his existence, there were <br>others that still drilled into him with their beady eyes, as though they <br>meant to stab him in the back as soon as he turned from them. Sure enough, as <br>he tried to find his way through the winding, unfamiliar passageways, several <br>froglock knights sprung out at him, slashing with their swords and stabbing <br>with their rapiers. <br><br>Always on his guard, Grumoth fought back instantly, slaying two of the honorless froglocks before falling back. He was tired from <br>the recent fightings in Lower Guk, and those battles had taken a lot out of <br>him. He was in no condition to fight more than a few froglocks at a time, <br>despite his skills. As he turned to walk back, he felt the all too familiar <br>tingle in the air as a spell was cast upon him. It did not take hold, <br>however, and he saw its source: a froglock shaman standing in the middle of a <br>room ahead of him. Seeing no better direction to go, Grumoth charged ahead... <br>straight into a room full of knights. As they all came down upon him at once, <br>he made the most difficult decision he had ever made. For the first time in <br>his life, he ran from battle. Down the halls and corridors of the froglock <br>stronghold he flew, but not fast enough. At last, the blades of the pursuing <br>hoard struck the final blow. Grumoth died there in the decrepid, stinking <br>abyss known as Guk. The honorless froglocks whom he was there to protect, <br>shamelessly killed him. Now, reincarnated, Grumoth leads a crusade to rid the <br>land of the accursed race of intelligent frogs. Fueld by his anger and hatred <br>of the creatures, he fights without armor, without weapons, and without <br>remorse. It is no longer about skill, it is not about money, it is about the <br>riddance of Norrath's most ill-favored inhabitants. All froglocks must die. <br>He asks all that would work to rid the world of Mithaniel Marr of these foul <br>beasts to join him at the entrance to Guk on Wednsday, March 7, at 9:00 P.M. <br>PST. </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

The new sub-game option called Gems was implemented today and is the subject of a <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid983937429,83156,">new editorial</a> written by Rolli Polli.  Here's an excerpt<UL>Today EverQuest has reached an all time low. It&#8217;s not because of the <br>healing & hate changes, cleric breastplate nerfs, or even the upcoming <br>changes to the planes. It&#8217;s all because of one little game, called &#8220;Gems.&#8221; <br>For anyone who has been living under a rock, or just doesn&#8217;t read patch <br>messages, I&#8217;ll give you a brief rundown on Gems. Gems is a Tetris clone <br>that has been added to the EQ client. If you want to play the game, you <br>just type /gems. Yes, that&#8217;s right, Gems is a game within a game. <br>Honestly, it&#8217;s not a poorly done game, and has lots of neat little features.</UL>To comment on this editorial feel free to post your feedback on <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=9708995&start=9708995">this board thread</a>.

For your reference here is a copy of today's Patch Message:<UL>March 6th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*The Fan Faire comes home!*<br><br>The next EverQuest Fan Faire will be held April 6 - April 7, 2001 at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We expect this one to sell out quicker than Baltimore not only because the weather will be warmer, but also because it's a safe bet to say you'll get to meet even more Verant personalities since our offices are local. Don't delay with registration because you may get left out! <br><br>The registration deadline is March 28th.  Go to <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/fanfaire">http://www.station.sony.com/fanfaire</a> for details.<br><br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>*General Changes*<br><br>-- Doubled the chance gain skill points in skills that are above 200. <br>-- Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal's Breatplate on others once casted upon yourself.<br>-- The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by SKs<br>-- Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via /book or alt+b.<br>-- Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.<br>-- New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One on Antonica and two others on Kunark.  NPCs at these locations can fill you in on the details.  Good hunting.<br>-- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the "Celestial Healing" effect has been increased to one minute.  We understand that this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch.  We did, however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and kept on the group tank.  When we've decided on the new affect, it will be applied to those items retroactively.  <br>-- Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for skill values over 100.  Values under 100 still show the qualitative identifiers.<br>-- Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other players.  You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other players by typing /inspect. <br>-- Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over the chat window.<br>-- Fixed "Breath of the Sea". It was mistakenly set to be unresistable.<br>-- Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone.  This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists and clean up your pet.<br>-- "Voice Graft" will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) of your pet.<br>-- You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged.<br>-- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125.  It was the intent for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however before the scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better.  With the tracking improvements from the last patch, this increase was appropriate.<br>-- Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing.<br><br>*NPC AI Adjustments*<br><br>-- Level 60 players with the taunt skill will now have a chance to taunt creatures that are level 60 to 65.  Previously, players could only taunt creatures below their level.<br>-- NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount of hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their enemies.  Prior to this, they would add full hate when they saw you do this.  This is why NPCs would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez.<br>-- Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much "temporary hate" when a player would sit down in front of them.<br>-- The maximum amount of "hate" that an NPC can add when witnessing a heal to targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.<br>-- Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the number of hitpoints healed.  Previously, healing one hitpoint would cause one point of hate.  Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points of hate.<br><br>*Velious Music*<br><br>Velious subscribers should run the Velious Patch to pick up new mood music for some Velious Zones.  Let us know what you think of the new compositions. <br><br>*EQGems*<br><br>A new "mini-game" has been added to the EverQuest client.  EQGems is our first effort aimed towards allowing people to engage in different activities while playing EverQuest.  Based upon the success of EQGems, we may explore opportunities for other mini-games in the future, even some that are multiplayer in and of themselves.  Type /gems to play.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Yesterday's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064737-2.html">thread started by Alan</a> on handing in quest items has been split.

"You have turned in the wrong or incomplete items, would you like them back?".]</i></font> <br><br>Right now we don't know if it is our intent to change multi-questing. That would be the whole point of this thread. <br><br>Despite your misdirected anger, you might have a good idea. I'll mention it to the team. <br><br>Ludovic wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If noone in the group can use the item, and since multiquesting is out...

Is it somehow less acceptable that some random person gets to be twinked than some high level person's twink? Is it less acceptable that the low level character get the item than the high level character that can't be bothered to show up and get the item himself? <br><br>And the chances of someone getting a quest done in its entirety this way at a level way too low is extremely slim. And removing multi-questing will not have much of an effect on this anyway. Those high level people wouldn't be hunting that NPC unless one of them wants the item anyway. <br><br>Hasuko wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -This is a multiplayer game that is supposed to encourage grouping and personal interraction. Multi-questing is a part of that.]</i></font> <br><br>Not really. It's not part of 'grouping' at all. If I'm grouped with you, I can loot the item in question and there is no multi-questing needed. Though I can see that it does promote interaction in some ways between people that might not have met otherwise. But those cases are rare. For the most part, muti-questing is done by people that know each other already. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -Loss of items is regrettable, but I don't think they occur with all that much frequency that would warrant changing this aspect of the game.]</i></font> <br><br>If it didn't happen with some frequency, we wouldn't be talking about it. It certainly happens enough to make it worth talking about. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -The real problem lies with higher level people camping hard to get items (i.e. The Ring of the Ancients) and then auctioning them in East Commons or GFay at the expense of other players working hard to get the items. That cheapens some quests.]</i></font> <br><br>Agreed. Obviously my personal opinion (again, personal, meaning just me) is that multi-questing is one of those things that, in general, cheapens the game. It allows people to basically split quests up so that the guy getting the reward isn't even doing most of the questing. But that's just my personal opinion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -However, if two or more friends work together to complete a quest and turn in the items so one person gets the reward, then that is well within the spirit of player interraction.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, those friends are not working together if they are multi-questing. They are working separately. They are not interacting at all. If they were together doing each part of the quest, they wouldn't need to multi-quest. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -Another example: Guildmember-01 is in a raid in the castle in Mistmoore, and they get the werewolf claws. Guildmember-02 is a warrior that needs crafted armor. Guildmember-02 buys the rubies, then Guildmember-01 turns in the werewolf claws and Guildmember-02 turns in the rubies and gets the crafted BP is a perfectly legitimate example of teamwork and the spirit of multi-player cooperation.]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, that is an example of teamwork. And I'm not saying that it's a bad thing. But it is basically circumventing the quest (again MY opinion, not that of the team). <br><br>The concern that someone mentioned, the link-dead group member that just can't loot the item that he did work hard to achieve, that's a real concern for me. That person would not be able to get the item (or have someone get it for him), and would lose the chance. In this case, I'm in favor of multi-questing. <br><br>Gestaltmind wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are you even bothering asking us when you have almost certainly already made up your mind?]</i></font> <br><br>Then why bother replying if you are so convinced that we've already made up our minds? <br><br>You'll note that we want to talk about this. When we are set to change something, we'll just do it. Some decisions can't be made by a committee of 300,000. We'll make those decisions and move on. But in cases where we want input, we ask for it. The fact that you assume we don't want to hear your opinion is both silly and false. <br><br>AuntieShaynta wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Third things third: eliminating multi-questing is wrong. There are at least 2 quests I'm aware of that virtually require it. The "Orc Illegible Cantrip" quest in West Freeport that requires 2 of a Lore Item to be handed in, and a necro quest which I believe runs from Paineel that requires good faction with Halas (don't know details, just that a friend has asked me to help him with this).]</i></font> <br><br>I would argue that those quests are broken if they _require_ multi-questing to complete, and should be changed anyway, regardless of what happens here. By themselves, such quests are not really a good reason not to remove multi-questing.

But please refrain from active attempts to disrupt it. <br><br>Stumppuller wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Removing multi-questing is guaranteed to break a number of quests, since a lot of quests were implemented with it in mind as a necessary feature. For just one example, it would break the Paladin Soulfire quest (which in turn would break the Paladin Epic Weapon Quest, since it relies on the Fiery Avenger quest which relies on Soulfire). Why? Because to do an early, necessary stage of the quest, you must give four LORE Drom's Champagnes to the drunk Tyklar Renlon in East Freeport. The only way to do this is to give him one, hit Give, then quickly buy another from the nearby bartender, hand that one over, repeat repeat. This only works because of the multi-questing feature.]</i></font> <br><br>Then that quest sounds broken to me. How silly is it to have it set up that way?

Amano Jyaku informed me of this event:<BLOCKQUOTE>Do you ever wish there was something to do besides <i>kill stuff?</i>  Do you like talking to people?  Do you like boozing it up?  Do you want to gather at a large, mobile social event for one night?<br> <br>This is your chance.  <br> <br>Grab a couple plat out of the bank (you'll only need a couple most likely), and come on out and join the <b>Pan-Antonican Pub Crawl</b> on <b>Saturday, March 17th at 1 pm Pacific time</b> (that's 4 pm eastern, 2 pm mountain, 3 pm Central).<br> <br>We're going from Freeport to Halas, on foot, no sow, no teleports, and we're going to hit up every single merchant along the way for more booze.  Our crack team of druids has already mapped, charted, logged and noted the entire route, and there are no less than 25 stops along the way for the frothy brew.  See Antonica the way it was meant to be seen: on foot from one end to the other (and through beer goggles).  <br> <br>Come and meet other player characters and chatter.  Bring your stories, your boasts, your grudges, your pick-up lines, and a couple empty backpacks to hold extra drink as we move along.  And be warned that this is gonna last a while, it took the druid scouting team over 2 hours to track down all the merchants, and they had Spirit of the wolf!  Fortunately the merchant locations are all marked now, so we won't have to go searching... and when we finally arrive in Halas, if you've got the stomach, prepare yourself for a steinhoist that promises to kill at least a few of you!<br> <br>Experience the fun of trying to navigate down a 900 foot chasm while staggeringly drunk!  If you thought Kithicor at night was scary before, try it when you can't SEE anything!  Your liqour and your friends will keep you warm as you weave through the Everfrost Peaks.  We might even have to see if we can't find some of those elusive brewers in Blackburrow and mug them for their highly prized Stout, but no promises. ;)<br> <br>So be in West Freeport in the secret tunnel north of the newbie area at the designated date and time, you know, the big round room with a water-covered floor.<br> <br>A couple notes:<br>1) we won't be hunting for loot or exp. We may have to kill a few beasties along the way for extra cash to buy more hair-a-the-dog-that-bit-ya though.<br> <br>2) Try not to die along the way.  Every effort will be made by the rest of us to keep you alive, but if you throw yourself at a guard in highpass just for giggles don't expect us to wait up for you. We got booze to find, man!<br> <br>3) I realize that some of you may be KOS to some of the merchants we visit, and we'll try to work around it as best we can, but there's only so much that can be done and yet still maintain the event.  And if you're KoS in Halas, my sincere apologies :(  Maybe next time the Pub Crawl can end up in Grobb or something.<br> <br>4) Due to time constraints, we won't actually be including the booze merchants in Freeport in this trip. There are just too many, we'd never get outside the city gates.  The trip starts outside freeport, and we go from there. <br> <br>5) for more questions, please contact Amano-Jyaku on the Out-of-character messageboard at <a href="http://www.ralloszek.net">http://www.ralloszek.net</a><br> <br>Thanks, and hope to see you there!<br>-Amano Jyaku<br>Seekers of Divinity<br>Rallos Zek Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

That is certainly not our intent. The changes to these healing items are being made in quick succession due to the simple fact that we have reevaluated the idea of healing powers given to items, and for no other reason. <br><br>Cassie_Unforgiven wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I would love to see an official post from VI stating they will do exchanges and/or reset faction.]</i></font> <br><br>I can address the faction issue. There were/are alternate ways to get those items. The faction loss was a choice the player made to get the item one way rather than the other. We won't be changing any factions over this. <br><br>Exchanges (or perhaps just changing all existing instances of these items) are something that we are reevaluating. When we've come to a decision on what the replacement effect will be, we'll then decide about how to deal with existing items.</UL>

This is news to note for those <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627.html">attempting to hand in a quest item</a>:<UL><I>I wanted to talk to all of you about the way turning in quest items works. We are thinking about making a change here, and I'd like to talk about it.<br><br>Let me set up a fictional example. Let's say that there is a quest NPC that gives out the final item for the quest in exchange for three other items. Currently, if you give the NPC two of the correct items and a third item that you think is the correct item but isn't, the NPC will take all of the items and give you nothing. This seems like a rude thing for the NPC to do.<br><br>Also, if someone has come along and given the NPC one of the three items before you arrive, and you give him the three correct items all at once he'll give you the quest result, but the person that gave the one item previously will get nothing (the NPC is, basically, letting you complete the transaction that he started).<br><br>Both of these situations cause someone to lose out. That's not something that we like.<br><br>We've been thinking about making a change to the way this whole turning in quest items thing works. The most reasonable and eloquent solution to this problem would be to simply have the NPC give the items back if they are not enough to complete the quest. This would mean that if you give him one item, he would give it back to you and tell you that he needs more than just that item to give you what you want. If you give him two correct items and an incorrect item, he would give the quest items back to you and tell you that you made a mistake (he might or might not give you back the mistaken item, depending on the technical ability to get him to do that).<br><br>This would fix a bunch of problems with questing. But, as you all have probably guessed, it would eliminate the ability to 'multi-quest'. We know that the whole concept of multi-questing is a touchy one.<br><br>So I have a question for you. Would eliminating the problems with losing quest items to NPCs be worth the loss of the ability to multi-quest?<br><br>Alan</I></UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627.html">Click here</a> to jump to that thread.

From Safka Fairheart:<BLOCKQUOTE>Two new episodes this week as the chapters "The Blood of Friends" and "The <br>Lair Beneath" continue, so be you a newcomer to our tale or an avid follower <br>please drop by a take a read . .<br><br>* The Blood of Friends Part 4 *<br><br>A great-carved platform stood out from the centre of the platform. Judging <br>by the foliage arranged atop it, Safka could only imagine that it was the <br>resting-place of the dragon herself. A series of ornate steps lead up to <br>smaller man sized platform some twelve paces or so above the main structure.<br><br>&#8220;That must be some form of audience area,&#8221; Safka guessed, &#8220;so that you can <br>speak to the dragon at it&#8217;s eye level.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Heh,&#8221; laughed Iste, &#8220;aye, I guess straining her neck to lean down to our <br>level might get a bit painful.&#8221;<br><br>The cleric smiled and nodded, &#8220;Although I don&#8217;t think she has had too many <br>visitors of late. Rumour of a place like this would spread like wildfire <br>amongst the adventurers of Norrath had any found it.&#8221;<br><br>A pair of the smaller dragons swooped down in a swift arc and landed before <br>them, immediately propping up on their hind legs and spreading their wings <br>to their full extension, barring their way any further down the path.<br><br>By now Iste was not surprised to find that they talked in common speak. Half <br>an hour before he might not have believed anyone who had told him of talking <br>dragons.<br><br>&#8220;Sssssstate your business.&#8221; Rasped the first of the dragons, pointing at <br>Safka with a curled claw.<br><br>&#8220;Your lady Gorenaire has invited us down to her home.&#8221; She explained bowing <br>serenely, and tugging Iste&#8217;s arm to make him bow as well.<br><br>The two dragons looked at each other briefly before the one that had <br>addressed them stepped forward.<br><br>&#8220;Invited you sssay?&#8221; it stated, looking them up and down, &#8220;ssstrange stature <br>of guests our lady seeks out today, bessst get to the audience podium then <br>you had. If you are lying ssshe will soon make dinner of you.&#8221;<br><br>The other dragon flapped its leather like wings excitedly. &#8220;Dinnerssss, yes <br>we have not eaten today, Elf tastes good from whats I remember.&#8221;<br><br>Safka gulped and looked at Iste<br><br>&#8220;Buts nothing to worry you if you are indeeds invited.&#8221; The first dragon <br>confirmed smirking, before turning to its brethren, &#8220;barbarian is too tough <br>though, not as sweet as the elf.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Well at least I would give them indigestion,&#8221; Iste leant over and whispered <br>to Safka.<br><br><br>* To read on visit us at <a href="http://safkaslore.webjump.com">http://safkaslore.webjump.com</a> *<br><br>Many Thanks<br><br>Safka Fairheart</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Safka! :)
