A monster of a post was made by Gordon this evening addressing I think virtually every Bard issue ever brought up on the Gameplay Board.  Because of it's length, I've posted a link to the exact post:<UL><i>Well "bugs" would have fit better given my attempt at aliteration, but "bugs" probably isn't a correct term given most of the contents.<br><br>Yesterday, someone here at the office sent me a copy of a complete list of bard issues from the "Concert Hall", which I believe is the busiest class-specifc bard board on the net. I answered the email, but thought that I should post my response here. Please forgive the nametags as it's not my usual format.<br><br>One thing I would like to note is that this same list (or one of the same format) came to the boards here around the beginning of June. At that time I addressed every issue, much as I am doing here. I'm a little dismayed to see some of the same issues that were labled "Working as intended" still on the list today. I'll have to ask the bards, if you want meaningful communication, we're going to have to agree to disagree on some of these issues and try to move forward on things that we can agree on. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>-Gordon</I><br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022892.html"><b>Click here for the vast majority of the Bard issues list</b></A></UL>

Here are the evening posts from Gordon Wrinn:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022869.html"><b>EQ Missing...Things</b></a><br>EverQuest wasn't designed to have the same feature-set of other games on the market. Feature-sets vary from product to product. <br><br>In this case, we chose to focus on the adventure aspect of the game rather than developing "virtual life".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022714.html"><b>Trees in Kunark</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'll be running along at my bardic speed, turn into some trees and just crawl as I hit 5 frames per second. Nothing else in kunark does this...not mobs, not dungeons, not cabilis...just the damn trees. And I could care less about the trees! The ones before kunark were fine, and didn't bring my system to a screeching halt! <br><br>Please do something...can't you tone down the tree models?]</i></font> <br><br>While the number of trees may indeed have an effect on framerate due to the number of polygons that need to be rendered, the animation of the trees doesn't appreciably affect framerate. <br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I have a PII 450 w/128 Megs of PC100 RAM, a Diamond Viper V550 16MB AGP TNT card, and a dedicated Wide Ultra Scsi drive for my EQ installation on my computer running Windows ME. I have no issues with trees and video performance problems at all. Only when I initially log on, I experience video lag briefly until images, textures, or whatever gets loaded into memory. Otherwise I have no problems at 1024x768 at all.]</i></font>  <br><br>That's basically what I've experienced. My FPS above is with the clipping plane all the way out, and never run as poorly as the original poster. I wonder if there may be something wrong with that system. <br><br>Rellic, do you have some of the more processor-intensive options, such as FSAA turned on?<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I have an Intel 966Mhz, GeForce 2 GTS 64mb, with 256mb of RAM, and a super fast UDMA100 7.2k rpm hard drive. My system kicks but on every game, except EQ in kunark where there are trees. I run in 800x600 with particle density off, 3d sky off, 3d sound off, and level of detail off. My system should allow for all of these to be turned on, but those darn trees in kunark just hammer me! ]</i></font><br><br>Given the system specs that you quoted, I really can't see why you would be experiencing much of a problem. I am personally running a P3/600, GeForce 2 GTS (32MB), in 1024x768, and don't drop below 20 FPS even in the densest areas. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022802.html"><b>Missing NPCs For Quests?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am seeing rumors of missing NPC for the druid/ranger quests on the message boards. I have read the test server has some NPC that the live server do NOT have. Is this true. You can tell us that at least. It does not in any way give away any info on the quest. Other than we should probaly wait till it is fixed before anyone trys for this weapon.]</i></font> <br><br>While I of course can't say for certain since every quest has not been completed by the test department on every Live server, all of the data underwent a full verify when the data was pushed live. It passed binary file-compares at that time, so I imagine that the chances of server-specific problems are limited to say the least.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022856.html"><b>Shaman Epic Weapon Proc</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If the proc will go off on first swing then why not be right click?]</i></font> <br><br>I don't believe that anyone ever said that the proc will go off on the first swing, did they? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: using bracer]</i></font> <br><br>This is a bit of a sore spot around the office at the moment. Some are of the opinion that the proc on the epic weapon is disliked directly due to the bracer.</UL>

Gordon had a busy night on the Gameplay Board.  Here's what he posted:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022595.html"><b>Shaman Issues Recap</b></a><br>I'd like to get all of these shaman threads under one if we could. Personally, I'm having a hard time sorting out what the real issues are, because I'm seeing as many contradictions out there as the ones that are being attributed to me. <br><br>On one hand, someone makes a complaint about the damage that the weapon does, so I say that shaman don't do an appreciable amount of damage via melee. A bunch of threads started over this by shaman that melee all of the time. I clarified that though they may melee all of the time, they still do not do an appreciable amount of damage, so the damage/delay ratio of the weapon is inconsequential. More posts came back saying that they indeed to an appreicatable amount of damage in melee, even in the higher levels, so the damage should be upped. What do you feel is the case? <br><br>On another hand, some people complained about the effect (which is indeed a proc, in opposition with my original post which I corrected). These people said that it shouldn't be a proc because they don't melee, but it was some of the same people who were saying that they did an appreciable amount of melee above. If they are always meleeing, then there's no problem with a proc, yet if they never melee, there might be. Please let me know how you play. <br><br>I'm getting the impression that there are both people who melee all of the time (though I still don't think that they do an appreciable amount of damage via melee at higher levels) and those that never do. The ones who do so all of the time are fine with the proc, and want it to do more damage, while those who never melee are fine with the damage, and want the effect activatable. Would that be accurate? <br><br>Finally, there are the issues of the stats on the item, which I agree do not have the same percentage in primary stats as the cleric weapon. Of course, as I've posted, it's more a case of the cleric one being too good as opposed to the shaman one being not good enough. In any case, we're re-evaluating all of the items as a team tomorrow and will probably make some determinations there. <br><br>My personal feeling? I'd like to leave the damage ratio as-is, see some of the secondary stats moved to primary, see an increase in the mana granted, and I'd leave the effect as a proc. I would however consider changing the type of proc, as it overwrites itself every time it fires, making it a bad decision to continue meleeing following the original proc. While this is my personal feeling, and the one I will probably argue (unless someone corrects me severely here), I'm sure others will have their opinions as well. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022580.html"><b>Gordon's Job</b></a><br>Thanks for the note. I just mentioned in another thread that we all have our good and bad days. Being honest with you, I'm not exactly the best "pr" guy out there. I tend to speak my mind, both in the office and on the boards. Believe it or not I've had some of the people here as upset with me as some of the players have been in the past. <br><br>It's a bit of a delicate balance, and I may not be the best person to walk it, but I'll do the best I can while I can.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022579.html"><b>Gordon and Abashi</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Yeah, I'm a idiot, is Abashi the same person, I'm so confused it's stupid... I thought these were 2 people but Abashi signs his messages Gordon. Time to brace myself...]</i></font> <br><br>We're one in the same. "Abashi" is a pseudonym, where as Gordon is my actual name. <br><br>Don't worry though, you aren't the first one. I've actually received emails thanking me for my always kind and respectful demeanor, but suggesting that I do something about Abashi. <br><br>I guess we all have our good and bad days :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022573.html"><b>Bard issues</b></a><br>I just went through the list of broken stuff from the Concert hall, and most of it is things that are working as intended. It's also largely the same list I addressed here in the beginning of June, which was also mostly issues that were working as intended. Perhaps I'll post a quoted follow-up tomorrow. <br><br>The gist is, whatever their shortcomings (which all classes have), they remain one of the most desirable grouping classes, throughout their career. That is the most important aspect to consider.<br>--<br>For fairness, I should have mentioned that there were some bugs with items in that list that were corrected in the database this evening.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022578.html"><b>Hell Levels</b></a><br>It's explained fairly well in the FAQ (click the link below the post-new-topic button). <br><br>Here's the quick version: <br><br>On of the factors in determining the amount of experience is needed for any particular level is the level range modifier. The math works out so that the level in which the level-range modifier changes requires more experience than normal, were the experience curve linear. Perhaps we should have spread the additional requirement over the five levels of each range (for 30-50), however it's too late to change the experinece system at this juncture.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022525.html"><b>More Melee Issues for Shamans</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Plus if it procs more than once, as I wrote early, the damage is reset ]</i></font><br><br>This does in fact concern me, which is why we're going to discuss the issue further at the tuning meeting tomorrow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022572.html"><b>"Why must I duel a God?"</b></a><br>This is a known bug that we planned to have fixed at some point in the near future.

The latest <a href="http://www.avault.com/previews/preview_temp.asp?game=eqsov">preview of Velious</a> to grace the net comes to us from the folks at AVault.  Nothing new is learned from the preview, but it recaps the current information we know about the second expansion quite nicely.  Here's a clip:<UL>The land itself came into existence when a great dragon called Veeshan deposited her brood and blasted the continent with her breath, encasing it in eternal ice and surrounding it with terrible storms and geographical barriers made of ice. A third race that figures into the drama are the Coldain, Ice Dwarves that crashed on the continent and established a massive underground fortress in the mountains to elude detection. As the tale goes, a group of Gnomes that constructed a ship capable of busting through the ice barriers and enduring the terrible storms has unearthed a series of islands, finding on the largest an ancient and tremendous bridge that arcs toward the tip of Velious. For a price, the Gnomes will transport people to these uncharted lands. Enter the gamer, stage right.</UL>Thanks Anselmo!

Regarding the stat makeup, it's far more correct to say that the stats on the cleric item are too good, rather than the shaman one not being good enough. We'll speak more about possibly adjusting the stats of the shaman weapon, but if we decide to do it, stats will be moved around rather than increased.

In what could probably be called one the closing act of this drama, Mystere <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=7192109&replies=8">posted to our Brell Serilis Board</a> to let the community know about the phone chat he/she had with Verant CEO John Smedley:<UL><i>Greetings- <br><br>I have just gotten off the phone with John Smedley of Verant Interactive. He and I have spoken at length regarding the issues at hand here. I would like to add that there are many issues here that Verant is dealing with that even I was not aware of in the past. <br><br>While I will not go into the details of our discussion, I will say that we have come to an agreement regarding what has occurred in the past week. <br><br>To any who are getting their hopes up, I sadly will not be returning to EverQuest. While I harbor no ill will to any involved, I feel it is past time that I move on. I wish to thank everybody I have been associated with for their help, and their friendship (to those whose friendship I may have garnered). <br><br>To those who have been defending me so staunchly thus far: <br><br>Thank you, I can never express the amount of appreciation to each of you. You all fought the fight I could not, and for that I salute you all. I now ask that we take a deep breath, step back, and get back to that which we have enjoyed thus far. <br><br>Thank you. <br><br>P.S. Feel free to forward this to as many people as you can. <br><br>P.P.S. Also consider this a formal request by the author to stop posting the story without my permission. Thank you. <br><br>editor's note: I would like to add that Mr. Smedley personally apologized for the way this was handled. He also went so far as to tell me that Verant is currently developing policies to detail exactly what is and is not acceptable for fan fiction, and the acceptable consequences of breaking those policies. </i></UL><b>Quick Update:</b> As I was reading through the thread, I found one last post Mystere made in this thread that I think some of you may be interested in:<UL><i>To clarify: I was NOT paid off, I was NOT threatened in any way. We had an excellent conversation in which I basically got what I was looking for: a sincere apology and the promise that any future issues of this sort would not be handled in such a drastic manner. </I></UL>

John Smedley and Brad McQuaid made a few more comments <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021999.html">on the thread they started on the Gameplay Board</a>.  Here's the first bit from Smed:<UL><i>Next, yes.. we admit there was a quest in EQ that went a little far and we're taking out that part. It was a mistake and it's being fixed. <br><br>John Smedley</i></UL>Followed by Brad:<UL><i>I just wanted to quickly address the 14 seasons issue... I'm definitely not trying to stir up a new argument, or validate a tangent, but I did want people to understand how many people, even EQ players, could come to the conclusion that this person being raped was a child. <br><br>The following are the two sentences using this wording: <br><br>"The pitiful Teir&#8217;Dal girl, barely into her 14th season didn&#8217;t even try to resist. Xyth had bought her flesh 13 seasons ago, and long ago she had <br>learned the pain associated with even the appearance of resistance." <br><br>You do see her also refered to as a girl (also, later, a slave-girl). Now, whether the seasons are literal seasons, years, or EQ levels, I don't know for certain -- the evidence isn't conclusive, and you'd have to ask the author. But I do submit many people could and would interpret the subject as being a child. <br><br>-Aradune </i></UL>

Verant CEO John Smedley sent me a letter regarding the banning of Mystere at 12:04 AM this morning:<UL><i>I've seen the outcry regarding the banning of Mystere. While we typically do<br>not discuss this, I would like to elaborate on several things surrounding<br>this in order to address legitimate concerns raised by our playerbase.<br>It is very important for everyone concerned to understand that EverQuest's<br>reputation is a very important thing. In this day and age, video games are<br>subjected to an ENORMOUS amount of scrutiny by watchdog groups and the<br>federal and state governments.<br><br>In this case, a parent complained to a lot of anti-child porn watchdog sites<br>and several mainstream media outlets regarding the extremely graphic detail<br>of the story and the fact that it apparently contained violence directed at<br>a child. <br><br>For us, this poses an extremely serious problem. EverQuest has a reputation<br>as being a family oriented game. Yes it has a mature rating, and yes it does<br>contain violence. That in and of itself gives pause to many people out there<br>(especially parents). But, you would be amazed at how many parents play this<br>game with their kids mostly because we do control the language and they feel<br>like EQ is a family friendly environment despite the dark overtones of some<br>of the stories and quests.<br><br>You may say "a person has the right to say whatever they want"... and of<br>course that's true. But, when that action is linked to a company's<br>Intellectual Property (which is just a fancy way of saying people associate<br>it with EQ) it becomes our business because it threatens our business by<br>making us a huge target for all the folks out there that think we all are<br>all a bunch of violent video game players. This just gives them fuel for the<br>fire.<br><br>For us, this story represented a serious problem because it used EverQuest<br>as a backdrop. It's already been pointed out by our General Counsel in more<br>legal terms, but the simple fact is that it's easy for folks to point at<br>that story, point at EQ and link the two. <br><br>Whether or not any of us likes that or not isn't really the question. The<br>fact is that EverQuest is the very heart of our business and we have to take<br>that very seriously.<br><br>Now - Will we be policing the Internet looking for these kinds of stories? <br><br>No. We won't. In fact, none of us was even aware of this until it was<br>brought to our attention. That doesn't mean if someone crosses the line<br>again and it's pointed out we won't do the same thing.<br><br>The big question is - where's the line? And what right do we have to draw it<br>outside the game?<br><br>The answer is complicated and extremely subjective, so I'll just have to be<br>honest and say we'll know it when it's over the line. We're going to discuss<br>it in the upcoming few weeks and see if we can make it more clear, but I<br>can't honestly say if we'll get anywhere because none of us wants to stop<br>people from writing awesome fan-fiction about EQ.<br><br>But we aren't going to be looking at every fan site and becoming the Thought<br>Police. We have neither the time, nor the inclination to do that. However we<br>need to protect EverQuest's good image as best we can.<br><br>Did we handle this as well as we could have?<br><br>No - We didn't. And for that, I apologize.<br><br>In the future, we're going to handle this in a different way.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL>Thank you for the letter, John!

Here's the Saturday edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href=""><b>Issues Addressed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: With this upping the ante on machine requirements, how do you get away with something like this by changing the minimum specifications listed on the box when one purchased this game?]</i></font> <br><br>It's not a change from the minimum system requirements. The original box required a D3D compliant video card. The definition of D3D compliant is what is changing per new drivers released by Microsoft. <br><br>These changes are necessary to remain competitive and provide EQ gamers what they expect: a game that is constantly being updated. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will Verant refund people who bought the game based on what the box said only to find their game inoperable a year later? ]</i></font><br><br>I doubt that there will be many, if any people who are incapable of running EverQuest once the changes are made. Regarding what will be done in those cases should they exist, our legal department is still working out what our policy will be. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: These kinds of changes are done in releases of new products, I've never heard of a title in the past with this situation ]</i></font><br><br>EverQuest is in a unique situation as a constantly updated product that bridges technology generations. I think that its reasonable that gamers would expect that the product would keep pace with current technology. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) In game chat channels, kind of like shouts, but with a channel like a CB channel ]</i></font><br><br>We've addressed your suggestion here before, when it was made by others. The technology requirements to support an infinite number of separate chat channels would be quite extensive. It's not likely a change that will be implemented. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Why has Povar never been split? Is there a technical reason behind this? It is one of the older servers, it is always very crowded and not once has it had a split. There are not many of the older servers that can claim this now, and I'm very curious why the Povar server appears to have been continually overlooked. ]</i></font><br><br>There are other servers as old (and older I believe) than Povar. Simply, it's not been one of the most populated servers at the time we were sampling server populations when making the decision as to which servers will be split. I understand that everyone wants to see their server get split, and every time we do one we see posts from people on the servers that weren't chosen wanting to know why we didn't choose to split theirs. It's simply a matter of numbers. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Why can't players heal people who are linkdead yet people who are linkdead can still be harmed by npcs? You are concerned about people pulling the plug, but why not consider the zone they're in? ]</i></font><br><br>It's part technology and part philosophy. The technology side is that players who are linkdead are essentially NPCs, with a lot of case-specific coding to handle things such as offensive spells and other things. Beneficial spells do not directly translate through that process. The philosophy side of it is that we never want going linkdead to be a preferable situation. NPCs already react differently to linkdead PCs than they do played ones, reducing the danger somewhat. Reducing the danger further would upset that balance and create an undesirable situation.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021745.html"><b>Q&A</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Will the mobs in the game be adjusted now that haste has been 'fixed' and players now deal out less damage that what the mobs were designed to take? ]</i></font><br><br>No, they continue to be appropriate. I guess you are probably wondering how that can be the case :)  You see, mid level encounters were not typically tested with a haste item and a haste spell, but one or the other, since mid-level groups are more free-form in their makeup than the high level ones. <br><br>The high level groups were typically tested with max-haste, in the form of an item plus a spell. Now we didn't know at the time that any item plus any spell yielded max, but testing with max was still our intent. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) While we're on haste, can you please try to look into, and explain why the Swirle Spine Belt, which is considerable harder to get than the FBSS, has less haste than the FBSS?(and you wounder why kedge is always so empty...) ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not sure that it is less haste. The players determined all of the haste numbers by analyzing data in the log. That process has more than a few problem, as I've yet to see a list of haste items and percentages posted by a player that was correct. Not even the lineup of the items has been correct. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:3) Was the "toning down" of high speed 2 hander weapons intended to also hurt the Swiftblade, or mainly the moss covered branch? maybe drop the delay at which the damage bonus was weakened to under the swiftblade dly if this wasn't the intent? (no, I don't have a ranger, but do have some ranger friends ]</i></font><br><br>It was intended to catch any weapon below a specific speed (28), so if the Swiftblade is in that range, then yes. Keep in mind however that the adjustment was rather small, yielding only a couple points of damage per hit. We probably could have gotten away without annoucning it, but it was on the list of types of changes that I've told everyone that I would announce. I do fear that the announcement of it however has made it a bigger issue than it needed to be. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5) Are mobs that attack people who AREN'T kos to Venril Sathir, yet are obvously his minions considered bugged.. or ever planned to be 'fixed'.. ? ]</i></font><br><br>They aren't 'broken'. The dungeons are designed so that they won't be completely safe, even for people who are in his good graces. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6) Will the reasoning behind the Venril Sathir story line ever be totally explained? ]</i></font><br><br>There is a pretty good amount of the story revealed in game for those willing to search for it. As for the unrevealed portions, I'd say that this is a good possibility. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7) Is\Will\Do you feel there should be alternate ways for non Kunark owners to obtain their particle weapon?]</i></font> <br><br>The Epic quest weapons are designed to be Level 60 weapons.

That aspect means nothing if people are able to gain a competitive advantage through means not available to other players. <br><br>Single player games contain cheats because it is truly only the players business in that case. Massively multiplayer games have to get everyone playing by the same set of rules for them to be successful. <br><br>If cheating were truly only the business of the person cheating, people wouldn't get worried about things such as dupe bugs, ebayers, showeq users, or perceived favoritism from the GM staff.

It was <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2637913,00.html">reported last night that GameSpot</a> will be interviewing Verant Interactive regarding the "Mystere" banning incident.  Look for this upcoming interview Monday on their site.  Here's a clip from the report:<UL>n an official statement, a legal counsel to Sony Online stated that the issue is "about infringement of our intellectual property rights in a patently offensive manner that tarnishes the Sony, Verant, and EverQuest brands." The fan fiction is said to violate copyrights for the game, and Verant acted on this to initiate its banning procedure, which is used in cases of in-game cheating and misconduct. This is the first case where a fan-written story has drawn such a response from Verant, which reacted to the mature content of the story, describing the rape and subsequent escape of a young dark elf. Verant's actions have drawn an outcry from the EverQuest community, who charge that this is an excessive form of censorship, although Verant says this is not a First Amendment issue. <br><br>We have discussed the controversy with Verant and Sony Online, and Monday we will post an interview with the EverQuest team on the subject. </UL>

Were people able to kill nonstop with maximum efficiency, I would imagine that EQ would not have the following that it does today. <br><br>Socialization, making friends, and working together towards a common goal are very important to EverQuest. It however only occurs because we "force" it to occur via game design.

Safka brings the following news:<BLOCKQUOTE>Safka's Lore<br><br>Hail all I bring possibly sad tidings,<br><br>Given the recent developments as regards fan fiction, we are temporarily <br>closing our doors. The reason? well Verant have banned a person for <br>'unacceptable' fan fiction and infringement of copyrigth. We support their <br>decision fully, and agree the story was unacceptable content for what could <br>be an audience containing minors.<br><br>However until such time as Verant see fit to publish guidelines as to what <br>is 'acceptable' fan fiction none of us wish to run the risk of banishment <br>from our beloved Norrath.<br><br>We apologise sincerely to all our fans who have followed the saga for six <br>months and over forty episodes, we will hopefuly return. However <br>'acceptable' and 'offensive' are subjective terms, if and when Verant see <br>fit to define them we shall return.<br><br>Until then I am afraid 'tis last orders at our Inn . .<br><br>Drink up gentlemen and ladies . . .<br><br>Safka Fairheart<br><a href="http://www.eqlore.moonfruit.com">http://www.eqlore.moonfruit.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Sorry to hear it. :(
