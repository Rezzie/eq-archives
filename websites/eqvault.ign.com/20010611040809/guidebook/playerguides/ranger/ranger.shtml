Rangers are one of the most fun classes to play in EverQuest.  Or so I've been told; I started my first character as a Ranger, and I've never felt bored enough with being a Ranger to play any other class past level 3.  My Ranger is currently level 40.  I have written this guide in a roughly chronological order, starting with the things you need to know right off the bat, and introducing topics as they become relevant.  This guide is intended to teach you a little bit about everything, especially for those people who are new to the world of Norrath.  If you're an experienced Ranger, most of these things will be pretty obvious.  If you've played another class, most of these things will be pretty obvious.  But if you're entirely new to the game, hopefully this will help.

<P>
A Quick Overview<P>
Rangers are a hybrid class, a mix of the Warrior and Druid classes.  Make no mistake though, we are fighters first, casters second.  A distant second.  Most of your spellcasting will be done before and after combat, with only a few spells being cast during the fighting.  Rangers cannot wear platemail, you will be limited to chainmail/banded armor.

<P>
Character Creation<P>
You can choose from three races if you want to be a Ranger: Humans, Half-Elves, and Wood Elves.  Before I begin, I want to stress that any of these three races can make an excellent Ranger.  Pick whichever race you want to play, especially if you have a role-playing concept in mind for your character.  Don't pick your race based on which you think will give you a statistical advantage.  Pick the one you'll have fun with.
<P>
Statistics<P>
Which race you pick will determine your starting statistics, but you get 20 extra points to distribute as you see fit.  So we better talk about stats first.  The primary stats for Rangers are Strength, Agility, and Dexterity.  Don't believe whatever the character generation screen tells you, listen to me.  Strength determines your carrying capacity.  Since the armor you wear is counted against your carrying capacity, you'll need high Strength if you plan on wearing armor and still being able to carry some loot back to town after your exploits abroad.  Strength also has a very small affect on your damage output.  As counter-intuitive as this may seem, it's true.  Don't expect your damage output to skyrocket if you load up on equipment that enhances your Strength.  Agility affects your armor class, or AC.  The effect is small.  Very small.  But it's there.  Barely.  Agility is nice, but it's not all that important.  I only included it because everyone else in the world will tell you how important it is.  Dexterity affects two important effects for Rangers: how much damage you can do with your bow (You get a bow!), and how often your weapons will "proc."  Some weapons have spells imbued in them that have a small chance of going off, or "proc'ing", every time you hit with them.  High Dexterity makes this more likely to happen.  Proc is generally known as shorthand for "process", but some people think it's an abbreviation for something else.  No one really knows or cares, just say proc and everyone will know what you mean.  The other stats can be important, but not as important as these three.  Stamina has an affect on your number of hitpoints.  The affect is small, almost negligible at high levels.  Wisdom determines the amount of mana that you will have.  Sounds pretty important, why didn't I list it as a primary stat?  A few reasons.  First, we don't cast very often in combat.  We mostly cast between fights, to heal and prepare for the next fight.  How much mana you have isn't all that important when your routine is meditate, cast, repeat.  Save enough mana to cast a few times in combat, and you'll be fine.  Secondly, since we're hybrids, we see less return for our extra Wis, as compared to our Druid brethren.  Intelligence will affect how quickly you can learn a trade skill, which probably means Fletching if you're a Ranger.  Not important enough to spend any of your precious points on.  Charisma affects how much vendors will pay you for things you sell them, and how much they charge you for their items.  Also not important enough to spend points on.
<P>
Human<P>
A Human Ranger has base statistics of Strength: 80, Stamina: 85, Agility: 85, Dexterity: 75, Wisdom: 80, Intelligence: 75, and Charisma: 75.  As you can see, Humans are pretty well balanced.  You might want to bump the Str up to 90 and then put the other points in Agi or Dex, or you could go all out on Str and get it to 100.  Humans have the bothersome disadvantage of not having enhanced vision, which means you're not going to be able to see in the dark like Half-Elves and Wood Elves can.  Take heart though, we do get the spell Eyes of the Cat at level 30, which grants Infravision.  Humans also have the advantage over the other races in that they level more quickly (or should I say less slowly).  The other races pay an experience penalty for their advantages.  Humans Rangers are definitely the most rare of the three choices available, but there's no good reason why. <P>

Half-Elf<P>
A Half-Elf Ranger has base Strength: 75, Stamina: 80, Agility: 100, Dexterity: 85, Wisdom: 65, Intelligence: 75, and Charisma: 75.  The most striking thing about Half-Elf Rangers is their low Wis score.  Now, I know I told you that Wis wasn't a primary stat for Rangers.  And I was telling the truth.  But there's something I didn't tell you: your spells have a greater chance of fizzling if your Wis is low.  Especially if it's below 75, which is the benchmark.  Fizzles mean wasted mana, so you don't want that to happen too often.  So for a Half-Elf Ranger, I would recommend getting the Wis up to 75, and the Str up to 85.  
<P>
Wood-Elf<P>
A Wood-Elf Ranger has base Strength: 70, Stamina: 75, Agility: 105, Dexterity: 80, Wisdom: 80, Intelligence: 75, Charisma: 75.  You guessed it, beef up on Str.  A little extra Sta might be tempting, but get your Str to at least 85.  Wood Elves are the most popular race choice for Rangers.  Again, there's no good reason why, considering that all the skills that Wood Elves get as racial abilities, Rangers get sooner or later.  So you're paying that experience penalty just becase you're impatient.  Wood Elves do have a slight advantage though, in that they can wear both small and medium sized armor.  Humans and Half-Elves must wear medium.
<P>
Don't forget to pick a name while you're at it.
<P>
Deity Selection<P>
Depending on your race, you can worship Tunare, the Mother or All, or Karana, the Rainkeeper.  From a gameplay standpoint, it doesn't make much difference.  Pick whichever one you would rather roleplay.  Just keep in mind that no matter which one you choose, evil NPC's aren't going to like you very much, so be careful.  Also, players in EQ generally don't like it when it rains.  It limits visibility.  So if you roleplay, be prepared to take some flak from your fellow players if you really, really like it when it rains.  It's all in good fun though.
<P>
Starting City<P>
Now you get to pick your home town.  Humans start in Surefall Glade, just outside Qeynos.  Wood Elves start in Kelhetin, in the forest of Greater Faydark.  Half-Elves can start in either town.  For the inexperienced player, I would recommnd starting in the Surefall Glade / Qeynos area, if you can.  Kelethin is EQ's bustling metropolis.  Greater Faydark is always crammed with people, and your text window will never stop scrolling as people try to buy and sell things and generally have idiotic conversations.  In contrast, you can at least get a little peace and quiet in Qeynos Hills, while still having other players in the zone who can answer any question you might have if you need help.  Also, I don't know if things are any better in Qeynos Hills, but the guards in Greater Faydark are morons.  It takes them far too long to figure out that they should probably do something about that orc pawn who's beating you to death.  On top of all that, Kelethin is a tree city.  It's a bunch of platforms built onto tree trunks.  You ride big lifts to get up to the city.  There are all sorts of ramps and bridges between platforms.  So the city's layout is confusing, and you always have to be very, very careful not to fall.  Falling hurts.  Pretty much every newbie who starts in Kelethin falls to their death at least once.  I know I did.  The Qeynos area is much more straightforward.
<P>

Getting Started<P>

Okay, so you're finally ready to get started.  Open up your inventory, equip your newbie sword, find your guild leader, turn in your guild note, and get your starting tunic.  You also have five training points to spend in your guild.  You should probably spend them on 1 Hand Slashing, so you'll have a leg-up in early battles.  You get five points to spend every level.  You should save these points so that when you get a new skill, you can dump those saved up training points into it, so that it doesn't start out pitifully low.  You'll also have some food and water.  These will automatically be eaten.  You also have a Tome of Discord.  If you wanted to become pvp, you would give this to the Priest of Discord (PoD).  You don't want to do that.  Destroy that book immediately.  You'll also need to set up some hotkeys.  You have six banks of hotkeys in the lower righthand corner.  Setting up these hotkeys is extremely important.  I could probably write a whole seperate guide on hotkeys.  But for now, just do your best with it.  Hotkeys are easy to learn, tough to master.
<P>
There is one thing that you must do as soon as possible.  Go to the options menu and reconfigure your keyboard.  I don't care what else you change, but you must change the auto-attack key.  By default, it is set to "a".  The problem with this is when you try to talk to an NPC, but you accidently forget to hit the "Enter" key first.  So instead of saying "What pixie tricksters?", or whatever you're trying to say, you get as far as typing Wha.  When you hit that "a" key, you've turned on auto-attack.  And the NPC is going to fight back, and you're going to lose.  I learned this lesson when the Kelethin town drunkard beat me into submission, when I was just trying to talk to him.  More embarrassingly, this was right after someone had led me to him so I could talk to him.  I burned with newbie shame as the person watched the drunkard pummel me.  Don't let this happen to you.  Remap auto-attack to something you would never type by accident, like "=".  Once you get good with the hotkeys, you'll probably just want to hotkey the "Melee Attack" button, which will do the same thing as hitting the auto-attack button.  But for now, just remapping it to "=" should do fine.

<P>
Levels 1-5: Hard Lessons Made Easy
<P>
This is where you earn your degree in rat slaying.  Kill rats.  Kill decaying skeletons.  Kill gnoll pups.  Kill orc pawns.  Kill wasp drones.  Just be sure that you /con everything.  This is done by targeting the creature you want to kill and hitting "c."  You will get a message showing the monster's relative power.  You can probably kill anything that cons even or blue.  Killing green creature gives you little to no experience, don't bother.  Killing yellow and red mobs is difficult, be sure you know where the guards are if you attempt this.  Killing things is easy, just target it, and then walk up and hit the auto-attack button.  (You remembered to change the auto-attack button, right?!)  Combat ensues, and hopefully you kill the creature.  Then loot the body by right-clicking on the corpse.  Be careful of hunting monsters that will help each other out.  Some monsters will attack you if they see you attacking their friends.  Some monsters don't care.  Some will just plain attack you.  Know which ones are which.  After a fight, go back to the guard area and sit down to recover your hitpoints.  Then go do it again.
<P>
If you die, and you probably will, you will respawn at your bind point.  Bind Affinity is a spell that pure casters get, which binds a person to wherever they are standing.  If you go traveling, be sure to get a bind in the nearest cities.  We non-pure-casters can only be bound in cities.  If you die while you are levels 1-4, you will have a brand new newbie sword and more food and water just waiting for you in your inventory.  You body remains where you died, go find it and recover any armor or coins you might have had.  If you die at level 5 or later, you respawn with nothing.  Recovering your corpse is essential.  Also, if you die while you are levels 1-5, your body will only stick around for haf an hour.  Then it goes poof, and you lose everything that was on it.  This is a Bad Thing (tm).  Don't let this happen.  Don't wander too far from your bind point until you are level 6.  After that, your body will last 24 hours if you are in-game, or one week if you log out in frustration.
<P>
A note on corpse recovery: there is a very important command in EQ called /corpse.  Typing /corpse in the chat window will cause your corpse to come to you, if you are with 50 feet of your corpse.  /corpse is something you want to hotkey, so you don't have to keep typing it.  Quite often, it's a bad idea to try to loot your corpse where you died.  You probably died there for a reason.  So instead, use the /corpse command repeatedly while running to "drag" your corpse somewhere safe, and then loot it there.
<P>
Acquiring armor is important.  This requires money.  Allow me to share with you the most important money-making scheme for newbies: bone chips.  When you kill skeletons, they drop bone chips.  Collect bone chips.  Lots of them.  Do not sell them to vendors.  Other players will pay anywhere from 1 to 5 platinum pieces for every 20 bonechips.  Necromancers need bonechips to summon their pets.  Everyone else needs bone chips, usually to do quests raise their faction standing with certain NPC's.    No one wants to run around killing skeletons all day, so they just buy the bone chips from newbies like you.  If you're a roleplayer, you probably won't want to sell bone chips to Necromancers.  I don't blame you.  In fact, I encourage you.  Lots of non-Necros will be around to buy the bone chips though, so don't 
miss out on this exciting business opportunity.  Don't try to haggle though.  If there's someone offering 2 plat for twenty bonechips, don't try to extort them to pay 4.  Just take the 2 plat and smile.
<P>
Now that you've got a little money, I would recommend that you find the nearest NPC who sells leather armor and buy some.  Just make sure to inspect it to make sure that it's the right size for you before you buy it.  Don't buy any armor better than leather before level 6.  It's too likely to decay if you lose your corpse.  Save your money to buy a new sword, too.  Try to find another player selling a Minotaur Axe, or a Fine Steel Longsword, or a Dwarven Axe.  These are all great weapons for your early days, and will serve you well.  Mino Axes go for 4pp, FS Long Swords for about 8pp, and Dwarven Axes for maybe 10pp.  Yeah, it sounds like a lot, but it'll be well worth it.  You may even get lucky and find someone who will take pity on you, with your patchwork armor and newbie sword, and just give you one of those fine weapons.  Thank these people profusely, but don't expect this to happen.
<P>
This leads us to an important aspect of newbiehood.  You're going to see a lot of people running around with very cool looking armor and weapons.  You're going to be curious.  Feel free to ask someone about those cool claws or neat staff they've got, but be polite.  Be polite, and for the love of god, be grammatically correct.  If you come off like a moron, the person will just ignore you.  If you are polite and unobtrusive, the person will probably be nice and talk to you and give you advice.  Listen carefully to any advice they have to give you, they've got all that cool stuff for a reason.  You may also be very tempted to ask if the person has any weapons or armor they don't need, and if they would give them to you.  Do not do this.  EverQuest is already overrun with beggars.  Beggars are horrible people.  No one likes them.  Do not become a beggar.  If you read this entire guide and only remember one thing, don't be a beggar.
<P>
On a related note, you may find yourself fighting alongside someone who is the same level as you, but has MUCH better equipment.  That person is called a "twink".  Twinks are characters played by a a player who already has another, high level character.  They use that character to collect good equipment, and give it to their twink to help them level faster.  You may resent twinks, but whatever you do, don't fall into despair and resort to becoming a beggar so that you can become like them.  If you are grouped with a twink, just stand behind them and let them take all the hits.  They're better equipped to do so, obviously.  So just use it to your own advantage.  Be aware, however, that equipment isn't everything, especially at low levels.  Just because they've got full platemail and an Uber-Sword of Smiting, doesn't mean that they can't get taken down in short order by four or five orcs.
<P>
There are a few other things you should be doing during these levels.  One of them is building your skills, like Sense Heading and Taunt.  Sense Heading tells you what direction you are facing.  At low skill levels, this skill almost never works.  Just keep hitting the Sense Heading button though, and eventually it will get better.  It's a pain to build up this skill, but it's really quite important that you know which way you're going later.
<P>
Taunt is a skill that mystifies many newbies, so allow me to explain.  When you taunt a monster, it makes the monster want to attack you more.  This skill is crucial at higher levels, when you will be fighting in groups.  It is a Bad Thing if the monster is beating the crap out of the group's Wizard or Cleric.  You're a fighter, it's your job to get hit.  So it will be your job to Taunt the monster off of the non-fighters, so that it will attack you while the casters do their casting.  You shouldn't really be fighting in groups before level 6 or so, you'll do just fine on your own.  But when you start grouping later, you'll need to have your Taunt skill up to snuff.  So even when you're not grouped, just keep hitting Taunt so that your skill will go up.
<P>
Tracking is also another skill you'll want to practice, and practice a lot.  Using Tracking, you can locate and kill specific monsters.  Once you pick a specific monster to track down, you will be given constant information on which level the monster is, relative to you.  As your skill improves, your tracking radius increases.  If you are not moving while tracking, the monsters that spawned most recently will be at the top of the list.  The problem with tracking is that at high levels, it gives you too much information.  I can walk into the Oasis of Marr and hit Track, and I end up looking at a long list of snakes while a sand giant sneaks up behind me.  Additionally, if you are grouped, your group members will always be at the top of the list.  But if you try to track your group members, you will end up going in the completely wrong direction.  This is a bug.  Verant has said that they are looking into ways to enhance Tracking for Rangers, we'll see what develops. <P>

Archery is a good skill to have a lower levels.  Buy a rough hickory bow from another player who knows how to fletch, or you can try to make one yourself.  Fletching is a good skill to learn, so that you can make your own arrows.  Player-made bows and arrows are superior to the ones you can buy off of vendors.  If you want to get really good at fletching, there are a number of fletching guides to be found.  Read one, and grow wise.  Once you've got your bow, put it to good use.  It's a great way to soften up your enemy, by shooting an arrow at them while they're a distace away.  Then they come running right at you, and you kill them the old fashioned way.
<P>
At level 3 you get the Forage skill.  Go back to the guild hall and train in it.  Make a hotkey for it, and then hit it every time it pops up.  Foraging lets you pull food and water out of thin air.  At lower levels you probably won't be good enough to keep up with your food and water needs with the forage skill alone.  That's fine, just buy it from vendors when you have to.  But keep practicing, and once you get good, you'll never have to waste money on food and water again.  In fact, I usually have more of it then I know what to do with, and just offer it to the people I group with.  But that won't happen until much later.
<P>
At level 5 you get Kick.  Go back to the guild hall and train in it.  (See a pattern here?)  Kick lets you get in an extra attack.  You have to make a hotkey for it though, and hit it manually every time it pops up during combat.  Kick is good.  Get it as soon as you hit 5.
<P>
That's about everything you need to know to survive as a newbie.  But what about life beyond?
<P>

Levels 6-12: Expanding Horizons
<P>
Once you hit 6, you start to get some freedom.  Namely, freedom from the fear of losing your body if you die.  You'll probably want to start grouping more regularly once you get to this point, but you certaintly don't have to.  Get out and about, explore a little.  Make friends.
<P>
Also, try to buy some banded armor.  Players who are skilled in Blacksmithing can make banded armor, which is better than leather or chainmail.  Banded pieces usually sells for about 1pp per point of AC, if I remember correctly.
<P>
At level 8 you get Dodge.  Just train one point in dodge.  Dodge works automatically in combat.  Every time a monster tries to hit you, there is a chance you will dodge.  The skill will go up quickly on its own, after you train in it.  Besides, you want to save your guild training points, because...
<P>
At level 9, you get to start casting spells.  Go to your guild hall and buy your spells.  Scribe them into your spellbook by selecting the spell scroll and clicking on an open spell space in the book.  Then memorize them by clicking on the spell in the spellbook and clicking on one of the 8 spell slots in the upper lefthand of your screen.  Put some traing points into the 6 spell skills: Alteration, Abjuration, Evocation, Divination, Conjuration, and Channeling.  Be sure that every skill gets at least one point.  Channeling is the skill that determines whether or not you can recover from an interrupted spell casting, and the other five skills are used by the different spells.  Now you have spells, but the problem is that all these spell casting skills are way behind.  The only way to raise these skills is to cast the corresponding spells, though Channeling can be raised by casting any of the spells.  Just keep casting these spells.  As a rule, you should never have full mana (the blue bar in the upper right hand).  Keep practicing, you're going to need those skills.  Some of the more important spells you get at level 9: <P>

Flame Lick does a small amount of Damage over Time (DoT), and it lowers the target's AC by a bit.  It's good, but it's not awesome.  Use it at the beginning of a fight.
Minor Heal restores 10 hitpoints.  You'll be casting this one a lot in-between fights.  It's great for reducing downtime. <P>
Skin Like Wood adds a small amount to your maximum hitpoints and AC.  You should always have this on, and if you're grouped, cast it on the other people in the group. <P>
Snare.  There are just too many good things to say about Snare.  When you cast Snare on a target, it reduces the target's running speed by about half.  The implications are astounding.  Is that monster a little too strong for you to kill?  Snare it and then run backwards shooting arrows at it, then finish it off with melee when it's weakened.  Is a monster badly wounded and trying to run away?  Snare it, and they're immobilized while you finish the job.  Are you getting beaten up and you need to run to the guards?  Snare the monster before you try to run.  It won't be able to keep up, you'll get away scott-free.  Or you can just put some distance between you and the mob, heal yourself, and try again.  Snare is also a powerful taunt, so if the monster is beating up someone else in your group pretty badly, cast Snare on them right before you taunt them.  It's almost guaranteed to get their attention.  Snare lasts a good long while, too.  Snare is awesome.  Snare is your friend. <P>

Remember, now and for the course of your career as a Ranger, every spell you've got, a Druid has had longer.  The Druid probably has an even better version of the spell.  If you're grouped with a Druid, always talk to them to determine which spells each of you is casting, so that you don't waste mana.
<P>
Be aware that you can hotkey those 8 spell slots.  Do so.  It's much better then manually clicking on the spell slots with the mouse.  Your spellbook must be open to hotkey spells, to save you some confusion.
<P>
At level 10 you get Sneak.  Sneak is only rarely useful, but it doesn't hurt.  When you activate it, your movement speed if reduced.  If you sneak successfully, you can get much closer to monsters before they notice you.  It's not a bad idea to keep this skill maxed, but you won't use it very often. <P>

At level 12 you get Meditate.  To meditate, you open up your spellbook and hit the meditate button, and you recover your mana much more quickly.  The downside is they you don't really know what's going on around you, so find a safe place to meditate.  If you still haven't worked those casting spells up to snuff like I told you to, get it done now.
<P>

Levels 13-20: Coming Into Your Own. <P>

By now, you should be grouping pretty regularly, and probably have a group of friends you fight with often.  This is good, this is what EQ is really all about.
<P>
You're going to need to look into getting some magical weapons about this time.  Certain monsters, such as ghouls and willowisps, are magical, and can't be hit with normal weapons.  The Barbed Leather Whip, Polished Granite Tomahawk, Dargoon Dirk, and Silvery War Axe are all worth looking into at this level range.  If you can get some friends to help you, you can try to do the Short Sword of Morin quest as well.  You'll also need to get some magic boots in order to kick magical monster successfully; Kobold-hide Boots get my seal of approval.
<P>
You may also be thinking about buying some jewelry from other players.  This includes things like necklaces, rings, and bracelets to boost your various stats.  Let me tell you though, don't succumb to this temptation.  Stats are, for the most part, broken.  Well, they're not really broken, it's just that their effect is almost non-existent.  Try to find things to wear that boost your AC as much as possible, this is much more important than being able to brag about how high your stats are.  The only possible exception would be Dex, which you might want to boost if you're using a weapon that procs.  Even then though, don't sacrifice too much of your AC.  AC is your most important stat.
<P>
You get some new spells at 15.  Most of them are pretty useful, especially:
<P>
Burst of Fire, a Direct Damage (DD) spell, good for 15 points of damage.
Camouflage is a lifesaver.  It's an invisibility spell, but beware that it only works outdoors, and it doesn't work against the undead.  Camouflage can make corpse recovery much easier, and it's great for passing through dangerous areas when you don't want to get caught up in combat.  But be careful, this spell's duration is random.  It can last ten minutes, it can last ten seconds.  You'll get a text message right before it wears off, so stay on your toes.  Your invisibility will break if you are attacked, cast another spell, turn on auto-attack, fire your bow, or loot a body.  Some monsters can see through invisibility.  If you are invisible and you con a monster, and it is still ready to attack you, then you know that it can see you.  If it can't, it will con indifferent.  You can zone and still be invisible when you come out on the other side, so you may want to do this if you don't know what's waiting for you on the other side.  If you go into an underground zone with Camouflage on, you will still be invisible, but you won't be able to recast it when it wears off.
Dance of the Fireflies summons a globe of fireflies, a light source.  This is a good spell for Human Rangers.  Even if you've got Infravision though, I would encourage you to use this spell, because it also has the side effect of making you that much more visible.  If you're pulling monsters for your group, they need to be able to see you coming.  It's also nice because it's the first spell you get that uses the Conjuration skill.  Practice this skill every once in awhile, you'll need to get Conjuration up to snuff when you get another Conjuration spell later. <P>
Feet Like Cat is an Agility buff.  It raises the target's Agi by 18 points.  Always have it on yourself, and cast it on your groupmates, too. <P>
Invoke Lightning is an Area of Effect (AoE) spell.  All monsters around the target will suffer up to 25 points of damage.  The effect radius is small though, and it can only be cast outdoors.  Be wary, it's possible to hurt yourself with this spell. <P>
Thistlecoat is a self-only buff that adds to your AC, and it also makes monsters take one point of damage every time they hit you.  Not a whole lot, but it can add up.  This is anther spell that you should always have on. <P>
You also get the Grasping Roots spell at this level.  Grasping Roots is not as good as Snare.  It will not last as long, and is not as reliable.  Do not use Grasping Roots in Snare's place.
<P>
At level 17 you get Dual Wield, probably a skill you've been wanting for some time now.  This lets you use another weapon in your offhand, instead of a shield.  Obviously, both weapons need to be one-handed.  You won't swing the weapon in your off-hand very often until this skill gets up, but be patient.
<P>
Speaking of weapons, this is a good time to bring up one-handers vs. two-handers.  At lower levels, you may be tempted to use a two-handed weapon instead of a shield and a one-hander.  You may even be tempted to continue doing so after you get Dual Wield.  That's fine if you want to, but let me warn you: There are no good two-handed weapons for Rangers at high levels.  There are lots of great one-handers, but all of the really good two-handers can't be equipped by Rangers.  So use a two-hander if you want to at lower levels, but be sure to have some one-handed weapons that you can use to keep your 1H Slashing and Dual Wield skills maxed out.  You're going to need them later.  Any Ranger with a two-hander is gonna get funny looks, no matter what level they are.
<P>
At level 18 you get the Parry skill.  It works just like Dodge, just put one point into it and it will automatically go off and improve in skill during combat.
<P>
At level 20 you get Double Attack.  This is another highly important skill.  With Double Attack, there is a chance you will hit twice when you swing your weapon.  So, yes, with Dual Wield, there is a chance you will hit the monster four times in one round.  Don't expect it to happen very often though, until your skills reach higher levels.
<P>
You also get to pick a last name at level 20.  Congratulations, you've earned it.  Just type /surname [insert last name here].  Without the brackets, genius.  Once it's approved, it'll appear right over your head, right after your first name, kinda like you'd expect.
<P>
Beyond level 20
<P>
Things start to slow down at this point.  You've got most of your skills now, though you've still got some more cool spells to look forward to.  
<P>
If you're still in banded armor at this point, you're no doubt feeling the pain of not being able to wear plate.  Not to worry though, there's a line of Ranger-only quest armor, called Ivy Etched.  The quests originate in the Ranger guild in the Kithicor forest.  Kithicor is a very dangerous place at night, when all sorts of very high level undead cretures walk the woods.  Wait until morning, when these monsters despawn, before attempting to reach the guild.  The guild itself is just southeast of Rivervale, the easiest way to find it is to Track the guild leader Morin Shadowbane.  I highly recommend that you buy or quest for as much of the Ivy armor as soon as you can.  You need that extra AC.  It's also worth pointing out that you can come here to train in new skills instead of running all the way to Surefall Glade or Kelethin.  I don't believe they sell spells here though.
<P>
Here's the cream of the crop of the level 22 spells:
<P>
Enduring Breath lets you breathe underwater.  It takes one fish scale to cast Enduring Breath.  You can get fish scales by fishing, or you can buy them from a few vendors.  Probably the most convenient vendor who sells these is the Erudite woman in the inns on the west side of the East Commons zone. <P>
Harmony is a great spell, but it takes a little getting used to.  It's an AoE lull spell, outdoors only.  Let's say there's a group of bandits that you want to kill, but you can't kill them all at the same time.  Cast Harmony on the bandit in the middle of the group.  This will Harmonize all the bandits around it.  Then you can pull one of the bandits from the group, and the other bandits won't attack.  Just be sure to pull the bandit far enough away that you won't be within agro-range when Harmony wears off on the others.  Harmony can also be resisted, but you won't know if it was or not until you try to pull.  So be ready to deal with it if you try to pull one bandit, and one or two of the others resisted the spell and they come after you.  This doesn't happen very often though, Harmony is pretty reliable. <P>
Ignite is another DD spell, does up to 37 damage.  Pretty straightforward.  A note on DD spells in general for Rangers: You generally don't want to chain-cast them throughout combat at higher levels.  This is because in the time it takes you to cast the spell, you probably could have inflicted more damage just by melee'ing.  This is especially true if the monster is attacking you, since your casting will probably get interrupted, and you'll have wasted all that time to inflict 0 damage.  In general, just save your mana for between-combat heals. <P>
Light Healing is your much-needed replacement for Minor Healing.  Now you can heal a whopping 30hp at once.  If you haven't figured this out yet.  Rangers can't really heal very well.  That's the job for Clerics and Paladins.  Ranger heals are pretty much just for reducing downtime. <P>
Skin like Rock is an upgrade to Skin like Wood, obviously.  Always have it on.
<P>
You get the Hide skill at 25.  This is a sort of stationary-invisibility.  If you move, it breaks.  You also won't know if you've hidden successfully, but the easiest way to find out is con a mob that would normally attack you.  If that dry bone skeleton is looking at you indifferently, instead of scowling, ready to attack, you know you've hidden successfully.  This skill isn't very useful when you could just cast Camouflage, but it doesn't hurt to have.  Both Sneak and Hide have low skill caps for Rangers, so be cautious.  I usually hit my hide hotkey before I go afk for any amount of time, just on principle. <P>

New spells again at 30.  The standouts: <P>

Barbcoat is an improved self-only AC buff and damage shield.  Always have it on.
Cancel Magic will remove your target's magical buffs.  This is nice to have against monsters that have their own damage shields, which are hurting you every time you hit them.  Also handy in duels, to de-buff the other person. <P>
Eyes of the Cat is the long-awaited self-only Infravision spell.  Human Rangers, rejoice.
Invigor will restore your yellow stamina bar.  Nice to have in long fights, or if you're visiting the underwater dungeon of Kedge Keep, where you will always be out of stamina because you will always be swimming.
Shield of Thistles is a damage shield that you can cast on yourself and others, doing 6 damage to the monster every time it hits the person.  It only lasts a minute or two, so you'll need to re-cast it before each fight. <P>
Stinging Swarm is a wonderful spell.  It's a DoT that does about 120 damage to the target over one minute.  It uses the Conjuration skill, so I hope you used Dance of the Fireflies to keep your skill up like I told you to.  Cast this at the beginning of a fight.  You'll get a yellow text message if it wears off, cast it again if the monster still has a good amount of hitpoints.  Otherwise, save your mana. <P>
Strength of Earth is a nice Strength buff, adding 15 points.  Once again, always have it on, and always cast it on your friends.  Unfortunately, this spell doesn't last as long as you might like, so you'll have to refresh it periodically.
<P>
At 35 you get both Riposte and Disarm.  Riposte works like Dodge and Parry, just train one point and it will automatically go up.  When Riposte goes off, you get a free swing at your enemy.  Disarm is something you have to hotkey.  Disarm doesn't work very well agaist monsters.  It doesn't seem to have much affect on their damage output.  Most monsters hit just as hard with their bare hands as they do with a sword.  It's great in duels though.  Also at 35, you automatically meditate when you sit down.  This means you don't have to stare at the spellbook anymore.
<P>
Not much left I can tell you, other than give you a rundown of the nice spells at 39:
<P>
Careless Lightning is a nice DD spell, 99 points of damage. <P>
Healing is a nice spell, good for 90hp or so.  The real advantage is that it's more mana-efficient that your previous two healing spells. <P>
Levitate causes you to hover a few feet off the ground.  It takes one batwing to cast this spell.  The same Erudite woman who sold you those fish scales can sell you these, too.  Levitate is great for running over lava or shark-infested waters. <P>
Skin like Steel.  Always have it on you and on your friends.  You should know that at this point. <P>
Spirit of Wolf is a spell you've probably wanted for a long time.  It lets you run faster.  Much faster.  Only works outdoors though.

<P>
That pretty much brings you up to level 40.  I've tried to cover as much information as I think pertains to Rangers in particular.  I would highly encourage you to read the Warrior and Druid guides as well, just to give you a more complete understanding.  If you have any suggestions for improvements that I can make to this document, please drop me an e-mail (ritsuko_negai@hotmail.com), I'm always open to suggestions.
