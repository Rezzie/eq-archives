Today's edition of the Absor Infobits is supercharged with extra bits from Lawrence Poe:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000208.html"><b>Imbue Ivory</b></a><br>Jaeden_Avengarious wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: For the Deity imbue spells, the level for them set is for 29. The only different one is Imbue Ivory, which is level 34. <br><br>Is there a special reason for this? <br><br>(question for Absor)<br>With the new server allowing Barbarians to worship Mithaniel Marr, could we have this change go to the other servers?

It's pretty hard to deny that they should be able to worship them. And I'll certainly forward your comment and mine to the team. But I wouldn't anticipate any changes to the basic deity restrictions for the existing servers.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000209.html"><b>Evacuate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've brought this up as a bug with Esther twice with no response. I'll assume its not and then simply ask you: why? <br><br>When the wizard spell Evacuate is cast every mana user in the party is charged mana for the spell. As a 57th cleric with a 200 wisdom this spell costs me a full bubble of mana when cast by a wizard. As far as I know this is the only spell in the game that subtracts mana from every caster in the group when cast. <br><br>This is not the largest issue in the game certainly, but its, well, annoying. Because this spell is normally cast in an emergency when things are going badly the additional mana drain just adds to whatever frustration you already had over things going badly. <br><br>So is this a bug, or a 'feature'? If it is intended, why? <br><br>Ezrick Blackpriest<br>Tarew Marr ]</i></font><br><br>-------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>This *is* intentional. Evac is a group spell. One of its components is a mana drain. That component, just like the Evac, will hit every member of the group. This was added to stop people from Evacing to a relative safe area then have the MOBs come after them where they are near the zone line and can easily escape should things go bad. <br><br>Recently we have changed the interzone teleports to clear agro, so that feature of the spell is a little less important. We have talked about removing the mana drain but have yet to make a decision. Hopefully I can give you an answer sometime soon. <br><br>Hope that clears things up for ya. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>-------------------------------------<br><br>Thanks for the question.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000207.html"><b>Critical Hits With Spells</b></a><br>xole wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Here is a possible way to implement critical hits on evocation spells: <br><br>base number = X*(Evoc skill/Spell Level) + (research skill/10) + (specialization Evocation/10). <br><br>Where spell level is the level of the spell being cast. X is a modifier based on class. 2 for wizards, 1 for other classes (if crit hits are not wizard only). <br><br>When a spell is cast get a random number 1-100. If this number is less than the base number a crit hit occurs. When a crit hit occurs, there is no chance for resist and the spell does (base - rand number) extra damage. <br><br>This will max out at about 50% chance if the caster is using their most recently obtained spells. <br><br>Here are a few comments on the idea:<br>1. Max base number is 50. Therefore max crit hit is 150% of norm and max chance for crit is 50%. <br><br>2. Creatures 10 levels higher than caster can not be crit hit. <br><br>3. Creatures over the 6 lvl limit, but under the 10 lvl crit limit can only be hit if a spell crits. <br><br>4. Agro is counted the same as if spell didn't crit. <br><br>5. Research is included to represent that a good researcher would have superiour knowledge of both the mob and the spell. <br><br>6. Crit hits would show up in battle text, just like warrior crit hits do. <br><br>7. Perhaps, the base should be modified for different zones or continents. This could be a way to help balance the classes in different continents. The 50% damage bonus could vary from zone to zone, but I wouldn't make it too high. <br><br>8. It should be noticibly better for wizards, if not wizard only. <br><br>9. Resistant chance reduction is a critical aspect of this idea. <br><br>10. Items which aid this could be introduced, but be careful. <br><br>Oh, and yes, I'm a wizard. I enjoy my class very much. I also play a variety of alts. ]</i></font><br><br>-------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Thanks for the well written suggestion. Critical hits on spells is something we have discussed in the past. I personally think it's an excellent idea, and that it could be balanced to account for the different power scales over our continents. That being said, we don't have the time to allocate adding this type of functionality right now. Critical spell hits would be a big change requiring a lot of play testing. currently there are no plans to add it, but I won't rule it out as a feature that we may decide to add at some point down the road. <br><br>Thanks for the feedback, and glad you enjoy the game so much <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>-------------------------------------<br><br>We get a few suggestions about this every day.

This basically means that you cannot kill a mob with a rain spell solely. It is my opinion this is just an unseen sideaffect of some errant if-then loop or something, rather than an intended behavior.

Before translocate spells were added to the game a dynamic event happened. If you were not fortunate enough witness the event I apologize. I know there are a lot of times when magic just shows up on Norrath, but sometimes it is discovered as opposed to just showing up. We have detailed plans outlining the Translocate line of spells. While I appreciate the feedback, I'm going to ask that you please stop asking for more locations, and simply let the world unfold around you. <br><br>Thanks <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>-------------------------------------<br><br>Guys, we're doing this the way you're always asking us to do it, with in-game plot.

To preface, let me outline what races can be which classes: <br><br>Cleric: Dark Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, Gnome, Halfling, High Elf, Human<br>Druid: Half-Elf, Halfling, Human, Wood Elf<br>Shaman: Barbarian, Iksar, Ogre, Troll <br><br>So anyway, there are a few things we can infer from this, I think. We can note the following: <br><br>1) All races have at least one sort of Wisdom caster. Some races don't have Int casters (Barbarians, Dwarves, Wood Elves, Halflings, Ogres, Trolls, Half-Elves,) but religion is esential. <br>2) The Shaman class is exclusive of both Clerics and Druids (ie, no race can be both a Shaman and a Cleric or Druid.) <br>3) The Druid class is compatable with the Clerics only in two races: Humans and Halflings. All the other races are one or the other. <br><br>The way I see it, there are three religious approaches, and these approaches are not terribly compatable. We have a sort of a stylized and organized worship of a god, that's the way of the Cleric (note the sophistication of just about all the temples.) On the other side, we have a rough, primal embracing of the god and his beleifs, the Shaman. For a Druid, I think that the god is secondary to the worship of Nature itself, thus being limited to the two gods who typify Nature: the one who gives birth, or the one who nurtures life, Tunare and Karana. <br><br>So clearly, Clerics and Shamans require a wholey different way of thinking, and such a thing will never appear in the same race. The closest we get are Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians, who are all the same species, but are very different "breeds." Should the Iksar race manage to regain its heights, then probably the Shamanistic way of thought would dissappear from them completely. Or perhaps some sect of the Iksar would cling to the old ways, at the cost of not embracing the newer way of living (and hence be a different "race," much like Humans and Barbarians or Wood Elves and High Elves.) <br><br>On a related note, I might add that Druidic and Clerical thought are also radically different, and as such are only accessable by the most open minded and flexable of races (humans and their diminutive mirror.) ]</i></font><br><br>That's a fair analysis.

At that time the only source of shark meat on Norrath was living sharks with sharp teeth. The quest rewards were balanced based on the facts of the day. <br><br>Recently we added a bunch of new recipes for bakers. Shark meat was used in one (or some) of those recipes. So shark meat was added on a vendor or two to facilitate the use of that recipe. <br><br>This made the original quest extremely easy for people that could transport themselves. People used this fact to gain rewards beyond the intended difficulty of the quest. <br><br>Sure, we should have caught it. But with the huge number of quests and the large increase in baking recipes and items, we missed it. To fix this we had, really, two choices. Remove the quest or remove the meat from vendors. <br><br>We chose to remove the meat. Bakers don't suffer in their ability to make skill, there are other recipes that will get them through those skill ranges. All this does is make shark dishes a rarity, and that's actually something that I think is a good thing. If someone gives you food with shark meat in it, you know that they've gone to some trouble to make that food.<br><br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000204.html"><b>Pet Questions</b></a><br>pyrian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings, <br><br>I wasn't sure if this was ever brought up, but I just wanted to address it anyway in case it wasn't. I've just recently started a necro character a couple of months ago who is already level 32. As of now, my character has reached the level in which a pet is essential for survival. This means that if I wish to survive an encounter, my pet has to be able to survive the fight. Likewise, to have my pet to survive, it must be able to effectively deal with any mob that it encounters. And to do that, the pet usually has to be armed. <br><br>So my question is this, are there any plans to have necro pets return the weapons it was given when you no longer need the pet? Also, are there any plans to let necro retrieve the weapons given to their pets if their pets die? I think that it would be a great addition, espeically since the necro's primary mode of defense and offense are their pets. Please let us know what you think. Thanks. ]</i></font><br><br>Arming your pet is part of the bargain for using them. Losing that weapon is part of the cost. In a way, this is another one of the slight and perhaps subtle advantages that magicians have over other pet classes, as they can summon weapons for their pets. <br><br>No, we have no intention of allowing pets to return weapons. <br><br>Silfox wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: JanePetOwner casts Invisibility on herself, and Jobober panics and goes poof. Shouldn't it be possible for the caster to cast See Invisible on the pet, then invis herself without the pet suiciding? ]</i></font><br><br>The pet goes away when the owner disappears for game balance reasons as much as for any roleplaying reason. Unfortunately an invisible pet owner could, basically, send an endless chain of pets at an NPC and never be at risk themselves. I mentioned this to Kendrick and he remembered a time in beta when a 15th level character was able to use this trick to easily take on a 28th level NPC with no risk. <br><br>So, yes, it would make sense that if the pet is freaking out and disappearing when the master disappears, then casting See Invisible on the pet would prevent that. But we can't allow pets to be attached to invisible masters for reasons having nothing to do with 'realism' and everything to do with gameplay.</UL>

Every post is seen by me or by the team (or both). Responding to comments takes longer than reading them, and making certain that your comments are read is really the value of this new system. <br><br>In fact, let me respond to your question, to give you some sort of idea why I often don't reply to some sorts of comments (not because they are bad questions, mostly because I don't have good answers). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Last night a guild went to Fear Plane, we cleared golems dracoliche no problem, and began preparing for Cazic Thule. <br><br>We had *52* people, level 58+ with about 2 exceptions. With 5 level 60 Warriors and about 5 level 60 Clerics. <br><br>Charge - Die. We forgot to slow him. <br><br>Next attempt, we only sent in one or two groups and TWO level 60 shamans went OOM trying to slow a tashed/malosi'd/bardsonged CT. No longer slowable?

We got him to 15% by suiciding level 60 wizards and nothing. <br><br>Okay theres my story, I was just wondering if you could confirm this Absor or Abashi? If he is intentionally unslowable (he was slowable a week ago), this makes this mob 10X harder. ]</i></font><br><br>NPCs change all the time. We don't talk about such changes simply because we want you to expect NPCs to change. We aren't announcing changes that might raise Emperor Crush's hit points, we're not in the habit of announcing changes to Cazic either. Only in the case where the change is rather huge will be make an announcement about it. Revamping the whole zone needs to be announced. Changing some stats doesn't. <br><br>Honestly, we make far too many changes to NPCs to announce them all. Hopefully you understand why this isn't the kind of question I'll answer. <br><br>But the team did see it, I talked to them about it, and if this had been a bug or something, we would have dealt with it.

There a particular reason or are you only posting comments that say how great and wonderful everything is? <br><br>-{Run DMZ}- ]</i></font><br><br>You asked about more 'roleplaying' oriented events.

As often as not I would essentially be giving out spoiler information in my response. Heck, just posting most questions would be a bit of a spoiler. <br><br>But I'll tell you that the Greenmist thing is on someone's plate.

I'm not talking speedy regen here. I'm thinking along the lines of a full mana or HP bar in 24-48 hours. <br><br>This is not something that would unbalance anything that I can think of. And it wouldn't be a big boon to Hardcore players.

But I'll go post a few of them once I'm done with this bunch. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: OK you asked for more "original" questions, something that hasn't got a thing to do with "when will this happen?" or "what's this gonna be like?" and it just so happens I *have* one that fits your criteria. =) What is up with the mages' Monster Summoning spells? I can't nail down if you guys ever said what exactly kind of stuff it can summon, but I was told (and it can be logically deduced) that you can only summon creatures that spawn in that zone. This makes ottal sense from what we have been told by you guys about the "Global File" thingy that hold all models that can be displayed in a zone. So back o my question, why is it that it doesn't seem to be true? For instance, my wife is a lvl 43 mage so when we hunt together she likes to use the monster pets because they are more fun to look at and illicit some hilarious responses from other PCs. Well since the spell came out I have noticed that occasionally she gets a critter that doesn't even spawn close to that zone. Such as: a jungle spider summoned from EC, a fungus man summoned in Rathe Mountains, a spiderling summoned in Sol A, etc. Why are these critters in the zone file if they don't ever appear? Is it like some "reserved for future use" thing? I don't mind it I am just curious. I mean someone purposely put these things on the list, right? Seems like these critters could be taken out to make room for some of the other in-zone critters. Like why can you never summon a wurm pet in GD? or a Frost Giant? Being as the Moster Summoning spells are purely "fun" spells (ie-they offer no real tactical advantage), there's no harm in letting us know how it works right? Of course I can see some tactical advantage on PvP servers. I notice a lot of people will stop and try to attack the pet because they think it is attacking the mage. On PvP seems this'd be a great bait and switch tactic, let someone think they will get the killing blow and loot you only to find it was a trap... Anyhoo, if you could answer my question I'd be appreciative =0) Oh and can you please tell Dan to put in a recipe for Malted Milk Balls? We already have chocolate and malted milk, and it'd be really cool to be able to munch down on some =) Thanks! <br><br>Newander<br>Carnival of Carnage<br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br>Paragraphs! Please! :)<br><br>Some zones have creatures in their files that never were used in the design of he zone itself. So while you might not have seen any Fungus Men in the Rathe Mountains, that doesn't mean that the model doesn't exist in the zone file. <br><br>Some creatures are purposefully excluded from the summoning list. I imagine that wurms and most giants are purposefully excluded.

Legal means it's an endorsed tactic, whereas "not illegal" just means that we won't get involved in these player matters. I fully expect the player community to develop a set of their own accepted rules on the server. I expect to see all of the things that are currently "illegal" on the other servers become "frowned upon" by the players of Sullon Zek. It will just be up to you to enforce them, rather than our GM staff. <br><br>-Gordon <br>---------------------------------------<br><br>Gains for PvP activity are too easy to exploit.

The Sullon Zek server, the first Deity Team server in EverQuest's history, was officially announced by Alan in a very big update on the Developer's Corner.  Here's the entire post:<UL>Hello everyone. I've got some news for you that I'm sure you'll like.<br><br>We plan to have the new PvP Deity Teams server up and running some time tomorrow. I also have the name of the new server and the basic rule set for you below.<br><br>What we'll be doing is putting the new server up as a Test server for a short while, a few weeks or it may only be a few days, depending on how things go. In order to play on the server during the testing period you'll have to log in using testeverquest.exe. At the end of the test period we will be wiping all characters from the new server in order to restart it as a Live server.<br><br>The server will be open to anyone that wants to help us test it. You'll have to understand that the standard Test Server disclaimers will apply (see the note below). And our Development Team and Testing Teams will be running around on the server. Please cooperate with them and don't bother them with requests. <br><br>Please use /bug to tell us about any bugs you find with the new rules and PvP code.<br><br>Remember, this is a Test server, and there is no promise of customer service.<br><br>Don't let any of that intimidate you if you want to test out the new rules once we get the server up. Just run testeverquest.exe and start up a character.<br><br>Anyway, on to the rules. This isn't necessarily a final list, we are still thinking of adding and modifying some rules. But this is a pretty good summary.<br><br>----<br><br>Welcome to Sullon Zek, the first Deity Team PvP server.<br><br><b>Important Notice:</b><i><br><br>This server will only be featured on the Test EQ Patch for some time for testing purposes. You will need to run testeverquest.exe to access this server. While this server is featured on the Test Patch, all the conditions that apply to the Test Server also apply to this server. There may be cases where the server comes down multiple times a day for updates. There is also a small chance of corpse or item loss. There will be very little to no initial customer service support. When testing of this server is complete and the server is ready to be introduced to the Live Servers, all characters will be wiped. Below are the new rules specific to this server. But also be aware that these rules may be changed as we feel the need to adjust them.</I><br><br><br>The Sullon Zek server is a new server with a new rule set. The rules for this server are very different than those on any other EverQuest server. In general the server is based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Tallon and Vallon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which god the character worships rather than the race of the character.<br><br>This document includes the PvP rules for Sullon Zek, and a list of the teams for the server. The 'teams' will be referred to as 'alliances' in this document, as they represent an alliance of the gods, rather than some sort of sports team&#8230;<br><br><br><b>Sullon Zek rules:</b><br><br>1. Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply.<br><br>2. Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to participate in PvP combat. The first time a character zones after gaining 6th level he or she will then become PvP enabled.<br><br>3. Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience.<br><br>4. Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse.<br><br>5. Players may only have one character at a time on this server. This means that you will have to delete the existing character in order to create a new one. Because we are introducing a new class and a new race with the release of Shadows of Luclin we plan to make allowances at that time for those that wish to explore these new characters.<br><br>6. Characters will not be able to group with anyone that is not on their Deity Team.<br><br>7. Characters will not be able to invite someone to join their guild that is not on their Deity Team.<br><br>8. Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players current level.<br><br>9. Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player characters.<br><br>10. /consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player characters. 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or 'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 5 levels.<br><br>11. /consider will also display a message indicating what team the target is on. Members of your own team will be displayed as an 'ally', members of another team will be shown as 'threateningly'.<br><br>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves (high elves, wood elves and half elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is not a dwarven home town.<br><br>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on these servers to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning on PvP servers. HOWEVER: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on PvP servers.<br><br>14. Beneficial effects can not be used on members of another team.<br><br>15. No character will be able to bind in dungeon zones.<br><br>16.

Another major incident involving reported GM abuse has rocked the EverQuest community.  Vanamar has a report summing up the guild's version of the story:<BLOCKQUOTE>The Sleeper has been Awakened on Lanys...<br><br>.... and the guild responsible is disbanded, and 30 members suspended.<br> <br>On the evening of Monday, June 4, 2001, Lanys T`Vyl's local "uberguild"<br>invaded sleepers tomb with a force 30 strong.<br> <br>The proceeded down to the Warders area, where four dragons are<br>usually posted to keep watch over the Sleeper, aka Kerafyrm, lest<br>he be unleashed upon the world.<br> <br>Conquest had defeated the first three warders that Saturday,<br>and waited to attempt the fourth warder because their force<br>had grown weary and needed rest.<br> <br>After entering the dungeon and making their way down to<br>the fourth warder, they assaulted him in full force.  They<br>had the dragon beaten down, halfway to his death, but<br>the unexpected suddenly happened...<br> <br>The Sleeper awoke.<br> <br>As the army of Conquest was in the process of slaying the<br>Warder, The Sleeper proceeded to slay him outright, and<br>then began assaulting the members of Conquest.<br> <br>Conquest was eventually defeated, and were recuperating,<br>when the emissaries of the gods arrived, and stated :<br> <br>'Everyone that is in this zone, has a corpse in this zone,<br>or was involved in the invasion of this zone is receiving a<br>warning for Exploitation.'<br> <br>The guild was summarily summoned to the area known as<br>"Arena", and was told that everyone involved was being<br>suspended, and their guild disbanded.<br> <br>Suddenly, they found themselves removed from the world,<br>and could no longer inhabit the bodies they had worked<br>so hard on improving.<br> <br>You can find more news at:<br> <br><a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz">http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz</a><br> <br>- Vanamar Dz`Baernon, 51st Circle Elementalist<br>- Officer of Eternal Sinn, Lanys T`Vyl Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Brad McQuaid, on behalf of Sony, fired back with <a href="http://lumthemad.net/forums/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=comments&Number=14692&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=7&part=all&vc=1">an official statement</a> on Lum's forum.  Here's an excerpt from that post:<UL>On June 4th, 2001, SOE banned and/or suspended 28 players belonging to the guild Conquest. Plainly put, they were cheating, we observed them cheating, they knew they were cheating, they admitted they were cheating, and they got caught. <br><br>While SOE does not want to spoil the game by releasing full details of the cheats to all players, basically the 28 Conquest players were (among other things) purposely using world geometry, aspects of the hate list, the "z" coordinate and its nullification of NPC's ability to summon, and multiple atmospheres (e.g. water/land) to arrange dragon-type encounters so they could attack without getting hit back for the vast majority of the time that it took to kill the monster. In short, what they did was carefully orchestrate 100,000+ hps encounters so that, for 75% or more of the time that it took to kill the encounter, the monster got beaten on and was not able to fight back. </UL>As you know, I dislike tackling GM abuse stories on the frontpage because most the time we can never seem to get to the truth.  Keeping this in mind, I will not be covering this event any further <i>unless</I> something extremely important arises from this incident.  For readers who wish to find out more, this report has provided both sides of the story with links to find out more information from each source.

The latest updates from Alan can be read here in today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar Background</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Actually, the reason I always felt Iksar had shaman instead of clerics was because they were tradtionalists and really do not like change. While they are really no longer a "shamanistic" society, they still cling to their old religion and beliefs. Also, it seems they practice ancestral worship, which would mean communing with the spirits of their ancestors which would again encourage them not to make the change to clerics. <br><br>I have gatherd Iksar society is not chaotic at all, on the contrary it's very, very rigid and organized and fear driven. Do what your told or die sort of thing, and it's a very military like in structure. Your role is determined before you are born, you never question the mystics as they are the mouthpiece of Cazic-Thule and to question Cazic-Thule is to ensure your own death and also bring death to your fellows, as punishment for allowing you to question him. Which encourages them to actively try and destroy those who WOULD question Cazic-Thule, thus preventing any worship besides him. <br><br>Well, I'm really too tired to detail my other speculations about Iksar society and their religion, if you ever want to chat Absor just send me a tell, I greatly enjoy discussing the Iksar and everything about them. <br><br>Zildrax Shathrais<br>High-Mystic of Cazic-Thule<br>Morell Thule Server ]</i></font><br><br>That sounds like a good depiction of the Iksar. <br><br>As for the whole Cleric/Shaman thing, it is probably more accurate to describe their worship of Cazic-Thule as more spiritual, more objectified than, say, the way Dark Elves worship Innoruuk. A Dark Elf (if he was trying to be polite) might describe this kind of worship as unsophisticated. But that's not necessarily the case. It is, however, different and perhaps a little more primal. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hail Absor <br><br>Ripped straight from the everquest.com website, i have a piece of information that may shock and discredit you Absor! <br><br>/quote<br>evil hand of Innoruuk touched this land and spawned the Iksar, a powerful reptilian race<br>/quote <br><br>where did i find the pearl of knowledge? at this address:<br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/atlas/kunark.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/atlas/kunark.jsp</a> <br><br>Absor, Cazic-thule is a big jerk! he keeps stealing Innoruuks worshippers.. or perhaps he just intimidates them into worshipping him. I am such a good spin doctor i think i should be doing Absor's job, i may have answered my own question! ]</i></font><br><br>More likely, someone just wrote the wrong blurb for the map page&#8230; :)<br><br>I'll ask someone to look into it and maybe we can polish that pearl a bit.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000193.html"><b>Rallos Zek Faction Hits</b></a><br>Ok, I made an error. <br><br>The changes to faction hits for Rallos Zek will be going in with our next patch, not with this last one. This last patch was a minor thing that had only a few changes in it, and this was not one of them. <br><br>The King Tormax change did happen with this patch though.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000194.html"><b>Patch Message - Or Lack Thereof</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello Absor, <br><br>Bored at work and noticed that there was no patch message listed on this board or under the website. I always look forward to patch messages..go figure. Was the patch delayed or was it just to small to post the changes? <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Galadin Trenchant<br>42 Warrior]</i></font> <br><br>Sorry. There really was no patch message&#8230; Here's what's on the front page of everquest.com: <br><br>----------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Today's patch consisted only of server-side data, and does not contain anything that would normally be announced. <br>----------------------<br><br>That's pretty much it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000182.html"><b>Auto-play</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: There is actually a better way to turn off the auto-play (known to the windows operating system as Auto-insert notification) <br><br>-Right-click on My Computer and click Properties<br>-Click the Device Manager tab<br>-You should now see a listing for CD Rom with a plus sign to the left of it. Click that plus sign<br>-There should now be listed at least one CD Rom drive. Select the one you wish to disable the autoplay function and click the properties button at the bottom of the list<br>-Click the settings tab. You should now be able to find a check box for Auto insert notification. Unclick that and hit OK a few times and you are done. <br><br>May take a few extra steps, but it saves you from the possibility of messing up anything in the file types.. and those can be a real pain to fix... <br><br>Elasah<br>52nd Dwarf Cleric of Brell Serilis<br>Terris-Thule server ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks! <br><br>I would recommend this method myself.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000183.html"><b>Spell Messages</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: the Shaman Spell - Spirit Sight has No text displayed when you cast it on someone else, if you cast it on yourself you get a message "Your eyes tingle" but unless you're looking at the party member and they're facing you so you can see the little Eye Sparkle graphic, you have no way of knowing it took hold. <br><br>I think there is the same problem with the "see invisible" spell <br><br>Sylviania Delaforet<br>Pathfinder of Tunare ]</i></font><br><br>Noted.
