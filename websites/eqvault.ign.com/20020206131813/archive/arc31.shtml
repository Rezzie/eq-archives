Any word? <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Vanayr ]</i></font><br><br>We had another meeting last Friday on possible changes to the way PvP works in EverQuest. We want to make sure we're headed in the right direction before we announce anything. I wouldn't expect an announcement about changes to PvP until well after the Fan Faire this week. Since a lot of the folks that make changes and decisions about changes also go to Fan Faire, this will be a busy week for us, and making final decisions about this won't happen this week.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000034.html"><b>/Corpse Bug</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Z-Axys /corpse changed? <br><br>Before a recent patch, you used to be able to /corpse bodies up through the trap to where you zone in to Howling Stones. Last night, we had my group had a wipe out and tried to do our usual drag to zone and found out the hard way that we could no longer /corpse bodies up to be res'd. <br><br>Was a limit put on z-axys /corpse? Was this a bug in the past that was recently fixed?]</i></font> <br><br>It looks like this was a bug. There seems to be a problem with /corpse and its ability to pull a corpse up (or down) the z-axis. We should have it fixed in the patch this week. <br><br>Thanks for pointing this out. But I want to urge you to send bug reports in using the form on the Quality Assurance board rather than this one. Your message had to pass through an extra step (I had to send it to Ester) when you sent it here. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000033.html"><b>Where's Auric?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: The New Boards <br><br>Hi Absor, <br><br>I have to say that although I miss certain aspects and personalities from the old message boards, that I find the new boards *much* more useful.

A <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000002.html">few Direct X issues</a> were addressed by Brad McQuaid and Rowyl and the Developers Corner recently.  The following excerpt is a complete copy of Brad's post:<UL><i>Yes, we did make some DX intitialization code changes that should enable us in the future to take advantage of newer 3D cards and their feature sets.<br><br>There are a few problems associated with this code that are affecting some players. Addressing these issues and getting a new client up is a priority and we appreciate everyone's patience in the matter.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>Another important post in this thread was from Rowyl:<UL>RE: new features available as a result of the new DX initialization code.<br><br><i>Please note, these features only work with D3D, so don't try them if you are using Glide.</I><br><br><b>32 Bit Color Rendering</b><br>If your video card supports 32 Bit color 3D rendering then you can turn this on. Currently, the way to turn this on is via editing your eqclient.ini file. Look for the line that reads VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16 and change the 16 to a 32. Not only does this use 32 bit color rendering, but it utilizes 24 or 32 bit Z-Buffering (depending on your card) which improves the visual quality of many zones. Cards that I know will work are ones based on the nVidia TNT or Geforce chipsets, ATI Rage 128 and Radeon cards, and 3Dfx Voodoo 4 or 5 cards. There are others, you can check your video card manual or box to see if it lists 32bit color rendering as a feature. Cards that we know do not support 32bit color rendering are the Voodoo 1, 2, or 3, and nVidia Riva 128 based cards (like the STB Velocity 128 and others).<br><br><b>DirectX Texture Compression</b><br>This feature will work with any system or card. When enabled it will compress the textures at load time greatly reducing the memory needed to run without swapping to the hard disk. However, it will increase your load time, primarily between server select and character select. If you have a system with more then 128 MB of ram then you probably don't need to turn this on and suffer the longer load times. However, if you are running with 64 MB or less then this could help with your in game performance at the cost of a little extra load time. You turn this one on by editing your eqclient.ini and changing the line that reads UseD3DTextureCompression=FALSE to be TRUE instead. Also, note your video card does NOT need to support DXTC for this feature to work, however if it does you will gain a little more performance from it.</UL>Thanks Skip!

<a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid986094600,32098,">Where Silence Reigns</a> is Shadoe's latest commentary on recent events in the EverQuest community.  The topic he deals with is the recent decision by Sony Online Entertainment to close down the Gameplay Board and most of the official board system with it.  Here's a clip:<UL>Well, it's happened. The last straw has been placed on the camel's back, and Verant's teeming superhighway of thoughts and ideas has been condemned due to excessive roadkill. Okay... perhaps not condemned, per se, but undergoing some serious downgrading to an old, dusty mountain trail by comparison. Even so, now players are given the latitude of actually reading up on current issues without wading through the parade of Jerry Springer Show rejects to do it. I say more power to them, and for more reasons than one. </UL>You can respond to the editorial by following <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=10387034&start=10387034"><b>this link</b></a> to the discussion thread.

New messages were posted by Alan to the Developer's Corner today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000023.html"><b>Guild Message of the Day</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: New functionality: /guildmotd ("guild message of the day") <br><br>When executed by guildmaster, it stores a text message server side in his guild's record in the guild database. Length of text same as maximum permitted for tells, etc. <br><br>When members of the guild log on, the message is played back to them automatically. The message can also be replayed at any time by any guild member by executing /guildmotd <br><br>This is a very high value-added feature to guild life. It's a powerful and simple way to get 50 people to go to the same place at the same time for an event at short notice. Many guilds use message boards to try to coordinate and plan events (e.g. raids) in advance, but there are ALWAYS people who show up late or not at all for guild events because they didn't read the board, they didn't remember the right time etc. <br><br>It's been suggested many times and every time tons of your customers supported the idea as a great one, but it seems it just doesn't reach the right set of ears in VI. <br><br>Datalore<br>The Rathe ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, it has already reached the right ears. I've been told that this is on the list of things that we want to do. It's not a real high priority item, though, and I don't have any sort of a timeframe for its implementation. But we've certainly heard the request, and we rather like the idea.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000022.html"><b>Sign  Your Comments</b></a><br>When you send us your comments, please sign them at the bottom with your character name or real name, or whatever name you want us to use. It would be nice to have a name to put with the letters that we post.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000027.html"><b>Board Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: suggestion for boards <br><br>Could you guys make it so there was some tracking information automatically put in the subject line of the Submit Comment form? So that the post we were responding to (if we were responding to a post on the boards) would be clearer. Just a though....I really like the new boards overall, they've become a place to visit again! <br><br>Tali ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I think a lot of people misunderstand how the "Submit Comments" thing works. I should have explained it. Thanks for bringing it up. <br><br>When you hit the "Submit Comment" button, you are opening a web form. That form does not know the title of the subject that you are replying to. So when you are sending in your comments, if you want to refer to a specific post, please list it in the subject. The form does not know which subject you are replying to, and so it can't tell us. We've received several messages from people that spend several paragraphs talking about a particular item. By the end of the message I still don't know what there are referring to because they didn't mention it specifically in the message, and it wasn't in the subject line. <br><br>So please, make sure to be clear with your subject line when sending comments. <br><br>In the mean time, I'll see if the web team can get your suggestion implemented. Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000025.html"><b>Fearsome Shield</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I looked thru the patch message and saw only one change involving the Fearsome shield, something about the effect on it. I'm curious if the fact that it can no longer be worn in the backslot was a typo by one of the programmers or an intended change. <br><br>If this was an intended change, how can we get the shield to a class that will actually use the shield after this change with it being nodrop? <br><br>Thanks for the reply in advance. <br><br>Razzum<br>60 Warlord of OoP, Saryrn ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, the change was intentional. We most certainly should have announced it, I'm sorry that we didn't. However, as the item is no-drop, announcing the change probably wouldn't have made too much of a difference to those that have the shield. <br><br>We are not going to be transferring these no-drop shields. As a shield, it is one of the best (arguably THE best) in the game. Allowing it to be worn as a 40 armor class cloak was an error on our part, and for that we are sorry. But as a back item it was far too powerful.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000024.html"><b>Ranger Best of the Best postponed until the 16th</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: A few weeks ago I was helping your new event coordinator rule out some things for the Ranger BoTB. After we were done, he said it would probably start around April 4th or so. However, the Fan Faire is that weekend and a lot of Rangers could miss coming to the tourney due to that. <br><br>So, if you were planning on having it that soon, could you please postpone it untill after the Fan Faire? Cause I know some people wouldn't want to miss both of those events. =) <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Sean the Scaled Claw<br>Level 60 Warder<br>Veeshan ]</i></font><br><br>I just talked to our Event Coordinator. She tells me that the Ranger Best of the Best has been postponed until April 16th. With all of the work we have to do to set up Fan Faire, and with as many attendees as we expect (many of which will be rangers), it wouldn't be a wise idea to try to do the Best of the Best on the 4th.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000030.html"><b>Patch On April 4th</b></a><br>We've decided to push the patch back a day so that we can have a little more time to catch and squish the remaining video bugs and crash bugs. <br><br>So the new patch announcement is: <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: quote: <br><br>On Wednesday, April 4th, at 3AM PST, all servers will be down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 9 hours. ]</i></font><br><br>Just thought you'd like to know.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000029.html"><b>Flame Lick</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Flame lick is a level 1 druid spell that is a dot. <br><br>All druid races except wood elfs have fire beetles near there home towns, as you need a fire beetle eye to cast all of the immolation series of spells , flame lick being the first in that spell series. The problem is there on no firebeetles on the continent that Kelthin resides on. This for all practical purposes means wood elf can not use this spell till they are old enough to travel to the closet town freeport to get a eye. ]</i></font><br><br>That's an interesting problem. I hadn't noticed it before. Somebody will take a look at it. You might be seeing some new bugs in Elf land.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000028.html"><b>Left Handed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I know this is an extremely low priority, and I do not know if it has even been considered as the tompic was always mass flooded with flames, but has it ever been discussed on the possibility of creating a Left Handed character? <br><br>It just feels odd to me (being left handed) to see a view of my characters with their weapon in the right hand. <br><br>Also, I am pleased with the way the boards have turned out. I have been visiting the boards since September of 1999, and this relief from the flames is well deserved. Congrats. <br><br>Mazteer Cazteer <br>40 Erudite Enchanter<br>Home: Bristalbane ]</i></font><br><br>This would certainly be a nice feature. But the reality is that in order to add left-handed characters we would have to recreate the animations for all of those characters. It's certainly a great idea, though, and I'll mention it to the team. It's just that with the resources we would need to make this work, we could probably add a lot of content in other places.</UL>

I have noticed that in the past even though there was a trade skill board Yak would not post responses often and I was wondering if the trade skills concerns will be looked at? Please quell this poor tinker's fear that our concerns are going to fall by the way side with this new system of message boards. <br><br>Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. <br><br>Gnormey ]</i></font><br><br>I'll still be forwarding questions to Yak. He may or may not reply here personally, but any responses that I make about trade skills will be information that I've gleaned from him. Keep sending in your trade skill questions along with the others. Your concerns will not fall by the wayside.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000014.html"><b>Alchemy Items</b></a><br>I've had a few requests about two alchemy items. <br><br>The Field of Bone Gate potion does not yet have a 5 or 10 combination version. This is being added, and will hopefully be in the next patch. For now, don't try to combine these potions, since you will be trying to create an item that just doesn't exist yet. <br><br>Kilva's Skin of Flame has the same effect as Kilva's Blistering Flesh. This is also being looked at right now, and hopefully will be fixed for the next patch.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: Shaman FoB Gate Components <br><br>As of now, the shaman FoB gate component Sandalwood is not available in Cabilis or Halas. Is this intentional?]</i></font> <br><br>That was unintentional. We'll try to get that fixed and updated for the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000013.html"><b>Coldain Tailoring Kit vs Large Tailoring Kit </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: In the last patch, is was made so that Velious tailoring recipies can only be made in the Coldain Tanning Kit. Prior to this, tailors had been using the Large Sewing Kit for both Velious and old world recipies. <br><br>The Coldain Tanning Kit will currently combine both Velious and old world recipies. Is this intentional, or should we hang on to our Large Sewing Kits a while longer? ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, specialty kits should work for basic recipes. Any recipe that doesn't require a special container to combine in will work in any container of the same type. But if it requires a special container, then you will need that special container to combine the recipe.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000011.html"><b>Queen in Chardok - Ancient Blade </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: For warrior epic the bottleneck is the queen in chardok. it takes massive hours to get to her and kill her. She is no pushover either. It takes great dedication and pullers who know what they are doing. The risk is very great because of trains there. Currently the blade is very rare. <br><br>i would appreciate if this issue was brought forward to the dev team. thank you <br><br>Dindol Phoenixfyre<br>57 Dwarf Warrior<br>Druzzil Ro ]</i></font><br><br>The drop on this particular item was looked into a little while ago. It should already be appearing much more frequently.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000010.html"><b>Adamite Bo-Stick </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This monk weapon procs a AOE lightning spell that actually damamges the user. Is this by design? This would be a pretty decent monk weapon if it didn't have that flaw. Because of it nobody uses it. <br><br>Frostfist Coldeve<br>Monk of the 44th season,<br>Fellowship of Luclin ]</i></font><br><br>All area of effect spells will damage the caster. With this weapon you get a trade-off. You suffer some damage when it procs, but you get to damage multiple opponents. There are certainly places where this weapon would be exceptionally useful. <br><br>Yes, this was intentional. As one of the designers put it, this item is 'balanced differently'.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000019.html"><b>Roleplaying or just playing?</b></a><br>Which is it for you? <br><br>I asked members of the team what it was that they would want to know from our customers. Bill Coyle, generally cool guy as well as an Assistant Producer for EverQuest, had this question: <br><br>"I'd be really interested to know how many of our people actually enjoy roleplaying their character, you know, Paladins that would never group with a dark elf, etc." <br><br>Since we've been talking about roleplaying servers, this seemed like a good question to pass on. But this isn't really a poll. I would rather generate a bit of a discussion on the topic of roleplaying based on Mr. Coyle's (he makes me call him mister Coyle) :)  question than just getting yes or no answers.<br><br><br>Do you enjoy roleplaying your character, even if it might come at the expense of losing out on opportunities, like your paladin not grouping with a Dark Elf? If so, maybe you can explain to us how it is that this is 'fun', rather than a restriction on your gameplay. <br><br>If not, why not? <br><br>Myself, I've 'compromised' the role of my characters on occasion to meet a personal need. But that doesn't happen very often. Some of the most fun I've ever had playing a computer game have been generated by seemingly innocuous encounters with other roleplayers. I've played a dark elf that has spent his time doing his duty as a follower of Hate by criticizing those that help lesser races. The conversations, discussions about the nature of 'hate' and the quips that have come from it have entertained me many dark nights in Neriak. <br><br>So send in your comments to the questions through the submit comment form. Make certain to make the subject Roleplaying or just playing? so that we can sort them out properly.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000017.html"><b>Obtaining "Mastery" In Racial Skills</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I am noticing more and more quests and trade skills using foraged items. I am a wood elf rogue and I had a 50 skill in foraging when I was born, and I'll get to level 60 without once improving my skill. This seems odd in a role playing sense. I should get at least a little better over time. <br><br>I am not requesting much of a change, more like only 2 points of skill per level starting at 0. Hence, my first possible increase would be at level 26. <br><br>Level 25: Skill 50 (min)<br>Level 26: Skill 52<br>Level 30: Skill 60<br>Level 40: Skill 80<br>Level 50: Skill 100 (max) <br><br>I don't see any imbalancing issues since foraging is a marginal skill to begin with, and the special items foraged only occur at skill level 100, so only the most talented high end wood elf will benefit. <br><br>I don't see why this cannot be attributed to other racial skills such as halfling's hide ability. <br><br>Thanks for your time and consideration. <br><br>Vaslin Slickfinger<br>Tarew Marr ]</i></font><br><br>For the Wood Elf Rogue the forage skill is a freebie, a racial bonus. Similarly the hide ability for all Halflings that don't get it from their class. While I suppose that allowing those racial skills to raise to a 'mastery' level might not unbalance the game, it would reduce the value of those skills for those that get them as part of their class.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000016.html"><b>Posion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Most of the 'useful' rogue poisons (level 50-60 useful) never become trivial. Is this by design, or a bug? ]</i></font><br><br>This was intentional. The best items that any craftsperson can make should always be a challenge to them. These are the pinnacle of the craft. This applies to the art of poison making as well.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000009.html"><b>Full Screen Graphics</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi! <br><br>I was hoping that Rowyl could post an ETA for finializing the full screen graphics (such as viewing the spellbook, trade window, etc). Or maybe where they are on his priority list if he doesn't have an ETA? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Seggy<br>Warrior on Sol Ro ]</i></font><br><br>We don't have any estimates about when we'll get the upgrades to the interface changes. There are several other projects that Rowyl is working on at the moment. We do our best to keep him extremely busy.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000018.html"><b>Colorblind Players</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I believe I asked about this before but it got lost in the meriad of useless posts. As far as my research into configs for the game goes, there does not seem to be any way to change the color of the target's health bar. Currently it is a (or so I'm told) a dark red color. This is a serious problem for me when I am in areas with a somewhat dark background, including almost all interior dungeons. I can't distinguish the target's life bar at all. Would it be possible to put in a config to change this life bar to some RGB color code? <br><br>thanks, and kudos on the new forums. <br><br>--Gotte, Druzzil Ro ]</i></font><br><br>Right now the target's health bar is indeed dark red. You should be able to make it much more visible if you change the color of the background for the target box to something solid and light. Use the /wincolor command to accomplish this. You might want to use something like /wincolor target 100 100 100 4. This will make the box a sort of solid light gray. You can increase the first three numbers and the color will appear more white. The basics for the /wincolor command are this: "/wincolor" is the command name. The first three numbers are RGB color numbers. Try different ones to get some idea how they work (like 0 0 100 is dark blue). And the last digit is the transparency value. 4 is solid, 1 is very clear. If you type /wincolor in game with no parameters it will give you more information. <br><br>I hope that helps. I don't know that we'll be changing the color of the health bar itself, since this feature has the same effect.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000012.html"><b>Multiple Tells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: One enhancement that I would like to see is the ability to send the same tell to multiple people. On the mud that I play, it was simple, you just need to seperate the names with a comma. <br><br>I hope it isn't too hard to do the following: <br><br>/tell player1,player2,player3 How are you doing? <br><br>I had posted this on the wishlist board previously. I thought I'd re-iterate it. <br><br>Crolack<br>Guild Scribe<br>The Last Bastion<br>Povar ]</i></font><br><br><br>This isn't a bad idea. I've sent it to the team. <br><br>But you can send tells to multiple people now with relative ease. With the newest changes to the chat bar you can simply hit Shift and the Up Arrow to bring up the text of you last tell, then hit shift+home and change the name.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: Re: Multiple Tells <br><br>Unless Im mistaken, Shift Home brings you to the start of the line, where you have to press shift-right about 7 times before you get to the name, then shift over to the end of the name and hit backspace and retype the new one. It can get annoying. Also, the delete key will not delete text after it like in most programs, can this be fixed? =) <br><br>Darsant ]</i></font><br><br>Shift-right will now repeat, so you just have to hold down the keys to move. It's actually pretty easy and fast to replace the names now. It is true that the delete key doesn't work, though.</UL>

Ristorette announced a new event on the Innoruuk server:<BLOCKQUOTE>99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall!<br><br>Come one, come all, to the airy treetops of Kelethin to participate in the <br>Knights Hospitaller's quasi-annual Drunken Fun Run through the home of the <br>Wood Elves!<br><br>The agenda is thus: <br>Race Group 1 (Newbie): <br>All Noobs level 1-5 are invited to get hammered and run like wild people <br>through the treetops while your elders laugh hysterically at your young bodies <br>crashing to the ground. There is no entrance fee for this race. The prize is a <br>bag full of goodies.<br><br>Race Group 2 (Intermediate): <br>All players level 6 and higher are called to prove their inebriated dexterity <br>to the Noobs they were laughing at shortly before. The entry fee for this race <br>is 1pp/5 levels. The prize is a bag full of stuff better than the previous <br>bag.<br><br>Race Group 3 (Steel Cage Death Match): <br>All players of all levels are challenged to navigate Kelethin's windy walkways <br>while essentially peering through a spyglass the wrong way. The entry fee for <br>this is also 1pp/5 levels. The prize is a big deal thing that we'll figure out <br>once the Knights have picked through our pockets. It'll be something better <br>than lint. We'll also be divvying up whatever leftover entry fee money there <br>is after buying the alcohol.<br><br>Race 4 (Guild Pride): <br>One representative from every guild shall get absolutely wasted and show what <br>good drunks come from their guild. The main prize here is going to be the <br>ability to brag about your guild being the best buncha drunks on the server.<br><br>Rules: <br>No speed enhancement spells/songs/potions/rabbits' feet. <br>No 'safety nets' such as levitate. <br>Alcohol will be provided. <br>If the interest is exceedingly high, we'll do heats, probably <br>single-elimination. <br>If you fall off, you are out. <br>If you die, you are out. <br>The Knights Hospitaller will not be responsible for any experience lost during <br>the course of this race, nor any children that might be conceived as a product <br>of this race. <br>Other rules may be announced at race time as we figure out the best ways to <br>cheat our game.<br><br>The course: <br>Run from the Druid Guild to the Rogue Guild without falling off/dying in the <br>shortest time, and win. Officials of the Knights Hospitaller will be at the <br>start and end, as well as posted at various points along the race course.<br><br>Please show up in Greater Faydark at 3pm EDT (12 noon PDT), April 1st for <br>registration for the newbie race. Registration announcements for other races <br>will be given during the course of the preceeding races. The races will start <br>promptly at 4pm EDT (1 pm PDT).<br><br>Don't forget to set your clocks forward one hour Saturday night, the 31st of <br>March.<br><br>Thank you, <br>Ristorette, 54 Druid <br>Capitular Baliff of the Priory of Antonica <br>Knights Hospitaller</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Playing both an enchanter and a Paladin, I happen to see this one quite a bit...]</i></font> <br><br>This deals with Mend, bandaging and any other issues that deal with timing. They are still working on fixing it completely. <br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000007.html"><b>Resists</b></a><br>This is my first one of these so bear with me! <br><br>Email text: <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This issue has come up before, but I never saw an answer. There is a widely held perception (especially in very powerful guilds) that resists over a certain amount (the amount cited varies, but usually above around 220) are considered to be more harmful than good. I have particular interest in this as a bard, as resists is one of the few things that I offer powerful guilds on big raids. <br>As anecdotal evidence that this perception may be true, on a trakanon raid I recently attended, I was in a caster group. Four of us in the group had 210-250 poison resist with my songs up. The other two were testing this theory, and left theirs at around 180 with my songs. After Trakanon fell, we compared notes, and all four of us with 210+ PR got poisoned. The two that had the lower resists did NOT get poisoned. <br>Obviously, this is a small sample size, and could just be strange luck, but it concerns me that it is a widely held perception, and would like a statement that it has been tested and is in fact false, or it's been tested, and true, and we're fixing it. :)<br>Thank you for your time. <br>Laluni Songhammer<br>52 Bard of E'Ci. ]</i></font><br><br>The perception is indeed false. The problem is that the saves against dragon weapons are different than the saves in the rest of the game. With a resist that would make you basically involunerable against a 'normal' (ie non dragon) MOB a dragon is going to be able to still hurt you. <br><br>Most of the time people max out their resists only when fighting mobs of this level, so I understand where the perception comes from. However we have tested this and the stats and they do not roll over. <br><br>Thanks!<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000006.html"><b>How This Works</b></a><br>Hello everyone! <br><br>As you have seen we have made some significant changes to these boards.

It means that the spam, flames and other messiness will no longer be here. <br><br>You will not be able to post on this forum. When you fill out the form it sends an email to me. Please be polite and informative. I need locs, zones and all the information necessary for me to reproduce your bug. <br><br>It also means that because I do not have to moderate a board I will have more time to answer questions. It is still not my primary responsibility, but I think that more questions will be answered and more information will be available. <br><br>What we ask you to do is to read the posts to see if your question is already answered, and if it is not please use the form provided to email us. We will take the most commonly asked questions and post them and the answers. Absor is doing this to a much more extensive scale in another section. <br><br>Please only send bug related questions. Anything development related or customer service related will not be answered. Also, anything vulgar or inappropriate sent could have consequences on your EverQuest account, so please be polite. Remember that I have to read these emails. <br><br>We hope that this new format will let us communicate with you guys more clearly. By not having to dig through hundreds of posts we hope you will find the information you need more quickly and find that information more concise. <br><br>Please do not be offended if your question is not answered. I or my team read each email but we do not have time to respond to every email. <br><br>We are excited about this new system and look forward to answering your emails.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000005.html"><b>Crashing Today</b></a><br>If you are crashing because of this latest patch please be paitent.

Different perhaps, but still pretty much the same.

I would allow for a greater customization of character. </b><br><br>Unfortunately, each item colored in such a way is actually an entirely different item from others like it. This is an unfortunate limitation of the EverQuest engine. So creating such items would take a lot of time and would use up a lot of database space.<br><br><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000007.html"> Necro Epic, Black Silk Cape Overly Rare? </b></a><br><b>I am concerned that the drop rate on this "bottleneck" piece of the necro epic weapon is far too low. I my self have killed over 20 keepers now and not seen it drop( i know i have bad luck.) Recently you made certain pieces of certain quests much easier to obtain. I ask only that this portion of the necro epic be looked at and reevaluated. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Slie </b><br><br>Actually, Slie, we didn't make any of the epic quests 'easier'. We did, however, move some of the epic quest items off of NPCs that were highly contested for other items that they dropped as loot. There was just too much competition over such NPCs. The actual difficulty in obtaining those items hasn't really been changed, nor has the frequency of their appearance in the game. <br><br>I will, however, pass your concern about the Black Silk Cape to the team.<br><br><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000008.html"> Kudos on the boats "announcing" themselves! </b></a><br>Good job on the boats, it's equivalent to boat flashing the dock with a mirror or starting a smokepot when they see land. </b><br><br>Thanks. You're referring to the fact that boats now call out (well, the captain does) when they reach certain destinations, like arriving in a zone. I think it's a great addition to the game. <br><br>Oh, and for those that are sending in comments, if you sign your letter I'll make sure that the signature is included if I post it here.<br><br><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000004.html">About The Changes</b></a><br><b>Subject: About the new boards... <br><br>I am a bit confused as to what each of the "comment only" boards is for. I would guess that "QA" is more based around what the game is presently while the developer's board would be more for "wishlist" or suggestions. Still, it seems these two areas often overlap. Is there any way we could get a bit more definition of which forum we should send our respective comments to? As I think about it more... this should probably have been sent to QA, I apologise in advance. </b><br><br>Actually, this is the right place. The Developer's Corner Board is a more general board than the Quality Assurance board. Send your bug reports trough the Quality Assurance form. Send other concerns to the Developer's Corner form. This board is for feedback regarding just about any sort of EverQuest related material, except bugs and similar items. Those will get better attention through the Quality Assurance board. <br><br><b>Subject: The Newbie Zone <br><br>TNZ was nothing like this, and there was no problem with it. I found it to be the most reliable and valuable single resource on the net. It was also the friendliest. By taking Gen-Dis away (Where i NEVER went after a few readings that scared me) will have all those people posting in TNZ now. Unless you plan to police it 24=7. <br>Matrumlus<br>Tholuxe Paells </b><br><br>The Newbie Zone will be coming back up soon. I agree that the Newbie Zone is a great forum, where players new to the game could get advice from experienced players. And that's exactly what we hope will continue to happen at the Newbie Zone when it returns. We will work hard to keep that community whole. I wanted to thank those of you that have helped to make that board what it is, and I hope you'll return to it once it comes back up. <br><br><b>Subject: A great change <br><br>I would just really like to compliment you on what I think is a great change is to the forums. I like to come here and read up on the information and bugs that are currently in game. However, what I have noticed in the past is that the bad attitude on the boards carried over when I played the game. When I didn't read the boards I had a much better attitude about the game. I have always enjoyed this game, and there have been very few times I have not been satisfied. Thank you for making it so I can get information on changes, and the game without letting the negative attitude of the previous forums carry over into the game. </b><br><br>This was one of my personal concerns about the old message boards. At the most recent Fan Faire in Baltimore I heard that from perhaps twenty-five percent of the people that I spoke to. I would introduce myself and they'd introduce themselves. I tell them what I do for Verant and they'd tell me that they didn't read the boards anymore because it made them unhappy. They would also tell me that since they stopped reading the message boards they had enjoyed playing EverQuest a lot more.<br> <br>Such comments had a big impact on me. And this was certainly one of the motivating factors for the change. <br><br><b>Subject: Where can concerns still be raised? <br><br>I understand some of the reasons why the boards were changed, but if you do not get feedback on the boards, you will not know what needs fixed (and I understand players are not always right about this), and it seems to be a convenient way to ignore issues that Verant does not wish to address. </b><br><br>This is the place to raise your concerns. <br><br>This new feedback process is a lot more efficient for us. It will make it much easier for us to find issues that are of concern to our customers. <br><br>We will not be ignoring issues. I understand how it might seem that way at first. But I assure you that your issues will get more attention from us this way than they could have in the past. I urge you to keep reading the boards and keep sending in your questions and concerns. I think we'll be able to show you how effective this will be if you stick with us and keep telling us what you want us to hear.<br><br><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000004.html"> Graphic Issues With Latest Patch </b></a><b><br>As of the most recent patch, there have been issues with the graphics quality of the game, such as the Firiona Vie splash screen not taking the entire screen and still being able to see the Desktop, to desktop icons and even the Windows Clock being visible over EverQuest, even playing in F10 full-screen mode. <br><br>Almost all the other members in my guild experienced the same issue. Is this the result of an error during patching server-side, or is it client video card drivers? <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>J.W. Koebel (Gamamen Darkensoul, Bristlebane Server) </b><br><br>It probably would have been better to send this question to the Quality Assurance folks. I'm not picking on you, I just wanted to make sure that people understood what kind of things should go to which board. <br><br>And, well, this exact thing happened on my machine here at work, so I can make a bit of a comment here. I know that the programmers are aware of this problem, I dragged one over to my cube to see it. <br><br>I was able to play just fine by changing my screen resolution in-game so that it didn't match the resolution of my desktop. Try changing the resolution in-game, see if that helps for now. <br><br>But at this point I need to remind you that I'm not a tester or a programmer, so I can't promise that this will work&#8230; :)<br><br><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000005.html"> Helm Models </b></a><br><b>Help, some of the helm models no longer show up after the 3/27/01 patch. My barbarian in an Ulthork hide skullcap nolonger has a helm model. PLEASE FIX THIS. </b><br><br>This change was intentional. The item you are referring to is a skullcap, not a helm. There was never any intention that it would have a helm graphic. A skullcap is a rather small item, and it seems more logical that it not show up at all than have it show up as a full-fledged helmet.</UL>

A big announcement was posted by Alan VanCouvering this evening.  Sony Online Entertainment has shutdown the Gameplay Board and have created a different solution for submitting feedback.  In this post Alan gives his reasons for the change:<UL><I>Hello all.<br><br>We've made some changes to the message boards, as you can see. The letter below is from the team.<br><br>Alan<br><br><br>------------<br><br>Hello all,<br><br>Upon EverQuest&#8217;s release, Sony Online Entertainment, then a separate company, came to Verant Interactive and proposed that they set up and host community message boards on the EverQuest site. The purpose of these boards was to provide a place for EverQuest players to hang out, get to know each other, and basically do what EverQuest players do in any of dozens of message forums hosted by EverQuest fan sites. <br><br>As they grew more popular, a culture of dedicated and knowledgeable players formed, and the forums quickly evolved into a place where game design concepts were discussed freely by a relatively small group of people. As a developer always open to new ideas, the boards did not go unnoticed by the EverQuest design team, and we began commenting on issues there regularly. <br><br>As the weeks went on, some EverQuest players heard that the &#8220;Official&#8221; EverQuest forums were the place to go if you wanted to speak with the EverQuest Development Team. As issues were addressed, it was apparent that the boards were a phenomenal tool for collecting player feedback, listening to issues, and occasionally to release information. <br><br>In late 1999, we decided to even further our commitment to communicate with players about development issues &#8211; a philosophy that remains true to this day. And it seemed the boards were the best place to do this. To that end, a full-time Community Relations Manager was hired to not only disseminate information to the public via the boards, but also to bring the public&#8217;s issues to the development team such that valid player issues would be addressed and not overlooked &#8211; the latter part being key. <br><br>Fast-forward to today: Unfortunately, the EverQuest message boards are often a hotbed of exaggerated negativity where only through one-upmanship, melodramatics, and dauntless persistence can one hope to create a big enough thread surrounding an issue as to have it addressed. Posters with the opportunity and time to engage in these tactics at least get to see an Official tell them &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221;, while others with equally valid stated concerns and the same desire to make the game better for everyone see their posts fall off within minutes, only to be overlooked or missed in the end. That, or they simply don&#8217;t post at all, avoiding the boards and the negativity found therein (we&#8217;ve received a lot of player feedback via email and at Fan Faires attesting to this phenomenon).<br><br>Well, this is simply not acceptable. Our original goal for the boards was to have them serve as a place where valid player issues would be addressed and not overlooked. We need and want to hear the feedback of anyone willing to send it. You deserve to know that your feedback is being read, that your issues are being considered by the design team, and that the chance of having your thoughts heard is not tied to your ability to be outspoken and persistent in a public forum. That is one thing all of our goals have in common, and one thing that we need to improve such that we are able to give players the input and feedback they deserve &#8211; the current &#8220;public&#8221; process.<br><br>To that end, we&#8217;re making a number of changes, both to the message boards and the procedures for sending feedback. First, you&#8217;ll notice that the Harpy&#8217;s Head and the Official Message Boards have been shut down. This is a temporary measure to allow people to time to read up on the new processes and rules in place prior to posting on official EverQuest forums. Some boards will be reopened in one-to-two weeks time under the new rules. <br><br>The Harpy&#8217;s Head boards will reopen under their existing rules (in-character), but will require an active EverQuest account to post. The Wishlist, the Newbie Zone, and the Customer Service/Technical Help forums will also reopen at the same time, but will have very strict guidelines concerning the type of content that is allowed in those forums. Other former forums, including the server and class forums, will not reopen.<br><br>Two new forums, &#8220;Developer&#8217;s Corner&#8221; and &#8220;Quality Assurance&#8221;, have been added. These forums will take the place of the former &#8220;General Discussion&#8221; and &#8220;Testing&#8221; forums. The difference here is that attempting to post a message or reply will take you to a special form where you can &#8220;Submit Comments&#8221; to the Development and Quality Assurance teams. Representatives from each team will read all of the comments submitted and choose several daily to which to reply publicly. Those representatives will then quote your comments if chosen in individual posts under the appropriate read-only forum. These forums will also be used for special announcements, inquiries, and the release of important information as it is appropriate. And we also hope it will be much easier for players to keep track of what is going on in EverQuest. <br><br>It is very important to us that we are able to address the needs of our customers. It&#8217;s not only important from the perspective of our goal of providing good service, but also for our primary goal: To be the number one online gaming company in the industry. Player feedback is so important to this process that we are taking these steps in order to gather feedback from more people more effectively. We are committed to responding not only to more issues, but also to more issues of concern and interest to a broader range of players. Finally, we are committed to giving our playerbase more input into what we do, and more insight into how and why we are doing it. <br><br>These changes are a sincere attempt to make all of that more possible. Please join us in ushering in a new age of communication and collaboration and visit the EverQuest Message Boards to submit your comments today.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</I></UL>Obviously this is big news and your free to comment on it on our <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5001">General Board</a>.  I'll have a new poll up later this evening for additional feedback.

New patch message went up this afternoon:<UL>March 28th, 1:30 pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>IMPORTANT NEW MESSAGE<br><br>***Combine Button Containers***<br><br>First of all thank you to everyone who posted the problem with the<br>Velious Tailoring recipes and other recipes that appeared to be broken<br>after the patch.<br><br>With the most recent patch, we fixed a bug that is causing some<br>confusion with these recipes.<br><br>There was a bug that allowed certain recipes to work in any container of<br>its type, where they were intended to work only in special containers of<br>that type. For example, there are recipes that were intended to only<br>work in the Coldain Tanner's Kit that could be completed in any Sewing<br>Kit. That bug was repaired along with some other minor bugs associated<br>with combine button containers in this last patch.<br><br>Please make sure that you are using the proper container as instructed<br>by in game instructions or npc's when combining trade skill components<br>or quest components in any combine button container.<br><br>The Velious Tailoring Recipes are currently functioning in the Coldain<br>Tanners Kit. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Ravno!
