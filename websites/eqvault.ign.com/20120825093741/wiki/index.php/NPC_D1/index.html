<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=NPC_D1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="NPC D1">edit</a>]</div><a name="Dabner_Drednever"></a><h3>Dabner Drednever</h3>
<p>Dabner Drednever is a cleric of Brell Serilis. He is a compassionate and simple man, light of heart and jovial in spirit. He does not share the intelligence of his close friend Ognit, nor the physical strength of his sworn protector, the barbarian woman Dagda. He is generally an air-head but this is off-set with a natural wisdom that shows itself in the form of the occasionally profound and significant insight. He is most comfortable in a nice cavern with some good solid earth over his head. As fate would have it, this is seldom possible. He takes this in great stride though. As long as he is with his friends, his inherent agoraphobic, gnomish nature usually does not bother him. 
</p><p>Dabner views Ognit as a role model. He wants to be more like Ognit but realizes that he lacks the intense schooling that Ognit has had. Indeed, he knows he is too old to pursue those things and he also knows that he lacks the mental acuity that Ognit possesses. He is comfortable in that knowledge, however. Dabner is the stereotypical side-kick to Ognit. He marvels at his ability to channel great magical energies in a most efficient manner (Ognit speaks often of efficiency). He will go along with just about anything that Ognit does and he trusts his judgement implicitly.
</p><p>Dabner has convinced Ognit to show him a bit of tinkering. The reason for this is both a means for him to be more like his role model Ognit, and also as a way to impress Dagda, upon whom he has a crush. Dabner is taken by Dagda's raw strength and physical prowess. She is his Knight in Shining Armor, in a manner of speaking. A word of encouragement from her ignites a spark within him that sets him aflame with unparalleled courage. Yet as much as he loves her, his nature prevents him from making even the slightest sort of statement of desire towards Dagda.
</p><p>In an odd way, a way that he does not acknowledge in a conscious manner, he views himself as solely responsible for the welfare of his companions. He has occasionally brought down the wrath of Brell upon a foe in order to call its attention upon him and to draw the enemy away from its target. This fact has garnered him great respect with Dagda and she does view the small gnome as one who is surprisingly brave for his size.
</p><p>Though Dabner is completely devoted to the worship of Brell, he also has studied, and is quite knowledgeable about, the religions of other cultures in Norrath, as well as the lore of the gods they worship. He finds that by studying and understanding the beliefs of others, they are not as scary to him.

<p>An evil sorcerer, he forged an enchanted blade that became cursed.
</p><p><i>From the Forbidden Scribe in West Cabilis</i>
</p><p>Long ago in the time of Emperor Ganak, Scholar Dag did walk with the Great Master Atrebe. After the unfortunate dusting of Atrebe did Dag begin his Study of the forbidden circles, Wizardry, Enchantry and Magic. It was soon that he took a liking to the ways of Wizardry.
</p><p>His studies were kept to himself as he ignored the laws of Kotiz. He became the Blasphemere of the Brood. Most of his studies were held in private, only his Sarnak slave named Kly was allowed to assist in his blasphemous studies. His secret was soon to be revealed to all.
</p><p>Dag was commissioned by Klum Machata to create a magical dagger for his personal use. It was to only be wielded by one of his ilk. Dag travelled to Kum’s outpost to begin his work. His slave went along, pulling behind him a special forge which belonged to Haggle Baron Dalnir.
</p><p>While Dag was away the Brood stumbled upon his journal and his secret obsession. The Brood sent word to Kum to have Dag deconstructed.
</p><p>Dag was in the final stage of enchantments, Kum let him proceed and when the dagger was complete, Kum shackled Dag and used the dagger upon the belly of Dag, the Blasphemere. 
The Dagger was found to be very effective, but lacked a few more spells and so it was returned to the Brood. It never made it back. The Crusaders sent, as well as the Sarnak slave who was pulling the Dalnir Forge, all vanished without a trace. Only the Dalnir Forge remained.
</p><p>Surely the gods cursed the blade by the hands of the Blasphemere. To avoid the wrath of the gods, all of Dag’s property and creations were burned as was the memory of his blasphemous studies.

<p>A barbarian warrior hero of Norrath.
</p><p>Dagda is a strong woman, firmly rooted in the physical world. She is most comfortable dealing with things she can touch, hear, and smell. A follower of The Tribunal, she believes in the tenants of absolute justice, but, for the most part, has little use for the gods. The realms of spirit and magic are best left to those who have the time to worry about such intangible things. The extent of her mystical experiences consist of a single dream she received from Tunare, though she never knew nor cared about its source, that foretold her meeting the gnomes, Ognit and Dabner. Other than this, she has found that obstacles are best met head-on where she can see them face to face, smell their breath, and hear the crunch of their bones. 
</p><p>Dagda saved the gnomes Ognit and Dabner in Everfrost many years ago when raiders attacked them. She has grown very fond of, and indeed loves, them both. She respects them for their inherent mystical and spiritual abilities, but she is keenly aware of their physical frailties. She vowed to defend them both, and does so with the ferocity of a bear defending her cubs.
</p><p>Dagda is by no means simple, and is truly a genius in the realm of tactics and combat. She is literate enough to read the common tongue with little difficulty, and speaks both the common tongue and her native tongue fluently. Her knowledge of other languages is generally limited to curses and taunts, of which she has gathered quite an arsenal. She generally communicates in a short and very direct fashion, leaving no room for misinterpretations.
</p><p>Dagda knows that Ognit is very intelligent and respects his knowledge, though she sometimes questions its use. She is most impressed and thoroughly fascinated by his ability to tinker and create wondrous things. Indeed, this is the medium through which she can relate to him best. The useful objects he builds allow her to perform any number of tasks, so useful, in fact, that she thinks he would be better off giving up the study of wizardry to become a full-time tinker. After all, it's just fine to call down the very fire of Fennin Ro upon the mighty Glacier Bear at 300 yards, but when it is mauling your head off it's of little use. 
</p><p>Dagda shares a healthy sibling-like rivalry with Ognit. Being an accomplished tactician, she is aware of the simple fact that at a distance Ognit would have the clear advantage, and would win were they to ever do battle. However, she also knows that if she got her hands upon him, she would be the victor. Despite being quick to anger at times--and she and Ognit have often exchanged heated words--Dagda would never raise a hand against either of the gnomes she has sworn to protect.
</p><p>Dagda views Dabner in a much different light. She has on countless occasions felt his healing touch as a cleric. For one who is so firmly rooted in the physical world, he is a very compassionate and loving soul. She loves him as a brother, and treats him in a somewhat patronizing manner. She would never consider speaking an unkind word to him, nor will she tolerate those that might. She is aware of, and also a bit saddened by, a crush Dabner has upon her. Dabner is simply too short for her tastes. She would much prefer a man of might with whom she would not worry. However, as a warrior she respects his raw courage in battle and his unfailing loyalty to his friends.
</p><p>Though she is closest to the gnomes, Dagda also shares a strong respect for her companions. It is Firiona Vie, Sir Jevik, and Thubr Axebringer she most deeply admires. They are all mighty warriors in her eyes. She acknowledges the skills of the rogue Dreezil Pocketdip, and views him as a skilled fighter. His ways of stealth are an effective way of dealing with his natural halfling handicaps in her eyes. Though she is not a warrior and not as skilled as the others with a sword, the bard Sionachie is a valuable asset to the group. Her rousing battle songs inspire a zeal that makes combat that much more exciting.
</p><p>For the wizard Al'Kabor, Dagda has little love. Respecting the immense power he wields, she has a healthy fear of him. After his recent threats against Ognit, however, her opinion of him has since plummeted.

<p>Ogre and Warlord, known as the destroyer of the five kingdoms.
</p><p><i>Of the Rakthokian Kingdom and General Dagnor:</i> 
For centuries while the elven empire grew to the east, the dwarves and ogres had thrived in the mountains to the west, surrounding the forest presently known as "Lesser Faydark." The dwarves settled into the jagged cliffs of what is known as the Butcherblock Mountains and there had established their golden kingdom of Kaladim, "The Forge of Norrath."
</p><p>The ogres were able to wrestle control of nearby lands from the orcan hordes of Faedwer after a decade of warfare and established the first ogreian kingdom in the nearby Rakthokian ridge mountain range, named after the first ogre leader "Rakthok the Warlord." There in the Faydark west the dwarves and ogres lived in an uneasy peace.
</p><p>While the immense empire of the elves could have easily crushed either one of the kingdoms, the ogres saw the dwarves as a primary concern. Raised in a culture where only the strength in your arms and the size of your weapon mattered, the ogres of the kingdom of Rakthok considered only the dwarves to be their equal and thus a very large threat. The ogres were also greedy of the gold-rich mountain mines and the stone cutting skill of the Kaladim kingdom, and to make matters worse, the friendly disposition of the dwarves did not agree with the savage and chaotic tendencies of the Rakthokian ogres. What resulted was an intense racial hatred and many small fights between the two kingdoms. 
</p><p>In the beginning of the second age, when the elven rebels against the god Innoruk began to surface, Dagnor the Butcher was chosen as the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian Kingdom. Clearly the most ambitious of all the previous Rakthokian kings, Dagnor was the first to realize that the small skurmishes between dwarves and ogres would never solve anything and that for the ogres to gain anything substantial, the dwarves would have to be completely overcome or slaughtered. He saw the mines of Kaladim as an infinite source of limitless wealth and power. Almost immediately after he seized the throne Dagnor began to assemble the largest combined army of ogres since the orcan clans had been overthrown.
</p><p>Dagnor was held in check for a long time, however, because Kaladim was a chief source of gold and weapons for the elven empire and the dwarves would find the elves a strong ally if war broke out. The ogre king was smart enough to realize that his kingdom could not survive an attack from both sides and so he did not advance and the dwarves did not regard him as much of a threat. While the indomitable elven empire loomed over western Faedwer, war was not an option for either the dwarves or the ogres. 
</p><p><i>Of the attacks on Northern Kaladim:</i> 
Dagnor is sometimes referred to as the destroyer of two empires. When he began his campaign against the dwarven kingdom of Kaladim he began the fall of his own kingdom of Rakthok, but also he stopped the dwarves from giving aid to the elven empire against the ever increasing elven rebel armies. Many historians surmise that if the dwarves had not been pulled into war with the ogres, their help would have caused the downfall of the rebel army and the old elven empire would still be in existence.
</p><p>In any case, with the war of the broken crown raging to the east, Dagnor knew the elves could not afford to lend aid to the dwarves and he took the opportunity to launch his own campaign against the kingdom of Kaladim. The warlord knew that the key to beating the dwarves was through the less guarded lands of northern area Kaladim where the dwarves had primarily established trading centers and peaceful mining villages. So in the middle of the second age, the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian kingdom marched his army of ogres and orcan slaves west across the hills of shade directly to northern Kaladim without fear of elven intervention.
</p><p>Old dwarves still tell the horrible tales of the first ogre attacks. Ill prepared to meet such an invasion force, the peaceful cities of northern Kaladim were swept over with tremendous speed. Ogre warriors burned everything they could put a torch to and killed every dwarf they saw be it man, woman, or child. In little less then a week the forces of Dagnor had surprised Kaladim and caused the deaths of hundreds of dwarves. The warlord had found the weakness in the impenetrable kingdom of Kaladim and now marched directly for the capital.
</p><p><i>Of King Grimmly Fireforge, and the Battle on the Hills of Shade:</i>
It was Dagnor's unnecessary need to stop and make sure everything was dead in the wake of his army that gave the time the dwarves needed to prepare. Word reached the capital city of Kaladim days before the ogres arrived. Hearing the startling news of the advancing army, the 12th dwarven King Grimmly Fireforge, an excellent fighter and brilliant military tactician, began to assemble a defensive force. Dagnor also did not anticipate the speed by which the dwarves could gather into a force large enough to repel his own. It was the warlord's first mistake.
</p><p>When the army of ogres reached the Crakthorn ridge, just one mile from the capital city of Kaladim, they were met by an equally large force of dwarves lead by King Grimmly. The fighting on the ridge was savage and brutal, but being less skilled at fighting in tight tunnels and with low light then the dwarves, the ogres were forced to flee. Dagnor ordered his army into the hills of shade where the dwarves and ogres could fight on equal ground.
</p><p>Day and night the battle raged across the hills of shade above the Lesser Faydark and the grass was bleached red with the blood of the fallen. Both armies were fueled by soldiers from their respective kingdoms and soon the war had ground into a stalemate
</p><p><i>Of the Orcan Betrayal and the Battle of the Shattered Spear:</i> 
Thinking that the war would either be won or lost on the hills of shade, Dagnor ordered his southern most forces guarding the forest of lesser Faydark to move north and add more strength to the army in the hills. He left instead a handful of ogre soldiers and mostly a host of orcan slaves. It was Dagnor's second and most fatal mistake.
</p><p>For the first time in history dwarves and orcs came to an agreement and entered in on an alliance. The dwarves promised the orcan slaves of the defeated orcan clans their freedom if they would not interfere in the war in favor of both sides. Completely in favor with the plan, which gave the orcs freedom but did not require them to fight, the orcan slaves retreated from lesser faydark to the east, deserting the armies of Dagnor and leaving the southern hills wide open. King Grimmly took this opportunity to assemble a second force to the south and then attacked Dagnor's army from both the front and the undefended flank. The ogre forces on the hills of shade were demolished. Dagnor fled with few others and the Rakthokian kingdom was now completely vulnerable. Grimmly gathered his remaining forces and headed straight for the ogre capital, leveling any fortresses he came to and burning Rakthok to the ground. The Rakthokian army had been broken.
</p><p>The last official battle took place beneath the forest of lesser Faydark as the remaining ogre forces, lead by Dagnor, attempted to flee to the south. They were met there by a small force of vengeful dwarven soldiers who were able to hold them off until the arrival of the main dwarven host. When King Grimmly and his army arrived, the forces of Dagnor fought viciously and were able to kill many, but were ultimately defeated. A story tells that Grimmly and Dagnor met eachother face to face on the shores of a lake to the south of lesser faydark during one of these fights, and that Grimmly stabbed Dagnor with a spear with such intensity and ferociousness that the weapon shattered into thousands of pieces even as it cut straight through the ogre lord's chest. The story goes on to say that the warlord fell to his death immediately in that same lake and that the evil in his blood made the water boil and turn red. Thus the dwarves mockingly renamed the lake Dagnor's Cauldron and thus the final battle of the ogre-dwarven war was called "the battle of the shattered spear."
