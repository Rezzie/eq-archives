Guide to Roleplaying by: Larian LeQuella 
</p><p>Having roleplayed for quite some time now in an online enviroment (starting with AOL's The Duel of Swords in 1994, and of course D&amp;D before that.)

Or you can get as grandiose as your creativity and personal time will allow.

In example, there are simply worlds of difference between the two examples below. 
</p><p>or 
</p><p>The basic differences between the given examples show two different depths of character. The original Grug doesn't know much about himself yet, but is more than willing to emote actions in the game as they pertain to other players. The second example shows Grug with a bit more internal character development and a fair idea of the emotions Grug would associate with the actions of attacking an enemy. 
</p><p>And both examples, are of course, right. There is no ONE way to roleplay. There is only guidelines that you can try to follow to try to ensure your being understood by those you are interacting with. 
</p><p>Good characters are the development of time and thought. A character I played for many years on AOL's The Duel of Swords (In a totally free form enviroment)was the development of years of roleplay and thought. Hes now an infamous legend in that community and is instantly recognized for who he is and what people can expect from him (usually havoc on a grand scale) when he comes around. And this is simply the by product of roleplaying him well and building a reputation as a very good duelist in the ring. 
</p><p>To really enjoy RP, or to enjoy someone elses RP, character development is the key. Anyone can cook up Ulrich the warrior. But it takes some thought to cook up Ulrich the table dancing, ale swilling, maidens of questionable virtue chasing barbarian. 
</p><p>So in conclusion, roleplay is what you make of it. Think of it as acting in text. And you've got the first part. 
</p><p><br />
</p><p><br />
Standard Character Development 
In a 3D world, your going to end up roleplaying the availible race/class combinations availible to you. Needless to say, freeform is a right and if you want to be a troll paladin...you are welcome to try it out. But don't be too terribly surprised if very few people are able to take you seriously. 
</p><p>Here are two combos that are pretty easy to roleplay from the start:
</p><p>Troll/Warrior-Berzerker: A simple preset here is a character thats not too bright, incredibly strong, with intense loyalty to other...smarter characters. 
</p><p>Erudite Wizard/Caster: Intelligent and scheming, always seeking to advance themselves and their power, erudian and effete. Physically weak but mentally strong. 
</p><p>As you can see, the race/class combonations availible in the game give a whole derth of availible presets to build a character from. Of course...if you feel you want to, you can play a troll thats a rocket scientist, or a high elf that's a total klutz. It truely depends on what you wish to develop yourself as. 
</p><p>The first thing you need to ask yourself is, who is your character? Where is he or she from? What propelled her into her line of work? Did he become a warrior to avenge the slaying of his family by the barbarians ala Conan? Is she a wizard because she has been romanced by the power of magic from a young age? Who are you...when you the "mun" (Mundane, meaning the boring person at the keyboard =) are playing a character? 
</p><p>A good way to start this in EverQuest is to take a look at the starting enviroment. Did you start in Ogguk? Are you the son of a peasant farmer from the Karanas or the fiery bastard child of a High Elf Lord and a wood elf? There are simply so many different enviromental cues that can help you begin your story as a character. 
</p><p>Another consideration is to ensure you'll be happy playing the class you've chosen. Breathing life into a character for several months can be a bit counterproductive and sometimes depressing if you decide you can't stomach the requirements of your class and have to delete and start over. 
</p><p>But to truly develop a character you must interact with other people. A story has no real depth until shared with and experienced by another person. The true test of character development is believability. If people look at you funny it's probably because you've over extended your character's actual believability. In freeform roleplay, you can be anything you want, but in a more structured enviroment like an MMORPG, you cannot be easily be known and accepted as demi-god if your a level 1 character that isn't very powerful. So in some ways, roleplay is dictated by the design of the game itself. 
</p><p>This is, of course, a bendable situation. If you play a character and develops it as your total focus you can achieve belief by consistency and diligence. 
</p><p>So focus on your believability. It's not often necessary to try to develop your character as the central figure of an epic saga (unless you just want to) either, because essentially EQ already has a very large dynamic story that never really ends. So it's easy enough to build your character around your deeds and actions within the realm your in, rather than building grandiose story lines involving storyline characters that do not exist. 
</p><p>Of course a rich storyline can involve creative elements beyond the game and alot of the best roleplayers do incorporate these issues. But once again you are wholly under the scrutiny of the players you interact with. 
</p><p>The biggest favor you can do for yourself is to know your character. Your character may react differently to situations than you would. He or she may have a complex system of morals you do not personally adhere to, or a total lack of them. <b>To know your character emotionally is the best way to be able to roleplay them effectively.</b> Let events affect them. Give them their own emotional and psychological scars that define who they are and where they are in the world and people will find interacting with your character to be a very satisfying experience that will encourage them to roleplay as well. 
</p><p>Common Chat Delineations
</p><p>Chat ensures that people know what and how you are communicating in game. There has to be a generally accepted symbol code that says what's in character, what's out of character, what is an action, and what is a thought. 
</p><p>To know how to properly react, you have to understand what is being said and how it's being presented. In our guild, we used a pretty simple system. 
</p><p>Any text not deliniated by a symbol of some sort was considered your character talking IN CHARACTER. Such as; 
</p><p>Guythus says, "Damn these barbarians, they've out flanked us again!" 
</p><p>That would be seen as an in character statement offerred up to the rest of the party or people in the general vicinity. 
</p><p>Text deliniated by parentheses or (( text )) was considered to be an OOC statement to pass information in game between "mundanes" as it was needed to (And usually as little as possible so as not to spoil immersion.) In example; 
</p><p>((Just a heads up all the Broncos just won the game tonight.)) 
</p><p>The OOC chat deliniation can help quickly pass information in chatgroups or group say with just the added effort of adding a double parentheses to each side of the statement.  This not only makes it easier for people to determine who they are talking to (the "mun" or the character) but it also does alot to help preserve the immersion aspect of a roleplay game. 
</p><p>Now in the Duel of Swords, to denote an action we've used a pair of colons: 
</p><p>...walks to the bar, settling against the old mahogany and looking over the gathered patronage.:: 
That is a text description of an action. As long as your in the same vicinity of the people you are interacting with, the /em or emote command works very well for describing non-model emote actions or thoughts. Of course, unless the people around you are mind readers (annoying) thoughts are just that, in your characters head, but shared via /em or chat action to liven up or deepen the roleplay experience. 
</p><p><br />
IC (In Character/OOC (Out of Character) and Blending
The hardest thing, of course, in a community that has so many different people from different gaming experiences is of course to be able to roleplay effectively. 
</p><p>In character interaction is simply that. In character. Nothing really transfers from one side of the game to the other with any reality except in extreme cases. 
</p><p>While in character you may completely and totally despise another character, this is not something that should in most cases transfer out of character. Once it does, it becomes BLENDING and it can be harmful to not only the principles involved but the community as well. 
</p><p>Blending IC and OOC in game can be confusing as well, and is often the mark of a new roleplayer or someone that isn't putting alot of effort into roleplay itself. Needless to say if you spend half your conversation talking in brogue and then suddenly explode in chat with LOLOLOLOLOLOL, that is disruptive to the roleplay experience. You may of course just be in your own way acting out your character laughing, but from a roleplay perspective, internet acronyms are not IC, and thusly tend to break the immersion. Consistently talking in character then switching to OOC real world events in a chat without an OOC delination is also blending and can cause confusion or annoyance to more seasoned roleplayers as well that are wishing to play their experience as IC as possible. 
</p><p>Blending can also become severely detrimental to the community when it is used in a fashion to attack characters because of your personal feelings about the mun behind them. Or vice versa. Which is why OOC and IC in game should always been clearly deliniated, so people can know what they wish to ignore, and what they wish to listen to.

Miscellaneous Information
In EQ on a roleplay server there will be many different types of players. But almost all have at least a light interest in roleplay. The idea is to respect everyone's point of view. And while this is a pretty tall order. It's most easily done when everyone uses and encourages a system of communication that is easily recognized and understandable between everyone on the server. A respect for hardcore roleplayers, and of course, those that only roleplay lightly and are on Nimue to play with friends, or escape the d00dz from other servers is of course necessary to allow everyone to fully enjoy the game in their own way. I hope that I've shared some useful information for anyone that might have had any questions and fully encourage any comments or additions to what I've written. 
</p><p><br />
</p><p><br />
Emotes Addition by Garwyn: 
</p><p>There are a variety of methods to breathe life into your character. A primary method is what the character says, but the "actions" of the character are just as important. These actions come in three classes in DAoC: 
</p><p>Core actions: Jump, sit, stand, draw weapon, sheath weapon, cast spells, run and walk. Use these in context-relevant ways. Careful use of walking can make your character more interesting. People notice a character that walks, because so few do. 
</p><p><br />
Game Defined Emotes: These are the emotes programmed into the game, such as /laugh, /beckon, /wave, /blush and /dance. Take note that the result for viewers of the "print" of your action is different based upon whether you have targetted someone or some thing. 
</p><p>Finally, there are user defined emotes. For roleplayers, this is the truly useful area of the game, having the flexibility of speech and the ability to be customized.
</p><p>The key rule, broken by many, is that actions are the expression of the objectively viewable actions of the character, not subjective expressions of the reason for the action. You should only do an emote that another person could "see" your character do. You can't see what people think, so the emote "Frank thinks this apple is tasty" or "Frank is dreaming of his home in Ardee" are improper. I can't count how many times players have emoted what their character is dreaming to my character. My character can't tell what your character is dreaming by looking at him. Just remember to make the actions objectively knowable, as opposed to subjective expressions. 
</p><p>More advanced emotes combine actions with speech. For example, you could "/em narrows his eyes and says suspiciously, "Have I seen you before?" Note that you do have to supply the quotes for the speech to let the reader understand what part is speech and what part is action. 
</p><p>As players become more advanced in their use emotes, they use them to "place" their character in the environment. It is one thing to have your character sit down next to a tree. But when you emote, that he or she is leaning up against that tree, casually pulling up grass and watching the wind carry it away, catching a ball and tossing it back to a child (requires a series of emotes to do well), then you are giving your character depth and putting him or her into the context of his environment. 
</p><p>The trick is to notice the details of the environment and use them for effect. My lil halfling would bow to others and then have to brush away the tall weeds that brushed his face as he did. (if you make a halfling bow, their face often ends in the tall grasses/flowers). I often like to pick out what is unique to the local scene and do an emote that uses that unique element. It makes the action interesting to others. 
</p><p>Don't be afraid to manipulate the environment, but do it within reason. If you are in a pub, pulling out a chair and sitting on it with a grunt is normal roleplaying. Be careful about trying to smash the chair on the ground into many pieces, as the other players cannot relate to the fact that they still see the undamaged chair in front of them. When manipulating the environment, keeping the manipulation temporary in your emote helps meet the problems with a non-dynamic environment (ie. we can't really move chairs around). 
</p><p>Unbelievable yet objective action emotes: Be very careful of making your character take an action that they plainly cannot do in the context of the gameworld. While having your character pour one vile of green liquid into a tall black cylinder and watching the smoke come out can't be actually done in the gameworld, it is believable. Having your character fly about the pub is pushing the limits of believability and is more often dismissed by other characters than believed. Having your character transform himself into a gorilla is so out of bounds that it makes the roleplaying more of a joke than an expression of creativity. 
</p><p>Finally, be careful of the objective actions you do that would logically make other characters act. There is a big difference between, "Frank hands Shiela a glass of elven wine" and "Frank hands Sheila a glass of elven wine which she quickly gulps down in one swig." Making other characters do actions involuntary almost never works out well. Let other's control their characters. Trying to force a response through an emote is bad manners and poor roleplaying. 
</p><p>Finally, as most roleplaying is interactive, using emotes to make players act in unison or in reaction to each other can be undertaken with great effect. I know that if I tickle Brelit, she will immediately giggle. We've worked together for so long as players, we know each other's emote responses. In fact, we know them so well we often do the same emote response to an third party's statement almost simultaneously. That combined effect makes the actions of the character appear more natural. If I offer a flask to someone with an emote, they then take it, open it, smell the whiskey inside, drink some, make a face (all with emotes) I can then be reacting to her actions with emotes. I can grin mischieviously or raise both eyebrows in expectation when she smells the whiskey. I can say something...I can snicker and slap my knee when she makes the face...etc. This is the essence of the emote interactions that make roleplaying fun. Combined with speech, most people enjoy roleplaying more due to the flexibility and variety it provides to social interactions.
