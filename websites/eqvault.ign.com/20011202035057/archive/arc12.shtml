The fine folks at PC.IGN have <a href="http://pc.ign.com/news/36743.html">published a report</a> detailing the big Velious Dragon Raids that took place last week.  The article includes several pictures tacked up along side the report as an added visual treat.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Shortly after heading out, we spotted our first prey, the red dragon Yeldema. As you can see from the images, this beast basically looks like Nagafen, and it didn't put up too much of a fight against our massive group of high level adventurers. Casualties were low, and we quickly dispatched the massive beast. Once it fell, Tubr looted the corpse, apparently finding the remains of his poor guide. The thirst for revenge was still great so we continued to search out another target.</UL>Check it out!

I noticed that Voodoo Extreme has slapped up a new installment of the <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/games/interviews/askbrad/2.html">Ask Brad column</a> this morning.  For those out of the loop, Brad "Aradune" McQuaid is the Executive Producer for EverQuest, Star Wars Galaxies and PlanetSide.  Here's a clip from the column:<UL><b>From: Spencer, How do you think the release of the latest two MMOGs (WW2 and AO) will reflect upon VI when say SWG or Planetside comes out? Are you going to be ready to handle the load or are we just going to get the typical PR about "We didn't expect so many people the first day"...We know it's a new genre and all but you can only use that answer for so long? Also what do you think of Funcom having 0 phone support?</b><br><br>Brad's reply: Well, I'm definitely not going to comment on our distinguished competition, especially not negatively. Nor will I promise that our future launches will be perfectly smooth. I do think, however, that since we've done this before and have a pretty good idea what's involved, how it scales, and already have a solid infrastructure and network topology, our chances are pretty darn good. <br><br>This stuffs not easy, folks. It's very hard to beta test and simulate the load of tens of thousands of players.</UL>To view the complete article please use the link provided in the above.

The single update to the Developer's Corner this evening dealt with spells, spells and more spells.  Here is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000246.html">the complete post</a> compiled by Alan with new information from Mr. Poe: <UL>Gramercy wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I applaud the spell Focus of Spirit. Good job on that one, it really helps Shaman out a lot. Three buffs in one, lasts a long time, good deal. <br><br>Only problem is, I cannot use it on myself, if I want to use Voice of the Berserker. They don't stack. VotB is level 59, so it's really only currently useful for one level. Once you hit 60, it becomes useless. <br><br>Before Focus existed, I could cast Talisman of Kragg, cast Maniacal Strength, and cast Mortal Deftness. If <edited for content> I wanted to cast Voice of the Berserker, I could just click off Mortal Deftness, and let VotB fly. Sure I couldn't use other spells for 20 seconds, but VotB is a very specialized spell. <br><br>The simple solution is to just let Focus of Spirit and Voice of the Berserker stack. The only downside I can say is that instead of 200 dexterity, the shaman will have close to 255 dexterity. Big deal. <br><br>Thanks for listening. ]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I've had a few shaman reminding me of this issue for a couple months, and I kept forgetting to get it corrected. I finally remembered this time (You can thank Nixx and Jenemdar), it should be corrected next patch. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This spell was aparently from all sources removed from play... as I understood it, it was simply the opposite of shrink and only useable outdoors. <br><br>Why remove it? <br><br>On the flip side why have it to begin with... <br><br>Positives: <br>Provides an aspect change that helps when fighting giants.<br>Provides entertainment when running thru the long Karana Plains.<br>Is in general a nifty little spell with little to no ballance issue I can see. <br><br>Negatives:<br>Costs money to purchase the spell or time to camp it if it's a dropped spell<br>Could make the EC tunnel more a pain in the bottom... <br><br>Maybe just a reason for us newbs as to why it was taken out would be great. <br><br>Frank D.<br>player of<br>Gerlac Obrennian<br>Thoulxe Paells ]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>The coding for this spell was never finished, as I've stated before.... I will try to get the spell in as soon as possible. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Keep in mind that the programmers and designers are all pretty busy here, and *soon* probably won't be tomorrow or the next day&#8230; as you say, it's a fun spell, not a critical issue. <br><br>-Alan <br><br>auriana wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: One of the things I would put in the category "Infuriating but Understandable" is the randomness of the invisibility spell. <br><br>I also understand that higher level characters should be able to see through invisibility. <br><br>But I do wonder what use Superior Camoflauge has. <br><br>Superior Camoflauge is supposed to be better than invisibility, yet in many of the places notorious for lower level, invis seeing MOBs (Sol A, Firona Vie) it is just as completely worthless as Invisibility. <br><br>In other words, i am having a hard time seeing where Superior Camo is really all that superior. <br><br>If I ruled the world, I would do one of two things: <br><br>1. Make Superior Camo more resistant to some of those lower level invis seeing mobs; or <br><br>2. Giving Superior Camo a solid minute where it is guaranteed not to drop, and then after that minute, make the duration random. <br>Thanks. ]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Superior Camo, like every other pre 50 invis spell, has a random expiration timer. This isn't going to change any time soon, as we introduced the Improved invis spells in Velious that do have a set duration. Superior Camouflage is Superior to normal Camouflage because it can be cast indoors. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>And keep in mind that there will be, and should be, strengths and weaknesses for each spell. The fact that the "invisibility" spells have a random duration until you reach at least 50th level is one of those weaknesses. It's strengths, well those are pretty obvious. <br><br>- Alan <br><br>-Mylo- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: SLN regens 2 points of health per tick, Natureskin regens 4 points... Protection of the Glades is supposed to regen 6 points of hp and 6 points of mana per tick, but it only regens mana. It is not regen'ing ANY HP. I've tested this numerous times :)]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Protection of the Glades does not have a regeneration component, it never has since Velious release. When the spell was put in it was decided to give it mana regeneration instead of hitpoint regeneration. I hope that clears it up for ya. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>As with the Growth spell question above, it's not uncommon for one rumor or another to grow to the point where it is assumed by some to be truth. It's important to keep that in mind. When you hear yourself saying things like "supposed to but doesn't", it might be a good idea to step back and figure out where you learned what it was supposed to do. <br><br>Or, you can ask us. :)<br>- Alan <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Can someone please take a look at the level 59 druid spell Legacy of Thorn. This is supposed to be a 28 point group damage shield. Yesterday, I casted it with my level 60 druid and it was only doing 24 points of damage. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Avendel <br><br>ps. I'm not entirely sure if this is my mistake or a bug so I submitted a comment under Testing also. ]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Thanks for pointing this out. The Cap was set incorrectly. I have fixed it, it will now be a 28 point damage shield. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>See what I said about asking? :)<br><br>- Alan <br><br>DenmonX wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Velium Chill of Al'Kabbor <br><br>PLEASE let us know if this spell is live or not, and throw us SOME kind of bone as to how to START the quest for it. PLEASE. At least, at the very least, let us know if it's live. ]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Velium Chill of Al'Kabor is not a player spell, any confusion caused by it are as a result of parsing the spdat, which I do not apologize for. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Draden042 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: In one of the recent patches (July 10?) a new lvl 4 Mage spell was added into SPDAT.EFF. By using a common parser tool (these are ok to use, right?) I and a few other mages noticed this addition. What I and many other mages were wondering is if this spell has been put into the game yet or was it just added to the .EFF? I don't expect to be told where it can be found but if at all possible, I'd like to save myself the multiple hours and porting fees that I would be spending to try and find a spell that doesn't exist. If ye kin also let us know what it summons exactly, it would be appreciated. ]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>This is not a player spell, see previous statement about parsing the spdat. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>And this is often the source of the rumors that we so often have to respond to. Parsing the spdat file is really not going to make your game play more enjoyable, folks. Play, have fun, and enjoy the game. Tearing apart game files and then worrying about what you find there isn't something that we encourage (ok, we actively discourage it). <br><br>- Alan <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: im a tad confued about something and HOPE you'll actually post a respoce to this, this time. <br><br>im a Warrior, i face all kinds of NPC's on any given day. i face spells, weapons, hand to hand, etc etc etc. well i got my hands on a weapon that procs a blinding spell (black blade of tormenting) when i face that weapon and the proc sticks to me i cant see anything other then my lag meter. when i USE the same weapon on a NPC and it sticks that NPC comes straight for me. how can it do this blind? ive seen many a caster suffer the same problem when useing a blind spell on a NPC aswell. <br><br>please, explain this? <br><br>Ayrilin Moonblade 55th Myrmichick [Riseing Ascension] - Povar ]</i></font><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>A blinding spell does not actually blind an NPC. What it can do is slow and confuse their movements. It can also lower their offensive melee capabilities. All this of course is dependant on the Resistance of the MOB. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------</UL>

This next announcement was brought to us by Orfle: <BLOCKQUOTE>There will be a guild leader meeting hosted on Tallon Zek Saturday the 28th of July for leaders of Good guilds.  The meeting will be held in North Kaladim at the Hall of Underfoot.  It will be hosted by Orfle Hailwich.  <br> <br>The purpose of this meeting is to help unite and organize the Light races on Tallon Zek.  Alas, the Dark force holds many zones and it gets harder and harder for Light races to obtain certain items.  There is hope though, in the Council of War.  An alliance consisting of all of the Light races of Norrath!  If you lead a Light guild, and would like more details, be sure and attend the meeting!<br> <br>Orfle Hailwich</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the heads up!

Vashanti informed me of a new site he created that is definitely worth a look:<BLOCKQUOTE>Just a little something I made up after goofing around in the kitchen area<br>of Skyshrine the other day.

It's<br>very dramatic, with play by play commentary, and has a cult following both<br>here and in Japan.

Alan talked about character alignment (ie, good and evil) issues on the Roleplaying Server this this afternoon in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html">only update made</a> thus far to the Developer's Corner:<UL>Luzaphur wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: In a comment by Telius he asked if good vs evil could be coded for the new server. In the response it was stated that the good vs evil code would exclude neutrals and you would end up with invicible healers. Why not just make neutrals attackable by both good AND evil. That solves the good vs evil problem and balances out the advantage of neutrals being able to group with everyone. <br><br>Just my opinion, thanks ]</i></font><br><br>That would fix it. But I think that would also change the original intentions of Telius' idea. <br><br>In any case, we're firm on this not being a PvP environment, so we can hold off on speculating about how such and environment might, or might not, work. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I like the idea of it being hard to learn the languages of your foes, however I think an interesting role playing opertunity is being missed. Bards are traditionally seen as people who are good at maaking themselves understood so maybe a song that allows them to be understood by people who don't speak there language would be possible? Or allowing them to learn languages with more ease? Or something along those lines. This would help a rather rare class be more usefull on the roleplaying server. <br><br>--- Lulidine<br>--- Bard of Bristlebane ]</i></font><br><br>That's an idea we've talked about too. It all comes down to how we decide to cover the rather vague concept of making languages harder to learn (item #3, I think). <br><br>But allowing bards to have it a little easier to learn languages is something we're thinking about. It might just be that they get more languages at their trainers (which I think they do now already), or if we use some sort of maximum points per day or level or whatever that bards will get a slightly higher cap. <br><br>Odds are that the advantage, if there is one, will be slim, though. <br><br>Cantatus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - Disable the option to show PC/NPC names on this server. It really doensn't make sense from RP terms that I would be omniscient enough to know people's names without asking (or targeting them). ]</i></font><br><br>You're right, it doesn't. But this is another one of those things that really has to be the way it is because without it the game becomes too inconvenient to play. Unfortunately it can often be hard to tell one person from another without those names. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - No common language? What happens to all the books written in common? Do they go to Human language? ]</i></font><br><br>Um&#8230; Er&#8230; <br><br>I dunno&#8230; <br><br>I'll have to look into that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - If druids in wolf form are reduced to barks, what are enchanters in elemental form supposed to do? :)]</i></font><br><br>Nothing&#8230; nothing at all. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - I'm still curious as to why only one character on this server? I'd much rather have the option of being able to roleplay many different type of characters and not be limited otherwise. And think of it, no twinking if you make a character with another alignment! ]</i></font><br><br>I feel exactly the same way. I make up new characters all the time. Unfortunately the overwhelming request from roleplayers was to reduce twinking. Making characters of different alignments wouldn't reduce twinking, since we have no plans of preventing trading between alignments (and, well, that's not how a lot of twinking is done anyway). <br><br>Also, there is a very strong argument for one character per server that has nothing at all to do with twinking. Identity. People with one character will identify with that character more. But more importantly, when playing on a one character server the actions of your only character will be linked to that one character. You build your reputation as you go and if you want to get rid of it, for whatever reason, you'll also have to get rid of the character. <br><br>The desire here is that people take more responsibility for their actions on a server that only allows one character. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - You know that little, tiny box people can write in for people to see when they are inspected? Any chance of enlarging this any? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, my thought was to remove it altogether (not that this is planned, we haven't talked about it at all yet). I have two reasons for this. The first is technical: It would allow people to bypass the language restrictions. <br><br>But the second is more compelling to me. <br><br>Tell people your story by playing with them. Weave your character's quirks and history into your life on Norrath. Don't just write out what your character is like into a little story and have people read it. Nobody that I know carries around a little sign explaining that his parents were mean to him and that's why he's so sullen all the time. <br><br>Play your character, don't turn him into a short story. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: My question is regarding the whole Good/Evil concept. This is probably going to fly in the face of everything that you are thinking, but I'm hoping that this has some merits. <br><br>In one of the posts it was noted that determination of alignment is, probably, going to be based on the "race, class, deity" combination. Here are my questions... <br><br>1. Is it fair to assume that all members of a race are Good or Neutral or Evil? ]</i></font><br><br>Well, that discussion came up in the office. I think the example was dark elven worshippers of Bristlebane. Some were of the opinion that all dark elves would be evil, regardless, and that such worshippers of Bristlebane worshipped a more spiteful, nasty, mean sort of prankster than the side of Bristlebane that nicer folks like Halflings worship. These would be 'evil' dark elves, despite their worship of a god that generally isn't considered evil. Others felt that such dark elves were worshipping Bristlebane as much because he is the god of thieves as because they were purposefully rebelling from the general Hatred of their people, and are therefore 'neutral' dark elves. <br><br>Both sides are, of course, right. Either could be the case. As the game designers and world creators, it might become necessary that we decide that one side is right and one is wrong. It we have to assign an alignment to dark elven rogues that worship Bristlebane, then we'll have to set that in stone. And that will be that. In much the same way that we've decided that Barbarians are tall and lizard people are called iksar and that some gnomes have green hair. <br><br>There are other races that could easily be given many alignments, humans being the most obvious. <br><br>So the answer would have to be, no, it's not fair to assume that all members of a given race are similarly aligned. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. Could not somebody who is "Evil," such as a Dark Elf, not change his views and decide that he's on the wrong side? ]</i></font><br><br>Of course he could. I'll leave out the whole argument about dark elves exterminating themselves when a whole generation turns 'good' on a whim&#8230; :)  But certainly individuals could make that choice. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. If a character works hard to increase his faction with an opposing race, such as a Dark Elf who kills hundreds of orcs so he can safely travel among the Wood Elves, isn't he considered to be "Good" by the Wood Elves, since he has fought for a goal they approve of, while his own people may hold him in disfavor for killing their allies? ]</i></font><br><br>Possibly. I'm more inclined to think that the Wood Elves see him as tolerable, not good. There's a very fine line there, but one that is important to me (I argued on the side that see dark elves that worship Bristlebane as evil, by the way). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. And is it reasonable for a character to have a change in "faith" and decide that his/her god is not the one to follow, that perhaps another religion is the "true" path? I imagine that the formerly worshipped god is going to be upset by this conversion, but it could happen. ]</i></font><br><br>Sure, that's reasonable. Again, though, I'm going to have to mention that there is a tendency in an open system for too many people to want to play the rebel. Allowing people to make their high elves into worshippers of Bertox might very likely cause a plague of such high elves to appear, changing the whole society to evil overnight. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Fantasy literature is filled with characters who go from Good to Evil or Evil to Good. This is done via actions taken, changes of heart, association with others. Is there any way this could be done in-game? ]</i></font><br><br>There are a few ways it could be done in game. But I'm not a fan of the idea, for reasons I think I've give a little too much time to in this thread. :)  And you also have to keep in mind that everything we come up with has to be programmed, and resource use is always going to be a consideration. The more complex, the more resources needed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Here are a few suggestions: <br><br>1. See if there is a way to use faction in the determination of alignment. (i.e. higher overall faction with the "Good" races than the "Evil" races has the character leaning toward "Good.") ]</i></font><br><br>Yes and no. I've seen a lot of ideas about how to do this. But factions are pretty much group related (you can gain and lose faction with one group of 'good' people, but that won't affect how all good people see you). We probably could do something like add up a bunch of faction numbers and weight them for degree of good or evil then total the numbers up and come up with some sort of degree of good and/or evil. But, well, would that really reflect on the character's alignment? <br><br>It might. But that's a lot of resources (process-wise and people-wise) for a system that would be designed pretty much for those that want to create the rebel dark elf or good ogre. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. Provide a way, perhaps via a quest, to begin worshipping another god. Maybe you have to get your faction up high enough to enter the primary temple to that god and then talk to the high priest or perform a ceremony at an alter or something. This would, of course, not be an option for a Cleric, Paladin, or Shadow Knight, as they derive their powers directly from their god. The change in which god is followed should also incur a rather serious negative faction hit with the followers and related factions of the original god, but no increase with the followers or related factions of the new god. This means that changing gods may change your alignment, but it won't make you more popular. You have to do that on your own. ]</i></font><br><br>This is probably also possible (remember, I'm not a programmer, and I don't play one on these boards). My thought would be that any such quest would have to be of 'epic' proportion. Changing your god would have to be a trial, or too many people would do it. <br><br>And, well, I can't picture allowing a dark elf to worship Tunare. Or an Iksar to worship Quellious&#8230; In the world of Norrath the gods given to you when you create the character really seem to me to be the only gods you should be able to switch to with a quest like this. I know there will be arguments against that, and I think we've talked about them before. <br><br>This is more of a philosophical issue for some. But the gameplay problems are pretty big too. Rangers that worship Innoruuk are not going to be able to find training. And, well, we're talking about a lot of quests here, even if we find some way to make it only one quest per god. These would be long and complicated quests (if not, I certainly wouldn't be happy with them&#8230;), and such quests take a lot of time to create. <br><br>Let us discuss this internally a bit and I'll get back to you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. Keep part of the alignment based on race. There are going to be certain preconceptions that everyone has (all High Elves are Good, all Dark Elves are evil). This must have some basis in truth. Perhaps Dark Elves are predisposed towards Evil and High Elves toward Good. ]</i></font><br><br>Right. That makes sense. If alignment is based on something like race, class and deity, then race would always play a part. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. Keep class as part of the alignment calculation. Necromancers, no matter how noble, deal with dark arts and are not generally nice people. If you choose a certain discipline then you are implying a certain agreement with the principles of that class. ]</i></font><br><br>Also agreed. Keep in mind here, though, that right now we're just talking ideas. I don't really know how possible all this is yet. Our programmers are busy, and in-depth talks about this will be delayed a bit. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I guess this has gone on long enough. In summary, is there going to be a way to change alignment, even if it doesn't encompass what I've written above? I'm something of a romantic and the idea of an "Evil" person who sees the light, as well as the pure hearted person who falls from grace, seem very role playish to me. <br><br>Thank you for your time. <br><br>Steve Abbott<br>Jarrod of Bristlebane ]</i></font><br><br>The answer is, I don't know yet. <br><br>Personally, I don't think the idea of letting evil people see the light will work under the influence of real people playing the game. But we haven't ruled it out yet. First we'll have to decide how alignment will work, then we can talk about how to change it. :)<br><br>Ancalgon_of_Drinal wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just a thought / question about the RP server. (BTW I love the idea and am very much looking forward to it) <br><br>Since it will be set up along Good vs. Evil lines, are the factions going to be rearranged a little, so an Iksar (Evil team) can make use of the Dark Elf City (also Evil team)? <br><br>Thanks<br>Ancalagon Alag`Zi<br>Iksar Warrior ]</i></font><br><br>First, I really don't think it's a good idea to look at this server as any type of team server. While we intend to put restrictions on the interactions of goods and evils, looking at it as a team server puts the wrong sort of emphasis on the whole project. <br><br>No, we're not likely to change the basic factions on this server (or any other, for that matter). The fact that trolls don't trust iksar is, well, fact. Nothing about this server will change that. <br><br>drf wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: One request I would like to make would be that agnostic would be kept for a deity for those classes who have the option of agnostic. I roleplay my DE wizard as "good", only evil part about him is the fact that he is a dark elf. Worshipping Innoruuk would make this, from a roleplaying perspective silly. ]</i></font><br><br>I don't believe that we have any plans to remove agnostic as an option on this server. <br><br>_junior wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Funny that you should mention paladins and speaking teir'dal. The thing is, spoiler sites aside, there is at least one fairly low level paladin quest that requires being able to read Teir'Dal (falchion of Koada'Vie, I believe) in order to discover where the final mob spawns.<br>I'm all for making languages a little more difficult, but I also expect there will be some interesting repercussions on some of the cleverer quests out there. ]</i></font><br><br>No doubt. There will most likely be a lot of things that end up rather funky if we add in all these changes. With a game this complex that has been built up step by step over years, there will be plenty of things that end up sorta goofy after making some basic structure changes like those we're proposing. <br><br>We'll try to catch them as they come up. In this case, either I'm wrong about how paladin guild masters think about dark languages, or the quest will have to be changed&#8230; :)<br><br>Or perhaps only a very enterprising paladin will ever complete the quest. <br><br>Alan</UL>

I've got several comments from Lawrence Poe for you all today. <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Hey guys, sorry for the lack of responses lately. I've been hard at work on the Luclin spells, and haven't had much time to go through the Dev Corner emails. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Filan_tribunal wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: im wondering will PotG and Barrier of force ever stack i find it rather silly that a rune and a HP buff dont stack seeing that barrier is the effect of an epic weapon which would be far more powerfull then a normal casted spell. ]</i></font> <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I've corrected the issue in the spdat, these two effects should stack next patch. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Sootbeard wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Last night as I sat in Dreadlands meditating, a kind enchanter cast Clarity II and Gift of Brilliance on me, and I in return cast Spirit of the Wolf on him. When I got to my choice of hunting grounds, I attempted to cast Form of the Howler on myself and I just kept getting the "your spell did not take hold" message. I could not cast Form of the Howler while I had the spell Gift of Brilliance on. As soon as that spell wore off, I was able to cast Form of the Howler. Please look into the stacking issue on these spells. ]</i></font> <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Both of these spells share a mana regen component in the same effect slot.

I was so excited! <br><br>What could it be? The mighty Smite spell! For CLR and ENC, so I quickly bought one and tried to scribe it. Yes, I received the message, "Must be level 61 to scribe", hehe can't wait. <br><br>P.S. Some doubting cleric claimed it was a 14 lev spell, DOH nerfed already.

I was looking through spells and when I got to the merchant Rizyra F'Lok she had a spell on her that caught my attention when I noticed it was a level 61 Shadow Knight spell Augment Death, is somewhat distressing seeing level 61 spells when can never reach level 61.

If you have a buff on that shares components of a negative spell, the negative spell will overwrite the buff.

It seems that after wednesday's patch, it is possible to stack Form of the Howler, Form of the Hunter, and Spirit of Oak. From that point, you can cancel spirit of oak and keep all the benefits of Form of the Howler and Form of the Hunter without wolf illusion and the negative and positive faction (mostly negative) that come with it. Please either say this is ok or not intended. ]</i></font> <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>This was a bug that we introduced a couple of patches ago, it should be corrected now. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Any chance there will be solo teleports (gates) to points in Velious other than the Iceclad Ocean?

It's becoming so tedious to buff everyone on raids at 60. <br><br>Something like "Gift of the Phantasmist". A group spell that would wrap up Gift of Pure Thought, Enlightenment, and possibly Gift of Brilliance. <br><br>Although you can consider leaving out Gift of Brilliance if you insist on keeping the mana cost at 450. Talk about an broken spell. Four hundred and fifty mana! for a spell that adds 150 mana to your mana pool, and *BARELY* increases mana regen.

I tested it to be sure. I even tested it with a level 9 cleric attempting to cancel a Clinging Darkness from a level 6 necro.

This is annoying, to be sure. :)<br><br>My question is, is there any way you can put in a command to identify your character's bind point? Even if it just specifies the zone, it would be very helpful.]</i></font> <br><br>We recently (well, a few months ago&#8230; maybe last year&#8230; I don't remember&#8230;) added a command that will tell you your bind point. It's /charinfo. <br><br>I've used it a few times since it went in.

Math is below. <br><br>You are level 45 <br><br>1 level 60 kill = 100 + 15*2 = 130 points + 10 points for a greater insignia = 140 <br>1 level 20 kill = 100 + (-25)*2 = 50 points <br><br>So at level 45 you get more exp from taking out a 3 man group of level 20's than you do from one level 60. ]</i></font><br><br>That's true, he would get 20 more points. But no insignia and no cash. <br><br>I wonder if that group of 3 20 levels would be harder to kill? I'd be willing to bet that at least one of them gets away&#8230; <br><br>Keep in mind that we are not storing points, we're storing data that we use to calculate the points. So if we decide to change the point ratio we can do so at any time. <br><br>Gawain_the_Stout wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Has it been announced yet exactly what the rewards for turning in insignia might be? <br><br>And other than the prestige involved with being a top-rated PK'er for your team, what other advantage would there be to holding on to insignia? ]</i></font><br><br>We haven't announced the rewards. I'm not entirely sure that we will announce them. But we'll let you know when they go in. <br><br>Yes, boosting your point total will probably be the only reason to keep them. <br><br>Talez wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello, <br><br>Was just wondering where one can see the list of players and how many points they have. Ive looked on the www.everquest.com website but couldnt find anything relevant. Am i just overlooking something? ]</i></font><br><br>Nope, you haven't overlooked it. It's not up yet. I'll let you all know when it's ready. <br><br>Korgarl asked: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Questions:<br><br>1. Do you have to strike the killing blow to be awarded the insignia? ]</i></font><br><br>Yes. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. If 1 is yes how will the support classes benefit from this rule change (i.e. Shaman, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter)? ]</i></font><br><br>They won't. The support classes are just that, support classes. But don't kid yourself, I've been toasted several times on Sullon by clerics and shaman&#8230; <br><br>The game system pretty much only supports the current method. Player characters don't work the same as NPCs, and the killing blow is really the only way to accredit a kill against a PC. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. As the server matures this system will favor melee classes. Once this happens how will you overcome the stagnation due to specialization, when more people start to play melee classes? ]</i></font><br><br>I don't see that as a problem. If support classes become rare due to the urge to get the killing blow becoming prominent, then those that do play support classes will become the most desired players on the server. Remember, you still have to go out and kill NPCs to earn experience. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. I am interested in a PvP server that would incorporate role-play as an integral part. This was the closest you had until this change. What do you say to the people looking to role-play and have their day ruined by some corpse campers with nothing better to do than aquire points? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, on this server the fact that you can be a hostage to your corpse is part of the roleplaying. Your body is valuable, of course your enemies will consider guarding it. As a roleplayer, you shouldn't be thinking about the points. They are external to the game world and will never be shown in game. Ignore them and look at the actions of your enemy. They fit very well into the setting that is Sullon Zek. It's kind of a trick to play on those that don't roleplay. On this server, they are roleplaying when they jump you for being a goodie or for not following the ways of Bristlebane or whatever. The violence is inherent in the system. It's part of the game world. And therefore it is part of roleplaying in that world. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5. What if you made the insignias a part of a major deity specific "epic" quest for each class? Turn in the insignia for positive faction with you deity and negative faction with the deity of the slain player. Make this the only way you can get enough faction to get this "epic" item. At least then that player can claim he is a champion of his deity and has been rewared for his actions for the "cause". ]</i></font><br><br>Hmmm&#8230;. <br><br>:)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 6.

The Developer's Corner only saw one update from Alan today.  The subject of that one update is the RP server:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html"><b>Roleplaying Server</b></a><br>Telius wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Excuse me if this has already been asked...but i'm just wondering if you'll make it free to move characters unto this RP server from other servers.<br>Sounds like you're not too sure if this will be a success so i figured free transfers at least for a period of time or something could help growth of population.<br>Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, one of the few things that I am sure about for this server right now is that we will not be transferring character to it from other servers. Servers with special rulesets are usually harder, both for leveling and item acquisition. Moving characters to special servers like this from other servers isn't a fair thing to do. <br><br>Nope, if you want to play on this one, yer gonna have to start over. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a few questions. I'll be brief and to the point. <br><br>1-GvE...Good vs. Evil. How tough would it be to implement code allowing good and evil characters to automatically be on hostile terms with one-another and be capable of fighting each other without submitting a duel? Dunno how to work neutrals into this, but thats why you guys are paid the big bucks. :)]</i></font><br><br>Probably possible. We could code PvP to be active between good and evil. But we can't do that and exclude neutrals. Then you have invulnerable healers in a PvP game, something we're not real fond of. And, well, we've pretty much decided that this will be a non-PvP server. When this one becomes a huge hit, then you can pester us for a version of a PvP roleplaying server&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2-Comprehend Languages...What about a new spell, with a very brief duration, that allows casters to understand all languages? This could help them to clear up confusion, and help enchanters and rogues pose as members of a different race, if they so choose. Maybe this could even help a character increase her understanding (skill level) of a language. ]</i></font><br><br>Interesting idea. Though I have no idea how a rogue would be casting this spell&#8230; <br><br>I would be against it improving language skills, since it actually would be contrary to learning the skill, you'd be magically bypassing the language altogether. But it's an interesting spell idea. I'll add it to the list of idears. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3-What about making formerly no drop quest items (items you would turn in to be rewarded another item) drop regardless of the level of the character vs. the mob? The prevent farming, could you implement code that would prevent any one character from performing the same quest more than once? ie...label the character with code which keeps them from doing the Totemic Breastplate quest twice. ]</i></font><br><br>This gets into very complicated territory. We really don't want to have to look over every quest in the game to evaluate them for such a restriction (some quests are perfectly ok to do more than once), and we're not looking to rewrite a whole bunch of game code here. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4-As for finding groups in large zones, thats what feet are for. I run almost everywhere. I can probably count the number of times I have bought a port on one hand (of course, as a shammy, I get great movement spells). What I am saying is, if you want a group in the Sarnak Fortress in Ill Omen, RUN to the Sarnak Fortress and look for a group there. Don't stand at 4p and just shout LFG! ]</i></font><br><br>I actually find that if you stand in front of someone and ask them if they need your help in their efforts against their foes, they are usually more receptive as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5-Add my vote to those who WANT certain items to be more rare. ]</i></font><br><br>ok. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 6-I'd like to see racial arms and armor nerfed a little. Northman Imbued Armor is really sad compared to, say, High Elven Mitrhil Plate Armor. And both pale in comparison to Ry'gorr. A character must be in his 30s to forge Northman Imbued, but by that time, he definitely won't want to wear it himself. And he'll be lucky if he can sell it for what it cost him to make it. People who work hard on their trade skills should be rewarded for it. Not forced to catch up with their friends whom have all moved on to tougher mobs and better loot (and thus, better armor than what you can make for yourself as a smith). ]</i></font><br><br>It sounds like your calling for an improvement to racial armor, not a nerf&#8230; And, while an interesting concern that I'll pass on, it's not something that directly relates to a roleplaying server ruleset. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 7-I like the thought of druids in wolf form having to bark. :)]</i></font><br><br>I remember this from playing first edition D&D. I had a character that could change into the three allowable druid shapes (though he weren't a druid&#8230; those were the good ol' days). Since he could only turn into each type (avian, mammal, and reptile) once a day, he was very reluctant to leave a form once he took it. But he couldn't communicate at all as a bird or a panther (except to some that he had some pre-set signals arranged with). I spent many an adventure not saying anything except to growl when people got to close&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Thanks for taking the time to get our input on this, and, as always, thanx for the hard work. We really do appreciate it. :)<br><br>~Agdi Spiritforge,<br>Prexus Server ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the input.

The ppl out of the range only see the emote "Gysen mumbles something under her breath" That way my group can converse without group chat, but someone eavesdropping could as well...more roleplayish, if you will.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
A brand new load of <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000242.html">questions were answered</a> by Brad McQuaid in an update last night on the Developer's Corner.  Check it all out here:<UL>Brad, <br><br>I've stared at this post for 5 minutes trying to weed out my question. Here's hoping I picked a good one :)<br><br>During the development of a product like EverQuest, at what point is there no turning back? Technology speaking. How far into the design and implementation can you allow for inclusion of new technology prior to release? Like graphics(software) and servers(hardware). <br><br>Gina and Jacob Olson <br><br><b>Brad McQuaid: Well, the good news is that with MMOGs, there&#8217;s really never a time when you can&#8217;t include new technology. The client software is always patchable, data on the server side can be updated, and even server hardware can be replaced. And we&#8217;ve done all three with EverQuest in the last couple of years. Not only have we updated the client&#8217;s engine, we&#8217;ve also started using newer versions of Direct X. The server-side data is updated almost every patch with new content. And the server-side hardware has been upgraded many times &#8211; we&#8217;ve added more memory, faster CPUs, and faster hard drives as technology has advanced. </b><br><br>------ <br><br>Hi Brad, <br><br>I was a beta player and am still a big fan of the game (EQ) after all this time. One of the things you did when you created the game was to say that all the servers would be maintained by Sony/Verant rather than like what ID had been doing with QUAKE, where anyone could set up a Quake server. There would be no private "World Servers" in EQ. <br><br>I guess my question is: Is this the model you are following for all future games currently planned? Will you be setting up a Neverwinter Nights style game eventually where players generate the content for one another? <br><br>Guess we players are all just frustrated Game designers at heart. <br><br>-Archanalia <br><br><b>Personally I think there&#8217;s a big future for both traditional MMOGs as well as &#8216;Neverwinter Nights&#8217; style games. They&#8217;re both very different, afterall. <br><br>We&#8217;ve no plans on making EverQuest such that the public could maintain servers for two reasons: <br><br>1. It&#8217;s not the economic model we&#8217;ve designed both the game and its support structure for. <br><br>2. One EQ world takes something like 20+ high-end dual processor machines with tons of memory to run, not to mention gobs of bandwidth. So we simply don&#8217;t think it would be very practical for people outside of our business to run. <br><br>That said, while EQ, Star Wars: Galaxies, Planetside, and Sovereign are all being designed as premium subscription based MMOGs, I wouldn&#8217;t rule out an SOE/Verant &#8216;Neverwinter Nights&#8217; style game one day. I can&#8217;t wait to play the game myself, as well as to discover the potential of user-generated content. </b><br><br>------ <br><br>Brad, <br><br>Ok, so Verant likes grouping... But, they apparently don't like multi-group raids... Why isn't there a 'raid channel (or channels)' for each zone? <br><br>A lot of people aren't in guilds, and a lot of guilds get allies to raid - why not fix this 'design flaw' so you can accommodate us? <br><br>(granted, 'design flaw' is not the most appropriate word, but it fits my feelings on this...) <br><br>Thanks :)<br><br>Jason Wallace <br><br><b>You&#8217;re right: we need to better accommodate multi-group raids. We definitely have lots of content in the game designed for raids, and we love the fact that the game can handle massive battles. But it wasn&#8217;t always that way, which can help explain why we don&#8217;t currently have any features to support groups with more than six members. <br><br>Way back when we were designing the game we were very worried about how many players we&#8217;d be able to display on the screen at once. This was back when we were developing a software render and using Pentium 133s to develop the client. In the text MUDs we&#8217;d played, groups could be huge (sometimes there&#8217;d be between twenty and thirty people all attacking a dragon). But we were worried about framerate, and what might happen if a bunch of players appeared on the screen at once. <br><br>Single player games didn&#8217;t really have such concerns because their developers could always control how many players and NPCs could appear on the screen at once &#8211; they could budget for a maximum. But we couldn&#8217;t stop an army of players from assembling (nor did we really want to). <br><br>So we designed the game for a maximum group size of six, made some character optimizations (for example, dynamic level of detail on character models), and hoped for the best. <br><br>Turns out, over time, technology has advanced such that we can display many more players than ever we&#8217;d hoped. Not only that, bandwidth optimizations have been made as well. So we&#8217;ve been putting in raid content for some time, but I agree with you &#8211; it&#8217;s time to put in additional support and features for larger group communications, experience splitting, etc. <br><br>I don&#8217;t have a time frame for you, but I hope it will happen by Luclin or soon after. </b><br><br>--------- <br><br>Brad, <br><br>Cool idea by the way (referring to Ask Brad). <br><br>My question is about the effect "pulling" has had on the game and if it's not what you originally had in mind when the game play was being designed. Would/will you design your next games to be Pull proof? <br><br>I have read on the boards from time to time, that Verant was disappointed when certain situations were being single pulled because your intent was for those to be multi mob encounters. I play a Monk and in my 59.4 levels I have pulled A LOT of mobs. I have abilities that make it easy in most cases to pull a single back for processing. <br><br>I have follow up questions that ride on your answer being that pulling is not what you originally intended, especially FD splitting. What was your intent was with FD if it wasn&#8217;t pulling? Will you include similar ability in future ventures? <br><br>Observation from me as a player: It doesn&#8217;t work in a fight if other players are still hitting said mob, so, it only seems to be useful for pulling and CR. <br><br>Thank you for reading along, <br><br>Paul Carter <br><br><b>Well, yes and no. The original intent of the game certainly did not include &#8216;pulling&#8217;. We rarely pulled when we were playing text MUDs; rather, we&#8217;d fight room to room, adventuring through a dungeon or towards a specific goal. <br><br>But, obviously, 3D graphical MUDs like EverQuest aren&#8217;t room based (in other words, there&#8217;s no clear delineation between rooms like most text MUDs have). One of the several results of this evolution from text to graphics was &#8216;pulling&#8217;. <br><br>From a design standpoint, pulling is a bit frustrating because it&#8217;s much harder to set up an encounter with multiple NPCs that you desire to fight the player (or group of players) all at once. Pulling allows one to separate groups of NPCs, singling them out, making them easier to kill. <br><br>All that said, we did realize these ramifications early in beta and started adapting the game accordingly. Spells and other strategies were put into the game to support and actually help players pull, and the game designers started laying out dungeons and other adventure areas accordingly. <br><br>In the future, I&#8217;d love to experiment further and try to recapture more of the multi-NPC battles we experienced in text MUDs. But EverQuest is and will remain a game where &#8216;pulling&#8217; is a valid and recognized tactic. <br><br>Oh, and Feign Death was originally designed to be merely a feature that would save a Monk should a battle go rather badly. It was an ability we gave that class to make up for their lower Armor Class. </b><br><br>------- <br><br>You are discussing a lot of ideas with the player base that undoubtedly your competition is reading also. What are your thoughts on this? Giving the competition a bit of a glimpse to the internal thinking at SOE/Verant and potentially giving them ideas. Or worse yet seeing them make an idea you discarded work very well. <br><br>Tanstaafl Fyreweaver [Horizons]<br>Innoruuk <br><br><b>When it comes to competition and ideas, there are two extremes, and I like to think we&#8217;re somewhere in the middle. One extreme is to carefully hide all ideas and technology until the very last minute, lest some other company use an idea in their product or be influenced in some positive way. The other extreme is to talk about everything and have no secrets. <br><br>I think we&#8217;re early enough in the evolution of MMOGs that it helps all those involved to share ideas to some extent. To that end, we&#8217;re a pretty open and friendly group of developers. Most people involved in making these games know each other, hang out with each other at GDCs and E3s, participate in email lists and message boards, sharing ideas and dreams. <br><br>That said, you won&#8217;t read some ideas of ours in detail in this column or elsewhere. We do have some pretty nifty plans and schemes we think should remain private until such time they can be implemented. <br><br>It&#8217;s really all about balance. Will our competition glean something from my posts here that will help them? Well, that&#8217;s very flattering, and if they do, so be it. I know we look at their products and posts, trying to learn what to do and what not to do. It&#8217;s only fair that they do the same. </b><br>----------- <br><br>Brad, <br><br>Are there any plans to have books written that take place in the world of Norrath, perhaps telling the exploits of Firona Vie, Lanys T'vyl or other noteworth folk? Maybe giving more detail about things that have happened, like Bloody Kithicor? I think it would be great, and a nice way to carry a little EverQuest with us when we can't be near our PC. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Kendall <br><br><b>We&#8217;d love to have novels written about Norrath and its inhabitants. I can&#8217;t say much more right now, but we ARE currently talking to publishers and writers. </b><br><br>---------- <br><br>Brad who the heck are you any way? <br><br>R. Thomas <br><br><b>I&#8217;m Brad McQuaid, currently the Vice President of Premium Games for Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive. <br><br>John Smedley hired Steve Clover and me in March, 1996 to work on a massively multiplayer RPG. Initially I was the lead programmer, but after a few months became EverQuest&#8217;s Producer (the Producer being the person who manages and leads the development team, which typically consists of programmers, artists, and designers). <br><br>Steve and I were also the game&#8217;s original designers, and architects of the original Design Document. We came up with the core design (modeled heavily on MUD principles) and a rough outline of Norrath. Bill Trost later came on board and became the official lead designer, filling in most of Norrath&#8217;s detail and background history, and also replacing our initial alignment system with a much more intricate faction system. <br><br>I also did a lot of the PR for EverQuest early on, because 989 was focused more on Playstation titles at the time. <br><br>After Verant Interactive spun off of 989 Studios, John Smedley became president of that company and I became Vice President. We took on more projects and I moved from a direct management role into more of an Executive Producer (Jeff Butler replaced me as EverQuest&#8217;s Producer and he took over the Live/Expansions teams). <br><br>And finally, when Sony Online Entertainment bought Verant Interactive, I became one of several Vice Presidents, but remained managing our Premium subscription based games. Currently I&#8217;m the Executive Producer on EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, as well as some other unannounced titles. I also oversee, albeit at a higher level, the Star Wars: Galaxies project, with Rich Vogel, Director of Development, running the project. I&#8217;ve also been involved in the design process behind Planetside and Sovereign. </b><br><br>--------- <br><br>Brad,<br>I was wondering about the capacity that each server has for zones. When EQ started, the only zones were from the 'old world'. Then the Kunark zones were added, then Velious and soon Luclin. What is the limit for zones? Is there one? Are the servers actually single box solutions, or is each 'server' a number of machines, making the number of zones almost unlimited? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Robert <br><br><b>The sever architecture behind EverQuest is very modular, with zones running on multiple machines. So as we expand the world (which really means simply adding more zones), we also add more &#8216;zone servers.&#8217; Kunark and Velious added several machines per world, as will Luclin. As for a limit, I&#8217;m sure there is one, because there are still functions that need to be centralized. But, luckily for us, technology has continued to advance such that we&#8217;ve always been able to upgrade both our central and zone computer hardware with faster and faster components. </b><br><br>------------ <br><br>Brad,<br>I'm really curious about how all the EQ servers are housed, i mean, there's over 30 servers and they gotta be huge, do you all house them in a big building? Does everyone on the EQ team work there as well? or are you all really covert and hanging out in mom's garage powering these beasts?<br><br>(name excluded please) <br><br><b>This question, the previous one, and many others were about EverQuest servers and topology. Scott McDaniel (our VP of Marketing) and Adam Joffe (our Director of Operations) recently did an interview where they discuss our servers at <a href="http://www.hostingtech.com/eb/01_06_everquest.html">http://www.hostingtech.com/eb/01_06_everquest.html</a> -- check it out and let us know what you think. </b><br><br>----------- <br><br>Greetings !<br><br><br>My question is in regards to the Luclin expansion. As an answer to a previous question you stated that the zones in the old world zones would not be enhanced with the new Luclin engine. My question is about the characters, will those all have the new look once the expansion is enabled? Will we have to remake our characters to get the new look?<br><br><br>Thank you for your time<br><br><br>Miscai<br>Shadow Guard<br>Sullon Zek <br><br><b>Don&#8217;t worry &#8211; no need to remake any characters (that is, unless you decide to start a new Kerran character). The new character graphics will show up for all characters if you upgrade to the Expansion and turn those graphics on (even if you do upgrade, you&#8217;ll have the option to turn them off if you still prefer the older graphics). And you&#8217;ll see the new characters on Luclin as well as on the Old World. </b><br><br>---------- <br><br>What are your thoughts on having one character per account on a server? I personally think it shot down two birds with one stone. It made twinking much harder and also made people think twice about soiling their reputations. Will this be considered in future EQ servers and future games, and is it Boxers or Briefs for you? <br><br>Surefoot Twelvetoes<br>Sterling Order of Knights<br>Fennin Ro <br><br><b>I definitely think fewer characters per server is a good thing. To understand why there are eight character slots per server, we&#8217;ll have to take another walk down memory lane: :)<br><br>Back when we were designing the game, we had NO clue if it would turn out to be popular or not. We certainly had no idea we&#8217;d end up with 30+ servers. In fact, we were thinking we&#8217;d have five or six at most. And because we wanted to have a game with 12 races and 14 classes, we also wanted to make sure players had the opportunity to explore and enjoy most of those race/class combos, should they so choose. <br><br>Obviously, with 20/20 hindsight and 30+ servers, eight character slots per world isn&#8217;t necessary. And that is why you see the feature restricted on Sullon Zek and the future RP server. We will also consider fewer character slots with our future games. <br><br>ps. Briefs :)</b><br><br>--------- <br><br>Just a couple of questions about Luclin and stuff. <br><br>I know that current characters will have the option to "remodel" their character in the expansion, such as changing faces, etc. <br><br>1. Will you be able to colour hair? Just curious. <br><br><b>Don&#8217;t think so, no. </b><br><br>2. Will current characters be able to opt *not* to turn into a new model? <br><br><b>You&#8217;ll be able to toggle between showing all player characters using the new models or the old (but probably not a combination thereof). </b><br><br>3. Will people who do not upgrade to Luclin (I don&#8217;t imagine there will be many. :)) be able to see the new models? (They'll obviously have to have higher system specs if they will be able to) <br><br><b>No, they&#8217;ll need to buy Luclin in order to see the new models. </b><br><br>4. Will my paladin ever be able to wear a plate helm without it looking like a bucket on his head? :)<br><br><b>We&#8217;ll have to wait and see :)</b><br><br>5. Do you think that SOE is trying to gain a monopoly on the MMOG market? They've already got Infantry, EQ, SW:Galaxies, and a few others I cant remember... <br><br><b>I certainly wouldn&#8217;t call us a monopoly, because we currently have some formidable competitors and there are also lots of future MMOGs in development. That said, with both the experience gained and the pool of talent we&#8217;ve put together, I definitely think SOE/Verant is poised to be this market&#8217;s leader for quite some time to come. </b><br><br>6. Do you and the GMs have LAN parties on your what must be an unimaginably sweet office setup? :)<br><br><b>Heh, not often enough :)</b><br><br>I think thats all. :)<br><br>Delphi <br><br>--------- <br><br>Hi Brad, <br><br>I was recently reading through your posts and stumbled on your comments regarding DirectX and OpenGL. <br><br>I beg to differ on one point. There is an advantage to using OpenGL, and that is EQ could more easily be ported to Linux or MacOS. I for one, would love to see a MacOS port. I have many friends who are unable to play EQ, because they are Mac diehards and refuse to pay Mr. Gates. <br><br>While I realize it is probably too late for EQ, are there plans to port future Verant MMORPG titles (SWG -- *hint* *hint*) to other platforms? <br><br>- Samoy Spiritstorm<br>51 Enchanter, Povar <br><br><b>That&#8217;s a very valid point &#8211; it&#8217;s definitely easier to port to other platforms using OpenGL. Unfortunately, however, EverQuest is very Win32-centric, and not only because we chose to use Direct X, so I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be seeing it ported any time soon. <br><br>Our second generation engines, however, are being designed from the ground up to be much more portable. </b><br><br>---------- <br><br>Short and simple question: Why didn't casters get disciplines, or some equivalent ability? <br><br>Gihmle Gearbungler <br><br><b>Short and simple answer: We came up with disciplines so we could enhance the melee classes because it didn&#8217;t make sense to give them spells. In other words, casters get new spells instead. </b><br><br>---------- <br><br>I was wondering... I noticed every Expansion of EQ comes with a map with the new continent added (i.e. Kunark, Velious). Well this may seem a silly question, but how do you plan on adding the moon to this map? Isn&#8217;t the moon a Three Dimensional land? Will there be a nice cardboard un-foldable cut out? <br><br>-jonglo <br><br><b>Luclin will indeed come with a new map, and hopefully in a more unique and three-dimensional format. </b><br><br>------ <br><br>Why are some, smaller cities divided into zones, like Kaladim and Felwithe? It seems like they could've easily been one zone, especially when compared to other one-zone places. <br><br>- Kronx-Zeb <br><br><b>Many of the earlier zones were so large that the game designers had to split them up because they were too large to work on all in one piece. Zones like those you mentioned, as well as Solusek&#8217;s Eye, Qeynos, and many others began as one zone but were later split into two (or even three with Neriak) because the files grew so large it brought their systems to a crawl. More recently, with Kunark and Velious, we were able to make large, single zones, because PCs are so much faster now (speedier CPUs, more RAM, and better 3D cards). </b><br><br>-------- <br><br>Brad - <br><br>I remember reading about a possible EQ comic book and some fantasy novels coming out. Is this being developed? <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Nylia Femina <br><br><b>Funny you should ask that, because Jeff Butler and I are having lunch tomorrow with Jim Lee to check on the comic's process. Jim is a very busy guy, but we do plan on getting this comic done this year (I hope). And for those of you familiar with Jim Lee&#8217;s art, well, you know the comic will certainly be worth the wait. </b><br><br>------- <br><br><b>Thanks for all your emails! Keep 'em coming :)<br><br>-Brad </b></UL>

It's been a quiet couple of days on the Developer's Corner.  Today's only highlight was <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html">this post made by Alan</a> speaking on the subject of the RP server:<UL>LaBeau wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Neutral person clicks on Troll SK, -Invite-<br>Neutral person clicks on Human Pali -Invite-<br><br>Both then click on -follow-<br><br>May haps make it so Neutral people can't -Invite- people, because, who would 'follow' a neutral person? (Gahndi doesn't count) You could 'invite' a neutral person to 'come over to the dark side Luke', and he would have to become a 'follower of the dark side' I would imagine he would have to take a faction hit for following one or the other. Group with evil to much, and you are no longer neutral, but evil. ]</i></font><br><br>Not a problem. No matter how hard you try, those two clicks can't happen at the same time. One has to be processed before the other. So one of those folks is going to be rejected from the group. <br><br>Temporary wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I really think that any "RP sever" will have to be PVP in order to BE RP. I mean, what exactly is a dark elf and high elf suppose to do when they bump into each other? Scowl at and insult each other in different languages and then move on? ]</i></font><br><br>They should duel each other, if their conflict comes to blows. <br><br>This server is going to be Player vs Environment (PvE) for the simple reason that it seems the most popular choice. A lot of people prefer not to be involved in PvP at all. <br><br>While I agree that a true roleplaying server would have to involve PvP, there are too many people that would use their ability to kill other characters for the express purpose of making people unhappy. For this server, we're not allowing that. <br><br>This isn't really one of the negotiable points at this time. The basis for this server is a roleplaying oriented non-PvP server. From there we build the rules. <br><br>Who knows what we'll do after this, but for now, this one's non-PvP. <br><br>CidHighwind wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, just do us one favor and admit that you realize that we the paying customers do not want items to be more rare. Just because you think rarer items would be good does not mean we do, I ask that you admit you would be doing it against our desires. ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry, can't do that. <br><br>It's simply true, there are a lot of people that want items to be more rare in the game. <br><br>On this server I wouldn't be surprised to find that some of the higher end items remain more rare than they are on other servers because some tasks are harder to do when you can't just group any characters with any other characters. You might not see necromancers helping paladins to obtain their flaming swords. You may not see too many dark elves helping high elf magicians kill dark elven magicians in Najena so that the high elf can get a focus. <br><br>While there are certainly people that will not like this restriction, there are many that will. Just as Sullon Zek does not appeal to folks that do not like PvP, the roleplaying server will not appeal to people that prefer convenience over roleplaying. And that's just fine. These special rules servers can't appeal to a broad group. In fact, the point is to make a rule set that appeals to a rather narrow group. As long as that group is large enough to fill at least one server, we're good to go. <br><br>LaranosTZ wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have given it some thought regarding the green/loot code options you have proposed for the new role playing server, and I have come to the conclusion that it is a -bad- idea. I will use the most extreme example for my example, that of the mage epic quest. <br><br>The mage epic quest contains a grand total of 9 items which drop off of blue or better mobs at level 50. This is in contrast to the 15 items which are needed off of green mobs, often times in isolated areas, which comprise the majority of the time invested into this quest. Many of the other epic quests are the same way...several difficult battles which result in primary items, but massive amounts of items which simply must be camped by a character in areas quite green to them. With this new loot system, you are essentially requiring a character to start their epic quest in their thirties, or even in some cases, their twenties. Considering the length of time I have camped one of the green items in my quest, and also considering that almost all the green items are in the same level range, it is also possible that even if you -started- camping epic items when they were blue to you, or even yellow/red...it is quite likely that by the time you had almost attained them all, some of the creatures would have become green, thus negating all your previous efforts, unless you de-level to meet that. <br><br>I admit, this is an extreme example, but it is analgous to what many players do in the everquest environment. They are unable to complete quests until they are able to tackle quest components in green environments. By instituting warrens loot code, those efforts would be impossible, and thus, many quests would become unreachable for a large portion of the player base, unless the quests were revised a very large amount. ]</i></font><br><br>Hmmm&#8230; <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>essentially requiring a character to start their epic quest in their thirties, or even in some cases, their twenties. <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>And this is a bad thing? <br><br>I don't think so. In fact, most of those epic quests were designed to be worked on as you go. The idea is that they are the culmination of your character's career, not the efforts of a lot of work at the end of your career. Doing them as you go is the idea. <br><br>The fact that many people don't tackle these things until the NPCs involved are very green to them&#8230; well that's kind of the issue being addressed with the anti-bottom feeding code. Tackle things when they are challenging, not when they are simply a matter of one-shotting some poor Gnoll. <br><br>The valid concern is, well, what if I didn't look up the spoilers and learn the steps that I needed and missed one. With the anti-bottom feeding code I can't go back and make up the missed part. <br><br>That's why Brad suggested removing all no-drop code on this server. If you missed it then you can pay a bunch of adventurers to go get the item for you. Isn't that the essence of your standard roleplaying adventure? Some powerful guy is too busy to go do something himself, so he tosses some coin at adventurers who go tackle something tough (for them) and come back wondering why they risk their lives for mere coins? <br><br>Nektik wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a quick question regarding languages on the planned 'rp' server. <br><br>Will NPCs speak their racial langauges?<br>In other words, will we need to learn Human to do a quest out of Freeport? ]</i></font><br><br>Right now I just don't know. I'd like to see it work that way. But there might just be too many issues with doing that. I'll let you know what comes up in that regard. <br><br>Elkanah wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I was wondering what language a druid in wolf-form would speak? Would the druid be reduced to barks? :)]</i></font><br><br>Now <i>that</I> would be great. :)<br><br>Thanks for all the comments. Keep them coming. <br><br>Alan</UL>
