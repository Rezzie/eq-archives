As promised, Gordon Wrinn posted a summary of the tuning meeting held today at Sony HQ in San Diego, CA.  Also of note, the Rogue class may be getting some attention.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053682.html">the post</a>:<UL><I>Hello all, <br><br>I thought I'd bring a quick list of some things decided in today's tuning meeting. There's not much information here besides what I'll list, but please feel free to comment:<br><br>* Concerning Nagafen and Vox: We're looking into a way to keep Nagafen and Vox as reasonable encounters for the high-30s-50s characters without having the high 50s+ killing them constantly with little opposition. <br>* We'll be extending the "Rez-for-XP" window from 2 hours to 3 hours in light of size and difficulty of some of the new zones.<br>* VZ/TZ move: See other thread.<br>* We're looking at a way to stop players from bypassing the need for a rogue by using an NPC to open pickable doors. In other words, make friends with your local rogue :) <br>* Poison update is expected on Test next week.<br>* "Jolt" will have its casting time lowered.<br>* The Hole is expected to go live this week.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon shed some light as to what is the current status of the big Vallon Zek/Tallon Zek transfer option.  Here's his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053663.html">original post</a> in it's entirety:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>Due to the results of the /movelog command executed by players on the PvP-Teams servers the weekend before last, we are reconsidering our decision to do the move. Out of nearly 1800 accounts across TZ and VZ that requested move, only 278 asked to be moved from TZ (Coin only) to VZ (Coin and Item loot), while 1513 requested a move in the other direction.<br><br>The result of completing this move would most likely result in crowding on the Tallon Zek server while leaving Vallon Zek nearly empty. While we have considered allowing a smaller number of people to move from Vallon to Tallon, we've concluded that that would most likely be more destructive to server morale than our current plan. <br><br>As of now, and for the reasons stated above, our plan is to change the Vallon Zek server to Coin-only loot making it identical to Tallon Zek in that respect. <br><br>We'll wait a few days to view comments here prior to finalizing the decision. Please followup here with your thoughts.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Gordon was back answering questions and posting to the Gameplay Board today.  Here is all the latest: <UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053672.html"><b>Guild Housing </b> (Officially Canned)</a><br><i>[Quote from original post: It would be nice to have a place called home not just the city where you started. You can rest there without being attacked, store food and supplies. Why not other games have it?]</i> <br><br>Though we considered the idea in EQ, we ended up waiving it in favor of spending more time on the adventure aspects of the game. Overall I think it was a good choice given our goals and timing constraints.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053649.html"><b>eBay Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I am kinda getting bored with my character. Is it against the rules to trade accounts with another player? Now before you say no as fast as you can, think about it. You are only trading an in game commodity for another in game commodity, that being characters. Almost like trading all of your gear for all of someone else's gear, and trading all of your 'class A' exp for all of their 'class B' exp. <br><br>Yes, this is also against the rules. Though I appreciate your arguments, trading a sword for another sword in game (perfectly acceptable) is not the same as trading characters or accounts. Transfer of accounts has always been prohibited. <br><br>It's not just the philosophical ideals concerning gameplay, but the amount of fraud that results in such transactions. Even with our policies as they are, completely forbidding character sales and account transfers, we still receive a number of emails daily citing fraud in relation to account transfers.]</i><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053646.html"><b>Cleric Armor</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I'd like to know why the cleric arms from the Ostiary in the library in Sebilis were nerfed, without any warning. These arms had the effect of Valor, which could be cast every 6 seconds. After the patch last week, they now take twice as long to cast, which in essence has rendered them useless, since Remedy and Superior Heal can be cast much faster with great hp return, even tho they cost mana and the arms do not. These were one of the nicest cleric pieces in the game, and like everything else that proves useful to a class, wound up getting nerfed and made useless without warning or explanation.]</i> <br><br>First, I apologize for the fact that this wasn't listed in the patch message. <br><br>As for why they were changed, as you mentioned, use of the arms for the purpose of healing rather than for the "buff" that it gave was the primary motivation. The fact that that whole series increases current hitpoints in addition to max hitpoints was based on it being balanced by mana usage. Since the arms do not use mana, the casting-time becomes the entire cost. A cost of six seconds was too low for what it granted.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053642.html"><b>/Friends Increasement Status</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 20 friends just isn't enough for a happy-go-lucky flesh-pressing baby-kissing ogre warrior like myself. What is the status on increasing the size of the /friend list?]</i> <br><br>We've had to back-burner (postpone indefinitely) any plans to due this due to some technical issues. If we take it up actively again in the future I'll be sure to let everyone know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053644.html"><b>Spell Drops</b></a><br>We've tested and found the spelldrops appropriate at this time. They did increase, but as I said they weren't being increased to the point that people would find them plentiful by any means. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053640.html"><b>Tuning Meeting</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon, It's Monday. How did that tuning meeting go?]</i> <br><br>The tuning meeting went well. I think I'll post a summary a bit later.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053634.html"><b>Linux Port & Development Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I know this is cluching at straws, but any chance of having EQ run on Linux?]</i> <br><br>We've no plans at this time to develop or release additional platform ports of the EverQuest client. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Also, what system was EQ developed on? If you can reply to that one without revealing too much...]</i> <br><br>We use different tools for many different aspects of EQ. Outdoor geometry, indoor geometry, object building, character building, texture art, etc., all take place in different software packages. As for actual programming, it's done primarily in a combination of C and C++. <br><br>As for what particular hardware platform is used for each thing, it varies between WinTel stuff, various Unix platforms, and the like.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053625.html"><b>The Simple Truth</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The more time spent regaining levels and leveling itself, the more months you spend on the game, and the more money Verant gets.]</i> <br><br>Actually we prefer to look at it from the standpoint that the longer we can keep you entertained, challenged, and intrigued, the longer you'll play the game. We believe that things earned are cherished more than things given, which is why some work is necessary in order to advance. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Now for some, the fact that Verant MAKES you spend more months and months to "win"(achieving level 60) in this game and getting more money from its accounts may bother alot of people.]</i> <br><br>There is no way to "win" in EverQuest. Though some might hold "level 60" as the main goal they wish to reach, research shows that people don't "reach 60 and quit", or previously, "reach 50 and quit" like posts of this nature purport. We don't "make" you spend time to do anything. You choose a goal that you want to acheive and make the decision to do whatever is necessary to achieve it. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: The simple truth is, exp loss will not change...]</i> <br><br>Very true, but as mentioned above, it's not some devious thing to "make" you play longer. It's a risk that is present in order to provide challenge, making it difficult to obtain goals, which a big part of the reason that people play the game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053623.html"><b>Caster Loot</b></a><br>I guess that one of the situations is that things that are considered "good" caster loot aren't very diverse. Int casters want int, and that's it. Wis casters want wis, and that's it. Now, since the int/wis softcaps weren't changed in regards to Kunark, a lot of people are running around right up against 200 points. There's only so much more that can be done with them. <br><br>Melee characters on the other hand need weapons, AC, and every other stat they can get. As a caster, I really don't care about AC items that I can get, since if I get hit I'm dead anyway. <br><br>Basically, one of the cool things about being a melee class is that more options are open to you in regards to equipment. I think that casters will always be at a disadvantage in this area.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053584.html"><b>The Hole</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Has anyone taken a look at the items that will be coming from the hole to prevent more post-release item nerfs? You know what I'm talking about. Robe of Living Fungus, Wind Saber, Rod of Mourning, Vambraces of Mourning, Manastone, Mistwalker, etc..]</i> <br><br>Sure, we've looked at the items, but as always I cannot guarantee that post-release adjustments won't be necessary. As always, 250k+ people can find more issues than any test team could. I certainly wish this wasn't the case, but the only way we could eliminate the need for any post-production changes with certainty would be to stop any post-production enhancements to the game. I doubt anyone would like that option either.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053549.html"><b>Unreliable Binds</b></a><br>I've heard reports about this from time to time. To my knowledge, our testing team hasn't been able to find a reliable way to reproduce this. It would be nice to hear if anyone has a way to help us track this issue down.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053580.html"><b>Disappearing Boats</b></a><br>We're working on the problem with the disappearing boats. In the meantime, feel free to petition a GM should they appear inoperational. I do apologize for the delay in addressing this issue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053544.html"><b>Trolls and Centaurs </b></a><br>Centaurs are ornery and irrational creatures. It seems that they are prone to fits of rage for little to no reason, and have been known at times to attack nearly anyone. We think that it has something to do with tension in the area created by the number of people encroaching on their hunting grounds. <br><br>As for your LD and where your corpse went, LD's will happen from time to time in internet based games for a number of reasons. As we don't have control over the majority of individual LDs, we don't do resurrections for most of them. Corpses have also been known to end up strange places when dying while LD. If it ends up someplace inaccessible (like on top of a mountain that a player cannot climb), the GMs will be happy to move it. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052995.html"><b>Shackle of Ro Not Fixed?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Not to be a pain in the tuckas, but still no finger bones to complete the quest. If it does work and we are just looking in the completely wrong place tell us...You don't need to tell us where, just confirm it is working...]</i> <br><br>Can anyone attest to finding fingerbones? In the meantime, I'll ask the designer of this quest to take a look.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053380.html"><b>Crashing</b></a><br>I'd be interested to know if your crashing is sound-related. Do you still have the problem if you turn off all sound support in the Windows control panel? Is your crashing zone-specific? <br><br>I'd really like to help solve the problem, however as we don't have a whole lot of people having crashing problems, it suggests a driver or hardware-specific issue. We are continuing to work on the sound-related issues, and will probably have a new patch up in that regard in the next couple of weeks.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053440.html"><b>Track Corpse for Necros</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Just wanted to remind you/inform you that this spell has been broken since the release of it. It does nothing when cast. This has been verified on all servers as far as I heard.]</i> <br><br>Yes, we're aware of the problem. It's in our bug database. If I get an ETA on it I'll be sure to let everyone know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051287-8.html"><b>Lack of Paladin Weapons</b></a><br>I had the guys run off a report of weapons that Paladins can wield. I've a list of well over 300 1HS and 2HS weapons in game for them, and over 150 1HB and 2HB weapons. It's hard to say how many of them are class-specific. <br><br>That said, just looking at some of the other things that have been released, it appears that there might be (stress *might*) some disparity between SK and Paly weapons in Kunark. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean that there is a problem. If you recall, SKs were quite vocal about the lack of 1H weapons in game for them prior to Kunark. <br><br>I'll mention this thread to the guys, but just to be clear, I'm not promising anything, and usually won't give periodic updates on item-related issues.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044612-8.html"><b>Rain Spells</b></a><br>I've read the original author's post, and from what I see it's pretty accurate. Rain spells consider all targets in their field, whether or not those targets can actually be damaged. This is the way that the rain spells work. Now if this makes them completely "useless" in all cases, perhaps we need to look at them again, but at the moment they are working as designed. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052923.html"><b>Spellbook Follow-up</b></a><br>The spellbook obscuring the view is part of the "penalty" that lower-level casters pay in exchange for the power that they will receive later in life. From an RP perspective, the caster was so focused on meditating that they perceived little about what was happening in the world around them. Back in early beta we didn't even allow casters to speak while medding. <br><br>I think most are happy that we changed this stance in the interest of gameplay.</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
An interesting situation has been developing over the weekend on the Gameplay Board.  It was called to my attention today by the following post Gordon Wrinn just made:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>The post by "Habenera", titled "Exposed- The Real Facts" was deleted because it purported to contain confidential and proprietary personnel information in regards to the EverQuest Guide Program. While I cannot comment on the authenticity or lack thereof in regards to the posted information, it is not appropriate for us to allow true or manufactured information of that type to be passed on to the public as "fact". <br><br>That said, the original poster of that message, "Habenera", does not speak for and is not affiliated with Verant Interactive or the EverQuest Guide program. I do indeed apologize to anyone subjected to the rantings of this individual. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Upon further investigation I discovered this was linked with a post Gordon Wrinn made last week asking a former guide named "rpgadvocate" to personally email him.  Rpgadvocate made his response public and you can <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053028.html">read it by clicking here</a>.  I have come to the conclusion that the reason Gordon asked him to email him was to deal with his views of the GM/Guide system in private.<br><br>A few minutes later someone, presumably from the guide program, posted rpgadvocate's personal file, which was the force behind the post Gordon made.  Yes, we know that post was been published on other sites and boards but I will <b>not</b> be posting it here. (so please don't email me asking for a link to it)<br><br>To cap things off <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/">Lum the Mad</a> obtained the following response rpgadvocate posted:<BLOCKQUOTE>This is entirely too scary. Let me explain:<br><br>&#8226; Those records are accurate. I was ejected from the program the first week in February. One thing he has wrong however is that I was indeed asked to resign, but I refused on principle.<br><br>&#8226; So what this must mean is that a Verant employee who has access to database edits posted a portion of those records here, SERIOUSLY violating privacy policies. Verant needs to find out who the rogue poster is and fire him or her.<br><br>&#8226; About my attitude. Yes, I expressed my frustration to players on many occasions, telling them that while I believed many of their stories, I was powerless to do anything, and that they should /feedback, post, and generally make noise about poor policies. As for the guide messageboard, I did post a couple of vicious flames, but I believe I was justified in doing so, considering the abuse issues I was posting about. When I say "vicious" I mean scathing arguments, not childish prattle (except in one case, for which I apologized later).<br><br>&#8226; I was very lenient with everyone except those whom I actually witnessed multi-KSing, multi-training, and whatnot. I was stern with those folk, as there was nothing I could do officially, since the PNP wasn't in force at the time.<br>Both these attitudes caused me trouble in the program, as being a policy-bot is the only acceptable way to act. <br><br>&#8226; So does that mean my Guiding was impeccable? OF COURSE NOT!! One night I acted like a complete ass, as I had had a bad day. Guess what I spent the first 20 minutes of my shift doing the next day? You guessed it! APOLOGIZING to everyone that was online that I was short and rude to the previous evening. GMs need to own up to trouble like that.<br><br>&#8226; Finally, you made my argument more powerful than I ever could have. This foul deed is exactly the kind of abuse that I allege is routine within Verant.</BLOCKQUOTE>We'll bring you any updates (depending on their importantance and relevance) concerning this situation as they occur.

Also new the Editorial section is another article written by Oakgrove Fallingleaf.  This one, entitled <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid961380015,57564,">Quit Yer Whinin'</a>, deals with evil race factions in Kunark.  Here's a clip: <UL><i>In fact, I see the complexity of the factions on Kunark to be colorful<br>obstacles to be overcome by those who are the most ingenious. Further,<br>I would not characterize Kunark as a region in which high-levels should<br>concentrate on levelling quickly - much of what is there is to provide a<br>variety of challenges rather than the ability to race through levels. <br>Moreso, I was glad to see the experience lowered for monsters of the<br>same caliber elsewhere in order to slow level advancement and<br>concentrate on the environment and thrill of the game.</i></UL>Thank Oakgrove!

The topics of linkdeath and PvP where the issues recently addressed by Sony's Gordon Wrinn.  The following contains excerpts from the original post along with Gordon's entire response:<UL>Its always bugged me that when you go link dead everyone in the zone can see that your link dead. What is the point of this? the only people that need to know are the people in your group, NOT everyone in the zone. If you dont play on the PVP servers then its no big deal, but if you do its so unfair. You go link dead, you log back on only to find out that you got pked, lost an item and you have no idea who killed you. The really sad thing is the last time i was pked from a LD, the guy that killed me was 4 levels below me. <br><br><b><i>I do wonder if the benefit to be obtained by removing the linkdead notation in the /who list is less than that that would be lost. If people in your group miss the message, they can always check the /who list. If people who are not in your group are talking to you, they can /who and see that you are LD and not just ignoring them. I really doubt that the linkdead-PK issues happen enough to be a concern. As long as people cannot force others to go LD, they shouldn't be able to reliably hunt LD players.</b></i><br><br>LD players (casters) should be casting spells to the best of there abilities. <br><br><b><i>Since LD players are NPCs in most cases, and since NPCs follow different rules on what they can and cannot cast, players casting created a number of problems where people would mem spells that they can't cast in a particular area and go LD on purpose. </b></i><br><br>Remove the text message that tells everyone in the zone that you went LD.<br><br><b><i>See above.</b></i><br><br>If you go LD BEFORE you get attacked, nobody can loot you. If i cant tell who killed me then nobody should be allowed to loot me.<br><br><b><i>I don't believe that the information relating to when you were attacked versus when you went LD is available at the time of the kill. All that's known is that you were attacked and that you are now dead. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

A case of "insane GM behavior" was reported on the Gameplay Board recently.  Here's the original post followed by Gordon's response:<UL>I allowed my friend to play with my lvl 20 woodelf warrior. Big mistake.<br>The kunark boats were down, so he was summoned to firiona by GMs, then wandered off into the forest to be slaughtered by Drachnids and Drolvarg. Naturally his bind point was in Faydark.<br><br><br>I came and took over at this point. I asked if the GMs could summon me back (once he got to the BB docks). Nope, the boats were back up. So I waited half an hour and took the boats. I proceeded to tell the GM i was in contact with what had happened and the terrible situation my corpse was in. He said: I will summon the corpse to a safe location.<br><br>Beginning of insane GM behavior: he would not tell me the location he summoned the corpse to. By the time I got to firiona I still couldnt pry it out of him. I wasnt asking for a rezz...I was asking where he put my corpse! At least I KNEW where it was before, even if it was surrounded by Drachnids. The GM keeps giving me the standard "sorry I cant help you with this".<br>I didnt have any money in the bank (it was all on my corpse) so I had to sell some of my more expensive items to merchants so that I could get a Chipped Bone Rod from Firiona merchants (no bards to be had and no necro would go to firiona vie). I used a couple of the prescious charges to determine that the 'safe location' was somewhere thru that nest of Drolvarg thingies...deep reds.<br><br>It's been 2 hours since I died. I'm getting tired of this. I tell the GM to just put the corpse back where he found it. You know what? HE WOULDNT EVEN DO THAT. He basically screwed me over and then wouldnt undo it even when it was obvious that it had hurt more than helped.<br><br>For the next 2 hours I just begged people to tell me if they saw the corpse or if they could escort me out to where I thought it was. So there I was, naked lvl 20 woodelf warrior, strolling around aggro reds with no guards in sight. Well, somebody finds the corpse...I somehow get back to Firiona unscathed...get the corpse...all is well, nothing but a little exp loss.<br><br>Abashi, can you justify the 4-hour corpse-juggling this GM put me thru? (i dont have the gms name atm, I will get it asap and post it)<br><br><b><i>I really don't know why the GM even got involved with this situation to begin with. You let someone else play your character (which, for future reference is not allowed by the EULA), and that person got it in a rough spot. The GMs certainly aren't there to save people from their own bad decisions, but to assist when things that shouldn't happen do.<br><br>That said, if a CS rep made the mistake to get involved in the first place, moving the corpse and not telling you where it was was worse of a mistake than carrying the corpse to you would have been, so please accept my apologies.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon responded to a post claiming that some JBoots are rigged to blow.  Here's the original post followed by Gordon's response:<UL>Be on the lookout for exploding Jboots.<br><br>I (level 50 Necro) was in the process of redoing the shadowbound quests (had just given my robe, gloves and boots to my wifes Necro) and had gathered all the quest components with the exception of the Shadowed Man items. Normally I have hunted them in South Karana, but this time, for convenience sake, I was going to kill them in Lavastorm. After killing a couple, I decided to scout for a new location with better visibility. I found such a location, parked my pet, and right clicked on my jboots in preparation for going up the hill the to pull a shadowed man. The second I clicked upon my jboots BANG! Dead. I checked the scrollback when I reappeared at my bind point and the only lines which appeared were Your feet feel quick (or whatever the Jboots line is) immediately followed by Loading Please Wait...<br>No non melee falling damage, no NPC spell casting, etc. Only instantaneous damage of over 900hps the second I clicked on my boots.<br><br>Of course I petitioned and of course was told politely by a guide that there was nothing that they could do about it, etc, etc. I decided to camp at my bind point at that point instead of making the trudge back to my body.<br><br>I myself am going to take a couple of weeks off to decide if it's worth playing again. I definately do not expect Verant to believe every single player of this game when they die due to suspicous reasons - that's not the point. What the point IS however is that in a codebase as large as EQ must be, along with a host of other things that could cause illogical deaths it sucks to be the first or the second or third to die due to a bug (or in some cases many more) since instantly you are branded a liar and seen as trying to scam the system.<br><br>In 50 levels my Necro has died countless times. Same goes for my 40 Druid, 21 Warrior, and all the rest of my EQ toons. Only three times have I petitioned. Once to report a trade bug (and I stated in the petition that I didn't expect anything to be done, I was simply reporting it), a second time when someone was being overly profane in ooc, and this, the third time. You'd have thought if I was trying to "scam the system" I wouldn't have waited till I had well over 100 levels of playtime under my belt.<br><br>Ah well, just a warning to everyone who's got em. Be carefull when clicking on your Jboots. When I asked if I should continue to use my Jboots I was told that if I didn't want to risk another death, I would probably be better off not using them. If you aren't prepared to pay with your EQ life and a healthy chunk of xp, you probably should bank your Jboots for a while.<br><br><b><i>I've never heard of this happening before. It's certainly not something that we put in intentionally. I would encourage anyone experiencing this to /report it and then /petition a gm. <br><br>If anyone else has had this happen I'd like to hear about it.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Brad McQuaid was on the boards today answering a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052361-2.html">post concerning the clipping plane</a> issue.  Here's the original post followed by Brad's response:<UL>I've been saying for MONTHS that the clipping plane slider bar is bugged. But Verant has yet to fix it. They say they have moved out the file header to max on the server, but since this is a client side bug, its still not fixed. I finnally got fed up at being believed by everyone BUT Verant, so I took the time to makes these pictures.<br>As you can see, as the rain subsites, it moves off, reveiling the real max clipping plane, but when the rain actually stops, the haze sets in, breaking the clipping planes max distance.<br>Abashi said that the clipping plane on each zone was set to max. Well if it was set to max, why is the rain able to go farther out then we are able to see? <br>I also made a comparison picture so you could see the difference.<br>----------------------------------<br><br>Here we have a normal day of EQ (typhoon)<br><br><a href="http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRaining.jpg">http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRaining.jpg</a><br><br>----------------------------------<br><br>Here we have the rain moving off, and as you can see, it reveils a lot of open land. This wasn't even the farthest it goes, but its hard to take a pic at the right time when you only have 2 seconds.<br><br><a href="http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRainStopping.jpg">http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRainStopping.jpg</a><br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>Here is what we normally see. Lots of sky, not much land. The above might not look like a lot of extra land, but when you take the time to study it, you can see that it really can ammount to a LOT of extra distance.<br><br><a href="http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRainStopped.jpg">http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereRainStopped.jpg</a><br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>Here is a comparison of the 2 views. I didn't want to confuse anyone and have them say that "They can't see the difference"<br><br><a href="http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereCompare.jpg">http://members.home.net/fireflyis/OverthereCompare.jpg</a><br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>Any Questions?<br><br><b><i>First, thanks for the screenshots -- it helped us understand part of this issue.<br>Jeff Butler and I looked into this personally today and came to some conclusions.<br><br>But first, some info into how clipping planes work.<br><br>1. When an outdoor zone is exported from the tools we use to create it, the artist chooses a maximum clip plane. This setting affects how far out visibility is calculated, and can affect file size and frame rate.<br><br>2. Most old world zones were exported with a much lower number than most Kunark zones.<br><br>3. Each zone has a minimum and maximum clip plane number associated with it server side. These are the numbers you move between when you adjust the clipping plane slider in-game.<br><br>4. The slider bar is supposed to work as a percentage. In other words, in one zone if the min is 1 and the max 1000, were the slider in the center, you'd be at 500. But if the min was 1 and the max 100, say for another zone, you'd be at 50 with the slider in the middle.<br><br>Ok, so, after looking into this and checking out the screenshots referred to in this thread we were able to determine the following:<br><br>1. For some reason (we'll ask the programmer tomorrow), when rain stops, the clipping plane moves out beyond the max briefly and then settles back at the max. For example, I went to Overthere and verified what the screenshots showed: the Overthere's max clip is 1800 feet. It looked like the clip went to 2000 or so briefly when the sky was still gray and then returned to 1800 when the sky was on again.<br><br>2. Another bug (though not terribly consequential) is that depending on the max clip, the clip slider bar appears to do nothing the last 25% or so. I was in the Overthere using the clip slider and watching the clipping plane distance in feet (something that doesn't show on the normal client) and it got to the max, 1800, at around 75% of the slider bar.<br><br>Ok, so what does this all mean? And could people see farther in the past?<br><br>Possibly, yes -- we've changed the max clipping plane in zones several times. The fact that the slider bar appears to max out early, though, isn't stopping you from setting your clipping plane to the max setting server side. Neither is the rain.<br><br>A good question, though, is 'if the Overthere displays out to 2000 briefly, why isn't the max clip for the Overthere 2000?'<br><br>I agree. What we'll do is go through the zones again and make sure the max server side is really the max the zone was exported at.<br><br>Do keep this in mind, though: we cannot move the max clip beyond the clipping distance the zone was originally exported at -- the visibility data is just not there and you'll see nothing beyond that hard limit. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the old world zones had max clips between 600 and 1500 feet. In other words, East Commons will never have a clip of 1800 or 2000 like the Overthere could.<br><br>I'll also ask that the bug associated with the rain that has the cilp pull back past the max clip be fixed, although honestly, it's not going to be a high priority bug in that it doesn't hurt gameplay.<br><br>Anyway, I hope this clears things up. I'll watch this thread tonight to see if there are any additional questions.<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>Here's the second volley of posts in this thread:<UL>Brad I took a screenshot of each click of the clipping plane slider, from left to right, and took a snapshot of it (you can see its position)<br>I wanted to upload the images but seems @home won't let me upload at the momment... *sigh*<br>I also included a picture from the front of Felwithe that shows the entrace to the city, but the horizon is mostly sky, cause the clipping plane can't go far enough. Before the bug, I used to be able to see a good chunk of the town and NO blue sky at the horizon.<br>Since my server is down, would you like me to zip them up and email them to you?<br><br><b><i>Darkmatter: The slider works fine up until that 75% or so point -- I was watching both the display that showed what the clipping distance is in feet as well as the view in the 3D window.<br>Am I positive that when it says 1800 feet I'm really seeing 1800 feet? *shrug* As much as I can be -- the number is really just relative ('virtual' feet).<br><br>Is it possible that when some weather/fog bugs were looked at that all zones clips were reduced a percentage, but I doubt it. I will ask the programmer to look at that again.<br><br>I really think that having the live team go through and make sure the max_clip is set to as far as one can physically see in the zone (based on the exported zone maximum) is the best solution. Then, as long as you can move the slider to the right and eventually your client's clip is the same as the maximum clip for the zone, everything should be fine.<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>And here's the third and final volley of posts:<UL>Oh while I was watching the rain for 30 minutes while I was making my first set of screenshots I had an idea.<br>Instead of having superlow visibility for all rain, why not have it random.<br><br>Rainstorms aren't always hurricanes.<br><br>You could have it randomly pick how far the clipping plane is brought in, and how hazy it is, and if there was lightning, so you could reproduce a light shower.<br>You could also alter the ammount of light coming in, and the actual rain grafics so it could be raining more, or less. Maybe even at an angle to represent the wind blowing it. Rain should also be seen farther out in the distance, as it is now, the rain is almost totally 2D. (Actually I think it IS 2D. :P)<br><br>And, a cool thing, would be rarely, a really BAD storm where visibility was done to near 0, and rain came down hard, and light was really reduced. But this would have to be really rare or would kinda hamper the gameplay.<br><br>Obviously not a high priority issue but I think it would add to the game. <br><br><b><i>Darkmatter:<br>When I move the slider bar (or hit the + key) it tells me something like: current clip: 500 max clip: 1800. Then, when I move it to about 75% it tells me current 1800 and max 1800 and then it stays at that from 75% to 100%. (which is obviously a bug -- the slider reads 75% but is really at 100%).<br><br>When the max_clips are moved up on Test we will tell you. I will also ask the client programmer to let all players know current and max clip values (like our special client tells us now).<br><br>Your rain ideas are great, and we could possibly randomize the fog distance when raining a little, but not much. The rain drops in EQ are actually polygonal particles, and if you could see very far while it rained your frame rate would approach zero because of all the particles that would be drawn :(<br><br>-Brad</i></b></UL>

As usual, Gordon was once again on the Gameplay Board answering people's questions and responding to comments.  Here's the latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052852.html"><b>Rare Spawn Complaints</b></a><br>Most of the complaints I see in regards to these rare spawns for quest components is related to the general feeling that there is an "entitlement" to these items. There isn't. No one is entitled to any particular item. <br><br>You can't fix a situation where everyone is camping by making what they are camping for more plentiful. That just encourages camping, as the camp duration gets shorter, and more people feeel that the camp time is worth the effort. As it is now, maybe people will get the idea that the camp is too long, and just choose not to camp. Then perhaps someone happening by can get lucky and find the spawn in question. If people are still choosing to camp it, perhaps we need to look into making it even rarer, closing the quest, or look into creating other items that represent reasonable alternatives to the item that people are choosing to camp.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052874.html"><b>EverQuest & FPS Games</b></a><br>I completely agree that Doom and other First-person shooter type games are very fun, despite the lack of a penalty for death. However, those games are not about building and molding a character to your desires. The worlds aren't persistent. There's is nothing that can be achieved by playing for a year that can't be achieved in the first few minutes of each life. <br><br>The games are completely different and cannot be measured against each other. The concept of "Challenge" is implemented in different ways. EverQuest implements challenge by providing risks. In order to provide risks, there must be some downside that will be realised should a task not be completed. That downside can't be enjoyable, or it wouldn't be a risk. <br><br>I do wish that I could explain this to everyone's satisfaction. If anyone can offer any suggestions to this end, I'd certainly appreciate it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052875.html"><b>Gaining Experience</b></a><br>Experience given by a creature is based upon its level, and the zone you are in. It is not based upon its level in relation to you, other than at the point that you stop receiving experience from killing a particular level creature. <br><br>In other words, if you are level 50, a level 49 creature will give more experience than a level 48 creature, even though they are both blue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052873.html"><b>Online Store Status</b></a><br>The status is that the online store in it's former incarnation will probably not be up in the foreseeable future. We are however working on a web-based store that we expect to open in a few weeks.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052845.html"><b>Spell Drops</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I have yet to see a difference in the spell drop rate. Hours of hunting skyfire, chardok, etc. still yield nothing]</i> <br><br>Most people who cite problems with spell drops cite hours of hunting in Skyfire and Chardok. Consider for a moment that though spells drop there, those might not be the best places to find spells.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052735.html"><b>The Bammbo Bo Stick</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: We were told by you Abashi that the Bammbo Bo stick was a mistake and was being lowered in weight.]</i> <br><br>Actually I never said that. I said that some of the monk-only weapons in Kunark were too heavy, and I never meantioned what specific weapons. Anyway, the live team went through the weapons and lowered the weight on some of them. Some of them are remaining rather heavy, and are that way on purpose. <br><br>I'll ask the live team to look it over again, but I wouldn't expect a ton of dramatic changes. The fact that a particular character has the ability to use a particular weapon doesn't necessarily mean that they *should* use it, nor that it's the *best* thing that they could be using. <br><br>Wait until you see some of the cursed items that will begin turning up soon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052614.html"><b>Account Hacking</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon this must be fixed(account hackers) Now this is an ongoing problem and need to be addressed instantly!]</i> <br><br>I would love to be able to find out how this stuff happens. In most cases, we can usually track it back to passwords being given by the account owners to guild members or real-life "friends". In most other cases, it turns out to be some auction or account sales related fraud. <br><br>Players have to be responsible for their own account information and never provide it to anyone. They also need to refrain from buying characters online as the original owner can get the account back at nearly any time. We'll of course ban the account in the case of the latter, but we don't at all get involved with any lost funds. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Set up direct link command just like bug or feedback and have it go directly to all gms guides and customer support peeps online so that the peeps hacking are caught in the act!]</i> <br><br>Very few people could get caught hacking in the act as most people don't have multiple accounts to log in and see it for themselves. That said, some type of more direct system-wide petition would probably end up being used for things other than hacking. <br><br>All of that said, I would like to hear from folks who've had their accounts hacked, and honestly never gave the password to anyone and never bought or sold the account. I do have some questions that I'd like to ask. Please email me at gwrinn@verant.com. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052726-2.html"><b>Why can't Paladins use piercing weapons?</b></a><br>It sounds like it might be possible that some of our apprentice game designers might have been unaware that paladins couldn't use piercers. We probably won't give them that ability, but we should address the fact that they cannot use these weapons. <br><br>We're doing a weapons search to see what weapons out there are actually usable by Paladins so that we can correct any discrepancies.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052729.html"><b>I can attack 72 times in one second, what do you think of that?</b></a><br>The test department took a look at this just to see what would happen. We were concerned about the possibility of a potential loop. <br><br>No one takes any damage when this happens, but it doesn't loop.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049304.html"><b>Robe of Living Fungus - Nerf or Bug?</b></a><br>I've asked around here, spoken to everyone with the ability to make or modify items, and can't find any indication that the robe ever had that effect. The closest thing I can guess is that we might have had a bad item export at some time that went live. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052301-3.html"><b>Rogues Picking off Spells</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Rogues pickpocketing spells off of Kunark mobs Please fix this so it's not possible to pickpocket spells]</i> <br><br>As infrequently as pickpocket will get an item, and as infrequently as the creatures drop spells, and considering that there's no way to tell when killing it that it has a spell, I really don't see a need to eliminate this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052104.html"><b>Spell Droppings</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please try that again where you find a place you know spells SHOULD be dropping and kill 250mobs to see how many scrolls you got just like you did before..... Please! I beg you....]</i> <br><br>I did last night, and saw a good number more drops.

It's nice to see someone spend this much time on a positive post. We really appreciate the opinions. It's a nice outlook. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: What are your thoughts on no_drop? Am I missing an important reason why no_drop should still be in game for all but the most uber/critical items?]</i> <br><br>NODROP was originally created with the intent of requiring that someone be at a specific event in order to reap the benefits of it. Quest items are a good example of what NODROP was intended for. We also expanded upon this initial design as an anti-farming measure. <br><br>Of course, with all of the new lands, items, areas, creatures, etc., that Kunark brought to the table, and with the introduction of contextual random loot, the need for anti-farming measures is decreasing. Most of the items in Kunark are not NODROP unless part of some quest. <br><br>We probably won't, however, go about removing the NODROP tags from existing items.</UL>

I received the following notice from VanZant:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings All,<br><br>On Thursday, May 15th, the Crimson Dragons guild on Fennin Ro hosted their<br>1st Annual Newbie Gnome Race.  The Race was started at the entrance to the<br>city of Ak'Anon and ended at the gates of Halas.  Over twenty-five members<br>of the Crimson Dragons guild created 1st level gnome characters of any class<br>and raced this tremendous distance.  None of the racers were allowed to use<br>any type of speed increasing buffs or buffs such as invisibility and<br>levitate that help to avoid creatures.  Teleports were not allowed, nor were<br>high level escorts.  Binding in cities along the way was permitted.<br><br>After the start at Ak'Anon, the stampede of newbie gnomes rushed through<br>Faydwer and boarded the ship at the docks in Butcherblock.  After much<br>singing, merriment and the spreading of sheer terror to the Ocean of Tears<br>population, the gnomish hordes spilled out onto the Freeport Docks and began<br>their frenzied rush to Halas.  Out of twenty-fave racers, only five gnomes<br>were able to complete the extremely difficult course.  Kilkin Cobblepot came<br>in first place, followed shortly by Taldor Fizzalot and Tahnlu Freestyler in<br>second and third.  The three victorious gnomes were awarded several flasks<br>of brandy and graciously drank themselves into unconciousness on the Halas<br>pier!<br><br>Congrats to all racers for an extremely amusing event!  Please feel free to<br>visit the Crimson Dragons website at <a href="http://www.crimson-dragons.com">http://www.crimson-dragons.com</a> for<br>pictures and details about the event!<br><br>Take Care,<br>VanZant BraveSword<br>Warrior of the 50th Season<br>Crimson Dragons Guild Leader</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks VanZant!

The following news post contains two observations about the patch that was recently implemented.  Here's the first report:<BLOCKQUOTE>The casting time for Donal's Arms of Mourning (effect: Valor) was doubled, to 12 seconds. Verant "forgot" to mention this in the patch info today. I thought is was important to know. More info can be found here, on the EQcleric boards: <br><br><a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003269.html">http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003269.html</a><br> <br>Arturum<br>Bilge Hunter</BLOCKQUOTE>Here's a second report:<BLOCKQUOTE>I was pleased to see that in last patch they did not say but did Slash prices on Alchemy. They are now Half the old price.<br><br>For example where it used to cost 10p5g to make a sow potion it now costs 4p2g5s. All herbs in FV were cut in half but this is as far as I could check will be checking on rest tonight.<br><br>Katerin soon to be wife of Acidic Maarr<br>Level 51 Divine Shaman</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks guys!

Another very positive <a href="http://www.electricgames.com/reviews/e/everquestrok.html">review of Kunark</a> was posted at Electric Games.  The final score awarded to RoK is 4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars.  Here's the bottom line:<UL>The Ruins of Kunark adds about 33% more land content to Everquest, a new playable race, the ability to achieve character levels above the previous limit, and a ton of new spells, monsters, items, and quests. The graphics in the new zones are incredibly detailed and show off all new effects. The expansion is more difficult than the original game, but still worth a look by new customers. 200,000+ subscribed players (even though a minority of them complain very loudly) is an impressive number and shows how addictive this game can be. </UL>Thanks RHFactor!
