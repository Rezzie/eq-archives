Aegana sent the following tip:<BLOCKQUOTE>Just a quick note for all EQ'ers that have a problem with the <br>spell wear off color and the non-melee damage color.  You can <br>change your eqclient.ini and make line #28 for "Hit for <br>non-melee" and line 29 "Spell worn off" to R = 255, G = 255, <br>and B = 0 to make it bright yellow again.  Also, I am including <br>a copy of the new line assignments that came off of the <br>eqnews.txt when we downloaded the last patch.<br> <br>*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<br> <br>If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with <br>default values. If an<br> <br>entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with <br>default values.<br> <br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text <br>colors in the client. All colors<br> <br>are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. <br>Valid settings for each color<br> <br>range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) <br>will be white in overlay mode,<br> <br>and black in normal mode.<br> <br>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the <br>file:<br> <br> 1 - Say<br> 2 - Tell<br> 3 - Group<br> 4 - Guild<br> 5 - OOC<br> 6 - Auction<br> 7 - Shout<br> 8 - Emote<br> 9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>16 - Disciplines or special abilities<br>17 - Unused at this time<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>19 - Unused at this time<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br>27 - yell for help<br>28 - Hit for non-melee<br>29 - Spell worn off<br>30 - Money splits<br>31 - Loot message<br>32 - Unused at this time<br> <br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the <br>client.

Gordon stated he had too many espressos last night as he went on an early morning binge posting on the Gameplay Board.  As always, here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006187.html"><b>Gordon: What are you doing up this late?</b></a><br>I made the mistake of indulging in one-too-many espressos when I got home this evening.

You'll have to rely either on what they say or the return from /con.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006186.html"><b>"Why can I not see my fire ball when I cast "Fire Bolt"?"</b></a><br>We moved missle creation server-side recently. That probably has something to do with the problem. I'll look into it Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006134.html"><b>Rogues Killing Greenies: Playing Nice?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Where do the rogues stand on the play nice issue of killing multiple green mobs to obtain poison components.<br><br>I'm asking because a player complained they were going to report me for killing greens that would have granted them EXP. I didn't kill steal any mobs they attacked but i didn't really leave much for em to kill.]</i></font> <br><br>Unless there's something more to this to which I am not privy, there's generally no problem with you killing whatever you wish providing that you aren't stealing the kills.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006166.html"><b>Corpse Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why in world is there a zone line that leads to instant death and an almost unrecoverable corpse?]</i></font> <br><br>The corpse is not unrecoverable. You can zone into the "preferred" entrance to the Hole and get a necro to summon your corpse. <br><br>As for why it's like this, that is just how the Hole is designed, and your death is the price of the knowledge that there might be a better way to go about what you are trying. Many things in EverQuest have to be learned, and are likely to cause death until they are. You should enter new areas cautiously until you learn how general rules and physics apply there. <br><br>Falling into an instant death situation is really no different than turning a corner and finding an NPC against which you have no chance given your current group makeup. Things of this nature need to be discovered and learned. <br><br>When the Hole first opened, we did put a short, somewhat vague, message in the patch message, since jumping in the Hole previously teleported people out to Toxxulia. The message was "GMs will not recover corpses for people who jump, fall, or levitate into the Hole". <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006179.html"><b>Bracer of Vajeen: Why can't Halflings wear it?</b></a><br>I'm not sure about this particular item, however if halflings were accidently excluded, we'll see about getting them put back on. I'll have to check into it on Monday. It's possible that they may have been purposely excluded.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006181.html"><b>"Why GM Events Don't Work"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: GM events have always involved killing something.]</i></font> <br><br>Not true. There have been many events that have taken place as stories to be witnessed and participated in. There have also been events where "killing something" has only been a very minor part of the event, rather than the central focus. Of course, we've always had the problem of getting people to refrain from killing the story-tellers, but we've taken steps to prevent that. Read below. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Who are the people in the game who can always kill something regardless of lvl? The lvl 50+s. So when you make a GM event and have most of the Mobs be around lvl 35, the people who are gonna kill them are 50+s.]</i></font> <br><br>The majority of events deal with actor npcs (npcs played by gms) rather than spawned NPCs (npcs that are still under the control of the servers). We've implemented the ability for the GMs to place a maximum level on who may attack them. That solves the majority of the problems that you cite. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As for risk vs. Reward, these lvl 55s have NO risk killing lvl 30 mobs, and are getting all this ph4+ l3w+.]</i></font> <br><br>Finally, I should mention that actor npcs hardly ever carry "phat lewt". We abolished that practice some months ago in order to avoid having the reward go whomever could kill the actor first.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006183.html"><b>"Ack! Too many spell book pages!"</b></a><br>Actually we're implementing a command that will let you flip to a specific page of your spell book.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005599.html"><b>Howling Stones & Dungeons</b></a><br>When dungeons or new areas are designed, they have to be implemented as if they always existed. As such, it's possible that the quest would "require" some bottom feeding by people who have already out-classed the dungeon where the quest components are located. However, someone who is in the process of building their character could very well happen across the components during normal adventuring.</UL>

Gordon kept the posts coming today on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the coverage of today's posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006053.html"><b>"Bring Down the Server and Fix This!"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I can't wait a week, as an enchanter I need to see when my Mez line of spells is resisted I got killed by wizards cuz someone in my group rooted some and I thought they were mezed, I can still mez with flux line of spells and remez but then it drains some cleric mana...]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry, but it wouldn't be appropriate of us to bring down the servers for a text-color issue. We'll get it fixed up next week, and I apologize for the difficulty that you'll have until then.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006058.html"><b>Blacksmithing Broken?</b></a><br>Hmmm, interesting. I'll forward this to Testing and the designer who's working on this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006063.html"><b>Risk Vs. Reward</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Now, I know Abashi will disagree with my opinion, but this suggests to me that Verant's calculation of risk vs reward is slightly out of whack.]</i></font> <br><br>How so? Some people prefer the game to be the same (cf. predictable) all of the time, others would get excited at the prospect of something different happening. I think that there are more people of the second type. <br><br>If I find a quote saying: <br><br>"Here's a general hint, when some "role-playing" sort of text scrolls across your screen from somewhere, and you're deep in the dungeon recuperating from a bad fight, heal up quick, because something fun, exciting, and different is about to happen." <br><br>...would that suggest that our calculation of risk vs reward was in line? <br><br>People have differing ideas of what constitutes risk, and what a reasonable reward for that risk is. This guy had two deaths, so he's upset. Some other might have two deaths and be happy for the reward of even being able to participate, as most haven't had that opportunity. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006064.html"><b>Inconsistant Logic?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Be consistant in your logic and put paladin and sk AC on Kunark armor where it belongs. Half way inbetween cleric and warrior. As it is on quest armor as it is on Plane armor.]</i></font> <br><br>Our logic is consistant. Warriors have the best armor. Everyone else's armor is lesser. Clerics are a plate wearing class. Their AC cannot be the same as warriors due to the fact that warriors have the best armor, therefore their's is as strong as hybrids. <br><br>I think that your misconception is that "Paly/SK armor is as weak as cleric armor", where in truth, "Cleric armor is as strong as Paly/SK armor". There's a subtle difference in those two statements. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006052.html"><b>Roleplaying</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why must Roleplayers be Anonymous?<br><br>Personally, I think anonymity hinders roleplaying. It forces you to have OOC discussions about your class and level. I (and many others I have met) would use the /roleplay flag to indicate my preference for roleplaying if it did not hide my class and level. I'm not saying that all roleplayers need be non-anon, just let us use the /anon command to choose that separately.]</i></font> <br><br>Interesting point. I think that the idea comes from the standpoint that roleplayers feel that they should have to introduce themselves to others. I can see however how awkward it might bee for two people to get together and try to decide if they can hunt together without using OOC communication. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: /roleplay - turns your name purple, identifies you as a roleplayer<br>/anon - hides your class, race and level<br>/showguild ON/OFF - hides your guild affiliation]</i></font> <br><br>I like your suggestions, however were we to implement them, do you think that the request would be followed up with requests to further seperate the hiding of race vs. class vs. location vs. level? <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006027.html"><b>Posting Downsides</b></a><br>It's occurred to be over the past two weeks that there's a big downside to the posting restrictions here on the boards. You can see it when you read most of the threads here on the board, and espicially so when reading the discussion threads thrown up over the past day or two. <br><br>It used to be very easy to find posts in need of a reply. It was easy to go through and toss out post after post on the basis of it being flame-ridden, insulting, or generally obnoxious. Now, it's much more difficult. There's too much worthy content here to comment on :)<br><br>I'm glad to see that the board changes are working out so well, and apologize if your post goes unanswered amongst the plethora of good content here these days. I'd also like to extend thanks to everyone for helping clean these boards up :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006032.html"><b>Clipping Plane</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Brad promised me it would get fixed after Kunark was released. Then later he said "we're working on it" and now months later its still not fixed!]</i></font> <br><br>Darkmatter, <br><br>What Brad promised is that he understood what the claim was and that we'd look into it. At no point have we agreed that there is a problem. The screenshots that were posted only show that the when the rain turns off, the fog moves out past the max clipping plane for an instant, then back in. This isn't indicative of there being any problem with the way that the plane works. Many zones have clips that are determined by the area. For instance, Toxxulia Forrest has a max clipping plane that is pretty close because we wanted the zone to appear eerie. <br><br>We're still looking into the issue, but it's not the highest of priorities at this time. The most likely "fix" will be for us to make it so that the plane doesn't extend beyond max when the rain turns off. The net result of this fix is basically nothing, which is why it's not a high priority at the moment. We have already confirmed that the min/max clipping plane boundaries are indeed set to the appropriate limits.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006034.html"><b>Item Enscriptions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is there a way we can inscribe lore items with sayings? like "Happy Birthday?" I mean it would be fun. I know this was brought up before and Gordon realized people would abuse it to use profanity. To prevent this it can force the player's name who scribed it to be at the bottom and a hidden "watermark" that only GMs can activate that tell that players station name and acct.number. This way GMs can issue a scribal warning to the player, 2nd offense means 24 hour suspension, 3rd offense 72 hours, and so on.]</i></font> <br><br>We like the idea of "markable" items, however EQ's item architecture does not support it. Items are stored in character files as a number that points back to a global entry in the database. The item itself is actually a reference to an object, rather than a copy of the object itself. <br><br>It's part of the core architecture and not something that we can modify in the existing game going forward.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006021.html"><b>Guild Housing</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My Guild seems to have this notion that Guild Houses will be implimented in November-ish (possibly Velios?), and will cost about 50k pp.]</i></font> <br><br>We have no plans to implement any type of purchasable or rentable housing in EQ at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006008.html"><b>Monk Nerf?</b></a><br>It wasn't a monk nerf, but you are correct in that the fix to the attack speed debuff problem is what caused it. Sometimes fixes have both positive and negative consequences. Attack speed debuffs will always overwrite haste spells now.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006018.html"><b>"Fair is Fair"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: empty handed<br> last time i looked erudites couldn't be monks. Now I'm swinging away with my enameled blackened mace and when i hit her hahahaha I hit her for 10 if I was lucky. Needless to say she killed me pretty good. My ac is above average for my level 450 aprox can't remember the exact number.]</i></font> <br><br>In EverQuest, with exception of one character model (spectre), any creature that has a visible weapon will drop that weapon when killed. It's actually loot upon the creature. Since we don't want to load weapons on every NPC capable of wielding them due to the effect on the economy, NPCs that are unarmed will still have a good damage capabilities regardless of their class. <br><br>See the section of the FAQ that talks about NPCs having special abilities.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006007.html"><b>Boss Frog Camped to Death</b></a><br>Well, given that item creation has to remain constant, the problem remains that people feel that *need* a particular item to be competative. Pre-Kunark, there were frequently warriors on this board claiming that they couldn't get into a group unless they were dual-wielding SSoY's. Given that they feel that they *need* a particular item, they feel that they are then *forced* to camp it until they get it. <br><br>Your example in this case would extend "Camp till I get it" times, upsetting those who decide that they *need* the item and are going to do whatever they have to until they get it. It would, however, throw an "unexpected benefit", however rare, on other frogs in the area. <br><br>I think that your suggestion works as long as people don't feel that they *absolutely need* the item. However, once they feel that they do, it breaks down.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005973.html"><b>Summon Spell</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You know, a lot of the melee class complaints that Verant claims can be helped by grouping would decrease greatly if a mid-level spell was added for wizards and perhaps mages that allowed them to summon other group members to them across the world.<br><br>That way, if a melee class player died in combat, they could be summoned back to the combat area]</i></font> <br><br>Clerics and high level paladins already have the ability to summon fallen comrades back to the combat area, via resurrection.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005951.html"><b>"Why do rogues have to stop attacking to evade and pick pockets?"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why do rogues have to stop attacking to evade and pick pockets?  Is there any reason for this feature?]</i></font> <br><br>Balance. It's so there's a downside to performing either action.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon started a sub topic for the recent debate he began on the Gameplay Board.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005902.html">the post he made</a>:<UL><I>I've noticed that many of the responses to the thread "why camp" still suggest randomizing loot, beyond that which is present in Kunark. Certainly in Kunark, we've been trying contextual randomness (randomness that makes sense in the environment) on good loot, while leaving the best loot on standard "boss" NPCs. We've been fairly happy with the results, as it allows the casual player a good chance to pick up loot that will work for their class without "requiring" them to camp.<br><br>Still, many continue to suggest that we further randomize loot. I'd like to map out an example that shows why this isn't always the best answer. I think that the biggest misconception that I see here in regards to random loot is that the items will be more available. This isn't the case, as we still need to control the rate at which items enter the world. Randomizing loot isn't going to cause this rate to increase. <br><br>Let's say that CoolItem has a 20% chance to drop off of BossFrog in Lower Guk, who spawns 100% of the time on a 20 minute timer. This means that in two hours (six spawns, assuming he were killed instantly after spawning, which is close enough to the case), the frog would have just under a 74% chance of dropping CoolItem at least once. A group choosing to camp BossFrog would have a pretty good chance of getting 1 item in two hours.<br><br>Now, lets say that it was random. We can't increase the overall rate that CoolItem enters the world. So lets say that we give 20 frogs (still on a 20 minute timer) a 1% chance of dropping the item. Anyone care to guess how many of *these* frogs you have to kill to have the same 74% chance of getting the item? 135. Assuming the dungeon was completely camped, and that you could only kill one frog every 20 minutes, it would take 45 hours to have a 74% chance of getting the item. Suppose the dungeon isn't that crowded and you can take a whole room with 4 frogs in it every 20 minutes, it would still take 135 frogs to get that 74% chance, taking over 11 hours. The single-spawn 20% drop frog would have a 67% chance of dropping at least 6 during that time.<br><br>This same logic follows for suggestions that have the creature spawn in any number of random locations. If we have 20 places that BossFrog spawns, on a 1% spawn, and give him a 100% chance of dropping the item, we're still at 135 Frogs to get that 74% chance of him spawning. <br><br>As you can see, the level of randomness that some people are suggesting would create more frustration than people currently cite. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

More posts to report tonight that Gordon made on the Gameplay Board today:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005762.html"><b>Multiple Copies of Zones</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This would be great, end camping, end reserve dates for planes, and the play nice rules would cease cause there would be nothin to complain about.]</i></font> <br><br>It would only really "end camping" to the extent that "giving everyone their own NPC to camp" ends camping. It might end lists, but it wouldn't really end camping. It would have the effect of blowing up the game economy. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why again can't Verant make it so that there are multiple copies of a zone?]</i></font> <br><br>We "can't" due to the server load that maintaining a dynamically generated zones would require. There would also be problems for people who wanted to "meet up" in a dungeon, as they would have a hard time getting in the same copy. <br><br>It is, however, closer to the point that we "won't", due to its overall impact upon the game. Everyone exists in the same world, and it is that world that we have to manage. Multiple copies of zones would cause the world to dynamically fluctuate in size and content making it impossible to manage.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005760.html"><b>Particle Graphic Changed?</b></a><br>That's strange. I've also never seen any effects while it [particle effects] was set to off. If you have any further info, I'd be happy to look into it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005739.html"><b>Request From a Charity Buffer</b></a><br>That's a good thought. I'll mention it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005755.html"><b>Two Weapons and a Shield?</b></a><br>You aren't dual-wielding with the weapon in the ranged slot, it just shows up when you put it in. It's the same thing that causes a bow to magically appear when shooting an arrow. The character using the bow won't switch back to melee weapons until he's in melee range and initiates an attack.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005727.html"><b>Character Missing</b></a><br>There was a bug that allowed this to happen at one time under very special circumstances, but that was corrected 6 or 7 months ago. Let me ask, were you moved from one of the other servers to Druzzil?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005452.html"><b>Trolls & Ogres</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So what I am proposing is, that Trolls have a larger set of racial abilities and hence Ogres are not in balance. Especially when regen is factored in, which makes soloing more practical.]</i></font> <br><br>As other people have mentioned here, ogres also cannot be stunned from the front. Strength and stamina is also significantly higher than in trolls. Troll stats are more in line with the barbarian in that regard. Finally, it's fairly well known that trolls require more experience to level than ogres. As mentioned in the FAQ, though differing experience requirements can't be traded directly for primary balance components, they do help buffer things such as racial abilities.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005479.html"><b>Magicians Pets Too Powerful?</b></a><br>I agree that pets are a bit too powerful at level 50, however since we've reduced their power at least 3 times since release, we're a little apprehensive about doing so further. Instead we reduced the amount of the gain in power from 50 to 60 for those pets, both magician and necro. At 60th level, their power is about right where they should be for that level. <br><br>One thing that I do want to note here is that though the pets are a bit too powerful at 50th, it doesn't create a "balance" issue in the greater sense of the word. The power of those pets does not invalidate the need for other classes in the group. For instance, you never see someone ooc, "group looking for tank or mage/necro with pet for Sebilis run". There's also issues in the game that often make pets more dangerous to have than not. These issues serve to balance the pets, though they are powerful in one-on-one combat. Players on the PvP servers will note that their pets do less damage in PvP combat. This is for the reason just mentioned.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005576-2.html"><b>Monks and Parry Skill</b></a><br>Yes, you are correct, monks don't parry. I was just rattling off defensive skills and slipped that one in accidentally.</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005765.html">started a discussion</a> on camping today's on the Gameplay Board.  Here's what he said:<UL><i>I had a thought earlier and figured we could have a bit of a discussion about camping. Now before everyone jumps in and says, "because the game forces you to", let's agree that for whatever reason, people decide to camp. Perhaps so many people are camping that newcomers feel that they have to camp, but you still have to make that choice: Am I going to camp or am I going to adventure?  Perhaps the game encourages it by rewarding camping. If that is the case, wouldn&#8217;t the logical solution be to remove those rewards? More on this later&#8230;<br><br>So here's some questions:<br><br>1. Why camp?<br><br>Is it because you feel it is more profitable? Is it more profitable to sit in an overcrowded dungeon fighting over spawns and being on loot lists than moving out into the lesser-used areas of the world? I'm reminded of a recent Kunark review where the reviewer, an avid EverQuest player, indicated that there's more than enough room in Kunark to go off someplace with a group, but he couldn't get his group to do anything but sit in one area and camp a spawn.<br><br>2. Why not spread out to some of the lesser-used areas?<br><br>This question will inevitably bring about discussions of bindpoints, risk, reward, etc, or talk about how loot "sucks" in other areas. However, at the same time it begs the question, why do people choose to do something that they find boring and without challenge. Again I ask, is loot in any unused area really worse than what you'll get by camping a crowded dungeon, fighting over spawns, and being on a list? Certainly risk is less, but risk is essentially a small amount of experience in a well-balanced group. Do you feel that there is more net gain in the crowded dungeons? Can two groups taking turns killing 3 critters that spawn every 20 minutes in a room really be more profitable than going off someplace on your own, even given increased risk?<br><br>3. Do you actually enjoy camping? <br><br>There are people who do, and I'd like to get an impression of how many people honestly prefer camping. We've made several changes in the past few months to make camping less profitable, leading to a slew of complaints from this group, so I know that they are out there.<br><br>4. What do you propose should be done?<br><br>Some say that random loot tables are the only way to stop camping, but people don't just camp loot, they camp experience as well. We've all seen people move through the game staking out solitary 6 minute spawns for the purpose of camping experience. <br><br>Keep in mind that anything you suggest has to scale to 2K people online per server, all trying to do the same quest.<br><br>---opinion---<br>My feeling is that people camp because they feel it is more profitable, whatever "profitable" means to them. I personally consider "having fun" to be "profitable", to an extent greater than getting experience or loot. I won't go in certain dungeons because they are camped. I enjoy places where you zone in and you might be the only group there. Other people however often value loot and experience over fun, or believe that they can only have fun by acquiring loot or experience. Some people feel that they can only go have fun once they've acquired all of the loot and experience that they'll ever need. <br><br>I really don't think that random loot is an option for loot-camping, as people will still pick a spawn to camp and kill there until they get the item. Certainly, it won't lead to everyone camping the same NPC, but will still result in all of the NPCs being camped. I feel that as long as there exists the relative assurance that "If I spend enough time in this one area, I will sooner or later get the item". <br><br>As far as experience camping goes, I feel we can only get rid of it if we make it less profitable than other things people could do. Perhaps if we could programmatically detect XP camping, we could put something in to counter it. We've been adjusting spawn times that were set incorrectly on some NPCs in the world, causing them to spawn too rapidly, leading to it being a profitable camp, but what else do you think that we should do?<br>---opinion---<br><br>My last question is:<br><br>5. If we do whatever is necessary to get rid of camping, by making it less profitable, how many people will that *really* upset?<br><br>People camp because it's easier, faster, safer, and more profitable to do so than to move through areas and do something more exciting. People dislike camping because it's boring (without challenge), yet this situation is created by it being easier, faster, safer, and more profitable. Completely randomizing loot will only make more NPCs worthy of camping, not reduce the amount of camping going on. <br><br>Logic suggests that if people camp because it&#8217;s easier, faster, safer, and more profitable, the way to stop camping would be to make it harder, slower, more risky, and less profitable. Yet, any time we've done that with an aspect of the game, it creates a *large* number of upset people here on the boards. If we make something harder, we're trying to eliminate soloing. If we make it slower, we're trying to hurt the casual gamer. If we make it more risky, we're trying to make you die more, which is supposed to make you play longer and pay us more. If we make it less profitable, we're trying to force everyone to join uberguilds. <br><br>In all honesty, any time we&#8217;ve made something harder, slower, more risky, and less profitable, we&#8217;ve been trying to motivate people to play the game in a manner that we would consider more fun. Should we stop trying to do that? If yes, should we stop trying to address camping? <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Gordon posted to the Gameplay Board to add some things to the patch message that was implemented today:<UL>Since the original one this morning, we've put up another. Here's the text:<br><br>***Character Purge***<br><br>Time has come to do some cleanup on character data across the servers. On August 23rd (Pacific), we will be doing a system-wide cleanup of level 1 characters. All level 1 characters that have not been played within 30 days from the date of the purge wil<br>l be deleted. As GMs will not be able to restore any characters that are deleted, please be certain to log in any level 1 characters that you wish to keep prior to the purge.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br>August 17th, 2:00pm<br>------------------------<br><br>*Updated Patch Message*<br><br>Some additional changes were included in today's patch that were not listed in the patch <br>message earlier today. This patch message is a replacement for the one posted earlier:<br><br>*Miscellaneous Changes*<br><br>- /trackplayers now supports a "GROUP" option, allowing trackers to exclude all player <br>characters, except ones in their current group.<br>- The EQCLIENT.INI has some new features, including one allowing logging (/log) to be on by <br>default. Updated documentation for the EQCLIENT.INI file is at the end of this patch <br>message.<br>- Activatable items, such as Journeyman's Boots, can now be activated by the corresponding <br>number-key if placed in a hotbox.<br>- Items that are "out of charges" now display "Charges: None" when inspecting the item.<br>- Attack-speed buffs and debuffs will now stack correctly. In other words, lower level <br>spells will no longer overwrite higher level spells of the same type.<br>- The "U" key (short for "use") has had its functionality enhanced. It now does the <br>equivalent of a single left-click and single right-click at the center of the screen. In <br>addition to opening doors, it will now consider and inspect PCs, consider NPCs, and use <br>bankers, merchants, and guildmasters.<br>- Fixed the way that spell-effect icons are displayed on the UI. Previously, after adding <br>several "buffs" to a character, one of the icons would be placed down in the chat window. <br><br>*Chat/Login Server*<br><br>This patch contains eqmain.dll, which is used by the EverQuest login/chat frontend. The <br>following changes have been implemented:<br><br>- #help now accepts arguments. #help #command will return help for the requested command.<br>- Errors issued within the chat/login server frontend now display an "Error Number". Please <br>have this error number ready when requesting technical assistance.<br><br>*Looking for Group Flag*<br><br>Players can now indicate that they are "looking for a group" by typing /LFG. This command <br>will flag your character in both zone-specific /who lists, and the server-wide "/who all" <br>list with "LFG". The LFG flag will remain active until you either enter a group or log out. <br>Players can search for other players who are LFG by using filters in the /who command. For <br>instance, to find rangers between level 40 and 50 who are looking for a group across the <br>server, type "/who all ranger 40 50 lfg". <br><br>It is our hope that this flag will make it easier for players to seek out group members, <br>allowing for more adventuring with less preparation time.<br><br>*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<br><br>If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values. If an <br>entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with default values.<br><br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors <br>are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color <br>range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, <br>and black in normal mode. <br><br>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file:<br><br>1 - Say<br>2 - Tell<br>3 - Group<br>4 - Guild<br>5 - OOC<br>6 - Auction<br>7 - Shout<br>8 - Emote<br>9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>16 - Disciplines or special abilities<br>17 - Unused at this time<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>19 - Unused at this time<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br>27 - yell for help<br>28 - Hit for non-melee<br>29 - Spell worn off<br>30 - Money splits<br>31 - Loot message<br>32 - Unused at this time<br><br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is a list of valid <br>settings:<br><br>RunMode - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<br>ScreenMode - NORMAL for the dafault window view, FULL for the full view with overlays<br>Log - TRUE for logging on, FALSE for logging off<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Platt sent along some interesting comments regarding today's weird login screen:<BLOCKQUOTE>This login was actually around in phase .5 of Everquest (March 97 or so) at that time only one EQ server existed so it was unnecessary to have the splash screen/chat server etc.<br> <br>In my opinion it is rather odd that they waited 3 years to bring it back since its a great addition in my opinion.

Rowyl, one of the EQ Live team's Senior Programmers, started a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003400.html">discussion thread on the Gameplay Board</a> about EverQuest's User Interace (also known as UI).  Here's post #1 in this long thread:<UL><i>My name is Roy, and I am a Senior Programmer on the EQ Live team. My main focus for now is the client program including the User Interface.<br><br>Some of the first things I've done are now live and I've seen the many reactions to them. I've been reading the boards and even implemented some of the suggestions already (they will go onto test tonight or tomorrow).<br><br>Be aware that while I am reading the boards, I can not respond to everything. I will read what I can, and respond when I can. If I were to spend the time needed to reply to everything, then I would not have any time to code the changes and fixes needed. My boss would not be too happy with me, if that were the case...<br><br>Hopefully, we can work together to make the UI as good as it can be.</I></UL>Here's post #2:<UL><I>Albrecht_Hammerfell: having more then 8 spells from your spell book available to cast at any one time is NOT part of EQ<br><br>-ArchAngelis-: Log control has been added to the eqclient.ini file already, should be on test soon.<br><br>Others: as has been said, I am primarily working on the UI, I won't be addressing issues such as class balance and problems with quests or items.<br><br>-Rowyl</i></UL>Here's post #3:<UL><I>Using activatable items from the hotbutton panel is in and should be on test. I'm looking into why the hotkeys don't operate from a keypress while in the spell book.<br>---<br>Looking into the Ctrl-1 thru Ctrl-8 for memed spells.<br>---<br>The main issue with selecting party members pets with the F keys is that the client doesn't currently track the info. I will look into it and see if this can be done. As usual, no promises.<br>---<br>Looking into the shift click while buying to buy stacks of 20. One thing to keep in mind, if you don't have enough money for all 20 it will just cancel the sale. This will only work on stackable items.<br>---<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. When emoting, the text of the emote YOU typed used to be blue. But when others saw it, it was white. Similarly, when you saw other's emotes, they were white. Now all emotes are the same color.]</i></font> <br>I had to make "classes" of text, and in order to keep it from being a separate color control entry in the ini file <br>for every text message printed (meaning hundreds of entries) I had to group stuff together. I thought it made sense <br>to put all emotes into a class together. This reason applies to alot of the messages. <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. With my color User_11 RGB as specified in Gordon's file, full red only, the text is still WHITE on messages where others are hitting me. This is probably just a bug.<br>3. Wasn't the duel color (User_14) yellow?<br>Some of the messages are sent from the server with a color tag, I have already fixed most of these and it should be on test. <br>4. Was all spell activity really dark blue? I must be losing my marbles, that seems wrong.]</i></font> <br><br>See my responce to 1 above. <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. When you do a /who friend all, your friends list comes back white, rather than the color of all other friends queries (again, likely just a bug).]</i></font> <br>The "local" /who command is handled by the client, the "/who all" commands are all handled by the world server. Those will be colored properly soon.</I></UL>Here's post #4:<UL><I>Just a note, hotkeying a backback slot is just not possible.<br><br>-Rowyl</i></UL>Here's post #5:<UL><i>Couple things I wanted to address:<br><br>Cancelling a spell you already cast and having to wait until the casting time is done is part of the game. If you click the wrong spell you have to wait... <br><br>I doubt I will be able to increase the number of hotbuttons per page above 6 pages of 6 buttons. It would change the player data format stored ont he server, and that could cause serious problems with character data. I might be able to make it 4 pages of 9 (still having a total of 36 buttons, just more available at a time). I am still investigating this one.. I'll let you know what comes up.<br><br>Several of the other things asked for here are either in or going in this week. Like a /cast 1-8 for casting memmed spells, /book # to open your book on page #, /sit, /doability # (so if you have tracking set on ability button 1, then /doability 1 would invoke tracking), more control of certain text message colors, the spell and target being mentioned in the "casting" message, custom emotes that include the target name (/em gives @ the look of death and @ is frozen in his tracks would replace the '@' with the current target), and more... some of these are on test already, and some will be there later this week.<br><br>-Rowyl</i></UL>Here's post #6:<UL><i>Just to reply to the people that didn't like my reply about stopping spells.<br><br>It's part of the game. If you click the wrong spell, it's a penalty that you have to wait thru. I'm sorry that it's not the way you would like it, but there have to be drawbacks to making mistakes. And I realize that sometimes it's not a mistake so much as the situation changing after you cast.<br><br>I play a caster, and I would like to make this change, also, but it's just something I have control over. The designers of the game want it this way.<br><br>-Rowyl</I></UL>Here post #7:<UL><i>I am familiar with ShowEQ, and how it does it's pet stuff. The pet does have the ID of it's owner in it's packet, but player packets down't have the ID of their pet. What needs to be done is that the client needs to search the current mob database for any pets that belong to people in the current party. For your own pet it does this when you create it. The client also needs to keep updating this info as your party changes and as your party members create and destroy pets (either via pet spells or charm).<br><br>Again, ShowEQ is just going thru it's entire database and when if find s a pet it sticks it under the pets owner, but as I've explained above it's not the same as tracking the pets for the functionality asked for in this thread. That said, I still plan to look into this feature because I think it would be useful.<br><br>-Rowyl</i></UL>Here's post #8:<UL><I>Regarding the text box in higher resolutions.<br><br>One of the other programmers here is working on that right now. It's not as simple as one might think at first glance because users can and do switch modes back and forth (sometimes they are forced to by the game itself like for inventory mode), and thus the text needs to be "re-wrapped" for the narrower box when in that mode, and then expanded back out when you return to the higher res fullview. It's almost working though and should be on test later this week.<br><br>-Rowyl</I></UL>

Gordon has kept busy on the Gameplay Board this evening with several new posts made to address several issues.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005422.html"><b>Gordon "Again" Mistaken?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: b) Random loot table. With this system any mob at a given level range has a slight chance of droping a rare item for a given level range. You've shown you can do this somewhat. Level 1-7 mobs tend to drop rusties while 8-19 drop bronze and 20+ drop Fine Steel. So instead of camping X mob for X amount of time you "do" dungeons in the traditional fasion known as dungeon crawling. This would incourage more social interaction because caster's would get melee only items and melee would get caster only items. Thus you have a working trade system. How rare something actually is remains a unknown until a lot of the same item goes into circulation. Supply and demand will determine the trade price.]</i></font> <br><br>Loot tables are already somewhat random (or contextually random) for some good loot in Kunark, however, random loot for special quests just makes the quest meaningless. Quests have a story behind them, and that story is based off of who drops what, who give what info, and who fulfills the quest. It would be quite disappointing for a quest to just send someone in to randomly slay creatures in a particular area. <br><br>People camp quest items because they want the reward from the quest, and whatever it takes to be assured of getting that reward is worth the effort. Increasing the availability of that reward only reduces the amount that people want it. Camping only decreases in this case because people who want the item are then more likely to have it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon your sadly mistaken. ]</i></font><br><br>Is it just me or do a lot of posts here begin with this, or with "You've missed the point"?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005405.html"><b>Frustrated Warrior Vents</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why don't you start a group? It's a startling concept and one that most people never catch on to. I've been in zones where you'll see a wizard, shaman, warrior, and druid all yell at the same time for a group for like an hour and never once consider joining up to make their own group. It's pretty amusing when I see that. Just make one, it isn't that hard.]</i></font> <br><br>I've seen this several times myself. It's one of the things that I hope the LFG flag will address. If there's a bunch of people standing around in a zone looking for a group, existing groups should be able to see them and pick them up quickly, or they can form amongst themselves.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005440.html"><b>UI Fixes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: At the online game company I worked for (not verant), we experienced much the same thing. We had all the staffers working our heinies off to get the big stuff done, and it never seemed to end, with something else "big" always popping up that we'd have to deal with. But eventually we had it all in place, all the big stuff was working, and we could FINALLY move on to the secondary things we'd been shelving. <br><br>Looks like Verant has recently hit that same point. They have really changed gears in the last few weeks in particular, and are doing a lot of smaller things that I'm sure they were forced to put on the back burners. Remember the patch where they fixed a bunch of typos? That's a very low priority task. Or the text color changes in the latest patch? Again, low priority. <br><br>The fact that they are addressing low priority fixes (in spades, I might add) means that they are finally over the hump and the high priority project list has finally stopped increasing on a daily basis. ]</i></font><br><br>That's a very good description, so good in fact that I'm not sure what I can add to it. It is very nice to be able to go back and start addressing that "would be nice" list that has been building for some time. They often give good bang for the buck, but are often hard to justify when you have a lot of high priority things on the docket. <br><br>I'm glad that we're able to start working on some of the wonderful ideas that have been on the back burner for some time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005393.html"><b>Using Different Spells for Different Creatures</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Well, some creatures may have a lower resist to a certain spell type. So that is your reason to use certain spells over another.]</i></font> <br><br>Bingo. Thanks Fal.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005401.html"><b>Naming Pets</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just as a minor touch to the pet classes, could you implement a command that lets you change the name of the pet? Might be kinda fun to do. :-)]</i></font> <br><br>We couldn't allow people to choose the name of their own pet, as it would increase the number of naming issues by an order of magnitude. Also, changing the name of a pet after summoning isn't an option, due to the way that the zone keeps track of NPCs. The only possible change that we could even look into would be for people to choose an NPC name from a list of acceptable names, causing future pets to be named in that fashion, however something like this isn't likely to be prioritized anytime soon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005388.html"><b>Archery Bug/Nerf?</b></a><br>The problem regarding being unable to shoot an arrow after casting a spell is unintentional. The dev team is working on the issue and it should be fixed soon. The problem is occurring because we just moved some components of archery from the client to the server. This will let us do some neat things that we weren't able to do before. For instance, we can now place randomly triggered effects upon bows and have them work.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005369.html"><b>Group Mana Bars</b></a><br>We won't be displaying mana bars to everyone in the group. Hit point bars make sense as you should be able to tell by looking at someone how healthy they are.

Yes, I'll agree that some shiverback components are of lesser quality than some other non-planar items that are available, however, even so, the monk is as solid defensively as we want them to be. While one could argue that we should increase shiverback to a level that it's more powerful than the mundane stuff, one could also argue that we should lower the power of the mundane stuff and keep shiverback as it is. We're currently running defensive tests of all the melee classes to ensure that they end up in the list where we feel that they should fall. <br><br>The indication from the last tuning meeting was that a monk in full shiverback had enough defensive power as they should.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005358.html"><b>You Have Been Disconnected</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why cant it be made so that when I make water and I make food it will stay on my character for a 45 minutes or 30 is that so much to ask. I don't exactly like spending 10 minutes making food and water everytime I go LD and its even more irritating when your in a group fighting and you have to create food for yourself why they are in need of help]</i></font> <br><br>Summon food and items are intentionally less-reliable than "real" items of the same nature. It's one of the balancing factors for having them there to begin with. Now it was never the intention for people to lose them when accidently going LD, however LDs remain a part of life on the internet, and there's no way to determine the difference between an accidental and intentional LD. There was one time when we allowed people to keep summoned items for an LD, but had to change it when we noticed our LD logs increase exponentially for the purpose of keeping the summoned items. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There ought to be like a 30 minute timer before pets and summoned items automatically poof. This was the most promising of the threads.]</i></font> <br><br>Unfortunately, this isn't possible, as characters aren't in the world 30 minutes after they disappear. As long as characters are "in the world", the servers have to keep track of what they are doing and what is happening to them. Once they are removed from the world, they then do not exist. We can't age a timer for someone who is not in the world.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005148.html"><b>GM Faction Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: After speaking to a very nice GM by the name of Valdelmar, I was told that they STILL would not fix it, unless I was a wizard trying to do the Ice Comet quest.

A label, nothing else]</i></font> <br><br>I've addressed the idea of a "label, nothing else" before. Unfortunately, it has been shown that without enforcement, some aspects of the player community would not respect the label. <br><br>Take these boards as an example. Flames, name-calling, profanity, and general discourtesy has never been "allowed". In fact, rules prohibiting such conduct have always been part of the Station Terms of Service. However, since these rules were not enforced, it wasn't very long before the board was dominated by it's former problems. Only now, after we've expressly tied account status to the boards and enforced it by means of login restrictions have they started allowing for better discussions. <br><br>The same issue exists with the idea of an unenforced "roleplay only" server, and since the idea of an enforced roleplay-only server isn't feasible, it's not something that we can do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005301.html"><b>Long Q&A</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Is is possible to have armor and weapons be right clicked and have them appear directly on your body, instead of having to drag them to your inventory picture. This would help elliviate some of the time it takes to loot your own corpse. Backpacks and other items can be right clicked directly into inventory slots, so why can't equipment be right clicked directly on?]</i></font> <br><br>No, it used to be like this in early beta, but was purposefully changed to it's current state. It simulates some time necessary to reequip items, rather than having it more or less instantaneous. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Will we ever be able to use the hot buttons while meditating? I had read that this was being worked ]</i></font>on a while ago, but I wasn't sure if it was implemented. Also, will Hot buttons be able to be used on the Merchant Purchase screen as well (see the next question)?? <br><br>Maybe, it's on Roy's plate. There's no gameplay reason why we wouldn't allow it since we allow you to use them by clicking them with the mouse, so the only thing left is to see if there's some technical reason, and if not, to implement it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Will we ever be able to purchase multiple items at once (food, water, and trade skill items)?]</i></font> <br><br>See #2 above. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Is there a way to have food that will give temporary boosts to Ability scores? I think it would be cool to eat a piece of Bread of Stamina, or Mana Muffins. Is this possible to add to the game, if it isn't already a part of the Cooking skill?]</i></font> <br><br>This is not in our current plans, though we like the idea and will keep it in mind. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. Is there a way to increase the Hide/Sneak speed for Rogues??]</i></font> <br><br>Already in. Rogues above 50 sneak at progressivly faster speeds, until level 60 where they can sneak at a full run. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6. Why does sitting increase the aggro distance on enemies, especially green ones?]</i></font> <br><br>It really doesn't, however, sitting PCs are automatically added to the hate-list of any NPC in the awareness radius. Normally, an NPC that isn't mad at you, but would attack you anyway, becomes aware of you before they react to you. So, in other words, if the awareness radius is 200 ft, and the reaction radius is 100 ft, a wolf would attack a standing person once he crossed into reaction range. However, when the person is sitting, they are added to the hate list at the awareness range. The ranges themselves don't actually change. <br><br>This is intended. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7. Why is it that Monsters have the ability to turn around immediately?]</i></font> <br><br>See the FAQ.

Where stunning creatures goes (like above with bash), how come players never know when they have actually stunned creatures?]</i></font> <br><br>There is a text message indicates this. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why do the monsters stun and sometimes cause cahracters to spin?]</i></font> <br><br>Because being stunned allows the player to make no further inputs for the duration of the stun. As such, any turn that you've begun, will continue while stunned. You'll never get spun if you are simply facing the creature. You only get spun if you are turning at the time you are stunned. I've always thought that this was a neat effect. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 10. Why is it that monsters don't have to follow the same rules of hit detection that players have to conform to??

I have noticed that small races sometimes have problems climbing onto ledges, when exiting the water from swimming. This is especially true for the Halas zone, where my Halfling has to try numerous times to get out of the water at both ledges. Often while trying to climb onto the ice near the Halas dock, I will fall (for 1 pt of dmg) under the ledge, and then be under the water in front of the ledge. Usually I have this happen four or five times to try and get up the ledge. Is this a known problem?]</i></font> <br><br>It's a known problem, and unfortunately cannot be fixed without man-months of work on each zone (basically rebuilding each one from scratch) followed by excessively long downloads. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 12. The bugs involved with boat trips? I am sure I don't need to mention the numerous bugs associated with the boats, especially having to do with characters appearing to be swimming and sharks appearing ON the boat. Have these been looked at. A friend of mine said that he had seen a response that in order to fix these the whole zone would have to be redone. Is this true? Or, is there a remedy in the works?]</i></font> <br><br>Sharks appearing on the boats is not a bug, but a consequence of the design. As for other boat related issues, you'll have to list them one by one. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 13. The zone doors in some zones are ridiculously small, and this can often cause people to "get stuck" while zoning, and cause them to be sent back through the zone the other way.

Has anyone else noticed a lack of Guides/GMs during late night hours? I usually play from 1am EST till about 6am EST daily, and usually it is rare to see one Guide on at that time, if any at all.]</i></font> <br><br>We're always working to improve coverage in the off-hours. We just moved a bunch of GMs around to fill that area better. As for Guides, they are players just like yourselves. We take every opportunity to recruit off-hours guides and do the best we can in that area. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 15. This question driectly relates to #14 above. I myself tried to appply to be a Guide using the re-designed form that was announced last week. I logged in and created a password for the guide program, and then began filling out the questionaire. I was about half way done filling it out, when because of pressing issues at work I decided to finish it later. I had never atually submitted the form, but when I tried to log in again and fill it out, it said I had already submitted a form. I would still like to try and fill it out again, but it continues to say that someone with my account name has already filled out a Guide application. I would hate to have to wait until the next form comes out some months from now to try and apply again. I also seem to remember this same problem with the last guide app I tried to submit.]</i></font> <br><br>When filling out the guide account, it only allows a station name to be entered once in order to prevent multiple applications submitted by the same person. What most likely happened in this case, is that the application was read as completed and submitted for grading.<br><br><br>If a situation such as this occurs, the applicant may write appadmin@verant.com and supply the station name and email address used when filling out the application and ask that we delete it so they may resubmit. If they wish to wait, the application will go into the queue to be graded and will fail as incomplete and once the database is purged of failed applications they will be able to resubmit the application. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 16. Whe will we be able to purchase only the Kunark upgrade through a version of the online store again??]</i></font> <br><br>Last I heard we've about gotten all of the bugs worked out. The plan is to provide a web-based utility to allow separate purchase of Kunark. We'll release more information in regards to this when we have it. I'm sorry that I don't have anything more for you now. </UL>
