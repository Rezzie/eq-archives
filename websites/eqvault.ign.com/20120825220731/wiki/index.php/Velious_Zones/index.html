						<p>The continent of Velious was introduced in The Scars of Velious expansion in December 2000.
</p><p>Before recorded time, Veeshan the great Crystalline Dragon marked Norrath by striking the continent of Velious with her foreclaw, and deposited her brood there to dwell. The legends of that time also tell that Veeshan blasted Velious with her breath, encasing it in eternal ice and creating a barrier of deadly ice flows and stormy weather. This marked the beginning of the Age of Scale. The Age of Scale lasted untold millennia. From the tidbits of information passed down, it is known that a group of dragons mastered magic and spellcasting during this era. Additionally, dragons of power and influence among their kind gathered together and formed a hereditary ruling council known as the Claws of Veeshan, who rule the dragons of Velious to this day. Few of Norrath’s inhabitants know more of this Age,and none that do would dare to speak. 
</p><p>The end of the Age of Scale was marked by the Gods creation of the other races of Norrath. Many of Veeshan’s vainglorious brood perceived that they might rule over these lesser beings and left Velious. This splinter group became known as the Ring of Scale. Those dragons that remained upon Velious had little interest in temporal power, and were content to pass the millennia in homage to their goddess, and in quiet contemplation and the study of magics. 
</p><p>In the Elder Age, the Ogres, Giants and Goblins conquered much of Norrath and began an assault on the Plane of Earth, precipitating retribution from The Rathe in the form of a great curse against all of Rallos Zek’s creations. The fertile homelands of the Giants (now known as Everfrost) were frozen, and those giants caught in the epicenter of the curse were transformed wholly into immortal creatures of living ice. Those nearby were struck to the core of their beings, becoming lesser creatures in mind and body than they had been. Those few who escaped the effects fled Tunaria for other lands, coming to the attention of Prexus the Oceanlord, who sent a great storm to destroy them. The storm drove many ships back to Tunaria and to Kunark, where the curse of The Rathe took hold to a lesser degree than in Everfrost. Many of the most powerful giants managed to escape the storm thanks to their great powers, and passed through the Frigid Barrier to land upon the Icy Fingers in Velious. The Kromrif established themselves in the Eastern Wastes and lived as nomads, eventually coming into conflict with the Coldain. The Kromzek were the most powerful of all Rallos Zek’s creations. Not content with a nomadic lifestyle, they established a mighty fortress city named Kael Drakkal in the Great Scar of Veeshan. The Claws of Veeshan took exception to the intrusion of the Kromzek upon their sacred lands, and thus began the long conflict between the two mightiest races on Norrath, in this most inhospitable of all places. Ages passed, leaving the eastern regions of Velious largely in the control of the Giants. It was during this time that the ships of the Coldain, or Ice Dwarves, were wrecked upon the ice of the Frigid Barrier. Those few who survived to reach the shore escaped the notice of the Claws of Veeshan, but were devastated in a conflict with the fearsome Kromrif. Fleeing the giants, the Coldain established Thurgadin, a hidden underground fortress in the mountains. Since these times, none of the other races of Norrath have dared to approach the Frigid Barrier, and thus Velious remained undiscovered. 
</p><p>In the present day, the Gnomes of Ak’anon have revealed an ocean vessel with the capability of navigating the roughest seas and breaking through ice flows. Upon it’s maiden voyage, the Gnomish Icebreaker successfully penetrated the Frigid Barrier and discovered the islands known as the Icy Fingers. Upon the largest of the islands, the crew discovered an ancient and massive bridge, which arced away into the mists and revealed the tip of a massive glacial continent – Velious!

The scar was made from her feet. There are many shipwrecks at the bottom of the sea near the shore. It is home to the Othmir, a peaceful fishing race of otter-like creatures. The traveler can also find the dragon Kelorek'Dar here, as well as sirens, wyverns, deadly barracudas, sharks, haunted seachests, and walrus type creatures called Bulthar. (EqAtlas) 
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Velious_Zones&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Velious Zones">edit</a>]</div><a name="Crystal_Caverns"></a><h3>Crystal Caverns</h3> are the ancient home of the Coldain, named Froststone, long since overrun by giants and now orcs and other creatures. There are four areas within the tunnels, each controlled by either the Ry'Gorr orcs, the geonids, the crystal spiders (lead by Queen Drachnia), or the Coldain dwarves. The Ry’Gorr orcs control the upper parts of the tunnels, the dwarves the small remnants of their city, the spiders some abandoned halls, and the geonids a set of tunnels they created for themselves.
<p>Crystal Caverns is a mid 30s to late 40s zone which contains the Coldain dwarf mining town of Frostone. There are principally 5 types of mobs in the zone: orcs, which inhabit the mine shaft, the dwarves in Froststone and nearby, the stalags which inhabit the bridge room and the left fork tunnel, the crystalline spiders which inhabit the centre tunnel which leads ultimately to the zone's boss mob lair, that of the spider-queen, Queen Drachnia, and the right hand tunnel which leads to the geonids and the back entrance zone out. It should be noted that this zone out should be considered with caution since it is also the lair of the Coldain Traitor Roderick Tardok, a difficult mob at the levels at which he is usually encountered, extremely magic resistant and prone to cause a lot of damage very quickly.
</p><p>Historian Baenek frequents the caverns, and will tell the traveler about the history of the Coldain dwarves. (EQAtlas)

There are many groups here, the Coldain, the Frost Giants, and the orcs of Ry'Gorr Keep, who have outposts or homes here. One can also find snow dervishes, snow cougars, tundra mammoths, Ulthork, dire wolves, rhinos, and griffins. (EqAtlas) 
<p>The Orc fort contains the entrance to Crystal Caverns, and that zone's exit (out of the geonid tunnel) is nearby. The Orcs often drop Rygorr armor pieces. This fort is also the site of the 8th Coldain Ring War. The zone can be accessed by crossing the bridge from Iceclad Ocean and through a canyon from Great Divide.

It is also the 'entrance zone' to Velious.  The Iceclad Ocean consists of two parts, the open ocean between it and the other continents of Norrath, and Icy Fingers, a series of small fragmented islands that lead to the continent of Velious itself. The Icy Fingers have long been the home of outsiders to Velious, starting with the ancient Tower of Frozen Shadow, up until now where the original gnomes who drove Icebreaker here have turned to pirating. This is also the home of the Snowfang Gnolls, and one arm of the huge Graitspaign dragon bridge lies here, slippery with ice all year round.  The land is home to shadow guardians, snow cougars, snow dervishes, Frost Giants, and Lodizal the turtle. (Eq Atlas)

First and foremost, it is the home of their king, Dain Coldhammer. It has meeting halls and other areas of interest. The second purpose is to serve justice to the Coldain's enemies. Buried beneat the castle is the ancient Pit, a large set of caverns filled with the most horrible creatures imaginable. People that don't please the Dain are sent into the Pit right before his eyes to die a horrible death. Kael Drakkal is home of the Kromzek and Kromrif giants. King Tormax, Derakor the Vindicator, Statue of Rallos Zek, Idol of Rallos Zek and The Avatar of War reside here.
<p>Icewell Keep is the home of Dain, the lord of the Coldain, and is also where justice is dealt, deep within the Pit.  Icewell Keep is deeper in the mountains than the city it is part of, Thurgadin. The new throneroom in Icekeep has recently been converted and now has the entrance to the deadly Pit in the center of it, presumably for quick removal of those who displease the Dain. (Eq Atlas)

Home of Kerafyrm, the offspring from the mating of two dragons of different color, which the Council of Dragons forbade due to the consequences of producing the most powerful chromatic or prismatic dragon -- embodied in Kerafyrm.  Kerafyrm was a dragon of such immense power that he made to magically sleep by the Claws of Veeshan.  He is guarded by four warder dragons, Nanzata, Ventani, Hraashna and Tukaarak, who warn that if he is realeased the world will be in peril. The birth of this dragon caused the first war among dragonkind, which caused the injunction that no dragon could kill another.
<p><i>Kerafyrm's creation and war on the dragons:</i>
</p><p>"Hail, Jortreva the Crusader"
</p><p>Jortreva the Crusader lifts her wings in a graceful motion as she lowers her chin to eye Ironhand in greetings, "I am Jortreva, Crusader of Veeshan. I am the ear to the whispers upon the shadows and the eyes to witness the tainted footsteps of our enemies that corrupt our path. Your kind, the second generation of the lesser gods' creation, have brought us into being as we are now -- for that, we hold neither gratitude nor contempt. It is your actions that have sent us spiraling through an umbra of immeasurable danger that could secure the destruction of all upon this world, but it shall be through the undying efforts of the [champions] that we may have some chance to ward this darkness back into the oblivion it strives to create."
</p><p>"We are four elemental dragons bred to be champions among our people -- within this world. We do not seek recognition or praise from either world -- yours or that of Veeshan's brood -- but we seek to protect and maintain the balance that keeps our worlds separate, yet unified upon the same plane of existence. When Kerafyrm was first placed into stasis by our predecessors, the elemental warders, the [council] ordered the arranged breeding of what would be the warders' replacements when the time came for their stations to ascend. However, the unpredicted actions of the second generation have thrown us into a new role -- the role of Crusaders."
</p><p>"When dragon kind was accompanied upon this world by the lesser god's intrusion, the council of elders was formed. Immediately our ancestors realized the need for our kind to be of sound unification if we were to prevail and remain the superior beings upon what is rightfully our world. As we watched the eras pass through both the second generation and our own cultures, the members of the council changed. Eventually, one known as Kildrukaun would be appointed Arch Priest of Veeshan through divine rite and ceremony -- a sacred part of our institution that I shall not divulge to one as yourself. His first decree would be to condemn the unification of souls between dragons whose elemental influences were of opposition. It was of his belief, and thus the belief of the council, that such a union was against Veeshan's will and would have dire consequences upon the entire dragon nation. Time would pass again before [fate] would descend upon Kildrukaun's decree."
</p><p>"Two dragons of opposite elemental powers confronted the council with their desire to mate. Kildrukaun immediately dismissed any blessing and ordered the dragons from ever fulfilling their desires. These two were young still and very headstrong, regarding the council and its rules to be outdated when considering the growing influence and power of the second generation. They fled to unknown corners of Norrath and there, they bound their souls in a sacred union that would forge the first prismatic dragon. When knowledge of this event came to the council, Kildrukaun, a being of great wisdom and calm heart for regard of his own people looked upon the prismatic's creation as that of Veeshan's will, for conceivably unto him, only Veeshan herself could defy her great priest's rule. The council was in agreement and the hatchling, who would be named Kerafyrm, the Prophetic Savior, was allowed to continue existence under close watch that would be [governed by Kildrukaun himself]." 
</p><p>"Although Kildrukaun was inspired and intrigued by Kerafyrm's existence, he was wary still for he had yet to be witness to the true intent of Veeshan's will. In this time, the dragon nation had split and were in opposing power -- the Ring of Scale whom fled their native Velious for Kunark, and the Claws of Veeshan, the original order and council of dragon kind. It was known that Kildrukaun was furious with the recent division and he strongly believed that it was Veeshan's will for the dragon nations to reunite once again, lest they become as weak and pitiful as the second generation. He viewed Kerafyrm to be the road that would guide the dragons to unification, although it was a unification that would be borne of an unknown purpose that Kerafyrm served. Kildrukaun never interacted with the young prismatic dragon, but served as the dictator behind his mentors. Eventually, Kerafyrm would rise to a power unseen within any dragon of his still fledgling age and Kildrukaun's [prophecy] would be born."
</p><p>"What Prophecy?" 
</p><p>Jortreva the Crusader says "Kildrukaun was of the mind that Kerafyrm was meant to lead the dragon nation in a civil war -- the Claws of Veeshan invading the great mountain fortress known as Veeshan's Peak that the Ring of Scale had established. He was certain that his campaign would unify the dragons and this was nothing less than the will of Veeshan herself. The council dismissed Kildrukaun's prophecy, exclaiming that although they must find a way to bring the Ring of Scale back under the wing of the elder council, they could not wage a war and abandon the threat of Kael Drakkal. Kildrukaun was furious, although he did not confront the council directly. Over the passing centuries, he would sway three of the [council elders] to his side and would personally oversee Kerafyrm's final stages of growth. Eventually the time would come when the council would [recognize their mistake] in allowing Kerafyrm to exist and their order for his termination would be the greatest impact in their destiny."
</p><p>"When dragon kind was accompanied upon this world by the lesser god's intrusion, the council of elders was formed. Immediately our ancestors realized the need for our kind to be of sound unification if we were to prevail and remain the superior beings upon what is rightfully our world. As we watched the eras pass through both the second generation and our own cultures, the members of the council changed. Eventually, one known as Kildrukaun would be appointed Arch Priest of Veeshan through divine rite and ceremony -- a sacred part of our institution that I shall not divulge to one as yourself. His first decree would be to condemn the unification of souls between dragons whose elemental influences were of opposition. It was of his belief, and thus the belief of the council, that such a union was against Veeshan's will and would have dire consequences upon the entire dragon nation. Time would pass again before [fate] would descend upon Kildrukaun's decree."
</p><p>"Kerafyrm quickly ascended the ranks within the Claws of Veeshan and eventually became our most powerful general. He led several successful campaigns against the rising threat of the giants of Kael and his influence grew among the elders of the council. However, something dark grew within him -- his bite became venomous and his talon ruthless in its command over his troops and allies. Eventually, his dominion and influence was nothing short of a monstrous creature of pure malignant hatred and an unrivaled lust for destruction and chaos that the council had no other choice but to demand his destruction -- a rule that Kildrukaun was present to hear and deceitfully condone. Shortly thereafter, Kildrukaun and four council elders whom the arch priest had managed to sway with his charismatic diplomacy and sound argument of his prophecy flew to Kerafyrm's side, where the four of them made preparations for the inevitable [war] to come."
</p><p>Although short lived, the war between Kerafyrm's legions and those of the Claws of Veeshan would be a near crippling blow to the survival of the elder dragon council upon Velious. Kerafyrm's legions were severely outnumbered by those of the elder council, but time and time again they displayed their awesome strength and power. Eventually, Kerafyrm was restrained and taken to what would be his place of indefinite slumber. The four traitorous elders fled Velious safely to unknown locations, where they would lay in wait until the time came that Kerafyrm would be released. After centuries of hiding, the Ancients have returned and they now have a near unbreakable hold upon the former tomb of their master, where again they lay in wait -- anticipating the arrival of their master and the time to execute the undoubtedly phenomenal plan that will [bring about the extinction of all great existence] upon Norrath if they are successful. 
</p><p>Kildrukaun has always despised the second generation and has long sought your total demise. Kerafyrm undoubtedly seeks vengeance for the actions of the Claws of Veeshan against him and together, the arch priest and Kerafyrm will seek to reconstruct this world in their own mind's image of what it should be -- a world that belongs solely to Veeshan's children, reborn in Kildrukaun's ideals, and subservient to Kerafyrm. They are truly mad with hate and an untamable lust for destruction -- one that [we must extinguish] forever." 
</p><p>The Sleeper's Tomb was at the time of the expansion the most difficult zone in the game. After all four guardians of the Sleeper (Kerafyrm), have been killed, the dragon awakes and goes on a rampage killing all in its path. Kerafyrm himself was not intended to be killed but players soon put that idea to rest. After he is killed, the zone's name changes to Kerafyrm's Lair on that server. Entrance to the zone is from Eastern Wastes, and requires a key from a Velious first brood dragon.
</p><p>Note: The two dragons were NOT Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox, although it is unofficially thought that they are his parents.  We know that his father Dozekar the Cursed. He can be found in Hall of Testing, in the Temple of Veeshan. It's his punishment to be slain over and over. However it may be that indeed Lady Vox is the mother, as she shouts at the awakening of Kerafyrm: "The Sleeper stirs! A glorious new age for Norrath is about to begin, and my exile is about to end!"
</p><p>In the original Official EverQuest strategy guide (and the Kunark guide, p. 181), it was hinted that the ice giants were attempting to unite Lady Vox with Lord Nagafen (with the help of some greedy barbarians) but no mention of their past was made.
</p><p>If a group managed to kill all four warders, the magical slumber would break, and Kerafyrm would be set free to continue his reign of terror.
</p><p>As players leveled, and progressed, this eventually became possible. The waking of the Sleeper can only occur once per server. As soon as he is awoken, a script begins, and Kerafyrm lays waste the entire zone.  He then disappears to an unknown place.  The zone is forever changed, as are the items available from that zone.  Morden Rasp was one of, if not THE only server, to have never woke the Sleeper.
</p><p>From <a href="http://www.albrandes.com/skden/articles/sleeper.asp" class='external text' title="http://www.albrandes.com/skden/articles/sleeper.asp" rel="nofollow">The shadowknight Den</a>:
</p><p>On November 15, 2003, 3 guilds of Rallos Zek server awakened the sleeper together. After an epic battle of pure zerging, he was beaten down to 27%, upon where GM's repopped the zone. While they first denied doing so, blaming the incident on a script timer bug, a recent post on eqlive.station.sony.com has the lead GM admitting to the repop as they had assumed that some bug was in effect for our three guilds to have done so well.
</p><p>The next day, 4 warders and the sleeper were respawned by GMs and apologies were posted in addition to exp rewards consisting of some exp (the rez rushing strategy will be explained shortly) and 2 AA handed out to the players in attendance the previous day.
</p><p>On November 17, 2003, those same 3 guilds returned to Sleeper's Tomb with GM consent and monitoring, and offically re-awoke, and killed the sleeper using the same tactic as the previous battle. The battle lasted a total of about 3 hours, involved well over 1000 rezes and had an attendance of nearly 200 people. The corpse lasted 30 seconds as it held no loot.
</p><p>The strategy used (as I have been lead to believe) was to forgo the old "Main Tank" method and simply have a truckload of clerics rezzing everyone who died who would then loot up, and rush in to die again. With such a strategy, many people suffered numerous deaths losing large portions of their level even after all their rezzes.
</p><p>The sleeper hit for maximum of 6999, quadded, and PROC'd a 20k Deathtouch. In addition he had a 20k Targetted death touch, refresh time unknown, no known range limit (he got people numerous times who were sitting down somewhere). He resisted all spell attempts except Manaburn, and Harmtouch. The fight was pure Range/Melee/Pets, and the Manaburn/Harmtouches when they recycled.

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Velious_Zones&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Velious Zones">edit</a>]</div><a name="Siren.27s_Grotto"></a><h3>Siren's Grotto</h3> An icy cave/grotto populated by sea beings, partially underneath the water, located between Cobalt Scar and the Western Wastes.  Find neriad maidens, seahorses, walrus, and enthralled helpers here. Siren's Grotto links Cobalt Scar and the Western Wastes. You have to travel through here to reach The Temple of Veeshan, which is found in the middle of Western Wastes.
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Velious_Zones&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Velious Zones">edit</a>]</div><a name="Skyshrine"></a><h3>Skyshrine</h3> is a huge dungeon which also houses one of the most powerful Velious first brood dragons, Lord Yelinak. This zone is not dangerous for those who are on the Claws of Veeshan faction of dragons. It is also the place for handing in Kael armor pieces for forging into real armor, dropped by various giants in Kael Drakkal. 
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Velious_Zones&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Velious Zones">edit</a>]</div><a name="The_Temple_of_Veeshan"></a><h3>The Temple of Veeshan</h3> is the home of the Claws of Veeshan faction of dragons. The vast majority of end-game velious items are here, with a drastically different "risk vs reward" for any other velious (or previous) zone. Most of the Velious lore is attached with various dragons living in this zone. 
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Velious_Zones&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15" title="Velious Zones">edit</a>]</div><a name="Thurgadin"></a><h3>Thurgadin</h3> is the home of the Coldain dwarves, who have live on the icy continent of Velious. The Coldain had to flee their old home after it was conquered by the frost giants. They now live in isolation in the Great Divide.
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Velious_Zones&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16" title="Velious Zones">edit</a>]</div><a name="Tower_of_Frozen_Shadow"></a><h3>Tower of Frozen Shadow</h3> is a midlevel dungeon consisting of roughly 7 different floors of creatures, each with a unique story and design. The tower appears to be something of a school for the undead. There are at least seven levels, all of which require a key to move higher, that have undead on every floor.
<p>The tower's history is shrouded in mystery, but it appears that the once-living members of the tower were brought here to remain safe during the Erudite/Heretic war, but something unknown came to pass and left them cursed to remain here forever.
</p><p>Tserrina Syl'Tor is rumored to have lived in this castle.  There are slashed pictures of Mayong Mistmoore, the vampire, hanging on the walls, but the reason for their destruction is unknown.  Students and teachers inhabit the ground floors.  In the upper reaches of the castle, you can attend an undead wedding.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Velious_Zones&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17" title="Velious Zones">edit</a>]</div><a name="Velketor.27s_Labyrinth"></a><h3>Velketor's Labyrinth</h3> is a 50's level hunting dungeon, notorious for its many crooked icy catwalks that can be easily fell from. Home and profane laboratory of Velketor the Scorcerer, a powerful magician. It was designed with an eye towards security, and is very difficult to penetrate deeply inside.
<p>To move deeper into Velketor's lair you must move vertically over narrow ledges climbing upwards. These ledges and overpasses are covered in tretcherous ice, so you must move carefully or risk falling off. The ledges and overpasses are filled with pit traps, tumbling tresspassers to their deaths below. Spiders here can turn invisible to attack, and many monsters can also see invisible as well. 
The labrynth consists of two separate areas, the first being the maze (described above), and the keep area, which is where Velketor lives. The keep itself is surrounded by hordes of roaming monsters.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Velious_Zones&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18" title="Velious Zones">edit</a>]</div><a name="Wakening_Land"></a><h3>Wakening Land</h3> is an outdoor zone where Wuoshi the Dragon is found as well as the Plane of Growth. It is a large forested valley on this otherwise frozen continent. The goddess Tunare has a very palpable presence here, and is likely the reason that the area is so full of life.
<p>This zone also is the site of an ongoing battle between the Kromrif and Kromzek and the members of the Court of Tunare.
The zone is split up into several general areas, each with their own dangers. The first area most people reach is the area near Kael Drakkal. This area is frequented by the frost and storm giants, and is dangerous to most unless they've made friends with them.
</p><p>Moving south to the next area, which is another area of interest to many people, is where the Dragon Portal is located. The great dragon Wuoshi makes his home right at the portal. He is on the same faction as Skyshrine, so unless you've made friends there, he will attack you and, unless you're in a very large group or very lucky, most likely kill you.
</p><p>Farther west lies the geonid tunnels. The geonids are generally friendly, but the tar goos which can be found occasionally there are not, and if they attack you, so will the geonids. Further west lies the entrance to Skyshrine. There is nothing inherently dangerous about this, except that the tigeraptors and tigesaurs live here, and are inherently aggressive to everyone who travels through. 
Moving back east, most of the top half of the zone is filled with creatures devoted to Tunare. This means that if Tunare doesn't like you (you know who you are) this is probably not the place for you to be. If Tunare doesn't mind you, however, this place is safe. (EQAtlas)

It is the last remaining home of a large number of dragons on Norrath. They are frequently found roaming the wastes.  Many of the dragons are allied with The Claws of Veeshan.
