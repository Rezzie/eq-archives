In your second point you talk about the feeble guard not being able to kill Young Kodiaks&#8230; And yet, you find opponents of Young Kodiak danger level out in East or West Commons&#8230; <br><br>Yes, the gate guards are the 'newbie' guards for Nektulos. <br><br>And there are other guards that are hunted, take a look out in the Karanas. Head over to Steamfont&#8230; <br><br>I guess my question to you is, why does in matter that those guards are killed? Humans in Freeport have the same level of guard protection in the area that they fight in at that level. I guess I'm confused by your anger at this situation&#8230; <br><br>By the way, I agree about the Lavastorm thing.

Perhaps a bit over my head, intellectually&#8230; <br><br>I think it's wrong to imply that you can only do one or the other, either increase the power of the monsters OR decrease the power of player characters, if your goal is to make the game harder (and that's IF&#8230;). <br><br>The real world answer is that you do both as the situation requires. In the case of one bit of the picture being off, say an item or a spell that makes one class or character type or tactic too powerful, relatively, you obviously reduce the power of that item. If you want to make the world as a whole more difficult for the heroes in it, then you can do either, really. Obviously the preferable method is to increase the AI for the monsters, or find other clever ways to make them more powerful. <br><br>That being said, don't go overboard. If we do something that reduces the power of an item or spell or somesuch, it's done in consideration of the whole. I like to picture class balance as a sort of sea (ok, I've never pictured it that way until just now&#8230;). Waves are expected, even desirable. But when you see a tsunami, what do you do? Do you raise the ocean or lower the wave? Keep in mind that if you raise the ocean you'll drown the world&#8230; <br><br>I love bad analogies. :)</UL>

Gordon stopped by the Gameplay Board today to make a couple of posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035008.html"><b>Downtime Affecting Users Across World</b></a><br>After having addressed many times I wonder if I should keep trying or give up, but I'll give it another short: <br><br>EverQuest is played all over the world. ANY time that we take the servers down will be SOMEONE's primetime. We try to take them down when the fewest number of people will be affected, that will mean taking them down during off-peak time for the America's. <br><br>It's a matter of math. How can we affect the fewest number of people possible? If *peak* was at 4am my time and the low point were at 8pm, we'd take them down at 8pm even though it was primetime here. <br><br>I realize as an off-peak player you don't like this, any more than Americans who play during off-peak like it, but until peak time moves to a time other than the time it is, our scheduled patches will be in the general viscinity of when this one is taking place. I'm sorry, but there is really no other option that makes sense. I've seen people argue that we should stagger patch times so that it falls in someone elses peak every time, but that does not meet the goal of affecting the fewest number of people possible. <br><br>Now, that said, no spawn is "exactly 7 days", nor is it exactly "three days". Any spawn over two hours has a +/- modifier that adjusts its spawn time. That means that the seven day spawn could very well pop up anywhere from six to eight days after it was killed.<br>--<br>It's plus or minus a percentage of the total spawn delay. That means that a two-hour spawn would have a variation of minutes, whereas a 7 day spawn could very well have a variation of days days.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035118.html"><b>Enchanter Pets</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What we want to know now is this. Will enchanter pets be made to dual-wield automatically at the levels you mentioned, just as mage and necro, and shadowknight pets now do? ]</i></font><br><br>In a word: No. <br><br>The enchanter pets consist of a floating sword and shield.

A new message now appears on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>November 29th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems reported by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other gameplay issues:<br><br>- Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum.  Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction.<br><br>- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a player character rather than an NPC.  The change last patch reduced them to a rate below player characters.  As part of this patch, target-specific random effects will only work if the target is the intended type.  For instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" will only "go off" on a summoned NPC instead of everything.  <br><br>- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or two every few minutes.  For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, this should address the issue.<br><br>- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards.  Included in these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it.  <br><br>- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting to get back in.<br><br>- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping is enabled.  Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to release resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable until the next version of DirectX is adopted.<br><br>- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the "NOKEY" setting instead of the "Backspace".  This means that you can now assign "Backspace" to a function in game.<br><br>- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played "rapid-fire" under some circumstances.  There is still a potential for this to happen with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the near future.<br><br>- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult than intended after the server had been up for a while.<br><br>- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability to dual-wield without being handed weapons.  The calculation used to determine whether or not this ability exists takes several things into account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons (higher for the Shadowknight) will have this ability.  It is possible that you could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th level pet that will not have this ability. <br><br>- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant.  Abandon your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune.<br><br>- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill.<br><br>Remember! Only a few days left until the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious.  Reserve your copy at your local retailer today!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

A detailed report of a recent event on the Bertoxxulous server was sent to me today by Iuveniel:<BLOCKQUOTE>Today as we went about our business in the fair city<br>of Firiona Vie, a shout was heard throughout the area<br>proclaiming that the defenders of the city come forth<br>and speak with a man by the name of Danak Dhorentath. <br>Upon arriving at the stone bridge we glimpsed an Iksar<br>figure in the distance, away from the guards.  Curious<br>we went forth to his side and asked what business he<br>had demanding that we come to his call.  Unworried<br>about being surrounded by the Defenders of Firiona<br>Vie, he explained that he had cast a ritual that would<br>shield him from harm and that we would do best to<br>entertain his speech.<br><br>This Iksar, Danak Dhorentath, apparently is<br>responsible for the kidnapping of Firiona Vie and has<br>held her these past six months torturing her for the<br>information only she herself can give up.  Danak<br>talked of the staff that she carried, a blessed weapon<br>of Tunare, and how his necromancer friend Vahlai had<br>discovered a ritual to steal away the Elven Princess'<br>powers.  These powers would be given instead to<br>Vahlai, Danak, and the evil Iksar Venril Sathir.  He<br>spoke of power over all of Norrath and how one person<br>in attendance had the power to stop this ritual,<br>though he never alluded to who it may be except in<br>vague hints and cryptic words.<br><br>This person would be presented a chance at some point<br>to stop the ritual or else claim the power with Danak<br>and rule over Norrath.  The evil being also spoke of<br>Galeth and the Companions returning to the lands of<br>Kunark.  Only time shall tell what the future holds<br>for our world and if Firiona Vie shall be released!<br><br>/ooc This event was wonderfully played out.  The group<br>of people gathered was only 10-15 strong at first, but<br>then began to grow as word spread, although it never<br>exceeded 25.  The GM did a wonderful job of keeping<br>the story VERY interesting and entertaining and I for<br>one am happy that I was able to participate.  One<br>person did attempt to strike down Danak but quickly<br>met his demise.  VERY quickly!  I applaud everyone at<br>the event for doing such a wonderful job roleplaying<br>it out and hope to see you all on the next segment of<br>the tale!<br><br>Attached are some screenshots of the event.<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/danak4.jpg">Screenshot #4</a><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid975469781,16381,"><b>Event Log</b></a></UL><br>Iuveniel Woodspirit<br>54th Unkempt Druidess<br>Bertoxxulous Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

It's always been based on the level of the NPC and the zone you are in. <br><br>- No change was made to make people lose more experience on death. The only change to this that has occurred since release was when it was halved. <br><br>- No change was made to reduce the amount of loot entering the world on a global scale. <br><br>Now in regards to your suggestions regarding level based equipment, it was decided some time ago that EQ would not take that route. The FAQ has a pretty good explanation regarding this suggestion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BTW this was not a bash or flame, I am just concerend, I've been playing EQ for erm what 3 years now, and this latest move SCARES me.]</i></font> <br><br>Well two and a half years at most if you were in the earliest beta phase, but I don't believe that the "latest move" that you spoke of above occurred.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034913.html"><b>Necro & Magician Damge Rates Against Green Frog</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What is wrong with this picture:<br>he never ran out of mana...<br>he resisted unresistable spells...<br>he never got hurt even with 2 50+ pets wailing on him due to lifetap...]</i></font> <br><br>Nothing really. He's not an NPC that we want to be killed. As for the "unresistable" spells, there are only a couple of truly unresistable spells in game, and they all belong to NPCs.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034727.html"><b>Patch Problems</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Still can't activate spells with the control key, like you could before the patch (<ctrl> + <number 1-8> )]</i></font> <br><br>The default key was changed to ALT. You can check it back to CTRL if you like by going into Options/Keyboard. <br><br><br>2. I've never heard of that one. It sounds like a problem with your video card or driver, perhaps the way it's handling mipmapping. Have you tried turning off mipmapping to see what happens? <br><br>3. The spell line eats mana gradually. When you ran out of mana it didn't wear off. It was a bug fix. Should it have been reported? Certainly, but it's still a bug fix.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034702.html"><b>Witch Hunts</b></a><br>I'm unaware of any case where someone found a ban to be "probably mistaken" yet did not reverse it.

"Oh yeah, one more thing. Why doesnt EQ put the maps of the citys in there guide when you buy the game??"]</i></font> <br><br>There are indeed maps of the playable cities in the manual released with the Kunark full-retail box, which I believe is the only thing on the shelves these days. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. "Its been 2 years and they still havn't made the game compatible with most sound cards (promissed June, '98 that there would be a new sound engine VERY Shortly, September '00 still no engine)" ]</i></font><br><br>First, the game never had a problem with "most" sound cards as suggested. Some people running under certain configurations (with the SBLive for instance) had problems, where as others had no problems of that nature though they used the same card. The vast majority of people (including myself on my home system which included an SBLive) never had any problems. <br><br>As to the new sound engine, it's in. It went in the same time as the DX7 update. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. On the new expansion coming out "Still havnt fixed some bugs from beta.. "]</i></font> <br><br>It wouldn't be proper to comment without a specific list of "bugs from beta" to know what you are getting at. Most issues that exist and have existed for that period of time are not bugs, but rather a waived design issues that will never be addressed due to various technology limitations (download size being chief among them). They are part of the game now, and we'll have to live with them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. "I love EQ so don't get me wrong. I play AC also and, I have to admit, am wondering why AC makes upgrades and increases land/monsters/spells/items/etc etc, for FREE and EQ makes you pay for them? Just wondering..." ]</i></font><br><br>They have their business plan and we have ours. We've added tons of new content (quests, items, spells, even zones) for "free" as well. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034717.html"><b>The Point of AFK</b></a><br>Sinneed's response was pretty concise. <br><br>Basically, there's no "pause" button in a persistant world, at least not ours. The only way we would implement a "safe AFK" would be if there was absolutely no in-game benefit to using it. That means that we'd have to make you blind and deaf as well as stopping any type of regeneration and skill-use countdowns. <br><br>At that rate, the question indeed becomes, why not just log off?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034469.html"><b>Magical Damage</b></a><br>This keeps coming up as an example, though I've addressed it before. <br><br>What does "magical damage" mean to you? To you does that mean that any spell that does damage available to a wizard of a certain level should do more damage than any other spell available to any other class of a particular level? <br><br>If so, that's not the definition we use. Our definition is damage over a time period. A DOT that does more damage overall than ICE comet does not do it in the short period of time like Ice Comet. Of those two spells you mentioned, one wizard and one mage, the wizard spell is faster and more mana efficient. <br><br>Wizard spells across the board have usually have either better casting times, better mana ratios, do more damage, or a combination of the three than those of any other class (harmtouch excluded) ***over a period of time***. That's how it works, and wizards fit that definition. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034695.html"><b>More Druid Forms Needed?</b></a><br>"Require" is a pretty strong word. While I understand that you *want* more forms, I don't think that they are required. As such, it's certainly good content for the wish-list, but it's not something that I can say we will or will not do at some point in the future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034622.html"><b>NPC Named "!"</b></a><br>The exclaimation point is indicative of an NPC that has been "permakilled", which usually happens when a problem is found after the live servers come up that is severe enough to justify removing the NPC from the game until they can be patched. <br><br>There are a few other problems which can cause them to pop up unintentionally, requiring a patch to fix them. Often, if it is a critical NPC, we'll patch the zone without taking the servers down to clear up the problem.</UL>

Here's a couple of posts recently made by Alan on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888.html"><b>Shaman Issues</b></a><br>Rorgg said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Admit the spell had its intended functionality before. Your statement made it sound like the way the Rage series has been operating was due to a bug. That's not true and I think everyone knows it. The Rage series spells were designed with the full knowledge that draining empty mana would not cancel them, that was part of the design.]</i></font> <br><br>It was working that way due to a bug. But it was also working pretty much as intended. The two are not exclusive ideas. The bug is fixed. Now we need to fix the "as intended part". <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Admit the mechanics changed for a new spell line and VI did not anticipate the effects of changing the mechanic (which is obvious from Torpor). Promise us better QC in these regards.]</i></font> <br><br>I have admitted that it was changed to make it so that spells that use mana continuously couldn't use mana that didn't exist (I will neither confirm nor deny anything about any new spell lines). We're not hiding it. And we did not anticipate this particular effect to occur with the change in the mechanic. I won't promise better quality control in the future. I will promise that we will work on having better quality control in the future (a subtle difference. The trick here is that if our quality control improves, most people would never notice. You can't see all the problems that we catch, only the ones we don&#8217;t). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Do NOT leave us with a gimped replacement or no fix. ]</i></font><br><br>I have no intention of that. I'd like to see the spell working mostly as it was. But this is also a chance for the community to voice its opinions on this particular spell, at a time when we know we have to change it. Let's keep this thread to that purpose. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Above all, do NOT flee the thread. The more you talk to us, the calmer we are. The thing we're most afraid of is being left with no replacement, like the other two times this has happened. ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not going anywhere. It's my job to stay here and talk. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. Go /bonk the live team. They deserve it. ]</i></font><br><br>Not really. There are a LOT of spells and spell effects in EverQuest. Missing one on a change like that (of the many changes that are made) isn't too bad. Besides, some of these guys are a lot stronger and tougher than I am&#8230; <br><br>Please, let's keep this thread to the topic at hand. Yelling at me about pets or other issues dilutes the ideas that we are looking for here. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034748.html"><b>Mage Bug with Pets</b></a><br>Thanks for the info.

Brian Hook, one of the most recognizable people in the gaming industry, resigned from his post at Verant Interactive yesterday.  The guys at Voodoo Extreme caught up with Brian today to <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/games/interviews/hook/">get the full story behind his depature</a>.  Here's a snippet:<UL><b>VoodooExtreme: Why did you leave Verant?</b><br><br>Brian Hook: First, let me state up front that this was a completely amicable departure.  Verant was very good to me.  Smed [John Smedley, Verant/SOE Executive VP] and I have a good rapport, and he&#8217;s a genuinely good guy that I like a lot.<br><br>But to answer your question, I was just getting uncomfortable with the very corporate environment there.  You have to understand my background  I left 3Dfx when it had less than 50 employees; when I worked for Silicon Graphics I was just a contractor, so I never had to deal with &#8220;big company&#8221; issues; and at id there were about a dozen employees.  So I come from a very small company mentality.  When I went to Verant it felt absolutely huge  I think there were about 70 or so employees, but I don&#8217;t quite remember  but after the acquisition by Sony it got even huger.  All of a sudden I was working for this gigantic company based out of Japan instead of a relatively small game developer, and that just wasn&#8217;t as enjoyable for me.  This isn&#8217;t a slam on Sony, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m a lot more comfortable working with a small group of people without a lot of corporate &#8220;stuff&#8221; to deal with. </UL>Thanks Steph!

A lengthy post was made in response by Gordon to a thread entitled "<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034311.html">Verant vs. Players</a>" found on the Gameplay Board.<UL>This is the retail version of EQ, the classes and races should have been balanced before you released it. <br><br><b><I>That's easy to say, and for the most part it was true. However we *have* been adding content to the game with every patch, including tons of new zones that over doubled the worlds size since release. Every time we add something, we run the risk of creating an imbalance that needs to be addressed, or else we have a broken game that people will not play. Make no mistake: People will not play a broken game. <br><br></b></i>All the patches should only be adding content and bug fixes, not plugging up ingenious strategies which the players found and which you didn't think of. <br><br><b><I>It goes without saying that 300K people can discover strategies that weren't found by the 40K or so that were in all phases of the beta, and the 2000 people that were in for all but the last month of beta. Additionally, many of these "ingenious strategies" that you speak of were created by us attempting to add more content by way of items, quests, abilites, etc., to the game. <br><br></b></i>We players are not here to find crack's in the design of EQ for you. <br><br><b><I>No, you are here to have fun. However that aside, you will still find cracks in the design of EQ for us throughout that process. I'm thankful we have a dev team working to address those cracks as they are discovered, or again we'd have a broken game. <br><br></b></i>If you truely don't like how we players play this game, or the strategies we come up with, then keep them in mind for when your designing EQ2, but dont punish us here and now. <br><br><b><I>Again you seem to be saying that it would be better to leave gross imbalances in game that cause people to leave rather than correct them. I have to respectfully disagree, and say with some authority that this will not be the case with any game we make. These games are designed to last in the marketplace for a number of years, and need to last that long to cover development costs, both past and present. If they do not draw enough subscribers or last long enough, the game fails and future development is hurt by it. We won't sit around and watch a game fail when we can do something about it. Now EQ was never in jeopardy of that because we've always addressed these problems as they came up, but if we left every problem, or tried to address them all in a "positive" manner by increasing the power of "A" through "Y" because Z is overpowered, it would not be long before everything in game was elavated to broken proportions. <br><br></b></i>Maybe you should realize that this game you created has taken on a life of its own when boxed it and sold it. <br><br><b><I>Actually it took on a life of its own over a year before release when the community was formed by people interested in the game. As with anything alive though, things are in a constant state of flux. Things change, and we have to change with them to be sure that everything stays in line. <br><br></b></i>thats exactly my point. Don't do anything. So what if warriors found a way to solo blues up to 60. So what if every other warrior is doing it 3 weeks later. How does it hurt anyone? <br><br><b><I>So what if all classes found a way to do it? Should we leave it then? Suddenly you have everyone in the game running around without a need to group. Classes become meaningless as one class can do pretty much anything that the next class can. Class A is no longer dependant on class B for good or services in order to advance. That alone would reduce the social impact of the game by making it unnecessary for people to meet each other. Suddenly we'd have 300K people playing a single person game on our servers, with nothing really to hold them together. Aside from the hardcore players, the game would be dead within 6 months. </b></i><br><br>Always ADD never TAKE away because when you take away (nerf) you punish. <br><br><b><I>And *never* make a policy absolute, with exception to the policy of *never* making a policy absolute. Once you completely block out a particular course of action you limit yourself for no good reason other than it being "policy". <br><br>As mentioned above, the policy of buffing up A-Y every time Z is overpowered is not at all suited to this environment. We would be constantly increasing every classes abilities, or the power of their spells or items, because of "inequities" cited by one class or another. <br><br>Can we agree that as long as we have a class-based system, where classes have complimentary strengths and weaknesses, that there will always be people who believe that the strengths are not strong enough and that the weaknesses are too severe? </b></i><br><br>If Verant really does really not like this new strategy, then they should tip their hat to the player who discovered it, and remember to make that strategy impossible in some future EQ game. <br><br><b><I>That's certainly the policy advocated by the ever-quoted "mudwimping" article, an article that I personally disagree with. As I mentioned above, absolutes are dangerous. Completely ruling out one reasonable course of action and exclusively increasing power or abilities of the game as a whole is a BAD thing to do. It's as bad as exclusively decreasing power or abilities. Neither is an appropriate course of action. That article gets a lot of mention because it suggests a course of action that is popular with socieity: more, more, more, never less. <br><br>There's a quote that suits this situation quite well, so I'll paraphrase: What is right is not always popular, and what is popular is not always right. It basically speaks to the fact that people do not always make the choices that are best for them. I'm sure that we could adopt the suggestions in the mudwimping article and please a lot of people in the short run, but as soon as something came up that completely unbalanced the game, invalidating a class or two, and we decided to leave things as is or enter the "enhancement death spiral", there would be no peace. <br><br>Let me string a series of analogies together. I'm sure they all have their flaws, but I think that the point is sound. Imagine if: <br><br>- banks have a policy of *always* taking the customers word for it in a disputed account.<br>- paying taxes was voluntary (some argue that it is, but still)<br>- we released all of the "innocent" people from jail.<br>- *everyone* has a college degree<br>- *everyone* has at least a million dollars <br><br>These are situations that are pleasing and popular to those who are to be affected, but what happens when they are applied to everyone across the boards? Would any of this be right? Yes, if *I* have a problem at the bank I'd like to know that they'd just take *my* word for it. Yes, *I'd* like paying taxes to be voluntary for *me*. Yes, if *I* was in jail, I know *I'd* be innocent of any crime that would put *me* there so *I'd* like to be released. Yes, *I'd* like to have a college degree. Yes, *I* would like a million bucks. <br><br>But everyone?! NO. *I* can vouch for what is good for *me*, but I know that it's not good for global policy. No, I wouldn't like the idea of banks taking everyone's word for it, as I know that fraud would increase to the point of critical failure and that the entire economy would collapse. No, I wouldn't want paying taxes to be voluntary, because then very few would, government programs would fail, we'd have no standing army, and the government would collapse. No, I wouldn't like everyone who say's that they are innocent to be released from jail. That's why we have a court system. No, I wouldn't want *everyone* to have a college degree, because then a college degree would be meaningless. No, I wouldn't want everyone to have a million bucks, because inflation would run out of control, milk and bread would cost thousands of dollars per unit, and the money would all be in the hands of the top 1% within a month anyway, putting them that much further out of *my* reach. <br><br>One final analogy that fits better than the rest. Imagine if: <br><br>- we increased the power of a class/item/ability, etc., every time "enough" (whatever that means) people complained.</b></i> <br><br>So to answer your question, Verant should only add content, or leave things as they are. <br>Koen <br><br><b><I>Well, while I appreciate your ability to state your opinion in a manner that is appropriate for this forum, I must respectfully disagree with the points that you've made.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

It asks you to visit a page linked to via html in the email, the email will even read that it's from a Sony email account.  Don't be fooled though, following the links will take you to the freebie hosting site known as AngelFire and ask you to input your password <i>and</i> credit card information in web form.  <br><br>I will post an exact copy of the email to let you know what to watch out for.

Alan made a few posts today on the official Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/032418-4.html"><b>Big Thread on Mage Problems</b></a><br>Well, I don't think I'll be able to answer most of these to your satisfaction, but I'm willing to try. I'll tell you now that a post this long is going to be hard to answer, and I don't have all the answers to anyone's problems. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Since the last patch, it has been speculated that the proc rate on sword of runes has decreased.]</i></font> <br><br>I think, by now, you all know the answer to this one. The proc rate on all pet weapons has been reduced to be the same as any player character with the same dexterity. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>It has been speculated that CotH has been altered such that it's chance of clearing aggro has been greatly reduced. It has also been altered so that CoHing a pet caster does not cause his pet to suicide.]</i></font><br><br>Here's what I know. Call of the Hero will probably never always clear the hate list. And we haven't changed anything (that we know of) that reduced the chance that it would clear the hate list. But we have a possible fix ready to be patched that might increase the chance of the hate list being cleared. The same goes for the pet suicide thing, we should have a fix for that in the next patch. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  VELIOUS SPELLS]</i></font><br><br>I'm not discussing Scars of Velious spells. But I'm not going to discourage you from talking about them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Linkdeath. Mages suffer from this more than any other class, since our startup summoning routines (depending upon the situation) can consume anywhere from 2 bubbles to our full mana bar.]</i></font> <br><br>Always been that way, since day one. This is one of the drawback of magehood. We just can't program around accidental link death, we can't tell it from purposeful linkdeath. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Post-50 pet upgrades.]</i></font><br><br>Well, this one baffles me a bit. I, frankly, don't know enough about high level pets. All I can tell you is that I'll look at it and ask questions. But, by way of warning, understand that nobody was promised that they would become super powerful post-50&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Post-50 fire pet.]</i></font><br><br>Again, I dunno. I'll look at it, with the same caveat as the last one. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>Deafening Decoy. This pet is not a decoy. Its taunt is ineffective.]</i></font> <br><br>This one is new to me. You should explain this in depth, especially if you want this to be the defining thread on the mage class. I understood the previous two because I had read them elsewhere, but this one is out of left-field for me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  they begin to hit the pet's controller THROUGH the mob, regardless of distance. These hits seem to be based on the controller's AC (all I know is that I am always hit for full). Please fix this bug, Verant, so that I can get rid of my eboots =) Maybe then we can look at the Decoy.]</i></font><br><br>I thought this bug was fixed. It's been a while since I've seen it. I'll ask about it. If you can tell me how to reproduce this bug, we'll gladly find it and squash it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Post-50 spells in general. Mage summons are largely junk. Our spell lines see only minor upgrades in RoK, certainly not in keeping with mob increases.]</i></font><br><br>Well, one man's junk&#8230; <br><br>But if I were to run out and stealth add some interesting but not powerful summons for you, would that be enough? Summons have never really been intended to add to the power of the class, only to its utility (with some notable exceptions). New summons would fall along the same lines. Again, I can't talk about Scars of Velious spells. But I will keep this request in mind if/when we start to look at new spells for magicians. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Mages have no defensive spells: no root, snare, sow, harmshield, shadowstep, crowd control, etc. We are, in effect, the most limited casting class in the game. ]</i></font><br><br>My Take:<br>So what? I am fine in my role, and so long as I am not crippled in my offensive capabilities, I could care less about defense. It's called a drawback, and all classes should have them. What causes people to clamor for these abilities is that our offensive capabilities suffer post-50. Fix our pets and summons in the late game and these complaints will fade away.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok. Because it's highly unlikely that magicians will get things like snare, root or sow. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Mages have minimal group utility. <br><br>My Take:<br>A Mage's major contribution to a group is his pure offensive power. That power has decreased relative to other classes post-50, certainly; however, Mages remain powerful, and I think that the majority of problems that Mages face in groups are because other players do not recognize this. There are legitimate problems: zones where pets are unwanted, for instance, and against Uber Mobs, where Mages are wholly ineffectual. I personally would like to see some group-specific capabilities given to Mages, in return for our soloing ability being crippled post-50. However, this is not a huge priority, and could easily be fixed by addressing the issues with our late game pets and summons. CotH was a good start. (Thanks, Verant.)]</i></font><br><br>You're now getting into seriously overlapping your requests. This, again, seems like a request to up the power of your post 50 pets and your summons and these complaints will fade away. Let's not dilute the discussion by adding things that you don't really need. And you are telling me here that magicians are very powerful pre-50 and acceptably powerful post 50, but that other players just don't know this. Part of the problem with your initial post was: IT'S TOO DARN LONG (and, therefore so is my response). You've included a lot of info, and that's great. But you're asking me to read and comprehend four pages (when pasted into Word) of magician specific stuff, some of which are repeated requests for the same thing&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Mage-specific loot in RoK is sparse, and what does exist is fairly subpar, compared to both existing Mage gear and what other classes get.]</i></font> <br><br>Again, I dunno. I'll take your word for it. I also can't tell you what is or is not in Velious. How about we hold off until we see if this is addressed in Velious? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>The Mage epic quest requires clearing the 7th island of sky. <br><br>My Take:<br>I disagree that this is a problem. These quests were intended to be completed by guilds, not individuals. The difficulty of epic quests is not determined by the difficulty of the mobs involved. That is, in fact, irrelevant (provided that they are killable). It is determined by access to the mobs and the frequency of the drops.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, so we can take this one off the list, since I agree with you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Problem:<br>We require a rare drop off a roaming mid-level rare spawn in a fairly low-level zone. Getting this item can take weeks or months.]</i></font> <br><br>If this is the Pegasus Cloak, there are other ways to get it&#8230; it's not no-drop, is it? So buy the thing. It's been dropping since about the time the game opened, there are plenty of them on the servers&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>We require a rare drop off a seven day spawn that is highly contested. Based on the number of these items on various servers, it seems that it is a 1/30 drop.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, again, I have to guess that you are talking about the staff. And again, this item has been dropping for a while. They can be gained. I'm not saying this is easy. But the reward is worth it. And there is a bit of exaggeration in your time estimations&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Problem:<br>Before the recent patch, the Elemental Binder was not dropping. Now it is. Burning Embers and Dirt of Underfoot have still not been found.]</i></font><br><br>The drop rate on the Binder was indeed increased, at the request of the players. IT WAS NOT BROKEN. It just was a rare drop. It isn't so rare now. The Dirt has been found, we did nothing to its drop rate. The Embers will be found. Once again; tough to get, worth the effort. <br><br>In any case, I wanted you to be aware that I do read these things. I just don't like to post incomplete answers like these. <br><br>I think I'll go back to my vacation&#8230; I still need to see Unbreakable. I'll be back to read this thread again on Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034032.html"><b>More Pet Issues</b></a><br>No, we don't plan to remove weapon use from pet. <br><br>Please, next time ask this kind of question in an already existing thread.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033968.html"><b>On Rogue Skills</b></a><br>You're not going to like this, but... <br><br>It's working as intended. <br><br>This was done intentionally, there was no programming error here.</UL>

Abashi stopped by the Gameplay Board today to make <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034160.html">the following announcement</a>:<UL><I>Some people have been reporting that their screen freezes every so often while in game, causing all sorts of mischief. While we are looking into that problem, and do have some changes planned for the next patch that should reduce its occurance, there are some things that you can do first to see if it improves:<br><br>1. Virus scan software: These problems usually run in a systray (down by the clock). By default, they typically are set to scan files every time they are accessed. This could be causing some of those problems, as EverQuest accesses several local files at every character save. Try disabling it to see if your situation improves.<br><br>2. IRQs. PCI devices are designed so that they can share IRQs. That works well in principle, but can cause problems when several high bus-bandwidth devices are on the same IRQ. Typically we've seen this when sound and video cards are on the same IRQ. You can try disabling your sound by placing a file called "NOSOUND.TXT" (file contents do not matter) in your EverQuest directory. If your freezing goes away, there is a good chance it's a shared IRQ problem. The method by which to reassign IRQs varies from system to system, but can be done by either moving the sound card to a different slot, manually assigning IRQs in the BIOS, or manually assigning them in the Device Manager. You probably shouldn't attempt any of these without the assistance of your local computer guru, unless of course you are the local guru.<br><br>As mentioned above, we are putting in some changes in next week's patch that should help the situation for those that aren't affected by #1 or #2, but you'll want to make sure that the problems above are not the cause of your problems before counting on the patch to fix it.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>
