The race is over and here are the results and report from Avalan:<BLOCKQUOTE>All was calm in Lesser Faydark Saturday when a cry shattered the peaceful afternoon, "The Gnomes are coming, The Gnomes are coming!" as nearly 30 gnomes burst forth from the Steamfont zone, feet beating the ground as fast as their little legs could push them. Battles stalled, women screamed and Beasts of all kinds licked their chops as the small horde of Gnaked Gnome Racers streamed by. And so it went from zone to zone, continent to continent as the dwindling number of gnomes strove to reach the gates of Halas and prove that such a quest could be done. One by one and in groups the brave gnomes fell to beasts, raiders and orc, in the Commons, the Karanas and Everfrost as they struggled to reach their goal. <P>Just as race officials were beginning to think that none would survive the ordeal, shouts of "Run Gnome Run!" could be heard echoing through the mountains of Everfrost. Of the 28 racers that started the race, only 7 made it to the Everfrost zone. Exactly 55 minutes after the start of the Antonica leg of the race, the first weary gnome staggered up the ramp to the Halas zone and finished. 22 minutes later the last of the 5 finishers tagged the race official.<P>/ooc This event, sponsored by the Starrwarriors Guild of Tarew Marr had 3 parts. A Sprint from AK'Anon to the end of the docks in Butcher, The main race from ship docking in Freeport to the Halas ramp in Everfrost, and a Last Man Standing Brawl at the end of the race. Winners could select from cash awards and special items for their prizes<P>Winners of the Sprint: <br>1st - GGNocologee (Srik)<br>2nd - GGRumfelt (Wump)<br>3rd - GGRacer (Zenar)<P>Winners of the Race: <br>1st - GGRoper<br>2nd - GGRabkinkin<br>3rd - GGRawinkin<br>Last Man Standing - GGRawinkin<P>GGRevealer (Villad) and GGNefertiti (Pyroth) also finished the race and were rewarded for their efforts.<P>We do not have their names because a representative of their guild collected their prizes, but I would like to give a special tribute to the top three finishers of the race as all were members of the Alliance of Amicus. They have done their guildmates proud. <P>Congratulations all and thanks to all racers, the citizens of Norrath for cheering/cajoling these racers on and to my guildmates for helping make this, our first running of the Gnaked Gnomes, such a successful event.<P>Avalan<br>GM, Starwarrior Guild<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gnome1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gnome2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gnome3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gnome4.jpg">Screenshot #4</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Avalan!

More posts have been made by Verant's Gordon Wrinn today.  Here's round two of today's Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032075.html"><b>Server Downtime</b></a><br>We announced several weeks ago that 1 or 2 servers would be coming down for about 4 hours per day for the purpose of performing several upgrades needed for Kunark. Our apologies to those who find this unpalatable, but it has to be done.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032095.html"><b>Religion Matters</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: My enchanter started out in the beginning as a worshipper of Erolissi Marr. Another person that I was traveling with at the time, a wizard, started out worshipping Solusek Ro. Around the same time (level 24 I believe), both of our religions were changed to Tunare. We petitioned then and the guide told us they'd log it as a bug, but that there was nothing they could do.]</i><P> There was a bug a while back that would cause the deity name to change spontaneously, but this was just a display bug. It didn't change what deity you actually have selected, because that is based upon a faction that is created at character creation. As for the Deity that is displayed, the GMs were correct in that they do not have the ability to change that. <P>In other words, should a deity-specific item be implemented, it will take into account your original deity, not the one that is displayed now were you affected by that bug.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032260.html"><b>Kerra Items & Erudites</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Ok Abashi, let me see if I've got this right. Kerra Isle has been re-done. GREAT!!! New Items were added that you had to quest for. GREAT!!! Some items are NODROP to prevent farming. GREAT!!<P>All Erudites are hated upon entering. GRE.... HUH?!?!?! This makes absolutly no sense.]</i><P> Sure it does. The Erudites are not known for their kindness, especially to the lesser races. With Kerrans being a tad "lesser" than most, it's not too big of a stretch to imagine that they really don't like the Erudites. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Some of these items are really nice and useful, but being a Erudite means I can never have them.]</i><P> Don't give up so soon. There are ways :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032217.html"><b>Druid Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why have druids not gotten any class specific armor quests as of yet, and will there be in the future?]</i><P> As to "why there isn't any", the answer, as simple as I can make it is the same reason that there aren't quests in other areas that there probably should be: We haven't put them in. Yes, it is entierly possible that we will put in druid class-specific armor at some time, in the same fashion that it is possible that we'll put in class-specific quests for gnome necros, or dark elf clerics. <P>The point I am trying to make is that just because something isn't in at present doesn't mean that we have no intentions of putting it in, just that we haven't put it in *yet*. EQ is an evolving game. New quests go in in nearly every patch. I do imagine however that druid-specific armor hasn't received much priority at this point due to the fact that the of adventured-armor available for them at that level is probably superior to class-specific armor we might put in. <P>Please trust that we have every interest in providing you with the content that will keep you interested and playing. We don't like hearing about people quitting because they feel that they've run out of things to do. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Why cant player bought houses be implamented?]</i><P> At a certain point in the development process the team has to start making decisions in regards to what features will be in the game. This lets them put some ideas to rest while allowing them to spend more time and devote more effort to things that are approved. Back in beta, it was decided that player-owned structures would not be a part of EverQuest, much like horses.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032030.html"><b>Annoying Footstep Sound Bug</b></a><br>The footstep/sound issues should have been fixed in today's patch. Sorry for the problem.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032038.html"><b>Item Crash Bug</b></a><br>Those item-based crash bugs that we implemented with the patch yesterday have been fixed in the patch today. <P>In your particular case, it was the totem that was causing you to crash.</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
A very unusual situation took place on the Lanys T'Vyl server recently.  Five guides were stripped of their rank and status and had all of their EQ accounts, guide and regular, banned.  The first report I've decided to post was sent by an anonymous resident of Lanys V'Tyl:  <BLOCKQUOTE>Ozzadyen, Calais, Desmo, Valdul, and Tygira--five Guides--were apparently stripped of their authority and fully banned from Everquest for participating in PVP action with regular players at the Lake Rathetear Arena on Thursday night of Lany's Tvl.  <P>This experience, prior to the banishment of the Guides, showed to us that Guides were players like us, that they cared about us, and that they like to have as much fun as us!<P>Whatever rule the Guides broke by battling players in the Arena does not justify the punishment handed down by Verant! What harm was done? Are Guides never to interact with players outside of either Customer Service Issues or Verant-sanctioned events? What about weddings? In many cased, GMs or Guides preside over or conduct the ceremonies. Will this now be cause for banishment? <P>All people on Lanys are sad to have lost 5 guides. We want them back! </BLOCKQUOTE>The second is a letter that has been written to the public by former Senior Guide Ozzadyen.  Here's a copy of it:<BLOCKQUOTE>I was once known as Ozzadyen a Senior Guide of Povar for a long time and Lanys T`Vyl for a very short time. I devoted almost a year of my time to helping others and giving them some enjoyment. I was released from the program for Improper behavior for going to the Arena and having fun with players on Lanys T`Vyl. <P>Now that I am no longer a part of the Everquest Guide program I can freely speak and I have every intention of doing so. First off Verant was on a Witch hunt to get me removed from the program anyway, because I was very unhappy with what had happened during the Rending of the Veil Part 4 on Xegony and let them know this. It was brought to my attention that there were 2 Councils on Xegony Councils of Light and Councils of Dark. On each of these councils were 5 players for a total of ten players. The Heads of these two councils were guides. At the end of the Veil 4 Quest a member on the Council of Light Allora was awarded the Title and Veeshan Claw. I found this very disturbing and wrong they have 10 Elite players on Xegony now and 1 was awarded a Title and an Artifact know as the Chyrstalline Claw of Veeshan. <P>Now while for the most part the Guide program is not to blame I will miss everyone there I worked with and knew for the last year. Go easy on those Guides, Apprentices and Seniors they are only doing what Verant directs them if they Deviate at all Like I did last night this is what happens to them. I have absolutely no respect for anyone at all in Verants upper Echelon, they rule with an Iron fist and use those in the Guide program without ever thanking them. Should something go wrong they immediately blame this huge Volunteer force they have. These Volunteer Players provide 85% or better of Verants Customer Service on a daily ongoing basis. I was told I was a disgrace I found this very amusing coming from the Upper Echelon of Verant GM staff. There are some GM's that are genuinely great and care about the players, but they are Temporary staff so even they live under the threat of a Hatchet day in and day out if they do not do what they are told.<P>But we learn, and we go on, perhaps you will hear more from me. There were others with me this night who helped provide great entertainment for several players not just 10 Elite ones like on Xegony. To Calais the Gnome Kicker, Tygira is Stark Raving Mad, Valdul, and Desmo, all these Guides, Verant immediately removed from the program, and Suspended their accounts. To them I give my deepest apologizes.  I was the Senior Guide, and had I not gone to the Arena none of the others would have followed because of me they lost there rights and access to there playing accounts I can in no way tell them how sorry I am and repay them for that. They were the best damn people you would have ever wanted to meet. Every last guide I had the pleasure of meeting and working with on Povar and Lanys T`Vyl in the last year were the greatest. The Senior staff and every last soul in the Guide program devote endless hours of devotion and time to help make EQ what it is today and they do this with Thanks from the players and not a single thank you from Verant. So ends the tail of Ozzadyen Servant to Lanys once Ozzadyen Servant to Povar, those always were my titles and I always lived up to them. <P>Now another thing that really gets to me is players are given warnings. As a guide in the program you are given no such Luxury not only was I immediately suspended but every account I had has been suspended, all of them, not just my guide account but every account I have. This fact alone is pretty interesting as a member in Verants CS program you are treated far worse then even the most stubborn player that refuses to share a spawn and disrupts an entire zone, even they are given the common courtesy of only having there one account suspended.<P>Ozzadyen no More.Safe travels in the Lands of Norrath friends and may thee be Karana's flood and wash over thy enemies.</BLOCKQUOTE>Obviously he broke the rules, but after reading this many EverQuest players are asking if such an extreme action was really necessary.  Guides aren't an abundant source.  They devote hours of their time each week to do service to the community.  Good ones are hard to come by, and harder to keep.  Certainly a program as important and vital to EverQuest must have rules, but because of one insignificant and pointless incident good guides can be banned instantly and without a second thought? <P>To voice your opinion of this issue please leave a news comment or visit a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5427887&replies=0">specially created board thread</a> on the Player Views Board.

Zanth sent me the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Zanth log:<br>Tuesday, April 11, 2000<br><br>There had been rumors of a new evil coming from Ak'anon, centerof the Gnome Kingdom. The rumors from weeks ago about the darkness near Erudin had been true. But there haven't been any more reports of strange happenings from Toxxulia Forest since we killed the Overlord in the Paineel. It seemed strange to hear of a 'new' evil from the heart of the Gnome Kingdom. The necromancers have always existed in Ak'anon and they are still no threat to Norrath...<br><br>This is what I can recall from the day the Gnome King fell.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>..Outside of town we prepared for our journey into Ak'anon. I glancedat the night sky and took a deep breath. Full moon, figures. Dear Karana,let us die well this night, and quickly.<br><br>Only five of us, not enough, not enough! The four others with me arepraised by some, unknown to most. They are good and I have great faith.The night passes quicky, we must go, time is of the essence.<br><br>..Inside we have problems early. The troll Uglar does not know when to sheath his blade and when to lay low. Perhaps it is the magic of the bloodfirethat drives the madness into him. Looking at his eyes you can see... small firesburning. Blade and whip swinging furiously, Uglar takes out bot after bot.He is not alone tho, next to him the barbarian Carressa shreds bots into scrapmetal. The first battle is over quickly; the two warriors had been hungry for some killing.<br><br>Quickly we moved towards the Palace. The whole way I had to listen to theranting of the drunken cleric Bannek. "Whars the ALE!" he says... "HAR HAR!" hecackles gleefully. If we didn't need him, I might have slit his throat. Damndrunk dwarves.<br><br>..There! The palace is in front of us. With the troll masked through druidmagic so he is not seen, the guards do not pay attention to him nor the others.It is common for barbarians, halflings, and dwarves to visit the Ak'anon.Through the front doors we walk in, smiling to the receptionist. "Are youhere to see the King?" she asks. I respond, "Why yes, we are," as I barelyhold back an evil grin. <br><br>Down, down, down we go, deep into the Ak'anon Palace. My heart is pounding now,glancing around you can not help notice the platemail wearing guards lining every corridor. _gulp_ ...Finally! We are before the throne room.<br><br>..Still hidden by the druid magic, the troll scouts about the throne room entrance.He's back and grinning. Trolls have really bad breath. "What are you so happy for?"I ask. Uglar says, "I found a torturer, here is proof of the evil!" "Lets kill it"We enter the torture chamber and lo and behold, one gnome torturer and two gnomeguards. Out come the swords and whips and the two warriors proceed to teach thegnome a little on the proper way of torturing. I'd hoped to get some informationfrom the gnome about the evil engulfing Ak'anon. Unforunately in the heat of battleCarressa put a six inch cut into his neck. Damn, the cut is too deep for the shamanwith us to heal the gnome. We decide to speak directly to the King.<br><br>..Hail King Ak'anon. King Ak'anon says, "Its druids like you who have ruined yourown lands! You will not ruin mine!" ACK!!!!!<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The battle that pursues is intense. The exact events I can not recall. When all was done, only 5 adventurers stood in the throne room, alone. At their feet liesthe corpse of King Ak'anon. With the evil King defeated the 5 friends looked at eachother, shrugged, and headed out after...<br><br>The Mayor of Rivervale (The TRUE Evil!)<br><br>Brought to you by,<br><br>Dead on Arrival,<br>First to conquer Paineel<br>First to conquer Ak'anon<br>========================<br>Zanth Zanth<br>Carressa Ba'shemgud<br>Uglar Ba'shemgud<br>Bannek Boulderbane<br>Shaman Incognito <UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/corpse.jpg">Screenshot #1</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Extreme roleplaying or powergaming, you decide.

Gordon Wrinn has made even more posts on the Gameplay Board today.  Here's round two of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031728.html"><b>Quivers and the Ammo Slot</b></a><br>We agree that quivers *should* be equipable in the ranged ammo slot. Unfortunately, due to the way that we store data on the character, an insurmountable techical issue made this impossible given our core architecture. With the way that we store data on the character, a full p-wipe would be required to change this, and as such the prospects of this happening have been ruled out.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029668.html"><b>Level 50 Experience</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I was just wondering what will happen to people that have a full experience bar in 50, will they automatically become 51 when they launch RoK or will the exp bar be reset?]</i><P>We won't be subtracting any experience points from anyone. The only *possible* thing that could happen is that we make an adjustement to the experience curve for level 50 prior to the release of Kunark which might make it appear that you have less experience. It is very unlikely at this point that we will do that. <P>We expect that when Kunark goes live that there will be many people who are but a kill or two away from level 51.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031880.html"><b>Will we ever see full screen interface windows for high resolutions? </b></a><br>Though I'll avoid saying that this is outright impossible, it is highly unlikely at this time. The design of EQ's interface uses custom bitmaps that have to be produced for each supported resolution. We don't want to do something cheesy like stretching these images out, as it will not only look bad but cause some technical problems.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031895.html"><b>Problem with Graphics: Missing Shields</b></a><br>We've had a few reports of this come in from other sources now, and our testing team is taking a look. <P>It appears that no shields are showing up. I'll get back with everyone when I have more information.<br>--<br>Update: <P>Turns out it's just the Shiny Brass Shield that isn't showing up. Trying to find out why now.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031889.html"><b>Future Server Splits</b></a><br>The server splits will take place prior to the servers first coming up, so people playing on them won't get surprised by a few hundred level 50s showing up. We'll announce more information when we have the servers ready to go.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031887.html"><b>What's up with Kerra Isle?</b></a><br>Yes, something indeed went wrong with the patch. Our operations personnel are currently in the process of patching the correct files. This can be fixed without bringing down all of the servers, as it only affects that zone.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031898.html"><b>How much hard drive space will Kunark take?</b></a><br>I have 622MB in my EQ directory. I'd say about 650 (for the data) to be safe.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031910.html"><b>More on loud footsteps</b></a><br>The problem with the loud footsteps was indeed something that we implemented today. It has been fixed on test, and will require a client download on the live servers for the problem to be fixed there. Unfortunately repatching the client will probably not occur until early next week. Our apologies to those who have to endure the loud footsteps in the meantime.</UL>

Gordon has been posting up a storm today on the Gameplay Board.  Here's excerpts and quotes from his latest round of posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031507.html"><b>When will the Hate drops be fixed?</b></a><br>In the data patch tomorrow. <I>(Note: this was posted yesterday)</I><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031636.html"><b>Future Servers</b></a><br>Yes, 4 new servers are planned in the very near future. Our current plan is for two of these to be split-servers (like Druzzil) and the other two to be clean-slate.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031658.html"><b>Camping Big Spawns</b></a><br>I really don't think that this is possible any longer. Some time ago we put in code that added a random component to the spawn timer for the longer spawns. Though I can't specifically announce the size of the random component, I can say that the window for a dragon-type spawn is in excess of 24 hours. That means that even if they had it timed before we did this, they'd have to sit around a LONG time.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031640.html"><b>Patches and the Expansion CD</b></a><br>The expansion CD will include all of the patches made through about the middle of last month when the master was burned.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031802.html"><b>Adding New Classes</b></a><br>Adding new classes is a very complicated process. It raises all sorts of balance issues that have already been dealt with concerning the original 14. <P>Except for the art, new races are comparatively easy. <P>In any case, we have no short-term plans to add new classes at this time.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031799.html"><b>Will there ever be Agnostic-only weapons?</b></a><br>No plans for this. We really don't see it making sense in the grand scheme of things. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031799.html"><b>Will we ever be able to change religions?</b></a><br>No plans for this either. It's really no different than someone being unable to wield/wear an item due to their selection of race or class.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031817.html"><b>Removing Rare Spawns from Tracking</b></a><br>It has long been our stance that the ability to track down rare spawns is a benefit of having tracking. Removing rare spawns from the tracking list as you request would negate that benefit.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031823.html"><b>Logging out in the PoH</a></b><br><i>[Quote from original post: My question is this: when i log in today, should i expect to instantly die to a horde of new roamers you put in there? that would, to say the least, suck...]</i><P>Well I of course can't comment on any specifics, but I would recommend that you arrange for a suitable army to meet you upon login.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031822.html"><b>Qeynos Hills to Western Karana Zone Bug</b></a><br>It hasn't been overlooked, it's just difficult to fix without requiring a 4+ MB download for everyone. It's on the list for repair.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031834.html"><b>Patch Message Inaccurate?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Also, for enchanters, DDD did NOT have its casting time reduced. The RECAST time was reduced. I'll post up a message about getting this changed in a minute unless Gordon reads this one.]</i><P> Doh! It's right on the list that GZ gave me, I apparently wrote it down wrong. I'll see about getting it updated after we wait a little while to see if I missed anything :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031835.html"><b>I cancelled my account, are my characters still there?</b></a><br>They are probably still there. To my knowledge we haven't yet had to clean up old accounts. That's not to say that we won't do it some day (I believe that we are only required to hold them for 90 days), but drive space hasn't become an issue at this point.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031841.html"><b>Changing the Terror Forged Mask</b></a><br>The same day that the terror mask was first found, we announced that the spell effect on it was a mistake and that it would be changed back. In addition, the NPC that hands it out had his quest dialogue changed to tell people acquiring it that the mask would soon lose its current spell effect and gain the power of fear. <P>Though it is true that we try to keep existing items as is, there are cases where an item is so severely overpowered that it must be changed in order to maintain the integrity of the game. This was such an example. <P>All of that said, I'm sorry that you are upset. It is next to impossible for us to insure that every player is made aware in advance for every issue in the game. We rely heavily on the news sites to help spread the word when something interesting happens.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031857.html"><b>Patch Issues</b></a><br>I'm chatting with the team about these issues now. Of the people that have noticed a problem with footsteps getting louder, what sound card(s)? Also, is it your footsteps, or others footsteps? <P>As for "No change to Kerra Ridge", it was patched incorrectly and is being redone now. We're still looking into the beggar.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031848.html"><b>Why does root and/or snare not have a "message" when it breaks like the DOTs and charm?</b></a><br>As they are offensive time-based spells, they should be issuing a message when they break. I've asked the programmer to look into it.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031847.html"><b>Blackburrow's History</b></a><br>Hahah, I remember when Blackburrow was the only dungeon. Dang, that was nearly 2 years ago.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031864.html"><b>Gating Spells</b></a><br>Good thought. We just gained this ability (a cast-on-others "go home" spell) recently. I've also raised the idea of a "Group Gate to the Wizard's Bind Point". I'm not winning that argument though, so please don't hold me to it :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031881.html"><b>Deity Restrictions</b></a><br>By choosing "agnostic" a person makes a choice to avoid both the positive and negative aspects associated with choosing a deity, in the same fashion that his selection of a race or class allows him to avoid the positive and negative aspects of another class. By the same logic that we do not allow people to change their race or class selection based upon new items or spells in the game, we likewise won't be allowing the change of deities based upon the same. <P>EverQuest is a game that is subject to change, and when a person makes a choice that choice not only affects them in the present, but for the future as well.</UL>

I received a report of a GM event from Malfane:<BLOCKQUOTE>I wanted to take a moment to thank the GM's on the Luclin server for the <br>outstanding job they have done thus far.<br><br>A fine example of this was the small scale event they held last Friday night <br>in Qeynos Hills, Blackburrow, and Everfrost.  Three merchants, the Goodbuys, <br>were walking through the Qeynos Hills area shouting that they needed an <br>escort to Halas so that they could deliver supplies to the Wolves of the <br>North.  A small group composed of many levels gathered around as they made <br>their way to the mouth of Blackburrow.  There the impromptu party set forth, <br>guiding and guarding the merchants through the home of the gnolls and out <br>into the mountains of Everfrost.<br><br>Here the fun began! The party was small, perhaps 15 people and by some odd <br>chance NO ONE was sure of the road to Halas.  The GM's were surely falling <br>out of their chairs with laughter as we made several stumbling attempts to <br>find Halas.  Finally we met a few kind Barbarian souls who guided us in to <br>Halas.  Throughout it all, we protected the merchants and had a lot of fun.  <br>The only sad point came when we suffered a single death due to someone who <br>was KOS approaching the guards too closely.<br><br>In appreciation for our efforts to guide and guard them, the merchants <br>handed out Black Pearls as a reward to many of their protectors.<br><br>This was a fine example of a well run and quite humorous GM event, with the <br>only death due to the GUARDS!<br><br>Thank you GM's of Luclin, keep up the good work!<br><br>Malfane<br>Warrior of The Way</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Malfane!

A new message was just added to the EverQuest Patch Server:<UL>April 10th, 5:30am<br>-------------------<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>The following is a list of changes that were implemented on the Live<br>EverQuest servers today:<br><br>*Spells*<br><br>- You will now receive a message when attempting to mesmerize a creature<br>that is immune to that type of spell.<br>- You can now right-click-and-hold on bard songs to determine what<br>instrument skill is used by the spell.<br>- Dyn's Dizzying Draught has had its casting time lowered significantly.<br><br>- Corrected a bug in the Druid root+damage spells (Enveloping roots<br>series) that caused the spell's damage to have a chance of breaking the<br>spell.  They work much better now.<br>- The Magicians Phantom Armor series now grants HP regeneration.<br>- The Druid spell, dance of the fireflies, has been changed from<br>"Outdoor only" to "Night only".  It may now be cast in dungeons.<br>- Corrected a typographical error that allowed high level magicians to<br>inscribe the Malosi spell.  It was not intended for magicians under<br>level 50.<br><br><br>*General Changes/Fixes*<br><br>- Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity.  If a deity<br>restriction is placed upon an item, it will show when you<br>right-click-and-hold on the item.<br>- The AC on the mid-level cleric quest armor has been increased.<br>- The Terror Mask will now cast "Fear" instead of "Call of Bones" as<br>previously announced.  The "Call of Bones" effect was placed on this<br>item by mistake.<br>- The Mempo of Likato now grants AC.<br>- The Quest for the Short Sword of Morin has been fixed.<br>- Some spawn-time problems in Mistmoore have been repaired.<br>- Five spawn-time problems were identified in regards to the Armor of Ro<br>(Paladin) quests.  They have been fixed and Paladins should have a much<br>easier time of obtaining their armor.<br>- Pets should now attack Willowisps on command.<br>- Many spell-gems and icons have been changed to reflect the appropriate<br>action of the spell.  Be sure to reacquaint yourself with your spell<br>line-up.<br>- Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to ignore the instrument<br>in use.<br><br><br>*Kerra Ridge*<br><br>Kerra Ridge has been completely revamped.  The target level-range for<br>the zone has been slightly increased.  In addition, many new quests have<br>been added to the zone.  The faction for Kerrans has been changed so<br>that those who killed them indiscriminately before today's update can<br>take part.  Be warned that the Kerrans still do not like everyone.<br><br>*Paw*<br><br>Paw has received another minor difficulty adjustment.  In addition, item<br>drop percentages have been increased.<br><br>*The Plane of Hate*<br><br>The Plane of Hate has received an item-drop/spawn-time revamp.  Take<br>care in your exploration of this zone as many things have changed.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Zykstar!

You CAN use a new credit card when you upgrade even though it asks for<br>the same one that is associated with your account.  To do this, you need to<br>go to the Account section from the main screen and change the credit card<br>you use for regular billing first.<br>3. To increase your chances of getting the Expansion on or near the 24th,<br>when we'll be turning on the new continent, we encourage you to upgrade<br>soon.<br><br>Thanks all - I'll see you on Kunark!<br><br>-Aradune</UL>

Gordon has made several more posts since the first infobit post today.  Here's what he's posted since the original news post:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031419.html"><b>More on International Shipping</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I can order RoK and have it shipped to a friend in the USA for $7, he can then send it to me for $10-$15, and it will get to me as fast (or faster) as the $57 S&H quoted to Australia.  Does Verant have any stance on this - is it perfectly ok for international customers to do this (ie no legality issues)?]</i> <P>We wouldn't have any problem with this. Our responsibility for the package would end upon it arriving at your friends in the USA. What he does with it after that is up to him. <P>As for your other questions, I believe Brad's post (part of which you've quoted) contains all of the information available to us at present. I apologize that I'm unable to elaborate further.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031470.html"><b>Kerra Isle Revamp</b></a><br>The revamp of Kerra will be going to the live servers tomorrow morning. There have been quite a few new things done with this zone. As for your specific questions, we prefer to leave them up to the players to figure out. I will say that we didn't overlook anything in regards to the Paw of Opalla, but I can't say whether or not it will still be obtainable after the zone goes live.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031472.html"><b>Why is CON not adjusted for group size?</b></a><br>There's a learning process. Players have to learn how to react in certain situations, and those decisions directly affect the difficulty of an encounter. For instance, I've seen a group of 18 attack and kill a dragon. I've also seen a group of 40+ fail to kill the same dragon. There's no way that an automated system can take group size and tactics into account and always provide an accurate /con statement, nor would we want it to. <br>--<br>Realizing that my list message might not have been too clear, by saying "nor would we want it to", I meant that we don't want to tell you in advance what the outcome of a battle will be to a mathematical certainty. <P>The /con message should represent the difficulty of an encounter assuming that the entity engaging in it is using the appropriate complement of people and tactics. Sometimes a solo player is the appropriate complement, sometimes it's a group. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031512.html"><b>Icon Issues</b></a><br>Your point is well-received. Though the looks of those items aren't to be changed at this juncture, our team has a directive to avoid using high level item graphics for lower level items going forward.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031634.html"><b>Future Server Splits</b></a><br>We haven't yet commented on what servers will be slated for split. We won't likely do so until the servers are ready to go.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031633.html"><b>Expansion Spell: Flaming Sword of Xuzl</a></b><br>Though I can't vouch for everyone's individual tastes, everyone around here thinks that it's pretty cool :)<P><Li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031626.html"><b>When will the retail version be on shelves and what races can the Iksar be?</b></a><br>The retail version is expected to go on sale in stores on 4/24, however I can't answer your question about classes at this time.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031625.html"><b>Data Patch Tomorrow</b></a><br>We are indeed including data (items, spawns, etc.) in the maintenance tomorrow.</UL>

Verant's Gordon Wrinn has made several new posts on the Gameplay Board today addressing several topics and issues.  Here's a quick rundown of them:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031337.html"><b>Caster Cap Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post:  Just wented to know if you can tell us whether or not the int "cap" of 200 (and similar stats) will be raised in the expansion.]</i><P>Casters will continue to get more mana per level, but there's no reason to raise the "int cap" that people speak of. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031592.html"><b>Why Should Anyone Under Level 40 Get RoK?</b></a><br>There will definitely be areas that you fight in and explore. We're starting an entirely new race over there, so lower level areas were a must. The new lands aren't exclusively high level.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031431.html"><b>Server Limit</b></a><br>1800 was the target that we agreed on pre-expansion, and we have no plans to raise that target after the expansion is released. We're pretty confident that the 4 new servers that we are bringing up (2 of which will be populated by allowing people from the more crowded servers to move to them) will help aleviate the existing overcrowding problems.<P> We will continue to address these and other issues as quickly as we can.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031563.html"><b>Skin Like Steel and Bravery Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post:  I have to tell them NOT to cast SLS while I'm in the group, or they will be hurting, not helping. Shouldn't SLS be cancelled by bravery? Or is there a component of SLS that I don't know that causes it to be stronger? (damage absorption, duration, some non-obvious number, because clearly SLS is inferior when comparing to bravery in hit points).]</i><P>The spell hierarchy compares all of the effects of the spell to determine the cases where one spell overwrites another. In this particular case, it sounds like the duration of Skin Like Steel is causing it to overwrite Bravery. <P>That said, it's not unusual to have to educate other classes that you group with on the capabilities of your class. My character, a necromancer, is sure to remind druids to avoid snare and other casters to refrain from root. Enchanters frequently have to remind all of their party members not to attack the mezed critters. In this case, you may have to remind druids above your level to forget SLS while in your group.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031552.html"><b>Kunark Spells</b></a><br>I should also clarify that we won't be commenting on them until a reasonable number of people have them and what they *really* do is widely known. This probably won't happen for some time after the expansion is released.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031581.html"><b>Rogues can be banned for pickpocketing?</b></a><br>No, they can't. I discussed this issue with the customer service team today, and they are in the process of getting the word out to the GMs and Guides to be sure that everyone is clear. <P>What rogues (or anyone for that matter) could be banned for is being anti-social and trying to cause problems, though these actions have to be judged at the time that they are committed.<P> For instance, there's no problem with you pickpocketing MobX. However if you chose to following around a group emoting "/em steals 3 platinum from a_gnoll_scout00", while taunting them in /say with "Haha, I'm stealing all your money", thus trying to ruin their gameplay experience, it could be considered harassment. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031579.html"><b>Verant.com Updated</b></a><br>We recently updated our web site at www.verant.com. We have quite a few job listings posted, as well as some other interesting information. We've also posted our "Featured Site" for the next week or so, da Grobb Skwad, a well done guild site for those greener of skin.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031462.html"><b>Give Clerics a Turn Undead Ability</b></a><br>Well we won't have this in the form that you ask, but there is a pretty nifty anti-undead spell that clerics can look forward to at later levels. I apologize, but as it is part of the expansion, I can't really comment on it quite yet.</UL>

Here's an excerpt:<UL>In addition to the rewritten user agreement that bans the sale of "characters, items, coin or copyrighted material" on eBay or anywhere else outside the game, the company is also going to the auction houses. <P>Smedley said that he plans to ask eBay to pull the game items off its site. eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said eBay would likely agree to do so. eBay has a policy of removing items for sale that are identified as intellectual property that is being unlawfully sold. </UL>In addition, our <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5047">Player View Forum</a> has been opened up to discussion of this issue.

Just a reminder to everyone, we <b>do not accept screenshots that are in BMP format</b>.  This is because of the huge amount of time it takes to download them and convert them.  The BMP must be converted into either a GIF or JPEG.  There are several shareware/freware image converters on the net, one such example is <a href="http://www.lview.com/">LView Pro</a>.  <br><br>Also, I know this will come as a big surprise to everyone that's tried to submit a screenshot in the last 4 months, but <a href="mailto:eqshots@vaultnetwork.com">eqshots@vaultnetwork.com</a> is officially back online. :)  From now on please direct all screenshot of the day submissions there.  Event screenshots that are accompanying a news report should continue to be sent to eqnews@vaultnetwork.com.<br><br>Thanks!

Brimstone sent me the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Tibbit of LOA reported the following event from Veeshan. I thought that theplayers of our community might also like to hear ofthis:<blockquote><i>Normally, I don't get too emotional over stuff in Norrath,but this was an exception.<P>I was minding my own business late last night soloing some birdies in LakeRathe when I came upon a small guild holding a funeral for one of theirguildmates. (It was located on the island with the bonfire.) I wish I couldremember the guild and the name of the fallen.<P>From what I could discern (I dared not interrupt), the guildmate was killed inRL in a horrible car/plane accident. Since it would have been supremely hardfor them to all attend a RL memorial, they held it in Norrath. His corpse wasthere (Human paladin, full plate), and the guild (45-50 people) was assembledin a circle. Prayers were read, memories were reflected on, and in general itwas really touching.<P>But what I thought was the most emotional was a silent 21 firebolt salute from7 of the guilds wizards. they all stood atop a rocky crag, and simultaneouslylet loose with three 7-bolt volleys across the zone of Lake Rathe. They wereall sent in the same direction, and all 21 bolts were visible for about 5seconds. <P>A guide/gm was then summoned, who placed the corpse in the fire and thenremoved the character. I guess it was about as close to cremation or a funeralpyre as norrath can get.<P>It was quite a sight to see, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a pangof emotion throughout the whole event.<P>=Tibbit=</i></blockquote><P>Submitted by Brimstone of <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/"target="_top">Akalabeth</a></BLOCKQUOTE>
