</FONT><HR>   Well to be honest, I don't mind the pet nerf as much as I mind the way it was handled.  I always found it crazy that my pet could pierce for the same amount as he could with his axe or scimitar.  <BR>   A number of problems have been identified with the enchanter class and I wish Abashi would address these.  Top among my list is why our resist rates are so high?  We are the only class that needs to lower MR so we don't get resisted as much.  I can understand high resist rates against yellows and Reds (that require Tashani) but Greens and Blues resist our spells way too much!  Other classes don't have to lower Fire resistance or Cold Resistance before they cast a spell!  <BR>   Anyways, I am not pleased with Verant.  Their game WAS great.  I await a better alternative.  It seems the overcrowding problem will be solved as soon as a new game comes out.  My guess is this is why Verant has done so little to address overcrowding.  <P>------------------<BR>Llaorn Mistwalker<BR>35th level Enchanter<BR>Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000051&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I am basically going to restate some of Baelish's comments on this post in a more violent manner.<P>We are supposed to be a grouping class.<BR>VERANT!!!!! DO NOT FORCE ME TO GROUP ANY MORE<BR>Sometimes I just dont have any friends online at a certain time. What can I do? Absolutely JACK. Sure I can go risk life and limb trying to solo specs or something, but if I get resisted one time in the fight, im dead, battle is over, time wasted. And even with this last patch, not compensating enchanter pets, verant is then again FORCING us into a group role.<P>Lets face the facts. We don't moan groan gripe or complain so they assume we are happy. Well, we are happy to an extent. I think we THOUGHT that Verant had enough common sense to read through /bug and /feedback forms (I think I have about 8 bug forms and 6 or 7 feedback ones) and figure out what was wrong. Well, WE were wrong, we have to gripe, complain, and do what everyone else does to get buffed up.<P>You can have a sit in, but that is not the answer. Crashing a server is no real way to solve a problem. More like all enchanters take a weekend and say to hell with grouping, and we just solo for a weekend, or a week. Or try to since we get resisted so much. <BR><P>------------------<BR>Tarenesk Ulander<BR>Tarew Marr Enchanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000052&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>My question is why we even have animations. Several people have posted that they do not use them. I don't. I haven't summoned one in 10 levels or more, and if I started a brand new Enchanter, I could get by without them in the early levels too. I don't even try to solo. If I log on and no one is there to group with, I do the same thing I do on weekends when everything is camped: I jewel. That's how I hit a skill of 197 at level 27. Animations are as useless to me as Sense Magic. But then again, Sense Magic is only one spell. Why do I have an entire line of 12 useless spells? I don't mind that our pets were nerfed. I mind that pets are considered to be useful in the first place. I like a lot of Baelish's suggestions, and there have been some other good ones in this thread. A retuning would be nice. If nerfing our animations didn't bring us out of line with your vision of Enchanters, do something to bring us IN line with your vision. More enchantments don't seem like too much to ask for. I like the idea of temporary enchantments, as well. More like a buff for weapons and armor. Very cool without flooding servers with powerful items. Mez spells can be improved upon, as well. Enchanters are crack dealers and crowd control? Make us the best at those roles, then. Our Lulls should at least be brought up on a level equal to Druids. Mez should have a minimum duration. Why are my spells All or Nothing? These are just a few suggestions taken from previous posts.<P>All in all, I like playing an Enchanter. But the issue of pets is ridiculous. They are detrimental to a group, and Verant made the Enchanter to be a group class. So why do we have twelve spells that are OUT of line with Verant's defined role for us? Doesn't make sense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000053&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>All ABASHI had to do was increase the damage per hit for the mages.  dual weild was irrelevant. Instead they nerfed necros and us enchanters. . . they say that they are now happy with the pets yet compensate necros for part of their loss!  -Only a fool (or a very bad necro) could think our animations compared at all with a necro pet before or after the patch!<P>If dual weild really mattered that much in NPC's, they wouldnt have been so lazy when fixing the problem in mobs! In that case they decided not to give dual weild becuase the mobs already did the damage intended. If they had granted dual weild they would have had to rebalance all the other attack stats of a  mob.   But for mages (curse the bastard that reported the "bug") low and behold! suddenly its fine to "rebalance" the damage done so that they can dual weild!  ABASHI! YOU CANT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS! STOP LYING TO US! YOU ARE SUCH A HYPOCRITE!<P>We are enchanters! we should have the fasted pets! certainly not the strongest, or the most hp, but definately should be the fastest! How can they honestly say the dagger delay was a bug? It was so well known! every guide on playing an enchanter on the web reminds you to give it a dagger!  (oh ya, if they could do what they did with alchemy, maybe they could be this stupid here)<P>The quicken spells are part of the defining nature of us enchanters . .. of course we should be able to speed things up more than anyone else (oops,  more verant hypocracy. . . . we are less meaningful since they added so many haste objects . ... if i dont get my dagger delay boost back then to be fair melee classes must loose their haste objects!)<P>Verant must either speed up the natural attack of our animations,  give them more str and hp, and make them taunt better. They should still be weaker than mage and necro pets of course (always were, always should be).<P>As a part time solo enchanter, i dont mind having to tank for my pet a bit, i dont expect to cower in the back ground like a mage or necro.  But since the patch, my pet cant taunt off me at all! without the delay boost from daggers, even with alacrity my pet cant damage fast enough to taunt off me!<P>To all of you who think the quicken spells make dagger delay meaningless . . . . (must be warriors) . ..  my pet will now do 37% (!!!) less damage than before because it attacks slower.  This means that everyone in a party will have to pay in their own blood and sweat by the mob being killed that much slower.<P><BR>Camping in dungeons. . . can be done just fine if you dont wander around with your pet (hence the name camping). I havent been told not to cast a pet in a dungeon since i was lvl 12 and idiots thought that the pet would steal all the experience. Often im asked to cast that pet right away to help out!<P><BR>i could go on and on and on ... but for now im done.<P>Suraka Akarus<BR>lvl 27 enchanter Quellious<BR>PAYING CUSTOMER SINCE JUNE 199</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000056&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Never in my entire 2 years of playing everquest have i seen such a silent nerf to ANY class, let me clear this up for you enchanters, not only did our PETS get nerfed.. but our TASHANIA has been reduced by about 20 or so MR and our ILLUSIONS make us pretty worthless on recon in the plane of hate now.<P>I want verant to follow a lvl 50 enchanter around and see how group effective that enchanter is. Tonight.. i took a voyage to kedge keep with my guild-- i was resisted on EVERY SINGLE spell that i attempted to cast there IE- Alure Dazzle Color shift Slow spell Incapacitate EVERYTHING -- ONE mob i mezzed and i wont even say which one because it will get nerfed. The only thing i was able to do was buff, yes thats right buff, Crowd controll? i think not, debuffer? i think not Charmer? yeah uh huh thanks Verant that one got me killed today a few times. and now the only thing you CAN cast during fights (runes and berserkers, ohh wait forgot to mention berserker spirit has had its magical skin nerfed, thanks again verant i love you) is so convienently pillaged away by phinigil, nagafen, vox, you name it -- making us completely useless, and they say they are happy with the class now, well thanks cuz i cant do **** anymore.<P>ohh and another thing, you nerf necros and give them 4 spells and pet casting abilities to compensate for it? what the hell do we get?

</FONT><HR>As an Enchanter these are the things I do not need my pet to do:<P>1. Actually kill things MOBs<BR>2. Actually Kill me<P>The Second of course happens WAY more often than the first as my pet cannot be told NO.  Asimple word yet common seems to complicated for my little animation..ok I can handle that....but given that Necros,whom many ppl consider to be among THE most powerfull classes in the game, are being compensated for their loss I think it only fair that the Enchanters of Norrath recieve the same fair treatment and here are a few Ideas<P>1. Change my Pets agenda, ie what do I throw myself upon so master can escape, to reflect the MObs hate list SO if I wipe its hate list my pet Leaves it ALONE...I pretend no knowledge of Programming I do not know if this would be hard....perhaps it would be easier if a pet is just unable to attack a mesed target so a "smart pet" would say That is not a valid Target...<P>2. AE Tashanisomethingorother  Thats right...if my group is fighting multiple MOBs why can't I just cast a AE Tash.  Wouldn't that be handy.  Think about it.<P>3. Min duration for charm 20 seconds. WoW.  I hate seeing I cast a spell then Your Charm has run out ( Tho I am so overjoyed that I quiver when I do have this message rather than not)<P>4. Please let me enchant items other than jewelery like our name implies...I do not really consider this a fair compensation as I feel we should have had this from the get go, but I am sooo desperate I'd take anything about now.<P>5.  Ok this is just on my wish list...a Ench only Robe that has Clarity Built in.<P>6. Group Clarity<P>7. While I haven't seen the high lvl Charms in action knowing there is such a cap is unsettling so...ah well...<P>Those are just some ideas take em or leave em....they'll prolly get left I know....Oh and pardon my ignorance should I be missing something like hey that is int he game already...sorry in advance.<P>Magistar Mindmaster of Povar<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000058&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Was the enchanter nerf a good thing?  Yes, for two reasons.<P>1) Logic - giving a pet a low-delay weapon SHOULD decrease damage output at the same time that it increases attack speed.  This was not the case, and Verant addressed it properly (though somewhat rudely).<P>2) Role - get this through your skulls, enchanters: you are NOT a solo class.  Your pets were far too powerful considering your primary spells.  Imagine yourselves lucky for your short time "off the leash".<P>Should enchanters be compensated for what they lost?  I don't think so, for two reasons.<P>1) They didn't deserve to have what they "lost" in the first place.<P>2) Unlike the necromancer, who lost some soloing capability and required additions in order to become more group-friendly, enchanters were already (and remain) very desirable to any intelligent and well played group.<P>However, regarding what enchanters should rightfully have, when the hell is Verant gonna get off its duff and put in item buffs for enchanters?!  Makes perfect sense!  Let enchanters cast buffs directly on items (weapons and armor mostly) to add special effects to them.  Resistance and ac buffs for armors, delay and damage buffs for weapons, plus special properties for items of all types.  Allow enchanters to add lesser sow and regen effects to boots and chestplates respectively, to apply one time dot or dd procs to weapons, etc, etc.  The buffs should have limited durations roughly on par with current buff averages.  These item buffing capabilities would go a LONG ways towards both fulfilling the enchanter's role and increasing the class's viability.  I maintain that a well-played enchanter is still the nastiest non-npc you will ever encounter in EQ, but they should start enchanting items in addition to other beings.<P>[This message has been edited by Torent (edited 02-02-2000).]<p>[This message has been edited by Torent (edited 02-02-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000061&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well I want to add my 2 cents worth as a 21 enchanter, my pet pre nerf was dying with a dagger and quickness unless I cast every debuff I could memorize, and that was only with blue, and as for the reply that everquest is a grouping game, I too work 40+ hours a week and have a wife and children, I may only get an hour or 2 to play at any given time, and you cannot find a good group in that time, when I did have more time, I was not wanted by most groups due to my inability to cast clarity, and the group not needing crowd control or quickness, what option does that leave?  I have watched a class slowly slide down hill for a year now, and verant has gotten almost $150.00 of my money while causing grief and depression instead of the relaxation and entertainment it had in the beginning.  How this nerf is handled will determine wether I keep my account or close it up and NEVER BUY ANOTHER VERANT, 989, OR SONY PRODUCT AGAIN!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000062&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Argh.. that does it. My best friend plays a mage, and he is laughing his ass off at me, the enchanter. He out level'ed me, through levels 20-29 (I'm level 20, he's 29). Pre-Patch, I could solo decently. I can solo things yellow and white to me even, only IF I gave my pet a dagger.. and quickness of course.. then I would stun stun nuke stun stun berserk str, stun, nuke dead. Now.. it goes more like stun stun berserker str stun nuke stun nuke pet dies, root, nuke...nuke...nuke...nuke dead. I don't want to play a wizard, nor do I like the prospect of grouping more than I have to, so, with this 'enhancement' to mages (along with the healing spells they got..) I will no longer play my enchanter.. maybe start a mage or necro, since *they* seem to be getting new spells. I liked the obscure power of enchanters.. where most people didn't think I could take that mob, I did.. with enough mana left to mez/mem blur the mobs off of the on-lookers. But no... now, as far as I'm concerned... we don't have any pets anymore, a almost 'complete' waste of mana and tiny daggers.. Sure, in a group, they will train TONS more stuff than mage pets, because they average lowerlevel, with same level mages. But no.. the *minority* of Norrath gets it in the end after all.... and the most popular classes are being boasted even more. (Mages pets dual wield, heal pets, necros 'new line of group friendly' spells, etc..) There's alot of Necromancer's out there.. more than Enchanters on most servers. And now... Mages will be the new fad. "Hey everyone!!! Mages just got kickass spells and better pets!!! come on! join the party! choose a mage!" There you have it.

I couldn't, I watched a enchanter who didn't use a pet and observed his stratagy which was like a wizards, root Tashan, Root DOT, DD, lower level DD, DD, lower level DD. My method was to summon a pet find a mage so I could get a dagger for my pet. Then I would tashan something DOT Debuff and watch my pet go and finsh off the MOB. Even then my pet would come out of the battle pretty beat up. The difference between the 2 I never died with my method, I used about 2 bars of mana while the other enchnater used 4 and I got better exp on the account of a lower down time. Now, after our pets have been turned from a invisiable warrior to a invisable bunny Lower level soloing is a lot harder.<BR>I see a few options at this moment that VERENT should think about fufillinf.<P>1. Make our pets better. IE return them to their formar stauts, or enchanceing them such a necro pet has been enchanced.<BR>2. Take out our Sight Line of Spells (WTF was VERENT on when they made these spells?)and add something better. One such thing which would be cool would be change our mana seive spells so that the mana which as been stole goes to us.<BR>3. Make our spells less resistable.<BR>4. Give charm a mimimum duration, I would say like 5-7 mins<BR>5. LET US ENCHANTE WEAPONS, ARMOR, SHEILDS, ect.<BR>6. Give us more DD's more Dots.<BR>7. Upgrades to clarity so that bards can't out do us.<BR>8. Upgrade to Quickness line of spells so a dumb belt can't out do us.<BR>9. Give us a necromancer spell. You gave Necromancers a form of charm it would be only fair that we get something of theirs in return.<BR>10. Make more better illusions. When I say better I mean that they actually do something ie stats.<BR>I hope that you (VERENT) will start listening to your custormers advice before we all get mad and open up a CAN OF WOOPAS$.<P>            </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000065&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>First, Who Cares!?! Ok so they nerfed the pets. Yeah! About friggin time I see a necro start doing something other then /pet attack! Mages are the pet users they should have the most powerful pets!<P>Second, who uses the enchanter pets anyways? They run off, are always aggro to critters, and weak to begin with. Get a group! Its not hard. Go to MM or Sol A and yell your a crowd control enchanter. Sit down mez a large pull, charm some low gobo and have it smack its buddy, rise and repeat!<P>Third, one friggin nerf! They nerfed us once and everyone is up in arms (us being enchanters). No one complains that all we get from the solusek Ro quests is a mask and gloves and 2 poor weapons. No robes nada. No one complains that we don't have enchant weapon spells yet. No one complains that vicious mana line is useless and I have yet to find. Anyone wonder why is takes almost a full 2 bubbles to cast enchanter &lt;bar name&gt;? Is it that mana needy? These are questions we should be asking not 'why can't we have our pets unnerfed?'<P>Tssa Spellbinder</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000066&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Whoohoo nice to see enchanters enthused!<P>It appalls me that we get nerfed because our pets "might" do more damage than a necro pet in the three rounds before it dies. <P>Face it, necros are still a "god class". Its not like enchanters can stack 2500dmg in DoTs on a mob at 49 AND have a pet hitting for 55 while the mob is feared and snared.  <P>Abashi even has the nerve to lie and say enchanters get better speed buffs. According to Baelish's own numbers the lvl34 augment death buff drops a base necropet to 18dly - exactly the same as the lvl49 enchanter spell Swift Like the Wind. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000067&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

I will respond to the points below with my perspectives on this.  I would however like to start by saying the greatest immediate impact on me is NOT in gameplay but in morale and optimisim I once had for playing the class.<P><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><B>Personally, I gave a dagger to my pet maybe 5 times from level 1 to 16. Most of the time it was killed instantly by something. From that, the trouble of buying them in town, etc. I just stopped doing it. I ALWAYS get rid of my animation if I am in a group, so that I can have Charm available if I need it. </B><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I kept a good supply of rusty and bronze daggers in my backpack, and whenever I encountered a magician, I would offer to buff their pet in exchange for a couple summoned daggers.  With the combination of mages and bandit/derv camps, I rarely was in need of daggers from about lvl 12 onward.<P>What little grouping I did was done outdoors where my pet was a welcome addition to the group.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><B>I do not use Charmed monsters as normal pets, I simply use Charm as a stopgap method to remove one monster from the attacking group and use it to dish some damage out to its companions. As for my personal opinions on the matter, I think that animations should be weak, barely strong enough for us to solo with.  These are not elemental forces from another dimension, or even foul undead. It's a silly little shield and a weapon. I was suprised it worked as well as it did.</B><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I've yet to use charm for any purpose other than amusement where it did not result in my death or runing to zone.<P>I don't think the idea of an animation was the best way to go for a pet to begin with.  What I think SHOULD have been given to enchanters is commandable illusions of actual monsters with a fraction of the hp that the real monster would have had, yet being statisticly identicle in other respects.<P>Back to the gameplay part of this, the difference in a 30 delay attack vs a 23 delay attack was helpfull, but not essential.  What it DID do for me was allow me to make use of a weaker than maximum pet by enhancing him with a dagger to bring him up on damage lvl to meet or execeed the highest lvl pet I could summon without one.<P>In the times I found myslef needing to break a camp of 3 high blues solo, I made sure to have the best pet I coudl get AND give him a dagger.<P>I will admit that when using my pet in a group, I only gave him a dagger if whatever we were fighting happened to drop one.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><B>As for enchanters not dealing out much damage, and having one of their major sources of damage taken away, again, I feel this is not a concern.</B><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>We both speak from the view of being experienced but lesser enchanters.  What needs to be looked at here is how it affect BOTH low and high lvl enchanters.  Before lvl 16, we have no speed spells whatsoever to mae up for the loss.  At 16th we get quicken, I'm nto sure how this compares to the speed gained be even a rusty dagger, but I believe it is less than even that gain.  At higher levels the speed form the next quickness MIGHT equal the gain of the dagger, but the loss is even greater when you think of what used to be possible.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><B>As an Enchanter, I feel my role is not doing damage but preventing it. </B><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>As an enchanter I feel my role should be influencing the tide of battle without activly having to attack the monster myslef.  This definition fits crowd control, it also fits controling a solo battle so that my pet is my puppet that I have turned into whirling blades of death attacking a monster I have debilitated to the point of being a pathetic excuse to its own kind.  Unfortunatly I dont have enough good buffs to bring my pet to this point, OR enough good debuffs to bring a monster to that point. (maybe if stats actualy meant somethign in the game our buffs and debuffs would make us what we should be)<P><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><B>Nearly all our spells revolve around preventing damage, by weakening or slowing a monster, stunning it, or removing it from the fight entirely. If there is any other damage caster in the party, I drop Sanity Warp so I can memorize another debuff. And I have yet to see why Whirl TYH is such a bad spell. This is probably my second-most used spell. About 1/3 of the time it takes the monster out of action for the rest of the fight. I have NEVER had it last less than twice the duration of the AE stun, unless someone in the group is silly and bashes it or stuns it. And it costs 5 more mana than Languid Pace. Languid is a nice spell, but in terms of sheer numbers of attacks, it would have to be a much longer combat than mine typically are to effectivly remove as many attacks as Whirl does. </B><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In this I do not agree, I just dont feel I should have to be limited to doing it in groups to be able to be effective.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><B>I have actually been in several groups with a second enchanter, and from my experience they tend to rely on their damage spells. I see lots of Choke, lots of Chaotic Feedback. I have been with enchanters who didn't have their AE stun or Mesmerize memorized, and who have never cast a single debuff while I grouped with them. Now granted, they may not have needed to after they realized I was more than happy to take over this role. In any case, the point of all this was to say that in my fairly low-level opinion, Enchanters are by FAR the best at damage prevention, with so many different ways to stop it.</B><BR>[QUOTE]<P>In this I snese that you do not have a full appreciation of thse spells.  I would liekt o point out a couple things that you and many others overlook ont eh two offensive spells you mentioned.<P>Although choke is a DoT, it is also one fo the most effective DEBUFFS you have at these levels (I'd go so far as to say that choke,  disempower and languid peace are the ONLY debuffs I have at lvl 18 that I percieve ANY difference after casting)  And compare its cost and benefit to the other two options.<BR>I generaly use choke to pull with since it seems to have an incredibly low resist rate.<P>Chaotic feedback is a bit of a different matter.  At the level you get it at, it is very usefull.  It is actualy MORE mana efficinet than the DD spell a mage gets at the same level.  I generaly use a DD as a finisher when a monster approaches 1/4 hp or starts to run.  At my present level, I switched to using root on runners.<P>[QUOTE]<BR><B>Shamans are second-best, but they don't get as many options as we do. Nobody else even touches it. I really enjoy doing this, and that is why I play an enchanter. I don't want to sell enchanted weapons or items and make a ton of money. I don't want to run around with a mega-pet and solo yellows.

For example a pet with a dagger might hit fast but for 50% damage, while a pet with a two-handed sword might deal 150% damage, but hit VERY slowly. This is probably FAR too much trouble to insert into the code, and thus would never happen, but would allow pet users to customize their pets MUCH more.

</FONT><HR>Well Abashi needs to look into a few things , but I dont believe its pets. The whole team at Verant seems to think that enchanters and bards are for groups only when in all cases all players have to solo once and a while, and some like to solo alot. If we are going to be considered group orientated then we need more group stuff screw the pets, take em away and give us ..say..group clarity or group swift like wind.

Also im tired of hearing about what verants "vision" for such and such class, what is so hard to understand that release was close to a year ago and to change characters the way they do is unexceptable, verant is a very odd company with a strange notition of how to run things .. a garbage manual that really doesnt tell us anything usefull , a little back ground history with in itself totally of no use or value considering there is no PLOT to EQ no GM run story line to satisfy Role players ..

</FONT><HR>Wait a minute here, let me understand this correctly:<BR>1.Magician pets were changed so that they could do more damage.<BR>2.Necro pets, as a side effect, were affected by the dual wield change, so they were given pets that proc spells (at 44 and 49) and this new "group friendly" line of spells to compensate<BR>3.Enchanter pets (animations) were affected by the dual wield change, so we're told that our quicken and augmentation line of spells is good enough?<BR>I'm sorry, but this is not acceptable. One of the main reasons I stopped playing my enchanter was because on a PvP server, we lost the full use of two lines of spells, equaling 7 spells in all. And now, when I think about possibly returning to him, I find out that the class that was tremdously affected by previous "nerfs" (charm/fear changes specifically), is nerfed once again?<BR>We're aware our animations are rediculously underpowered (I didn't use them untill 12, the fact that I can't give them commands still disturbs me, but I deal with it), but downgrading their power even further simply makes no sense. What is the purpose of an animation now? Are we relegated to chain casting animations, constantly summoning and suiciding them untill the mob is dead?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000071&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>It never ceases to amaze me how many narrow minded people there are in the world (in this case, Norrath).  Why do so many people think that there is only one way to play each class, and that's the way it should be, that their way IS that way, and everyone who wants to play different should shut up, quit whining, and conform?  Personally, I think every class should be able to solo, and every class should be able to contribute in a group.  Sure, some classes should be better at one, and some should be better at the other, but both should be options.  I'm SICK AND TIRED of you narrow minded people who enjoy planting your ass in one spot for hours on end and simply medding, mezzing, and casting clarity telling those of us who enjoy soloing that we should switch to another class because that's not our role as enchanters!!  If you enjoy playing that way, that's great, you chose a class that's good at it, and the rest of us don't tell you to not play that way.  Where do you get off telling us we shouldn't solo, and we have nothing to be angry about when our ability to solo has been nerfed in a major way?  <BR>Personally, I group sometimes (when my time permits, and I can find a group, I DO have a wife and children), and I solo sometimes.  I enjoy both, and am quite good at both.  Now, I can't solo anymore, except spectres, because that's the only thing you can use charm on without dying all the time (they are so slow, you can run to zone when the charm screws you on every other attempt).<P>Due to the time constraints of my family, full time day job, and such, I soloed most of the way from 1-29.  It wasn't easy, NOWHERE NEAR as easy as if I had been playing a mage or necro, but that's why I chose an enchanter.  I knew that soloing would take more thought and planning, more care, and would be much more challenging.  I knew that I could also contribute well in a group.  I had a wider selection of spell lines than other classes, even though most were weaker in comparison to some classes.  I could play the way I wanted on a given night, instead of having to do the same damn thing night after night after night....<P>Now, it seems that those in control at Verant have also become narrow minded asses who feel they have to force enchanters to conform to THEIR vision of how an enchanter should be played.  Which is to say that an enchanter should never do anything but group, night after night.  Who were we hurting if we chose to solo sometimes?  I know that when I soloed, I gained xp at 1/2 to 1/3 the rate of necros and mages, so why is everyone *****ing that my pet allowed me to solo?  <P>I wish people would realize that enchanters can do SO MUCH MORE than just mez, stun, clarity...at least we could if our resists weren't so ridiculously high in comparison to other classes, and if our pets hadn't been nerfed to the point where we can't solo with them anymore.<P>Am I the only one who can't stand sitting on my ass in a little room for hour after hour, standing only to mez, stun, buff?  What is it that makes so many people willing to do that night after night?  I did that four times, all for jboots, and after I got my boots, I swore I would NEVER camp again, for any reason.  And you know what?  I never have.  Therefore, I can rarely get into groups, because at any moment, 99% of the people who are in a group are camping, either for items, or xp.  <P>Even when I can play for a few hours at a time, I can't stand to stay for long in the same area looking at the same things and killing the same monster (with the same name) over, and over, and over...I have to travel to a different place every hour or two to keep from being bored.  What is wrong with that?  Grouping means staying in one area for long periods of time.  Why should I have to do that in order to play an enchanter?  I don't mind doing that occasionally, but Verant (and many players, too, it would seem) think I should do that 100% of the time.<P>The bottom line is that there are multiple ways to play enchanters (and most other classes), they can all be fun, and nobody should stereotype this class as only being acceptable for one of them.  If you enjoy sitting on your ass in the same spot all night, fine.  If I enjoy running from zone to zone and soloing, fine.  Some people enjoy both (ME!), fine.  Well, now 2 options have become one.<P>LET'S ALL CONFORM TO VERANT'S VISION OF WHAT WE ALL SHOULD DO AND BE!!<P>HEIL VERANT!!<P><BR>Landros Simulacre<BR>Disenchanted AND disgusted enchanter on Mithaniel Marr<P><BR>-Greetings, Comrade!
