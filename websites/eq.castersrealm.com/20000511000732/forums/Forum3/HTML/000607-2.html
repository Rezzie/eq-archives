</FONT><HR>"Maybe someone posted this allready and I missed it but the ability to solo never has been what Verant has used to classify "balance"."<P>I don't think you can divorce or ignore soloing when talking balance in practical terms, because it forms part of the game, and more importantly, has an impact on a given class' balance vs others in the medium to long term.<P>This is because a class that solos well can (as mentioned before) take on mobs when groups are difficult to find or overcamped, and gain an advantage in xp/loot, leading to increased purchasing power and so afford to equip themselves better than the other classes.   This does not always happen, but it is a realistic outlook.<P>This is also why, I think, balance in soloing is as important a consideration as balance in groups, because the less solo-able classes have to limit their playtime to when their friends are on, or play only in the middle of the night when the servers arent crowded?<P>Ok, you may say this is an overcrowding issue.  Fair enough.  However, overcrowding exists, there doesnt look like being any real solution in sight, and while it exists, the ability to solo is much more important, espectially at those times of day when most people want to play.<P>On the subject of enchanter soloing, I agree you have to plan your assaults with care, but sub-29 there are many good places to solo which are not so crowded.<P>For example, one of my prime choices for a teenage enchanter is Rathe Mountains.  There are at least 2 places to sell in zone.  Ogguk is close for bank runs (and illusion/alliance make this relatively harmless for lighter races).  <BR>There are at least 3 lizzie camps in  zone (though one is in hg territory, so I dont advise that one unless there is an hg group nearby - if there is, there is an excellent chance they will buff you up too, and they will like be 35-45 levelwise). <P>Lizzies are great up up 14, and ok up to 16 (though you will start getting lots of greens...much like the orcs in ec).  After that there are basilisks which don't gang up on you.   Not all the valleys have giant skels and cyclopses in them, some are quite peaceful.<P>For the 7-12 range there is the corner of Ferrott zone (entering from Rathe, turn hard left and go to corner).  That is a magic place with 3 ruins all of which spawn skellies, and is almost never ever camped.  You can make a level an hour easy there (getting there at lvl 8 is easy enough, at lvl 7 or less is riskier without a sow/invis from some kind soul)<P>Basilisks in Rathe are plentiful and non-aggro so they can get you solo to 19 or 20, after which it's probably time to revisit highpass, and work the gnolls or orcs for a couple of levels - if you cant get a group here (soloing is hard here...ks-hell in peak times) then you can at least build up your faction until a vacancy opens up.  Alternatively, East Karana is also seldom overcamped, and from 18-24 there is plenty to solo (and fairly safe if you base yourself near beholder gorge gully - dont base near bridge as people train thru u to zone).<P>Also, if faction is not vital to you, the prisoners near highpass keep bank are ok to solo from approx 18-22 (but you have to be careful as one is pretty tough the others are easy).<P>The lookout room under the bank is great to group from around 21-24 but soloing its a nogo zone.  At 24 go to the paw spires and group there (or treants if you dont mind bad druid faction).<P>If you cant find a group you can solo some aviaks or elephants, though the supply is unreliable.  Putrid skels are much more reliable supply but I doubt its that easy to pull a manageable quantity (I've watched it but never done it myself).<P>Some of the gnolls in lakerathe are takeable...if there is a group there, they may let you grab what is green to them (they are probably after the embalmers or shamen anyway).<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000607.cgi&ReplyNum=000026&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Should+soloing+be+an+indicator+of+class+balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think Soloing ability should be considered as PART of the balance issue. People DO SOLO and it strikes me as unreasonable to assume that you couldn't learn anything in a solo fight (and thus gain xp). But EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE it does give an indicator of group usefulness.  There are obvious exceptions where classes have specialities (cleric enchanter) that REALLY come into play in a group and are less useful solo but merit a serious weakness in other areas (dd ac hp..).<P>Consider the interdependancies however:<P>A warrior NEEDS a healer (yes you can group with non-healers and gain by it but you will still have large downtime -can be compnesated for by easy kills and bandages to some extent). And he ONLY gets melee ability.<P>Clerics can use anyone pretty much though a tank may be optimal but they do get DD and Melee to some extent anyway.<P>Other Healers can Solo or group with anyone.<P>Druid AMAZINGLY useful both in and out of group: snare and SoW very useful for both they also get good damage spells and buffs (ditto shaman to differing extents).<P>A well controlled pet can be ALMOST as good as a PC tank and you get the caster thrown in for free! Sure there are times when a Warrior is much more useful to the group but the margin is not that great. There is PLENTY that a "Pet class" can do beyond the pet in terms of damage. They only miss out on the taunt skill (not sure if non-enc pets taunt but I don't think it is as good as a PC tank anyway)<P>Taking the warrior as the extreme example:<P>To all those who dismiss people's complaints as irrelevant cos they mention solo ability:<P>1) Would it hurt the balance so much to have the warrior tougher than the pets and able to solo things (with serious Damage) that a mage can solo at teh expense of meditatable mana?<P>I don't see why. Would you be unwilling to take a mage with damage shields and DD? Would you be MORE LIKELY to turn down the necro with his DoT, Healing and self-sufficiency just because the warrior is tougher than his pet?<P>So if it wouldn't make the warrior much too powerful why not let them be able to solo better? Make them a bit tougher! They will be BETTER in group and NOT so powerful that they squeeze others out. They STILL need Healing. They STILL take damage. They STILL don't kill as fast as casters.<P>In a group they are nice to have around and useful for protecting the casters but when a pet is as tough... there shouldn't be anyone who thinks a Pet is a good substitute for a tank.<P><BR>So does anyone think it would be unbalancing to increase the power of Warriors? If not then they are at the very least at the low end of balanced and given the number of warriors I have grouped with -purely because of the number around- I don't think they are that powerful. So far I have not been in a situation where I though that I REALLY needed a warrior.. though there have been ones where it would have been my first choice (but also plenty were it it wouldn't).<P><BR>So the short answer is YES. I do think that solo ability is relevant both in itself and as an indicator of what is on offer to the group. After all  if your weaknesses outweigh your strengths solo then you need your strengths to be more effective in the group than they are solo. <P><BR>(of course being an enc most of the time I only need one person who can take damage and so far even a druid can do that sufficiently  -I get debuffs too &lt;g&gt; ).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000607.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Should+soloing+be+an+indicator+of+class+balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>The problem with soloing is that solo is MUCH  more effective method to gain exp then grouping. Verant will never admit it but it is true. That is why it is relative easy to level druid or mage to 50 while it is pain in the butt for melee classes. Solo always was more effective even for Wizards who have huge downtime and risk while soloing. And another problem is items. Getting items is very boring and not anyone can camp several days only for get some piece of armor. Therefore all casters are much more preferable for such players cause they are not so dependent of equipment. So we have hard to level and boring to get items melee classes and easy to level and effective while  naked casters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000607.cgi&ReplyNum=000030&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Should+soloing+be+an+indicator+of+class+balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think Solo SHOULD BE a determinging factor for class balance.  Any CHR should be able to Attack ANY MoB of the same level and have a resonable  (i.e.  30 to 60%) chance of winning.  Therefore a group of say lvl 20'2 should be able to take on 25% more that thay could individually because of cooperation.  A goup of 4 lvl 20's should have a resonable chance (see above) of taking on 5 lvl 20 MoB's or 4 lvl 21 MoB's<P>To say that because we are not in a group we are not cooperating is utter BULL!!!<P>I have several freind who hunt in the same area as I do.  Some of our chars are of vastly diiferent lvls, and thefore cannot group effectively.  We still talk, and help each other out.  (hmmm sounds like grouping without a group  :-)  ).  we /assist each other, and If out classes were playing permits we buf sor summon items for each other.  <P>Just joining or not joing a group to me is not an indicatior of some sort of EQ anti-socialism. <P> Effective grouping = Cooperative playing.<P>That can be done effectively both in and out of a "group"<P>Just because someone is not in a "Group" does not mean they don't cooperate and assist other players.  I hope that Verant truly understand this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000607.cgi&ReplyNum=000031&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Should+soloing+be+an+indicator+of+class+balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>-On a side note to that, Can a unbuffed warrior solo and beat a HG? nope.<P>Yes. Hill Giant, Sand Giant or Seafury. Mano'a'mano with zero buffs and the giant falls first.<P>Yes, this takes better equipment then a full set of crafted and a couple ykeshas. Warriors are equipment based, so its no suprise that a level 50 warrior in level 30 equipment sucks rocks.<P>In the big picture, solo is irrelevent, regardless of your chosen play style in EQ:<P>Powergamer: Wants to get to 50 fast so that he can go kill dragons and planes. Best exp in the game (outside of twinkage) is a well balanced group, regardless of the class. Nobody solos plane mobs with 15k hp either.<P>Roleplayer: Levels? Experience?

</FONT><HR>Well, if we're going to count soloing as part of class balance, why not count ease of twinking and powerleveling as well.  Nothing's easier to twink than a warrior, (although twinking a monk is cheaper) and bards are really the only class that comes close in ease of powerleveling.  You can throw a 1st level warrior out against 10-12 level creatures from the get-go (or higher).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000607.cgi&ReplyNum=000033&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Should+soloing+be+an+indicator+of+class+balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000607-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000607.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000607&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000607&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
