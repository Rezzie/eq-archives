</FONT><HR>Lots of good ideas, some flames, althougha a majority of the anti-enchanter flames seem bitter "i hate my class" syndrome. <P>And a ton of good ideas in this post. Probably one of the best threads i have ever read here. I just hope someone with POWER over at verant takes the time to read this. Not even that many flames to skip over  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/wink.gif">.<P>Unfortunately, im having serious doubts about verant lately, and im dreading the seemingly inevitable withdrawal im going to go through when they finally do frustrate me into cancelling my account.<P>The US military may have given me the an incredible amout of patience, but even i have my limits.<P>Just wanted to summarise some impressions i have from this thread.<P>-General distaste for the pet delay changes to enchanters<BR>-Extreme outrage for the offhand manner Verant responded to Enchanter's distaste<BR>-A signifigant portion of the enchanters posting here feel this is only "the straw that broke the camel's back" regarding other issues with our class<BR>-Many, highly constructive ideas on changes we would like to see implemented for enchanters<BR>-A concern that enchanter's "unique" class abilities are being given to other classes<BR>-Concern over our effectiveness in high level event hunts, specifically plane raids (hate and sky mostly), and dragon hunts<BR>-Very few "Verant sux" flames, the majority of flames in this post being anti-enchanter in nature<BR>-A call for SOMETHING to be done, and worries whether anyone is listening. I have a feeling we would be happy with anything not detrimental to the class<P>I also must say this is the only issue i have seen that got this many of our "normally quiet" class up in arms, Maybe Verant should take that as a sign. I however am not sure a walk out is necessarily an answer that verant will notice. As a guildmate put it to me today "The only people hurt by the walkout are your friends." Our abilities (the ones that work) are a vital part of many many groups in Norrath, and our absence, while generating attention, will more likely draw more hostility from our fellow players than sympathy. And we REALLY need the support of our friends/guildmates/groupmates if we're going to be heard. I don't think whining about it in-game will gain us any ground either, as most people (i would assume) just want to play the game and relax, myself included. IMHO the best thing we can do is continue constructive (well, mostly) posts such as this one, and do our best to ensure that Verants decision-makers see at least some of this. A 300 some-odd thread from a normally quiet group should get their attention, so long as the majority of the posts herin remain constructive.<P>I just sometimes wish Baelish had some sort of flame filter.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/wink.gif"><P>Here's hoping for the best!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000301&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>This whole enchater pet nerf thing doesn't bother me at all... I never use my pet enough to really get worried that it's weaker than it was 2 weeks ago.... what annoys me, is that necro's got 8 new spells, and us enchantresses ( and you guys as well ) hav had 5 spells that were supposed to go live MONTHS ago, and only 1 ever did... I am refering to the "xxxx mana" line... We have "Thicken Mana" working... usefull to make a single item that is usable by a single class, and it's not a very good item at that... certainly the electrum jewelery we get to enchant at 12th level is far more versatile, and has better bonuses that those silly Wu's gauntlets.<P>The second spell is in the game, WOW, we can make a vial of Crystalized mana... BUT IT IS USELESS.. when is that spell gonna be fixed so we can do something with it? And lets not forget the other 3 spells, we know their names, but they have never been put online...<P>And yet... nerf those poor necro's, and they get 8 new spells! <P>I enjoy making things, and am a crastsmaster ( mistress ) in more than half the trade skills that make stuff, and I have to say it's been along time waiting to make new stuff..<P>my 2cp<BR>Parvathe Mourninglory<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>35th Enchantress<P>------------------<BR>Enchanted, I'm sure....<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000304&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>To high lvl ench!<P>Just want to said again that don't be too selfcentered as in saying that the nerfs didn't affect you because you are high enough lvl that pet is not a necessity.  Most who said these thing are ench who have got pass lvl 30th.  Just because something doesn't affect you too much or at all should not prevent you from seeing how it would affect other.  I have said it before and will said it again.  I am lvl 40th+ so the nerfs barely affected me if at all cause my animation are no longer needed in what I do.  However, that does not prevent myself from seeing the affect it has on the lower lvl enchanter and will not hesistate to speak out to what I think was an arrogant and ignorant part from Abashi and the people at Verant.  Abashi had stated that they, the people at Verant, are now happy with the way pets measure up to each other, and the classes behind them.  Notice he said "they" and not what the actual people who play the game who are happy.  Wasn't this suppose to be about what the fan/customer want and think?  Why would the players care if Abashi and the people at Verant think that every class is balance?  If Abashi is a wise man he would realize it should be from the players that he should be listening to and not what the programer/designer said.  Afterall, who play the game and know about the game and who just simply write codes? <P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000305&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Im not really sure what you all are complaining about. I played my enchanter from levels 1 to 50 and Ive even spent the last few days looking at the effect of the nerf on my pet.<P>A FS dagger has a delay of 19, with the haste from Swift Like The Wind (approx 40-50% from what I have heard) the delay would have been 9-10ish post patch.<P>Today I used a dagger and from what I remember, pets usually swing at a 30 delay if they are not using FS and speeded delay weapons. Now if this is true then with Swift like the Wind the delay becomes approximately 15. That is a difference of FIVE between us before patch and after patch. <P>Granted not all of us have Swift Like the Wind, but what you'll realize is that with these mega speed buffs, the difference betwee n the delays which we have 'suffered' is more and more negligible the higher the level we get. <P>My pet Garn today, wielding his two FS daggers soloed a cyclops without losing more than 5% of his HP. I am pretty sure with debuffs on a Hill giant there would be no trouble in the pet winning.<P>There is no reason to throw a fit over the nerf. It is a nerf, but it is so minute in effect to our class that they would literally only have to put in 10 extra damage in our DD spell to balance this out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000306&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Fayvren, if the affect was so minor why did Necromancers receive 2 new spell lines and continuations on 2 others?  Because the nerf somehow hit their pets harder than it did enchanters?

</FONT><HR>Do you guys REALLY think a walk-out is going to do much of anything? The only thing you will achive by not playing for a week is less server crowding for said week. If you want to be heard, don't pitch a fit. Instead, make some attempt to be reasonable in your suggestions/concerns. We all get "nerfed"... period.

</FONT><HR>I Have a 45 enchanter on fennin ro that will be joining the walkout also. I have informed my friends that i will be playing a cleric. Necros, clerics, wizards and warriors, friends all who say they support and stand behind my decision. They have seen my continuing discouragement with my class as of late. I remember the server coming down in the middle of a dragon run and when it came back up the duration of clarity was shortened =( everyone gets buffed and then we enchanters must start rebuffing all of our wonderful overpowered buffs agian because they are gone &lt;poof&gt; so fast.<BR>And then fighting the dragon. My duties were to buff, tashania, manasieve. Because my dd doesnt hit a dragon and no way can i mess/charm her. And of course mages and shaman have thier own versions of tashania. And since magic isnt really the killer &lt;well on the 8 that i have participated in&gt; What good is my tashania anyway.. Wizards got way to much resist there..=( And manasieve is so affective agianst lady vox's complete heal no?.  The 2 enchanters were put into a group with a paladin that was playing the enchanter char &lt;2 accounts&gt; So no healer (  We didnt do anything important so why did they need to keep us alive?  I really felt sorry for the wizards thou =( they were relegated to /consent wizard so they can run get your body to res you.<BR>Lets not leave out that once said dragon was killed the amount of loot that an enchanter can get off one is equal to how useful he/she is killing the dragon.<BR>*sighs*<BR>Sure i can buff my pet up. *nods* but the buff lasts all of 2 minutes max before i gotta spend another whole bubble of mana to recast it. and it takes what 6 seconds to cast? (the buff not the pet.)<BR>Some simple facts:<BR>1) ok yes the expansion is coming out soon but its not out yet. Why are you putting mobs in that are suited to abilities / spells that i dont have yet?  Why are you raising mr for creatures agian? In preperation of the expansion.. Do i get spells etc in preparation?..<BR>2) You needed to fix mages so you once agian caused my class and the necros class discouragement because of it. Im happy mages got something =/ they needed it. but did you have to make my hard road harder? Was it a must?  Take my pet out all together if you dont want me to be a pet class. This joke of a pet is almost an insult.<BR>3) Abashi's... comments. In the beginning of this thread it was Baelish asking how we feel about abashi's comments. <BR>How do i feel Baelish? Im insulted, i dont feel valued as a customer, and im ready to take my buisness elsewhere. <BR>Warriors yes you need fixes<BR>Rogues YES you need fixes BAD<BR>Wizards YES you need fixes bad.. you need some balancing. <BR>Enchanters.. *frowns and shakes her head* all im asking is not to be phased out of existance, a couple of options.<BR>While talking to a necro friend i was expressing my frustration and he said "enchanters are soooo important" <BR>I said "*nods* i keep hearing this but why" "what defines us" <BR>He said " CHARM IS AWESOME"  Yes it is awesome. <BR>The first time i used charm though...i unknowingly sat down to med and next thing i knew i had 15 mobs on me.<BR>The first real interesting thing that happend with charm was in high keep, I charmed a picklaw guard and sent it on another one which proceeded to run up the stairs, i followed casting away then shortly thereafter went back down, followed by every npc in the place that smashed me flat, <BR>Talk about a shock, granted now i know that its because your pet is an association with you and picklaw guards are bad but then i didnt, so understandably i have a tiny fear of charming.  Especially when i have to work for 3 days to get the exp i loose from one death in lvl 45.  *sighs gustily*<BR>Abashi has totally ... given me a bad impression of verants customer relations and their feelings toward their customers.<BR>Yes i will participate in the walkout.  More than anything else i want a public apology i think.  Or at least a " i didnt mean it quite that way"  <BR>forgive the spaciness of this post,  Im sleepy and i have ready every single post on my way here, agian,  I care about my class passionately,  I think this was a huge disservice, &lt;the attitude more than anything&gt;.<BR>Agian though it was the straw that broke the camels back =(.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000311&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

Then again, I suspect they think I'm a nut too...<P>Verants original vision of the enchanter was to be a merchant class.  They hoped right from the start that few people would take the enchanter over the more combat oriented classes because too many enchanters would hurt the economy.  At first there were very few of us, but now I think we are more than Verant wanted.  This is why they are holding back on the enchanted items.  Judging from recent events, I think Verant WANTS us to quit our enchanters so we dont get another fiasco (like the stein of moggok) when they do finally add the enchanted items. <P>It's all part of the big picture...<P><BR>Carolinus<BR>of The Enchanted Circle<BR>(THE enchanters only guild on all servers) <A HREF="http://www.terrapinsolutions.com/enchant/" TARGET=_blank>http://www.terrapinsolutions.com/enchant/</A> <P><BR>    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000312&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Adding insult to injury :P<P>According to GZ (cf. his last message) bards are due another charm like spell for creatures over 37. <P>To sum up :<P>- Below 20 it was pretty hard for enchant to find a group (beside your guild). But the so-called pet nerf doesnt bite much more at that level, it look like it was the same for all of us. <P>- Over 29 pets were able to get a dagger (nowhistanding the fact they were way below hp/AC levels of the pet classes, which is -normal and as it should be - . We are no pet class and never will be). So by then enchants were supposed to group. Fine. On us fall the tedious task of teaching soloers (who leveled alone so far ) how to fight as a group and looks like busy body as a result  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">.<P>- At planar level. I heard nothing good so far, beside being a clarity-cow, about our role.<BR> <BR>So we are supposed to shine inbetween those two extreme, no ?. Yes?.<P>Im not sniveling for new spells/toys or whatever, but would like a thought-over reply from verant as to what kind of role we are supposed to fill, so we can decide if the class is worth a shot after all. As far as I remember early in the game, enchants we supposed to be hard to play but special something an experienced player would love to get in a group. It look less and less so. <BR>If anyone can prove othewise or just cheer me up, I would appreciate.<P>I made 32 (first char, no twinky, every cp hard gained), and thought that over 29 the sky would brighten a bit, now it doesnt look like it. Maybe Im getting put-off of being asked a clarity every 5 mins already. I dont picture myself being reduced to cast this only spell from this day hence (please no need to point out the various things enchants can do, I know them and did them  as well as you do).<P>A tired enchanter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000313&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>  I also think it is a crock of bull with this latest bug that Verant created and now they are "OK with it"<P> I have to admit, properly buffed before the enchanter pet was major damage creator, coming real close if not more than the other pets..but thats only with our class specialty buffs.  Buffs that take time and mana.  Now this is the top enchanter pet, which is not as easy to cast as the mage or necro.  One major difference is our pets need constant attention.  They have very little hp and die very fast.  I have watched mages and necros set their pets lose in a dungeon and let them kill everthing in site.  Hell, cast a Burnout and damage shield on a mage earth elemental and evertything that attacks it practally kills itself.  This can no way be done with a enchanter pet.  The enchanter must keep his pet alive by stunning mobs, or using runes to protect them.  And now we get compared to SKs and Shaman as in having pets.  Im sorry but SK,s and Shaman are true pet secondarys, they get pets later on and do not need them at all to fight.  Enchanter are a true pet class from level 1.  SKs and Shaman have something called armor too....not a darn robe.<BR>  In closing Im discused with this accepted bug they have created.  I agree and support the walkout of the Enchanter class.<P>Asmonius<BR>Level 50 Enchanter &lt;Test&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000314&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Enchanters are by no means the best solo class, if you have ever played a mage (and I have) they are insanly more powerful then enchatner pets, their hps alone would junk an animation in no time. Enchanter pets just cant take a hit... I think we HAVE been nerfed and much for the worse, I can and have summoned a pet when my group has started taking too much dmg and we just plain needed a throw away tank that can dole out enough dmg to be useful... This nerf has just cut our dmg potential by 1/3 as well as necro pets, however they got compensation and we did not, I dont like the fact that necros seem to be getting all this attention to their classes (New summon corpse spell) while we sit idly by and get nothing, no WORSE we are an afterthougt (oh gee, that will effect enchanters pets too?  oh well) <P>PO'ed</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000316&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>While I am fairly okay with the pet nerf, I am not even slightly okay with the attitude Verant has taken with our concerns.<P>I actually would think it would make more sense to make our pet (as suggested elsewhere) a major taunting tool.<P>After all, we are "Masters of Illusion" (Illusion is a joke, but nevermind.) and "Master of Crowd Control" (Wait isn't that Bards and Druids?)<P>So either a) Make our Pet able to taunt better and get mobs off us - even if it dies in the process<BR>or b) Give us a spell that allows us to buff our pet (level 8 would be nice) or any player - level (16/24 for this spell) to act as a mob magnet in group combat.<BR>You could call the first, Tashani's Sphere of Enragement. The logic behind is that the spell makes the pet so offensive to mobs that they HAVE to attack it) The second you could call Tashani's Tumultuous Taunt. This also makes every attack the effected character makes a personal affront to the attacked creature.<P>On PvP servers, this might also work as an offensive spell, on Non PvP servers, you could leave the spell as is an thereby make Enchanters a bad class to annoy. Or make it only castable (?) on people in your group.<P>After all, we are supposed to be the class that can inflame, lull and coerce the mobs in the game. Shouldn't we also be able to direct that rage off us?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000317&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

I <BR>don't mind the DD taunt because this is not<BR>what we are about.  But many of us DD because the debuffs are a joke.  Some<BR>stats like dex and agi getting a debuff <BR>seem sorta useless.  <P>Our pets should be given the fastest speed of all pets.  Then let us speed them up even more with our spells if we have extra mana (which we never do).  <P>Buff spells should all have save to magic, poison, fire, ect all added to them to make them unique and desirable.  <P>Well just a few ideas.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000319&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have read some of the post but i don't think there is much hope for them helping are pets they have been nerfed so that is it.<BR>How about doing something to charm line of spells like give them a constant durantion instead of random. Such as Charm give you 5 min. enthral gives you 7 min of the pet instead of being random if i had that I wouldn't need a pet (For the most part) at least you would be effective in a group(as far as a pet). I know that enchanters are not suppose to be the master of damage and are not suppose to have the greatess of pets but come on. You guys at verant nerf something and it effects the enchanters and you say oh well uhh yea we knew that was happening and we ok with it. WELL we are not happy with it.

</FONT><HR>You all have done a great job of mentioning why and Enchanter is not really an Enchanter.<P>NOTE: Read Sony's class descriptions lately.  We are nothing like that.  If those descriptions are the original intent of the game, then Enchanters might as well be taken out of the game because we can't do any of it.<P>The big boys at Verant talk so much about original intent and class balance.  Well at least give us your definition of what an enchanter should do.  Based on pratical playing, we can't do much except parlor tricks and dying.<P>I finally hit 20. Now I don't know if it is worth it to get to 50 or start something new.  I picked an Enchanter based on what Sony's description was.

</FONT><HR>Well ...<P>Seems like everyone is getting all there issues with our class off there chests .. GOOD.<P>This post is aimed at my lvl 40 plus bretheren.<P>Forget the lame pets .. its not worth making an issue over .. if you want to make a stand, make it on the 2 biggest problems facing a high lvl ench in a high risk situation. The 2 are..<P>1. MEM BLUR <P>Cast entrance and mem blur on a spectre 4 levels below you .. it wont blur (most of the time) What happened to the mem blur side effect of the mess line? okaaaay so i take up a valuable slot for AE mind wipe .. i get the "blinks a few times" msg .. doesnt take. This happenes on blues all the way to reds .. if it doesnt work SAY it failed, how can we be confident in our abilities if we have to "hope" that our mem blur works .. as you know, all our spells either work, or are resisted. FIX THIS<P>Either make mem blur unresistable as in 100% chance of working ( its such a subtle spell, it should never fail) <BR>OR<BR>Give us a "resisted" warning so we can get on with the job of protecting our group without stressing over the uncertain..<P>2. CHARM<P>Give us a respectible minimum duration ( 30 secs) + "x" where "x" is our level divided by 2; in seconds. Subtracted from this is "y" where "y" is the difference in lvls between us and the MOB ( say -5 sec for each lvl higher than low blue ) relative to our lvl.<P>E.G. Lvl 40 ench charms a lvl 35 MOB (assuming low blue is lvl 32)<P>30 + 20 - 15 = 35 sec MINIMUM .. add the imfamous random duration on TOP of this...<P>THIS should be our pets .. not those stupid animations that they will never fix </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000322&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

I want a better damage spell instead of those goofy sight spells or better dots like necros. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000324&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 20 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;13&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-17.html">17</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-18.html">18</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-19.html">19</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-20.html">20</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000223&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000223&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
