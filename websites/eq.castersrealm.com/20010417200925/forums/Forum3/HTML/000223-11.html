</FONT><HR>Hey imbecile!  What do enchanters charm from 1-11?  Oh dont have the spell yet.  <P>Idiot!  Suppose I do get the HG charmed, now what?  Wear him out on fire beetles till charm breaks?<P>Stupid! This SG is too high to charm, what about him?<P>If I make my living playing this class, I am pretty D-A-M-N-E-D sure I know more about what works and what doesn't than you.  We are not asking for a necro nerf, so go back to what you were doing.  It isn't even JUST this nerf.  You think you're the only class to get nerfed EVERY patch lately, think again.  At least they tell you when they nerf you most of the time.<P>Sorry for the flame, but if it is going to be players versus verant, we need to stick together and trolls like this are what give Abashi the ammo to nerf all classes.  If you do not care for the 'balancing' of your pet (and I wouldn't if I were a 29-43 necro for sure), then do what you can to help necros, not step on enchanters.<P><BR>Leirra </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000250&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I AM an enchanter, my only character.<BR>although i believe some responce is in order a walkout would once again punish me for eq's mistake.i enjoy that there are so few enchants and may i suggest instead that for a week that the only grouping to be done with an enchant should be with another enchant?together we are a force and maybe some of those inappreciative snots will realize that they do after all need an enchant?tired of being a tag along ? a mule for taunt at the least and alliance at best?or just coming along to help someone else achieve their quest?and don't forget the: "oh hey, how much to enchant this metal for me"? "no no i can make it myself just cast the spell ok"?<BR>is'nt it bad enough that every armor i get off a npc is for some other class not to mention the vendors selection.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000251&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>  As a necromancer, I feel your pain.  As a fellow player I truly sympathize.  There are<BR>simply not enough enchanters as it is, and I wish people would start more of them (heck,<BR>it was my first choice in beta until they took away the 'fly' spell).  I think that the enchanter week-long walk-out is a good idea,<BR>but I am concerned that it will still not make a difference for you.  There has to be a lot of enchanters to make your lack of presence felt.<P>  Nevertheless, I would certainly vote to have the enchanter pet delay nerf removed,<BR>even if it meant that Necromancers were still nerfed.<P><BR>Olibri<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000254&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well, after reading this, I've decided... you people whine too much.  Half the classes of Norrath don't have pets... you do.  Shut up and get over it.  They designed this game for balance.  How many other classes can create permentant stat buffs, and sell them to other players.... Hello, jewellers... You aren't a combat class.  Yes, everyone needs to make exp, and therefor, you have a pet for a few extra hits.  Your pet, and a magician/necro pet are two different classes of pet.  Thiers are personal tanks.  Yours is a DoT that is really mana efficient.  Instead of whining because someone else got a buff that you didn't, try taking a look at why Verant thinks that you are already balanced.  Stop looking for thier mistakes, and take a look at your own underestimations of yourselves.  Whining solves nothing, and just makes other people mad.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000256&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Now that I think about it, I went through all that trouble of getting that patch; Download server not working after trying 15-20 times a day every day for 8 days, then asking a friend to e-mail the patch to me, then finding out that my e-mail service wouldn't receive the file, then switching e-mail services and trying again, then finally getting the patch done. <I>FOR WHAT???</I> For another enchanter nerf. It's like I forged a path of my own demise. How depressing. Henceforth, until due compensation is given, I will post 5 messages on this thread every day to further the cause. Verant cannot say no to a 500 post long thread. I've been involved in MANY message board threads accross many online games, and so far, I haven't ever seen a thread exceed 400 posts. (Actually, there might be a few on the EQ boards or this board that I have overlooked, but I'd say 400 is one heck of a message thread!) <BR>Likewise, I've never seen posts pop up at a rate like this! In the time it took me to eat a snack, more than 15 new posts appeared. In the time it took me to write one message to add to this thread, 3 other posts appeared. At the rate this one is gaining popularity, I wouldn't be suprised to see it go over 500. Hey, only about 250 more to go. I'd give it, oh...3 more days and we're taking off. Come to think of it, that still might not get their attention. Go ahead with the server protests too!

</FONT><HR>I have to agree that pets have never been a big part of the Enchanter class. With the inability to control them at all, I've relied much more on my ability to crowd control... <P>However, in figuring out crowd control finally to a pretty good level, I've found that I can't control high level mobs very well, with continual resists against my spells. Now this poses a BIG problem if I ever want to go to the planes. I definitly see Enchanters as a very well balanced class up to the very high levels. We definitly need some added effectiveness in the higher levels. Illusion: Werewolf is nice, but are we supposed to be tanks at lvl 44?? <P>Hopefully we'll have some upgrades when the expansion comes out, but until then, and we start going to the planes on Lanys, the pet nerf isn't bothering me too much.<P>Chris<BR>(sorry for the Anonymous post)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000260&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Whine. Whine. Whine.<P>STFU.<P>Adding pets to the enchanter class was all around the absolute worst thing Verant has done. Delete the entire spell line, or at least anything after 12th, and be done with it. As it stands right now, today, I can buff my own animation to a point where it rips<BR>apart any necro pet, and any magician pet without damage shields. They are too powerful -now-, and whining about them being<BR>"nerfed" is just sickening.<P>There was a time when Enchanters had no animation, it was one of the last things added in P3. They all leveled anyways.<BR>Animations were intended to assist the enchanter at lower levels, before they had aquired the wide bredth of the entire spell<BR>                   line.<P>Play some other classes and you'll learn to appreciate what balance really is. Try playing a wizard with -no- pet at all and no<BR>resistance lowering debuff either. Try playing a warrior with no spells, wondering exactly how you can get your body without<BR>invis. There is an intricate dance of interclass balance, and it most certainly does not involve one spell versus another.<P>Have fun "being gone", I'll be online all the same.<P><P>------------------<BR>--<BR>Senir, Erudite Arch Wizard<BR>Bartab, Ogre Weaponmaster<BR>Iden, Erudite Mindmaster<BR>Fires of Heaven, Veeshan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000261&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Outside of the pet and other nerfs, I think that Verant definitely needs to GET US OUR ENCHANT SPELLS.<P>If we were the only way to enchant metal (Giant Fire Beetle Eye-GRRRR), and/or we were the only class that could make jewelry &gt;=)...<P>If we could enchant wood (magic arrows and bows...)<P>Or if our debuffs worked, or better yet, when they DO work (not resisted) they stay until the MoB is dead =).  We are supposed to ENCHANT (permanently) stuff, right?<P>Or our charm spell could be renewed, warning when it's gonna go...<P>If we could debuff charmed pets would be nice, so that we don't die every time we charm and it breaks.<P>Minimum charm time sounds awfully nice as well.<P>Or charm lasts until the pet kills a MoB or two.  Now that has some possibilities. (Oh no, I just killed my best friend, YOUR CHARM SPELL BREAKS).  Would make more sense =)<P>On a minor note, I just got to 12, and tried charm in BB.  It works great, fine and dandy. Works on Elite Guards, alright. But you can't take the pet ANYWHERE. Camping the elite ledge doesn't work because the guard can't walk off the ledge and onto a bridge to follow the thing it's supposed to be attacking.<P>And what might really be nice would be if /pet get lost worked on charmed pets &gt;=). OMG, we might be able to SOLO something. Even if we didn't get xp or faction or loot, that would be great, because we might be able to kill one thing that's about to kill us.<P>Ok, that may be an ultra death-ish spell &gt;=), but would make up for all our nerfs, or perhaps made any charm-line spell take 4000 seconds to regenerate, like the lay on hands or harm touch.<P>Charm would be more useful even if get lost just made them break charm.  My groups hate having to wait for charm to break just so they can kill the MoB. And I don't want to bother casting invisibility.<P>Or we had a charm at lvl 1, but wouldn't work on anything higher than our level.<P>If charm worked ONCE per zone but stayed on until the pet dies...<P>or again, takes long time to regenerate, like lay on hands or harm touch.<P>Charm could be our special ability for the class =) No one else gets it, and we save it for special occasions (i.e. we don't charm the first gnoll pup we see, cuz that commander we're camping may be coming up in an hour or two).<P>I think if we just plain lost our pets, but had the ability to charm every 4000 seconds from lvl 1, we would have something going &gt;=)<BR>No mana cost for charm, we get no other kind of pet, and a charm that works, though probably not on anything higher than yellow.<P>Sorry for the long post, but I really think that Charm ability, STAYS till the pet dies, would be a great way to make us able to solo a bit, and make us better for grouping.<P>Admittedly, perhaps a little overpowered, but perhaps some compromises could be made.<P>I REALLY would like to hear from others about this subject, and let Verant hear your voices, because we only have each other (and a few local other casters) on our side.<P>e-mail me at knutty@whyweb.com if you have anything to say or would like to help me organize this (and most of the other) post(s).<P>I think Verant will listen to reason if they <BR>1) Don't have to sort through 20000 petitions and requests, so some organized effort should be made to categorize and summarize these various comments and complaints/concerns/suggestions.<BR>2) Know that we are willing to compromise (pray that they are =P)<BR>3) Actually get the information we are sending out. Verant and it's employees are under no legal obligation to look at any of this, and it's our job to make sure they see it.<BR>4) Unfortunatly, nobody is going to see any of this unless we get organized and speak reasonably. NOBODY wants to sort through the petitions, postings, and complaints of 50,000 users, and they shouldn't have to. Which is why I am proposing we work together and get organized in some fashion to actually succeed in a petition.<P>Just think, maybe Verant and Co will listen to the Quiet Class...

</FONT><HR>I have not posted here before but feel compelled to do so.  To be brief, this most recent nerf has all but killed any chances of someone creating a new enchanter with any kind of success.  At low levels, enchanters NEED a decent pet to even attempt to survive.  This is because at low levels (through the early teens) we are nearly worthless in the eyes of most groups.  Our real class defining skills do not exist until around 29 when we get clarity, and then the wonderful world of grouping becomes easy.  The other thing that kills me is that Verant continues to refer to our animations as "pets" when they are at best a variable DoT.  If they really want to fix things, get rid of the pet status on the animation, allowing us to charm while we have a pet up.  At least then when charm breaks there is some way to get the MOB off of your scrawny butt.  The other alternative would be to make our animations true pets that we could command, like EVERY other class that has them, at least then we might be able to save them from themselves with some more regularity.  Well, just my 2cp...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000264&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>In response to Whatever (here's a truncated quote):<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>Well, after reading this, I've decided... you people whine too much. Half the classes of Norrath don't have pets... you do. Shut up and get over it. They designed this game for balance. [etc..]<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>After carefully considering your post, I have come to the conclusion that your arguments mean **** on the basis that you haven't actually played an enchanter (or please correct me if I'm wrong, and I'll eat my words.) Simply stated, the classes are unbalanced. Enchanters certainly no longer have the capabilities they used to have. If enchanters are a non-combat class, we would gladly take item enchantment, better buffs, and better debuffs. Unfortunately, Verant has enstated the class as a "grouping class," and other players have branded us "crowd-controllers." With these elements slowly usurped by other characters' new abilities, screaming terror for example, and silent nerfs such as magical skin reduction on berserker strength/spirit, enchanters are becoming less and less viable. Again, this thread is not just about our pets; it addresses the enchanters' growing problems as a whole. Sorry about the flames, but I'm fighting for a cause I really believe in (if that's any real justification for you.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000267&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>For all of you folks saying "YOU WERENT MEANT TO SOLO"  I've got news for you.  Try to get a group at level 20.  NO ONE wants you.  Travel from continent to continent to go to a zone just to find that even though you spend all day looking for a group - you cant get one.  Because at this level most folks dont understand how to work with you.  They know you deal out crappy damage and arent very sure just exactly what the crap it is you do.  THIS is why we solo.  Unless you have RL friends that play with you, chances are you will be FORCED to solo until you become the crack dealer.  I dont have a hard time getting a group now.  But I remember relying on my crappy pet to get me to this point.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000270&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>To those that contend that all Enchanters should expect from their class is to be pure group support....<P>Look if all enchanters could ever do from day one was mezz, stun, charm, clarity, and cast minor buffs and debuffs and people were told this up front. Then you are correct in saying no one should complain or be surprised.<P>But this is not the case.  I chose the Enchanters because I could chose to either play in a pure group support mode OR with cunning, guile and talent could play is a solo role as well.  <P>In short the Enchanter when I started the class was a very versitile class.  It had a broad range of skills and capability and people BRIGHT enough to recognize this have had a lot of fun exploring the various ways to use our limited damage dealing capabiliies to the fullest.  Now after nearly 7 months (for me) and for some a year or more into playing the enchanter class varent is systematically redefining us to be purely group support.  Those of us that have chosen to explore the full range of our classes capabilities and have seen more potential then simply passing gas (clarity) and mezzing and stunning PC's for OTHERs to have the fun of killing the MOB's have a right to be upset when now after in some cases a year of playing enchanters we are being told that we are to be FORCED into the mind numbingly boring role of passing gas (clarity) for hours on end so that others might enjoy the satisfaction of actually killing the creatures in the game.  <P>Many have used the argument that they are being forced to group so why should Enchanters feel they have a right to complain?  My issue has to with the role in the group that we are forced to play.  There is a difference to be forced into a group and be able to actually deal damage and be forced into a group simply to hold things down while others damage them.  In a group role this is really Enchanters get to do and yes I understood that going into the class.  But I also knew when this became frustrating or boring I could leave for a while and solo things until I had a chance to decompress, or if I needed to camp an Enhanter only item I could do it on my own without having to convince someone to spend THEIR play time help get something for ME.  Now I and other enchanters who for a nearly a year have defined ourselfs as more then just gas passers are being told that we are going to be FORCED to simply pass gas and we get NO say in the matter.<P>Imagine if druids were told all their damage spells were being taken away because varent and other whiners felt that they should not be able to solo and they were being redefined to simply cast snare while others killed the things they were snaring.  How many people do you know would rush to create Druids?<P>My second gripe is that varent nerfs other classes then somehow feels obligated to compensate them yet they freeing wank the Encahnter class and don't even bother mentioning they have done it 99% of the time!<P>Just a short list of spells that were changed or never had any real use for Enchanters yet we are told we will get NOTHING to replace these albatross's in our spell books:<P>(1) whirl til you hurl line(3 spell) - Reduced with absolutely NO apology from varent to nothing more then a 2 second stun that costs 5 times as much as any other casters root.  There have been some that claim they still use this spell.  Well I have tried it and there are much more efficient ways to use mana then cast these peices of trash!  Crap I can cast flux, sit count to 3, stand cast shift, sit count to 5, stand cast flux and repeat and effectively use VERY little mana and keep something stunned nearly indefinately.  Why would I chose to use whirl and run out of mana after 5 casts!<P>(2) charm line of spells (3 spells) - Resists are so high and duration so unpredictably short that the entire charm line of spells is now a suicide spell to cast on anything blue or above.  NOTE: this line of spells is rendered useless in the planes as even with tashania you cannot cast these unresisted on anything and even if you could the duration would be so short that there would be no practical use.<P>(3) The amount that tashania reduces MR has seemed to have been reduced according to what is posted on eq.castersrealm.com from -65 to -31.<P>(4) The entire line of sight based spells (5 spells!) - (I see through your eyes) has little to no use.<P>(5) Strength debuff (something like 8 spells) - The entire line of strenght debuff spells has little to no effect on most MOB's.  ie before casting and burning a significant amont of my mana the MOB hits on average for 98 points of damage per attack and after casting the MOB hits for an average of 96.  So what?  It takes one more hit to kill me.  I have cast all the strength lower spells I have that stack against a single mob and the effect on the damage they deal is insignificant. <P>(6) Lull series - (4 spells) resistence set so high that these spells are suicide against any thing you cast them on.  I use this spell if I want to ensure that I pull the maximum number of mobs from a site and I WANT them all to agro me.  Which I have on a few occassions found useful.  Somehow I cant believe that was the desing intent?!?<P>(7) Mezz and Stun series (3 Stun, 3 mezz) - ALL USELESS in the planes!  All become very highly resisted at level 44.  I have cast 5 unsuccessful stuns in a row against blue mobs and I am level 44 and have a charisma of 203.<P>(8) Damage shield of rampage silently reduced by 20% several patches ago.<P>(9) Illusions (15+ spells) - Faction effect of illusions stripped with no explanation and no apology by varent.  Redering this entire line of spells as purely a novelty.  Most of the effects are redundant and can be achieved with other spells (with perhaps the exception of regenerate that comes from the Troll illusion).<P>(10) Curse of the simple mind and Mana Sieve effectively useless against MOBs.<P>(11) The animation according to abashi is for defence and emergency.  Then why have it take so long to cast?  Then why allow it to attack at all?  Then why give it NO taunt ability?  Then why give it fewer HP's then the caster?  Why is anim AI so lame? (ie MOB 1 hitting for 98, MOB 2 40 levels below comes and TRYs to hit for 1, anim stops attacking MOB 1 and chases after MOB 2 while MOB 1 procedes to convert the master that the anim was suppose to protect into a pile of paste!) I can easily list another 10 why's.  This spell is broken! To dismiss it with the line of crap we have been fed is an insult and Enchanters have a very legitimate excuse to be very upset.<P>I am sure there are more and purhaps if time permits and I decide to really take the time to make a case of this I may collect it organize it and submit it to varent which they I am sure will promptly file in a trash can because after all <P>       "we are in their world now!"<P><BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000272&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Alright, wanna see my point of view?  I dont know if this has been said/suggested before, but here goes how I feel without having read all 11 pages of the responses.. I feel that due to the lack of power our animations have, we should be compensated in a different way then the rest of the classes.  Now, they all get them from fighting right? Everyone has something about them they have.. Warriors are best melee which is half the game.. Wizards are best casters which is other half of the game.  Everyone else falls somewhere between there. Druids can fight some and cast some but all their spells are based on nature, bards have songs, you get my point.. but Enchanters, where do they fall? Verant tried to make a lame Merchant character, yet they try and make them able to fight with the other classes. The way I feel is that Enchanters should gain experiance from gaining skills.. Because they are at a great disadvantage from everyone else and its very difficult to fight when just about any other class can decide they are gonna fight and go do it. Enchanter has to have numerous elements in their favor in order to go hunt.  So enchanters should get experiance based on what they do best, jewlcraft and work with items.  Then they should have a raised skill cap per level, or make it so by the time they get a certin amount of skill, they get a level.  And also weigh the skills.  That way someone couldnt go and get like 1-10 in all skills and level. But you know what im saying?  Ive spent some long weekends in towns, not battlefields, making jewlery and such for others. The only thing I got out of it was PP, not EXP. No other class has a reason to be in town other then banking, spells and other reasons.. I mean they cant go in a town and virtually set up a shop and sell things all day.  Verant needs to make a new slate on exp for Enchanters so they do get exp for making all those rings and necklaces and also possibly exp for promoting in skills.  Fighting is nice for a change but if I could get the same amount of exp from being a Enchanter then trying to be a Magician or other class by trying to fight, I would be a lot happier. I also will be taking part in the Enchanter boycott and will consider rerolling if need be and our demands arent met by Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000274&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 20 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-17.html">17</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-18.html">18</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-19.html">19</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000223-20.html">20</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000223&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000223&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
