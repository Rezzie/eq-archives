</FONT><HR>Well, I lack the perspective of a higher level enchanter, as I have only reached level 16, but I have seen some requests in this thread for the opinions of lower-level enchanters, so here is mine:<P>This nerf doesn't affect me at all.<P>Personally, I gave a dagger to my pet maybe 5 times from level 1 to 16. Most of the time it was killed instantly by something. From that, the trouble of buying them in town, etc. I just stopped doing it. I ALWAYS get rid of my animation if I am in a group, so that I can have Charm available if I need it. I do not use Charmed monsters as normal pets, I simply use Charm as a stopgap method to remove one monster from the attacking group and use it to dish some damage out to its companions. As for my personal opinions on the matter, I think that animations should be weak, barely strong enough for us to solo with. These are not elemental forces from another dimension, or even foul undead. It's a silly little shield and a weapon. I was suprised it worked as well as it did. As for enchanters not dealing out much damage, and having one of their major sources of damage taken away, again, I feel this is not a concern. As an Enchanter, I feel my role is not doing damage but preventing it. Nearly all our spells revolve around preventing damage, by weakening or slowing a monster, stunning it, or removing it from the fight entirely. If there is any other damage caster in the party, I drop Sanity Warp so I can memorize another debuff. And I have yet to see why Whirl TYH is such a bad spell. This is probably my second-most used spell. About 1/3 of the time it takes the monster out of action for the rest of the fight. I have NEVER had it last less than twice the duration of the AE stun, unless someone in the group is silly and bashes it or stuns it. And it costs 5 more mana than Languid Pace. Languid is a nice spell, but in terms of sheer numbers of attacks, it would have to be a much longer combat than mine typically are to effectivly remove as many attacks as Whirl does. I have actually been in several groups with a second enchanter, and from my experience they tend to rely on their damage spells. I see lots of Choke, lots of Chaotic Feedback. I have been with enchanters who didn't have their AE stun or Mesmerize memorized, and who have never cast a single debuff while I grouped with them. Now granted, they may not have needed to after they realized I was more than happy to take over this role. In any case, the point of all this was to say that in my fairly low-level opinion, Enchanters are by FAR the best at damage prevention, with so many different ways to stop it. Shamans are second-best, but they don't get as many options as we do. Nobody else even touches it. I really enjoy doing this, and that is why I play an enchanter. I don't want to sell enchanted weapons or items and make a ton of money. I don't want to run around with a mega-pet and solo yellows. I want to keep my group from getting hurt and ease the burden on the healers in the group.<P>Althien of E. Marr<P>Oh, one minor thing I forgot to mention. Would you like it if they allowed the speed increase of a weapon but decreased the damage accordingly? For example a pet with a dagger might hit fast but for 50% damage, while a pet with a two-handed sword might deal 150% damage, but hit VERY slowly. This is probably FAR too much trouble to insert into the code, and thus would never happen, but would allow pet users to customize their pets MUCH more. What do you think?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>One of the things i have always loved about my enchanter is the flexibility of playing my class.  To those that believe we are ONLY crowd control you are not only wrong but ignorant.  In certain situations( a group outside) crowd control isn't all we do...add in buffs like alicrity and debuffs like languid pace...In a group in a dungeon sure crowd control is key.  When fighting with only one more player in your group outside then pets surely help.  Now unfortunately not only higher level enchanters have been hurt but also the lower levels...think back to when you were anywhere from 8th to 20th levels and how tough it was to find a group.  Well now if you can't find a group you can't even think of soloing...hard enough before...but now oh well.  So now that our pets are balanced i am so glad that when i have to chain cast pets i am getting less damage for each one i cast before i die...<P>Thank you Verant yet again ya weakened my class...Why not give up on the animation and give me a decent charm...I would actually like it better it may be death but hey at least i would have a little fun before i died.<P>all I can say is someday maybe one of you will actually play an enchanter (from level 1) and then maybe we will get some attention<P>Unomee Donchoo Enchantress of solusek ro<BR>Sychotique Enchantress of tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000029&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well....screwed again.<P>From the perspective of a PvP server, this hurts all the more.  First they take charm and fear away from us.....our best attack AND more importantly DEFENSE spells.  I will admit it was being abused, but that could have been recoded rather than tossed out  (heaven forbid they take the time away from making the game soundblaster live compatible).  Now our pet, one of our prime means of defense in both normal and PvP relatively useless.  <P>As a point of comparison, I have the 29 pet spell.  A monk friend (level 20) asked if I would summon a pet for some one hand blunt practice.   Out of curiosity, I had him fight full force (read: bare handed) and he took out the pet with about half a bubble loss....and this was BEFORE the nerf.  I hate to think now.<P>In closing, it has been pointed out that enchanters dont have much of a voice because there are so few of us.   Maybe we should have a clarity / augment sickout for a few days.  THAT would get the server users attention.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000030&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Abashi's attitude about enchanters sickens me.  His arguments include only what he wants you to know, and conveniently leave out the points he doesn't want you to know.  <P>Case in point:  if enchanter pets were exempted from the weapon-speed nerf, "they'd be able to put out more damage than the necro pet can currently.  Enchanters have the ability to cast better speed buffs than either of the true pet-using classes."<P>Let's analyze how ridiculous this statement is:<P>1.  What difference does it make if enchanter pets put out a bit more damage IN A GIVEN AMOUNT OF TIME than any other pets?  Their ridiculously low amount of hps guarantees that the necro and mage pets will live 3-4 times longer, so over the long haul, the necro and mage pets VASTLY out damage enchanter pets.  Our pets NEED to do major damage during their short lifespans, so that we have some kind of chance of finishing the critter off when they die.  Funny how Abashi points out the damage comparison to other pets, and conveniently leaves out the fact that this barely makes up for the other glaring deficiencies of our pets, the net result of which is that our pets were ALREADY by far the weakest pets pre-nerf (which they should have been).  Now they're even worse.<P>2.  Abashi points out that enchanters have the best speed increasing spells in the game, and that this will replace the loss of the weapon speed reduction, as though we didn't use speed spells AND the weapon speed reduction.  HELLO, IS ANYBODY HOME IN THERE?  *shouts in Abashi's ear, waves hand in front of Abashi's glazed eyes*.  Enchanters used BOTH the speed increasing spell line, AND the dual wield speed reduction, and these two things together barely allowed our animations to survive a battle some of the time.  Often, both together STILL weren't enough, and we still had to zone or die.  Abashi's comment is like telling someone, "You don't need the socks I just took from you, you have a pair of shoes you can use instead.  Your feet will be fine in the snow", as though the person had never worn their shoes AND their socks at the SAME TIME.<P>What an idiot.  Or maybe he thinks WE are the idiots, and won't notice the glaring omissions, contradictions, and inconsistencies in his statements.  More likely, he just doesn't care.<P>Abashi likes to point out that enchanters have a greater variety of spells than any other class, and on this point, he is correct.  Too bad that half of them are completely useless due to bugs, or they literally have no use.  Some examples, you ask?<P>1.  Who has ever used a single one of the sight line of spells?  I never have, and none of the many enchanters I know ever has (and I was the leader of an enchanter only guild on MM for months, we had around 50 members).  <P>2.  What about the Whirl line of spells that are totally worthless, since anything you do in combat breaks them almost immediately (Verant claimed this was a bug and promised many months ago to fix them, but we still wait...).  <P>3.  Has any enchanter ever successfully used a spell from the lull line without pulling an entire camp on your head?  I rarely have, and I'm 39th level, I quit using them altogether after a half dozen deaths and no successes.  <P>4.  Then we have the ever popular dual lines of spells to remove enchantments.  Is it me, or does it seem like they only remove a harmful enchantment after removing EVERY GOOD ENCHANTMENT FIRST?  <P>5.  Then there's the incredible line of illusion spells that do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING USEFUL with only 3 exceptions I can think of:  Water elemental gives water breathing, fire elemental gives fire shield, and troll gives regen. The others are nearly worthless, they often give no noticeable faction increase with the race in question, and they DON'T HIDE YOUR RELIGION!!  What the hell is up with that?<P>And what's up with this incredible magic resistance that enchanters have on every spell in their books?  I grouped with a cleric 6 levels lower than myself last week to kill troll guards, and after tashani, he was having a 20-25% resist rate on his damage and stun spells, while I had a 90% resist rate on EVERY KIND OF SPELL I TRIED TO CAST!!  This included DoT, DD, Debuff, Stun, Mez, EVERYTHING!!  What the hell is up with that?  The only value I had in the group was pulling with Tashani, and then taking most of the damage after every single spell I cast aggroed the guard on me, even though 90% were resisted.  Hey, but at least I found use for the damage shield of the fire elemental illusion.  Without the cleric chain casting heals on me, I would have died in nearly every combat.  But I guess that makes sense, since I actually did a few points of damage on every third or fourth guard, unlike the two tanks who were each double hitting for 50-100 points at a time...<P>Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people who claim that every class is better than mine, and my class sucks, and is unplayable.  I have always loved the enchanter class, and found many versatile ways to play it.  I just felt the need to point out the many bugs, useless spells, outright problems, and oversights involved with the enchanter class, because when you look at the nerf to animations in this context, it becomes clear that it is MUCH more of a hit to our class than Abashi wants anyone to believe.  Personally, due to my ability to only play an hour or two at a time except very late at night (or early in the morning, depending on your point of view), I have always found it difficult to get into a good group and still have any time to do anything before I have to log off.  Without my pet, I would never have made it to level 29, I soloed about 90% of the time before 29th (as I said, this was out of necessity, not choice).<P>It's time for enchanters to stand up and demand that for once, we should get compensated for this nerf to our class!  We should also demand that Verant stop giving our unique abilities to other casting classes (lowering MR, mezzing, etc).  At the very least, let's demand that if they're going to continue bending us over a barrel, they at least better use a little Vaseline!  =P<P><BR>Landros Simulacre<BR>Disenchanted enchanter on Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000035&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>What I can't understand is every other Enchanters problem with resists...I seem to have little or no problems at all.<P>Reducing pet damage kinda sucks, but when you look at soloability, where do the poor rogues and warriors come into the picture? They can't solo ****. <P>Still, I am an Enchanter and I have to stick up for us, we have recieved nothing in return for our nerf and I can't see why not.<P>Illusions in PoH, while they made it a lot easier to get in and set up I thought that with the amazingly crap pathing and pet thing in the zone the overall balance was quite nice....probably about 3 total wipeouts in 8 hours average, pretty much guarenteeing no xps gain for most people.<P>Spell resists in PoH, there is a myth going around that Enchanters are useless in planes. I have never heard so much utter bull**** in my entire life. Plane of Fear is very tough without us, so is Plane of Hate I imagine....I have heard tales of 5 mobs being kept mesmerised at once in PoF by 2 enchanters, something quite impressive if you ask me, although every single time I went we managed to get slaughtered !<P>Hope this clears a few misconceptions, yes we do need something in return for the pet nerf, yes there are far too many haste items in game now, but thank god for that...it means I only have to buff every 30 mins instead of every 10. Clarity is such a pain in the arse, I wish I had it group version, I couldn't care less if it affected everyone and cost more mana than 6 total clarity's, I hate having to cast it so many times.<P>I like the idea of pets proccing color flux instead of damaging things, proccing mem blur however would be far more effective ! In fact that would kick ass...we could actually mez something and not have it broken when the pet attacked in retaliation...in fact, our pets should never die if this was the case  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>Lata, <P>Chernobyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000037&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Yes, enchanters are made to group, and I would love to be able to do so.  However, as long as this game remains unfriendly to the working adult, I will HAVE to solo quite often.

</FONT><HR>Personally I feel that Verant should give all of the classes that need it, more spells that are group friendly. Spells that ONLY work when grouped! Whether for the group or the caster.  Everyone is beginning to concentrate one soloing even though there were only two classes orignally that this was meant for.<BR>I dont know about the rest of you, but Im waiting for the expansion pack with mixed fellings. Do I give Verant more money (and a bigger hold on me) and hope that it addresses many of the problems of EQ, or do I just wait and see when it is my classes turn to be nerfed and then quit a la UO?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000040&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I frequently play games that are challenging, yet possible.  I play these games for hours on end.  If I saw a level for StarCraft or Warcraft or that type of game that said 'Try this level, its damned near impossible', I would likely never play it.<P>All I want is something that works.  Not something that almost works.  Not something that when cast, if I when the lottery, is effective enough to be interesting.  I want a charm that I can use reliably, a mez that isnt constantly resisted or a pet that doesnt die when the enemy breaths on it.<P>Hell, I would settle for a charm that works but uses ALL of my mana when cast.  It seems there are ways to make things work, yet not be all powerful.  Oh well, Im reaching a VERY high level of frustration on this stuff.  Ive played around 12 characters now to around level 20-25 and have discovered that none of them 'work' as advertised.  I have a cleric that cant heal, a wizard that cant nuke, an enchanter that cant enchant (or charm), a shaman that couldnt train in alchemy and a rogue that couldnt do anything..Well, it sounds like the wizards have been addressed.  Maybe I'll try that one again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000041&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well all I can say, is that they've got two weeks if they do nothing I'm gone (Why two weeks, my next CC payment isn't due for three). Its bad enough when you're forced to camp for every item, play 25 hrs. a day just to keep up with your guildmates so you can hunt with, plus the fact that the servers are over capacity by about 700 ppl on average. Now, the class that I put hell of lot of time in gets screwed over, while there's many other problems with the game besides adjusting classes every patch. You've got 2 weeks then you'll squeeze no more cash from me.

</FONT><HR>Hate to say it, but this Enchanter thing so mirrors the wizards plea for balance. All the angry enchanters, and Verant saying "You are fine move along nothing to see here etc.." <P>I feel for you the enchanter class, perhaps Wizards and Enchanters can unite in some sort of action against this foul treatment.

</FONT><HR>Now verant really pissed me off. I have no problem with other two classes getting buff up(welp, maybe not necro but they got something new). I think magician truly deserve the pet buff. BUT I rely on my animation to deal damage for me when I go soloing at high level for 3 reasons, 1. our casting and recovering time is incredibly long, which means we can't chain blasting like wiz/mage, <BR>2. yeah so we can debuff, but with the mana we nerf on mobs wizard can use it to cast IC twice. <BR>3. my animation is my best tank I can get when I can't find a group to join. With the "buff from dagger" my animation finally come closer in damage comparing to other classes. <P>Anyway the patch just nerf our ability on soloing, and verant is happy about it. Hello!! Verant?

</FONT><HR>Just thought I'd throw in a bit about a quick test i performed with a necro guildmate.  Both of us summoned our level 29 pets, both confirmed as the same level pets, 2 tests.  I casted alacrity on mine, theirs got their augment pet spell (not sure which one, but its appropriate version).  The pets were both dual wielding daggers.  The first test, the necro pet won with 25% health.  I have no problem at all with that figure, however...  The second test I casted obscure, alacrity, berserker strength, and rune on my pet, the necro pet still having only the augment spell.  The necro pet won yet again, however (and this surprised me considering my pet should have had a 300ish hp advantage), the necro pet still had well over 40% health.

</FONT><HR>    In a number of his recent posts Abashi has made references to Enchanters "being a quiet group" and normally we are, we just adapt.  But I see no way to adapt to this circumstance, sometimes I have to solo if I want exp, it is part of the game.  This ability has been taken.  I doubt with this new "Fix"  I will even have enough mana to reverse kite something long enough for my pet to do the damage required, it was barely sufficent before.  And if they think I can let my pet tank for me... well, someone at verant needs to go play an enchanter for a bit solo and try that out.  I am tired of taking it, maybe I will go check out the necro board and learn some effective *****ing tactics, they never seem to have a problem like this.<P><BR>Psylok</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000048&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
