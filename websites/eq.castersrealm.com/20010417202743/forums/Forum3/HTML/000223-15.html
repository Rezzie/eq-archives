</FONT><HR>This post turned into a longer one than I meant it to.  Oh well, basically I'm against the walkout and I don't want this to turn enchanters into a hated class.  If you want an explanation to that, read at your leisure.<P>First, to JK, you're an enchanter, not a magician, don't start with DD, finishing with it is fine (although usually unnecessary), but don't open with it.  Also use your color flux spell to get an opening if you're under attack, back up a few steps while your spells recycle, then blast.  Nothing wrong with developing your own strategy, just be able to recognize when your current one doesn't work, and try something else.<P>As for the nerf, I haven't felt it.  I think the real complaint by most of us is about how Verant views us players, and that complaint has been around for a LONG time.  In fact, I've been playing since beta 3, and I recall complaints about Verant's responses (and response time) even back then.  <P>100,000 heads are better than 20?  I disagree.  Verant cannot possibly read/listen to every valid complaint there is simply because there are TOO many of them.  Verant cannot possibly respond to every valid complaint for the same reason.  And even worse, the complaints are conflicting.  So what's the real issue?  That your character was adversely effected and now suddenly you realize that Verant can't make YOU happy all of the time?  Of course you're not always going to like the changes they make.  Are you going to complain IF Verant finally decides to bring in item enchantment and it works differently than YOU want it to work?  Suppose they change it to work that way, how many others do you think will complain then?<P>Bottom line:  I have more fun playing an enchanter than any other class.  I just wish I'd created one sooner. <P>At this moment IMHO, the item enchantments would be a cool addition.  The nerf didn't effect me at all (I never gave my pet a dagger and got along just fine), and frankly, I don't think the added spells that necros got are worth anything.  They remind me of WTYH and DDD.  All this complaining is giving me a headache, and makes me wonder if people are going to start looking at us the way I looked at ALL wizards about 6 months ago.  (In case you don't remember, there was a HUGE fiasco about how horribly weak wizards are compared to...everyone)  It started like this, and snowballed into a a lot of hot air.  Then at some point it just vanished.  Bah, to turn this minor nerf into that would make me sick, don't think that Verant hates you or doesn't care; they care because you are a customer and they want your money.  They tell us lies or talk in circles because that's the way the people who pay them tell them to talk (to save face or to save a long explanation or for some other reason that only makes sense when its your idea), I know because I have to do it to my customers and I HATE it, but I do it anyway because I want to get paid this week.<P>I have more, but I'm going to stop here while you can still focus on the screen...maybe.<P>Currently Rothos of Lanys T'Vyl(sp?)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000352&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I was not responding to any single respondent to this thread.  What makes you think I was specifically targeting you?  As I look at the first post here it appears this was a thread created by Baelish not JK?!?<P>Correct this is really a general discussion about a number of fundimental changes that have been made to Enchanters that have negatively reduced the breath of our capabilities.<P>Correct it is not just about high level Enchanters and I have never in any of my posts tried to imply that is was.  I am level 44 and it is a fact that many of the targeted mind control spells become less and less effective until nearly useless as you reach a point when you can go to the planes. I point this out to balance the low level statements that these skills are one of our stengths and therefore we should be content that we have them and can use them at all levels.  This is just not true!<P>If you are "totally unqualified to talk about the other issues" then it is fine to comment on what you know or think you know about pets.  But don't try to change this into a thread that is simply about pets.  It is not. <P>I am concerned with wholesale changes in a number of spells with no recompense. Case is point Whirl Til You Hirl (WTYH).  It was being abused.  Varents Enchanter solution - Render it useless.  The probable Varent Necro solution - Post ponderous apologetic editorials on how they feel so bad for what they have done that they must give Necros (what? - seven new spells) to make up for a nerf what really amounts to a minor nerf to one spell?  Well they WANKed us out of 3 spells in the WTYH line and we don't get anything but it was broke to we broke it more and we are fine with that.  Its true that their have been good reasons to "adjust" both the Necro and the Enchanter spells.  It is also true that is unfair to recognize in one case that flexibility has been removed and make up for it with new spells and in another case say "we are fine with it."<P>I short I was not attacking you or any single individual with the acception of the "Shut up and give me clarity @itch group.  Group one (the pet focused group) have made some valid comments; However, I was pointing out that there is more to this issue then just pets.<P>Frankly pets could be fixed fairly easily.  Abashi says they are defensive and that they are to be used in an emergency to give the Enchanter time to cast or escape.  Well then:<P>(1) Why do they need to melee at all?  Just give them heavy armour designed to suck up damage for n seconds.<P>(2) Why do they take so long to cast?  Hey its an emergency I need my pet (you know the one I was afraid to cast before battle as it would do dumb @ss things because of pathing problems).  (sit mem pet, stand cast pet, whistle a little death durge while you wait 40secs for it to appear) hahaha<P>(3) Why give it no taunt?  Its designed to allow me to cast. Sure go ahead cast anything you like - If we had it "tickle you with a feather spell" the MOB would ignore the pet and come at us completely unhindered and smash us into the dirt???<P>(4) Why give it no armour?  A pet explicitly designed to protect me that I have to tank for if I want it to live more then a millisecond  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">.  Once again take away melee and give it armour!  Give it an effect that effective reduces the damage it takes by a function of the number of mobs attacking it.  ie 1 mob hits for 100 per round, 2 mobs each hitting for 100 per round but encounter enchanted effect that reduces there damage (absorbs the force of their attack) and reduces it to 100/2 per mob, 3 mobs normally hitting for 100 each would hit for 100/3 ea., etc.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by JK:<BR><B>Uuumm not to flame you Rmulawa, but this discussion is about Enchanters in general not just the higher lvl ones..... i.e. I picked the topic of pets becuase at my lvl this is the topic within the current issue that affects me most,   <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"> and as I'm totally unqualified to talk about the other issues at hand I left them alone.</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000353&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ok guys, I think someone has lost sight of the real picture here. Not all classes were ever meant to be equal nor should they ever be, each class should have its own unique characteristics, weaknesses and strengths. And for the most part, many of the classes are balanced for effectiveness and playability. Everything could be better, but what in life is not this way? However, when I see how enchanters are slowly but inexorably pushed toward extinction, I wonder if maybe Verant is trying to rid itself of this class? maybe? Take whatever character you play... Do you believe that your character is ever too powerful? especially given that many mobs have an incomparable advantage over nearly every class? Probably not, but more importantly, do you feel that your character can and will truly contribute to a group effort due to your skillful use of that classes specialty? If you play an enchanter, the answer is probably again, no. What can we do that another class cannot also do? I'll leave this open for thought, anyway I've griped enough to make me smile, lol. Happy adventuring...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000355&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>You know, on further reflection.... I'm really incredibly -GLAD- about this "nerf"<P>See, the people I see *****ing are the ones who started playing Enchanters because "They're the pampered class" or "No problem getting a group dude, I got crack!" and even the "I get PETS and DD and CHARM and A MILLION SPELLS" types of fools.<P>Its really easy to find them. They're the same people who ***** that we can't control the pets. Or describe their play style as "Well I DD it then run around for 5 minutes while the spell recycles, then DD again." <P>Good Riddance. Have your walkout. Please don't come back.<P>In beta, I played -alot- of classes. Every priest and every caster and rogues bards and monks to boot. Nothing really high, my highest level was 16th. From that experience, it came down to a choice of two characters "First" (I knew I'd have multiple characters).. A Wizard or Enchanter. Due to some popular misconceptions about the classes at the time, my guild requested the Wizard choice, and I obliged.<P>In hindsight, a bad choice, but now I'm at three level 50 characters.. the most recent being my Enchanter. Through every character, it always grated my nerves when I kept seeing "Wizard Enchanters" who just nuke and "Magician Enchanters" who think their pet should be tanking, and the "Vendor Enchanters" who hand out clarity and swift to their group before going afk, and all the other sorts of combinations that arose.<P>Yet, most of those types of players of enchanter characters left the class. Switched to something more appropriate to their playstyle. That all changed one fateful patch when the spell Clarity was added (Yes Virginia, Clarity is a POST BETA Spell) and nearly immediately the class was flooded with a bunch of idiots. They whined about all or nothing DD, so the 4th and 12th level DD got changed. Thankfully their whines about the pet being uncontrollable and further DD issues got ignored. Thankfully.<P>Personally, as a level 50 enchanter, I'd like all pets past 12th level removed. Clarity items found on Giant Rats, and Swift Like the Wind items found on Giant Bats. The class is not a buff vendor, no matter how much the subpar players want to make it that way.<P>------------------<BR>--<BR>Senir, Erudite Arch Wizard<BR>Bartab, Ogre Weaponmaster<BR>Iden, Erudite Mindmaster<BR>Fires of Heaven, Veeshan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000356&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>i think that all you enchanters need to quite complaining about this whole thing.  i was reading something about a guy who was polanning a boycott???what is wrong with you people? past level 20 you are insane to be soloing and you will have a tank to take care of the melee part of the battle. i also think pets should be veiwed as a nice bonus to a class. Us wizards dont even get pet spells. an all our spells are damage spells.  there is no variety. enchanters have the greatest variaty of all the classes . so if you guys want to keep complaining about a minor nerf, go ahead but as for me i am going to be playing everquest=p</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000357&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Whine Whine Whine, Try being a warrior and tell me how hard it is to solo, you are the wealthiest class on Norrath, I know that is hard thing to endure...Im glad Encs got nerfed, and I hope they would Nerf Necros and mages more too, it would force you all to group up more.  Enchanters are a needed entity in a good group, and if verant makes them a kick ass solo class, they will never want to group. (you can see this with necros, they rarely ever group and always seem to be solo, or farming) I get annoyed when I see a necro of the same level soloing something that I would not even be able to take down to half health b4 I had to run.  Bottom line is quit *****in, you guys aint got it nearly as bad as others!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000358&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Anon WHINE WHINE WHINE....Read the posts, we arent asking to be a good solo class.  Most of the complaints are that we cant contribute enough to groups.  We aren't asking for more DD.  We want enchant items.  If you think Jewelcraft is so profitable, give it a shot.  Max jewelcraft and see how much money you can make.  This gous even more so on older blue servers.<BR>I DO have a tank.  She can solo some exp giving mobs.  Want me to tell you how to play YOUR class?  Probably not.  Quit pretending you know what we are talking about.  It is harder than you think playing an enchanter.  <BR>  If you are GLAD someone got nerfed...aww just go away.  I don't think any ENCHANTER here is asking for other classes to be nerfed.<BR>  THIS WAS NOT A BUG FIX.  GZ has suggested it as a tactic before.  That means Verant knew about it.  Quit saying it was something we shouldn't have had in the first place.<BR> Someone earlier said higher charisma is the answer to my charm issues.  Well I have a 221 charisma and still get those 1 second charms all the time.  So don't count on that.<BR>  <P>------------------<BR>Leirra Wayfarrer<BR>Enchantress at Large</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000359&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well, now I am being called the wealthiest class in Norrath? That's interesting, since I am broke, and I still haven't gotten all my spells! Wow... I'm just sooo rich!  Try making jewelry sometime...it, along with all the other tradeskills out there costs a FORTUNE to master! I'm not a master jeweler, and I won't be for a long time becuase I can't afford to do it.  I don't have clarity..so that leaves me out on my own. I spend day after day trying to find a group. You know what they ask? Can you clarity??  Well.. no, I can't. So what then? Let's see... I'll do what I did the other night. I attempted to solo a ogre guard that was blue to me! Yep..LOW BLUE in fact. I had to run to the zone twice. It resisted all my spells, and killed my pet too fast to do anything.<BR>I also have a warrior character. She ROCKS!  I don't know what you are saying, because there have been so many times where shes' taken out yellows to her..not just one level, but two levels ahead of her. I wouldn't do it all the time because it just takes forever to wait after you are hurt that bad...but it can be done, and sometimes with relative ease.<BR>yes, after a certain "age" in the game, people are meant to party more. That's a given for ALL the classes!  We aren't complaining about that! So stop telling us to shut up, because I bet a lot of you are the same people who whine when something happens to your class!<BR>We are making constructive criticism of the last straw... don't you get it?? IT wasn't just the pet, it was IT! The last thing we were going to take before we decided we'd been quiet long enough.<P>I'm sick of people flaming, and so forth. It's not worth my time.  I put a heck of a lot more energy and time into my enchanter than any other character I play, and it's not worth it after a point.  I have played almost every class and race in this game...and Enchanters level THE SLOWEST out of them all, and I even play a human enchanter, so I get that lovely xp bonus. <P>I haven't told anyone to shut up when they complained that they couldn't take out evens, or yellows, or even reds to them anymore because Verant "nerfed" them... but when they did this final thing to enchaners..yes, I'm going to speak up, so please, DO NOT TELL ME TO BE QUIET!!<P>and besides..if all you are going to do is tell us to shut up, then don't bother reading this thread!<P>We are all saying the same thing, and there are a heck of a lot of us saying it..so therefore that makes it even more valid!  All of you out there telling us to stop whining because we can't solo... well you know, most of us are not complaining about that!! So get a clue, and read what all this is really about. Thank you!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000360&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well, <BR>just two incidental things :<P>1) I tried to solo G Skel (blue to me), for a refresher, in rathe (Im 32) with my broken pet. Well to tell the truth I didnt noticed much of a difference. What still worries me the most is its lack of hp and ac, not the damage it deals. In fact it was rather fun.<P>2) I tried to stay ther and work ou how I could use it in a group. After 3 ooc, no one bother to reply. So I decide to hit the travel button and offer clarity for a sow. All of a sudden I get 5 replies of people who wish to have clarity in their group. not an enchanter, mind you but clarity.  *sigh*<P>Sometimes, it strike me that it would be nice to see -this- spell removed (clarity). After all we werent supposed to have it in the first place.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000361&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I was trying to stay out of the battle on this issue, but after reading through the first twelve (!) pages, I finally had to respond to a few things.<P>Regarding soloing:  From level 1-26, I rarely found a group.  No one knew what an enchanter could do.  They wanted hacker/slashers and nukers.  The finesse of crowd control wasn't appreciated.  Therefore, I HAD to solo quite often, even though I prefer joining a group for the simple camraderie.  The ONLY reason I had groups after 26, was that I accidently met some great people who happened to play on approximately the same schedule.  After one group, we added each other to our friends lists.  After 29, I had many more grouping invitations solely because of clarity.  However with the outrageous server overcrowding, decent groups are becoming more rare every day.  My former group of three need to be rounded out, but we can't find enough places to hunt effectively.<P>Secondly, regarding the pets:  I believe enchanter animations are absolutely necessary for any unguilded enchanter to get above level 20.  If you aren't twinked and don't have friends powerleveling you, you know exactly what I mean.  Our animations are typically low blue at those levels.  Charm is too unpredictable, frequently causing numerous deaths.  Since lower level groups don't want us, and charm can be broken in seconds, an animation is one of the few ways to survive and gain experience.<P>Thirdly, regarding mages and necros: I'm delighted mage pets were improved.  I have the option of attempting to become a mage myself if I want a super pet like that.  I congratulate you on the improvement!  For the necros, although I know many of you chose a necro so you wouldn't have to group, you have to admit the life tap and some additional spells can be helpful.  I'm sure you'll find a way to use some of the group-friendly spells while soloing.<P>Regarding the furor over the changes:  I have to admit it's not so much the change to pets that upsets me, it is the Verant ATTITUDE.  I cannot believe any adult could honestly believe that they could be so rude, so arrogant, and so insensitive in their comments as both Gordon and Geoffrey have been.  I am utterly appalled at the incredibly poor customer service, and especially at the ignorance that allowed these comments to be made and published to the world at large.  The arrogance and blantant discourtesy overwhelms me.  A simple compassionate and softly worded message could have turned away quite a bit of the wrath expressed here.  Instead they deliberately chose to take an approach guaranteed to alienate their customers.  Why?!?  This is management 101 here, nothing new, no unique concepts.  Just simple courteous customer service.<P>To be honest, it won't be so much of a walkout for me, but a gradual decline in my enjoyment.  I am already investigating two games under development, and am looking for others.  As soon as a new one appears that will hold my interest, I will happily cancel my account.<P>Sorry for the long diatribe and thank you if you made it this far.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000364&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Originally posted by Senir:<BR>See, the people I see *****ing are the ones who started playing Enchanters because "They're the pampered class" or "No problem getting a group dude, I got crack!" and even the "I get PETS and DD and CHARM and A MILLION SPELLS" types of fools.<BR>------<BR>Not all of us, you blind and ignorant fool.  How dare you pigeonhole enchanters in such a way!  Why don't you climb off your high horse and get your feet back on the ground where they belong!  I mean, you have the perspective of a 50th level character PRE-NERF!  It affects you only to a small extent.  Some of us have to level through the harder times and don't have it as EASY as you did, so PIPE DOWN AND LOOK AT THE WHOLE SITUATION BEFORE YOU FLAP YOUR BLEEDING GUMS AT ME YOU POMPOUS BUFFOON!!!<P>Good Riddance.

Actually, we don't do much of anything useful anymore, as jewelcraft has flooded the market, and made our "moneymaking" skill worthless.  Speaking of jewelcraft: As good as people have said it is, does anyone realize how much money needs to be put into it before its even useful?  What other class has to sink thousands of plat into a skill to make it usable?  I can only think of shamen and thier Alchemy skill which, by the way, still does not function properly...  Jewelcraft aside, what ELSE can we enchanters do that NO OTHER CLASS can do?

</FONT><HR>--naturally I'm dissappointed that we seem to have gotten the shaft with this recent patch, but saying we're useless now is BS.  I may only have 18 levels but up to this point I can still always solo blue cons and if at full health and mana even cons are no trouble using quickness on my pet and languid pace/DoT/fear on mobs.  We're not meant to be a solo class to begin with and in case you hadn't noticed our quickness spells are appreciated by all melee classes as are the strenght/speed debuffs we can cast on mobs.  <BR>-- for those of you on a team-pvp server WE SHOULD BE THE RICHEST CLASS<BR>with illusion spells we can easily PK unsuspecting victims.  I managed 73 kills as opposed to 14 deaths PKing in BlackBurrow as a DE enchanter with minor illusion.  We can DOT/mes/root then DD and move in for melee and finish off most yellow cons that we've caught off guard.  I've even been able to take on two yellow cons at a time.  So for those of you whining on VZ/TZ stop it because as of now i have over 1000pp at level 18 and am hated by nearly every barbarian and human that frequent qeynos hills/blackburrow/everfrost.<P>~Iriani<BR>~Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000371&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Senir:<BR>Yet, most of those types of players of enchanter characters left the class. Switched to something more appropriate to their playstyle. That all changed one fateful patch when the spell Clarity was added (Yes Virginia, Clarity is a POST BETA Spell) and nearly immediately the class was flooded with a bunch of idiots. They whined about all or nothing DD, so the 4th and 12th level DD got changed. Thankfully their whines about the pet being uncontrollable and further DD issues got ignored. Thankfully.<BR>[/B]<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Who cares if it was post beta, several spells for all casters classes are post beta.  That is a poor argument and totally off the whole problem here.  I have leveled with groups, with charming and with pets.  That is or was the beauty of the enchanter class, the player's ability made you successful.  What most irriates me is the caustic replies from Abashi in address one of our concerns.  A good enchanter will find what works for them adapt to it.  A bad enchanter will fail with the class.  What also bothers me is the silently nerfing of the tashania spell.  You realize now that a shaman will lower magic resistance twice what we can?  Their spell also lowers all the other resistances too or most of them.  There has been many good issues raised here but all we get is these short snide remarks from their PR guy.  All classes seem to need varied work on them (rogues and warriors spring to mind quickly) but how can any serious work on the improvement of the classes be done without our input?  It can't and that is the problem right now with the classes.  The mages finally got fixed what was always broken and they needed that.  To fix that they had to nerf all the classes that have pets.  They gave to the necros a spell or two that is barely adequate to make up for the nerf they suffered to fix the mage pets.  Good, that's fine too.  The other spells they are planned to recieve though have nothing to do with their pets.  It is to make them more group friendly but being more like the enchanter.  The enchanters who Verant acknowledged they overlooked get a "we Ok with the pets now" comment from Abashi.  Then we get compared to shadow knights and shamans in regards to pet.  Apples and Oranges.  They are both fruit but they sure taste different.  If Verant would just listen openly to the comments and suggestions from the various classes many of the problems could be fixed or lessened.  <P>I would myself like to see the removal of the animation and it to be replaced at lvl 1 with a charm spell that is more reliable.  My favorite saying in game to anyone is "you've got to love me, I'm enchanting" and that should be true. Charming and playing with the mind should be my trade in combat, however the well charm works currently, I will only use it when I am hunting with a small group at least.  There is 1 to 4 others I group with regularly in my guild and we can kill consistantly because I can charm with someone backing me up.  There is no reason for the way charm works currently.  Why on one cast of charm I get a pet for a few minutes then get him again for a few seconds then get him yet again for about 30 seconds?  <P>Another point, sheesh didn't mean to go on forever like this, is the role we play in the planes.  Every raid is typically built around clerics and enchatresses but guess what, you will see 6 to 8 clerics and 2, maybe 3 if there is enough slots available, enchanters.  The reason is not lack of enchanters at that level on my server.  The whole issue comes down to what we can do up there.  In Fear, I can mez many different types of mobs, not all but enough to make or break a raid there.  Last night I was the only enchanter in fear so I was almost always oom the entire night covering the needs of clarity, insight, brillance, augmentation and then mezzing on multiple pulls.  In Hate, I can mez far fewer mobs there, and that was before my tash spell silently went from 65 to 31.  My debuffs there are highly resisted if I want to waste the mana for little benifit on the spells.  I get relegated again back to doing clarity and the other unique buffs I currently have.  In Sky, I have yet to live long enough to see after a resist on mezz if I can eventually get one to stick.  So I can not effectively do crowd control in sky and I don't even try to do much damage because 1, it is not my job to be a damage dealer in the raid and 2, I get resisted too much and do too little damage when I do actually hit.  So to re-cap, the one plane I can actually seem to do my job fairly well is also the one plane I have no class specific armor on.  <P>Verant brought all these posts on themselves with their comments and lack of listening.  To those that comment that these posts are whining, it's not, it's a class stating what is not working with their class and exercising the right to express themselves.  I love my lvl 50 enchantress but I am quickly getting discouraged with what feels like a snubbing of my concerns from Verant.  They never listen though and when they are caught in the wrong they spin it too much to be believable even when they tell the truth.  Case in point is the claim that they fixed the mage pet bug in 2 days.  Not a chance, the mages have been point that out til they were blue in face and when verant finally realize that cold draft was because their pants were at their ankles they spin it to having caught it and fixed it in 2 days.  We the customers do not deserve to be treated like that, we may not be always right but we should be listened to.  That is what this whole thread started from.  We want to be heard on some of our concerns.  We love the game and want it to me even better.<P>Sorry, had to get this off my chest, it has been brewing for almost a week now.  =-)<P>Kyrelsis Fizzlesalot<BR>Lvl 50 Enchantress<BR>Bristlebane<BR>"But you've got to love me, I'm enchanting"<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000372&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I shall be joining the walk out also. I have gotten many, many, many of my friends to buy and play EQ and now it seems that I will not be able to play with them at later levels because of the specific role set aside for the enchanter. Don't get me wrong, I love my enchanter but I feel there are a few changes that could benefit everyone. One thing that could make the pet a more usefull would be if he rcognized our spells, for instance, my pet should determine that the moster has been mesmerized and discontinue the attack. Ofcourse they could compensate us in other ways also. Just as many people have stated, fine tuning of the charm spells would be very welcome. It seems only logical that as the spell weakens there would be a sruggle for control that would alert the enchanter to the fact that his spell is about to break. Right now most groups I find do not like it when I use charm because of it's unreliable duration. The addition of 'group' spells would be nice also, since that appears to be the role cut out for us, such as clarity. I myself would not mind if the animation was taken out to be replaced with more reliable spells. If I am not supposed to be a damage dealer then give me spells that work well in other areas. A mind is a terible thing to waste, screw with it!<P>I know these things have been mentioned before but I just want my voice to be counted among the many unsatisfied customers out here.<p>[This message has been edited by Megalomaniacat (edited 02-05-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000373&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
