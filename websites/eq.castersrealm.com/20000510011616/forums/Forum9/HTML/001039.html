</FONT><HR>Well its happened. Last night I go to aquire the Golden Rod fromthe Froglok priest in Guk AGAIN!. After my 4 failed attempts at clearing the room the day before..., damn green aggro's. Well a Higher level Druid was there camping priest as well for an enchanter he has not even rolled yet........ <P>I really didn't get mad at him its his own business to be there and even gave him clarity. He did though tell me when he was leaving and got the rod like 5 minutes after I left. So he left spawn free. I ended up coming back 20 minutes and the priest spawned with another rod and had a friend help me but thats another story.<P>My basic point is this. The specific class quests should have there final item the item that they they get once the quest is completed be No Drop as well. Kinda makes it a shallow victory for your character if you have yout 50th lvl character get it for you.<P>And takes away the spawn for Enchanters or any class that needs that item themselves not there twinks to get it for.<P>I know I probably sound like a whinny ***** but some people can't wait hours upon hours for stuff to get freed to spawn. Some of us have lives responsibilities etc. I dont necessarily mind waiting for a Quest spawn if the person camping it needs it themselves for THAT particular character. But camping for there twinks when peoples main characters need it more is just plain wrong.<P>Some items like quests that have 1 spawn the final item should be no drop. Most of the Armor quests I know of have multple sources and should remain how they are but the specialized Sol Ro quests should have there items be No drop. <P>There is nothing like earning something with the person who plans on using it. Much more sense of accomplishment then just having your higher level character do it or buying it. <P>You all can flame me about my opinions and say I'm full of sh*t but its probably cause you do what I mentioned camp quest items with higher level characters and dont like the idea of no drop final items =P. Though those are probably the same people who get allowances and mooch of there parents and don't know the feeling of accomplishment of earning a pay check either.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/biggrin.gif"><P>Shimmer Gemsparkle 35th lvl Enchantress<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=001039.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General&TopicSubject=Class+Specific+Quests+and+twinks">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I must respectfully disagree.  To each his own, everyone pays their money each month and therefore has the right to play the game as they wish.  Not to the extent of being a putz, but doing any quest they wish.<P>I did all the enchanter quests with my enchanter, not a higher level character of mine, but what's the point and who cares if I dug up a level 50 toon of mine (which by the way I don't have, my ench is my highest)?  The quests will get done one way or another, what difference does it make what character does it.<P>You mentioned that you don't have the time to spend hours upon hours camping quest items, and that you have real life things that keep you from camping the stuff.  May I suggest that you be HAPPY that you are doing the enchanter quests, they are so EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY to do compared to other class quests.  With the enchanter quests, you can do any or all of them AT YOUR LEISURE.  Have you ever done the Cleric quests?  How fair is it that a stupid item spawns on the ground once every 4 hours, with a server FULL of clerics who want it?  Sitting on a stump in Kith waiting for a stupid icon to spawn, and having ANY other class there waiting for it is a drag, cleric or not.  <P>In general, class quests are extremely frustrating, with the exception of enchanter quests maybe   <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">  If you are having bad experiences with these quests, or they are causing you to not have fun while you play, may I suggest that you never try other class quests to save your sanity.  Just be glad that the frog you are hunting only has ONE class quest item, so the traffic there is minimal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=001039.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General&TopicSubject=Class+Specific+Quests+and+twinks">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

But it goes without saying that if I wanna camp something thats suppose to be for my class and someone is there solely to twink one of there own characters that kinda Bullsh*t.

What business does anyone else have being there except the person who can use it. Also Being a Dungeons and Dragons fan for 13 some years. I can understand and appreachiate the experiences and trials of doing things for myself the enchanter not the 50th lvl toon where the quest is no problem. It's like going to war and injuring yourself and getting a purple heart. Yeah you have the metal but your still a cop out for not doing it yourself or the way it should be done.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Mezzmo:<BR><B><BR>You mentioned that you don't have the time to spend hours upon hours camping quest items, and that you have real life things that keep you from camping the stuff.

I'll stay with the enchanter quests. I will say though,  would you like it very much if you needed something and I was there with a 50th lvl necromancer waiting on the same thing you wanted as well. Even though he wants it for a twink he has not rolled yet. Though Have you ever camped High priestess Mitty and Gynok Moltar for the paw of opolla??. long spawn and drops the 3 rings rarely and the gold very seldom and Gynok does not always drop the plat ring and is a roughly 8 hr spawn. Again if my Enchanter was there and was camping it would you like it very much um no.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Mezzmo:<BR><B><BR>In general, class quests are extremely frustrating, with the exception of enchanter quests maybe    <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">  If you are having bad experiences with these quests, or they are causing you to not have fun while you play, may I suggest that you never try other class quests to save your sanity.

</FONT><HR>Well try to consider the other side of things for a second. While I can understand your frustration at having someone there to take the item you wanted it doesn't sound like it was too horrible of an experience. <P>I also do not have alot of time to spend on the game at night (my wife is telling our friends she is a computer widow  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">) but I support the right to make twinks for one reason (which I will get to in a sec). I am currently 40th level and it has taken me 5 long months to get there. When I hit 50th I want to go on Dragon runs and Plane runs whenever possible (probably another 2 months til then though  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/frown.gif">).<P>Unfortunatly people do not go on Dragon/Plane runs everyday and I anticipate having to reserve this for weekends. Maybe not even every weekend but I am not sure.<P>My point is in the mean time I plan on having a twink that will shoot up through the levels and I want that twink to be as powerful as can be. What else is there to do once you have hit 50th? Sure I could start him from scratch and play him to 50th the hard way but quite frankly I don't have that much time. If it takes me 7 months to get to 50th with one class then I have to assume it will take me 7 months with any other class as well (unless I twink it). <P>So as long as those people out there that are gathering items for thier twinks are courtious I don't mind waiting in line at all (or coming back during off hours). Try to see things from thier perspective. I am not sure how much time it has taken you to get to 35th but think about trying to do that all over again just so you could see what life was like as a Shaman or Shadowknight. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=001039.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=General&TopicSubject=Class+Specific+Quests+and+twinks">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Class SPECIFIC quest items should be no drop.  Verant put no drop into the game and should use it where appropriate.  This would force questors to work for their items, instead of farming them.<P>I am not talking about general quests, or items that many people could use, just CLASS/RACE specific items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=001039.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=General&TopicSubject=Class+Specific+Quests+and+twinks">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I like it you say that you have twinked your warrior but by purchasing the items, how were those items acquired? Quite possibly by a farmer.<P>As to the camping of quest items, i personally dont have a problem with it as long as you arent farming them to the detriment of others. So you had to wait 20 mins to get the rod, thats pretty good in my book when if you want to join a group for a specific item it can take you hours just to get in the group. As to the paw quest, well why dont you just do it if you think it will upset a driud, i dont see a problem with doing that quest and selling the item.<P>I will camp items at times, eiher if im bored need money or want an item for my twink BUT i will generally move from the camp if a group comes up that will get xp off the mob and im not getting xp.<P>For example i have been clearing Najena laterly but this has mainly been to see what it is like before the upgrade and for a bit of fun. In the time that i have spent there i only saw about one person getting xp (buffed him a lot and made a friend for life i think  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/wink.gif"> ) the only other people for xp were right at the entrance. Now i did see a lot of people there to get items. The only harm that is caused is adding more items to the economy.<P>------------------<BR>Fryg Yourmind Lvl 43 Female Erudite Enchanter (Jewelcraft 187)<BR>Tryg Bravesheart Lvl 37 Female Barbarian Shaman &lt;Silent Power&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=001039.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=General&TopicSubject=Class+Specific+Quests+and+twinks">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well I will echo Mezzmo's statment about how easy this quest is. You should not have any trouble doing it. If you are upset at other people camping a spawn, Dont blame it on the other druid or neckro. Norrath is a small world with many players. In a word, it is very CROWDED! I say this out of frustration on my own efforts to do things in the game. But there are many other issues in the game that warrant fixing other than this quest. First this was the easiest quest that I have ever done in this game. Second if you are level 35,  just set up shop in lower guk and check the spawn fom time to time when you are going to lower guk. Do an ooc before you zone into lower guk. It is that simple. Also, the rarity of the spawn is non existant. I got mine on the second spawn. It is the way quest items are suppose to be. I am sorry that you are having trouble with other people camping it, but it is probably the best set up for a quest  that I have seen to date in everquest.<P>As far as other people doing the quest. I hole heartly support the idea of all classes being able to do the all the quests in the game. It makes for a better gaming experience. It breaks up the static kill level syndrome. Good luck with this quest. as I am sure you have already finished it.<P><BR> <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=001039.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=General&TopicSubject=Class+Specific+Quests+and+twinks">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think Nadax was dead on the money with his statement. The problem is not really the individuals that are farming items (well in rare instances maybe they are the problem....I am talking about on average). Once at 50th level (pre-expansion) people need to do something and if a Dragon/Plane run is not in the works then why shouldn't they go camp an item that they have always wanted. <P>The real problem is that there are too many people per server. I play on Vallon Zek and one HUGE advantage to playing there is that there is almost always someplace to hunt. Sometimes LGuk has about 20 people in it but from what I hear even this number is extremely low. This was when our server numbers were at about 800 people during prime time (now up to 1100) so LGuk might have changed a little in the last month. <P>When I hear that some of the older servers are at 2,500 people I cringe to think of what that must be like. Inevitably there are several 100 people that roam around the server looking for a group and never find them during any given night. This is a gross failure of customer service on Verants part all for the sake of turning a higher bottom line and if I were one of those people I would be pissed. <P>If you want to be mad at anyone for spawns being overcamped or taken when you need them then turn your blame on Verant. The problem of overcrowding should have been addressed long ago. <P>I would agree that class specific items should all be no drop.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=001039.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=General&TopicSubject=Class+Specific+Quests+and+twinks">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum9&number=9&thisthread=001039&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum9&number=9&thisthread=001039&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
