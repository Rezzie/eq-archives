</FONT><HR>I was wondering and would appreciate some help on this. IF in fact necromancer/mage pets were tested wrongly by Abashi, as any thought been give to the fact that these pets will now be even more efficient then warriors, now mind you i totally agree that these pets need fixing as this is something that should have been there in the first place. But a pure class warrior should definetly be able to take on a mage or necromancer pet and then some...And it would be unfair that this warrior could only do it with bladestorm...i mean we shouldnt have to get on of the games strongest weapons just to equal an other classes pet.<P>Just my 2 cents of Barbarian warrior<BR>i welcome comments<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000568.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General&TopicSubject=Difference+in+balance+mage+pet+,+necro+pet,+war">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I totally agree. A warrior should mop the floor with any pet and then some. Which rocket scientist decided "Well, let's make warriors, and now let's make spellcasters that can do everything warriors can't, and give em a pet that fights better."<P>This coming from a mage. And no, I don't think our pets need upgrades. I think necro pets need to be brough down to a more realistic level. And I think warriors need more skills, and a few advantages. In the end this is good for us because as it is it's difficult to find a decent tank when you need one.<P>The servers are flooded with DE Enchanters and Necros. Gee, I wonder why.<P>Everybody and their grandmother is a Necro.<P>You know, when I used to Wiz on muds, we used statistics to decide which classes get upgrades and which don't. Like if this week, 500 people made necros and 100 people made every other class - well *DUH* something might be wrong, Beevis.<P>For the most part, game balance is pretty good except when it comes to melee vs. caster. Casters have every advantage in the book. They can bind themselves wherever they want, they can teleport around all over the goddamn world, have all kinds of amazing powers. What can warriors do? Get their pants kicked by a necro pet?<P>This whole thing can be remedied pretty easily with healing potions, mana potions, bind stones, recall stones, etc.<P>What is the point of all the downtime in the game? Why do you make people sit all the time? Why not let em fight continuously? Sure, you can cast forever. But instead of costing time, it costs money (mana potions.)<P>Sure, you can swing that sword till kingdom come. Just make sure you have a buttload of healing potions. Or implement alcohol as a major healing agent. Like when you drink, you lose INT but gain health fast. Warriors don't need int, but obviously mages do. So for mages you'd have wine or something that decreased stamina but increases mana regen.<P>Instead of begging for a teleport, wouldn't it be nice to have a teleport stone or something for 5p? Need a port to Kelethin? Sure, no problem. What the hell is the point of all the sitting and waiting in the game. Do people think it makes it more realistic or it makes people more friendly when they're forced to sit around the bull**** while their mana or health comes up?<P>Instead, let's just cut the crap. I don't play to make friends. I don't want to call you "sire." And frankly, roleplay was dead before Elvis was. Just turn the damn game into the medieval Quake, kind of like everybody plays it.<P>If I want "community" I'll play UO. I don't want community. I want action. I want big ass fireballs. Big swords. Lots of blood. BOOM. SLASH. BASH. Breaking bones.<P>Okay, so I'm ranting and raving right now and I'm not thinking logically. Maybe some of my suggestions are off the wall. But hell, I think everyone understands my point.<P>Why is there SO MUCH WAAAAAITING for everything? And I won't accept the "for the $10 a month" argument. I refuse to believe anybody at Verant is so stupid as to assume if they make the game slow as molasses, people will play for years just to beat it.<P>People will play as long as they ENJOY it. Not as long as they haven't beat the game yet. You think I'm just gonna skyrocket to 50 and drop the game? Nope. You think by keeping me at level X for a month, you're gonna keep me playing? Nope.<P>I've dropped the game before and I can do it again. I've never even come close to 50. Level 23 is as high as I've ever gone. But I keep playing because I ENJOY it. It's fun. But it's becoming less fun, mainly because it's so ****ing slow, I almost have to give up having a life to keep playing.<P>Why does this game cater to no-life-having-spazoids? Why can't they make an online game for normal people? People who aren't wheelchair bound. People who don't have 13 hours a day of disposable time. Not that I'm knocking those people. If you're wheelchair bound, and EQ is a way for you to be happy, then God bless you. If you have a terminal illness, and have 13 hours a day to play and make you happy, again God bless you. But what about people like me????? What about other people, whose life doesn't revolve around video games? You know....the SILENT MAJORITY?<P>Until DSL comes to my neighborhood and I can play Quake properly, EQ is pretty much my only option. If EQ evolves into something I can live with, I'll stick with it even after DSL. If not (and I'm guessing it won't) then hasta la vista EQ.<P>Don't mind me folks. Just getting it all off my chest.<P>End of Rant.<P>Salian.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000568.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General&TopicSubject=Difference+in+balance+mage+pet+,+necro+pet,+war">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I disagree here. if I am reading you right, your saying that a warrior should be able to kill a mage and her/his pet easily. OH do i disagree with that. A warrior is a fighter, what verant has done with giving them magic resistance is totally bs. All in D&D the warriors are great fighters, deal out tons of damage, but their weakness was magic. magic would kick there ass easily. In EQ they think tht warriors should have high magic resist, I think its BS, but I will give it to them. But for a single warrior to take down a mage and her companion should be almost unheard of. If you go after the mage, the pet should rip you to shreads, if you go after that pet, the mage should blow you away. while warriors are great tanks, they can not come close to the damage that a mage and her/his pet can do. And to be honest, I think a pet alone should be able to take out a warrior. Think about it, the pet is a monstor npc, all high level monstor npc's hit for 90's and up, have around 4-6k of hps. A 50th level warrior is not going to be able to solo something like that. Now, the reasoning behind this is EQ is really a NON pvp game. it is against npcs. Since we are a non pvp game, the warrior should care less how good the pets are in the game. IF you play on a PVP server then you should live with it. the game was really designed to be groups, not people killing each other. <P>------------------<BR><B>Ebilena</B><BR><I> 29th level Erudite Magician of Tarrew Marr</I><P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000568.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=General&TopicSubject=Difference+in+balance+mage+pet+,+necro+pet,+war">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ok well id like to comment on that. I dont think that a warrior should be able to take on both a mage and her pet. I think a warrior should have the top hand versus the pet only. In a simple comparison that a summoned pet will never replace a true blood human,sure my character can think, i can use strategy but lets face it if i dont have top of the line equipment i get whopped by a mages toy. Now i saw you campared EQ to dungeons and dragons thats a big mistake, second edition has so many bugs that the 3rd one is coming out to fix them and take it from and avid dungeon and dragons players...mages were too powerful and with adequate spells could best the best of fighters in plus 5 gear. that being said, i simly think that warriors need to be re-affirmed as the leaders in brute melee combat. <P>i dont want healing, i dont want bind, i dont want spells i dont care about how good the pets get. I just want to make sure that my warrior is the leading authority on whopping monster butt <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>KOrugan Ironbear<BR>30th level warrior<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000568.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=General&TopicSubject=Difference+in+balance+mage+pet+,+necro+pet,+war">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I definately think that warriors could use some upgrades. <P>I played a warrior back when the game was first released. A lot has changed since then and the warriors are finally starting to be able to do what they are supposed to. I currently play a magician and I am glad they are fixing our pets, it is, after all, one of the cornerstones of our class and it was intended to be this way from the beginning. I think necro pets should be left alone, I think enchanter and shaman pets should be left alone. When the mage pet fixes go live all the pets will be in balance (IMHO) now what needs to be done is to fix the melee classes. <P>The new skill that was put in for warriors (crippling blow or whatever its called) is already getting some negative feedback. Abashi has said that there was a typo in it and it really shouldnt be there right now as they werent finished. We shall have to see how viable it is when they have it implemented correctly. I am not convinced that this will be the only enhancement needed to the warriors, as they really should be swashbuckling maniacs at higher levels even without weapons that come from 20 hour camps. I support the melee folks in their efforts to get reasonable changes made to their classes for some much needed improvements.<P>I have looked over some of the posts on various warrior, ranger, monk, etc boards to see how the melee folks are taking to this correction to our pets. Some of the posts I have seen go along the lines of "Why would anyone want a warrior now that the pets are so tough". I have seen naysayers of Abashis post about the difference between a pet and a real live warrior. Pets do not nor will they ever be a substitiute for a well played melee class. I will never turn down a melee class for any group that Im in and I actively seek them out for groups. Even if no other changes were ever made to warriors I would still want them for my groups, a smart warrior is worth a dozen pets. <P>It seems now that warriors may face (maybe this has always been the case Im not sure) one of the common dilemmas that magicians have had. Why would I want class X in my group when class Y does this, that, and everything else class X does. This is a tough time for the melee folks. Stick with it though, it seems that there have been many long overdue fixes and enhancements to classes lately and I dont forsee them deviating from this pattern any time soon. I am confident that melee folks will get enhancements that they sorely need.<P>Try not to let the "warriors are just damage sponges" crowd get you down, you melee folks bring a lot more than that to the table. You are the people that make it possible for the rest of us to do our jobs effectively. Many people try to classify certain classes as support classes but in truth we all play support classes. I am glad to support and be supported by melee, lets all hope they give you the enhancements you need to feel like the sword swinging, head bashing, axe wielding, rough and tumble, specialists of war.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000568.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=General&TopicSubject=Difference+in+balance+mage+pet+,+necro+pet,+war">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Great point Ebilena.<P>EQ is not designed to be a PVP game, it's kinda tacked on. If you want class balance as far as this game is concerned the way to look at it is not class v class in a duel but class v mob either solo or group.<P>As it is now, warriors add more to a group than a mage does. Warriors taunt, use bows, can switch targets to protect casters, time their slams and bashes to best use, disarm, crit hit, pull mobs and for the most part not get lost in dungeons  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/wink.gif"> Our pets deal a bit of damage for not a whole lot of mana. After our pets DW maybe that will even up a bit. <P>Solo though a mage can do things no warrior would ever dream of trying. Seeing one lone mage kick the bejeebers out of Oculys looks impressive, and it is. Of course all it takes is 2 low greens and the mage is probably running for her life. Likewise, as mages travel through Norrath their best defense and offense takes 12 seconds to get going. A warrior fights back almost instantly. And that best of defense and offense, the mage pet, is always the same. A warrior can work towards better and better equipment. I've never done any logs but a 50th exe axe/crafted warrior might not outdamage/outdefend a burn3/flamed 49th earth pet, but I bet a 50th bladestorm/cloak of flames/indicolited warrior sure would.<P>------------------<BR>Durynyth<BR>16 Gnome Mage<BR>"Pet, where are you?"<BR>Taunting Attacker Master<BR>"Uh oh"<P>Derenath Enikinteel<BR>50 Dwarven Cleric<BR>The Rathe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000568.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=General&TopicSubject=Difference+in+balance+mage+pet+,+necro+pet,+war">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Sounds to me like you wish EQ to be turned into another UO.  I think that warriors should get a teleport spell, bind, regeneration, have a weapon to proc whatever wizard spell they choose, have a drink that casts heal.  While we are making those changes, I believe that a wizard should be able to wear plate and wield a sword, after all mana runs out and we can't have that.  <P>To make a change to a class or to add an item to make it similiar to a different class is heading down the wrong road, the UO road.<P>I am happy that mage pets are getting fixed.<BR>As far as a necro pet solo'ing a warrior, that's crap.  I tried it three times last night and the warrior won everytime with 3bubs of health remaining.<P>If you think necros are all powerful try playing one and stop your *****ing.<P>Abby - wondering when i'll become the necro everyone is talking about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000568.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=General&TopicSubject=Difference+in+balance+mage+pet+,+necro+pet,+war">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I can tell you that in our consistent group, if we remove the warrior, the overall power of the group goes down about ten percent.  If we remove the Mage the overall power goes down about 40%.<P>In the mid twenties if the Warrior and Shaman group without the Mage they will do well, but not nearly as well as the Mage and Shaman.<P>The Mage is the cornerstone of our group, and to be quite frank I'd take a Mage ANY DAY over a Warrior in a group.  In a dungeon or out.<P>Sadly, I'm the Warrior.  I've seen all this.  My friends that I've grouped with for 20+ levels will tell you the same things.  Currently i'm the secondary tank in the party, behind the Earth pet.

</FONT><HR>Yeahright:<P>What can I say?  How bout Yea Right!  Give me a fricking break.  Your post is so unbelievable at to be absurd.  Warriors have NO PROBLEMS GETTING IN GROUPS.  Mages at 40+ its hell to get in a group.  I haven't played for over a week.  I get on for 1 hour a night and advertise for a group....NADA.  Get a life an quit spreading disinformation.<P>Verant isn't going to do a damn thing about Warriors or Mages either Nerfing or "Buffing".  There are realativly few mages playing EQ and there are ALOT OF WARRIORS.  If Warriors sucked so bad to play NO ONE WOULD PLAY ONE.<P>M.A.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000568.cgi&ReplyNum=000010&forum=General&TopicSubject=Difference+in+balance+mage+pet+,+necro+pet,+war">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">
