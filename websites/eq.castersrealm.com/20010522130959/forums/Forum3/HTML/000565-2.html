</FONT><HR>aaaaaaaiiiieeeeeee!!!!!!<BR>GFD! you whining sissies! balance, solo boo hoo! god damn ppl. SHADDUP and deal with it. there is nothing in the game a caster can do without a tank at high levels. sure you can sit there and camp guards all nite, wahoo, sure you can solo something in dungoens wahoo. but without a tank/healer or well rounded group, you will have a tough time. with my enchanter on prexus i solo'ed 3 greater kobolds at lvl 40, does it matter if a warrior could do the same? no it was very difficult and most of it was pure luck. try to get an SMR on yer own, sure maybe at 50 you can..but with a tank you can get much earlier. stop this constant whining that mages pets are better than the same level warrior, what ever happened to interaction? ive soloed a necro for the majority of 30 levels and it was the most boring time i have played in EQ, i had more fun buffing ppl in oasis for 3 hours with my enc. all these ppl that are whining about soloing and comparing to casters...play one, and you will see how valuable tanks are. ive also camped dwarves for days and hours on end to play 'catchup' to my guild....you wanna talk about mindless drivle playtime, i cant tell you how i would have much rather been in a group exploring lower guk caverns or swimming around in Kedge waiting for the next mermaid to cast upon us. you people have seemed to focus on the negative and just sit back and complain about it. why? cause its easy to do, its what the weakminded do, my sarcasim is not aimed at the author of the original post, but the ppl within this post that are not making any sugggestions at all and that are just posting "im at lvl 42 ranger and a lvl 42 mage pet can kick my A!" ....boy thats genius. take that same player and throw him in rathe mts looking for a rare spawn...you will have a hella easier time getting to it than him. the game is not about soloing, each play should compliment each other and it shouldnt matter if you solo well or not. again i go to the necro...another reason i stoped is no one wanted to group cause i was pretty much useless....sure i did alot of damage but ppl would rather take a necro/tank than me. i hope a few of you wake up and understand that tanks are needed.<BR>now for improvements...most of the suggestions are reasonable , all except binding. cmon, get real. thats like saying, necros should get SOW cause they run around alot, or get teleport cause they can use magic...binding melee is just not how the game has worked nor will it ever. deal with it. what they could do is maybe make a bindable zone, take a karanas for example, much like Gfay,(i know gfay is bindable cause of kelethin...but still)<BR>well ppl prolly wont ever read this but for those that do, i hope my point can be seen thru the sarcasm and crassness.<BR>hoof/inkey/kumkum</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000025&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Abashi is a complete moron. He "answers" a question by completely avoiding giving an answer, just rejecting suggestions.<P>"I've also discussed stats to the maximum depth that I intend to. These stats do mean something. You need to decide for yourself if what they mean is important enough for you to invest in them."<P>OK, well I've determined that I don't want to invest in STR since all it does is raise my MAX damage a point or two and allow me to carry more, I don't need DEX since all it does is let me proc/crit ~1% more often, AGL only raises my AC a couple points so it's almost worthless and STA only give me a few extra HPs. So where does that leave me as a warrior (or worse a Monk); stats that "mean something" but not enough to actually make a difference to my combat efficiency. Guess I'll invest my points in INT or WIS, at least I know they actually do something meaningful for casters; I just wonder why GZ has been so forthcoming in telling those casters how their stats affect them yet Abashi claims that "too much information on stats is bad for the game"?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000026&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have two level 50 characters.  A level 50 ranger and a level 50 Wizard.  I also have a level 36 Necro.  Being someone that has had an opportunity to examine both melee and caster classes in depth I have one thing to say about it.  The necro is by far the best _I've_ played.<P>When comparing the caster to the melee'er you can see there is a significant difference between the two.  Of the classes that are melee the Ranger is the weakest.  He cannot solo green mobs far below him and never a mob above him.  The monk can.  In the post where the monk compared himself to the mage's pet I'd have to say that he should feel lucky that the he could actually survive that battle.<P>The caster classes have problems too.  If one gets hit, damn, they are dead.  With the new anti-kiting code in the game my wizard has to be at a complete stop to cast.  Those casters with pets are an exception.  I use my pet in a major way (as a necro) to keep mobs off me so I can cast at the right time.<P>Verant is deficient in many ways in thier responses to the seemingly uniform complaints about character imbalances.  The first being that the classes are balanced for the game and against one another.  The keywords here are "uniform complaints".  The response from verant is also uniform ("they are balanced").  Let me ask a question of verant.  If there is such a uniform complaint by those playing the game, why is it that verant keeps uniformly denying it?  There are so many ppl telling verant this, why don't they listen?  We are playing the game in depth after all and I can't see the verant teams playing it enough to see what we see.  Besides their feedback from their internal testing house is biased (ppl don't like more work, ppl don't like others with strong personalities telling them the opposite of what they know is true without giving them an opportunity see the change and know they've been listened to).  <P>Keep in mind that the responses from verant are uniform because only a couple ppl are listening and making the final decision.  In my time managing ppl on the job I have learned the hard way to listen to those that tell you something no matter how out of place it sounds when you first hear it.  Those people know, they are the ones using the product and experiencing it first hand.  Verant is a failure here.<P>I've been reading the posts quitely and reading these forums silently  and have realized that there is alot of imbalance in the game.<P>To my detriment I chose two classes that are very weak when soloing.  The wizard, in a group is fantastic.  Casts at the right time give the wizard alot of punch, but when the wizard is out of mana he can't do anything (the mage and necro can, they just use their pets.)  The ranger is the exception when in a group.  Being the weakest melee'er he's the one sucking the mana from the healers (unless the other melee classes constantly taunt).  I've been chided more then one time by healers saying they need a real tank and that the small nukes the ranger has isn't worth their mana to heal me in battle.  I've heard this complaint stated over and over by fellow rangers.<P>The bottom line is that the wizards are out of balance because they are so focused on one task (DD) and that their mana use and damage output isn't significantly higher then that of the mage or necro and when you add pets, pet healing, fd, life tap, and many others the wizard is just a minor component of the team.  My suggestion is that if you need a group member and you can choose a mage or necro get them over the wizard. (Just my opinion).<P>So Verant just doesn't listen and has created a situation where there is a growing outcry over these imbalances.  Much of the problems don't show up till later levels around those where the mobs are mostly blue to level 50s.  Verant's claims hold some merit for lower level characters in the classes, but when the higher level mobs and classes are compared the imbalances are so blatantly obvious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>You cant do anything about it. Only reason why Verant can screw their customers like they do is because of the lack of competition on the MMORPG market. Wait a year or two and you will see that customer support like this is no longer possible due to the competition.<P>Pet casters are overpowered because their pets alone are better than any pure melee class.

</FONT><HR>Nah whoever started this wank get a clue man,<BR>I play a tank over any other class cause I cant sit and med I hate it.<BR> Give you an example im a 48th level paladin and ya I can solo some stuff even at my level though its tough I just dont care to do it. Mages will always be more powerful and more able to solo then any class in general wizard classes. This will and always will be this way. If you havent figured that out your in the wrong game.<BR>...<BR> Maybe as you say you are the first to get killed in a group then dont play when them folks I havent died since level 43 being I only group with the folks I can trust. And in many situations where we should have all gotten spanked we survived using some strategy and keeping a focused mind.<BR>...<BR> Binding near a dungeon no thx we dont need it and it hasnt ever been a big deal til now for some reason, you need to get we get less of a exp smack then a mage go play one when you die and lose 1 bar and 1/2 of exp you will understand.<BR>...<BR> But in overall ya whine to much warriors are nasty so are monks, thieves are speicalized class not the greatest mellees there a stealth class not a fighting class.<BR>...<BR>Wizards play trhere part we play ours so quit whinning and play the damn game.<BR>Tiberius V<BR>Fennin RO <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000030&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>ok we all know that casters and melee are NOT in the slightest bit equal.. we know that so dont deny it. We know that a melee has no chance what so ever to even attempt to solo a creature in the high levels even 5 lvls below the player except by some miracle. Two People say "so some clases are good at soloing and some are good at grouping". COME ON! give me a break here! Guess who is doing the best in the group the CASTERS.. guess who is doing the least.. ohh my the MELEERS! The point is that unless the melee can hit the enemy for half to full all the time they are basicaly there for caster shields, little pieces of manflesh to sacrifice to the oncomming rush of drooling flesh ripping monster. <P>Come on Verant just help us out a little bit here... alow us to be able to solo a monster 5 lvls below us like a caster and that isnt asking for much anyway. Yea grouping is fun and everything, but if all you are to the group is a monster shield then how fun is it really.. when all you are there for is to take the damage for the casters which in sense makes them MORE POWERFULL!!!! Come on here stop ignoring us and do SOMETHING.. because something is better than NOTHING!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000031&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>The problem with customer support is you only hear the complaints, and as such it is easy to get the impression that the complaints represent all your customers.<P>I would like to tell Verant that I think they are doing an excellent job of making the game fun for those that want a roleplaying adventure. I think that Gordon's answers are acceptable, and applaud his ability to make these tough choices, in the face of criticism.<P>Where I'm coming from:<P>I have several friends who have played most of the character classes (beyond 20th level) and I have to say that people that whine are missing the point of roleplaying games (for the most part, as there are some legitimate concerns) as my friends have a great time and have little trouble advancing any class/race combination. <P>Different PCs aren't supposed to be able to stand toe to toe in the same situation.  If they were, there would be no variety and no societal interaction. Despite how the (American) press portrays the Internet, I feel that most people use it to increase social interaction, rather then avoid it, and this game is all about social interaction, albeit in a fantasy realm where combat is prevelant.<P>The game isn't just about killing / leveling / killing / leveling (you can make it that, but then you won't have as much fun as the rest of us), its the process and the social interaction/coorperation of getting there, finding how my mages strengths can help the shamans weakness, and vice versa. <P>My friends play each character according to that class/race's strengths and weaknesses.  I didn't fully realize this, often complaining as others on how the melee classes are underpowered, until I dueled a lower level (19th) darkelf warrior friend with my (20th) barbarian warrior.  He kicked my butt, so are warriors unbalanced with themselves, of course not. Know why he won time and again? He equipped his character with the equipment that suited his attributes, I didn't.  He took advantage of his agi,dex, I didn't take advantage of my str, sta.  So what if you think a langesax and pgt look cool when a shiny brass halbard better uses your strength abilities.<P>Another case in point (for those who say that higher levels change things). Last night, I was watching a friend's guild try and assault the plane of hate, they all died horribly time and time again except the monks, who survived almost every time, NOT the casters. They used feign death to survive. Classes/races need to use realize their strengths and weaknesses and play to them, even roleplay the weakness.<P>I think that the classes are fairly well balanced from the view of the whole world as a single living entity. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000033&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>The main problem is that most of us are not used to playing Verant's game. I come from a rpg/MUD background that was much more traditional. Games where after a certain level, casters and melee had the ability to take down the same monsters (the difference being in time, effort and strategy). Where stats rule and essentially meant more than equipment (I'd take a warrior with high stats and a moderate weapon over a warrior with "god-weapon" and low stats. It just makes more sense). Where everyone had the same difficulty of death recovery, etc etc. <P>Verant's world is much different than this though. All melee characters of the same class are basically the same (with slight differences in power and learning rates) and are defined by their equipment (and they say they don't promote camping, eh?). Classes are balanced for group play not for soloing (which is another way to keep us playing longer and pay more money). How does this compare to traditional balance, let's see.... <P>For example, let's pretend that a warrior can solo a griffon with some difficulty . Maybe cleric could do it with a lot of difficulty. A magician could do it with almost no difficulty. They are all of equal level and have trained there skills to their limits and are good strategists. They should be able  to group and try to take on the High_Griffon_Overlord00 and with some luck and a lot of skill they might succeed. They should be able to take on the Griffon_Enforcer00 with no real problems as long as they support each other. Taking on regular griffons would be a waste of time and effort unless they were in it for loot or were bored. <P>In Verant's world, a mage, warrior and cleric would group together and only be able to take things a bit more powerful than the warrior can handle. They may gain an advantage as far as a lower downtime, less resources, etc, but they will not be able to take on a monster quite more powerful. No hopes of the small band of adventurers taking on the horrid dragon. It's more like the town and surrounding villages smothering the dragon with corpses. <P>Anyway, what's my point? I don't have one :P  I just felt like ranting.<P><BR>---Mage Cimmerion Darktide<BR>   very dazed and very confused<BR>    Brell Serilis<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000034&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ok here is my main problem with melee vs casters.  For casters their main stats actualy help them.  IE a wizard with a 90 int at 50th level is going to suck horribly compared to a 50th wizard with a 200int.  You know this, I know this, everyone knows this.  This goes the same for necros, magicians and druids/shamans/clerics with wisdom.  <BR>Now for meleers you would think str would make some difference.  But in truth as it stands it does not.  A 50th warrior with a 255 str does not hit much harder or more often than a 50th warrior with a 60str.  The only thing it lets you do is wear more armor and carry more loot.  Same goes for dex and agi and sta.  They might give you a "slight" increase to proc or a iddy biddy increase on AC or a slight incease on damage but realy it is not on the same par as the main stats for casters.  This is not right.<P>Vail Anarais, 36th ranger of Tunare.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000035&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>This is one of those cases when numbers do tell the story.<BR>Here's the numbers<BR>p = dx<BR>power = damage you can do X how long you can not get hit for.<P>Let's make 3 mobs. A PC warrior and necro and a NPC Lion, all level 35.<P>Warrior has 1200 HP's and can do 60 dmg a round with average being 30.<P>Necro has 1 HP and can do 500 dmg every 90 seconds using mana to a max of 2500 dmg plus has a pet with 900 HP's that averages 25 dmg every 3 seconds.<P>Now here's the imbalance.<BR>The mob's are ALL geared towards Caster bias. <BR>The 35 Lion has 1700 HP's and Hit's for 96dmg<BR>a round.<P>See the problem? All mbos are geared with the ability to do obsecne amounts of meele dmg while not of HP's so obscene that casters can't bring them down if they don't get hit. The power in Norrath outside of a group is that if it can't hit you and you can cast on it, you win.<P>As I've mentioned many times before, this is ONLY a problem getting to 50. However, the classes that can't solo(ie. they'd get hit by the mob) are NEVER rewarded for the MUCH tougher road they traveled to get to 50.<P>But lets be honest. Compared to mobs all classes suck. Verant made a wonderfull enviornment and put cheesy dynamics into it. All this in an effort to force you to group, yet they left in wild cards that  don't need to group by being cheesy and still have never given a reason for anyone(in terms of balance) to play a non soloing class.<P>~nerph<BR>Who will beat this same dead horse till Verant answers(for real) or a new game comes out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000037&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>This is just a guess....but knowing the way Verant works...I think it is a solid one.<P>We know Verant has GROUP on the brain.  I suspect their idea of balance is how much overall damage "while in a group situation and group supported" that each given class can do...averaged through the 50 levels.  In the case of clerics, enchanters, and other buff casters....I think they count it as a combo of damaged caused to the enemy plus damaged you saved your group from taking and / or healed.<P>In this one context...I suspect they are pretty close to correct about balance.  Problem is that context covers about 20 percent of game time....and about 5% on the red servers.<P>&lt;sigh&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000038&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

All the constrcutive criticism has been given by many people and is mostly valid.  His replies are just rhetorical garbage.  He needs to simply say, "not that classes are balanced", but " too bad, we arent changing anything, live with it".  A much more honest and accurate answer. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000040&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>  <BR>   I have just finished reading Abashi comments about how melee people are less powerful. I totaly agree with him, I had a duel with a warrior level 16 while i was level 14 shaman and kicked his butt no problem. I just rooted him and cast away. This shouldn't be.... It gives no chance to the warrior. Another thing i wish to discuss is the way verrant deals with the customers problem. I find that they always push the problems away with sayings that has nothing to do with it. We are the customers and we pay a deal of money to pay , why do they take our comments and toss them aside like they were piece of garbage? I mean if they cant do anything about what we say then why even bother giving us the chance to express ouselves if what we say is thrown in the garbage or tossed aside? If you guys think you can talk about problems in the game and that verrant will actually do something about it well you are dreaming in color. They dont care.. they make the money and thats all that is important. Which brings me to something else the gm's. Haaa... what a joke those characters have nothing to do. You ask for help and all they can say is " I am sorry there is nothing i can do its out of my power." All i say is that i am addicted to everquest but i can still see through verrant ways of business and its the worst customer service i have ever seen in my whole life</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000041&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well, it's about time someone actually said it.  You hit the nail on the head, and you can bet your arse that if their client base was a little older, they would be busting theirs with decent customer support and product improvement according to what the customer wants.  Gordon, your I don't care attitude leaves much to be desired.  Competition is right around the corner.

</FONT><HR>I agree with Caution. I got a lvl50 wizard, paladin and a lvl30 necromancer. <P>One easy fix to balance melee, casters and healers would be to raise the hit points of the melee classes.<P>One other thing is 2H slash seems to be not working as it should. I think its a statistical error made by Verant where you only calculate Damage/Delay and not consider double attack and other factors.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000043&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR> Well I am glad you think that the classes are balanced, and that tanks and casters are good as they are.... <BR> But the truth is that I play a warrior on Bertoxx and I have watched my friends that I made at very low lvl reach 50th and I am still in the upper 30's I play just as much as my friends and more so then some, but a caster can solo and get EXP at a ungodly rate using his pet... and the guy who started this thred is correct about a caster taking on MOB's that are higher lvl then himself, my warrior get's the hell beat outta him by a mob that is green and has been for serveral lvl's while a caster can kill it when yellow or red to him.<BR> also calling a Warrior the "master of melee" is such a load o bull.. the last skill we get is 35th lvl and our skill's cap out at alot lower then the other melee classes, like monks we would like to have different attacks like head butt, and maybe a Killing Blow... the last thing you threw ou way was a useless skill... Crippling blow (Laughing) gods man you say there is a stun in there never seen it work... and we have to be almost dead in the frist place for this to work.. I love the game but I have to say that I am really tired o hearing all this "Balanced" crap you keep spewing Just Say that your not going to do anything dont feed us that BS line please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000044&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Oh for sure. Casters are way to powerful compared to tanks. They can do everything we can't. They can bind anywhere, and they CAN BIND. What is this? I have to always spend time (20 minutes or so) looking for some one to bind me, and even than when I bind it's a whole distance away from my fighting grounds, that's already probably a wasted 2 hours - If letting casters be extreme soloers isn't enough.<BR>FIX MELEE CLASSES!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000045&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Casters are too powerful, but only a few specific casters are WAY too powerful. Magicians and Necros can summon pets that are as strong as a warrior of the same level as the magician or necro, or even better. This is absolutely ridiculous at a glance. I cannot conceive of a way they can justify this, and if you notice Abashi didn't even try. It blew my mind when they recently "nerfed" necro pets by not letting a weapon delay affect the pet's attack speed, as necro pets were too powerful, and at the EXACT SAME TIME made magician pets vastly more powerful by giving them dual wield via equipped weapons. Pets should NOT be a better substitute for a tank than a real tank, and in too many cases they are. <P>Starrk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000048&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ok here goes <P>After reading through all those complaints and flamers throughout the topic i have gotten myself to sayin a couple of words myself. I do beleive that classes are unbalanced in terms of solo capability and i do think that casters are more powerfull BUT i also think that casters are supposed to be more powerful in damage dealing (thez do have powerfull elemental forces at their disposal dont they). I do not mind the wizards ability to root the mob and blast it to shreds in seconds(send 2 mobs at him and see if he can even run and ull see he cant whereas a tank will almost always escape).<P>However i do mind a couple of things in this game and i would like to see them changed:<P>1) Give the tanks ability to solo the one level above green mobs at least. There really shouldnt be a need for a warrrior to sit on his arse for 2 RL hours waiting for a group that would need him. Get the melee classes something to do.<P>2) Give more importance to stat please ... i mean a caster who doubles his int/wis has twise the mana ... a warrior that doubles his stamina has an additional 200hp from 2300 to 2500 ... anyone can tell the difference in there<P>3) PETS .... EXCUSE ME IF I LET GO OF MY TEMPER HERE. My Paladin is a 37 level 40 days of play time spent in training his abilities to the maximum possible. I have spent all of my play time getting the things that make me great ... i can solo two blue mobs in LGuk anytime but HELL "%#%# ing HELL if a caster happens to spend a bit of mana and summon a pet i DO NOT stand a chance at defeating it. It is HUMILIATING to se this. I spent 94 hours camping the Ghoulbane endless hours aquiring the Ro armor pieces ... the BEBP and the rest of it suffering all the way spendidng thousands of plat to get me armor pieces that upped my performace for id say 10%(not counting Ghoulbane here) and ALL a caster has to do is go to the nearest guild and spend 50pp to buy a SPELL that gives him a more powerfull tank than i am. This is ludicorus. I mean i spent all that time all that sweat all those sleeples nights honong my skill improving my weapon arsenal and all a caster needs to do is summon a pet and go invis and im toast .... he needs no items no skills no ingenious tactics no NOTHING BUT 50pp of cash for a spell and i have NO i repeat NO chance to match his pet. I have been told that even tanks in FULL PLANE ARMOR and weilding God weapons lost agains pets alone ... I MEAN THAT IS BS. Do the pets get those items for the cost of spell included or what. I mean am i the only one who thinks this is wrong. I mean i spent all that time investing in my Paladin to be able to actually PROTECT casters and now i find out that I NEED to be protected with the pets. I mean pets get regen speed of twice the cloroplast hitting power more than a tank equipped with ANY weapon and can take WAAAY more punisment .. whats the next step making them smart? <P>There is also a couple of comments from Abashi that i cannot bear: <P>1) The most annoying one is " If u dont like the char play another one" while he in thhe same sentence says that ppl need to roleplay more. I mean i chose the Paladin NOT because i wanted to be uber powerfull ... i chose him because paladins are great heroes sacrificing themselvees for others good. If id wanted to rule the game id pick a mage or necro. ALL im asking here is give me a chance to actually be of use to such a class.<P>2) This matter is a dead horse ..... DO i need to talk about this one? I mean thousands of posts get to them every day all wantind something to be done and all they can say is we closed the matter. SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE MY D%$&.<P>3) We brought it up at the meeting and decided against it. Ok i give them some right here ... players shouldnt have all the power to decide about this game but since the players are WHY the game was made in the first place id say we DO have some right to be heard to and be able to influence the decisions. <P>4) This one relates to the above point. "Most ppl that send letters are naturally complaining and represent a small piece of the customer base" heres a suggestion ... when there is a burning issue make it so that when u run the game and the news start loading down a querry window opens and players HAVE to answer to a poll before u start the game .... this would only show once per account of course so ppl wouldnt complain about it being too bothersome ... i mean how bothersome can answering a question once a month be.. i really dont think ppl would abandon the game for it and Verant would get more and better feedback and most of all a feedback from all PPL not just those wh they call WHINERS. (ok most of the whiners really are whiners but some have reasonable suggestions)<P>I could write more of this but i really need some more evercrack and im off to play my pally again and try to get him to lvl 38 and maybe just maybe get the Thick Banded Belt that would up my performance another 0.5%<P><BR>Banelion 37 Paladin on Quellious<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000049&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000565&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000565&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
