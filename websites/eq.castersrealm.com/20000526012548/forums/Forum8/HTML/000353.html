</FONT><HR>I am not a person who is asking anyone to be nerfed.  Personally i think if the programmers made one class too powerful in their opinion then they shouldn't be able to take that power away.  Find another alternative.  I just wanted to get that out of the way, once again "I do not want to see Necros nerfed and i think it sucks that you guys have been".  However, I am active on the mage forum and have seen many necros complaining that mages should be nerfed.  <P>I feel that both mages and necros are a very viable, soloing class.  Mages have strong pets, perhaps now stronger then necro pets since they have been nerfed (i am not stating this as fact because i have done no tests).  Mages also have terrific dd spells.  This equals out to a class that can solo well and kill stuff fast, all in all a very powerful class.<P>Now necros.  (please do not take everything i say as fact because i have never played a necro.  some of my rl friends are necros and i have fought with many, but have never played one)  Necromancers can summon up very strong pets.  They have terrific dots, the best in the game.  They also have direct damage spells, i think the best does in the 500's???  Not sure though.  You guys are a very flexible class, having many useful spells such as a snare line, fear, root, magic skin, charm undead, self clarity (liche form), lifetap spells, brief invulnerability, and feign death.  In my opinion Necros are the best soloing class in the game.  They can solo a room better than anyone else.<P>Many necros complain that magicians are too powerful, we can nuke hard and we have strong pets.  However, this is almost the extent of our abilities.  True we can summon stuff, which i like very much, but is lacking in many areas.  We have rain spells, which do not work very well at all.  And our escape spells are gate.  When a mage solos (without sow) he gets the mob on his pet.  Nukes the mob, heal pet, nuke the mob, ect.  If our pet dies and we cannot outrun the mob we are dead.  We can try to gate but thats a very long casting time when every blow the mob lands is full damage.  We cannot lifetap to get health back, have no magic skin, no invuln shield, no feign death.<P>The mages spellbook is probably one of the most boring out there.  I truly love my class but to tell you the truth i do one thing my entire life.  "pet kill"  nuke.  Thats it.<P>It sucks that your pets were nerfed.  But in all honesty dont you think they were too powerful?  I have many times seen a 49 necro pet solo a 50 warrior, in all his plane armor.  With fine steel daggers they were insane, and if they lost duals to mage pets it is only because of our damage shields, your pets just killed themselves.<P>When i read a post from a Necro stating that mages should be nerfed, i wanna ask them How?  Will you nerf our direct damage? (the only power we have besides our pets)  Or will you nerf our pets? (once again making necro pets so much more powerful then ours) You cannot take away escape spells, because we have none.<P>I want to say again that i think it sucks that you guys were nerfed (i wanna state this alot because i'm gonna get burned for this post no matter what i say).<P>But even after all the nerfs Verant has screwed you with, You guys are still the most powerful class in the game.  You are the best soloers.  Plus you have a spellbook so much more unique and interesting then the mages.  You have many many skills that can save your life.<P>Mages are not your enemies, most of us do not want to see you nerfed.  We dont want your power taken away and we do not want alot more power givin to us.  But when I hear necros complain i just don't see why.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000353.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General&TopicSubject=Necro+vs+Mages">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<BR>Honestly, I apologize on behalf of some of my fellow Necros, If they have gone to the Mage board demanding Mages be Nerfed.<P>Quite Frankly, The Nerf affected Necros levels 39+.Although at first I was up in arms about the Nerf, but after a period of readjustment, the Necro Pet is still a force to reckon with. WIth a slight change in tactics and strategy, the Nerf turned out to be minimal at Best.<P>Given The Necros versatile line of spells, I am still able to fight MOB's that most wouldnt even consider. Even in times of Emergency, The Necromancer still has the highest potential for survival.SO All in ALL , I have a renewed faith that the Necro class is still as effective as ever.<P>The Biggest problem I have so far is not being able to cast that many DOTs any more, with Cascading Darkness 800 dot, Ignite Blood 1200 dot,Asystole 700 Dot, Bond of Death 800 dot and one mean 49 Pet , not much is staying alive very long.<P>As a matter of fact, In a Planes run Last Weekend, The effectiveness of the Necro Pet was Fantastic. During a botched pull (3 Gorgons and a Phantasm) the only 2 Team Members left standing were 2 Necros, unfortunately my Team Member didnt get Feign Death off in time. Alas I managed to escape as my Loyal Pet sacrificed itself to let its Master live.<P>So I am glad the Mage Pet has been enhanced, as a matter of fact, we could have used your pet that Day.LOL...Be Well<P>Rulor X'Mortis<BR>50th Lord of Necromancy<BR>Solusek Ro<BR>Guild Magnus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000353.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General&TopicSubject=Necro+vs+Mages">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well, im not for nerfing anyone or anything, especially, especially not necros! I play one on rare occasion(love the class, but im too lazy to get to 20 again and I cant respect myself as a gnome, hehe) and my main is a 30 magician, as a mage a necro has to be my single favorite partner. between the 2 pets, the DD and DoT's there is not much that can withstand an appropriate leveld mage necro combo in the out of doors. I think that the pet delay nerf was almost good in that there was one thing to come out of it, my friend with a slower comp no longer worries about LD from hitspam, hehe =P. I think that in all honesty, there are many many people in EQ that are just dumb. just like in real life, many many dumb people. and they make any class look bad if theres a bandwagon to jump on. there was a necros are gods bandwagon, ended in nerfs, and the mages are still feeling the necro anti mage bandwagon. I think that most of the intelligent posters just ignore the spam posts, so to speak. there are very many talented and apssionate individuals, from the mage boards I site rhionslingo, gween, augusten. the necro boards Rulor, you come to mind. all in all, I beleive that most classes have some degree of solo potential if properly equipped or choosing the right fights. saw a warrior, level 32, doing millers in front of SFG, he was soloing, and probably satisfied with XP. necros are gods in undead dungeons, and suffer quite a bit from lack of DD in non undead areas. mages are not ultra gods anywhere, but there is hardly a situation a mage cant put mana to use. be it undead or not, an HP sack pet, the ability to cheaply resumon, heal, damage sheild the pet, and nuke strongly, at appropriate times, makes an intelligently played mage a truly beautiful thing, like a necro. but any numbskull can start a necro and screw up bigtime, and move away from the class, ive seen dumb mages go quite high sitting in a group and pet / nuking. necros really are the kings of not dieing though, FD rocks FD rocks FD rocks... (/cakcle) magicians have not much to do in a bad situation, decide early, get out, etc. in closing(quit clapping) ide like to say that the intelligent necro players are hardly affected by the nerf, and teh legion of not so intelligent necros are still mad because non adjusted tacctics are failing. as for mage pets getting duel weild, I dont think there is anything wrong with that, mage pets do about the same per hit as a encro, and up to this point, only fought(sp?) with one hand. besides, we still have to do everything strait fighting, kiting just doesnt work too well for mages. welp, im done for the time being, ive vaguely alluded to my point, which is better than I hoped for at 5AM. im done =P(I said quit cheering damn you)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000353.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=General&TopicSubject=Necro+vs+Mages">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Heh kind of funny the pet nerf really didn't affect soloing at all, at least if you know how to play your class. And then it only affects people levels 39+. The problem I have with it is that the pet was what made us real useful in groups. If anyting it affected grouping more then soloing. Dots just take to long to be effective in a group unfortunatly.

</FONT><HR>Naraz, I must say I really can't understand people like you. Nerf other classes, make necros better? First of all, if you think druids are good, go play one. There is no class that deals out the ammount of damage/mana like a necro does. What happens when too many whiners like you start screaming for nerfs?
