</FONT><HR>Caster's and melees are not really all that unbalanced. A good group needs melees, just as much or maybe even more than it needs casters. You can compare casters and melee ablilties in soloing as much as you want but not only is that not what the game is based upon, but it's boring as hell too. You can also start comparing PC melees and caster pets, some are saying that they can be out preformed by a pet summoned by and equal level caster, after the weapon/speed downgrade I don't see how that's true, the pet's only hit for a max of 55 and I KNOW that melees are able to hit hard than that. Not to mention the fact that pets are dumber than bricks. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000075&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Binding-<BR>        The way I figure it is if verant really wanted to fix the problem of meele binds they would either make a potion of binding (they have a gate potion so why the hell not, Shamans could make it for all I care)<P>Throwing/Archery-<BR>        As I see it, one of the main factors (besides having pets) that contributes to a casters ability to solo so well and not take a large amount of dmg are there abilities of dealing there damage from a distance, I know meele characters are supposed to fight in a "in your face" style, but since armour is only helpful to an extent in the battle why not upgrade archery and throwing? A meele character should be able to fall somewhat out of harms way for a period of time, he shouldn't be out there all the time getting the snot kicked out of him when the caster behind him is sitting on his butt recharging his mana to cast some more, and I figure since you seem to have made casters and meele characters so co-dependant you would want to keep people interested in playing a meele (which by the way in my opinion is not the way it is at this point).<P>and last but not least.......<P>Pets-<BR>     I don't know why I even bother posting this considering there is no chance of anything like this being implemented, but heres my theory on how to clean up some issues with pets, I propose that there be a "feedback" to the casters, from the damage done to there pets. What I mean by feedback is that when dmg is dealt to the casters pet he take a fraction of the hit himself, thus making it so that the weeny casters can't just cast and ditch there pets when the fight goes bad (ie: the mob seems a bit too powerful for the caster in question so he suicides Mr. Elemental or what-ever and runs away while the mob is distracted by the pet).<P>well thats about it, this was your sneak peek at my insanity......<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000076&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well, I currently have a 50 shaman, 41 warrior, 40 paladin.  I've played all of them extensively in groups and solo.  I am sort of on the fence on this issue.  Imagine what EQ would be like if EVERYONE was able to solo.  A dozen level 50s would be able to camp everything in lower guk.  I think the overcrowding issue would magnify.<P>There are also advantages to being in a group.  You can handle multiple pulls with less risk.  There is less downtime, so the number of kills would balance out the the experience for the single kill when soloing.<P>By far, the shaman I have is the most powerful solo, disregarding level (I was soloing pairs of minos in lower guk at level 35, my 41 warrior still can barely solo one).<BR>Take this shaman to a dragon raid or planes raid and he is pretty much a buff machine with minimal damage potential.<P>What I'm saying is that there are pros and cons to both sides.  If tanks were buffed up to the soloing capabilities of casters, there would be a lot few casters going on big raids.  Imagine a group of 4 upgraded warriors with a cleric or 2, or an optional enchanter.  Who the heck would want magicians or wizards in a group anymore?<P>I've played lots of classes to a respectable level and I'd say each one has it's strengths and weaknesses.  There could be some things done, I don't think everything is balanced as far as classes go, but the discrepancy isn't as great as most people perceive in my opinion.<P>BF - Innoruuk server<BR>50 barb shaman<BR>41 ogre warrior<BR>40 half elf paladin<BR>26 gnome magician<BR>21 half elf bard<BR>12 halfling druid<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000078&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I want to hear some answers from someone other than Abashi, all of his answers are quite ambiguous(and purposfully so).<BR>The reason this is all going nowhere is because things like no meelee binding anywhere are there for a reason - to keep you playing longer. Is it a balanced game? Of course not, very unbalanced in a few areas, but everything that goes in has to be weighed against income. Would it make more sense for melee's to have soloing abilities within reasonable range of casters? Sure, but some people might reach 50 faster, and quit playing. You think losing exp. when you die, or making gods/dragons more powerful in every patch is to make the game more challenging? It is, but not for the benefit of a better gaming experience, its so you'll play longer.<BR>People need to think about it, and realize that being a monthly subscriber game, EQ was designed from the ground up to keep you playing, thus providing more income.<BR>(logically)Also it's no coincidence that the<BR>most pandered to classes are the ones with the highest subscriber base, thats also a logical method of doing things. Things then<BR>have to be weighed against cost of implementing them - programmers don't work for free. Everything is just a matter of priorities, and game balance is just not at the top of the list. The "would be nice" list<BR>is a list of things they would probably add<BR>if it did'nt cost anything. An final example:<BR>rogues = low subscriber base = poison fix on back burner. Spell casting classes = higher<BR>subscriber base = tons of little tweaks and fixes for various spells, that are reasonably balanced, in every patch. In all the time  these little spell tweaks took to make, poison could have been fixed - but it <BR>wasn't - and by choice. Abashi, being verants spin doctor will hopefully be quick to shoot this post down with doublespeak and ambiguous terms - I would be interested to see his response.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000079&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>To Walil: If you are fighting in South Karana, bind in the Arena in lake Rathetear. Much closer to SK than qeynos or Highhold.<BR>To anyone complaining about walking past 40: Get to know some clerics and portalers. A paladin friend of mine has been bound in Greater Faydark for the last 5 levels or so to 50, since she either got resurected each time she died, or could get a ride from a wizard back to the fighting zones.<BR>Binding is not an issue in the higher levels, provided you made some friends in the lower levels.<BR>As to general balance: As a wizard, I feel that I have to do more damage than a warrior, and by far, since I cannot ake any. If warriors could do as much damage as wizards, then wizards would be out of a job. No need to take a weak caster if the tank can dish out damage and take it.<BR>Soloing is another matter. I did not solo since level 6 or so with my wizard, so I don't really care about soloing.<BR>As to pets: I think no pet should dish out more damage than a melee class of equal level as the pet caster.<P>Leona Firehead<BR>Wizard from Freeport, fennin Ro<BR>"Have spell, will travel."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000080&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR><BR> Shouldn't be able to do more damage than a similarly leveled melee? Then explain to me why you would need a melee at all? I'll just be a mage summon my rooting earth pet that does the same damage as a melee then damage shield and nuke. And don't even get me started on necros.  Pets are the truly inbalanced thing as I see it, the summons should NOT be based on mobs they should be based on pcs. You summon your level 50 necro pet you get a level 35 monk with no feign.  Now pet classes would whine but but but my pet will get smooshed by anything that would give me xp!

</FONT><HR>When I first thought to reply here, I figured "Hey, screw Abashi's opinions. Buff up the tanks a little!"<P>Then I got here, and saw a thread that's been going on since the beginning of time: Make warriors soloers.<P>You think it's the greatest thing in the world soloing? It's not. I can get to level 50 faster than you, and I can solo a SINGLE, RISKLESS mob better than you.<P>Soloing requires some form of direct damage (or a pet) and some form of healing/damage avoidance (or a pet.) Warriors have neither really, so they're not good soloers. In order to fix this (upcoming sarcasm) I propose the following:<P>1. Bind Wound now works faster, better, and costs mana. Warriors have a mana bar of course.<P>2. Attacks now do roughly quadrouple damage, and can be done with equal damage from bows. They cost roughly a bubble of mana each to use. This of course will more or less permanently aggro a mob onto you, which fits in great with #3.<P>3. Warriors now have half their hitpoints, and can no longer have any decent armor.<P>There you go, you're now great soloers. They're already in the game of course. We're called casters.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000082&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I actively play a rogue and a mage. I have a druid and a necro on the shelf.<P>The difference in power is AMAZING. The necro overpowers all the others classes with a druid coming in a close second. My mage is signifigantly less powerful than my necro or druid, but all three are an order of magnitude more powerful than my rogue. <P>- Casters can solo yellows for more exp per kill<P>- Casters can attack higher level mobs than an equal level melee for more exp per kill either grouped or solo<P>- Casters don't die nearly as often as melee and recover from death quicker (gate/bind). Not dying is more important at higher levels where you lose so much exp per death<P>- Casters are effective naked and can buy spells, melee has to camp equipment and is ineffetive naked. <P>I play a rogue part time while my friends catch up in level to my mage (hint: we started at the same time). I would NEVER play melee as my primary character and will probably quit my rogue once he needs to travel simply because he cannot bind in convenient locations. <P>Even amoung melee classes there is little balance. Rogues cannot solo at all because they need a tank AND a healer to use their backstab. Pickpocket exludes them from groups (and now can get you banned!). But among melee only monks and rogues do enough damage fast enough to be even marginally useful in a group with casters. Warriors are nothing more than manasinks. <P>The reality is that melee is NOT needed in this game. They deal damage too slowly; they require to much mana to support; they take too long to recover from deaths. Mage and necro pets deal and absorb damage just as well and don't need a healer/buffer.<P>If you look at how the game is played, the ONLY role for melee is pulling, but in most cases groups camp a site and are prefectly capable of pulling with spells back to the waiting pets and DD mavens.<P>The IDEAL group? 2 mages, 1 necro, 1 enchanter, 1 druid and 1 bard.  Gives you massive DD, 3.5 tanks, mana regen, evac, crowd control, buffs and all the healing that low hp casters require. Indoors this group rocks, but outdoors and it is even better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000083&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I saw an interesting point in an earlier post: casters can bind anywhere AND they can bind. <P>This needs to be reversed. Casters need to bind in cities AND bind, but melee needs to be able to be bound anywhere. After all melee is the class that has to RUN BACK NAKED AND HELPLESS after a death. Casters are 95% effective naked (well mages are 25% effective since they can't summon pet or root)<P>The frail casters need to be the one's dependent on towns, not melee. Yet with summon food/water, healing, gate/bind, and other utility spells casters really only need to go to town for spells. Melee has to BUY food, water, potions, etc. all in a city. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000084&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I keep pretty steady logs for my warrior since the capability became available, and along with it, the programs to analyze those logs and spit out cold, hard numbers. And boy are they cold and hard.<P>Here are some actual figures for you:<BR>Level 40 warrior (Dual Wielding a Ykesha and Silvery War Axe)<P>Average hit to miss ratio: 55%<BR>Average damage dealt: 15<P>Here's a close up of one fight in particular:<BR>Damage taken by me: 447<BR>Damage inflicted by me: 394<P>Mana used by 44th level druid to heal me:<BR>One Greater Heal (270 HP): 150 mana<BR>One Chloroplast (10/tick regen): 200 mana<P>Mana cost for one Drifting Death (720 pt DoT): 200 mana<P>Mana efficiency of Drifting Death: 360%<BR>Mana efficiency of healing a warrior: 112%<P>Basically, the druid could have cast that DoT 3 times for the amount I "bogged down" the group. If he wanted to solo, even granted the reduced DoT damage for kiting, that still comes out about even and he gets all the XP.<P>This example is brought to you courtesy of last night's expedition to Spectre Island, which would not even have been possible for me save for the druid's harmony pulling.<P>Honestly, I feel weak and useless. My class takes no intelligence or skill to play. (I swear to you, a former guildmate of mine had a four year-old son who played a warrior.)<P>I have endless trouble finding a group. I've sat for over an hour in Sol B and Lower Guk, shouting my brains out to no avail. A few times I've tried to start a group by corralling my fellow group shouter-seekers and you know what I hear? "Sorry, I won't join a group that doesn't have a healer."<P>Caster friends of mine try to cheer me up by telling me that they really need tanks for dragon raids. When I ask why, they say that they need someone to take the hits while they cast. So basically they need me to die... and of course since I'll be bound in Halas or Freeport, I probably won't make it back before the fight is over.<P>Verant obviously has the capability to run a log-in poll. Why the hell don't they use it? If I were them I'd have a new question up every week. Reading the message boards is  only looking at a small fraction of the EQ population that posts. And very few people are going to post just to say "It's all fine and good." Use the log-in polls to their full advantage, get answers from a majority of the customers and act on it.<P>I really, really wish there had been a little text box that popped up at character creation that said "Warning! If you continue with this class you won't make any meaningful progress without a healer past the first ten levels!" Geez, at least they weren't kidding about the "low difficulty" part.<P>If it didn't mean giving up 30+ hours of played time, countless time and money sunk into trade skills, and all my similar-level friends and guildmates, I certainly would take Gordon's thoughtful suggestion to play another class. And this time I would damn well be a necro.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000085&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>The tanks are seriously fine.  Giving one class the ability to bind tanks anywhere but dungeons would be nice... but it isn't going to happen.<P>Yes, most tanks will get themselves smacked up by a green mob, at least once they hit the mid to high 40's.  (in the 30's, I've fought blues and lost under 100 hp).<P>Pets, though, are another matter.  When Verant ran its pet vs warrior tests, they did them against unarmed pets... in short, ones that weren't dual wielding.  This was also prior to the summoning focuses added to the game.  Pet healing is too fast.  It should suck up the casters mana.  That way, the AC of a human tank would mean something.  While pet classes would no doubt hate it (I know I wouldn't be too happy) the overall change would be for the better.  Just be sure that each pet class has the ability to heal their pets.  Currently, most pets will outdamage warriors.  They've got more hp's.  They've got a built in regen factor that's just huge.  The only areas they lack in are taunting (but they do good enough, ac (no big deal, each comes with a caster to kill things, has got the hp to make up for it), and intelligence (no big deal for a proper group of casters).<P>Will it get changed though?  I doubt it.  No doubt the whole pet vs tank issue was considered a "dead horse" long ago, after the idiotic tests... and they won't go back to look at it now.<P>On the bright side, maybe the new 51+ abilities in Krunark will make tanks shine... they're supposed to get abilities that "make the casters jealous"...  Of course, the level 51+ necro and mage pet spells will probably cast ice comet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000086&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Just a thought. Why not introduce a line of spells to the game specifically designed to increase the damage a melee character does? Enchanters have wanted to be able to enchant weapons since the beginning of the game. I believe that the game engine does not support enchanting weapons, but how about a buff that is cast on a melee that acts as a damage amplifier? OR, perhaps cast on a mob, that amplifies the damage done by anyone via melee? Sort of a reverse damage shield kind of thing. Then, melee gets a dmg booster in general, and enchanters get to do more than deal crack. <P>Just a thought.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000091&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Okay, look this is what i think: Yes the melee classes may be getting screwed in the end but think about all us casters. We give up all that good power at the beggining of the game. You know damn well that a level 1 tank could womp on a level 1 caster. But at lvl 50 the casters are supreme. It is very hard for a caster to become more powerful than tanks, but hey it happens. That is my argument against every melee that complains that casters are stronger. Its all about equality, if your a tank you chose to be powerful at the beggining, if your a caster you chose to be weak at the beggining.

</FONT><HR>Ok, that's the most ridiculous argument I've ever heard.  A level 1 melee can beat a level 1 caster?  That lasts what, 3 levels? Once the casters get past the 4 damage nuke stage they begin gaining power significantly from there on out.  <P>Melee is balanced in the sense that they can be useful in a group. That doesn't mean that they will ever be the most useful player in a group, or be able to do anything on their own, but Verant seems to be fine with this. Verant also throws the "play something else if you don't like it" argument in our face whenever we make a point.  The time invested in a character at higher levels is not something that you can just throw away and try again. <P>Melee classes are needed in a group. However, a melee character in a group without a full regiment of casters to make them worthwhile is worthless.  A warrior can barely tank a mob that their party gets experience for without being severely injured afterward.  Casters have ways to fight without getting hurt, they just use mana. Mana regenerates faster than hitpoints so a caster becomes much more versatile and useful to a party.  <P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>We don't wish to have people standing back in this game and plugging away at critters, doing as much damage as melee, yet without significant risk, and where the only balancing factor is cash.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Hello?

Does this not allow a caster to stand back and "plug away at critters?" What is a wizard?

Casters have dozens of options beyond running up and attacking, thus making them more powerful than a melee class will ever hope to be.<P>One more point, all classes need to be balanced throughout the game.  Saying that a warrior at level one is stronger than a caster justifies them being a fraction as effective as a caster for the rest of the levels is silly.<P>Quaid Brown,<BR>41st monk, Rodcet</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000093&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Actually, a tank with gear (as in a twinked tank) can easily solo well into the 30's... and will outlevel a caster until well into the 20's.  After a certain point, mobs get more powerful faster then tanks do.  At this point, the ability to avoid damage becomes more crucial.  So yes, then casters have an advantage.  However, that doesn't mean classes are unbalanced.  It swings both ways...<P>If the damage can't be avoided, who would you rather be?  A warrior or an int based caster?  I play both.  I had my warrior geared up for high AC and HP long before it became the norm.  Why did I do so?  Because I love the fact that my warrior can take hits and live.  I've primary tanked the AoF with only 3 90 points heals... 270 points of healing with me taking the beating from the AoF for 90% of the fight (didn't take the HT though)... and this when I was in my low 30's.  The casters couldn't cast because of a few other mobs that wandered in.  Anyone but a warrior would have crumpled and died.  My warrior lived.  That's the power of the melee classes.  The ability to take a pounding.  Yes, you can't go at it alone against any but light blues.  Yes, pets are nuts.  But in a balanced group, tanks can fight non-stop like no casters can.  It's all plus and minus.  Short fight goes to caster.  Long fight (with healing of course) advantage is to tanks.  Chance of surviving one mob... advantage caster, chance of surviving multiple mobs beating on you, advantage tank.  Used to take my enchanter into Cazic... in the CY, if a train, I'd be dead before I reached the doors.  My warrior would routinely make it out from further in, taking the time to turn the attention of as many mobs as possible onto himself and off the casters (basically always one of the last ones out), and he'd make it out.  Again and again and again.  The only times I didn't is when I'd get stuck (lizards blocking the doorway leading to TR1, the spiraling swim up from the SG).<P>I play both caster and tank.  I play each for different reasons.  I play my enchanter because I love the class, but only if I trust those I'm with... and I'm the first to die if things go wrong.  I play my warrior because I love the class.  I take him anywhere, will tank anything.  If I die, I'm the only one to die (barring idiot casters that run around screaming "get it off me, get it off me!")... but most of the time I won't.  I'll make it out with a half or a quarter of a bub of hp.  And that's with mobs beating on me the whole way.<P>From the beginning, with my warrior, I accepted that I wouldn't be solo'ing at higher levels.  I wanted some ability to do so though, so I did take troll to reduce healing time.  And, yah, I've partied in groups with no casters... relying either on hybrid healing spells or natural healing/spreading damage around.<P>I see others commenting here too, about rogues being worthless (not true, they do damage right up there with monks).  About wizards solo'ing with root (high level nukes break high level root spells pretty much every time).  I see comments about how high level warriors can't solo greens without getting clobbered (my guess is you have to be 45+ to be here... though I'm pretty sure I'll be solo'ing xp giving blues at 42 still).  A warrior in my guild (50th) can and does solo HG's.  Of course, he's got all top of the line gear... but then, a tank's power is so gear dependent.<P>Is everything perfect?  No.  I wouldn't mind seeing healing kicked up another point at 40... if only for tanks.  I wouldn't mind seeing a caster class get a bind II that will let them bind anyone anywhere but in dungeons.  I wouldn't mind some way to make it easier to find groups.  But overall the balance is there.  Don't forget that against some mobs, all us casters can do is help the tanks.<P>Axterix En'Obelix, sometime solo'ing, sometime partying, sometime dieing level 47 enchanter<BR>Teerog T'rog, sometime solo'ing, sometime partying, never dieing Level 35 Barsher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000098&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I wanted to state a word or two concerning the perception of "balance" between melee and caster classes.  Not too long ago, I was<BR>playing a 13th level ranger (on the Nameless)<BR>.  I was in SRo (a dangerous place for me)<BR>and I watched as a spellcaster (whom I did<BR>a /who on to discover that he was two levels<BR>LOWER than me) sent his pet to attack a<BR>monster that could easily have killed me --<BR>if I recall correctly, it conned yellow to<BR>me.  While his pet kept the monster occupied,<BR>the caster nuked it with spells.  I didn't<BR>time the combat, but it was relatively brief.<P>I haven't played a caster, so I speak from<BR>a position of ignorance, but I fail to see<BR>how the caster's position and my Ranger's<BR>are balanced.  As far as I could tell, the<BR>risk to the caster's life was minimal -- he<BR>risked his pet's life, and he also lost mana<BR>to cast spells, but the exp/treasure gain<BR>more than compensates for this.<P>In my Ranger's situation, I can't simply solo<BR>the monster in melee.  I might be able to <BR>cast 'Snare' so that I could kite him for a<BR>bit, and that helps, but not nearly enough.<BR>He will still catch me and kill me when the<BR>snare wears off.<P>So I was lucky this time -- I was able to<BR>zone out and escape.  I've got maybe a bubble<BR>of health left, I've shot 15-20 arrows (which<BR>cost money, and I can't go back and pick up<BR>off the ground).  I might have gained a few<BR>skill points, but that's all.  The caster,<BR>meanwhile, is recovering his lost mana, and his pet is presumably recovering lost HP.<BR>In his case, though, he killed it and gained<BR>exp/treasure and whatever skill increases<BR>may have accrued.<P>My conclusion from this (given my limited<BR>information) is that it is absurd to claim<BR>that this comparison can be called in any way<BR>"balanced".<P>I like my ranger, and will continue to enjoy<BR>playing him.  But given the information I<BR>have, there is no way this is balanced.<P>I'm not hoping for an upgrade, a nerf, a<BR>patch, or anything else.  I just wanted to <BR>express my feeling on the matter and see if<BR>anyone else felt the same way.<P>Thanks for listening  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>Menelvir<BR>15th season Ranger - The Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000099&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000565&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000565&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
