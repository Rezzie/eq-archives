Maybe teleport towers could be binding areas, or if the programming is set up such that a zone is all-or-nothing -- i.e. bind everywhere or nowhere -- then make a couple small zones where people can be bound... I would recommend a neutral bind point every few zones, so that people don't have to run through more than 3 zones to get to their corpse...that would help spread the load.

</FONT><HR>I play two mid 20s lvl characters, a Magician, and a Monk. I love playing both of these characters, but I must say, that when it comes to dying, the monk dies regularly, the mage NEVER dies if I play carefully...<P>The other glaringly obvious thing is that I started the Monk the day EQ was released to get him to mid 20 levels, without ever power levelling.. a total /played time of around 16 days...<P>I didnt power level the mage either, but she has a /played time of around 8 days, and is now two levels higher than the monk.<P>There is absolutely no question in my mind, that the Mage is far more capable of accumulating experience over time than the Monk.<P>But I acknowledge, that a key part of this is that the monk is useless on his own, whereas the mage can easily and without risk still solo yellow mobs, at lvl 26.<P>The monk struggles with easy blues....<P><BR>Phoenix<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000102&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

Most casters can wipe floor with Hermit at 23. In fact, my Necro made 20-24 levels on Hermit killing him non-stop, spawn after spawn. I doubt your pally can kill Hermit each 3 min unless he is ungodly twinked. And i doubt how  can pally solo Hermit at 21 lvl at all.<P>And about mobs difference. Yes, they are different, there is caster-friendly mobs ( treants for example ) but there is no melee-friendly mobs. Overall most casters are much easier to level( save wizzie and cleric ), much more powerful then melee( save wizzie and cleric again ) and much more fun to play( save wizzie and cleric third time ).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000103&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I am a 41st level monk on Rodcet Nife and I've been in many a battle, so I feel I am well experienced in the way of Monkly combat and have learned some of the more advanced strategies not seen at lower levels. After playing for so long, I really know all the tricks inside and out, so I'll post them here for you to learn from.<P>Ok, one of the most common situations you're going to run into is when you are fighting a monster one on one. What I like to do in this situation is punch it a whole bunch until it dies, and then if one of his friends come, I punch him too, until he dies. Sometimes, when I'm fighting something fairly weak, I like to go up to it and punch it a bunch. Then if I go up against something tougher, I go up and punch it. At times, you may find yourself up against 2 or more things at once. Now this is a very advanced strategy in terms of melee combat, so pay attention. First you have to choose one of the multiple monsters. This can often be difficult since when you're fighting them they turn into this meshed ball of monster, all 3 or 4 of them occupying exactly the same space and it is nearly impossible to select any of them but the one closest to you. So instead of making a rational decision on which to fight, I like to hit the closest npc button and punch that one a bunch.<P>Now, here are some tricks that I've picked up along the way. Make sure that you're quad attacking instead of only once per round. You get double attack at level 15 and dual wield at level 1.  Most monks don't make very good use of these skills until higher levels and I'm not really sure why. If you're following your advanced strategy and punching the monster, and your life seems to be going to run out before the monster's is (using advanced mathematics you can extrapolate your and the monster's time of death and make your decision based on that) then it might be a good idea to run. Usually run to the zone, guards or other players and yell for help. You'd probably be better off to run to a caster, since they can either heal you or cast one of their numerous spells (they are really quite versatile, unlike us lowly melee classes). Some good phrases to get help with could be "HL:JP ME" or "HLp" since it is hard to run and type at the same time. You could make a macro for this, something like "HELP ME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HELP ME I RAN UP AND PUNCHED IT LIKE I ALWAYS DO AND I"M LOSING!". Monks also have feign death which comes in incredibly handy, since the running up and punching the baddy a bunch doesnt always work, you can feign death instead of running for help. Mend comes in handy as well, you can wait for your life to get down a couple bars and click the mend button and your life goes up some, that way you can continue your advanced 'click auto attack and tap your special move every few seconds strategy'. I feel really sorry for warriors, because all the strategy that I can think of for them is run up and slash the baddies a bunch. Maybe they're better at running or something than monks, there must be some balance. <P>Now young meleers, this may sound like I'm trying to say playing a melee class is boring! Not so! Not only do you get to use the above strategy (its really only one<BR>strategy isnt it? run up and punch?) you get to SEE high NUMBERS when you punch! Thats right, you do more damage and boy, that sure is fun, doing more damage than a caster in melee, especially since melee is so much FUN, you click that ol' auto attack button and whew boy! watch the fun begin. And its also<BR>more fun because you have more hitpoints, and more armor class. Its even MORE fun to see those monsters miss, oh man, I get excited just thinking about it, seeing all those monster misses, or better yet being blocked or dodged by me, and high damage numbers when I attack. What fun! Its even more fun since its pretty much hands off, I get to just sit here and click my dragon punch every few seconds and watch the fun scroll by, and prepare for my advanced run like a girl(sorry Moogie) strategy if things get bad.<P>Ok, now some of you may have detected a hint of SARCASM in there, if so, good work, you've just been promoted to Master of the Obvious. Anyone that has played a melee class knows that it is BORING after a while. I mean, I've always played a melee class, I like the idea behind them, and it was ok, I was having fun,<BR>right? Then Verant deleted my little Quaid, and I was forced to try out a caster class. Good lord! I was having fun (fun!) at first level! I was a cleric, not only could I<BR>SMACK things, but I could also do 2 OTHER THINGS! I could A) cast my heal spell or B) buff myself with courage. What fun! 3 THINGS to do in combat. The options were endless, I could smack, heal, buff, I could buff, heal smack, I could smack, smack smack, heal. I mean, wow, I had OPTIONS here. Then I went and got more spells and my options were increasing factorially. I mean, that may not sound like much, but jesus, I was a meleer and you do nothing but attack a monster and wait. I propose that Verant give us SOMETHING to do while we fight. Now this may be some rampant game redesigning to make melee different, or maybe tetris on a sidebar to keep us entertained while fighting. What I do suggest is that we have more moves in combat, maybe they wont have a real huge effect on outcomes but at least we'd have some options. I mean, what if I could do a choke hold, that does damage over time and acts as root, and uses my stamina the longer I hold it. How about being able to aim for their weak spot, like try to punch them right in the eye, gut or groin (only effective vs male npcs of course) and doing increased damage if I succeed, at the risk of doing less damage. Why not? I mean, its already boring as hell. Now sure, there may be more to melee strats, like CHOOSING which one of those monsters you want to fight first, or if one is attacking your caster switch to that one and try to get him to attack you. But it really boils down to that there arent many options for you in melee combat, unless you're very creative, and then caster classes have the exact same options plus many more. Just food for thought guys, I know I'm getting kind of bummed playing my monk, as powerful as I may be and as many HIGH numbers I get to PUNCH for<P>(ooh, the thought of it makes me want to go play right now!) Tell me your thoughts, thanks for reading my looong post. Later<P>Quaid Brown<BR>41st level PUNCHER, Rodcet Nife<P>PS Before you flame me, I know that pets aren't as useful as a melee class because: 1) A pet can't think and doesn't listen to the caster always (not that a melee class does either, I'm almost as effective afk as I am at the keyboard). <BR>2) I know they don't make quite as good a tank as a melee, and it's perfectly reasonable for a caster to have a pet that is comparable to a melee class in most ways in his pocket. *rolls eyes*<BR>3) Meleers are way more useful to a group when fighting more than one mob at a time. We all know how common it is for a group to say "Screw the lull spell, pull em all! We gots a WARRIOR!" *the casters all nod gravely* "Because the warrior's an intelligent human being and not a computer simulacrum like that worthless pet"  <BR>4) Melees are better at taunting than pets are. Any wizard knows that they are the masters of damage in a short amount of time as Verant so recently announced and when they take advantage of this ability and nuke the mob til they're oom the friendly warrior has no problem getting that pesky mob to stop smacking the wizzy with a taunt and a kick or 2.<P>OK, I could go on and on and on and on and on X 10^45 and on about this but I'll stop now. I think I'll go invest another 45 days on a different class as Abashi so wisely suggests to anyone who makes a valid point.

</FONT><HR>Hello everyone,<BR>I am Yamawatta (level 50 warrior) bert <BR>server.<P>Well what was it they said?  We changed sk's and pallys because there class had some obvious balance issue problems?  <P>Ok, well i would like to know what is balanced about a level 50 warrior not being able to kill a green sand giant, but wait, here comes just about any other non mellee class that can.  Oh, and they are doing it at level 40!!<P>Ummm, what's not obvious there?  Someone have to much to drink before reviewing this issue?<P>My point here is, mellee class needs work, there is no ignoring it.  If it's ignored, well then the class will slowly fade out and not be played.  How do i know this?  Well, i'll tell you how.  I now have a level 43 druid.  His name is Yatsuna.  Wow and he is great.  I can a do little tanking when i have too, and well, i can root if i have too, oh man, and i love snare.  With my warrior all i could do was set back and wait for the mob to pull all his buddys and come back and cream me.  Oh gosh, and now i can blast the snot out of them!! and actually do some damage to them!!  wooohooo  no more misses for me!!<P>Ok, i know tanks are nice to have in a group, this is a given!!.  But here is the point.  Are you the one playing the warrior or the caster sitting there smileing and happy cause he's got a shield in front of him?<P>#1 If i hit as much as i missed it might help me feel like i can maybe be of more use then being beat on.  and i might actually win a fight with a low blue in a solo!<P>#2 if i could hit for at least half damage if i'm gonna hit instead of 2 points, again i might feel like i'm getting something done.  and i might actually win a fight with a low blue in a solo!<P>#3 wow, if i could just hit as hard as that mob does at a lesser level, again same statement.<P>Wake up Varant please!  you have a lot of unhappy customers here that are going to jet off to the newest game that comes out because they feel like you do not care what the problems in the game are, just about the money.  <P>Example:  Ultima Online.  <BR>wow they finally started fixing things when they lost about 80% of there customers!<P>I welcome any gm to join me in the game to let me show him first hand the problems with mellee versus caster classes.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000108&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>5 mins to med,WOW.. Wish I were that fast.<P>Just for kicks last night I created a Gnome mage and a Wood Elf ranger, even though I allready have a lev 27 gnome mage and 17 WE ranger.

At lev 4 she could only just beat them. <P>Kinda made me sick really and amazing that a melee class(tank) is incapeable of holding there own. At lev 16 it doesnt seem to get any better the mob your dealing with has to be 4 levels below the ranger before its considered an even fight.<P>Tonight im gonna try a warrior see what happens,because realisticly rangers are only half-tracks instead of tanks<P>Off topic:<BR>When you have 2 computers you get to see allot more of whats going on than you do with only 1 pc. You cant trust what you see with the life bars, especially at levs 1-12,<BR>I was under the impression that 1 round =6 seconds and after 6 seconds you got an update. Thats not the case, the ranger will see the mob mostly dead at the update and mage will see full life at the update or vice versa. Things are not happening in real time.

</FONT><HR>This balance isssue has been going for a long time. Although ppl have difference view toward it, it seems that majority of the ppl agree that there is an UNBALANCE between melee and caster. From a gaming view, it is balanced because the ratio of caster to melee is about 5-1. Therefore, melee should "in theroy" find a place in group. However, this is more of a equilibrium achieved due to the "unbalance" between class. If melee and casters are wel balanced, we should see equal distribution. I played mud for 2 years in uni prior to EQ. I played both melee and caster. They are all powerful. There are a few things they do it "right" which verant didnt, these are:<BR>1. mob that are 5 lvl lower than u can "hardly" hit you. however you will have a hard time hitting mobs 3 lvl higher than you. their "a/c" really mean somthing!! casters-who tends to have less a/c, will then need a melee to tank.<BR>2. group bonus. this is a bonus not just to exp, but to attacking power when you are goruped. I am not sure if any1 ever noticed that when you grp, the amount of "hits" that "land on mob" doesnt add up? the mud i played have this "bonus" system in place which increase the melee/caster power by 20% and increase the hitting % by 25%. This then combat the prob of killing high lvl mobs-You need a gorup to do that.<P>The only difference between EQ and MuD is grphic. However, mud does a better job in balancing. From what i have heard, many ppl stay at EQ because there is no better alternative. when they do, they will leave for sure. I like EQ, i think it's a great game. However, if verant wants to keep its customer, it really has to learn to listen. Maybe it's the difference bewteen IT industry and retailer industry-retail industry listens!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000565.cgi&ReplyNum=000111&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Casters+v+Melee:+Is+there+Balance|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000565-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000565&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000565&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
