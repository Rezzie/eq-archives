</FONT><HR>Oh yea we got our Swift like the Wind spell at lvl49, and it really max our pet's attack speed to do some more dmg. But that is just an excuse for ignoring our pet, as they forgot the mana cost for this spell and the extremely SHORT duration of this buff.<BR>Beside our crowd control ability, we are worthless.  We are sux in solo.  Our DD spells are mana costed and doing little dmg compare to other caster types, our DOT spells, sux too, even with a little debuff effect, it takes long to actually kill a mob.<BR>And we really pay for our crowd control spells too, as an ENC, we r always the one who will die first, our charm line and mes line is quite a suicide spell.

</FONT><HR>I think what some people might be missing to all of this, is the fact that things are bad all around. Yes, the Enchanter class is just one of the many classes that Verant has "nerfed." It isn't the first time, and I'm sure it won't be the last.  But, that doesn't make us happy about it, and why should we accept it.  There are other classes out there that fall well below theso called balance of the game, many of us are aware of this fact. What all of this is mainly about..is the straw that broke the camels back, so to speak.<BR>I for one, don't use a pet. Not because I don't want to, but because I've died way too many times trying to use a pet. I think we've all heard well enough why, so I won't repeat.  I am different, however, in the fact that I could care less right now if Verant were to get rid of the Enchanters animation, in leiu of another few spells... or improvements to existing ones.  I'm not a high level enchanter, and I used my pet to get where I am, mainly because I can't find a good group to save my life!  I know how the younger enchanters feel..you NEED that pet to get you through the early levels.  Fine, so stop making a pet when we get charm. What I REALLY want to see improved is our charm spells, our EARLY charm spell..you know, the one you get at level 12.  I think a lot of the higher level enchanters forgot what hell it was to get anywhere.  People don't want to group with enchanters until you get clarity.  The pets suck...so make charm work!  I'd love to see a message before my charm breaks..not when it breaks, because that does absolutely no good to me, he's already on top of me killing me!  I'd also like to see our mez spells actually take hold after we tashan the stupid things. What is the point in lowering their magic resistence when all your spells just bounce off? And they are bouncing off of blues and greens! NOT YELLOWS OR REDS!  Does that make sense?? I really don't think so.<BR>But, as my husband says, who plays a magician, if you don't like it, don't cry about it, just switch classes.  I already have a ton of characters...and the other day I started a necro for the first time.  If they are already being switched to enchanter mode...why not go there? They get stackable DoT's, a nice pet even if it isn't the greatest, you can control it  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">  and other great things, too.  <BR>I'm not a person out to rid the world of necros, or any other class. I just really would like Verant, or someone to listen, and to see that we are all here saying about the same things.... so, surely there has to be a point to it? Maybe we are all right?  Then what??<P>My guess is that if enchanters, who are already a more complicated class to play, if you want to play them "right" will die out. To the people who don't think before they speak, and just spew out words such as"Verant's baby class"  "Stop whining" etc... play an enchanter.  They are fun, but mostly because they are a challenge. I don't think that ANYTHING anyone has said here is without merit.  The class is useful because what?? Everytime I hear someone say to shut up, you always throw out, don't complain! You get clarity! oooo, I get clarity...that makes me your toy, not mine. And don't worry...Verant is finding you other dealers for your crack.<P>This isn't about a stupid spell you get at level 29, this is about the viability of enchanters at ALL ages... not just high level, and not just low level.<P>I think I've ranted enough... thanks for listening, and sorry to those I've offended.<P>~Abilis Kiora<BR><P>------------------<BR>"Boy, that was a close call..thank goodness for that Guard!"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000226&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>what are all the enchanters whining about? Enchanter A says oh my pet sucks i never use it, but now they nerfed it im pissed and i want something else... Thats like a wizard saying OMG they nerfed MAGNIFY!!! give me better dd now... yes i have an enchanter, and we can solo just fine, i didn't even know about the weapon thing until level 20, and i could solo even/yellow mobs with ease.. You enchanters just need to learn what spells to use in a given situation, and what spells not to use. Learn your class for crying out loud. The nerf doesn't affect enchanters hardly at all... btw, spells the necros got for "compensation" suck tons, and shadow knights get one of them at 39, while necros get it at 44... You enchanters are just looking for something to whine about, your pets are still good compared to a necro's pets now, except you can't give them commands. Enchanters don't even need their pets unless they are soloing, and at higher levels you can solo just fine without them. Much more could be said, but i think i've covered the major areas. Nothing else needs to be said.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000228&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>i tried to read these messages but way too many!!! i havn't seen so far, anyone mention that our pets do not even get dual wield until 29... which i just got as of yesterday. And the dual wield really doesn't help much at all!!! I tested, gave a pet a weapon and it did about the same damage as one without.. and i had a lower friend con both they were both even to him at 26... I use my pet alot, because on Tallon Zek there is a much higher enchanter ratio than any other server(Vallon Zek excepted of course) thus my servicis are RARELY needed in a group... i am basically FORCED to solo. Our pets are way too weak as it is.. no commands, some ok damage, but no hp or ac or any other sort of spells!!! Also many of our spells are largly useless... WTYH is resisted way too much and way too short of a duration.. our damage spells are all resisted about 40% of the time WITH tashani (at least with my experience with them). And our quickness spells really arn't up to par with what they should be. debuffs? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA stacking all 3, languid pace, feckless might, and (forgot the name of my level 29 one=) anyway with all those on they hit on average about 1 to 2 points less!!! one to two points!!! and i wasted over 100 mana on that? and their attack speed is BARELY noticably decreased.. and I mean BARELY!!!!!!!!!! We really need to be looked at, our class , although fun and has a variety, is SEVERLY underpowered.. we cannot even do what we were meant to do... ENCHANT ITEMS!!!! Give us some sort of enchantments!!! I mean damn, you even took away our weak little light enchantment (pre-release). But at least we had one!!! PLEASE look at our class again, it is VERY underpowerd compared to other classes (I have played many classes up to about 12, and at 12 i can honestly say they rival my level 29 enchanters in damage dealing as well as other aspects of combat!!!)<P>-Darrowin Spellweaver<BR>Seriously bummed enchanter of the 29th level, Tallon Zek<BR>Leader of The Spellweavers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000233&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I do not have an enchanter char, but I am sympathetic to their frustration. I must say that while its obvious that enchanter pets were never very powerful or useful to begin with, its now very clear that this latest nerf has opened my eyes as to just how unbalanced the enchanter class is.  Why are so many spells useless and/or redundant? (Why cast werewolf illusion when you have quickness?)  I am told that enchanters are useless after lvl 40 because everything resists them in the planes.  Wow, so if the rumored 10 more levels comes out with the add on pack will the enchanter be a clarity caster and buffer (group lackey) for 20 whole levels?  This can't be Verant's true intent.  I do hope that they become aware of this issue and address it.  The enchanter class could be so much more than what it is and yet not upset the balance of the game.  I know that this topic is about enchanter pets being ignored, but its clear that the enchanter himself has been ignored.  Its would be nice if enchanters could truely be just that.  <P>Atumar 31 Wizard <BR>Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000235&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Ok...first of all, I'm gonna admit that like pretty much every other enchanter, I don't use a pet.  Yah, if I solo I'll use it sometimes, but not that much.  So as far as that goes, this slight nerf on our pets is really no big deal, as far as I can see.<P>However, what I do have a problem with is Abashi.  Enchanters get the best pet speed buffs in the game...well, except for necro's.  Yup, that's right, maybe at 49 with Swift I'll be able to speed my pet up more then a necro, but as it stands right now, Celerity is slower than the pet buff necro's get.  What that means is that for the majority of the upper levels (you know, the ones when you are actually getting xp) Necro's, NOT enchanters, have the fastest hitting pets.  Get a clue, Abashi.<P>Axterix En'Obelix<P>And Abashi said "No, no, sk's and paladins are fine just the way they are."  And then Sk's and Paladins were changed, for he was wrong.<BR>And then Abashi looked upon the Magician pets, and again he spoke "No, they dual wield."  And again he was wrong, For a patch was added so that the pets of magicians could indeed dual wield.<BR>And then Abashi spoke again, in his wisdom "Enchanter's pets hit faster." ...well, lets see how long this load of BS stands.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000242&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>You got nerfed with pets? HA!<BR>Magi were nerfed from the start! Magi HAVE the best pets in the game, we gave up some DD and port spells to get them! so dont you complain how you are nerfed! your pets just there as a aid, its not their to allow you to solo like Bummed stated, EQ is a game of GROUPING, Yes, they do need to make you wanted at lower levels, but you wern't nerfed! this is the way it was meant from the start... so dont complain about your pets being weak, if you want to have nice pets then why did you make a enchanter? and you cant control your pets because thats another side effect, you arn't pet masters, enchaters are a GROUPING class, not meant for SOLO'ing, so if you made a enchanter with soloing in mind you didn't know what you where doing from the start...

</FONT><HR>"Enchanters are not a pet class..."  <P>Many have said this.  But what these same people fail to realize is that enchanters are are no Shaman who can actually tank and heal at lower lvl, or SK who can melee at lower lvl, the other 2 classes who are not suppose to be a pet class.  Don't put enchanters on the same boat with these 2 classes because clearly enchanters cannot match at younger lvl.  Without a decent pet how will you except an enchanter to go up form lvl 1-28?  grouping?  Why would someone want an enchanter without clarity?  I would take a necro or mage over an enchanter almost every single time before lvl 29th when grouping.  So that will leave an enchanter to solo most of the time.  But how?  Charm you said?  That is a lvl 12 spell...what to do from lvl 1th to lvl 11th?<BR>Come up with a good strategy to kill blue mobs with your pet til lvl 12 you said?  Well geez guess enchanters ARE a pet class afterall.  Does SK or Shaman, the other 2 class being compare to, need a pet to solo from lvl 1th to 11th?  I don't like to complain and at time I do get tire of people complaining, and although the "nerf" didn't affect me that much for I am a high lvl enchanter who doesn't rely on the pet that often nor solo that much, BUT I be darn if I be as selfish or ignorant to just worry about what affect me and ignore about other.<BR>The reason that I didn't participate in any other classes complain is because I have not played any other classes yet to judge how the changes affect them, but I played an enchanter from lvl 1 to now(43th) and know how hard those lower levels were.  I consider myself a quick thinker and innovator and if given a chance I think I can get an enchanter character up to high lvl again, but I don't expect everyone to think like I do, nor do I expect everyone to enjoy the challenge and be able to figure out a good strategy for those early levels.  Well a smart person and good player might said that he/she can still solo with an ench at low lvl even with the changes, ofcouse he/she can.  While I don't denial that even with the change an enchanter can still solo with some success at lower lvl, BUT what we need tosee is how hard it would be for an ench to kill something compare to a necro or mage to kill something at the same lvl and played by the same intelligent person.  I can almost guarentee that we can see the difficulty(which in term show the power) among the 3 classes.  Now forget about enchanters being powerful later on in life..but against what?  other players yes but never against other NPC...would you want a wizard IC on Nagafen or an ench Discodant Mind on Nag?  Some of enchanter spells that would render other players helpless in a duel(mana sieve for casters and str/agi debuff for meleers)  DOESN'T work against NPC...put all the str debuff line on an NPC and I be suprise if I can tell the different in damage...Mana sieve an NPC caster?  I have yet to see an NPC oom...all in all enchanters never complain much before because most who played an enchanter are people who can adapt and adjust to what they have to utilize(i.e. a thinking player), but there is a point where you have to stand up and said enough is enough, don't give credit to the class power when it's usually the players who make the class strong.<P>SO...In conclusion, if enchanters are not to be a pet class, I will gladly give up my pet series along with a couple more series(sight, mana, etc) for a SNARE...that's right...A SNARE...one of the best spell from the druid arsenal...With it and a mind of an enchanter,  I can almost certain that most enchanters would gladly make the trade..why?  soloing will be much easier, even at low lvl, and even at low lvl an enchanter will be gadly accepted in a group or partner...Which was what the people at Verant intended for enchanters to do is it not?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000244&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>This nerfing is getting pretty stupid, kinda funny how they think we enchanters are "too powerful". Well we should be able to buff our pets with the spells we have, not have a crappy pet and try to nuke something! I have a fairly low level enchanter but I am no newbie to this game and I feel that verant is nerfing and recompensating the WRONG classes. Verant, if yer gonna nerf the enc's so much at least give us some more powers. Such as more illusions/spells or let us enchant items themselves. Whats the point of getting our haste line spells when other classes get them as well and we cant even put em on our pets? P.S. Im getting really pissed off at not being able to log into EQ, they gotta fix the overcrowding too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000245&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

I guess you just want somthing to whine about, but at least whine about something legitimate.

Who the F#$K is going to cast a spell that takes 300 of thier mana a give 100 to someone else..

</FONT><HR>Lol! The funny thing about this whole thing is that Verant could have simply given Mage's pets all the upgrades and left the other classes alone and avoided all this madness. Obviously, Necro's and Enchanter's weren't blowing things out of the water beyond reason or Verant would have nerfed us both long ago during the first pet nerfings. The fact that they did this is laughable. And they thought that people would accept it. Well some will over time, not me. I'm not playing my Enchanter until we have a SUITABLE comepensation. And since the only others classes I care to play are already lvl 50, I guess I'll have time to go by the Comp stores and see whats new on the shelf. Yea, that is smart business Verant. Lol. I hope you guys are taking notice. Every time you do a nerf of this type, the players get more vocal and more angry. Do really think you will be able to do this many more times? Especially when more competition is on the market? Piece of advice. Think before you nerf. It might save a business  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000247&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">
