<table border='0' width='85%'>
  <tr>
    <td valign='top' align='left'><font size='2' face='Arial'><b><p align='justify'></b>I am writing this
    editorial after I spent another night in the Plane of Fear. Before I get into the reason
    for this editorial, let me first give a brief background of my game experience. I have
    played the game since phase III and since the first day of retail. I have a level 50
    wizard Kalyn and a level 50 enchanter Nylak on Xegony. I did fear the day it came out and
    on and off weekly since that day. I went to hate the day it came out and have been off and
    on since that day. I belong to a guild called the Inner Circle, we are made up of some of
    the most experienced players on Xegony. We have killed Vox, Nagafen, Phin, cleared the
    Plane of Fear, cleared the Plane of Hate (not since the roamers started respawning but we
    will). That said let me get to my complaints about the Plane of Fear.</p>
    <p align='justify'>Today the guild decided to do the Plane of Fear because we had done the
    Plane of Hate the last two days. We wanted to give everyone a chance to get their class
    specific armor. I don&#146;t know exactly how many people we ended up with but I would
    assume about 30. We of course had balanced groups and everyone buffed to max before zoning
    in. Now I don&#146;t know what cheese tactics everyone else uses to get into the zone but
    what we do is this. Everyone gets an invisibility and we zone in one group at a time. Once
    that group gets to the corner the next group comes in. Now in all the times I have done
    the Plane of Fear one of two things happen at this point and it is purely based on luck.
    Number one, most or all of the people that are trying to get to the corner get there
    without agroing something. Each time this has happened we have had a great time in fear.
    We kill any roamers as they come and then start pulling. Now it should be said that after
    this point, the zone is in no way easy or safe. We still get over pulls and people die,
    and every once in a while we have to evacuate. Now I know I for one have no complaint
    about the zones difficulty at this point. If you have enough people that know what they
    are doing it is fun, challenging and overall a good time. </p>
    <p align='justify'>Now lets get to scenario two, which is people start to zone in and are
    met as soon as they stop zoning by something hitting them. So now basically everyone in
    that group dies, so you are down six people. Now the next group try&#146;s to zone in a
    few minutes later, boom they are met with mobs at the zone in point and are promptly
    killed. So now what we have is 12 people dead, who haven&#146;t even had a chance to cast
    a spell on a mob. We have four or five tanks spread half way across the world, no weapons
    or armor to defend themselves with. One thing that should be said is we do have monks
    sometimes FD at the zone or try and drag mobs away from the zone but this does not help at
    all. There are so many mobs that roam to the zone that by the time he says zone and we are
    done 30 seconds have passed. Who knows how many mobs have come by then, again based
    totally on luck. Well lets get back to it and I&#146;ll explain what happens next, which
    is corpse recovery.</p>
    <p align='justify'>Well now our massive force of 30 people is down to 18 ready to fight
    people and 12 people that are hardly any help at all. That&#146;s right we are down 12
    people and we haven&#146;t even had a chance to defend ourselves. So the struggle of
    getting bodies begins. We try the standard drag a corpse to the corner start to loot and
    try and gate out before anything attacks you. It is my opinion that this is impossible due
    to the fact that as soon as you take off invisibility a mob that you can barely see from
    200 feet away will somehow see you and run up and start attacking. So then we of course
    try to send in a cleric with a gater to rez in a tank at a time and gate out. Again
    totally based on luck.&nbsp; At this point you have to pray that the two can zone in, find
    the tanks corpse, and drag it to a semi safe place for a rez. Secondly you have to hope
    that in the time it takes for that tank to zone in from rez, loot his gear, and the gater
    to port that nothing has come close enough to attack you. Again totally based on luck. A
    bard in this situation greatly increases your odds because they can play there
    invisibility song. Two problems with this, are that bards are not always available and
    that scarelings laugh at invisibility and come kill you regardless. So by this point
    everyone is quite upset, a lot of the people who were lucky enough to not zone in are
    suddenly disappearing, logging or pretending to go ld. Meanwhile attempt after attempt to
    zone in are taking place; 90% of which are met with death. Today for example I attempted
    to get my corpse back and died five times. Now I logged on today just into level 50. I
    logged of just a couple hours latter, two bubbles into level 49. What is more amazing then
    this is that not once during all those deaths did I cast one spell. Finally today, which
    is Friday I just logged off, and plan to wait until Tuesday after the patch to go get my
    stuff when the zone is empty. So at this point I will pose questions to Verant, after
    which I will propose my own answers.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Why have you created a zone in which luck not skill is the only thing that determines if
        a large group of your paying customers will have a night of fun, or a night of gut
        wrenching corpse recovery, death and experience loss.</li>
      <li>Why is it not possible to create a semi safe way to enter the zone, quite the same way
        hate was done. I for one think hate and fear have about the same level difficulty, but in
        hate corpse recovery is never a concern. Nor is loosing massive amounts of experience
        because you almost always get a full exp. rez after you die.</li>
      <li>Why is it that GM's or guides are not allowed to help with this zone. How does it hurt
        game balance if the GM's help some 30 paying customers get back there bodies. If we all
        died because we were unskilled and bit off more then we could chew, we would have no
        problem with it, but the only reason we are dying is because we are zoning in blind and
        defenseless. </li>
      <li>Why does cazic randomly select people to summon and instant kill even if he isn&#146;t
        agro and that person is not anywhere near him. What does this add to the zone but to ruin
        a players night, again totally based on luck, or bad luck as it may be. </li>
      <li>Lastly and this sort of repeats number one. Why can&#146;t the players have a way to get
        into the zone. And then tackle the zone based on their skill, group composition and
        teamwork. Why are we forced to zone in with these cheese like tactics which essentially
        leaves our forces separated and defenseless against the mobs in the zone. </li>
    </ol>
    <p align='justify'>Okay here are my suggestions to make the Plane of Fear more enjoyable,
    useable, and to get it back to what it should be, which is a zone that takes a great group
    of players to fight there, not group of lucky players. </p>
    <p align='justify'>1,2, 5. Give casters, druids or wizards a gate to fear. Now what you do
    to ensure that roaming mobs are not able to attack people as they gate in is this. Empty
    one of the houses in the zone. I don&#146;t know which one and really it doesn&#146;t
    matter. Now you make this house like the boat. No spell can be cast while inside the
    house, in the same respect no mob could get inside the house, in fact the mobs would go
    about their normal roaming patterns as if the zone were empty. So now you have everyone
    zone into this zone in this way. All groups are together in the house, and when they are
    ready all leave the house at once. Boom they summon pets and are ready to fight. It should
    be said that the door to the house should be one way. Much like the gate to fear once you
    leave the house you can in no way get back in, except to maybe gate in. The fear portal
    spell should not be useable in the zone, this would to easily allow people to escape
    death, step outside the house get healed and be back in the fight. Much like the portal to
    hate this could be used to remove some money from the economy. I would gladly give up
    250pp personally every time I went to fear, just to ensure I had a chance to fight before
    I was killed and doomed to a night of corpse recovery. After all I have over 20k in pp
    between my characters and I quit looting corpses for loot six months ago, what other use
    is there for it.</p>
    <ol start='3'>
      <li>Give the GM's some leeway on when they can and can&#146;t help with the planes. Many
        times we die to bugs in the planes and sometimes a gm will fix it and sometimes they will
        not stating basically they don&#146;t have to because we were warned. Yes this is true
        that we were warned that the zone was hard. But we were not warned that a stuck mob will
        kill us all and doom us to a night of corpse recovery. I don&#146;t ask that GMs's do
        corpse recovery for us every time, but if 30 people have been trying to get bodies back
        for 6 hours, many people lose 5 or 6 bubbles of experience, can&#146;t the GM's intervene?
        &nbsp; After all this is a large group of very unhappy customers. We don&#146;t pay to
        play the game because we love dying over and over and I don&#146;t think you designed the
        game for us to do this. </li>
      <li>Take out the random summoning and death touch that cazic does now. This is not to say
        that he should not death touch when people are fighting him. As a matter of fact I think
        that feature adds great fun to the fight. On the other hand it serves no purpose to
        randomly pick a player have them summoned to cazic, instantly killed and basically stuck
        under Cazics big toe for god knows how long. This player, who 20 seconds ago was having a
        lot of fun is now outside of the zone wondering what happened, naked and has no idea when,
        if ever he can get his corpse back. </li>
    </ol>
    <p align='justify'>Well that is all I have to say about the zone. I hope to get some
    response on this editorial I have spent a good deal of time thinking about the subject,
    talking to other players, chatting about it on discussion boards, and in writing the paper
    itself. Although it pains me to do so I think I am going to have to keep out of this zone
    until something is changed. I know many others that feel the same way. We all have a blast
    when we work together fighting in the Plane of Fear but many of us don&#146;t think that
    it is worth taking the chance of having a night of corpse recovery, massive death, and
    massive experience loss, all entirely based on luck.</p>
