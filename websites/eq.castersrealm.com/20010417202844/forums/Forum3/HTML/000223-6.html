</FONT><HR>I've played a Mage well into his thirties and switched to the Teams server and started an enchanter.  I liked it so much that I quit my mage and started another enchanter on a regular server.  I have to say first that the mages *were* underpowered and deserved a pet upgrade, they got a heal and now a quad attack - plus an upcoming change in Burnout, as I understand.<P>Now, they have decided to drop the Enchanter right to where the mage was before the enhancments - but I don't want to go back to playing my mage.  If you want to nerf the Enchanter pet to the point that it's useless, why not just take it out.  "We're not a pet class."  Then nix the pet, because it's doing us no good.  Instead make Charm usefull.  How about this;  First make it so that we can at least charm blue mobs at higher levels.  Second, give us 30 seconds notice before charm runs out.  "A Orc Oracle Shift uncofrtably".  Third, make our charms refreshable.  Charm starts to fade, recast it.  This will keep Enchanters in Mana check, and give us a usefull and really fun ability - And in my case, it would even please me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000125&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Just a thought.  If we are the enchanters and pets are not our bag.  Perhaps remove our pets but make the Charm series significantly usable?  Perhaps it's a mana drain?  You cast it and it continues to remove mana as maintainence?  Costs more the higher the mob or difference it is to you?  It recovers when you run out of mana or it is disenchanted?<P>Something to think about, this could be a REAL enchanters pet?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000127&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Just adding my rant to the list ... I haven't read all the other posts, there are just too many.  A good indication that we enchanters really are significantly affected by this nerf ... One of the tools in our array has gotten cripled and it gives us less options on how to handle a situation ...

</FONT><HR>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Baelish:<BR><B>OK.  So what do you all think of Abashis's post? <BR>You can view it at <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=768" TARGET=_blank>http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=768</A> <BR></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>OFFICIAL REPLY REQUESTED<BR>It was stated that you are fine with the effect on enchanter pets, because they should not be able to out dmg other pets like necros. So we have to make enchanter pets weaker so that when we use ALL of our buffs to buff our pet up our pet is now EVEN (or very close) with that of a necro or a mage AND NOW I'M OUT OF MANA. Your not balancing the pets to each other when you add in our buffs, your balancing our entire character class as enchanters against that single necro or mage pet... by the time I med up buffs are half gone (approx) This is not balanced classes. Your stating you think necro pets should be stronger fine. They could be stronger based on non-buffed necro pet vs. non-buffed enchanter pet but in that case, our buffs would need to have a LOT higher bonus to balance out class wise, or just make the pet stronger to begin with. "If they (enchanter pets) were immune to those effects they'd be able to put out more damage than necro pets can currently. Enchanters have the ability to cast better speed buffs than other classes" This to me reads basically enchanter pets have to be made super weak so even after their buffed up necro pets are still stronger." You are adding our character bonuses to the pet in order to make him on even with the necro pet, when it should be much stronger, with our buffs. If not then I buff my pet, I am out of mana, and this is the enchanter class being equal to a necro with full mana AND his pet (considering both classes start with pet summoned and full mana). Therefore, the necro has a pet equal to my pet (when buffed, wich cost me all my mana); plus he has full mana and I have squat. To be actually (on the character lvl) balanced if it costs me full mana to summon and buff my pet the dmg he does equal that of the necro's summoned pet + all the dmg he can do with his spells (with his remaining mana). In short, I am not saying necro pets should not be stronger unbuffed. I am saying in all you have to take in mana costs, time, spell duration, exc... If you do want to include our buffs, it has to be whatever dmg our pet can do + whatever dmg we can do or stop (via slow, weak, debuff) with our remaining mana AFTER buffing the pet (to balance out time vs dmg, no down time even for both classes, neither rest); that amount of dmg should equal the amount of dmg done by the necro pet + the necro's dmg spells with full mana now (were not counting summoning pet both classes have pet summoned and full mana, and assuming both classes same level and same level of pet is summoned). Therefore, with this equation of enchanter class dmg = necro class dmg, when you leave our buffs on the pet and take the necro out of the fight lol our pet should be weaker or even (as stated)? That is far from balanced classes. Our pet should be able to take multiple necro pets with our buffs. If not where is our class's power coming into play. If were out of mana you can't account for more spells unless you skip buffing the pet and do something else instead with that mana. The time has to be accounted for or else you could say an lvl 1 could do as much dmg as an lvl 50 if you gave him several hours and gave the lvl 50 only 5 minutes. Their making us (ENCHANTER CLASS IN A WHOLE) EQUAL to that of another classes pet (example given necro) The saddest thing is don't even compare us to magicians their pet would demolish ours with full buffs the mage wouldn't even have to cast a single spell. I think it is all backwards. Take each class starting with a pet summoned and full mana. They each buff their pet with their class's spells, you can do dd / dmg spells or debuff (so count dmg not taken due to debuff) only with what is left (mana). We use all our mana buffing our pet wich does less dmg than another classes pet + they still have full mana to bomb the hell out of us! I understand its a very complex game, mistakes happen, who knows maybe I've left something out? Does anyone there really play an enchanter, or do they just play with an enchanter?<p>[This message has been edited by fryyguyy (edited 02-02-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000129&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Finally, we have enchanters crying out loud against Verant...   <P>I've been waiting for Abashi's response about enchanter status on last pet nerf, and what I heard was exactly what I expected:<BR>"We're at Verant are ok with it..."  Of course you are, none of you play an enchanter...  If Abashi take the time to start  an new enchanter itself, and try to play for a few days, we will probably say that he doesn't know why the hell someone even play with that s#$@...(He would probably never get pass level 4 since he don't know a s@#% about how to play an enchanter)<P>Of course we are good at crowd control, it's the only thing that they didn't nerfed yet... But do not worry, when you reach level 50, your crowd control abilities will be made useless because "THAT WOULD BE AN EXPLOIT".<P>Every single time some class find a smart way of using his spells to kill  a very hard enemy, here comes Verant's team shouting EXPLOIT!!! and then do a quick fix, which means breaking one or two of the used spells. They do not care if that will mess with several other tactics, or if the class will become more similar to another one because of spell crossover(but a weaker version, of course). They broke Charm and fear for PVP(It's too powerfull, let's render it absolutely useless), wtyh and ddd(it's too powerfull, let's render it useless), kiting(druids here)( it's too powerfull, let's make it useless), High level crowd control on planes(it's too powerfull, let's make it useless). They will one day perceive that THEY ARE TOO POWERFULL, so they must be rendered useless. This is what will happen when someone smart enough to learn with their mistakes will make a game that is better than EQ...<P>Whenever someone ask for an explanation,  they come with some well tought answer, based on facts that suport their fix. They ignore all other side effects, unsuporting facts, class unbalance and customer satisfaction. And if you say they are wrong, they say they have the data and so they are right. Then you use a tool for gathering data from the game and proving your point, and they ban you. Then you prove, with their own means, that they are wrong and they come with a: " it took only two days!!!" fix that breaks everyone else. <BR>And when you just ask for some repair, since the other affected classes got it, you receive a "We're ok with it".<P>I'm tired of playing on overcrowded servers, wich CANNOT hold more than 1500 players without causing slowdowns, lag bubbles and disconects. I'm tired of searching for new tactics to take down strong enemies alone(since my pet now is more useless than ever) with toy spells, just to see Verant break my tools saying "Stop doing that, you should be eternally dependant of other players that will only keep you alive if you give them clarity..."  (Verant fix, in this case, would be made clarity self-only...)<P>They say our pets would outdamage a Necro's pet if they had better weapons speed and our speed buffs... But they seems to ignore what EVERY SINGLE IDIOT THAT EVER PLAYED THIS GAME knows, that our pets have almost no HP. Our pet would be killed by a necro pet well before putting in danger this pet's life.<BR>They also seems to ignore that a necro pet obey commands, while our pet have the WORST path algorith that I ever saw programmed and cannot be told to stop moving like and idiot and getting ALL MOBS ON A DUNGEON OVER ME. Also whenever you mez a group of enemies that the stupid pet got by itself upon you, he will just make one hit in each one of them to break the mez(I almost got crazy when I saw my pet doing that to 4 minos, never tought it would be so stupid to wake ALL mezed mobs...). <P>Other briliant players say they do not need pets at all, and that they played for a long time without them, etc, etc, etc... I don't know how this is possible,probably they made the MOBS to laugh so hard about those patetic attempts to make a spell go through the MR that they just had a heart attack...<P>Let's make it clear:<P>1)Our DD are ok, but we have few of them and they are a mega-taunt, and have high resist rate.<BR>2)Our debufs works against other players , but do not work against MOBS. And have a mega-taunt on it too...<BR>3)Our speed and slow buffs works great, so every other single class is getting a spell that does the same trick an item that gives that for free.<BR>4)Our sight spells are just a  toy, they have no use at all, not even for quests, which are almost unexisting except for powerlevelers wich finally reached level 50.(powerlevelers do not care about quests, they only want the items...)<BR>5)Our lull series are useless because they are single target, high resist rate.(will get all the camp over us)<BR>6)Our mez/stun series works(THANKS GOD), so they cannot be used on serious targets/areas.(and when it fails, it's a mega-taunt)<BR>7)We can charm, but it only last time enough to get you killed.(unreliable and mega-taunt)<BR>8)Tashan series works.(but is a taunt. Acceptable)<BR>9)Our pets have low hp, are usually 2-4 levels bellow us, are stupid(pathwise), do not accept commands, and now cannot dish more damage than other pets while they are alive(they usually die 5 seconds before us...).<BR>10)Enchant items is about 1 item at all(and we have 4 spells for it...).<BR>11)Enchant jewlery works, so all you need is 5Kpp to make something that someone else wanna buy, for 15pp...<BR>12)Illusions are funny, but useless for anything except going inside Neriak or Ogguk.(But if you do not keep invisible, shadowknights will see your religion and KOS you...)<P>Now tell me, if you read this list of FEATURES, instead of what Verant promissed as "the enchanter view", would you start a new enchanter?<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000130&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I'm not too sympathetic too people complaining about how we can't equip our anim with a weapon to lower it's delay anymore. Why? Because I never did and I managed just fine.<P>I soloed my enchanter from level 1 to 20 without too much trouble, and me and my animation made a good team.<P>Sure our animation is stupid, has low AC and hp. That's why I always did some 'tanking' for my anim. Even my poor caster AC and defense was better than my anim's, but he could dish out the damage (like a very long DoT). He could occupy the mob while I took a step or two back to cast a spell, usually fear then a nuke or a gate  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/wink.gif"><P>When i got to 16 and got my speed buff/debuff <BR>we were an even better team. I remember being in Oasis and taking down a yellow con dw caiman and some warrior said 'wow, I couldn't solo one of those when I was 16.' <P>Sure there was downtime due to both hp and mana regen, but it was usaully a welcome chance to /auc my jewelry, and do a little fishing. (Fishing and baking fish fillets  helped to compensate for the lousy loot on some mobs.)<P>All this whining I hear from enchanters about our 'pet nerf' just doesn't cut it with me. Our pet was never meant to be a stand alone tank like a magician's or necro's. comparing our pet to their's is like comparing a rogue to a warrior. Our anim's not the guy to stand in front and take the abuse, but the guy to stand off to the side and whack the mob without drawing too much attention to himself.<P>I don't really care what happens to the pet since I don't use my pet anymore because I'm in dungeons, grouped and doing the crowd control thing. Even if I was still below level 20 and soloing, this 'nerf' wouldn't have affected me and I'd still be looking around, saying 'What's everyone complaining about?' <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000131&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>The people behind Verant must be completely stupid.  Enchanters are useless.  Most groups only want clarity.  I have heard people say to Enchanters just sit over there and keep us buffed and clarity up at all times while we take care of the fighting.  They don't want Enchanter pets cause they will kill the whole group.  They don't want Enchanters using DD cause then there sorce of Clarity is dead.  <P>Change Enchanter Pets:<BR>1.  Make them stop attacking Mezzed creatures.<BR>2.  Make them the smartest of the pets in the game.<BR>3.  Make them controlable (We can force a Hill Giant to do our bidding but can't control a sword  WTF?)<BR>4.  Make them have supertaunt so that what ever its attacking hates only it.<P>Change Debuffing:<BR>1.  Change the debuffs so that they work on MOBS. Debuffing stats like agi and dex dont do squat against NPCS.<BR>2.  Give enchanters Anti-Kick debuff instead.<BR>3.  Give enchanters Anti-double attack instead.<BR>(see what Im talking about USEFUL DEBUFFS)<P>Change Buffing:<BR>1.  Save to all spell debuff line.<P>Change Illusions:<BR>1.  Make them polymorphs with real bonuses.  <BR>2.  Make them zoneable and loggable.  (Nothing like getting booted from server in Oggok and coming back to your death)<BR>3.  Give better healing to tree and troll illusions.<BR>4.  Drybone should proc the spells they cast without taking mana while fighting.<BR>5.  Elemental illusions should proc spells they use and change Saves.<BR>6.  Illusion target should be added so you can look like a bard or warrior.  <P>Remove sight spells:<BR>(who gives a rats ace about looking throw peoples eyes)(WOW WOW WOW with infravision GDamn I'll keep that one memorized always.)<P>Enchanters are a joke in all areas that matter.  Make jewelry and mez are nice but I can feel necros getting those abilities soon.<P>Play a necro cause they are obviously the class of choice to keep strong and powerful.  (BTW necros should have the lowest HP's of all classes IMHO)  <P>Seems like a floating sword would be harder to kill than a skeleton.

</FONT><HR>I posted this on another site..actually my guild site, but I feel it's pretty relevant for here as well... my feelings are the same, at least, and I hope that MAYBE Verant will take a little time to listen to us.<P>Greetings,<BR>After reading through several different websites, all dealing with the new things magicians and necromancers can do with their pets, I got a bit upset. I'm sure that any enchanter knows that basically, our pets suck. But, we aren't a pet class. I would love if they improved my pet, but not as much as some other things. To me, improving our pets is one of the LAST things I want Verant to deal with.<P>Recently, they made a charm change...we are now blessed with the notice of when our charm wears off. Yet, if any of you have charmed things since this occured, the charmed pet is already back on top of us when we finally get the message, and when you are in a messy battle, that is NOT what you want happening. If Enchanters are supposed to be a class that can charm, why not make it that? I would REALLY like a message stating that:"You feel as though you are about to lose control over the mind of (insert creature here)!" That, to me, would be MUCH more productive than a pet improvement in weilding time. <P>Along with that improvement to charm, why not have a set base..say that charm can last at least one minute before breaking. I for one am so intimidated to use charm because it is SO very unpredictable. I've gotten killed too many times by a charmed low blue pet (because I can not even attempt to charm something even with me, let alone above me) because the fight is strong, and no one is there to get it off of me, and I can't cast charm again because of being interrupted. A set time, or a more predictable charm would be very much more welcomed than a better pet. Our pets suck. They get huge trains in dungeons, they get lost, they cause you to get attacked because casting them is such a hassle, and I've yet to cast a black pet to me at level 20!<P>Enchanters are NOT another casting class..we aren't the DoT's, we aren't the DD's, we aren't even really the buffers. We are supposed to be these people that can do crowd control. But, if any of you have noticed, lately resists have increased. After one of the last patches, I can't seem to get lower level things mezed...even with a level 20 tashni. If we are the crowd controlers of Norrath, why do we get so many resists? Why can't we charm, like we are supposed to be able to? Forget the pet, why not go for these improvements, or other ones first?? <P>If you are in a group, a good group, there is no need to have a pet. I stopped using my pet around level 16. It isn't worth the problems that it brings, and since Verant doesn't really feel like making changes to our pet, why not ask for something that we can do, and do well, with the proper help??<P>Those are just my feelings on the subject. Yes, they are a bit strong, no intent to offend anyone... I'm just tired of not being able to do what Enchanters are supposed to be able to do. Why not cry about that a bit to Verant? (Oh..that's right...they never listen  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">)<P>~Abilis Kiora</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000134&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Thank you Fizzlezog for an interesting and analytical reply. I appreciate hearing from another enchanter out there. A couple of things:<P>I have spent most of my career fighting mid-blues, with an occasisonal black. I understand that people are eager to kill stronger opponents, but that has not been my particular style. In doing this, I have perhaps noticed less resists and longer durations on spells. In fact, I strongly suspect that this is why some spells are more useful to me.<P>As for Charm, I have had great success controlling overpulls with it. 3 legionnaires spawn in the Crushbone Throne Room and attack my party? I charm one, have it kill a second, while my party kills the third. The charmed one will usually either die, or kill its opponent and be left with very little life, whereupon I simply cast invisibility and the group kills it. I have had Charm break before the group was ready to turn to the Charmed monster, but I would say it happens only 1 every 10 times I use Charm. Considering that it can save my entire party from destruction, I think 1 out of 10 odds are acceptable.<P>I use the Choke spell a lot, don't get me wrong. But I see lots of enchanters who use it like a DD instead of a DoT and chain cast it. And it does make it impossible to mesmerize a monster if that becomes necessary. As for the Chaotic Feedback line, I know the value of quick damage at times. However, there is almost ALWAYS someone in my group who can do more or equal damage, and is happy to do it. So I tend to leave this to other group members. I am not saying Enchanters should not use these spells, I am saying Enchanters should expect to do more than these spells in order to be good. I have never had trouble getting into a group, even when areas like Crushbone are crowded. After saving a couple groups of lvl 12s by Charming or otherwise controlling crowds, I sometimes get offers when I am just playing around with Levitate or something. I have played solo quite a bit, mostly high greens and very low blues, but I prefer to group of course. In any case, the thing about my animation that tends to get me killed most often while soloing is its tendancy to run to the opposite end of the zone. I've had it as far away as the south end of Kelethin when I was attacked while meditating at Crushbone. Needless to say, by the time it gets back, I am dead. I would love to see animations actually behave, and maybe get that reduced damage/increased speed change. On the other hand, I suspect that that problem is inherent to the monster code, rather than animation code. Most orcs I have seen hit for the same no matter what weapon they wield. It may just be beyond Verant's ability to adjust this. I wish they would though, that would make far more sense that a dagger would make an animation attack quickly but for less damage.<P>I guess to some extent it all depends on your style of play and your group's style of play. I go fairly slowly, tackling lots and lots of blue monsters. Others that prefer harder foes or whose group prefers harder foes could find their debuffs less effective. Also, I would have to say that I would love to see some kind of temporary enhancement spell to cast on weapons and armor. The only problem would be targeting it. What I do NOT want to see is more permanent item enchantment spells that are involved with the Trade skills. Just my personal opinion here.<P>Oh, also, about illusions being useless. How many spells do we get at level 12? 16 if I am reading the list correctly. Of those, 4 are Illusions and one is Thicken Mana. That leaves 11. How many classes get 11 spells per spell level? Not wizards, that's for sure. The only level 12 spell I basically never use out of the 11 is Enduring Breath. That leaves 10 good spells (IMO) at level 12. I cannot justify complaining about that. I just view the Illusions as neat little toys we get as extras. If they do nothing, so what? Would you rather not have them at all? In any case, I still think Enchanters have the ability to do a range of jobs from pure damage prevention to a mix of that and boosting the party to a mix of damaging and preventing damage. I guess I should have said earlier that Enchanters shouldn't be purely defined by how much damage they can do.<P>Althien of E.

</FONT><HR>I forgot to mention my experience with Whirl in more detail. I have had it last from a mininum of 5-6 seconds to a maximum of around 20 seconds. (I lost track of the number of ticks of the clock over my computer) For all I know, the Whirl might have lasted longer if the monster had stayed alive. Now granted, some of those might be inflated a bit by a lucky bash that lands at the end of a whirl, but I find that rather insignificant statistically. My personal best was on an orc oracle in Crushbone, which was high blue. This was actually suprising to me because oracles are supposed to have such high Magic Resistance. Anyway, I would say about 1/3 of the time it lasts 5-6 seconds, about 1/3 of the time it lasts 11-12 seconds, and the rest of the time it lasts 15+ seconds. Now, maybe I just happen to be blessed by the random number goddess, but if this is at all typical, I think it's worth it for only 55 mana. How many missed attacks is that? How many hit points worth of damage is not done? How much mana did the cleric save by not having to heal it?<P>Althien of E.

</FONT><HR>Here's my beef.  They found out after much insistance of the mage groups out there that mage pets were not doing what they should.  To make the mage pets the most powerful they included a LARGE nerf to Necro and Enchanter pets.  Necros whined and were given a load of spells to shut them up.  <P>My main gripe:<BR>The spells and abilities given necros devalued Enchanters, big time.  Clarity replacement, suffocate (our best damage/efficiency spell).  What does an enchanter do that necros can't?  Speed buffs, debuffs, charms (necs have a better undead charm), and illusions (party tricks).<P>What do necros have?<BR>Commandable pet, screaming terror (mez with 100% mem-blur), HUGE DOTs, Fear, Darkness (snare), built in manastone, illusions, self and party (though not hugely effective) heal...<P>The list goes on, I'm sure I've missed a few.  No, I don't want necros nerfed, but I think we the Enchanters of Norrath have quietly taken the shaft one too many times.  I'm all for an organized walkout and would gladly switch to an alternate character for a week.  Give Norrath a week without Enchanters and perhaps you'll hear other classes pitching in on our complaint to Verant.<P>I've bout had it, into the mothballs goes the 50 Enchanter, gonna go start me a necro or magician.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000137&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Baelish,<P>I would like to add my own comments to the ones you added to Sethilins's<BR>regarding Verant's recent changes to pets and other adjustments that<BR>have either by design or oversight narrowed the role of enchanters to<BR>simply being an auxilory group support character class restricted to<BR>mezz, charm, stun, clarity and minor buffs and debuffs.<P>First I'd like to make a brief statement about why I chose the Enchanter<BR>class.  Before playing EQ I was very actively involved with a card game<BR>call Magic the Gathering(tm).  Without going into a long winded tutorial<BR>on the game the idea was that two magicians practicing any of 5 types of<BR>magic lets call them light, dark, fire, nature, water would duel each<BR>other to the death.  The idea was that two mages would sit opposite one<BR>another and randomly suffle their spell book each in turn drawing spells<BR>from their book and casting them so as to do 20 life points of damage to<BR>the other.  The first mage to have his life points fall to zero or less<BR>at the end of their turn or be unable to draw a spell from their spell<BR>book (deck) would lose the duel.<P>Each class of magic therefore had to have ways of dealing damage and<BR>defending against taking damage.  However, if one was to analyze the<BR>five types of magic, blue (the magic of water) had the least number of<BR>direct or indirect damage spells.  As a result in the early days of the<BR>game few people bothered to build a spell book using any blue magic.<BR>However, what blue did have was a lot of spells that denied other<BR>casters from casting their spells and redirecting the damage of other<BR>spells onto the caster and spells to allow the blue caster to cast more<BR>spells per turn.  Blue was the magic of denial.   I won many tournaments<BR>playing primarily blue magic based decks. In one extreme case I<BR>constructed a deck with only 1 in 60 cards that could deal damage.  Yet<BR>I won and I won A LOT!<P>What is my point?  Well Enchanters in EQ really practice the magic of<BR>denial.  We have few spells that deal direct damage and the ones we have<BR>are among the weakest of all the casting classes and like Mtg(tm) few<BR>people initially created Enchanters except perhaps to be used to master<BR>jewelry with its potential to make large sums of money to fund the<BR>twinking of other (fun) damage dealing characters.  I however,<BR>immediately saw the power of stun, mez, lull, whirl, charm, fear and<BR>major buffs and debufs. I realized that it does not matter how much<BR>damage my opponent can do if he NEVER gets a chance to hit me.  We don't<BR>kill things in one major killing blow.  We deny and coopt.  We absorb<BR>and redirect.  We turn our opponents force against them.  In fact in my<BR>oppinion there is no more satisfying way to win a fight then to prevent<BR>your opponent from delivering that "major killing blow" that "flawless<BR>victory" arcade game style mega death and at the same time killing him 1<BR>agonizing, frustrating, maddening, humiliating point at a time.  I get<BR>all goose bumpy just thinking about it!<P>However, Verant seems to be systematically removing the Enchanters<BR>ability to both deal damage AND defend against taking damage.  We are<BR>more and more being put in the posistion of choosing to do one OR the<BR>other but NOT both.  As baelish so eliquently pointed out, if this is by<BR>design then varent is really giving us only ONE real option - that of<BR>PURE defense.  Thus forcing us to group.  What is worse is that as our<BR>ability to deal damage is EVERNERFed we find that we cannot even have<BR>the satisfaction of dealing any damage what so ever while in groups as<BR>any other class can deal damage more efficiently.  I dare not cast any<BR>of my mana ineffient damage spells while grouped! God forbid I don't <BR>have enough mana to cast clarity on the guys that are having virtual<BR>orgasms with each MOB THEY incinerate.  God forbid I slow THEIR<BR>enjoyment.  God forbid I lesson THEIR feeling of gratification.   No we<BR>are to be content running around frantically trying to keep NPC's controlled that<BR>Konan the Imbesile constantly unmezzes!  We are to be content as within<BR>1 nano-second of our clarity starting to blink we get five requests of<BR>"Hey man you awake?  My Clarity is blinking!" *sigh*  We are to be<BR>content to be seen as nothing more then tools to be used by others so<BR>they can have a great time.<P>Of course I am speaking for my self but if my role as an enchanter is to<BR>spend 8 to 15 hours at a play session listening to:  "My clarity is<BR>blinking", "Crack is going", "I need speed", "Celerity Please", "I need<BR>Insight", "Mezz!  Mezz!" all at once while ALL my buffs are dropping and<BR>I am holding 9 yellow con  MOBS mezzed while being beat on by the MOB<BR>that just broke beguile before I recovered from casting it along with<BR>the MOB I was hoping to sick it on - well I just can't believe any game<BR>designer would think anyone would consider this satisfying in any way<BR>shape or form.<P>If Enchanters are to be forced into a role of purely group support crowd<BR>control and mana pimps then I agree with Baelish's analysis of how our<BR>Mezz, Stun, Charm, Buff and Debuff spells need to be tuned.  But I for<BR>one will not continue to play an Enchanter in this deminished<BR>Imasculated and frustrating role.<P>Just my 2 cents.<BR>Tyhme Tuu'Dyhe (level 44 Enchanter of Prexus)<P>You might want to add these to section 4 of your comments:<P>* Little tuning things on the top of the list for enchanter:<P>(1) The entire whirl line of spells is worthless.  Cost to high, whirl<BR>duration to low, root duration to low, agro factor to high, resist<BR>factor to high.  The NERF's were clearly not designed to tune these<BR>spells but to render them completely useless.  If it was deemed that<BR>they were to powerful then remove them AND GIVE US SOMETHING USEFUL or<BR>at least let me delete them from my spell book so I don't have to see<BR>them and get enraged by the fact that they are now CRAP!<P>(2) The charm line of spells ressist factor at levels 40 and above is<BR>getting to high while charm duration getting insanely low.  Charm is<BR>becoming a suicide spell just like the lull series against blue (for god<BR>sake!) and above.  Duration in many cases is less then the recovery time<BR>to cast it.  As a consequence of the spell breaking before you recover<BR>not only do you have the MOB you intended to charm mega-agro'ing you but<BR>the MOB you intended to sick it on and others possibly as well.  An<BR>additonal effect of any spell that is broken BEFORE you recover from<BR>casting it is that you have effectively STUNNED yourself for the<BR>recovery time while you are helplessly mercilessly beat on and NOT able<BR>to cast!  It also is like a weird form of fizzle if you think about it.<BR>I am going to conduct a study where I will cast each of the charm spells<BR>10 times against a green, blue, white and yellow MOB and count resists<BR>(after casting tashania), fizzes and timing the duration of successful<BR>charms.  I think the results will prove that this line of spells is in<BR>serious need of adjustment.  Case in point I was fighting in SolB and<BR>had just gotten my tashania spell.  I cast tash44 and then proceeded to<BR>be resisted 7 (thats S E V E N!!!) times in a row by a blue con MOB and<BR>I have 5 whitnesses!  I mean cripes verant I am level 44 attacking a<BR>level 40ish mob that has just had its MR reduced by 31 (btw the spell<BR>description on eq.castersrealm.com says 65 - yet another silent nerf?)<BR>and I have a Charisma of 204 yet I get S E V E N resists in a row!  The<BR>2 times it did stick I'd say the duration was 3 secs max.  It would be<BR>suicide to cast this spell on a white or above.  At least when it fails<BR>for blue I can hope to cast AE mezz on myself an prey that I resist and<BR>I can run away before the other 5 kill me in a single attack.  On white<BR>or above well just plan on getting more practice and letting Verant hold<BR>my credit card hostage for that much longer.  I'd think you (verant)<BR>would be better served to keep me as a customer by making me want to<BR>play more characters and have an enjoyable time rather than just hate<BR>every minute and want to make it to final so I can say good bye and good<BR>riddens!<P>(3) stuns to short and to highly ressisted, to easily interrupted,<BR>casting times to long.  This is an "oh hell I am in big trouble and need<BR>time to cast interrupted spell" it is useless if you cannot ever hope to<BR>cast it once you are closed on and the MOB engages in melee and the<BR>duration is shorter then the time of any other spell you could have<BR>possibly hoped to cast.  In addition I just combined the level 44 Color<BR>skew it cost more the color shift takes longer to cast and lasts<BR>according to my measurement 8 seconds (btw the eq.castersrealm.com page<BR>says 12 secs - yet another silent nerf?).<P>(4) For the fear line of spells I have only a minor nit.  This spell is<BR>useless for attack if the MOBs run in a straight line at hyper mega<BR>quantum uber super ultra warp speed and nothing can catch them to hit<BR>them!  Especially since jboots are now for all practical purposes<BR>impossible to get and hell the caster (me) should not be doing the<BR>beating anyway.  That would be my pets job.  This is no doubt a design<BR>solution made by varent to enforce the Enchanter pets are not for<BR>dealing damage concept that Gorden Abashi has stated.<P>(5) This is my favorite!  Enchanter pet AI is seriously broken.  I ask<BR>this question to Abashi directly.  Abashi has stated that Enchanter pets<BR>were never designed to deal damage but to assist in crowd control or as<BR>an emergency spell to delay attackers while we do what I guess Verant<BR>figures Enchanters should do the most - RUN AWAY.  Well then - Why is<BR>the casting time so long?  Why do they deal damage at all? If they are<BR>defensive why do they have no HP's?   I mean cripes Abashi how did the<BR>design meeting for this gem of an idea go ... Lets give Enchanters a<BR>defensive pet that can help them cast uninterrupted or allow them to<BR>escape.  Great idea Biff.  Lets also make them take longer to cast then<BR>it would take a green level 1 MOB to kill a level 50 PC while hitting<BR>for 1 point of damage per round AND hey! lets also make it hit real hard<BR>so it gets the caster to the top of the MOB's hate list AND lets give it<BR>no ability to taunt AND lets not give it any hit points.  Great idea<BR>Buzz lets implement it!  Ah but I digress - AI what about AI?  Well let<BR>me ask you this Abashi if YOU were a DEFENSIVE pet designed to give your<BR>master time to cast or escape and you were being hit for 98 points of<BR>damage 2 times per round and then a ghoul 40 levels below you came up<BR>and started TRYING to hit you for 1 point of damage every 4 or 5 rounds<BR>- Would you stop attacking the MOB hitting you for 98 2 times a round<BR>and start playing patty cake with the Ghoul and let the MOB (oh lets say<BR>an SG) go beat the living snot out of your master.  I have a pile of<BR>paste laying peacefully on the sands of SRO that would be interested in<BR>hearing your response!<P>(6) agree mana seive and curse of the simple mind are useless against<BR>NPC's.<P>(7) strength debuffs are also for the most part useless against NPC's.<BR>I for one would not sacrifice one of my 8 spell slots for these spells<BR>and to sit down mem it, cast it, sit down swap it out for something<BR>useful each battle - although it keep you busy - it would get real real<BR>old.  I am going to do an analysis on this one as well.  I have seen<BR>cases that look something like this.  NPC hits for 64, NPC hits for 68,<BR>NPC hits for 68, (hmmm hitting pretty hard better do something.  sit<BR>mem, stand cast, sit mem), NPC is now really really pissed and has gone<BR>into hyperkinetic agro rage mode, NPC hits for 78, 75, NPC's hits for<BR>74, 78....  *sigh*  This is over course not a real case.  But I have<BR>seen NPC's hit for 40-50 then have their STR reduced by the choke dot<BR>line, the weakness line, the listless line of spells for a total str<BR>reduction of something like 70 points and then hit for an average of 3<BR>points less per round and seem to hit MORE frequently.  We will see when<BR>I get the time to analyze it.  At this point however I have deligated<BR>these spells to the PvP against low str caster case heehee haahaa you<BR>can't move category of spells.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000138&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>The manner in which Abashi handled this issue is appalling.  His recent rash of comments has reminded me of reading Brian Hook's comments on one of the listservs.  Both gentlemen need a short leash when posting.  They need to have their comments approved by someone who is professionally trained and who truly represents the best interests of both the parent company and Verant when addressing PR issues.  I truly hope that both Sony and Verant understand the impact of the image these folks are giving their corporations.  <P>Aside from the terrible way in which this issue and many other issues have been handled by Abashi recently, I'd like to comment on this series of changes and proposed changes.<P>Cailette is a level 41 Enchanter, born and played since beta 4 on Fennin Ro.  Yes, I do remember the incredibly crass comment Brad made about getting an enchanter and heading off to Mistmoore.  And I remember that the age at which enchanters got their magic resistance line of spells got changed from being the last of the classes able to cast it to the first of them.  So perhaps there is some hope that Verant will step up and correct a few of the recent mistakes as well.<BR>Then again, I remember the old Whirl Til You Hurl, which is still effectively useless.<P>Enchanter pets are fairly useless, always have been, always will be for my style of play.  I started playing around with charm at 12th and have always preferred charm to an animation.  I died hard and often in those early years learning how to use charm effectively.  I am VERY effective at it now.  Had my animation not been worthless, I would have never learned the tactics I use now.  But there are times when an animation is the better choice.  The changes have forced me to choose not to be in those situations now.  Considering over-crowding, having any choice removed only leads to an increase in frustration.<P>My issues with the most recent changes to the animations lie in the "compensation" spells given to another class.  I am a skilled Enchantress; I learned those skill with much blood and corpse recoveries when young.  After this patch goes live, all those lessons are for naught.  The class skills I learned have been in effect replicated in another class, who already has their own defining traits.  My class has three areas of skills - crowd control, debuffing and buffing.  Necros now have my base crowd control in screaming terror without having to sacrifice int for cha.  They have a better version of my only battle debuff (choke line).  Now they will have a mana replenishment line of spells that returns mana faster than clarity.  That is one class which can replace all 3 of my abilities.  In addition to replacing these abilities, they bring a strong commandable pet, dangerous DoT's as well as DD.  Can anyone tell me why an enchanter will be choosen for a group over a skilled necro?  And to add insult to injury, a necro does not need a group.<P>With the recent change in the over all magic resistance on monsters that has been introduced fairly recently, an enchanter is very much hampered to ever perform crowd control duties any more.  At level 40, with a cha of 197 recently in Kithicor woods, I was getting consistant 100% resists on mez line, charm line and colors line on several blue monsters.  This is of course after tashani.  Interestingly enough the druid in group was landing double roll resist rates, magic dependent spells while at the same level as I.  I fear what the planes hold instore if I am experiencing these resists now with plane level cha stats.<P>So, what can be done to fix this imbalance?  I am not certain.  Having given necros one aspect of enchanter power already and planning on giving them two more aspects in this upcoming patch, I am not certain that Verant can take these away.  I wonder what they will do when the players who have mastered the art of crowd control, who understand the effects of debuffing and buffing switch to a class with those abilities plus additional skills.  It will surely be too late to save the "balance" then.  And as a friend joked with me today.... the next patch to appear on test will have a Shaman potion to make bars enchanted and a new rogue ability called disguise...which will make anyone in the party look like which ever race/monster they wish.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/rolleyes.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000139&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well, Abashi clearly has never gone through the hassle of soloing with an enchanter.  I can solo just fine BUT my startup and maintenance costs are significantly higher than the other pet classes.  Here's my typical mana costs for soloing seafury cyclops:<P>(All of this info is in relation to a level 50 caster since that's what I am and since that's what Verant seems to be focusing on.)<P>300 for pet<BR>250 for Swift<BR>70 for Shadow<P>620 mana total to get started.<P>For a necro it would be:<P>490 for pet<BR>100 for augment death<P>590 total<P>For a mage it would be:<P>200 for pet<BR>150 for burnout III<P>350 total<P>Now, a necro pet can solo a seafury without the necro casting any spells on the seafury itself.  This I know for a fact.<P>Since mage pets are more powerful than necro pets, I can only assume that their pets can do the same, although I haven't seen it.<P>My enchanter has spent 620 mana so far, and that's just for starters.  I will have to probably spend another 450 mana casting beserker spirit (150 mana per cast) on my pet during the fight to keep it somewhat healthy.  I will also have to slow the seafury at a cost of 200 mana (presuming I'm not resisted on my first cast).  So, my total cost to kill my first seafury is 1270 mana.  Total cost for the necro is: 590 mana, and a mere 350 mana for the mage.  <P>Sorry, but if that's their idea of balance then they really don't know what the word means.  Sure, we get clarity which helps make up for some of that extra mana but clarity doesn't come close to doubling mana regen which is what it would have to do to make up for our significantly higher costs.  I've played a level 50 necro and they can kill seafuries NON-STOP.  No problem.  It's fuggin easy for them.  I can kill them easy too, but at about one third the rate of a necro.<P>I don't know what the rate would be with a mage since I've never had the opportunity to play a lvl 50 mage.  But I would guess with their recent enhancements it's similar to that of the necro.<P>Some people will say that enchanters are supposed to be a grouping class.  But that's a pretty retarded statement.  All classes are  grouping classes.  Verant has intentionally made us dependent on each other.  The sole exception to that rule is the necro and they are currently changing even them to be more group oriented.  When Verant says we are a grouping class they are really saying that we are a very valuable addition to a group.  We can buff, we can debuff, we can do crowd control.  But hey, having a necro is pretty nice too.  Same thing with a mage.  Necro's can even do crowd control now.  So, if necros can do crowd control, I see no reason why our pets should be so much weaker than theirs.  Necros can heal (themselves and others), do massive dmg, summon a powerful tank, and do crowd control.  That's pretty damn impressive in my book.  What can we do?  Umm...summon a weak ass pet that we can't control and will break our mez, crowd control, debuff (in truth there's only 2 debuffs that a chanter ever uses and that's slow and tash), and we can toss out some crack.  The truth is that if it wasn't for speed and clarity, we really wouldn't be of much value in this game at all since necros can do crowd control too.  And lets face it, most of the time I've noticed that most groups have managed to adapt well enough with out our buffs that the do just fine.  There's not that many enchanters out there so obviously a lot of groups will have to live without one.  Guess what?  They survive just fine!

</FONT><HR>It is all about Class Balance, not pet balance. <BR>Compare two classes and a given scenario. Add up the total dmg done or stopped, reduced, by each class. Enchanter and Necro both start with a pet and full mana, we will even throw in a free clarity to the enchanter. Enchanter starts by buffing his pet he's oom or dang close. Necro uses his full mana to do dmg. The pets start fighting but until you get those buffs on your pet cannot even come close to going blow for blow with the necro's. Now you have those buffs on and the pets are, I will even go as far to call it an even fight. However, in the first 30 seconds the necro pet got ahead in dmg + the necro did a lot of dmg himself. Now your all ready behind, the pets are even (for now), you cannot throw blow for blow with a necro. Thinking about that clarity, think again, your going to have to rebuff your pet every so often (time depending upon lvl comparison used) thus you fall behind farther in dmg. If you do not, you fall farther behind in dmg due to your pet loosing horribly to the necro pet. This loops on and on. Lets add things up. One, as you start your pet falls behind against the necro pet. Two you fall behind, using all your mana to buff pet to get an even fight there while the necro bombs you. Three, you cant go blow for blow with the necro. Four, clarity helps but not enough, you still have to rebuff pet every so often (while the necros still dropping bombs). Yes, you regain faster but you loose your edge when you have to keep rebuffing. The longer this goes the farther behind you fall. That is the easy fight too; try doing the same comparison to a magician.<BR>	The classes should balance out. Our strength is in buffing and debuffing. One of our pets with our buffs wich would take close to full mana should be equal to a set class (necro) with his pet and necro using his full mana (considering both classes start with pet summoned and full mana). It has to be equal on both sides. Stating with our buffs make us equal to the necro class is false. If each side is given equal mana and time, we loose drastically. Therefore, our pet with buffs should literally slaughter a necro pet or a mage pet solo, because with our buffs is the power of our entire class vs a mere part of their class. He should be able to take multiple pets.<BR>It seems everyone is not looking at the mana cost, effect, duration, and time as a whole factor (they have to be compared together, if not you could say a lvl 1 enchanter can do as much dmg as a lvl 50 wiz, if you only gave the wiz enough mana for one spell and the lvl 1 enchanter unlimited mana and unlimited time). How can anyone say our pets should be the weakest, where does it supposedly balance out?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000142&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Althien:<BR><B>Thank you Fizzlezog for an interesting and analytical reply. I appreciate hearing from another enchanter out there. A couple of things:<P>I have spent most of my career fighting mid-blues, with an occasisonal black. I understand that people are eager to kill stronger opponents, but that has not been my particular style. In doing this, I have perhaps noticed less resists and longer durations on spells. In fact, I strongly suspect that this is why some spells are more useful to me.</B><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>From your additional feedback, I would say that our primary difference is in preference of solo vs group play.  I have spent most of my days solo where as the number of days I have groups is probably comparable to your solo days.<P>My preference is to solo a 3 camp of mixed blues and greens.  The problem with doing so post nerf is that the additional downtime suffered from the dagger nerf is just enough to make it so that 2 mobs have respawned by the time I am ready to fight again so I have to expent that much more mana re-breaking the pull.  When I can find a second enchanter or antoher pet class to partner with, I do, but most of them want to be in a larger group, which is the part I can not stand.<P>As for your charm experiences, I would realy like to know what your charisma is.  I have 111 charisma with all my items, and I seemt o do well on green charms (2-4 mins), but blue or higher seems nearly instant break.  If I could charm as a legitimate tactic without such fear of it breaking, I would probaly go back to playing my enchanter again.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR><B>Also, I would have to say that I would love to see some kind of temporary enhancement spell to cast on weapons and armor. The only problem would be targeting it. What I do NOT want to see is more permanent item enchantment spells that are involved with the Trade skills. Just my personal opinion here.</B><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Now THAT would be a good rebalancing for our nerf that is in character with our class (if verant can say its not in our character, they have not read the enchanter class description on their own web site  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">)  If I could take a rusty dagger and enchant it to give some kind of a prco witha  10 or 15 minute duration and give it to my pet, that would go a long way to restoring overall balance.<P>Fizzlezog<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000146&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I am another player that hardly ever uses pets. Reason, they break any crowd control you have going. So nerf the pet. Get rid of it altogether if you want. Just give me mes's that don't take forever to cast. Lulls that don't bring the entire group of MOB's on top of me. Charms that don't break instantly. Illusions that hide religion as well as race. Spells that aren't resisted more often than Austin Powers says 'Yeah Baby'. Make us the crowd control experts we are supposed to be. Whether we use it for groups or soloing is our concern. Right now, we can do neither. Groups don't want us until we get clarify, and we can't solo anything because of the unreliability of our spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000147&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>This is just to add a little fuel to the fire, so to speak.. <P>Magicians:<BR>1) Gained the ability to give pets weapons<BR>Meaning:<BR>  A) Their pets can now dual wield - Common Knowledge<BR>  B) They can give their pet a summoned Sword of Runes - Which when given to a pet, procs on ANY creature, not just summoned..<BR>  C) They can give their lower level pet a summoned dagger - Which will allow it to strike magic-only creatures, something that was before now not possible. <P>I expect there to be a change for B and C. I expect it to be as even-handed as the pet change.. E.G. I expect that the Sword of Runes will lose its proc entirely, and that weapons below level 12 that are "summoned" will no longer be considered magical.<P>I would suggest that anyone having a problem soloing with their enchanter request a Sword of Runes from a nearby magician. The proc is about twice as often in the hands of a pet compared to a similar level character... Oh, and your animation need not even hit to get a proc.. All those huge amounts of misses each get a chance. Pays to have a fast pet.<P>On Clarity:<BR>Necromancers have always had spells which will allow them to regain mana faster. They have just been handed a form of self-clarity, plus the ability to "give" mana to other people. The Life Tap DOT's continue to work even beyond the death of the creature... Use it on a Fire Beetle. Cast your "convert health to mana" spell. Clarity. Welcome to the new Necromancer.. <P>I don't have complaints about the pet. I am 39th level.. I still use my pet after the change.. with great efficiency. Less efficiency than before, but for what I choose to fight it's great. <P>What I am not happy with, is that I am an enchanter who cannot enchant an ACTIVE item.. With a lot of money a tinker can make a helm that can provide unlimited water breathing. A mage can summon a ring that casts charges of levitate, or a rod that converts health to mana. A cleric can summon a magical warhammer. A shaman can make a potion that shrinks people (soon).. I can make: Gloves that.. GLOW.<P>The more I look it over, the more I see that Mages, not "Enchanters" are the people who can enchant items.  It's called "Summoning".. But where is it summoned from? Is there a "Plane of Magical Snake Fangs"? Why do "summoned" items suddenly have magical effects? Wouldn't those be considered enchanted items?<P>As long as other classes are getting enchanting spells.. I'll give up every stat-debuff on every spell I have.. For the one thing that makes Necromancers so potent. Make my DOT's snare. Choking monsters shouldn't be able to run as fast. No longer would I be required to partner with a druid, ranger, or necro to solo outside.. No longer would I fear going into UPPER guk at 39th because of the one runner who got away.. No longer would I care that my DOT at 39th takes 90 seconds to be "efficient" when the creature is dead in 30 seconds. (Yes, I still use CHOKE at 39th.. Less wasted mana.)<P>This change to pets is NOT the end to all enchanters.. It is NOT the REAL reason why we're complaining.. It is just the "straw that broke the camel's back" so to speak.  Enchanters are looking forward to their future and not liking what they're seeing. Everything that we've looked forward to about high level enchanters is slowly being torn down, brick by brick. Illusions are no longer anywhere near as effective.. stat debuffs are ineffective(no change, but I remember saying, "Wow! I can drop a monsters strength by 150!" - worthless).. haste buffs have been undermined.. now other classes are even stealing away the "holy grail" of clarity..<P>I will begin refusing clarity tonight. I will no longer spend my time casting Runes on unsuspecting newbies. I will not cast Celerity for anyone but my pet (since it benefits him so much). For those of you more inclined to an "active resistance", I suggest you happily cast and recast Sentinel in Freeport at the gates or bank.. and Kelethin near the bank.. and the Orc Lift... And in the Courtyard of Cazic (nice to know when a train is hitting).. It's such a useful spell.. Why should it be in the back of your book with the others?<P>/Feedback<BR>/Bug<BR>/Petition<BR>E-Mail<BR>Post<P>Have fun...<P>Quell<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000148&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
