</FONT><HR>I am by far no verant ass kisser really. They have done many things I don't agree with, but this is something I think is great.<P>I just find this thread halarious, because what it essentially boils down to, is someone was parsing a file they were told not to parse, and when they got innacurate data, they flipped thier lid. Now if you're gonna parse the file, thats fine, but expect to get burned like this when you flip out over something. It's like a small child who gets burned when his mother tells him not to touch the hot stove, kid does it anyway and he looks bad. Only the kid doesn't try to blame his mother by saying, well you should be doing other things instead of leaving the hot stove on for me to touch.<P>Thats all this is about. People looking bad. They are ashamed because they were had. I mean I have to admit I was had for a minute, then I started really READING what was there, and thought HA this has got to be a joke, and it was. Lighten up people. We all know this has nothing to do with you claiming it's an unprofessional joke, thats nothing more than a cover up for the fact that you were had.  lets all just laugh at it. It was a joke. You were not hurt, onlyu bruised your fragile egos. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000612.cgi&ReplyNum=000225&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Spell+Nerfing+-+All+Read">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Hehe your funny Bill. Guess the servers must still be down!!! And your right about parsing the file.  I was trying to show that it's not entirely unreasonable for these people to feel this way.  And they are by no means schmuks or whiners or whatever.<P>It's obvious that they care about the game, the fact that they take time to post concerns should tell Varent that.  Thats about as good a dedicated customer as your going to get.<P>Let them get their steam out my friend, in the morning they'll all wake up (sooner or later) and have a good laugh at themselves as you and I have had.  They are good people because they care let's not take that away from them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000612.cgi&ReplyNum=000226&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Spell+Nerfing+-+All+Read">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>*Hmmm, some interesting posts here. I'm surprised at the ones that are obviously in the "Verant Arse Kissing Guild" that do not believe no one had a right to be upset at these proposed changes that are hiding under the guise of an April Fools joke. Anyone besides me notice that it's March 28th?*<P>Yes, it's March 28th, have you really read the update post on the castersrealm website?  "Early April Fool's joke"<P>As for the "Verant Arse Kissing Guild", You're completely out of line.  Obviously theres a load full of people who don't take jokes personally, who enjoy the game despite the changes, who REMEMBER the original slogan from Verant even before the game first came out "YOU'RE IN OUR WORLD NOW".  It's not a matter of "kissing arse" or the like, so don't go tagging those who can take a joke.<P>*Having worked in many fields and Marketing being one of them I would have to believe that there is the possiblility that these changes where meant to "test" peoples reactions.*<P>Not to sound mean, but wasn't that the intent?  I seriously don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure that out.<P><BR>* As Bill Hicks said "marketing people are scum, if your in marketing do us all a favor and go outside and shoot yourself". When reactions where, shall we say, not favorable on a mass basis the convenient plot of it's an "April Fools joke you fools" was used.*<P>First thing off it WAS an April Fool's Joke.  A lot of April Fool's Jokes aren't all that nice.  They're pranks aimed at people, designed to get a laugh or two.  This has nothing to do with Marketing.<P>*Today the servers came down for "maintenance" unfortunate for me I had read Lum the mads site and stumbled onto all this fever and hub bub. Needless to say I got nervous and voiced my opinions a bit sarcasticly in ooc chat (only to blow off some steam, surely many of you can understand that) to which one person told me "don't play the game then".*<P>If your gonna voice your opinion on a public chat room channel with multitudes of users it's expected to get adverse reactions.  It IS understandable though that you need to vent, but to expect to get a decent opinion in an open channel is an invitation to blunt criticism.  That's just the risk.  You took it, so you got an obvious answer from someone else.<P>* Obviously this person is another member of the "Verant Arse Kissing Guild". His further comments only served to make me a wee bit mad as he told me "you only have the right to play the game" after I had stated that I am paying a monthly fee for this game and should have at least some say in it. I sure wish I could tell my customers that "hey bud you only have the right to expect what I'm giving you and thats that now piss off and be a good little customer" at this I was told "different business". Hmmm, strange comment from people that live in a country that can sue a company for making coffee too hot.*<P>I'll disregard the "Verant Arse kissing guild" statement and move on.  You're pretty much right on this post.  Even though WE THE CUSTOMER are in "Their World" we do have a say in the matter since even though we play by their rules.  However what does this have to do with the April Fools Joke? <P>Nothing.<P>*Don't get me wrong I love playing EQ, hell it's the only game I ever play anymore, but my love for it stems for the fact it's the closest thing I can get to AD&D now and the fact that I have made many good friends on the Tunare server. But even in AD&D a GOOD GM would always make sure you enjoyed the game even if you died. A good GM would always at least give you a "percieved ownership" over the game even though he or she was the one in total control. People concentrate on the numbers because thats what they are playing for, they are trying to accomplish something. Whether it be new armor or a new magical sword they want it and they want to have fun getting it but at the same time don't want to feel like they are just in a large chat room with a few other things to do. Do professional sports players risk injury to go out into the field "just to have fun"? Of course not they go out to win, if not they get their salaries lowered or traded. Albeit EQ is just a silly computer game but that does not mean that there should be no sense of accomplshiment for the player.*<P>There IS a sense of accomplishment in EQ.  It's just on a different level.  PnP D&D was fun because it was on a personal level.  One GM weaving a world and telling it to you via mouth while the party members did anything and everything they could in it.  It had infinite possibilities.  With EQ it's the sense of victory when defeating Vox, or gaining one of the best weapons in the game after camping it endless hours... etc etc <P>*As far as knowing something about programming, I do and true the changes made where probably simple data table changes, however having worked as an engineer for over 3 years now I also know the "god like" attitude most programming engineers have and it seems to me that it is not entriely unreasonable to assume that these changes where being made to "make the expansion pack look better" under the guidence of the "Evil Marketing Department". After all there is some superb programming in the game but there is also some very lazy programming in the game such as why is a Druids speed spell (sow) the same as lets say a Troll shamans speed spell (again sow)? Trolls would not have developed a spell for a creature not indigenous to their homeland. But it's a matter of convenience and I understand that so it goes to say that instead of creating a brand new bunch of great and fabulous spells for the expansion set why not just take the old ones and make them better and more powerfull, this is a practice commonly used in this field whether for business or for gaming.*<P>As said again, it's a Joke.  So none of these evil tactics will make it live.<P>AS for the 'common practice' thing, it would take double the time to actually implement the idea of the new spell and test it out for game balance, which would in the end, delay the release of RoK<P><BR>I have no doubt that the people at Verant are very good at what they do and are dedicated to the game however they have yet to prove their dedication to their customers and that is the feeling I have got from many of the so called "whining" posts here and elsewhere. And for all the people that say "stop complaining" well after 30+ years on this planet I have noticed one thing (and yes I've worked in Customer Service too) that it's the ones that complain and ***** and scream that get things changed and get there orders delivered on time not the panzy pascifists who sit and politley agree with everything in hopes of getting something for nothing.<P>Pansy pascifists huh? <BR>How much dedication do you want from Verant?  I don't care if you've worked in every field in the damn business in this forsaken world, but from what I do know it's pretty hard to run a damn world.  You're "experience" is only taken from specific points of view... ie marketing, customer service, etc.  Combine all of those and and more and you have a company like Verant, who has to deal with this day in and out.  <P>Haven't they changed a lot since then? YES<BR>A lot those changes were pretty much good.<P>I could go on and on, however I hope you see my point.<P>Maybe it was a joke but the joke is now on Verant as this appears to have put more strain on their relationship with their "serious" customers. A relationship that is already linked by a tiny weak thread that is about to break.<P>How so?  Maybe if the joke WASN'T a joke it would make sense.<P>I thank Verant for the game and "allowing" me to play it, I have enjoyed my time on it vastly and will still continue to play to try and have fun but if the game gets any harder than it already is, what with overcrowding and not being able to find a group (ever try and solo a Wizzard?) and the new "Play Nice" rules forcing a lot of players to keep groups small for more exp (where is that full group bonus anyway???) I will probably quit playing myself leaving EQ to the "Verant Arse Kissing Guild" player and the casual "I don't know D&D from Asteroids" players.<P>Game getting harder? Isn't that a given considering that the higher level you are, the harder it is to level????<P>Solo a wizard? It can be done.  HIgher on up it'll be really hard and tedious rather than grouping up.  <P>All I have to say is that I hope you find happiness elsewhere (maybe AC?).  You ARE a paying customer and are free to leave anytime.  <P>In the end though, no real harm was done unless you were testing on the Test Server or were parsing.  It was a well planned joke, so at least take it with a grain of salt and go play =P<P>playerwhocantakeajoke<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000612.cgi&ReplyNum=000228&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Spell+Nerfing+-+All+Read">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>The problem was not the joke, the problem is that Verant's history is the joke.  They may have meant to be funny... ha ha. But, what everything in thier 'joke' is something that have done in the past, will do in the future.<P>If they had the trust of the player base instead of hate, then it would have been funny.  EQ will die quicker than UO did when a replacement is released.  You may say good riddance, more for me, hoorayyy your gone, just be sure you turn out the lights when you learn your the last one on.  Logging onto 1 of the last 5 servers with only 100 folks online may sound like fun, but who arte you going to tell for help? or sell things to? or group with?  numbers count.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000612.cgi&ReplyNum=000229&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Spell+Nerfing+-+All+Read">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>GZ made the changes on Test Server as part of the joke.  Changing the file and not changing the Test Server code doesn't make it look real enough, thus not believable enough.  The posts simply would have turned more into confusion than anything, more like 'Hey GZ, does this file do anything anymore?  Nothing in it seems right.'  And unless the joke is upsetting, it's not worth doing on April Fool's.  And where I come from it lasts up to a week, so there's lots of fun, laughing, crying, and anguish.  If you don't like the harshness of the holiday, well, that's too bad for you since there's not much you can do to get rid of it. heh<P>I guess I have that programmer 'god syndrome'.  When people start screwing around with something I worked hard to keep working and SECRET, it pisses me off too, to the point of not trusting a darned soul anymore.<P>GZ?  Listening?  Just dump the flat file and store it all on a database.  It's obvious there are too many unprofessional geeks who got nothing better to do than screw with your work and make your life hell...and for what?  Just to give these shmuks a fun game to play?  They don't deserve it, and you don't deserve the BS.  And this isn't a** kissing.  This is my decade in the field of private software development, which has a lot more structured benefits than public software development (which is a ROUGH field).  People who mess with my work, I take them down a dozen notches till they feel like they don't exist anymore.  I don't know this GZ nor do I think I care to know (hey, buy me a bear and we can talk for hours, why not), but I think he's on the ball.<P>And anyone who doesn't feel like a god at their work, they need to get fired or transfered.  It's obvious they aren't into their work enough to give 100%.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000612.cgi&ReplyNum=000231&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Spell+Nerfing+-+All+Read">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Geesh, I wasn't taking it a seriously as some people where.<P>"Pansy pascifists huh? <BR>How much dedication do you want from Verant? I don't care if you've worked in every field in the damn business in this forsaken world, but from what I do know it's pretty hard to run a damn world. You're "experience" is only taken from specific points of view... ie marketing, customer service, etc. Combine all of those and and more and you have a company like Verant, who has to deal with this day in and out." <P>Hmmm, looks like your taking my post out of context totally, you're probably a reporter for your school newspaper.  I work in this business may not be gaming but it is still this business so my specific pov applies.<P>I was trying to point out like many of the posts here that people have and had EVERY reason to believe that this may not be a joke.  This was reinforced by Abashis' own statement...<P>"Bets on how many of these "joke" changes will actually be included in the new expansion, say within the first 4 months?"<P>"None. These were all done off the top of our heads over the course of about 10 minutes. We'd thought that a few people would get it as a joke considering that every magic-using class had one of their most valuable spells nerfed. I guess it was all entirely too plausible."<P>Shall I repeat in case your hard of reading?<P>"I guess it was all entirely too plausible."<P>"Entirely too plausible."  Thats from the horse mouth my "better than I am friend".<P>Hmmm, as far as being way out of line sorry all I see here is a bunch of people who had a reason to believe these changes may take effect and a MINORITY of people looking down there noses at them with the "HAHA I got the joke and you didn't so your stupid and I'm better than you are" attitude.  Typical human behaviour.<P>Tagging those who take a joke?  I'm not the one calling out peoples ego's and calling them schmucks and suckers?  Who tagged first?<P>*Having worked in many fields and Marketing being one of them I would have to believe that there is the possiblility that these changes where meant to "test" peoples reactions.*<P>"Not to sound mean, but wasn't that the intent? I seriously don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure that out."<P>Ahhh a true reporter take a snippit of a comment and rip it apart, TRUE propaganda at work.<P>"First thing off it WAS an April Fool's Joke. A lot of April Fool's Jokes aren't all that nice. They're pranks aimed at people, designed to get a laugh or two. This has nothing to do with Marketing."<P>Ok you've never worked in a development environment b4, if marketing has nothing to do with it why do program architects and develelopers spend more than 10 hours a week in meetings with them?  Guess it's just for the muffins and cofee.<P>"AS for the 'common practice' thing, it would take double the time to actually implement the idea of the new spell and test it out for game balance, which would in the end, delay the release of RoK"<P>Hmmm, pity so many complacent people are so willing to get rid of quality for quantity.  And again your taking a snippit out of a message that was meant to be read in it's entirety and blowing it out of proportion.  Funny how I'm supposed to "Combine all of those and and more and you have a company like Verant, who has to deal with this day in and out." and yet you can't read an entire message and take it in CONTEXT.<P>"All I have to say is that I hope you find happiness elsewhere (maybe AC?). You ARE a paying customer and are free to leave anytime." <P>This is exactly the type of comment that led me to post in the first place and say things like "Verant Arse Kissing Guild".  I never get down and dirty till someone else does first, and actually I have been considering other alternatives and as I said in my post which was not quoted by you "I enjoy playing the game" and I also praised the engineers for a good job done.  But quoting any of that would have made your post... well REDUNDENT.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000612.cgi&ReplyNum=000232&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Spell+Nerfing+-+All+Read">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>WOOHOO! Now this is the way to finish off the long day at the company. Thanks Verant for being HUMAN! hahaha!  <P>Ya know, I run my own company, I promote dress-down because I like to have fun and I like my employees to have fun.  Sure I could run it professionally and make everyone wear suits, but that just wouldn't be the image for my company. My company sells movies, do you watch movies in suits?<P>Now we have EQ, do you play EQ in a suit or do you wear whatever you want to? thought so, so now look at the big picture, Verant makes a GAME, the game is FUN, so the people need to be too.  Now if they made an accounting program, I would expect them to be strict non-fun suit-wearing businessman. But they are producing a rockin game, for people who like to have fun and play games. So now we can have no-holds barred jokes and fun because the people who buy their game want to have fun.  If you think verant needs to be "professional" go play with an accounting program, EQ isn't the fun your looking for in that case. Sure, the joke might have been in poor taste because of the upcomming kunark and the already hot nerfing issues, but I have to say damn it was good, it was a true-form computer nerd april fools joke!<P>Thank you for taking my 2 coppers.

</FONT><HR>OK I apologize for any comments I made that offended (but there is a difference between a "GOD" complex and liking what you do and doing it well).  What got me disgruntled was calling people shmucks because they expect some type of ethical customer service.<P>I honestly believe that Verant did it to try and strengthen a bond with the customers "Hey look were playing around with you just like one big happy family" but it's not one big happy family because they have upset people in the past.  Again I enjoy the game I'm not denying that. And Shok is right it is just a game but it is a game people are paying a monthly fee for so this will add to the edgyness of some players.  I know a lot of players and the way things are set up now good luck trying to get any good items out of the game.  Who the smeg has 6+ hours to camp a spawn for an item that could disapear the moment thier server makes you go LD?  You don't think this can be frustrating for some of these people who only have a few hours to play every other nite?  <P>Should a gaming company be as "professional" as Xerox or Smith-Kline Beechum?  Probably not because you'd get a game even more static than it is now. But let me ask you this, would Shok let someone walk into his office or store or whatever he has and let one of his employees perform a scene from Clerks in front of them? And then tell the customer "Hey if you wanted professional you should have gone with the guys at the store down the street".<P>All I was saying was that these people had a reason to believe and fear that these changes might actually occur and for that they got called stupid, niave and "schmucks". Why is it some people have to be better than others in order to pacify some underlying pscychosis?  I don't want to be better than anyone, I just want to get along with everyone I can and feel normal but when people bite first I bite back that was not always my nature but being complacent, I have found, gets you nowhere fast.<P>Your right I am no one to downsize anyones ego no matter how overly inflated it may be but I'm also not calling people scmucks.<P>If anyone had bothered to read my first message in it's entirety and taken it in context than they would have understood what I was saying and not what they wanted to percieve I was saying.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000612.cgi&ReplyNum=000237&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Spell+Nerfing+-+All+Read">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

I love some of those bug fixes where a total of 3 seconds was spent on a fix that simply made things far worse and had to be fixed again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000612.cgi&ReplyNum=000238&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Spell+Nerfing+-+All+Read">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>The people that got upset need to get real. First you are decompiling the program in a basic sense to parse the file. This is illegal. Second the spells do not get determined by the client side data they get determined by SERVER side data. Verant has stated many times that some of the information in the file is flat out FAKE yet all you schmucks take someone who is doing something illegal as the headspeaker for what is really happening. The people parsing this file haven't seen the source code they have NO idea what client side data does what and what is server side. Personally I think the people writing the parser programs need to spend their time more constructively writing thier own software to sell. It is just like UO the people that programmed the UO Emulator could have simply programmed thier own MMORPG and raked in some money instead they would rather decompile and backengineer someone else's work.<P>Sadil</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000612.cgi&ReplyNum=000240&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Spell+Nerfing+-+All+Read">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Great more smuck comments.<P>I'm wondering how many of these "coders" learnt their trade, from what I'm reading I'm led to believe that the great gods of COBAL, BASIC and C+ came to them in a vision of a burning bush and instilled in them in a moment of clarity the all powerfull knowledge of programming.<P>Get real you learnt your trade the same way the rest of us did by reading other peoples code and if you didn't your not much of a coder.  Just parsing a file is not illegal, parsing the file and changing the code or copying it, thats illegal.<P>Backengineering? There are entire clean rooms in silicon valley dedicated to this. Or maybe it's only right or legal when you have corporate lawyers watching your back? Funny how if Microsoft backengineers a Mac interface they are declared heros but if two guys do it out of their own home they are hacker scum.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000612.cgi&ReplyNum=000242&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Spell+Nerfing+-+All+Read">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000612&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000612&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
