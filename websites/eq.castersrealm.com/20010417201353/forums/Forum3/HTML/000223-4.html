</FONT><HR>In all honesty, the enchanter pet was never meant to be as important as a necromancer or a magician pet.  He is merely an accessory and the true strengths of the enchanter is to buff, debuff, and crowd control.  He is supposed to control the situation, yet he cannot control hit pet.  The enchanter belongs in a group, he is practically the cornerstone.  The "nerf" shouldn't matter to a real enchanter who knows how to do his job and actually play his class.<P>Irba Ghez'unan.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000075&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Yep, necros are getting an 800dmg version of the enchanter lvl49 DoT. The only difference is that it debuffs AC not agi like the 600dmg enchanter version. <P>Worst of all the are getting a resistance debuff and a TWO targetable mana regen spells. <P>The mana spell trades 200 mana to another player 60 mana. (piss poor by the way). The other transfers 100mana to another players.<P>So necros can now debuff str & AC, debuff fire/poison/disease, heal, mez, speed pet to SLTW speed, and mana regen others. Does anyone think this might be getting into the enchanter role a litte?<P>oh yeah, they can do about 3000dmg with all of thier dots stacked.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000077&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>First off, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome all you poor enchanters to the continuous hell that is being a necromancer. That being said, I am NOT going to jump on this bandwagon and applaud Verant for either this nerf or their lack of compassion about it. As you should know, necro's have been down this road many a time (14 nerfs in 6 months) and rarely does anyone defend us (Necro's are already gods! NERF 'EM AGAIN!). But I digress.<P>I really hate to break this to you, but protest all you want, Verant WILL NOT reverse this nerf, will not enhance enchanters, nor pay this issue any more mind. Organize your mass emails, your sit-in's and everything else. It will be nothing that Druids (the pioneer of the nerf) or Necro's have not done before.<P>All in all, you guys got the shaft. Believe it or not, this "nerf" was inadvertant, or rather indirectly effected Necro's as well. Hey, you gotta roll with the punches. Suck it up, you are still a great class (sorry, couldn't really resist). In short, you got the shaft and nothing is going to change that.<P>As for necro's pets not being as big of nerf, how many have played necro's that claim this. If we stack DOTs, we can do over 5k damage to a MOB. So why don't necro's stack DOTs? Because in a previous adjustment (August nerf) a code was introduced that as soon as a necro stacks two DOTs, the MOB is after him and fact is, the pet will not taunt it off. As for the fact that our pets are superior, they have both ZERO AC and MR. Oh, well, welcome to the wonderful world of nerfs.<P>Maybe next time a class is on the chopping block, there might be a bit of compassion.<P>Procyon<BR>Mith Marr<BR>Retired with 70+ days played.<P>PS - It's nice to see that Enchanters and Necros are going to be so similar now. We're getting away to rush mana regen (imagine the mana transfer when a necro has Lich on. Oooooo) and our ST is a beginning crowd control. Heh, never thought I'd see the day I had anything in common with Enchanters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000078&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Thanks a lot, Pithello, for telling me what my 'job' as an enchanter is.  I'm so glad I have geniuses like yourself to stereotype my class for me, ignore half of the enchanter abilities, and tell me that as an enchanter, I have only one 'job'.  Oh, and thanks for telling me that because I have soloed a lot with my animation (never again, it would seem), that I'm no good at playing my class.  And thanks to all of you geniuses out there who are reminding the rest of us stupid people who are no good at playing an enchanter that we never deserved to have an animation in the first place, so we haven't lost anything.<P>Maybe you should step outside of the little room you camp in every day, and see that there is a world outside!  There are even things to do in it that don't involve sitting on your ass for hours on end, then telling others that they're poor enchanters if they don't do what you do!  Enchanters USED to be good at many of those things...<P><BR>Landros Simulacre<BR>Disenchanted, stereotyped, and apparently not a very good level 39 enchanter on Mithaniel Marr<P><BR>P.S.

</FONT><HR>I can't believe what I'm hearing.  <P>Yet there it is. <P>"We're upset because a BROKEN rule got FIXED, and now the loophole we used is closed."<P>Yes, you no longer have the spinning-ginsu damage machine pet you once did.  You can't take two magician daggers and have a pet that dishes at a phenomenal speed.  You now have the personal guard and attendant you needed for while you're buffing and ENCHANTING things.<P>Get over yourself.  Jeez.  Did you really choose to be an enchanter because of the super damage pet?  Because of your nuking ability?  Because of the cool lifetaps?  Why did you choose this class?<P>If you said no, no, no, and umm...then maybe you need to think it over a bit.  <P>Need I remind you that you will NEVER see a magician over 20th level having a pet that is of a level equal to or greater than himself?  And yet occasionally you'll see a necro, and quite often you'll see an enchanter CHARM a high-level mob among the pull and turn it on it's fellows.  <P>Quite impressive.  I was envious.  Like the enchanters I've seen, I wouldn't do it without a group or a zone to back me up, but it certainly doesn't suck.<P>And as far as your pets go, I agree - when compared to necros and magicians.  Their pets are more controllable, and in the case of magician pets, will kick an animation's butt now.  Not by much, but chances are high the mag's pet will win.  When considered by themselves, I think they're a great addition - and a needed damage bonus in a tough fight.<P>Just don't expect it to go toe-to-toe with a magician in a duel.  That's not what it was designed for.<P>  D<P>------------------<BR>Durash of Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000083&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I don't use my pet often, only outdoors and only when my tanks are untrained.<BR>My big concern is the total unbalance these changes have made to 2 classes in the game. From what I can see a bug that was introduced from day one of the game, balanced out the mage class and necros, and made some NPC's ( those that were supposed to have duel attack) combatable.<P>Verant obviously thought there was something lacking in the pets of Mages or they wouldn't have included those wonderful new toys that enhance their pets. But they fixed that by adding these new toys, didn't they.<P>As Verant has said continually the classes are pretty well balanced and no major changes were going to be made. Just some tweaking. <P>I didn't agree with that before and I certainly don't now. To me, it seems that the designer(s) with the loudest mouth in the design meeting(s) is/are getting their pet class(es) (pun not intended)looked at before any of the other classes or QUESTS that need work. <P>Quests are the most broken thing about evercamp.

</FONT><HR>Many people think that enchanter is one of the best class.  My answer is a NO.  Enchanter is really sux.  Why?<BR>1) our nukes suck.  You know, mega taunt, not mana efficient.  Very little damage.<BR>2) our DOT suck.  Both necro and shaman's DOT are way better then ours.<BR>3) our debuff suck.  Shaman's debuff is way more powerfull then us.  I can tell the different between a completely debuffed mob and a normal mob.  But, until we cast two debuffs on it (and not resisted).  It's almost dead already.  So, they are kinda useless.<BR>4) our quickness spells suck.  Check this out <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum12/HTML/000362.html." TARGET=_blank>http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum12/HTML/000362.html.</A>   Shaman's haste is way better<BR>5) our pets suck.  Even before nurf.  In my opinion, our pets are useless.  When in group, enchanter's pet = break mez (which means die).  Solo? don't even think about it after the nurf.<BR>6) illusions suck.  Totally useless, only for fun.  We can definitly live without them.  And those people with guise of deciever are sharing our fun.<BR>7) sense magic, identify.  What the hell are they.  What for?<P><BR>What's left?  Well, clarity, slow spells, AE stun, Mez, Jewelcraft<BR>Clarity is cool, but then we can't solo.  Clarity is just making our group member happier.<BR>Slow spells are cool, but then we can't solo.  Slow spells are just making our tank happier.  (Shaman have the same spells)<BR>AE Stuns are cool, but then we can't solo.  AE Stuns are just making our Evac'ers happier to buying them more time to cast evac and make healers happier by buying them some time to heal.  (many other classes can stun too)<BR>Mez is cool, but then we can't solo.  Mez is just making our group happier by taking more mobs at a time.  (necro can mez now)<BR>Jewelcrafter is cool, but then pp is worthless.  Jewelcraft is just making twinker happier.  <P>Is enchanter unique?  NO.  We are good at nothing.  Nothing at all other then clarity.<P>Why people think enchanter is one of the best class in Everquest? cux they are very happy when grouping with an enchanter.  Everyone is happy.  Come on Varent, we are just helping you to make your customer happier.  Why nurfing us.<P>Back to the pet's issue.  Our pets are weak enough before nurf.  The weakest part of our pet is, "we can't control it".  By making our pet uncontrolable, our pets are already the weakest pet between necro and mage (no to mention the hp of our pet)  Many enchanter don't feel like using our animation even before the nurf.  Our pet is our ONLY HOPE to solo before nurf.  Why takig away our only chance to solo.<P>I don't know why varent named us as Enchanter, they should call us "clarity provider".  That's it, we are nothing but the provider of clarity.  Every single class is unique other then enchanter.  And what the hell is Robe of Ishva.  Aren't the blue/black looks suppose to be unique for enchanter.

</FONT><HR>Durash,<P>I think there's an underlying problem with the conclusion you draw in your post, and it's rooted in this entire weapon/speed issue wrt pets and the assumption it was in fact a "bug" as Abashi et al claim. That's a convenient fiction on their part and I don't buy a word of it.<P>What did happen was there was a problem with their code regarding Magician pets...someone at Verant central dropped the ball long ago. The quickest and easiest fix they could find involved a widespread nerf to all pets. Worth noting that doesn't mean that is the "best" fix...far from it. <P>All this subsequent talk by Abashi of it being a "bug" and "they're so happy" we found it for them (blah blah) is just so much spin-doctoring meant to mislead and deflect critiscism. <P>_If_ necro pets were supposed to be a runnerup to magician pets (i.e. this truly is a "bug" and thus its correction restores balance) then why did Necros receive some _very_ substance compensation for the change to their pets? Whatever they lost was more than gained back with the additions given them in spells. Hence this mythical balance that was so briefly obtained is once again lost.<P>Following from that the question is begged...If Necro's were that significantly damaged by the speed nerf to require a substantive addition to their spell repetoire, how sits the Enchanter in this equation? His pet was marginal at best to begin with. It is now a waste of 1sp for the Tiny Daggers.<P>Necros, imo, come out ahead of the deal when you look at their compensation. Magicians do as well obviously. Enchanters, however, are the big loosers. And the insulting part here is it has nothing to do with Abashi's false claim of bug squashing and a return to the way things should be. He's feeding folks a pile on this one. The scariest part of the entire fiasco is the amount of people buying into it.<P>Sophist</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000086&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>A little bit on the pets.<BR>In the difficult levels before, MOST of the damage i did to a mob in any situation (solo, or grouping) was via the pet, for i simple reason:<BR>  At lvl 23 i was using a lvl 8 dot (what 80 damage? yippee!), and a lvl 16 highly resisted DD. At 28 i was STILL using that lvl 8 dot (granted, i had a new dd, but still...).<P>The bottom line is the pets being slowed hurt most those levels where grouping is tough to accomplish, and during those levels we are using vastly outdated spells to try and kill whatever mob we are facing. It is most readily apparent soloing, but groupng as well. Yes its a group oriented game, but it is just plain stupid to assume EVERYONE can find a group WHENEVER they want. The dagger trick allowed us to use our frail, stupid animations to some effect, making those occasions when we HAVE to solo feasable. Now that ability has been lessened.<P>My biggest problem with the whole situation is the initial disregard of the other pet classes, and the "Oh, well! We're happy." response to our outrage.<P>W were a quiet class, because, generally, we were a happy, fairly well-balanced class. The one occasion i have seen an outcry this large, Verants response is, at best, laced with apathy.<P>There's something very wrong with that.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000087&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>First of all let me address some points you all made: 1. we suck at solo; 2. we or our pets were overpowered; 3. our spells.<P>Anyway, what's his name says he likes the balance now with the pets.  He is full of himself.  He hasn't even taken a look at enchanter pets.  He has no clue about enchanter pets.  He didn't have a clue about mage pets.  I still and have solo'd, lvl 34 now.  after the patch i gave my pet 2 daggers and went after avocets.  I died once and had to zone the other times too. pet fully buffed me fully buffed.  Now here's a tidbit too.  My mez was resisted by the avo's.  this has never, ever happened before. every time i mezed them they resissted. EVERY TIME. ok test that and prove me right.  He fails to understand how the lack of hp of our pets and now the lack of delay affects our pets.  We can't stack augment with a celerity line spell.  it is better to augment your pet than to celerity your pet, if you are a true solo'er.  if you are gonna solo you get a good blue pet buffed and go for hours. well the avo's ruined me and my pet, with my runes on both of us.  furthermore it resisted far more everything i casted on it, i was oom by the time it killed my pet.  I used to use avos before with a druid and my pet.  and hte only thing the druid did was blast the avo.  <P>&lt;p&gt;I solo still and we can solo beyond lvl 20, don't let anyone tell you different.  Our pets never was, and still is not FRIGGIN OVERPOWERED.  Whomever even suggests that is on crack.  I say take the pet away completely and give us something really useful. charm at 1st lvl and make it reliable.  I heard in beta all our spells were really effective and lasted a long time, ie. whirl till you hurl.<P>&lt;p&gt;our spells suck.  we are ineffective in the planes. ALL WE ARE USED FOR IN THE PLANES IS CLARITY. surprised? debuffs are a joke and tashani is practically useless since wizards got their spell resists reduced anyway.  face it after lvl 46 everyone is going to the planes.  would you want a useless class there? there are still manastones, and now the wizard rod of modulation, who needs a silly enchanter there, they take up space for a cleric or warrior.<P>&lt;p&gt; i told my friends and this just proves it, we don't complain. we don't make a fuss, because this class is so hard just to understand what we are doing we don't realize when we are being nerfed.  And we don't know what to suggest to improve us.  I say give us back all the spell durations and effects as they were in beta. i.e. effective debuffs, and effective dependable durations.  charm should be based on a straight charisma and skill versus the mobs resist. no need for caps. if you do that you can totally lose the pet. yes the pet gets us and whole parties killed quite often.  i only cast pets in dungeons as a speed bump for me gating.  the pet is ineffective and was anyway, i only thought of it as a dot spell anyway.  there is no way that the enchanter pet can compare to ANY of the other pets, including shamans, and shadow knights.  i am angry also that they interupted PRIME FRIGGIN TIME for an emergency nerf.  it took me out of the game then it took me a long time just to log into the login server, 2 hours wasted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000088&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

Mainly to clear up some confusions I don't want to see muddling the arguement.<P>Firstly, the assumption you make that makes all your other points mote.  Pets are not just for soloing.  Everyone screams "Enchanters are for crowd control".  What sort of crowd control are we suppose to do when fighting a single mob?  (dragons, gods, plane mobs a lot of the time...)  <P>Secondly, a 49 pet, does NOT hit for 60.  I think its actually closer to 45, but not %100 sure.  It does, however, quad-attack with bash and kick.  Swift on top of that lends to some nasty damage, but his lack of hps and AC will get him dropped fast and therefor loose in overall damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000089&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>ttheobald:  I don't think you understand.  Yes charm is awesome when it works right (and it does &lt;40 sometimes), but your pet never turns on you as a mage unless you hit it...and even then, you have /pet back off.  Charm is VERY risky.....you don't know till you try it, so don't pretend you do.  I could not make effective use of chariming until 24 (thats 12 levels after getting it).  It just would NOT last long enough.  I even practiced on bats to make sure I was doing it right.   Tashani a bat, charm it, sick it on another bat, and now fighting 2 bats....hmmm glad that wasn't a pair of griffawns.<BR>We NEVER expected our pets to outperform amges are necros.  We want them to outdo a @#%! shadowknights though, especially if he's 10 levels lower than we are.  I think that is VERY fair.<BR>Hell, it was a mistake that we got caught in this thing anyway...this patch was to balance NECROS AND MAGES...it should not have affected us at all.  Then they realized it did and said 'oh, we meant to do that.' Because Verant doesn't do well admitting mistakes (I'm surprised they did not try to blame this nerf on my ISP too).<BR>Now we want it fixed...get over yourself...you've got a fix for two of the major issues with your class...leave us alone while we try to get something about ours fixed.<P>Leirra</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000090&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Im angry, yup im very very mad. I cant believe the carelessness that abashi's comments implied. Or Brad's either.  I truly cant belive they would be so insensitive to consumers needs.  Truly whether they meant to do it or not, they honestly totally lost a huge chunk of my respect by being so blase about this.  <BR>I read every single post on the way to the bottom. i wonder if anyone at verant will.<P>Well hello Mr McQuaid heres some info for you. Enchanters can solo. yup even after the nerf we can solo and no matter what you do to me im going to solo. even if i have to solo greens. and you know why? because im tired of being a clarity machine, <P>Explain please why every class but enchanters that has a fear line also has a slow line? we have a useless encumberment spell that doesnt work on a lvl 1 spider. no not even the lvl 44 version. and yes, i tested it.  If i stack my highest lvl dot at lvl 45 and my encumber and the int lowering spell + shiftless deeds upon myself im more than slowed. i can barely walk. but why is it when i stack all these spells on a sand giant or say a cyclops or an avocet etc etc i get very very little results? Shiftless deeds actually does something btw. i like it.<P>If charm is my big strong suit then why when i charmed something blue &lt;low blue even&gt; that hits for 90 and another thing that hits for 116 damage it lasted for like maybe 1.5 min tops. at which point i had 2 dynamic hitting mobs after me.<P>Then i tried a pet on alacrity the ac buff str buff and the flameshield that we get . all lvl 39-44 versions. Pet got the low blue mob down 1 whole bubble before it got mashed then said mob came after me.<P>ok maybe i did it from the wrong perspective. so i tried it with ac/aug/berserker str/and flameshield... hmm still less than one bubble of damage to said mob.<P>ok maybe im trying the wrong mob.<BR>so i moved to a greenie room camp. mobs inside being 34 at the highest because none of them were blue to me. and none gave exp (high green) ok i did camp this same room a week ago with little problem. remember they are green to me. "this looks like it would be an easy battle"   pet with dagger and fully buffed &lt;yes i tried it both ways&gt; im thourough. i cant spell thou =P.<BR>the same room took poor Jarantik who was blue to me down to the j in his name ( fully buffed fully maximized, i tried him with both sets of buffs and with and without dagger. granted his name changed but.....  you get the idea.  <BR>Still maybe i am approaching this from a different view.  so i tried charming the first one up. bah gah and a big hooo rah to you guys at verant. i stood back so when the message that charm wore off came i could recharm but no dice. by the time i had charm almost casted i had 2 gobbies on me hitting me for 40s. i messed them yup and took them down one at a time. but still. i had half a bubble of health by the time i was done.<BR> <BR>Okies so today i tried the wiz trick of kiting said mob. erm.. nope that didnt work either. and yes i tried it 2 different ways.<P>ok before the patch a necro pet could solo an ice giant with much help from a lvl 50 necro master. now? now... hmm now necros are resorting to the same reverse kiting that enchanters have dealt with since the beginning.   A mage can 2 if hes a good player and works hard. but an enchanter? no way.not even if we are top flight. <P>Once agian i want to thank verant for making me defined by charming something in lguk thats packed balls to the walls. and Sol b packed the same way &lt;lets hope i can get a group there&gt;. woohoo your world is turning into High keep all over the place. Joy and rapture to the gms and guides.   <P>Im truly disgusted and disenchanted and yup hurt by your disregard for your players. Ok Maybe my $9 a month and $50 origional output for fun and relaxation just didnt get it.. but why should i bother getting your $50 expansion pack just to be disrespected some  more?. duno.. you tell me.<P>"your in our world now" um hm. yup i can see that. unfortunately i dont like your careless attitude.  Truly if i lived in an apartment with a landlord this ... irresponsible with my sink leaking and my potty falling throu the floor, my stair rail breaking and my windows slowly sliding down the side of my house.. I think i'd move.<P>"goes off to play the cleric" or maybe ill just go join a group to shapeshift for their amusement. hmmm...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000093&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Man, WTF are you all complaining about?  Your pet used to do more damage than a warrior, and now it is back to being fair with melee clases. Enchanters main role is buff/debuff clarity everyone and crowd control. You also wanna deal great damage with pets? You wanna a resurect spell and ice comet too? GEEZ. Pets are where Verant wanted them. It is not a nerf, it is a bug fix. Look at it like it is.

After seeing them in black and white thou =( god im depressed.  Maybe a week long sit in is necessary.  no not a server crash, verant is challenged enough on that score. Perhaps if all the necros and enchanters let our accounts lapse for a whole week &lt;groans and holds your hands&gt; yes you can live without eq for a whole week.

</FONT><HR>DO you want Verant to listen to you? Do you want others to tell Verant how unhappy they are that you're class is nerfed? Do you want some sort of recompense for the abilities taken away from you? Do you want the broken spells addressed? Do you want the useless spell lines addressed? All you have to do is deny all those addicts out there their crack. Don't cast on anyone not in your guild or your group. I hesitate to call for a total ban on casting Clarity or Augmentation, since that would cause a serious problem if you continue to play. But if you simply refuse to cast those two spells for a single day, Thursday the third of February for instance, our voices will be heard. We are few in number but we have a vast populace that depends on our services. How many times have you cast on request? How many times have you cast on a whim, gifting a stranger with the gift of clarity? Are they grateful? Do they ask if there is anything they might do for you? Now there is. Feedback. Enchanters need to be "tuned". Our broken, useless, and unimplemented spell lines need to be fixed, replaced or upgraded. If we, as a community, stand together, they will have to listen. If you wish to be relegated to the role of crack dealer once you get to the top, by all means do nothing. If you wish to take your rightful place as the masters of the powers of the mind then make a stand. For 24 hours, from 0000 hours on 02/03/2000 until the same time 02/04/2000, do not cast clarity on anyone not in your group or guild. To prevent total resentment toward the enchanter community I would suggest that you use your local time. This will provide for some casting to go on but an actual 48 hour protest. I will also post this suggestion on other boards and urge all of the rest of you to do likewise. Remember no clarity or speed buffs. Encourage the disgruntled crack addict to feedback on your behalf. Solidarity is the key to winning this battle. Don't let your fellow enchanters down.<P>Samedii<BR>&lt;Rodcet Nife&gt; </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000223.cgi&ReplyNum=000096&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Enchanter+Pets+Ignored.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>It is time for the Enchanters to unite and protest as a group.. for some reason unclear to me the powers that be continue to strengthen the Necro class and do nothing to assist the Enchanters.. a Necro friend of mine can solo (with a pet) mobs yellow to him, that are blue to me and solidly kick my butt even when I fight with a pet.  I like my Enchanter but Im getting tired of having my face rubbed in it. When was the last time anyting at all was done to help solo gameplay... I know we are best in a group but until we reach a level to where we can travel to the dangerous areas to fight in a group we are totally screwed compared to every other casting class there it....
