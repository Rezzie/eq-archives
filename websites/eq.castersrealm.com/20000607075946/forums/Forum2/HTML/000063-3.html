</FONT><HR>Hi, i'm a level 46 enchanter and i've seen a lot in the game (62+ days of playing time) and read a lot  of message boards.  Here's my take on the issue:  <P>(1)Wizards shouldn't be able to solo like a mage or a necro because as has been stated these two classes are pet classes and are designed to solo from level 1 onwards.  <BR>(2) On a more positive note, I do feel that wizards shouldn't be jipped on damage spells and would have NO problem with higher level wizard spells doing more damage and being resisted less - AND MUCH LESS WITH TASHANIA (which I would like to see be made stronger: say -90 magic resist at 50). <P>By the way, it is my opinion that wizards have so many problems with the dragons and planes because of the fact that malosi is resisted so often on these things so a wizard is using a fire or ice spell on something with full resist to fire or ice when only its magic resistance has been lowered by the enchanter.  Get malosi to be unresistable like Tashania - it costs enough mana!  <P><BR>The ideal changes would look like: [same mana btw] Rend at 1000-1200 damage; IC at 1500-1800(is it magic based or cold based?.  With tashania and maolosi, a 50 wizard would be doing full damage with his spells 80%-90% of the time. This would make sure that wizards were the masters of offensive damage, and give them the characters they thought they had started at level 1.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000063.cgi&ReplyNum=000050&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=The+|QUT|Real|QUS||QUT|+Issue+with+wizards,+and+the+problem+with+their+1+dimensionality...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>rend is magic, comet is cold.<P>Problem with making Tashania -90 is that when the expansion comes out, then the level 74 spell Tashaniaolionalamunda is gonna have to be -300 or whatever which seems silly. (and rightfully so)<P>Wizard damage to dragons is fine imho. My spell damage to vox on the last raid (1614 points) was right on par with a level 46 monk with SLW, and I didn't even use all my mana, only 2/3. Our #1 damage was a necro pet, which did almost 4k, followed closely by our 50 ranger with a mistwalker and flux bladed axe who hit for 3800.<P>On Nagafen, similar story. 5 ice comets casted, 1 went for full, 2 partials (approx 300 each), and 2 full resists. About 1700 damage on that raid, which is also fine with me.<P>I guess my frustration comes when I need to deal with a room full of greens and it uses all my mana if i can kill them at all, while a pet class can clean the room with 0 mana used and pet at 85%<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000063.cgi&ReplyNum=000051&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=The+|QUT|Real|QUS||QUT|+Issue+with+wizards,+and+the+problem+with+their+1+dimensionality...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think I see the problem here. They restrict super healing to clerics only. All other decent healing classes (Druid,Shaman,Paliden) get it at 50%, and do not get the ooc full heal or group heal.<P>Wizards by that stratigy should get direct damage at double of the other classes. Realistically they do not burn better than Druids or Magicians.<P>Druids also get teleport so there is no real reason to require a wizard in the party like clerics which you (artifically due to healing caps on other healers) need.<P>I really do not think its wizards are bad. Just a few other classes are a better more complete package. <P>Still I think they could do a few things for wizards.<P>1) Huge AOE effect that slays green critters dead<P>2) Summon player (with consent)<P>3) Instant group ports to a random zone edge<P>4) summon back fleeing mobs<P>5) teleport away atacking mob (reverse shadow step)<P>They have not fully utilized them as masters of teleport in my opinion</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000063.cgi&ReplyNum=000052&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=The+|QUT|Real|QUS||QUT|+Issue+with+wizards,+and+the+problem+with+their+1+dimensionality...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well, everyone seems pretty well-thought out on this idea, after the initial flames died down.  But I think I am going to have to side with the wizards on this one.  Casting time and recasting time simply isn't important at level 50.  They could have a spell that couldn't be cast for another 30 seconds and be completely happy with it, because they have to wait that long before recasting in the first place.  Every comment made by GZ about casting time makes me wonder exactly how many group fights he has ever been in on dragon raids or planar fights.  here's a clue... no one in the group cares that a wizzie can burn all their mana in less than a minute.  Its a nice skill to be able to flout around, but for all common purposes, useless.  Everything at high levels is about efficiency, and if the lead designer of EQ can't figure that out, then maybe I, too, will go try ShadowBane when it comes out.  <P>ok, so everyone wants to say wizzies do all DD and all magik attacks.  Fine, make a &lt;b&gt;MORE EFFICIENT&lt;/b&gt; DD attack for them at high levels.  The idea a previous poster had about being able to link-cast a lower damage spell at a more efficient rate sounded like the best idea to me.  And another good idea I heard was the EXTREMELY large radius AE DD spells, though I would also add that those spells should be implemented in a way to make them agro the MOB a lot less of the time.  And that AE line of spells or spell would have to be VERY mana efficient, or you're going to end up pissing off the bard/enchanter in your group that had all the MOBs standing still.  <P>"But wait! That would make the Wizard a god class!"  <P>So? What exactly do you think a Necro is?  <P>"They could have a group of 5 wizards and a cleric just AE nuking everything to death!"  <P>Wow, just like a group of 6 Necros killing everything they want at will?  Simply put, nothing will make the Wizard a god class, because it will remain one-dimensional.  But making their spells more efficient so that they can fill their role at higher levels isn't going to hurt the game.  It will make the game better.  <P>Those are the primary things for battle.  <P>And on another note... Who cares if we kill dragons and gods? Its a game, and we want the exceptionally nice loot that those high level MOBs drop.  Its the only way to get it, so we do it.  <P>And if you believe that EQ is Duke Nukem in God-mode, you're playing it the wrong way.  The way I see it, EQ is the longest treasure hunt you can play with a bunch of your friends.  Some treasure is more valuable to you, some of it you can sell to others who want it.  Duke Nukem God-mode makes it so you get a BFG and go kill everything that you want.  Completely different premise from raising Wizard efficiency.  <P>But on the side of the other classes, Wizards shouldn't compare their DD spells to other DD spells, because they are still different.  Every Enchanter DD also casts a megataunt.  Lots of Cleric DD spells cast a stun, which adds to the taunt.  Magicians DD should be lowered at higher levels in my opinion, but their class should also gain more "focus" objects and spells to make up for it.  And Finally, Wizards Root should be changed in SOME way to make it more desirable than a snare from a Druid/Ranger.  <P>Other secondary issues that could make Wizards better at teleportation than Druids is to allow their evacs faster casting time than druids.  like a full second, not some 0.2 balogna.  The idea to summon players or MOBs sounded good to me, and another idea might be to allow wizards to cast a "shadow step" style spell on another team member, such as a Cleric or Enchanter that is getting banged up.  That alone would make them desirable, but who knows... that type of spell could become more of a double-edged sword than Charm is for Enchanters.  <P>Of course, these are all just secondary niceties that are thrown out.  The primary issue is with the &lt;i&gt;efficiency&lt;/i&gt; of Wizards in combat.  Right now there is none.<P>Meorah Chophen<BR>Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000063.cgi&ReplyNum=000053&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=The+|QUT|Real|QUS||QUT|+Issue+with+wizards,+and+the+problem+with+their+1+dimensionality...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

There is a class that can do both latter things.<P>Quote: Maybe wizards should be able to do enough damage that they can solo a dragon and get all the loot themselves<P> Well... I haven't heard any wizard asking for such. Where did you read long petitions asking for this?<P>Bunch of loot stealing kill stealing pull stealing charging too much for teleport one dimensional players.<P> Loot/Kill stealing... well. Wizard is almost the most poorly equipped to do this at 20+. (Of the 4 caster classes). And from 39 on, enchanters are masters of it, if they choose to be. It is funny to judge whole class by few rotten ones.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"> And as to the teleports, you can always ask druids, after all there are about 4x druids than wizards.<P>BR,<BR>MyztiC<P>PS. Give me 44th level PB AoE with 450sh damage, please!  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/wink.gif"> And preferably, magic based.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000063.cgi&ReplyNum=000055&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=The+|QUT|Real|QUS||QUT|+Issue+with+wizards,+and+the+problem+with+their+1+dimensionality...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum2/HTML/000063-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum2/HTML/000063.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum2/HTML/000063-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000063&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000063&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
