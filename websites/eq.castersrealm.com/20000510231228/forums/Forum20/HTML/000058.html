</FONT><HR>On various servers I have been playing an enchanter for about 6 months and a lot of that time was before I even discovered I could use daggers to augument my pets abilities.  After the most recent nerf, I will be putting my enchanter on the shelf until enchanters are addressed and compensated for their loss, but I would like to pass on some of the wisdom I gained in my time as an enchanter to help anyone new to the class.<P><B>Summon the best pet you can</B><P>I frequently see enchanters just summon a pet and go with it, I shake my head in sadness at this.  It may take a while to summon the best pet you can for your given level, but this is even more essential now than it was before.  A good pet will hit harder and with greater accuracy, have a few more hp, and have better ac.<P>Memorize your pet spell and reclaim energy.  Recalim energy is not incredibly effective, but we dont have a pet suicide command and its a lot quicker than zoning.  <P>When you reach a new spell circle, test your new pets on some green cons you know you can survive.  Take note of what the pet cons to you and what your max damage is after about 5-10 mins of use.  Do this a few times until you get an idea what your max damage pet cons to you and strive to get that con and damage each pet casting.<P><B>Always buff your pet</B><P>Strength is so cheap its laughable, and it actualy does seem to make your pet hit for max damage fairly frequently.<P>Your haze line does cost a bit more, but the duration is decent and seems to go up with level and every ac you can give your pet counts.<P>Your quickness line is significanly less cost effective, so you will need to weigh its benefit with how long you expect the fight to last.  At 18th it lasts about 4 minutes for me.  If I expect to be fighting 2 or more mobs consecutivly, I will use it.  If I will onyl be facing one mob, I'd rather save my mana for other spells.<P><B>Buffing yourslef</B><P>With the exeptions of short duration buffs, it is very helpfull to buff yourslef with the same buffs you give your pet.  While it does not hurt to have the buffs on yourslef, the main reason for this is to know when they wear off on your pet so you can keep it buffed.<P><B>Controlling your pulls</B><BR>(These tactics are targeted at solo play, but can be adjusted to grouping once you have a feel for your capabilities)<P>I look for camps that have no more than 3 mobs that con high blue or less.  You mgith be able to take even higher mobs, but at even and above, you will notice much more frequent resists and dying is somethign I'm hoping to help you avoid here.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>Once you have found such a camp, take note of if you are running distance of a zone or guard. <P>If you are in range of a zone or guard.<BR>Start with a lull line on the weakest con in the camp.  If it resists you will have the whole camp on you.  These spells have a VERY short duration, and not too reliable, so you need to act quick.  Next target the most powerfull mob in the camp and mez it.  If all goes as planned, you shold find the remaining mob charging at you for solo confrontation.  Be sure to back off a fair distance fromt he camp to deal with him outside of the camp agro range.<P>If you are NOT in zone or guard distance, you will need to be able to deal with a 2 on one charge.  These occasionaly result in death and are a lot more risky.  In thsi case, I mez the most powerfull mob in the camp with brings the 2 weaker ones at me.  I let one hit me to get my pet on it then back up to isolate the other one.  Once he is a perceptible distance from the one the pet is engaged in, root him (root casts quicker than mez) and back up.  At this point, you need to determine if your pet is in danger or not.  If your pet IS in danger, DoT or debuff the mob that is on him and tank for him (and pray that root lasts).  If he is not in danger, go ahead and mez the rooted mob then help out your pet.  After you finish off the initial mob, evaluate your mana.  If you have enough to finsih the seocnd mob, do so.  If you are low on mana, you should have tiem to run to guards or zone even if its a ways away.  If you were able to finish both mobs, CONGRATULATIONS on a successfull camp break up.  If you were not successfull, look for a slightly weaker camp and repeat.<P><B>Duo playing</B><P>While I despise grouping with large groups (chaos and disorganization are more hassle than they are worth), playing in a small 2 player group can be very beneficial.<P>If you are solo at a camp and a player within a reasonable level range approaches, or if you approach a camp with a solitary player, consider offering to group with them.<P>The tactics outlines above will work even better with someoen to back you up, and since if a pet does more than half the damage in a solo kill you only get half exp (which will usualy be the case), you do not loose on the exp end since pets in groups do not take nearly as much exp (the group bonus should nulify the pet loss).<P>Dual enchanters.<BR>Take advantage of being able to cast two mez spells at once!  <P>Enchanter and a mage or necro.<BR>Keep your own pets buffed as normal, but consider using your speed buffs on their pets instead of castign offensive spells.  You will be most effective as buff/debuff/crowd control here<P>Enchanter and wizard<BR>People say enchanters shouldnt nuke, but in this case you may want to consider it.  Aside to contributing some damage, your nukes will out taunt the wizards nukes and you have a pet to help out a bit too.  Rely on quick damage but a bit more downtime for mana.<P>Enchanter and Druid<BR>I havnt tried these tactics, so this one is theoretical.  Have the druid sow your pet and snare the mob.  Fear the mob and both you and the druid dot the mob.<P>Enchanter and cleric<BR>Another theoretical one.  Clerics are probably THE buff kings, so it would make sense that with their buffs, your pet might actualy compare with a mage or necro pet that can actualy tank for you while being a good DoT as well.  Assuming the pet is healable, this has a lot of potential.<P>Enchanter and shaman<BR>No experiece here, not even enough to get theoretical.<P>Enchanter and mele types<BR>When a mele type approaches a camp, I offer to let him take the ones that are green to me in a less traditional rotation.  If the mele type disagrees to this, I just sit back and let him try to take the whole camp by himslef, and when he gets himslef killed (even if the camp is already broken, mele downtime on anyoen other than a pladin will pretty much gaurantee that the camp will unbreak gradualy in their rest times (I might even buff him to give him a false sense of confidence and make him think I'm not as evil as I am)), then I resume my normal play (evil grin).<P><B>Some specific spots to try</B><P>The level listed is the minimum level I reccomend for trying these spots, but feel free to try earlier, or with a duo.<P>Level 4  <BR>Steamfont: kobold camps.  <BR>There is a camp near the newbie pits that has 3 in the camp and a solitary 4th one nearby.  The is antoher kobold camp further north you might want to try around lvl 6 (preferably with a duo as there are some higher mobs that will agro on you if they are near a fight).<P>Level 8<BR>Steamfont: By the windmills.<BR>This area is often but not always crowded.  You cna usualy find solo mobs that will give you some exp here.<P>Misty thicket: north side of the wall.<BR>If you have what it takes to endure the journey to get there, this is a wonderfull place to exp from about level 8 all the way upo 14th.  The actual camps here are more of a waste of time due to all the solo mobs wandering the area.  Only the gobs, YKs and the rare undead will agro on you if you stay clear of the camps.<P>Level 12<BR>Steamfont: dragon skeleton ruin.<BR>At the head end of the dragon skeleton is a solitary skeleton spawn.  If your not comfortable with the belwo strategy even that one spawn can be a good one.<P>At the tail end of the ruin, 3 skeletons spawn.  This is a dangerous pull, but it can be VERY rewardign exp wise if done correctly.  You are a fairly short runnign distance from the town guards, USE THIS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.  Summon a pet and mez one of the skeletons then IMMEDIATLY run to the guards.  If they do catch upto you, your pet shoudl help slow them down.  After the guards have killed your persuers, return to the camp and you should have one skeleton at the tail you shoudl be abel to dispatch and rest.  When the other 2 spawn mez one to get a 1 vs one confrontation and you will have broken the spawn.<P>Level 14<BR>Butcher block mountains:  Orc tower.<BR>Although there are 3 of them, there is a good chance of one of them being green at this level.  If they are all blue, simply forget about it, or look for a partner.  If one is green, mez one of the blues and the other blue should attakc with the green staying behind.<P>level 16<BR>Lesser faydark: the non-sister bandit camp.<BR>A similar approach to the orc camp above, but even if the green ones will occasionaly agro on a mez pull.  However, you should be strong enough at this point to handle a 2 on one.  Now if your mez happens to go bad (rare but I've had it happened), your essentialy dead.  On thsi camp I liek to keep color flux and gate memd when doign the intial pull.  If the pull goes bad,I can often save myslef by color flux and gate.<P>Level 18<BR>Rathe mountains: Orc camp by the paladins <BR>This is ONLY doable if you a good race.<BR>On thsi one we fallback to the skeleton strategy mentioned above.  One of the nice things bout this, is your only about a minute from a food/water/bandages vendor!<P>South Ro:  Western derv camp.<BR>A bit risky due to the wandering undead in the desert, but overall less difficult than the orc camp in rathe mountains.  A nice bonus here is that the derv thugs occasioanly drop pages for research (rare drop, but if the first time I've had the fortune of finding a mob I can solo that drops pages)<P>Good luck to you, I hope that these words will be of some help to the newer enchanters out there.<P>Fizzlezog of the nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=20&topic=000058.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Strategy+and+Tactics&TopicSubject=Fawewell+solo+tips+from+a+lvl+18+enchanter+(long+post).">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Dude<BR>your an enchanter, GROUP up.  TRUST ME, when you hit 20, you'll be on more people's friend lists than you could possibly keep on yours. If you wanted to solo, and stay anti-social, be a freakin necro, mage, or a druid.  Don't gripe about how much a grouping class sucks when your trying to solo.  If you have that much trouble getting people in your group to /assist then leave and find a group who wants to make more than a bub an hour of exp EASY. Were a tough class to play, but when you got it down right, YOU are the deciding factor in many fights.  Good luck.<BR>And shape up, or ship out.<P>------------------<BR>Cannial<BR>Enchanter of Quellios</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=20&topic=000058.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Strategy+and+Tactics&TopicSubject=Fawewell+solo+tips+from+a+lvl+18+enchanter+(long+post).">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I whole-heartily agree with Cannil.  Yes you can solo for fast xp, but what else does it get you?  You probably aren't going to get a Runed Cowl from Spectres, or a Shining Metallic Robe, or anything like that.  Join a group and go places.<P>I joined some groups and made good friends around 20th level, got levels fast cause I could always get into a group, and got good items from doing so.  For instance, I helped kill the Arch-Magi at level 34 and got the robes from him, you aren't going to do that soloing spectres.<P>But, for those of you who like sitting in one spot, day in and day out doing the same routine over and over again, I wish the best of luck to you.<P>------------------<BR>Calendria Cymorial<BR>Povar & the Nameless<BR>"When there's a will, there's an enchanter..."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=20&topic=000058.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Strategy+and+Tactics&TopicSubject=Fawewell+solo+tips+from+a+lvl+18+enchanter+(long+post).">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I was a soloist up until about 29th (grouped on several occassions but most of my time was spent soloing) not because I like doing the same thing day in and day out (LOL). <P>Often times I was in areas (Like the Hermit in SK) where there were other people as well. I would sit and chat with them and it was nice to actually have a few minutes to spare while they took thier turn at the spawn (I usually wasn't fully healed anyways). Also when I was out in Ocean of Tear fighting Alluring Sirens I found it quite adventuresome to be in the middle of enemy territory (I play on a PvP team server and I am a DE) and found it challenging to hid from the boat when it came by. In all the time I was out there no one ever saw me  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>I also solo'd the Tesch Mas Gnolls in SK for awhile and I enjoyed that alot. There is something to be said for self reliance.<P>My point? Well just because you enjoy grouping doesn't mean that soloing doesn't have it's own rewards. Try not to make us Soloists sound like a bunch of accountants. Plus it doesn't hurt matters that the experience is better.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>For the record these days I am always grouped with at least one or two other people. I have great conversations with them while we are hunting but I also had great conversations with these same people when I was soloing through /ooc, /tell and /guildsay statements. That's one of the reasons I group with them today  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=20&topic=000058.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Strategy+and+Tactics&TopicSubject=Fawewell+solo+tips+from+a+lvl+18+enchanter+(long+post).">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Not trying to break up a perfectly good argument, but ...<P>It's very good to be able to know how to both solo and group.  Sometimes you can't get a group, and sometimes you can't get a spawn.  Be flexible.  The guy is just offering advice to people who want the versatility.    <P>I prefer to group, but I solo when the opportunity presents itself.  At 27 I got INSANE exp soloing the TM Gnolls 2 pop.  I've never gotten faster exp anywhere in the game.  Risky?  Sure, but I've been in groups that were riskier.  At least while soloing you can control the risk and can zone with a clear conscience if it comes to that.<P>Why people feel the need to polarize these threads is beyond me.  The man wants to solo, let him know how to do it right.  Keep your "my way is the right way" opinions to yourself.<P>MrP</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=20&topic=000058.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Strategy+and+Tactics&TopicSubject=Fawewell+solo+tips+from+a+lvl+18+enchanter+(long+post).">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>You can solo an enchanter all the way up to 50 from what I hear but I know you can easy solo your enchanter up to level 24. I recommend a high elf enchanter because you get the natural Cha but does not matter to much. I have 2 enchanter's one level 35 on Rodcet and one level 25 on Cazic. The fastest way to level you enchanter is to group with one play I highly recommend a druid. Druids and enchanters compliment each other. But to solo from level 1-24 do the following up to level 12 stick with your newbie area then move to North Ro do taran and scarabs. Once you get level 12 you can solo derv camp one now this is risky but it is not that hard to do or you can head to west commons and do the wisps and yk found there. I recommend doing the dervs till level 16-17 they get boring but sure soloing is always a little boring just chat with the group. Next I recommend moving to Lake Rathe and from level 16 you can solo Jonah till level 18-20 he gives good exp. till level 18 and is not camped that often but is an option.  Next if you can get the camp avaik guard camp b1 you can stay there till level 24 and it is very easy you can also do any of the others camps solo once you get level 20-21 except the three bird spawn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=20&topic=000058.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Strategy+and+Tactics&TopicSubject=Fawewell+solo+tips+from+a+lvl+18+enchanter+(long+post).">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum20&number=20&thisthread=000058&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum20&number=20&thisthread=000058&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
