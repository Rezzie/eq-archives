</FONT><HR>I was once known as Ozzadyen a Senior Guide of Povar for a long time and Lanys T`Vyl for a very short time. I devoted almost a year of my time to helping others and giving them some enjoyment. I was released from the program for Improper behavior for going to the Arena and having fun with players on Lanys T`Vyl. <P>Now that I am no longer a part of the Everquest Guide program I can freely speak and I have every intention of doing so. First off Verant was on a Witch hunt to get me removed from the program anyway, because I was very unhappy with what had happened during the Rending of the Veil Part 4 on Xegony and let them know this. It was brought to my attention that there were 2 Councils on Xegony Councils of Light and Councils of Dark. On each of these councils were 5 players for a total of ten players. The Heads of these two councils were guides. At the end of the Veil 4 Quest a member on the Council of Light Allora was awarded the Title and Veeshan Claw. I found this very disturbing and wrong they have 10 Elite players on Xegony now and 1 was awarded a Title and an Artifact know as the Chyrstalline Claw of Veeshan. <P>Now while for the most part the Guide program is not to blame I will miss everyone there I worked with and knew for the last year. Go easy on those Guides, Apprentices and Seniors they are only doing what Verant directs them if they Deviate at all Like I did last night this is what happens to them. I have absolutely no respect for anyone at all in Verants upper Echelon, they rule with an Iron fist and use those in the Guide program without ever thanking them. Should something go wrong they immediately blame this huge Volunteer force they have. These Volunteer Players provide 85% or better of Verants Customer Service on a daily ongoing basis. I was told I was a disgrace I found this very amusing coming from the Upper Echelon of Verant GM staff. There are some GM's that are genuinely great and care about the players, but they are Temporary staff so even they live under the threat of a Hatchet day in and day out if they do not do what they are told.<P>But we learn, and we go on, perhaps you will hear more from me, and perhaps Verants Iron fist is so strong that you do not even get to see this statement. There were others with me this night who helped provide great entertainment for several players not just 10 Elite ones like on Xegony. To Calais the Gnome Kicker, Tygira is Stark Raving Mad, Valdul, and Desmo, all these Guides, Verant immediately removed from the program, and Suspended there accounts. To them I give my deepest apologize I was the Senior and had I not gone to the Arena none of the others would have followed because of me they lost there rights and access to there playing accounts I can in no way tell them how sorry I am and repay them for that. They were the best damn people you would have ever wanted to meet. Every last guide I had the pleasure of meeting and working with on Povar and Lanys T`Vyl in the last year were the greatest. The Senior staff and every last soul in the Guide program devote endless hours of devotion and time to help make EQ what it is today and they do this with Thanks from the players and not a single thank you from Verant. So ends the tail of Ozzadyen Servant to Lanys once Ozzadyen Servant to Povar, those always were my titles and I always lived up to them. <P>Now another thing that really gets to me is players are given warnings. As a guide in the program you are given no such Luxury not only was I immediately suspended but every account I had has been Suspended, all of them, not just my guide account but every account I have. This fact alone is pretty interesting as a member in Verants CS program you are treated far worse then even the most stubborn player that refuses to share a spawn and disrupts an entire zone, even they are given the common courtesy of only having there one account suspended.<P>Ozzadyen no More.<BR>Safe travels in the Lands of Norrath friends and may thee be Karana's flood and wash over thy enemies.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000934.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Ozzadyen+is+no+More....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Ozz! Say it aint so! <P>That sucks man. The guides were so much more accessible on Lanys t'vyl then my other servers. They would actually talk to you and even help a lot more then other servers I have played on. <P>I guess Verant cant see that guides can provide some fun outside of the normal hack and slash that players usually go thru. Its too bad really. They have some nifty tricks that provide amusement.(ever seen an ogre shrunk to the size of a peanut  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">) <P>Now I have to deal with guides that are sticks in the mud again.<P>Thanks for your service Ozz, you were appreciated by the players. Maybe Verant has a hard time seeing that guides are people too and if they deal with problems in a way that at least sometimes makes players laugh, it lightens an already tense situation because a player got zoned into lava or whatever.<P>Customer Service is just that. Customer Service. But this is CS for a gaming company. Games are supposed to be fun. Let the guides provide players with a little fun and enjoyment sometimes. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000934.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Ozzadyen+is+no+More....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Without drawing conclusions based only on one side of a story I still reserve my right to *BUMP*<P>EQ is a great game. IMO the best "game" ever made. However the support is very bad. From favortism to absurd rules ("Hi I'm Bob, and Im camping Mitty too now. Next is mine."), amongst many other things. I feel Verant is caught up in the idea that CS issues are just like grass is greener syndrome. That there isn't a real problem and people are just *****ing to *****.<P>Events should be fun without rewards. Populate a zone with (on average) 200 skels at all time ranging from level 1 to level 40 or something. Let everyone know it's gonna happen 30 minutes a head of time and letit last for 2 hours or so. Now thats an event. Even more  chilling is that that event HAS happened. A long time ago, in a server far far away, but nonetheless EQ was home to such an event. Of course they seem to no longer do things like that.<BR>Also, the "nite of the gods" to end beta was awesome. The servers are a year old and nothing like that has been done since. Why? Most people have no clue about these abscure GM dynamic quests. Gordon was so bold even as to say along the lines as there was much more to the quest then people know. That there was a story behind it but people just randomly killed.<P>Well hell, if people don't "get" the story is it the story tellers fault? Or the people get told the story?<P>Come on, if you were running though EC one day and say a 50 foot rogue  fighting a 50 foot human you'd stop and watch, right? You could even help out. Damn they need to occasionally do some kewl things. Not for items. Not with totally  hidden story lines that no one cares to know. But for fun. Make the world different every once in a while. You can't change the zones, but you can change who's in them.<P>/rant<P>~nerph<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000934.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Ozzadyen+is+no+More....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Hey Ozzy I thought you was Ozzayden Hater of Spam when you attended a Blue Rose Order wedding couple of months back....or was it Ozzayden the Sleepy.  Either way I am sorry to see you go.  I have noticed that the higher ups in Verant tend to be extremely fickle and make rash decisions based on little or no real evidence.  Verant wants drones run the Guides and GMs because heaven forbid that may displeased with a decision of the "gods".  At one time I decided to fill out the form to become a guide and then thought better of it because I wanted to have fun helping people....but Verant does not want their GMs/guides to have fun......only the fix each problem that comes down the pike based on their created rule-book with no feeback from the GMs.  Everquest should be somewhat of a democracy where the players could report to guides/GMs which in turn can pass the collective inputs up the chain farther.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000934.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Ozzadyen+is+no+More....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Hi Ozzy... I'll miss you...<P>Still remeber the several times I've saw you talking with other players, or trying to mediate some dispute...<P>I don't know why Verant did it to you(I would like to belive you, but since I've no facts...), but personally I think you was a very good GM, one that really cared for the players. Verant is always screwing things, not by nerfing or fixing exploits, but because they seem to not see that there are real people both playing and working on Everquest. They treat us all as drones, without any will and a single-minded behavior.(hack-and-slash, exploit) I think that if we got Everquest, with the Asheron Call staff to maintain and support it, it would be even better.(Have they ever tought of outsourcing the game maintenance and customer support????)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000934.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Ozzadyen+is+no+More....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
