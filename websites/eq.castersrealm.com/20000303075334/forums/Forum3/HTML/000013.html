</FONT><HR>Ok here's my beef about the many patches that have shown up in the past few months:<P>There is a disturbing trend that shows a great bias towards new players.  Namely, certain powerful or useful items that characters started early will probably have are almost impossible if not impossible to obtain for anyone started after these changes.<P>This rant relates to 3 particular items: the manastone, the j boots and the guise of the deceiver.   <P>1.  The manastone - it doesn't drop anymore! I know there was some talk of a possible quest but at this point its not in the game anymore.  Priest classes without a manastone are much less effective than priest classes with a manastone.  And I noticed the HUGE difference a manastone can make for an enchanter as well.  They spend a lot of time buffing and I watched the other day as one single enchanter buffed a whole dragon team (about 40 people +)with SLW and Rune 4 and clarity and the wis/intel buffs using his manastone because the clerics healed him.  My enchanter doesn't have SLW yet but i know its about 300 mana - someone starting a new enchanter or cleric or druid or shaman is at a severe disadvantage compared to people who started their characters early and were able to obtain this item.<P>2.  J-boots: Ok I know there is a quest and I know they still drop for people under about level 35 but what about the people who have to do this quest? My main character just missed the change and was a bit too high to camp at Najena for them.  He's very unlucky LOL. I have tried to find the ancient cyclops for over 2 months to no avail - I know where he spawns and i've even brought ranger friends to track for hours but he's never shown up.  At least with the old hours of camping one could be assured that they would get a pair of J-Boots if they put in X number of hours and waited in the long lines.  Right now all my spellcasting friends can solo guards in their spare time or when they can't find a group and have got a number of levels ahead of me doing this.  Again, people who did not start their characters in March or when the game first came out have been discriminated against I feel.  At this rate, all my friends will have been 50 for months when I finally get there and I still won't have j-boots.<P>3.  The Guise (or mask) of the deceiver.  This item although annoying - i'm an enchanter and didn't like all those dark elves running around - WAS A GODSEND TO THE LARGER RACES.  I really pitty the troll or orgre or barbarian who has got to about level 30 or so and who did not get one before they were changed.  SoLB - one of the best experience spots in the game for 35+ is basically off limits to them now unless they can find a shaman to shrink them and this isn't always easy to do.  I'm sure many other places are too small too but at least on my server shamans in 35+ dungeons aren't all that common.  <P>Thus, there is a disturbing trend that I see discourages players who did not start their characters early - or have not started them yet - from playing.  Granting players who have played longer special abilities that new players cannot hope to ever get (with the exception of j boots - i know i'm just unlucky about that one) seems incredibly unbalancing.  <P>To conclude: imagine 6 months from now ... 2 guild with two full groups in fear.  One guild is an old guild - all the clerics and classes who benefit from them have manastones.  The other guild is a newer guild everyone is 50 but NONE of the priest classes or buffing classes have manastones.  A train comes on these two groups who are sitting medding just after a huge fight. Everyone is down to below 20 mana.  The old guild uses their manastones to get out a few quick heals but find that its too much.  The wizards use their manastones to get the mana for evacs and they escape without any deaths.  The new guild uses up all their remaining mana trying to heal.  The wizards are just a bit short of mana for the evacs and they all die.  THAT'S IMBALANCING!  THAT PREVENTS NEW PEOPLE FROM WANTING TO PLAY OR NEWER CHARACTERS FROM WANTING TO CONTINUE THEIR CHARACTERS.  <P>So to Verdant/Brad/whoever can help: Please do something about these issues with manastone being the first priority followed by the guise of the deceiver followed by the virtual impossibility of getting j boots if you haven't and you are over 35.  That's my rant sorry I ran on so long but I like the game very much and I see this very disturbing trend which I don't like. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000013.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+Disturbing+Trend+Discouraging+New+Players">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Ummm, I think you pretty much explained why these itesm were taken out or made harder to get. They basically unbalanced the classes. The manastone gave all the classes more mana and with the aid of a cleric unlimited mana. manstone down then complete heal.... The only classes with hp -&gt; mana capabilites are the necro(allure, which is the poor mans clarity), and the shaman with cannibalize, which is a 1mana/2hp ratio, and their bet heal is just under 2hp/1mana. Thereby making it so it doesn't allow them unlimited mana. The Jboots i'm glad they made harder to get. This is a spell/ability that is granted to only a few classes in the game and the jboots basically give 4 classes a spell that in the end in useless. without jboots i think there would be alot less of wizards soloing guards. and well i don't see why they took out the guise.<P>Frostwulf<BR>Barbarin Shaman<BR>The Companions<BR>Tribunal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000013.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+Disturbing+Trend+Discouraging+New+Players">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Frostwulf-<P>I think you missed the point of this post.  There was an imbalance occurring, people would camp JBoots with a lvl 50 then log their lvl 20 on and loot them... soon this ultra-item was in the hands of the weakest characters due to twinking.<P>So their solution was to make it hard to get.  Now I go out and buy the game and log in, get to level 20, and am stuck fighting twinked out characters with mana stones and journeyman boots that give them VAST superiority to me... if they're going to die, they JBoot out... it they're out of mana and are PKing me, voila they convert up what they need for that final blast... etc.<P>They have alienated the new players by not having the guts to remove magic items.  If mana stones arn't going top drop anymore, PUBLICLY INFORM ALL PLAYERS THEY ARE BEING REMOVED FOR GAME UNBALANCING REASONS IN 2 WEEK - quite fair. Take it out of the game completely, then remove it from other players to restore balance.<P>As for Jboots?  Give a min level to get the quest (say, you MUST be lvl 40 for them to even offer you it), then PUBLICLY INFORM PLAYERS THAT IN 2 WEEKS ANYONE BELOW LEVEL 40 WILL BE LOOSING THEIR JOURNEYMAN BOOTS!<P>Quite simply, restore balance and enforce it equally on new characters and veteran players.  I know it sucks that you earned the mana stone and now you'll use it... but hey, what's more important - being fair to their entire customer base or favoring veteran players and handing them a VASTLY superior advantage?<P><P>------------------<BR>Kithra Of Rallos Zek<BR>Enchanter and Craftsman<BR>of Freeport</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000013.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+Disturbing+Trend+Discouraging+New+Players">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Just a few points I'd like to make.<P>If wizards are going oom on the planes, then they deserve to die. Even if they had manastones and could get enough mana to evac, you can bet your plat that they'll die in some other equally nasty manner because they aren't playing their class properly.  If a wiz gets to the point where a battle is so close that they have only enough mana left for an evac or a nuke, they better be picking the evac if they want to keep their friends. After all, what happens if that final nuke that is going to save the party from death is resisted?<P>The same goes for clerics. There is only one way possible that an entire party has pretty much zero health and the cleric is oom, and that's if the cleric was burning during the battle.  Same thing goes for them as the wiz. If they don't know how to play their class, then bye bye. If a battle gets to the point where a cleric HAS TO burn all their mana on nukes for whatever reason and the entire group is pretty much dead, the smart wiz that left enough mana for an evac better be casting it. Sure it may be boring, but a cleric that plays their role to perfection should be medding during the battle and healing after it, not burning and then plopping down to med with everyone else after the battle. Some classes have jobs in the beginning of battles, some have jobs in the middle, some have jobs at the end and some have jobs after the battle. Personally, I'd rather group with a Cleric that sat on his or her butt during fights (as long as the battle wasn't turning decidely against us), a Wiz that never goes oom rather than a wiz that's always oom at the end of a fight and a cleric that has a "I'm a Wizard!" syndrome.<P>The guise used to let large races get into small areas. I have no problem that this is gone, BUT there *should* have been areas designed where only large races could go that smaller folk couldn't get to. Because of the dynamics of the game, this probably will never be possible however. This isn't a good enough reason to bring back the guise though. I blame Verant for their short sightedness on not designing "large race only" areas to compliment the "small race only" areas.<P>The game is called Everquest, not Evercamp (though it appears that it should be most times). I agree with the idea of removing the J-Boots from Najena and making them a quest. They unfortunately moved the camp from Najena to SRo though. This is a prime example as to why Verant needs to implement a random quest generator. You find Hasten, hail him, he gives you a random quest. Once this quest is fullfilled, you give him the items and get your J-Boots. At any one time there can be 100 people questing for J-Boots, but they are not all sitting in SRo waiting for an Ancient Cyclops to spawn.  Some people are killing a griff in NK, some are killing HG's in Rathe Mountains, etc. At most you are competing against 5 or 10 other people for an item rather than a mile long wait to nuke the next Ancient that pops (if it even does for that matter). This would also help *gasp* grouping! 6 peole go to SRo to get a ring of the ancients.  All 6 want J-Boots. Who gets the first one (or second, third)? Fine, you have a loot order worked out. The person at the end probably isn't too happy with waiting for 3 months till their turn to loot comes up. Plus, how long are the other 5 going to stick around after they've had their J-Boots for the last 2 months?  Alternatively, first we go kill the Griff in NK that person 1 needs the xyz from, then we'll head to SRo and kill the Sand Giant that person 2 needs, then we'll go to Rathe Mountains and kill the Hill Giant that I need xyz from.  No competition and it probably won't take 3 months for everyone to get the items they need for their INDIVIDUAL J-Boot quests.<P>I dunno.  Just how *I* see things.  The way I look at it it's Verants game and they can do whatever the xxxx the want with it.  We as consumers can look at the individual changes and say "That's ones fine, that one is ok, I don't like that one, This one really xxxxxx me off!" and decide at that point whether we want to keep giving them money or not. For me, the changes, while I may not agree with some of them, aren't enough to make me want to quit.  That being said I stop worrying about it (the change) and continue paying them for a great game. When it gets to the point where a change does make me want to quit, oh well. I've got my moneys worth from Everquest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000013.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+Disturbing+Trend+Discouraging+New+Players">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>This topic is so lame.  You think everyone should be able to get every item?  Thats so stupid.  Isnt everyone in EQ similar enough already?  I personally believe that items should constantly change.  Keeps things interesting and makes things valuable.  You lamer, c'mon think about it.  So what if my new EQ friend cant get a manastone.  I guess he'll have to get something else thats really cool that they will take out later.  Thats fine.  Just forget about it.  You aint getting the guise, a manastone, nor rubicite from mobs anymore.  Just forget it.  They are really powerful items tthat dont belong in EVERYONES hands.  Just stop whining.  So many whiners my head is spinning.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000013.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+Disturbing+Trend+Discouraging+New+Players">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>   Thanks RhionSligo for that post - thanks for calling me a lamer and my topic stupid and me a whiner - but i think its an important issue and not just a random rant about class imbalance or the animation of a weapon changing or the experience lost being too great or about lag at peak times or something.  If you are frustrated with the burning issues and stuff - and rants (this is what this message board is) - don't come on and insult people just don't read them please.<P>   Basically, my post was just about the fact that with certain items certain classes who had started their characters in March or early on have a unfair advantage versus newer characters (and even if they do put in new items the older characters would get the old god-like manastone say AND the new item) - I really don't know what can be done but I would like to see all characters on equal footing somehow even if that would mean removing all manastones or something.  Speaking as someone who did not start in March (or early enough for some of this stuff at least) it is a BIG issue to me.  I've seen the difference just in terms of friends (and me) gaining levels that having, or not having, these items can do.  <P>   Oh yep, and Anon, that was just an example; sorry i'm not old enough to do planes yet - though my main character is almost there at 45.  I just know that a cleric with a manastone is way more effective than a cleric without one.<P>   Finally, I don't want to see all characters with the same items, but I don't want to see one character who has items that makes them god-like and another character who has put in the same amount of time and camping and not be able to compete with them at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000013.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+Disturbing+Trend+Discouraging+New+Players">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the original post. I was level 20 the week prior to Jboots being removed. How is it fair that a character who was in there low 20s could camp the spawn in a full group, get their jboots, and now I cannot get mine for another 10 to 15 levels? If the item was broken, it should have either never existed, or been removed completely, neither of which I am in favor of. It is not fair to those who have the boots to just remove them, neither is it fair to make the quest harder to get the boots. I know someone who has the boots, is a caster like myself, and has had a much easier time going up in levels from 20 to 30. I have stopped at 20th level, and just because I was a week late in camping for them, I should not have to suffer and watch a few friends who do have them dramatically jump ahead in levels. I do not see a fair solution, however I am tired of being on the proverbial bad side of the fence. If Verant is truly making the game more balanced by removing the boots, then I would like a written explanation from them, as to how it is fair that a character that got the boots a week prior to myself, can solo creatures that I cannot. Gee...thats game balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000013.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+Disturbing+Trend+Discouraging+New+Players">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>One of the few times it sounds like everyone has a good point (although some could have been put a little more TACTFULLY). I have no problem with someone who obtained something because they were here first or had forsight enough to get the item when they heard about it. (Still KICKING self for not grabbing that manastone when i could have) Hey thats life sometimes you miss out on opportunity. I think ONE solution Verant is toying with is to make the items purchaseable at REALLY high prices (ie Box of Ab'kor now Tinker box at about 7,000pp). I think that items should be offered both ways.<BR>A word on camping. Everyone seems to forget that camping is a PLAYER introduced concept. Its NOT built into the game. WE have decided to HONOR camped spots, no one made us do that. It is reasonable because there would be chaos with higher players bullying lower ones, but it is NOT Verant controlled. If Verant said that NOTHING can be camped I still think that players would come up with a system to prevent abuse. Ive met quite a few players that ignore camped mobs and insist on alternating or just plain taking the mob.<BR>As for removing items already in the game VERANT tried that once with the Box of Ab'kor (some name like that), a coding mistake they made gave it powers they didnt intend all they did was to return the box to its orginal intent. They QUICKLY changed their minds because people with the box were SERIOUS about stopping their account. Man what a YELL they put up!! Now multiply that by those with JBOOTS and other early gotten items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000013.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+Disturbing+Trend+Discouraging+New+Players">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000013&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000013&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
