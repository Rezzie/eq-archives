</FONT><HR>"You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material." <P>I think this might not stop their problems, since this prohibits selling but not buying. However some smart arse could sell his station name and password, which grants access to the account, however not breaching the TOS... Also, that is if you agree to their TOS. The day you stop agreeing to it, what holds you from selling the character? What can Verant say?<P>Actually I think all Verant wants is not to be held responsible for people being defrauded. However since the new TOS doesnt state you cant buy stuff then people will keep complaining to Verant since they were complying to the TOS hehe<P>Well I think Verant would be better off saying they will not support, reimburse, etc. anyone that does a third party transaction.<P>Now about Verant being able to access the data on your pc, its total bs. The idea is great, however does having showeq on your pc and not running a breach to the TOS? I think not. Also I hate to have someone scan through my daily porn  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/wink.gif"><P>P.S.: Dont tell Verant about the buy thing, I would hate them to add it to their TOS  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000651.cgi&ReplyNum=000050&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Licence+Agreement+To+Change.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the first point.  Remember, Verant isn't saying you can't sell on eBay.  You still can though they don't like it, but they can't stop you.  However, they no longer have to support situations involving scams.  If you get scammed, do NOT call Verant for support.  This removes some headaches they were getting from scams.  I'm all for this, makes their life easier and anyone that deals on eBay deserves whatever risks they take.<P>The second issue is trivial and can go either way.  I do believe it's state law that rules on privacy and I don't know California law as that is where the company resides.  But regardless, our law is rather old fashioned and naive.  There's almost no technology laws and it's really sad.  Japan and Singapore have stiff laws I believe, why can't we?  Anyways, I guess I don't care what they see on my computer.  I'm not stupid enough to keep important information on a computer hooked up to the World Wide Hack.  So I'm indifferent.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000651.cgi&ReplyNum=000051&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Licence+Agreement+To+Change.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I'm happy to see the people who are leaving go. They are not the people I want to be playing with.<P>I think people overestimate their own importance. I'd open my entire computer up to these folks because I respect their judgement.<P>If you don't like it, then cancel your accounts. You folks apparently care enough to ***** about it, do you care enough to quit? Again, you overestimate your importance.<P>I don't see anyone getting mad at the folks who created programs like ShowEQ. They're the entire reason for this mess anyway. ***** about it to them.<P>I'm going to enjoy two things from the aftermath of this....<P>1) Playing a game where it's a safe bet that everyone has the same odds as everyone else and no unfair advantages.<P>2) Running through a dungeon and NOT seeing someone farm the same mob day after day JUST to go sell it on E-Bay or some other auction site.<P>You don't own your account anymore than you own your internet account. You lease it and that's it. You own that EQ CD. But that's about it.<P>***** all you want, I'll be more than happy to stand up for Verant because they're WELL within their rights to handle it the way they have. If you don't like it, then stop playing. I challenge you to prove it to me that they value YOU more than anyone else.

</FONT><HR>I don't see why people are getting so upset. They reserved the right to change the Agreement:<P>"3.  We may amend this Agreement at any time in our sole discretion. Amendments shall be communicated to you at the time you log into your Account. Such amendments shall be effective whenever we make the notification available for your review."<P>Since you agreed to this rule when you purchased EQ, you can't get angry when they follow through and change the Agreement. As far as the new rules go, I'm all for 'em. They're merely protecting their business. It hurts them when people sell stuff on auction sites accounts becuase it encourages item camping to sell for money and makes other players angry. And for the computer probing part, it's no worse than having police on the freeway using a radar gun to track your speed. You can say that they're invading your privacy because it's not their business what speed your going. And what about phone companies? Do they not keep track of every number you call? What business is it of theirs who you call? It's not as if Verant plans on looking through everyone's files personally, they probably have some program that goes through and scans the files for programs with the same name or file size as known hacking programs. I highly doubt this program will obtain any pleasure by looking at what programs you're running. This is hardly an invasion of privacy, they did say that they will only be looking for known hacking programs. And for the couple people I saw saying this was anti-capitalist or communist, they must not know the meaning of the words. Is it not capitalistic of them to protect their business investments? Communism is just the devil, and nothing as fun as EQ can possible be ran by commies! Oh well, sorry if this post didn't make a lot of sense, I haven't slept in 96 hours. In fact, now that I think about it, sleep would be a good idea right now.

</FONT><HR>On the first Item of the license agreement I have no opinion, I really don't care since I do not sell or buy anything from E-bay and also agree that all transactions of items and such should take place as a matter of roleplaying and hard work not RL money.  The second item is a bit more touchy.  While I applaud Verant for making an effort to keep the EQ world Hack-free it worries me as to the extent that they seek to go to achieve this.  I am especially touchy about the wording used since by its wording means that if a program was running on the client computer that was not a hack but could potentially interfere with EQ then they would have the right to deny you access.  That is wrong.  I can see if the program would somehow cause irrepairable damage to their servers or cause network wide problems with the game but the terminology of 'interfere' and its possible meanings are just to broad to be acceptable.  And it is in that aspect that I do not agree with the second proposed item of the license agreement change.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000651.cgi&ReplyNum=000057&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Licence+Agreement+To+Change.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Sorry, but this is not legal here in West Virginia. I just got through helping with a case that the state took to court for basicly the same thing that Verant is doing here. The software company lost.<P>I do not care about E-bay, in fact they have already stated that this is illegal in thier old RoK, all they did was make it more specific.<P>As for the right to scan my computer, well I am on my work computer and it will not let them do it. If they were to scan it and my firm found out, all hell would break loose since there are personal data bases on it about our clinets !!! Verant would find themselves in court so fast that they would see the message " You are going to court, LOADING, PLEASE WAIT !" before they could change thier "new" policies!<P>If they scan my home computer, I will try my hardest to find some way of sending some virus or bombs back with the data that they might take. Do not tell me it can not be done, I handle all the internet fruad, Kracker/Hacker and anything to do with the net, cases for the state when we do end up taking them to court. I have seen many cases with some smart (but illegal) kids that will be more then willing to show us how to do this to help out thier cases, trust me, I have seen it many times before now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000651.cgi&ReplyNum=000059&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Licence+Agreement+To+Change.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Just a couple of notes on the scanning issue...<P>1) It will in no way hinder DoS style attacks.  They are apparently referring to some hack to the client that causes a server glitch.  That is easily stopped merely by checking the game files (like a CRC check.)  DoS attacks will still rock them if they aren't properly firewalled (and even if they are given enough skill.)<P>2) The ONLY real way for them to check for ShowEQ (or winshowEQ) is to see if you have a NIC in promiscuous mode on your network.  This is illegal and doesn't really prove anything since that is a common practice.  The tasklist can be modified to not show the program at all if you are dumb enough to run it on the same box.  Not a whole lot to scan for, now is there?<P>3) Even if they do scan your tasklist, how do they know what stuff is?  There are tons of things that could be running in your system.  Verant can't possibly know what they all are.  Personally, I use a lot of nonstandard apps like an alternate shell.  How can we expect them to have a clue what they are looking at?  So they can ban me on a whim because I run some unrelated program and they don't know what it is?  Thats BS.<P>4) This whole situation came about because Verant didn't encrypt the packets in the first place.  They knew this would happen.  It only became an issue when a distributable version of the program was released.  They failed to ensure their security from day one and now they want us to give up ours to cover their mistake.<P>5) Your IP is public.  It's known by every system you connect to, just like your home address is public.  Your data is not public just like your mail isn't.  There is a huge difference here.<P>6) Can you trust Verant?  I dunno.  I'm inclined to believe that GZ etc don't have ulterior motives, but they aren't the company.  Your data is worth a lot of money.  Your email addresses, what software you have installed, etc can be very tempting to lift for a company.  And just because they are being honest today (that is still not a given) doesn't mean they will be tomorrow.  But if you let them in without keeping an eye out, you'll never know.<P>7) Even if Verant does stay honest, its a precident.  That means the next great company can push even further and just farm your data.  If you give up a little bit of your privacy and/or rights every time someone asks you to, you eventually wont have any left.<P>8) The EULA is not legally binding yet (they are trying to do this in some states...very bad stuff) so you can click agree and it doesn't really mean much in court.<P>I will gladly allow Verant to sniff around my system if they agree to allow me to do the same to their systems.  I have a feeling they don't want me in their systems any more than I want them in mine.  Do they have something to hide?  Are they running ShowHydian?  Of course not.  They want their privacy just like I want mine.<P>I think ShowEQ sucks as much as anyone.  I wouldn't imagine using it.  Thats not the issue here.  What is the issue is your privacy and your rights to protect your network and data.<P>Anyone who is so willing to sell themselves out for a game, please send me an image of your hard drive and give me root access to your machine so I can get violate you too.  While you're at it, send me a copy of your house keys.  You might as well get it over with now.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000651.cgi&ReplyNum=000062&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Licence+Agreement+To+Change.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Just one quick comment about account ownership.<P>You DO NOT own your account.  You may feel like you do, but you don't.<P>Let's put it this way.  If you lease a car for 5 years, when those five years are up, are you going to feel like you own it?<P>Well, ok, maybe you would feel like you own it, but I can guarantee if you tried to sell it, you'd risk going to jail.<P>Anyway, having said that, I don't really have a problem with people that sell on ebay.  I just think they should pick better arguments than "Verant can't tell me I can't sell something I own", when they don't own it in the first place.<P>I say, if people want to spend some money to take a shortcut, let em.  Doesn't affect me at all, until I end up grouping with somebody who just bought an account and doesn't know what the hell they're doing.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>As far as the privacy issue goes...<P>I just want to chime in alongside the person who keeps trying to remind everybody that verant has already been illegally sending data from your computer to their servers, and for at least a portion of the time, that data was totally unencrypted, plain to see for anybody who cared to look.<P>This change to the license agreement is simply an attempt to cover their ass post-haste, and it will fail if any of the people who have been checking the packet streams have any concrete proof.<P>You want to check my computer to see if showeq is running?  Fine.  I don't care.

</FONT><HR>I think some people don't quite understand what Verant is trying to solve here... They are not trying to solve "character buying" from ebay, but in fact are trying to strike at the core of item farming which is causing overcrowding and loosing them more players than this policy of no-ebay could possibly loose.(Just go to one of the huge server boards... you'll see 90% of the players flaming ebay farmers, which shows Verant's point)  I mean think about it - if Verant looses the ebay farmers, good for them, they'll have more happy customers and less overcrowding to deal with.  It is a win-win situation, until you deal with the idea of selling your character... But anyway.<P>On the other hand, probing in someone's computer for ShowEQ might not be as bad as you imagine.  Verant already can hack into your computer if they want to, and if they wanted to they would've done it.  If you are using ShowEQ, ShowEQ is ran as a run-time exe file which interferes directly with the everquest.exe file and your internet connection. A thing like that can easily be detected.  ShowEQ is a run-time program which allows you to download more info from EQ than EQ usually allows you to.  It deciphers packets, but it can easily be detected by the right software because it downloads from the packets you receive from EQ.<P>I doubt Verant will go down into your comp and do a search for ShowEQ.exe.  What they will do, though, is probably do a run-time test to see if you are running any other programs other than Everquest when launching Everquest.  If ShowEQ is one of them - Bam you're banned.  <P>If what I believe is true(now come on, why would Verant want to peek at your private life? They already have CONTROL over your life :P), then I totally support their second policy.  ShowEQ might not seem much now... But let it go for a few monthes, and you'll have Diablo resurrected.  I'll assure you that loosing many players out of privacy violations(which shouldn't be true... but we'll see) is much better than loosing the majority due to hackerz.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000651.cgi&ReplyNum=000065&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Licence+Agreement+To+Change.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>On the other hand, probing in someone's computer for ShowEQ might not be as bad as you imagine. Verant already can hack into your computer if they want to, and if they wanted to they would've done it. If you are using ShowEQ, ShowEQ is ran as a run-time exe file which interferes directly with the everquest.exe file and your internet connection. A thing like that can easily be detected. ShowEQ is a run-time program which allows you to download more info from EQ than EQ usually allows you to. It deciphers packets, but it can easily be detected by the right software because it downloads from the packets you receive from EQ.<P><BR>I'm guessing you have no clue about this stuff.  A packet sniffer does not download more data from anything.  It merely looks at the data that is already traveling on your network.  It does not interfere with anything on your system, and showEQ itself is not even running on the same box.  And it is not easily detectable.  It can be done, but requires an anti-hacking tool designed to look for a NIC in promiscuous mode.  Running one of these on someone else's network is illegal and doesn't prove anything anyway.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000651.cgi&ReplyNum=000067&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Licence+Agreement+To+Change.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>On the topic of doing something against ebay farmers im a very positive.Sure places will still be farmed if nobody can sell their stuff for real-life cash but they will be camped for ingame purposes.I have no problem with someone camping if they sell it or trade it for other ingame stuff.That way others have a chance on buying stuff they normaly could not get (because of faction,to low lvl , not enough playtime etc.)<P>What i am completely against is Verant (or anybody else ) checking out my computer.They don't have the right to do this.Privacy is at stake here.And maybe they don't care what is on your PC or harddisk ,thats not the point.The point is they compromise your privacy and if they can get away with it, who is gonna stop the next company to do it ?<BR>If they gonna go with this policy , they are gonna lose lots of players (including me and several of my RL friends) and they are gonne risk a hell of a lawsuit, you can be sure of that.This is totaly illegal and they will feel the consequences of it,be sure of that.<BR>In most European countries , this course of action is condemned (hell even the disclaimer the post now has no legal rights in Europe)<P>EQ has been fun and was great,but they day they put this up when you log on is the day i quit my account.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000651.cgi&ReplyNum=000069&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Licence+Agreement+To+Change.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>The fact is Verant was retrieving this information PRIOR to requesting our consent.  This is not only legally questionable but morally suspect.  I for one am making phone calls and sending emails stating serious complaints against this practice and Verant in particular.  I strongly urge all of you concerned to visit the California Attorney Generals website at <A HREF="http://caag.state.ca.us" TARGET=_blank>http://caag.state.ca.us</A>  or fill out this complaint form on their site for the state of California regarding inproper business practices: <A HREF="http://caag.state.ca.us/piu/mailform.htm." TARGET=_blank>http://caag.state.ca.us/piu/mailform.htm.</A>   I would also contact the ACLU if you are so inclined, as I am going to do.  This is totally unacceptable and I find this statement by Mr. Smedley to be an example of what makes me angry:. "I apologize if we weren't specifically asking for permission before..." -- JS smedley 4/4/2000.<P>I don't care one iota if you apologize Mr. Smedley, let me download information from your personal computer and see if an apology cuts it.

</FONT><HR>I can not, and will not agree to this blatant intrusion into our private lives.  Yes, it's game related files, they say, but they are on OUR computers, files that WE pay for, and WE use.  As long as we are not using any programs to interfere with the game files' normal routines, which Verant can NOT assume that everyone is, this is ridiculous, and offensive!  So, because some players "may" be using a hacking program, or altering code, everyone is scanned, evaluated and tested.<P>Honestly, if this goes through, Verant will lose a LOT of subscribers, a LOT of money, and my money will probably be part of what they're losing.  I know there are other games out there, and I won't hesitate to switch to a company that RESPECTS its customers, and treats them with dignity.  <P>I guess Verant is the new Uber Mob.  Class:  Rogue.
