    <td width='100%' bgcolor='#130451' class='spti2'>A LEARNING EXPERIENCE - JUNE 19-23 REVIEWED
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width='100%' class='db'>In recent weeks Verant has made a number of changes in Everquest in an attempt to ensure long term balance and maintain the integrity of the game experience.  Unfortunately it seems to have done so without sufficient forethought or player discussion prior to implementation and this has lead to some very poor decisions.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      For those who haven't been following closely what has transpired in recent times there were two main events; the test server player wipe and the great dragon
      nerf.  Now in both of these areas there has been some revision and discussion, but it has still been a week of backpeddling by Verant, which follows recent problems with the Kunark Shipping catastrophe, and a spate of controversial
      bannings.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The big question has to be, what's going on with Verant?  And the only answer on peoples lips right know is that people just don't know.  This is leading to a feeling of unrest and uncertainty in the gaming environment and for many veteran players this is pushing them over the edge and hundreds of players have left the game as a result of this poor design implementation by the team at VI.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Whilst they are the 'gods' of Everquest the question must be asked as to what other ways they could achieve the balances they are looking for - and what can they do in the future to ensure that we never have another week like that of June 19 - 23, 2000.<br>
      <br>
      Turning firstly to the Test Server wipe.  The Test Server has always been a strange environment.  The server was designed to be used for testing zones and to locate bugs before they go to the live servers.  As many of the players on that server will tell you - it has of late become more of a play server than a testing one, and a great number of characters play on it with absolutely no intention of ever testing anything.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Why do people play on test with this attitude?  Well the server population on test has always been small - no overcrowding, and generally no 'l33t k3wl-d00ds'.  It also had the allure in the past of characters being able to be 'buffed' instantly raising them to level 50, or when Kunark was being tested, to level 60.  It also allowed them to get access to very powerful items.  It had no official GM support, but Verant staff did pop in from time to time, and even played on the server.<br>
      <br>
      The problem with this perfect environment for players was that it was no longer a balanced 'testing platform' from Verant's perspective.  This opinion of Verant was accelerated after a bug in Solusek B saw every mob in the zone dropping loot from Nagafens data table.  Kobolds were dropping CoF's and Orbs of
      Tishan, and Paladin books were being destroyed by the handful to make room for better loot.  The zone was dropped, then the server, and on the following Monday Verant released the following statement:
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>Over the past 15 months, the Test Server has been a fantastic platform for testing new and proposed changes to the live EverQuest servers. However, in the past couple of months, with the release of several new zones, plus the entire Kunark expansion, the characters on the test server, and the equipment they carry, have been further deviating from the norm that is expected on the Live servers. This has made testing certain aspects of the game more and more difficult as time goes on.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        With great sympathy to those that have built their characters on Test and made the server their home, it is now necessary that we 'clean the slate' on the Test server and return it to a state that will allow successful testing to take place. To that end, as of today, all characters have been deleted from the Test server. Though no reimbursement of characters, equipment, or levels is planned, strict guidelines have been established to govern future artificial buffing and equipment allocations on the test server in order to insure that the environment remains a clean testbed for enhancements proposed for the Live servers.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        We would like to thank all of the Testers that have been helping on the server since release, and we hope that you will continue to do so. An email address
        (testserver@verant.com) has been set up to receive your comments on this issue. We will make sure that your comments are forwarded to the appropriate people.<br>
        <br>
        Thank you for your understanding,<br>
        <br>
        The EverQuest Team</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This action stunned the players of Test Server, as well as most other players in the EQ community. Test Server or not, for many playing EQ is a dedication.  Hundreds - even thousands - of hours are put into developing a character.  Having that simply taken away with no notice was simply unacceptable.  The players revolted and within 24 hours Verant had realized the blunder they had made.  Brad McQuaid spent a lengthy time on the Test Server talking with players and within 48 hours after the deletion players were being restored.</p>
      <p>The final choice was that all players except those which were knowingly 'buffed' were restored, but all characters lost their items.  Players will soon be offered a chance to move off Test to an official production server, and those that remain accept the risk that at any time they may have their characters wiped.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Now this is what they should have done in the first place.  Admittedly mistakes can be made, but issues which involve an entire server community like this one did should be discussed with the player base.    Unfortunately the backpeddle is for many too little too late.  According to discussions I have had with players on Test many have left the game for good, unwilling to continue a gaming relationship with Verant.  Many have stayed, and say the server is bouncing back quite well - but the true impact of this action is that Verant destroyed in one single moment a large amount of the player confidence in their abilities not only to implement design choices, but in how they treat the
      playerbase.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>However this was not to be the only poor choice of Verant in that week.  There has been a great deal of debate between players in relation to the old dragons of Antonica and how they would be handled after the expansion when players got a great deal more powerful.  Verant  said they had a 'surprise' in store for how they would deal with it.  This implied, one would assume, that they had put a deal of forethought into the problem.  This certainly did not appear to be the case when the following statement was released in a patch message:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>Over the past couple of weeks, we've received more and more reports of these dragons being bested by smaller and smaller groups of higher-level (high 50s) adventurers. As we've always felt that Dragons should be special encounters that require a large number of people, we were left with some choices.<br>
        <br>
        One choice available to us was to increase the power of the dragons to a level where the level 60 folks would find them challenging. This would have the disadvantage of forever placing them out-of-reach for those who did not buy
        Kunark, and place them further out-of-reach for those who did, but are just now approaching the levels where they could go on Dragon raids. Another possible solution was to make the dragons flee
        (depop) when engaged by a more powerful group of people. This would have the undesired effect of allowing some people to deny others the experience of fighting a dragon.<br>
        <br>
        Instead of raising the bar as mentioned above, we've instead decided that dragons, or at least these two dragons, should have the magical ability to pick their own fights. Players of level 53 or above will now encounter some difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with these dragons. This should help 40s and low 50-level characters with their chances to encounter a dragon without worry of getting forced out by much higher level players. In addition, it also has the added effect of creating a natural progression from the younger dragons of Antonica to the elder and more formidable dragons of
        Kunark.</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What did this actually mean?  Well in practice it meant that any player Level 53 or over who found themselves on the hate-list of either dragon would be immediately teleported outside of the dungeon.  This seems to be a great deal more than 'some difficulty'; it is simply impossible for a Level 53+ to participate in a dragon raid in the old continent.  Many small guilds or non guilded players at this level have never even seen these dragons, and now will not have a chance to do so.  There are of course loot and item issues also, particularly for Paladins who have to kill the dragons as part of their Quest for the Fiery Avenger.</p>
      <p>Once again player satisfaction has been shattered by this.  Verant had a number of different options which they could have implemented here.  One suggestion was implementing reduced effectiveness against these mobs.&nbsp;
      This would mean that as players got higher in level, once they are on the hate-list of a dragon their melee and magical damage output would be reduced.  It would also include a check so that any one below Level 52 could not have any spell above Level 52 cast on them.  This would mean at Level 60 players couldn't simply own the mob with six people, and would still keep the battle a large-scaled 'event'.   It would keep all players at a maximum 'play level' of Level 52.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Now this may be difficult to implement, but the simple fact is Verant can no longer afford to do the easy 'quick fix' any longer.  There is a definite feeling in the player community that they simply do whatever is simplest rather than do the substantial code changes required to implement serious design changes properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>With the whole Kunark shipping debacle, the poor testing of the initial loot tables for mobs in the new lands and a number of recent crackdowns by GM's with player
      banning's (many of which have been reversed on appeal), a large number of veteran players have put their accounts on hold, or cancelled them altogether.  I have watched many of my friends that I have spent the last 15 months playing with leave the game.  People who I have known since I was killing moss-snakes have been sending in their goodbyes and this is, in my opinion, indicative of most servers right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Whilst Verant have been doing as much as they can to repair the damage made from their recent mistakes the combination of all these problems has seriously eroded the confidence in the player community.  It is going to be a long time before it returns to where it was six months ago, if it ever even does so.  It is a time where the player community really needs to look after each other and keep our friends going until everything settles
      down.&nbsp; Hopefully Verant will treat this as a learning experience, and in future discuss things with players more before implementing such large decisions.</p>
      <p>Whilst the player community cannot have input in every game decision which happens, and nor should they, the simple fact remains that 200,000+ players will be able to provide valuable input in discussing possible problems with proposed ideas for dealing with critical gameplay issues.  I think in the long term discussing things like this can also only serve to help relationships between Verant and the players improve, as confidence returns in the design implementation of the staff.</p>
      <p>We all know we are in their world now, but I would submit it is time to evolve and realize that the people who pay to play will not remain long-term players if they are not given more consistent, balanced and well discussed game changes in the future.  No one disagrees that changes do have to be made in an evolving MMORPG in order to maintain game integrity, but the last week has clearly shown that it is far better to make these changes balanced and well implemented the first time around, than to be left backpeddling and cleaning up the mess from a rush-job.</p>
