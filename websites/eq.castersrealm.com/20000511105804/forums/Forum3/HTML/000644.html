</FONT><HR>Well, I've been three weeks away from EQ...my head is much clearer, and I think I have a pretty good perspective of what's going on....<BR>YOU'RE ALL BRAINWASHED!!!!<BR>Sorry, but it's true...you've been wanting this game to work for so long to justify all of the time you've put in it, that you're ACTUALLY begging, pleading, and whining for them to change.  They come back and give you little tidbits, and you're happy, until you find out they nerfed something else in the process.<P>You know, I've been playing AC for two weeks now, and I ask the people in there which game they like better...EQ or AC...I have yet to find one that WANTS to play EQ.  And when I describe it to them..the zones, the camping, the lack of balance between caster and melee...they laugh at me!  They honestly do!  They can't understand why people put up with such things as you guys do...and honestly, I have to agree with them.  <P>You know what EQ lost?  Immersiveness.  It's just that simple.  You don't feel like you're in a different world there..you feel like leveling, and getting some item to make you minutely better...trying to beat the odds put against you by Verant.  You're labrats.  Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they have meetings with Psychiatrists to figure out ways to keep you guys brainwashed into this game.  <P>Don't agree with what I'm saying?  Try me.  Take a week off from EQ, then go buy AC and play it for a week or two.  I guarantee you'll start feeling like you're really in a different world, and that you're character really is worth something...because you create it as you like..while you play.  No "predefined vision" crap to deal with..the only vision is yours.<P>Of course, your other option is to look around you, at all the other characters that look the same, and fight relatively the same, and don't roleplay because there's no cause..nothing to believe in in EQ...just "camp this to get this".<P>Oh, and to answer the "Shut up and go to AC already!" cries, I say this....You don't have to convince me to go have fun for once!

</FONT><HR>I tried AC for a little while.  <P>It is empty.  No people.  No monsters.  Nothing.<P>I exaggerate a bit there, but AC really is an empty game.  There's even less of point to play AC than EQ.  Take a look at the numbers. Are there 5 servers for AC?  1000 or so people max on each one?  Compare that the number of people that play EQ.  <P>AC is not sufficient competition for EQ.  That, IMO, is the single greatest reason why people still play EQ:  there's nothing better at this moment.  The next reason why people play EQ is that's where their friends/guilds are.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000644.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=On+melee+vs+caster....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well I think some of  what you say is true.<BR>I don't play EQ anymore (damn 18 months on one game is enough) but I still like the community and like to see what happens(ie. changes and nerfs and what not).<BR>EQ in a nut shell is a VERY good game. For those of us that bash it (and I bash those that make it, not the game it self), we all probably spent TONS AND TONS of hours playing it, thinking,<BR>"damn, this is a good ******* game".<BR>EQ is mostly about exploration, meeting new people, etc. When I think back to my first experiences with the game,(thankfully it was in beta when only 1 server and no spoilers existed) the awe of the 3-D world we were given to play in was immense. <BR>Perhaps the only reason I continue to "bash" Verant is I hope to someday play EQ2. I hope that at that time, Verant will, with the help of us that complain, have processes in place to deal with what they have created.<P>Which is...<BR>A place where people forget real life for LONG periods of time. <P>"Grass is greener" syndrome is bound to happen but please, have processes in place to check these.<BR>Too many major problems have been(some still continue to be) allowed to hang around for months and months without getting fixes or the attention they need. Mage pets, Alchemy, DOT users kiting reds in their 30's, rogue woes, etc. Many were very easy changes to make. Some were due to terrible planning or cheap code. But ALL should have been found much much sooner.<BR>I get the feeling that about 8 months from now when a few of the new MMORPG's are out and people start to leave in droves, Verant will come out and say,<BR>"Well we just finally looked at the logs, and you were right, meele wasn't doing as much dmg as we thought they were. There was a problem with the way we tested this in house. Seems Brad's ranger, which was our test model, was using a weapon with 62 dmg and 8 delay, making meele dmg seem balanced."<P>See, there is some truth to this. Melee, with the VERY BEST equipment (read weapon) can do some bad ass things. However, is it reasonable to balance a set of classes based on getting a weapon from a god or uber-mob? A weapon most of us will never see.<BR>And here lies the truth of Verants balancing. They do not balance the game for the "average Joe". They balance the game based on what a powerleveler can do. In many ways I agree with this since in many cases it's only the powergamers who gets pissed about balance while the casual gamer doesn't worry as much. In other ways I think it only goes to screw the majority. Which btw are IMO a bunch of wanna-b-power-levelers.<BR>Who knows?<P>~nerph</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000644.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=On+melee+vs+caster....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>'allo!<P>Trooper, I wanted to address yours first.  I'm confused as to why you think AC is empty?  If you define empty as in "I've been hunting around, and OH S*IT, WHERE'S TOWN??, yes, you can definitely feel an emptiness there.  I know I feel it when I'm standing on a high hill, looking all around me for miles.  With no zones to mark your travel with, sure, the world is a big empty place because coming up on a town is just that...there's no "zoning" into a town.<P>If you define empty as a lack of intra-zone complaints, auctions, ooc's, and other such talk, you got me there, too.  You can only see what people say that are in your general area. So out in the middle of the woods, who can really hear you scream? (ok, had to throw that one in there.)<P>If you define empty as lack of things to fight?  Well, on that I have to disagree with you.  In EQ, I have waited for nearly half an hour for a kodiak to show up, only to have three spawn in mid-air and stay there for another 10 minutes before being split up enough to attack.  No fun there.  It hurts worse when you wait and wait for that spawn, only to have someone come by and outboom you.  No experience, no loot...nothing for your time.  In AC, there are spawns all over the place.  There are dozens of dungeons with great loot, and campfires in the woods with monsters huddled around them, and so much more.  I'm sorry, I can't agree with you there.<P>If you define empty as lack of questing and in-game events, then again, I have to disagree with you.  Every month, there's a large scale storyline that gets added to....usually it ties in with the last month's event.  Like right now....last month, large spires of shadow "appeared" from the ground, and shapes of a demon in the lightning began to appear in the storms.  This month, I have seen players speaking of the shadows that have begun to appear.  And it wasn't "Hey, you see those shadows there?  Wonder what they drop?", it was more "Have you seen the shadows that lurk near the spires?" "Yes, I have..and I have warned the towns"....THESE PEOPLE ROLEPLAYED!  And they did it on their own...because a story is lurking in the background that they can attach themselves to.<P>If you define empty as "lack of players compared to EQ", well, ok..you've got me on that one for sure.  There isn't any crowding issues I can see, and there are fewer servers.  But, you know...I got tired of running all the way over to a place, only to find that it's entirely camped, and nobody wants to share.  With a lack of kill stealing, mobs all over the place, and loot much more freely available, there are no camps...at least none that anyone stay at from more than a few kills.<P>As for why all of this is here?  Simple.  Verant has fallen into the Hollywood style gaming company mentality.  You guys are getting shafted big time, and I just want you to see that.  This is coming from a former HARDCORE Eq lover...not some pansy "I played EQ for a month, ugh!".<P>As for the "Grass is always greener", yeah, you always gotta watch out for that.  I think I have.  I compare AC to EQ and UO, and even stack it up against games coming out.  I know it's not the best (there are downsides, like no on call GM's in-game...if you have an issue, you send an e-mail.  I don't like that.), but the game design is much more thought out, and it's so easy to get in there, look the way you want, fight the way you want, and have some really great adventures and roleplaying experience...especially with the patron system.<P>Anyways, that's my rant.  Just think about it, is all I ask.<P>Sienne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000644.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=On+melee+vs+caster....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I played AC for a couple weeks during late beta...  It had its strong points and weaknesses.  I happen to prefer EQ still.  <P>Why?  AC is a lot more solo oriented.  You can make an extremely self-sufficient character and the mobs are generally easier to take down.  A level 2 person can literally hack through an entire dungeon solo with little or no down-time.  Why is non-stop solo action not good?  I happen to like the close-knit interactions you have in EQ that result from class inter-dependencies and the need to group to tackle most worthwhile things.<P>People do role-play in EQ.  Not all of them, but lots.  My enchanter recently fell in with a cult of Goblin Lord worshipers.  =)<P>EQ isn't without its problems.  There is perhaps a little too much down-time.  The crowding is bad.  Some classes need work...  The traffic you see on these boards is a result of that.  People love the game so much they really care.  I couldn't even be bothered to report bugs when I played AC.<P>Am I saying EQ is better than AC?  No.  I just happen to prefer it is all.  Different games attract different people.  It's allright to urge the unhappy to try new things they might enjoy better, but don't tell us we're being "shafted" by EQ.  It's simply not true.  It's like saying someone is being shafted by chocolate because there's toffee out there too!  In excessive amounts both chocolate and EQ are bad for you, but they taste so good...  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000644.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=On+melee+vs+caster....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>*smile* <BR>Ok, good point..I like the chocolate analogy, myself  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/biggrin.gif"> .  But I did want to correct you on one point.  Although it's true that in AC you can create a much more soloable character, you're not omnipotent as you might think.  What they've done in AC is make dungeons level specific only.  This keeps the newbies out of the advanced dungeons, and the powergamer away from farming items from lower level dungeons.  I like that thought.  As for interclass dependancies, you should see how happy the melee classes are with you when you've enchanted them with sprint and quickness, enchanted their weapons with blood drinker, enchanted their armor with invulterability, etc....to be a magic user in AC puts 1600 spells at your disposal, spread across 4 different schools of magic...to train in a school of magic gives you access to hundreds of spells..the ones you pick are up to you.  Personally, I have an archer with creature magic so I can enhance myself and others, and life magic, to heal myself and others.  Later, if I want to learn war magic, I can, and choose from their spells...or item magic...it's all up to me.  My class is my vision of the character.  I like that.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/cool.gif"><BR>Another example is the warrior I created...skilled in swords and unarmed combat, she also trained the ability to use healing kits, of which there are various types to heal various amounts of damage.  She's in plate mail for the most part, and she carries five swords:  one lightning, one fire, one ice, and one acid, and one "regular" sword that hits for nice damage".  I can use these swords for different types of monsters, because some monsters are more prone to different types of attacks than others.  I hope to someday have an Atlan sword, because that has a container for a stone, of which there are 4 stones spread across the land.  When you need a special type of attack (fire), you put in the fire stone...and now you have a nice sword that does fire damage...etc.  When a character goes into attack mode, their character not only stands in an attack pose based on the type of weapon they have, but their body shifts about...ready to attack in any direction.  With the ability to adjust the power and height of your swing manualy (if you choose), and the variations of attacks based on power and distance from the target, you really feel like a warrior.  There's also collision detection in the game, and so houses are safe areas, and arrows hit tree branches and fall to the ground.  Arrows and war magic spells are line of sight..so no arrows doing 90 degree turns.<P>I guess what I'm saying, and the whole point of this, is that despite what you may have seen in a brief look at AC, there's alot of well thought out magic and melee going on in there.  These are things that EQ could have put in, but don't....and they keep coming up with excuses on why they can't keep this promise,and how this feature that other companies come with STANDARD for any rpg, don't fit into Verant's "Vision" of a game.  I'm here to warn you to NOT get sucked into believing that you should get any less than what these gaming companies OWE you in a game you pay for.  If they're the only gig in town, maybe.  But they're not.  AC is out, others come close behind.  Dark Age of Camelot, Horizons, Deimos, Awakening Project...they're all coming...and ALL of them are coming with the features that AC has as standard.  If Verant is too proud to keep with a standard vision of RPG and offer at least the same features as their competition, why get sucked in with them?  <P>Again, more copper being thrown around.  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><BR>Sienne.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000644.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=On+melee+vs+caster....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>What I meant by empty was my involvement with the game world.  It didn't happen.  In EQ there are at least a lot of people to talk with.  Yes, sometimes it's annoying to listen to all the shouts and ooc's, but then you know there's other people out there playing along.  I played for 6 hours in AC and didn't see another player.  That's fine for single player games, but when I want to play MMORPG, i want other people to be playing as well.<P>Oh, and I tried the PVP server.  My level 1 war mage killed the level 3 fighter that tried to PK him.  There's something really wrong when a level 1 mage with no player skill other than hitting the cast spell button as fast as I could, can kill a level 3.  The guy even ran away at 3/4 life.  Guess my FPS instincts took over.<P>Severe flaws in game mechanics like that make the game pointless to play.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000644.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=On+melee+vs+caster....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>EQ has kept my interest for a year... except for the 2 month stint i took to AC. Any new game is great at first but AC has no staying power. I never felt so alone in an online world as in AC. Yes there are online people but there chat system sucks, and there guildlike chat system sucks. Magic = 5 spells upgraded every level. Same monsters over and over just walk over a hill and there they are. Doesnt matter where in the world you go its exactly the same. Class balance? Only 2 classes shine Archer Item mages and War Magic mages. After 2 months i dropped this like a hot potatoe. EQ looked REALY good after this.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000644.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=On+melee+vs+caster....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000644&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000644&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
