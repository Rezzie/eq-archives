    <td width='100%'><small><font face='Arial'>I sent a rather long e-mail to GZ yesterday and
    I was suprised to get a response as quickly as I did... He ignored some things I brought
    up (which were left out of the response) but he did respond to a lot of it. It has a
    little more info about other things then the other responses I have seen so far. Not sure

    <small><p><font face='Arial'>Don't have this spell yet and won't have it for awhile;
    however, I do look forward to eventually having levitation. One comment here though:
    Another part of this spell is underwater breathing... is it possible to levitate under
    water?? This is a sincere question as I really don't know; however, that would seem
    strange. This change also had no real effect on how &quot;powerful&quot; the Necromancer
    class is. </font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>Dead man floating does not work underwater - but necromancers do
    have another self only water breathing spell. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><strong>Screaming Terror:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'>Well this would be a really nice spell if it worked. A month or so
    ago a patch was supposed to make this spell have one saving throw instead of two separate
    ones to stop it from causing massive trains (Since the MOB would be feared but its argo
    list wouldn't be cleared); however, as of a week or two ago this still was not working. In
    it's current form the spell is totally useless since casting it will most likely result in
    death. Will you please fix this spell?? </font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>It is on my list to discuss with out AI guy. I play a necro -
    bugs me too. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><strong>Quests added for necromancer pet spell words:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'>Well this is nice; however, I do have some problems with the quests.
    1) For the level 49 word quests you have to go to the Plane of Fear and the
    &nbsp; component is even rarer then the words themselves. The main complaints I heard
    before the quests were added was that you basically had to go to PoF to have any chance of
    finding the words since so few things dropped them. I am not level 49 yet; however, when I
    get there I would like a decent chance at getting my pet without having to go to the plane
    of fear (or kill dragons).</font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>The components can be found on normal monsters - but if you dont

    <p><font face='Arial'><strong>Sol Ro Necro Quests:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'>I LOVE these quests and the items you get for them; however, all
    classes had quests added so this wasn't anything that really just benefited necromancers;
    however, I did want to say I love wearing all black and having that wicked looking
    scythe... now if I could only swing it sometimes. </font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>Thanks - had fun makin those. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><strong>Charm:</strong></font></p>
    </small><p><font face='Arial'><small>This was done before I got to level 24 where we got
    the first charm spell so I can't really speak about how much a nerf this really was;
    however, when it was announced we were assured that they would be replaced by spells of
    equivalent power. The lower level charm spell was replaced with screaming terror which
    would be a VERY nice spell if it worked (see above); however, the better charm was never
    replaced by anything. Will you ever give us a spell to replace the higher level charm?
    When this happened I read various e-mail responses by you stating that you were working on
    it but that was months ago. </small></font></p>
    <small><p><font face='Arial'><em>The problem with charm is that the max creature level it
    could effect was something like 20. This made it always worse then your pet spell. Good
    for a few things and for fun. We really wanted only Enchanters casting charm (though
    necromancers did keep undead charm), so we did remove it. </em></font></p>
    </small><p><font face='Arial'><strong><small>DoT Movement Nerf:</small></strong></font></p>
    <small><p><font face='Arial'>When this first was going to happen (with no damage while a
    MOB was moving) I was ready to cancel my account. I am still not happy with this change
    and I think there are some problems with it that if fixed would at least make it a little
    more palatable. I'm not sure how much you have played a necromancer (or any pet class for
    that matter) but a MOB is constantly moving while my pet is attacking it... it will turn
    and come after me a very short ways and then turn back to my pet... this happens
    constantly even if I never cast a spell at the MOB. I don't think the damage should be
    reduced during this period since it is still in melee range of my pet. </font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>I have 2 necromancer characters - one low mid and 1 high level.
    Oh, and I would say that about 80% of the time is does that little dance move with your
    pet it is taking full damage. From experience and knowing how it works. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><strong>Resistance To Taps:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'>The latest and IMHO the worst change. The first thing I have to say
    is that I was totally disgusted that you didn't even bother to announce the change. This
    is VERY poor PR and this was a MAJOR change so I don't think there is any way it could
    have &quot;slipped though&quot; like many other changes that haven't been announced.</font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'>Now, I am not saying that I feel like our taps should be totally
    unresistible by MOBs far above your level; however, I do feel this spell should be VERY
    hard to resist by any MOB 6 levels higher then you and under and then still have some
    chance (although very little) at tapping things&nbsp; above that. These spells are very
    mana inefficient; however, that was somewhat offset by them being unresistible. Also since
    these spells have a heal component to them getting a resist on the spell can be deadly to
    the necromancer. This single change has drastically nerfed our class and is totally
    unacceptable in it's current form. If you want to stop a large group of level 20ish
    necromancers from taking down a Sand Giant I can&nbsp; understand this; however, the
    change made was far too drastic. In addition, I have heard reports that dragons resist
    this spell 100% of the time even with level 50 Necromancers. If this is true I will be
    extremely angry when I get to a level that I can attempt to take down a dragon with a
    large group of friends but I can't use my taps.</font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>The change happened while I was gone and I kicked some butt for
    them not announcing it. There was (and always has been) a bug that lifetap was not ever
    resisted. A lvl 1 could lifetap a lvl 50 and the level 50 would never save. This is
    obviously a bug, and has been announced as such every time we are asked. When we found the
    source of it recently we did fix it, but left it so that if the creature is within the 6-8
    level spread of you, it won't save. The only creatures that will save vs. lifetap are ones
    that many levels above you, or ones that are completely immune to magic (+150 save vs.
    magic or so). We basicially put like a -50 save on all lifetaps. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><strong>In conclusion:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'>I don't think necromancers were ever more powerful then the other
    casters and they already had problems (Not very useful in groups, KoS everywhere, best
    spells are research only and the components are very hard to get, no real DD except level
    24). These changes have drastically reduced our power from the level it was then I started
    my Necromancer and I am not happy about it. I knew there were many problems with being a
    necromancer but I was willing to live with them since I liked what they were able to do
    (and I really thought some things would be made better in the future). I started my
    current necromancer after taking two other characters to level 17 and I used to love being
    a necromancer; however, now I would never think of starting a necromancer because of their
    current state. That is really sad a class I used to love I would never even think of
    starting if given the option again. </font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'>I think nerfing a class is wrong, if things are slightly out of
    balance increase the power of the classes that aren't as powerful, then you make
    &nbsp; everyone happy... well almost everyone, there are always a few who are never happy
    . At the very least if you take away an ability at least give&nbsp; something useful back
    in return (i.e. we are making this DoT change so in return we have added a couple more DD
    spells... and no the one addition tick of damage was not enough). Nerfing just makes the
    people it effected angry and makes everyone else look over there shoulder wondering if
    they will be the next class nerfed. Although, it seems like most nerfs effect necromancers
    so I guess they don't have to worry about it until our class is no more </font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>I don't like nerfing - aside for the 100's of angry e-mail I get
    (I have always had my e-mail address out there - believe me, I don't like getting a box
    full of unhappy people) I feel that it is unfair to our player base who have chosen a
    class/race based on the information that was correct at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't like
    it to the point that I agrue against nerfing at almost every tuning meeting if a nerf is
    suggested. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>I also, however, don't like bugs that ruin or imbalance game
    play. It is always a hard tradeoff betweeen good gameplay and nerfing a class. Only if we
    feel something seriously effects gameplay do we put in a &quot;change&quot; or a
    &quot;nerf.&quot; These are bad situations - but in most cases necessary to keep a
    healthly game.&nbsp; It is never fun though. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><strong>One final note: </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'>There is a quest in the Tier'dal necromancer guild for a &quot;Ring
    of the Dead&quot; which according to the NPCs is supposed to have a charge of gate to the
    guild. It currently has a charge of bind... is this ever going to be fixed? </font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>I dont know much about that quest - sorry. I'll take a look
    though. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'>Well if you read this very long e-mail, thank you for your time and
    I would appreciate a response. </font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>Thanks for the email. I get a ton, but not many as thought out
    and well presented. I play a necro, and while we may not agree on all points here, I
    certainly respect your opinions on them. </em></font></p>
    <p><font face='Arial'><em>Thanks again. </em></font></p>
