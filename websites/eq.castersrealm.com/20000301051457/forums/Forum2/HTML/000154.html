</FONT><HR>Apparently GZ forgot to finish his essay on the role of Wizards.  It's only been a month and he has already finished an Archmage post since the time he was allegedly working on it.  Any idea what happened to that?  I'd really love to see what Verant sees the class as, it looks an awful lot like a solo class by the spell list and description, but isn't very good at solo and ends up being a teleporting cannon, not even remotely a seeker of knowledge, nor often even the master of ANY form of damage.<P>------------------<BR>-------------------------<P>  Grimstaff Theurgist<P>-------------------------</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000154.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=GZ+and+the+role">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Baelish for supporting the majority of the posters who believe there are definate problems that need to be resolved for wizards.  I do however feel i owe no debt to GZ however for spending the time to look at wizards.  His job is to provide the things neccessary for caster classes to be effective in the game, and to fix any problems they have.  He does so each week by adding things to classes that the majority of players feel our fine as it is for now.  We just wish he would share the priorities we would put if we were in charge of the game.  For example wizards get 20+ area effect spells that can be rarely used at best.  This is somewhere near 1/4 of our entire spellbook rendered useless.  The same goes for our sight line which has no uses to date.  When you take into effect the problems with resist rates you can say that our direct damage is not usefull at some times.  This makes a totally mana dependent class, with nowhere to spend it.  Odviously this would happen for so long if the person in chrage would be looking at the class on paper and not from a player's viewpoint.  How many of us picked a wizard because of its description, without any experiance on how it plays.  GZ has probably done the same looking at the spells and seeing 400 mana for 1200 dmg x 5 = 6000 damage within 30 seconds, damn i shouldnt spend any time on this class, cause no other one can do that!  Unfortuantly thats a perfect world stat, which verant seems to base all their games properties on.  I am going into game devlopment as a career, and i know if i was a new employee, and was in charge of a huge role in a rpg, for example class balance, and I let 1/4 of the classes go to hell (wizards,rogues,shadowknights) i would be fired.  That is our complaint, and why we flame gz so often.  If he would just take some of his free time and play those classes at low, mid, and high levels, he would see the errors of his nerfs etc.  <BR>Thanks,<BR>Kevin "BaShildy" King<BR>-30th wizard Fennin Ro<BR>equivalent to 20th level necromancer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000154.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=GZ+and+the+role">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I agree.  I think that wizards deserve some  minor revisions in certain areas and we have had quite a few discussions on it.  The role that GZ and myself see wizards performing as a solo or group class is quite a different one.  <P>Because of this I have asked him to put together the dev teams view on wizards so we have an set footing to begin some serious discussions on in this area.  <P>I got a post from Graffe and another from Grimstaff on what they felt were the problems with the class so he could have something to work with in relation to how you perceive the class as players.<P>However, I can quite understandably see that he isn't going to pump a document out overnight.  Whatever he prints is going to be dissected into a million pieces by wizards so he has to get it right the first go in my opinion.  <P>I have nothing wrong with you picking what he eventually posts to pieces, it is the whole point of getting him to do it in the first place.  We just need a common ground to start from instead of 10 petitions, 6 sit ins, 30 different pleas for new spells (which is unlikely), and 100 ideas on changing existing spells (which is a lot more likely if anything is actually done).<P>I am keeping an eye on this matter and have been reminding him of it at least a couple of times a week.  I can't say exactly when it will be published, but it I assure you it will be.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000154.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=GZ+and+the+role">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Baelish please don't get defensive, it's just that way back when you mentioned by next week and we had heard absolutely nothing from him.  But no, he won't get any slack.  He might be your friend, but he hasn't really given Wizards a single reason to consider him such.  I can only hope his tone in this won't be one of arrogance, condescension, and rigidity.  But even Gordon is getting that way.<P>Perhaps it's a response to the vitriol that any statement they make recieves, or perhaps it comes from being in charge of something and having no accountability from your people.  It's hard to say, but Verant truly is not making friends.<P>------------------<BR>-------------------------<P>  Grimstaff Theurgist<P>-------------------------</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000154.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=GZ+and+the+role">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Ouch.<P>Feel free to continue pressuring Verant for the changes you think your class deserves by all means.<P>I was only asking for giving him a break re: the Wizard Article I have asked him to do, since he is doing it as a favour for me  not because he has an obligation to do it for any other reason.<P>In all seriousness at least the dev team IS communicating with the players, which is more than OSI did with UO for a long time.  I truly understand that you may feel frustrated that you think your class is being ignored/is a low priority.  Certainly if you looked at every patch message since release you would probably get this impression.<P>All I can say is I am trying to do my bit to get your voice heard - I can't do any more than that.  <P><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Baelish (edited 12-19-1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000154.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=GZ+and+the+role">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Baelish, dont take GT's comments personally, they weren't ment as an insult to you.  We dont have any personal flak against you, its against GZ.  We understand how a person in your power would be forced to defend GZ (to some extent) to get him to do positive things for us.  Thats a problem.  It is so absurd that GZ would think so high of himself that he would have almost no contact with the community, and of any that he does, its dodging of the most odvious questions, that even a newbie of the 2nd level would see that our points would be valid.  We are greatful you are taking up the burdon of having to never say your opinions in fear of having verant taking it the wrong way and cutting off contact.

</FONT><HR>We really appreciate everything Baelish, I guess this board is only avenue (hope) that Geoffrey Zatkins actually is listening and not just hearing.<P>Over the past Few months Grimstaff has brought up some extremely valid points and ideas. I my self have suggested some great ideas, ones that would not harm the game balance but would allow the Wizard class some dimension.  All these ideas could be implamented within 2 weeks....  <P>All one has to do is read what a wizard is about three times.. then go play a lvl 50 Wizard and FEEL the differance.<P>The Idea that as a wizard lvl's up he get Greater damage spells for greater amount of mana is STUPID and Flawed.  We should be getting more unique spells as we Level up.  The Wizard class starts to fail at lvl 24.<P>Why can't a lvl 50 Wizard have enough sense to study and master a mid damage spell for little mana. Ice Commet and Rend are 2.79 and 2.8 efficiency rating.  So with that in mind Why does a Wizard have to waste 300 mana to kill 4 Skeletons that just attcked him while meding ?<P>Lvl 44: Chill<BR>Casting Time: 1.8<BR>Mana: 50<BR>Damage: 135<P><BR>lvl 49 Personel based (PB): Fury<BR>Casting time: 1.8<BR>Mana: 120<BR>Damage: 200 x 4 creatures<BR>Re-casting time: 12.2<P>Note: This is a utility spell that is not battle intended, but would be memed by every wizard. Allows a wizard bring his fury down upon the Orcs Gnolls Skeletons and many sub 20 NPC that dare attck a lvl 49 Wizard.  It would put an end to the Wizard plight of being trained buy 4 Skeletons and having to waste 25% of his mana getting ride of them. (Enchanter/Mage pet handles these for their masters, Dmg is who we Master. This spell could be used in battle to help out if needed, Though with the extremely long re-cast time allows for 1 or 2 casts per battle.<P>Now it would take but 2 days for GZ to have these spells in the game.  They are not AWESOME, but give wizards a choice, and some versatility and allow for some what of a deversity in game tactics also.<P>BIGGER IS BETTER is an ignorant way to look at wizards !  Cunning and Quick !</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000154.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=GZ+and+the+role">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Thoughts from this newly lvl 49 wizard:<P>lvl 1-48 Wizard: Always trying to feel useful<P>lvl 49-50 Wizard: One KICKASS killing machine.<P>I am having a blast at lvl 49. Ice Comet is fast and destructive(Mana intensive OUCH need more mana or Clarity at lvl 49 hint hint  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"> )<P>Marker's Clash is a blast to use. Not only do you do 200dmg but do a long stun aswell.<P>Rend is ok but I rather use Conflagration.<P>It too 50 days 17 hours to feel on top of the world. To make a huge difference in fights(Even in Hate, I kicked major asrs)<P>But that doesnot justify why the other 48 lvls weren't as fun or as personally motivating. <P>Once you hit lvl 49 you will feel that finally you got what you deserved. I know I did. Even though I'm ripping through SGs, Clerics of Innoruuk or Fire Giants, I KNOW there was a huge price to pay before this and that was my 50 days of game play. <P>Now its the time to help those that are below lvl 49 feel justified. Let them have a taste of the power that only time/dedication/perservereance will give you in the end. <P>There were moments that I would have quit. Glad I didn't at the time.<P>Still lvl 49(besides the Ice Comet) doesn't have that much to offer. 2 dd spells, stun, evac, 2 AoE spells(from what I remember). Not much here. Kinda sad spell selection for a lvl 49 wizard no?  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>I STILL think we should have SOME form of a Focus item for Clarity. Flame all you want but in Hate you go OOM fast and there can still be 3 mobs left to fight, while you sit and med and watch your companions fall one by one. We went to Hate for 8 hours before we got a Enchanter, doh we still kicked arse but downtime was long.<P>And for GZ writing that article, I say he forgot. I know I forget to do things that I promised all the time. Or that he will do it after the holidays and says screw it. No idea I'm assuming(making an ass out of you and me  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"> ). <P>I still think they placed Wizards as a guide for all other classes during beta and after. That is why we are so poor before lvl 49. <P>No sir, I don't think I like it.<P>BLARG<P>Jinaar Drakhonen<BR>Lvl 49 Wizard of Bertoxxulous<BR>"I got me some mad skillz  know!"<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000154.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=GZ+and+the+role">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I play a Wizard and a Necro.  <P>My current Necro pet hits for quad 33's w/ a 21 delay (34 pet, 2 daggers, intensified), Then I can do 500 damage w/ 1 20 second Dot, root runners, and attempt minor crowd control at times. This is a blast because no one else can really do those things. Makes you feel good in a group.<P>However My Wizard is great in a group w/ his DDs but people will ALWAYS pick a Mage over a wizard.  Why?  Because a Mage can make a tank (pet) that rocks and his DDs do a fraction less damage than a Wizard. Having a Necro I KNOW how good pets are and so do all players at high lvls.  No other class should have DDs that close to a Wizard in damage when they also have a powerful pet.<P>Here are the problems:<P>#1 Wizard DD damages need to be increased for low and mid level spell ranks (lvl 49 is the only level where thier DDs are unmatched - AS IT SHOULD BE). Example: a lvl 34 Mage casting DDs that do 15-20 or so less damage than a Wizard but w/ a pet that can hit for 35's - you tell me who becomes a MUCH more desirable choice for a group member(the mage bolt spell actually does MORE damage than a Wizard can do at that lvl).  I think this could be ballanced if a Wizard's DDs at that level did 50-80 more damage than the Mages. Its a solid fact that pet damage adds up big time in a fight, hell, they do more melee damage than a cleric, druid, shaman, or bard (I know my Necro pet sure can). Since Wizards don't get pets, increase DD damages accross the board to compensate. Otherwise groups will continue to pass over Wizards for 'Wizards' that spawn thier on tank (pets).<P>#2 Make AE spells usefull in some form<BR>Sure there are occasions to use them but its RARE and you BETTER have an enchanter if you do. The occasions for AEs usefullness is far lower than the % of our Arsenal they take up<P>#3 Resists rates are just plain too high<BR>Nuff said, this one is a no-brainer<P>Teleports are ausome, but we are talking combat here   <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Oxoxo Wraithbane (edited 12-28-1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=2&topic=000154.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=Ask+The+Dev+Team&TopicSubject=GZ+and+the+role">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000154&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000154&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
