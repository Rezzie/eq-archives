<H2>Trog Goes to Grobb</H2>
<H5>By Emperor Trog</H5>
Trog sits down with some of the elders of grobb and drinks some of the bilgewater that they call Ale. He listens to the old trolls tell storys of old but doesnt see the one that he is looking for. As he looks over the group of trolls he is reminded that really he doesnt belong here much any more. The years of adventuring with the other races of Norrath have broadened his outlook and shown him much more of the world. When he was younger he thought of this trolls here and listened to their storys of battles and pillage. To him then these were the greats. Warriors and Shamans without equal. Feared throughout the land, but things had changed. He now knew that most of these trolls had never ventured further then the desert. Some had gone into the rathe mountains and had battled the giants but none had ventured further then this. He waited for the wise one, for only he of the elders had wandered the world. It was well known that he above all had seen more than any troll. He still remembers fondly of battling a Dragon and exploring. Trog knew if he was to get the advice he needed then it would have to be from him. His name was Tral. He was very old and rumors were that he had traveled with a group of adventurers that were not trolls. Most shunned him as his stories were so outlandish that most thought him crazy. Tral used to tell of his friends the ranger and the bard, but everyone thought that he was just addled as all knew that you could never get along with those people.
<P>
Trog looked up as an old Troll limped into the room and quietly set in the back. The bartender brought him a plate of food and a pitcher of ale. The old troll looked around the room and caught my eye. He just stared and then with a small smile he started eating his food and poured himself some ale. Trog waited until he was finished eating (as it is well known that you never interupt a troll when he is eating), and went over to his table. The old one smiled and said in a soft voice, "Trog I have been waiting for you." 
<P>
Trog sat down confused as he had only heard rumors and knew Tral only by reputation. They had never met. The old man poured Trog a glass of Ale and gave it to Trog and then sat back. He didn't say anything just sipped his ale and waited. His knowing eyes just watched Trog as he started to squirm. He really didnt know how to start this conversation and the old man was making him nervous. Maybe he was mad, and how did he know that I would come here to talk to him? The old man then smiled and said relax Trog. I have heard good things of you. I here that you have been chosen to lead the Darkflame Knights as Emperor. Trog blushed and said that no he was just a Guild Master not an emperor. The old man laughed and said GM, Emporer, or King it makes no difference you are doomed to failure. I was shocked. The old man had answered my question before I even asked him but what was it that made him think that I was doomed. He didnt know me or anything about me.
<P>
The old man then started rambling on about the days of old. I thought I would leave as the man didnt seem to make any sense but then he grabbed me by the arm and his eyes lit up. "Trog you have been chosen. You are the first since the glory days of old. You were chosen by those that never choose trolls. The storys tell that a troll will be chosen to lead the forces of good and he shall find the treasure of old. You Trog if you do not find this treasure are doomed to failure and all that depend on you will perish. Do not fail in this. Use all of your resources and friends to find this treasure and with it you will have the power to take your friends into greatness." At that the old man slumped to the table and started to snore. Trog finished his ale and thought a min. Treasure, this man must be crazy, but how did he know that I was chosen as GM and how did he know who I was? Maybe I need to talk to him some more to find out where I would start to look for this treasure.
<P>
The old Troll looked like many of the elders and sounded totally mad. What if there was some truth to what he said. He had traveled far and heard lots of storys and seen more then any other troll. At that time the old troll lifted his head and started talking.
<P>
In da days of old the Bashers were great. Many gathered to do battle and joined with the other evil races to overthrow the lesser races. Great armies were gathering with Troll, Ogres, Darkelfs, and Necromancers of all races. They met on a common ground and conquered most of the continent. It should have been enough but it was not. They got greedy. The leader of the combined forces was a Troll Shaman by the name of Toburg. You Trog are an ancestor of this shaman and could possibly be the reason that you have been chosen. Togurg was an unusuall Troll as he was very intellegent and had great wisdom. He was a good emperor but the forces that he lead were hard to control. They lusted for blood. While Toburg wanted to force the good races into allowing all to live together the lesser leaders just wanted to exterminate them. Toburg had a talasmin that gave him great power over all of his troops. While he had it his power was supreme but it was to Toburgs credit that he never misused this power. He had heard that there was a conspiracy to over throw him as many of the dark races were tired of not destroying the cities that they conquered. They wanted the blood of all the good races and recipes of Halflings, and elves were popping up and many of the soldiers were eating the fallen.
<P>
Toburg knew that his days were numbered. This was not the time. People were not ready to live in peace and harmony with each other so he took the talasmin and hid it. Toburg knew that someday would come a leader that could unite all the races and where there would still be bigotry and hatred there would not be the constant war that was now going on. He figured that there would need to be a path for the new leader to follow and that he would need the talasmin if he would want to succeed. Toburg went deep into the mountains and found a holy socerer and asked for help. The sorcerer said gather some of your trusted friends and bring them to me. Think then no more on this subject good King I will take care of the rest. Only those most worthy will every find the talasmin. Toburg brought several of his closest friends. It was a strange crew as most thought his friends were trolls and ogres but they were from all races and classes. The Sorcerer then planted into the mind of each of the friends a message that would be passed from generation to generation but unknown to each what the message was. The friends then asked the Sorcerer how will our ancesters be able to give this message to those that are worthy how do they choose. The Sorcerer said it will happen without their knowledge. If they are in a special place and hear a special word then the message will become clear. What if they just tell the message to all that will listen. The Sorcerer said the message will be unknown to them as they dont even know that they have it or what it means. They will recite it from a trance. If you were to ask them about it they wouldnt be able to tell you. They will be unknowing carriers that will only be able to tell the message if the place and key word is exactly correct. There are many of you here so in order to find the talasmin you would have to collect all of the clues to provide the keys to unleash the power of the talasmin. This is the best that I can do.
<P>
The old man started to drift off again. Trog shook him awake. How do we start? Who are these people? What can I do now? The old man just drifted off to sleep and mumbled something about sp...... that Trog couldnt understand. 
<P>
Trog paced the floor. He would need to search the land. If this power were available then it could really help the guild. He would need help, but where to start? He would have to wait till this old man woke up and hopefully he would have some clue of where to at least start. Maybe a list of the old friends and we could track them down. Well there was nothing that he could do now except wait.
