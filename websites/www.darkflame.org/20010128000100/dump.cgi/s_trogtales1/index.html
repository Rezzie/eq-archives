<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>A band of young adventurers awaits the coming of the leader of the Darkflame Knights; they stand amid the sands of the Southern Desert of Ro, upon one of the transportation portals of the wizards of Norrah. Trog their leader had been getting steadily weaker as his sickness grows and just a few days before had put out the call for volunteers to aid him in a quest that might lead to his cure. Finally Trog arrives in front of them and begins to speak.</P>
<P>Trog says, "Hear yea all this be the way." Minze listens intently.</P>
<P>Trog says, "Go all to Rivervale and find yea a cleric of Brell. She be young and not too eager to travel. She is also very inexperienced." Karibdis says, "Are ye sure this priest will be able to aid thee?" </P>
<P>Trog says, "From Rivervale you need to go to Blackburrow. In black burrow at the bottom of the pool there be a ring of power." Celebron says, "Ahh the silver ring I have heard tell of that." Minze remembers getting beaten up badly at the bottom of the Blackburrow pool. Karibdis says, "And of the gnolls that guard it." Chantor says, "Aye, heard there be a few fish there as well." Trog says, "If you get the ring of power and the cleric wears the ring of power I have heard that the gods will bestow her the strength to heal the poison coursing through my veins."</P>
<P>Minze says, "Where will you be resting Trog?" Toben says, "Aye my Lord does this cleric have a name?" Trog says, "Protect this young cleric well and have patience with her." Celebron says, "We shall do our best to aid you sir." Kint says, "Huff puff." Trog says, "The clerics name is Iown."</P>
<P>Trog says, "Hail little Kint." Toben says, "Aye thy will be done me Lord." Karibdis tells the group, "Hehe." Kint says, "Howdy." Toben waves at Kint.  Chantor pokes Kint. Karibdis nods at Kint. Chantor says, "Heya brudder."  Kint says, "Hello."</P>
<P>Celebron says, "When we have the Cleric and the ring where shall we find you." Trog says, "I shall be here resting." Celebron says, "rest ye well and fear not with this mighty band we can not fail."</P>
<P>Kint nods at Trog. Trog says, "If you are here you are good or you are dead" Karibdis says, "Understood" Toben says, "Understood." Minze thinks Kint reminds him of Biggis. Celebron says, "how many of us are there here?" Minze glances at Kint. Trog says, "If I find dat you are a spy in my midst little one I shall strike you down myself." Gaena grins. Karibdis grins evilly at Kint. Celebron says, "We need to form a group or two and find our why to the home of the halflings."</P>
<P>Trog says, "The group of adventurers have received their instructions and I wish them god speed and have now sent them on their way."</P>
<P>Chantor glares at Kint with distrust. Trog says, "Go with my blessing." Toben bows before Trog. Minze says, "We will do what we can Trog." Celebron bows before Trog. Jolith says, "Aye, may Rodcet watch over you all." Karibdis says, "Thanke Lord and rest ye well for now." Chantor says, "We won’t fail ye Trog." Chantor bows before Trog. Karibdis bows before Trog. Gaena says, "Two groups of three then?" Trog says, "Gud luck all." Toben says, "I would recommend one group run interference for second group with cleric." Silently and without a backward glance Kint leaves the band, apparently unseen.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Withir says, "I do not need luck."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Toben says, "Aye one group be the fighter types guarding the second." Celebron says, "aye that is a good idea." Chantor says, "Id be needin on the wimpy caster group then, gotta defend em." Gaena says, "Ok." Gaena says, "Let me know when the sows run out." Celebron says, "where did that rogue go?" Gaena says, "Though my mana is limited I will do my best to keep them on." Minze says, "Good question." Chantor says, "Shall we be off then?" Chantor says, "Lets be off." Toben tells the group, "Aye Toben says, "Aye."</P>
<P>Celebron says, "on to Rivervale then my good friends." Gaena says, "Yes but which way." Karibdis says, "Hmm lead the way Celebron." Gaena says, "Through the desert back to Freeport?" </P>
<P>Trog says, "I have sent 6 brave adventurers off to Rivervale to find the cleric told of by the gods."</P>
<P>Chantor says, "Ack, help, a tarantula is on me." Karibdis says, "This heat is most unpleasant." Toben says, "We should keep closer." Chantor says, "Come back fer me, poisoned." Karibdis says, "Where are ye Chantor?" </P>
<P>A desert madman begins to cast a spell. A desert madman says "Damn my eyes! You’re just another mirage!" A desert madman begins to cast a spell. Karibdis's skin ignites. A desert madman is lacerated by steel. A desert madman has been slain by Karibdis!</P>
<P>Chantor says, "Whew, thought id be a goner." Minze says, "Don’t you guys get tired from running so much?" Chantor says, "Best stay closer methinks." Toben says, "Aye we should stay closer together." Gaena says, "Come and follow me." Celebron says, "I have Kari with me."</P>
<P>Karibdis says, "An ambush already." Celebron says, "a madman attacked him." Chantor says, "Lets be off." Chantor casts a spell that charms the madman into obeying him. Chantor says, "No time for him, he is bent to my will for now." Toben says, "I suggest we slow it down to keep track of each other."</P>
<P>Gaena begins to cast a spell. Toben feels better. Toben bows before Gaena. Minze says, "We should walk and only run when someone has to catch up." Toben says, "Where did Chantor go?" Celebron says, "Aye "Chantor says, "Aye, I’m a bit tired." Gaena says, "He went to the other side." Chantor says, "I’m beside ya, just a bit north." Karibdis flips through his grimoire. Celebron says, "Chantor must be resting on the other side of this hill." Celebron says, "Shall we join him?" Gaena says, "Yes let us." Minze says, "Though I realize Trog is ill and must be helped as soon as possible it is better to be a whole group and make it than to be a partial group picked apart by bandits" Karibdis says, "Would be best." The group enters Oasis of Marr. Toben says, "Chantor is here to my left." Chantor says, "Aye, I see ya."</P>
<P>Gaena says, "Hail." Dracus says, "Hail and well met fellow travelers, and welcome to my neck of the woods, Dracus Darkfiend, master thief at your service how may I help you?" Celebron says, "And who might ye be sir?" Dracus says, "A rogue who makes his living off the sands on the oasis." Minze says, "You could clear us a path through this land m’lord." Toben puts hand on chin. Dracus says, "Consider it done fellow my friends." Chantor says, "Perhaps we had better split a bit, allow our new friend to join us." Toben says, "I have heard of giants in this land maybe ye can help us steer clear of them." Celebron says, "Thank ye good sir for this land is full of dangers." </P>
<P>Chantor feels a growing distrust of rogues. Karibdis says, "Are we to blindly trust this person?" Dracus says, "I know this land well, been here many moons, I would be more than happy to accompany you on your journey." Minze says, "Rogues sneak about in the shadows, he walked up and offered his services perhaps he is a friend." Karibdis says, "He seems almost too eager to aid us." Chantor says, "I’ve seen him around, never taken from me, seems to be a good chap besides he profession." Gaena says, "He is a fellow guild mate how dare you disparage him without cause Karibdis." Celebron says, "I say we accept his help." Toben says, "As for myself I do not know the way thru and none of the position of the large ones." Karibdis says, "I for one will keep mine eye on him." Gaena says, "Let us go for Trog weakens as we dally here." Celebron says, "Lead on good sir." Toben says, "Minze no one should be alone I shall group with you." Minze says, "Come with us Dracus we are off to Rivervale." Dracus says, "Let us be off then perhaps one of you would be so kind as to explain the cause of your journey to me? who is this Trog you speak so highly of?" Minze says, "A trusted friend in need of our aid." Chantor says, "Slow down little one." Chantor says, "Can’t keep up with these legs."</P>
<P>Avrohom slashes a deepwater caiman. A deepwater caiman bites Avrohom. Chantor says, "Ack, those things could take me in one bite." Toben says, "They would make good boots I think." Gaena says, "If the speed of the wolf leaves anyone let me know." Dracus says, "Keep moving my friend, do not stand still and they will not harm you, keep moving, that is the only rule in these parts." Karibdis says, "They do look impressive aye." Karibdis says, "And hungry to boot." </P>

Gaena slashes an orc raider. an orc raider has been slain by Gaena!</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Withir says, "Enjoy my present friends," the last word is said with a sneer.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Toben says, "Brace ye self people I think a ambush is near."</P>
<P>Dracus says, "I shall scout ahead, stay here for now and rest up."</P>
<P>Toben says, "Getting some water." Karibdis says, "I do not feel at ease at all here." Chantor says, "Perhaps we should stop in a nearby town to get supplies." Toben kneels down. Celebron says, "rest ye me friends and I shall stand guard." Toben remains standing watching for those pesky crocs. Minze says, "Aye we’ve traveled far without rest I do know of a town just up ahead." Dracus says, "The nearest town I can think of is Freeport, a city of man, we shall stop there for a while to get supplies."</P>
<P>Karibdis says, "What have ye found brave Toben?" Toben says, "Filling up the canteen." Celebron says, "I see an Orc on the horizon." Karibdis says, "The water be salty and will do thee no good." Toben says, "Aye I filter it thru fungus." Gaena says, "Aye we must get supplies in the city called Freeport." Chantor says, "Careful all, a madman is near, "I can hear his ranting from wear I sit." Karibdis says, "Too battle." Dracus says, "I shall steal from this madman, to see if he may have some useful supplies." A madman begins to cast a spell. Chantor casts a spell and charms the madman, binding him to his side.</P>
<P>Chantor says, "I say we let him kill himself, die at his own blade." Celebron says, "onward then." "Dracus says, "I have taken a flask of water from his belt pouch, is anyone thirsty?" Toben says, "Chantor where are ye going?" Minze wipes the sweat form his brow. Chantor says, "Seeking a death for my friend here." Chantor's spell breaks at this moment freeing the madman from its influence. A madman says "Damn my eyes! You’re just another mirage! A madman says "Its Gnomes like you who have ruined your own lands, You’ll not ruin mine!" Celebron says, "It attacks to battle." A madman hits Chantor. Dracus pierces a madman and slays it.</P>

Gaena says, "They lie still, they are no match for us." Chantor says, "He had some water on em." Karibdis says, "I’ve never seen the likes of these before." Toben says, "This place seems to be full of followers of Innoruck." Minze spits on the Dervish’s corpse, saying, "We should rest in town it would be much safer."</P>
<P>Gaena says, "Aye let us move out of the desert." Chantor says, "To Freeport then." Karibdis says, "I say we make haste to this town." Celebron says, "aye onward." Minze says, "Stick together." Dracus says, "I shall hide in the shadows when we reach the town, the guards there… how should we say… are a little too eager for my liking."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Withir says, "Demesion SHUT UP, before I turn your insides into your outsides."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Minze’s stomach begins to grumble loudly. Suddenly a dark elf rushes toward him attacking. Dorn B`Dynn bashes Minze. Dorn B`Dynn punches Toben. Minze says, "Help! Dorn!" Dorn B`Dynn punches Toben. Gaena slashes Dorn B`Dynn. Toben says, "BACKSTABEER DARKELF!" Dorn B`Dynn's skin ignites. Dracus pierces Dorn B`Dynn.

The Indigo Brotherhood shall find you. Everyone looks at each other uneasily at these final words.</P>
<P>Karibdis says, "A dark elf assassin." Minze says, "Nice work team." Celebron says, "A foul Dark one." Toben says, "I seen him coming at your back Minze." Celebron says, "Who is this Dorn Dynn?" Dracus says, "My my, what have a gotten myself into now? a dark one attacks us? perhaps we should rest in Freeport, maybe I can learn more about your journey there." Toben says, "A follower of the dark one of course." Chantor says, "I don’t associate with his type, so couldn’t tell ya." Minze says, "Aye we have had words before but were never acted upon, figures a Dark elf to hide in a tent and come at my back." Gaena says, "Aye I think the walls of Freeport sound good, especially since the night comes upon us." Celebron says, "On to Freeport my friends to rest in the safety there." Toben says, "He paid for his cowardice." Minze says, "I met him for the first time in Crow’s in Qeynos and we were kicked out of the bar." </P>
<P>The group comes upon a band of green at the edge of the desert. Karibdis says, "Ah finally some greens again." Toben says, "Aye feels firm upon the feet." Chantor says, "Ill stop by the inn to get supplies." Celebron says, "I see the town ahead."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Withir says, "Demesion what are you doing?" Demesion trembles while walking slowly away from Withir. "Sorry, m'lord" Withir says, "LORD, YOUR LORD?" Demesion says, "I didn’t mean anything by it master!" Kint says, "A minotaur!"</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>The group wanders towards the walls of Freeport some entering Inns upon the way to reprovision. Toben says, "We seem to have lost a few here." Dracus says, "I will follow suit in the shadows. Let’s just say these guards have a few less gold than they started with a while ago." Dracus laughs. Celebron says, "Minze, Kari and I are by the inn here." Minze says, "Ill meet you in town I recall there being a price on Dorn’s head ." Minze says, "Meet at the gates." Gaena says, "Let us move into town." Chantor says, "You guys head in, I’ll join you shortly." Chantor calls out to Minze, "Nay, Minze can help ya" and joins him.</P>
<P>The band enters East Freeport. Toben says, "Minze I need to develop a affinity for this place." Dracus says, "I do as well." Karibdis says, "This is a town? Looks more like a cesspool to me." Gaena says, "Ah I can do that for yea Darcus." Karibdis says, "Vagabonds at every corner of the street." Celebron says, "We must complete our errands with all due speed." Karibdis says, "And I swear the guard just took a bribe from a dark one." Dracus says, "Hahahaha more gold for me these guards make me laugh." Minze says, "We should rest here for the night." </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Withir says, "Draconia are your spells at the ready?" Draconia says, "Yes they are all set." Withir says, "Good good all is ready then." Kint says, "My daggers are at the ready m’lord." Demesion says, "When do we get to draw blood m'lady?" Withir sighs at the m'lord comment, and says "Kint do I look like a man to you?"</P>
<P>Withir fingers the edge of her axe. Kint says, "Sorry m'lady ‘tis the heat." Demesion laughs, "Hehehehaha! Muhahahaha."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Celebron says, "I don’t know how long Trog has before he begins to weaken." Dracus says, "Let us make due with haste then, I do not wish to see your friend suffer." Karibdis says, "Where are we to gather friend Chantor?" Gaena says, "We have some time, the forest of Kithicor may not be passed in the dark." Karibdis says, "I for one am as ready as I can be." Celebron says, "I think the tunnel route will be faster then trying to make our way through the city." Dracus says, "So, what is this journey for anyway? I’m still quite in the dark."</P>
<P>Gaena says, "Has everyone gotten the supplies they needed?" Minze says, "Not yet." Chantor says, "Aye, all stocked and ready to go." Dracus says, "I steal the supplies I need, more gold to do other thing." Toben glares at Dracus. Karibdis says, "Are we staying here till daybreak ? I loathe travelling in the dark of night." Toben nods at Karibdis agreeing, "Can be unsafe." Minze says, "That would be best as we have a long journey ahead of us and not a whole lot of safe places to rest besides here."</P>
<P>A messenger comes up to Celebron and hands him a message. Chantor says, "What does it say?" Toben says, "Aye who was that Celebron." Celebron says, "I think we should venture to the tunnel between Ro and the commons. We must hurry the message said Trogs conditions to worsening." </P>
<P>Toben says, "Aye lets be on our way." Celebron says, "Minze?" Minze says, "I was helping some weary travelers, meet you at the other gate." Karibdis says reluctantly, "let us be on our way then." Toben says, "Dracus do ye know the way." Dracus says, "Lets us leave this place and hurry to your friend, night shall not stop us, after all, I love the darkness of the skies, I do indeed." Dracus says, "To west Freeport my friends." Gaena says, "We are going through the tunnel Minze." Minze says, "Alright." Karibdis says, "Are we ready?" Gaena says, "Back into the desert then there is a tunnel there to the commonlands." Chantor says, "Aye." Celebron says, "to The tunnel then my friends." Karibdis says, "Then were off." The band leaves Freeport and reenters Northern Desert of Ro.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Demesion says, "Ouch! how do you expect me to obey you acting like that AHHH ! hey! arg !" Draconia says, "Fear not brother, she knows better." Withir says, "And they think they can rescue Trog." Withir laughs coldly, "I pity them." Kint says, "Aye that was my strongest poison." Demesion says, "I pity all in your way Withir, and I’m starting to regret this reunion." Draconia says, "With my help." Withir says, "Ambition is a strong passion. One I will not let go of. Tell me again how you slipped the poison into the dish I so enjoy hearing it. And what did you use?" Withir says, "Patients dear Demesion" Demesion sighs. Kint says, "A mixture of Darkweed snake poison and the giant spiders oh Everfrost. It took me weeks to gather the poison." Withir says, "Aye and a good job you did." Kint says, "And as soon al the ol dirty troll took a bite of it I ran." Withir says, "Oooo that story almost settles my bloodlust." Draconia says, "Haha those steaks were so greasy and fat that the poison soaked in perfectly." Demesion says, "I yern for the feel of fire on my fingertips! WHERE ARE THEY ?" Withir says, "Though that pitiful excuse for a god thinks she can save him, and did you see the group he picked? Fools, the bunch of them. Though I am starting to wonder about the company I keep as well." Withir looks about her.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Toben says, "Compatriots where may ye all be?" Gaena says, "Back in the no ro desert headed to the tunnel in the mountain." Celebron says, "Meet us at the tunnel in the desert." Toben says, "Dracus they seem to have taken a different path." Dracus says, "We shall meet you at the tunnel then, the commonlands side." Dracus says, "It appears that way let us go." Celebron says, "this tunnel is long friends." The group enters East Commonlands.</P>
<P>Celebron says, "I think I smell the stench of death about here." Celebron says, "be careful as we go through this place." Chantor says, "I’m here with Minze." Dracus says, "Come out of the tunnel friends, it seems crowed." Toben says, "Do we have all here?" Dracus says, "My feet donut feel as fast anymore." Minze says, "The battle with Dorn taxed me quite a bit and I must rest." Celebron says, "It is close to morning friends and we still have a long journey ahead." Minze says, "Alright I am ready." Gaena says, "Aye, let us wait nearer Kithicor forest for dawn." Celebron says, "If we are swift it is possible we can get to the forest by dawn." Toben says, "I follow you as I never have been in this part of the world."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Withir says, "How was Trog the last time you looked upon him Draconia?" Draconia says, "I swear if I seen a greener troll, It would be Trog." Demesion says, "If I get a good look at him, he’ll not be green from de poison, but black from my fires!" Withir says, "Deme get OUT of my lap NOW!" Kint says, "Aww oaiu Karana I hate da rain." Withir says, "I was worried the poison wouldn’t work trolls are strong. Though Trog has fallen from grace among his brothers." Kint says, "I would guess he is near death." Demesion says, "Nothing a bit of magic can’t enhance!" Withir says, "He is weak." Withir sits sharpening her blades. Demesion says, "Tell me again how it will be when Trog is dead and we’ll have control of the knights of the Darkflame?" Withir says, "Rouge, assassin and war deme just the way you like it." Withir says, "The fighting will be continuos." Withir says, "Just the way I like it."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>The group hears a screeching sound come from the walls of the tunnel. Gaena says, "What was that noise?" Karibdis says, "What’s that sound?" Celebron says, "Friends let us see what made that noise." Chantor says, "I heard a screeching sound from the tunnel." The group now feels a very cold draft sift through the tunnel"</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Demesion says, "How much longer must we wait lady Withir? you promised much bloodshed!"</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Celebron says, "I smell the stench of death." Chantor says, "I don’t like the feel of this." Minze says, "We should press on." Chantor stands back and watches the others move into the tunnel. Toben says, "Aye Minze is back lets press on." Celebron peers carefully about the tunnel. Everyone in the group slows down as they weaken. They can only walk as they do not have the strength to run. Gaena says, "What is this strange spell that weakens me? what is here?" Toben says, "Let us leave this place and press on." Dracus says, "Let us get out of this tunnel, perhaps our strength will return." Celebron says, "it smells of death my friends." Gaena says, "Aye." The band starts to see images and looks at their partners and they all seem to be changing shapes. Celebron says, "what is happening?" Toben says, "Let me help you Dracus." Celebron says, "You look strange my friends." Gaena says, "Ah the sunlight, we need to hurry to make it through the forest of Kithicor." Celebron says, "I think something has happened to me." Toben says, "I feel so strange." Celebron says, "let us try to get to the forest while we can." Gaena says, "Aye it was passing strange in there." Celebron says, "On to the forest then."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Withir says, "AHH Jolith ! the paladin." Demesion says, "Let me burn him lady, I beg thee." Withir says, "You know not what you have stepped into." Jolith says, "Stepped into, do you think you own this path?" Demesion says, "Please lady, I yearn for his heart!" Withir says, "If I succeed I will own it all, blasphemous paladin." Withir says, "All in good time Deme all in good time." Kint hides. Jolith says, "Own all?" Demesion says, "We outnumber him lady! if we let him go he’ll tell the others, he MUST die!" Withir says, "He will not he knows not what is going to happen." Demesion says, "Remove your hand from your sword knave! lest I burn it off!" Withir says, "The paladin draws his sword and I put mine away? What kind of good are you?" Withir grins wickedly at Jolith. Jolith watches the group before him, paying more attention to the darkelf than the others but not drawing his blade yet. Demesion stares intently at the paladin, fingers ready for a spell. Draconia readies her dagger. Withir says, "Long way from home are you not paladin?" Demesion shifts his eyes back to Withir, for some kind of signal. Withir says, "That would have been folly my blade would devour you." Jolith says, "State your cause here, who are you." Kint says, "My poison would flow through yer vain paladin." Withir says, "Why, I’m Withir of course." Withir says, "And as to my purpose, what business is it of yours?" Draconia says, "I have seen many paladins in your filthy city you call Freeport. What you stand for is a joke, don’t think for a moment your kind will</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2> </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff">conquer the army of the undead." Demesion says, "Can I burn him m'lady? he monks me." Jolith sneers at the threats of the small ones’ "I grow tired of your Imps threats, call him off or send him forward, but I will not listen to his bark all eve." Withir holds Demesion by the robe. Kint sifts through the paladin’s purse. Jolith backs up a bit, trying to keep the group within his sight. Kint says, "Get goin paladin." Demesion says, "I want to blacken that shiny armor of his with the ashes of his skin!" Withir says, "He is overzealous, he must save himself for the fight ahead," Withir glares at Demesion. Kint says, "Leave this place paladin" Demesion says, "He runs? coward ." Withir says mockingly, "We shall let you pass begone from here m'lord." Draconia says, "Silly Jolith, as we speak the army of the undead will ambush your friends if nightfall reaches the forest before they can make an exit into safety." Jolith grits his teeth and escapes into the tunnels, knowing that reaching the city is more important then dealing with this bunch, for now. Kint says, "I scared him off." Draconia says, "Haha." Withir says, "It was not his time soon though." Kint says, "Aye that I did I seen it in his eyes." Demesion says, "No Kint, it was me that scared him off, did you see how he cowered at me? muhahaha!" Kint says, "Nay he saw the poison dripin of my blade."</P>

Karibdis says, "What do ye mean haunted?" Celebron says, "Evil lurks there we must be sure to travel in daylight." Dracus says, "It is daybreak, let us hurry before the undead come for our souls." Karibdis says, "Haun.. haunted ye say?" Toben says, "Let us go friends." Celebron says, "Onward." Gaena tells the group, "Let us go." The group enters Kithicor Woods.</P>
<P>Toben says, "Uummmmmm there is a stench of evil to this accursed fog."</P>
<P>Karibdis says, "Why does it feel so chilly here?" Celebron says, "I advise staying on the paths here." Gaena says, "This place is evil stay to the path and keep moving to Rivervale." Celebron says, "The road is evil." Minze says, "We should travel while it is still light." Dracus says, "Let us move."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#00ffff"><P>Jolith makes his ways through the darkness of the tunnels. "Now is not the time for this Jo," he mutters to himself, "You have to make sure they get through the undead woods before night sets in."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Kint wants more of that platinum he got out of da paladins purse." Draconia says, "Fear not my friends, the undead will take them, the sun is fading away as we speak." Withir says, "That would save me much trouble." Kint says, "That would save me poison." Demesion says, "But I wanted to burn some goody goodies!" Kint says, "Soon enough." Draconia says, "My undead friends have not failed me yet. darkness shall rule over all." Withir says, "All in good time my little gnome." Withir says, "Remove your weapons little ones we do not want to look menacing." Withir says, "Move your skeleton follower up the hill Draconia." Draconia says, "As you wish."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Unnoticed by the group one of their companions falls back in the woods and is lost to them. A wandering skeleton attacks the group. A skeleton hits Toben and Dracus whirls around and backstabs it slaying it. Karibdis says, "A tunnel in a wood?" Toben says, "I shall check out tunnel" Karibdis says, "Careful Toben " Celebron says, "Where does this lead"</P>

Celebron says, "let us all go then." The group enters Rivervale and meets one of the renowned members of the Darkflame Knights awaiting them. Faludir says, "Hail fellow knights." Toben says, "Ahhh halflings !" Gaena snaps to attention and salutes Faludir crisply. Faludir bows before Gaena. Toben says, "Must be Rivervale." Celebron says, "Greetings Good Sir."</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#00ffff"><P>Jolith moves into the city, past the guards who stand watch there. he finds no welcome, nor does he expect it. This is not his hometown and they are none too fond of outsiders here.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Gaena says, "Greetings Faludir." Faludir says, "I can bind ye here, my salute to you who have made it through the haunted forest outside our humble vale."

</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>Demesion slowly sips from his stein, waiting to be able to use his art. Withir touches her blades, drawing blood from her fingers with a sigh of delight at the pain. Kint says, "I will never understand the likes of yer people Withir." Withir says, "Nor should you Kint." Demesion says, "Must we wait forever? it feels like eons since I’ve had the sent of burnt flesh creeping into my nostrils!"</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Faludir says, "Choose a goodly place for me to bind yer spirits to." Celebron says, "I would prefer a bit further in this tunnel is cramped." Faludir says, "Will here do good Knights?" Celebron says, "this would be wonderful." Toben says, "Aye this looks good."</P>
<P>Jolith smiles to himself as he sees the small group enter the city.</P>
<P>Celebron says, "What an interesting town this is." Celebron says, "everything is so small." Jolith says, "Did all make it, are all accounted for then?" Faludir says, "Good luck to ye on yer quest, do any others require a bind to our friendly town?" Toben says, "Now we look for Iown." Chantor says, "Nay friend, just learned to be doing it meself no." Celebron says, "Thank you good Faludir." Celebron bows before Faludir. Faludir says, "Tis naught for fellow travelers." Faludir bows before Celebron. Gaena says, "Thank you for your help Faludir." Faludir bows before Toben. Chantor says to Jolith, "Hello knight." Jolith makes a motion to the group as he draws towards them. Chantor bows before Jolith. Toben bows before Faludir. Karibdis bows before Faludir. Toben says, "Thank thee kind sir," to Faludir. Jolith says, "Did all make it, are all accounted for?" Faludir says, "Good luck then, may Karana speed your path to your destination." Faludir begins to cast a spell and creating a mystical portal leaves them.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>&#9;Celebron says, "Where is Minze friends?" Gaena says, "Minze has yet to make it, where might he be?" Chantor says, "Nay, the rogue seems to have become lost." Jolith says, "Lord Minze, is he still in the woods?" Toben says, "I would think if she is a cleric the cleric guild." Toben says, "Should we split up and search?" Celebron says, "I will try to track her though what has become of Minze." Jolith says, "It is almost nightfall, and I suggest you all stay within this city till the day returns, but what of Minze did he enter the woods with you all?" Celebron says, "Is he still in the forest?" Celebron says, "Yes he did." Chantor says, "Aye, he was in the forest." Gaena leaves the group and goes to the entrance of Kithicor Woods, there she looks out at the deepening gloom wishing for Minze to appear. She ponders searching for him then reluctantly gives up the idea knowing that it would just mean two lost members. She is much too young to venture into these woods at night, hoping that Minze has made it back to the commonlands she rejoins the group.</P>

Jolith says, "Let me offer this advice, I came apron a group in the Beholder Maze, and I expect they are of no good to your quest." Toben says, "Is he in Kithicor?" Chantor says, "Last I saw." Jolith says, "Do not venture from the Thicket while it is dark." Toben says, "Then continue to misty thicket I shall go back to Kithicor and look." Jolith says, "I will join you in Kithcor." Toben bows before Jolith. Gaena says, "I was in Kithicor looking I believe that he is headed back to the commons, he was lost." Celebron says, "Minze must make his way here when the sun raises again." </P>
