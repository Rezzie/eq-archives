Welcome to the home of the Darkflame Knights of Rodcet Nife.<br>
<br>

<p>Our guild has grown considerably since it's creation.  We now have quite a number of members, spanning all levels.  We are still accepting new members, though.  If you are interested in joining the Darkflame Knights, simply register, and we will contact you.  It may be a little bit until you hear from us, as we have slowed down the recruitment process.<br>
I really must apologize for the lack of updates.  I will try to post a little more regularly from now on.  Like many of us, I have been so busy in the world of Norrath that it's a struggle to take time off for other things (I will note that I am able to update now primarily because the servers are down).<br>
Almost all features of the site are up and running,including a forum for guild discussion (read: ranting and raving).<br><h5>--Aael</h5>

<P>
<P>
Unfortunately, we seem to be missing some of the fine applicants that try to get into our guild. Please, if you haven't had prior contact with the DFK apart from applying here, try to actively contact DFK members and talk to them, group with them and get to know them and more importantly get them to know you.<BR>
