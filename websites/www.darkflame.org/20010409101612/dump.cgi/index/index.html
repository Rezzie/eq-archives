<H2> Plane of Hate and The Mines of Nurga </H2>

Tonight at sundown (8EST) the senior forces of the Flames will gather at the Soutern Ro portal to enter the plane on Innoruuk. Increase activity in Kiticor forrest and lesser faydark revealed that the dark leader had spies in the taverns we feasted at and overheard our plans as one ale to many had loosened our tongues.<P>

But even with him prepared he cannot stop us from knocking at his house, stomping it down and storming his "home".<P>

Our Darkflame Knights in the middle of the adventuring career are following a lead found on a spy and are heading to the Mines of Nurga. Also it was heard that an abandant ruin in frontier mountains can serve as a temporary home for those that prefer the swords & axes. The Darkflame Knights should establish camp there 1 and a half hours after sundown (9:30EST) and plan the campaign to break into the kobold dominated mines.<p>

So come prepared, it will be a tough battle tonight. We will need good support from our <h4> cleric and enchanter</h4> friends. Sharpen your blades and study your spellbooks, we will need it.<p>

Please contact Matteo, Bikkin or me if you have any questions or want to invite someone. <p>

<H2> Phinigel Autropos on the Darkflame Knights black list</H2>

This Sunday, Phinigel Autropos, will take his last breather. At 2:30pm Eastern the Darkflame Knights will prepare for battle against the master of the underwater lair. Even the four swirlspine guardians that surround him, or the first wave of seahorses he will put in our way will not stop us, he will find his grave in his own rooms. <p>

Prepare for battle, collect enough fish scales to hold the breath long enough, sharpen your weapons and practise your most powerful spells, because we will need everything we have to defeat him. He is a high wizard that brought death to many, many citizens of Norrath, but not any longer. <p>

Salut good Flames, its is time.<p>

<H2> King Tormax welcomes the first Darkflames</H2>

After returning from a several week long compaign against the Dains and an infiltration of the fortress of Dain Frostreaver we were greeted by King Tormax himself.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.darkflame.org/pics/kingtorm.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.darkflame.org/pics/skingtor.jpg"></IMG></A><p>

Now a whole Darkflame Knights delegation is in talks with King Tormax where the next campaign is to be held. Currently the King is asking us to explore an ice cave in Greater Divine. With enough forces we could push in Velektor's lair and collect some Kobold paws for the Giants archive collection. Prior to reaching the kobolds we have to battle through a spider invested labyrinth. Be sure to walk careful on the ice.<p>

The King is asking for an attempt on Saturday but advised us of the following:<p>
o The spiders seems to be about as strong as the King's younger warriors who have trained for 35-45 icy years<br>
o The kobolds match the King's senior guards that have seen anywhere from 48 to 58 years of war against the Dains.<p>

Tormax also said that a younger delegation should be tasked with keeping the spider's at bay and the aged warriors should carefully walk the trapez walk over the ice maze to the kobold lair. Beware though, these guys can hurt.<p>

<H2> Grand Huntsman Darral and Royal Scribe Kaavin Slain!!!</H2>

Yesterday a delegation of the Darkflame Knights enter Icewell Keep on orders from King Tormax personally to hunt down to loyal followers of Dain. With skill and determination we lured first the Huntsman to the tunnels before the city and assassinated him without much challenge.<p>

The Royal Scribe was clearly smarted or more coward and refused to leave the castle. So with magic from our shamans we sneaked into his glass floored room and engaged the Scribe. The battle lasted significantly longer than the huntsman but eventually we also put him in the grave he deserved so long. <p>

Congratulations to Makebleed and Gobbin to the treasures we wrung out of the hand of these arch enemies of our King Tormax.<p>

Boots of the Huntsman: AC: 15 +5 WIS, +5 INT, +5 CR Chain classes (Makebleed)<BR>
Book of the Binder:(not sure about its name) WIS+5 INT+5 mana+30  primary/secondary (Gobbin)<BR>
Royal Frosted Velium Boots: AC19 sv magic+5 (Papaa)<p>

Sadly both friends of Dain's court lost the heads before we slayed them. But there will be a next time. <p>

<H2> Gather around the fire, grab a mug of ale and listen...</H2>
Hearken to me all ye Lords and Ladies<BR>
Listen all with spirit and heart<BR>
I tell ye the tales of the bold and the brave<BR>
Of heroes and legends of no small part<p>

They stride through Norrath’s darkest lairs <BR>
Battle on with courage in evil’s abode <BR>
Always with honor and courage they strive <BR>
Ne’r to disgrace the might that they hold <p>

With dignity Death is tested forthwith <BR>
For a challenge met is a challenge won <BR>
Conquest gained gives no undue conceit <BR>
For valor’s consequence be life undone <P>

Wealth beyond measure is friendship’s grasp <BR>
In a guild that pays homage to hearts and minds <BR>
Our Masters, their honor we must do preserve <BR>
To safeguard our own is a promise not light <P>

Stand proud my friends, let not arrogance show<BR>
Defeat our foes with poise and grace <BR>
Let justice serve a magnanimous hand <BR>
For we have all known true majesty’s faith<P>

Honor, respect and considerate ways <BR>
Are what is needed to embrace this fight <BR>
If thus the challenge you choose to meet <BR>
You may just be a Darkflame Knight <P>

------------------------------------------------------------------<p>

A wonderful poem by our own druid lady Meenie Rainseeker that<BR>
 speaks so true from the hearts of the Darkflame Knights.<BR>

<H2>This Weekend - Jan 26-28th, 2001</H2>

We have an eventful weekend ahead of us:<p>

Friday starts off with helping Dravin with the cleric FA. The target is the plasmatic priest in the temple of solosek ro. The raid party should consist of 2 40-50 groups and the event should not take longer than 1 hour. Gathering is at 8pm EST in lavastorm.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.darkflame.org/forum.cgi?parent=980361180&topparent=980361180#CONTENTS"> The Forum Thread for the Cleric FA</A><p>

Saturday will be the Plane of Hate Raid for the 45+. Matteo will be leading the forces up at 6pm est. Gathering should be at lavastorm druid ring also. <p>
Falaniel hurry to get 45 and Dravin, try to get 49! The stones for the hate raid will be around 150pp per group so everyone should contribute around 50pp for two ports up. Not that I expect a wipeout. =p<p>

<A HREF="http://www.drawmjil.fakta.se/oc/guides/ipren2.htm">A very good Plane of Hate Guide</A> <p>

Finally Sunday we have a befallen raid scheduled at 2pm EST. I will bring Tymbor, the powerful lvl 16 chanter that promises not to fizzle too much. I actually have spend some time practizing spell skills. Lilita, the couragous paladin lady, will be leading the main group down. Anyone that has spare keys in the bank, please give me a tell so we don't have to camp the shadowknights for them at all cost. The raid should be mostly for the lvl 10-25 and starts at 2pm est. Mistletoe, the Magi room soloer, will be making pickups from all old world .<p>

Salut good Flames,
