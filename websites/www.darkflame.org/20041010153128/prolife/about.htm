            <p>This is a pro-life clique. The objective of this clique is to put 
              together all people who are, in some aspect, anti-abortion. This 
              clique wasn't made to discuss what's right and what's wrong, it 
              was made only to put together people who think alike.</p>
            <p>You can join if you are totally against abortion, and you can join 
              too if you are partly against abortion. The important thing is, 
              you must be against abortion in some way. I am open to this because 
              I think it's a big improvement if people think abortion in wrong, 
              even partly. It's a beggining.</p>
            <p>Babies do feel pain in a few time after conception, and don't matter 
              how structured clinics can be, the way they're killed is barbaric. 
              They aren't just killed, without pain, what I'd consider to be a 
              better death if it had to be done. They suffer all the pain while 
              they have parts of their little bodies taken away.</p>
            <p>I am completely pro-life since the day i watched a video tape in 
              school with images of aborted babies. I got shocked. It seems they 
              have been ground and then thrown in the garbage. First, they have 
              their heads pulled out. Then, the rest comes out looking like a 
              mix of blood and flesh. They don't look like humans anymore. And 
              they have been humans once.</p>
            <p>And the fact that those babies can't speak, scream, and can't even 
              be seen by their mothers, doesn't mean this action is not called 
              murder. Something - someone - was alive and was killed by someone 
              else's hands without any chance to protect himself. If this is not 
              murder, i don't know what it is.</p>
            <p>Look at a smiling baby sometime and consider that he/she could 
              not have been given a chance to be there smiling. And it would not 
              be his fault. Can't the parents raise the children? Many others 
              can. Don't you want to lose your freedom because you are too young 
              to have a child? Don't punish the child for the fact that <em>you</em> 
              have had sex without any maturity.</p>
            <p>Rape cases: people always ask me if I think it's right keeping 
              a baby that will remind you of the rape for the rest of your life. 
              I think that aborting the baby won't make you forget you were raped. 
              Plus, don't forget that the baby is half you too. People shouldn't 
              hate innocent babies because of something that someone else has 
              done.</p>
            <p><a href="mailto:luvagirl2@aol.com">Erin</a> sent this e-mail with 
              more information she got:</p>
            <p>&quot;They would inject something into the baby... and the baby 
              could actually feel it!! Or they would pierce their skull with scissors... 
              she even said that they would tell the pregnant woman that there 
              was a 2 day procedure, and they would speed up the pregnancy, and 
              the woman would go into labor that night... and actually have the 
              baby in the hotel (when the pregnant woman thought she was getting 
              an abortion) [or something]... and she would go ahead and have the 
              baby (pre-maturely) and they would put the baby's body in a bucket, 
              and take it back to the abortion clinic and freeze the body (the 
              baby was alive too)... also she said that one time the woman who 
              wanted an abortion actually had the baby (twins)... and the doctor 
              wanted nothing to do with them... and neither did the assistant 
              or anyone else, so they put them in a pan, and filled it up with 
              water and drowned them!! It really made me think, it's really sad. 
              I actually cried during class because of it. It also made me think, 
              at 15... if I ever got pregnant before I was married, I would go 
              ahead and have the baby... I don't know if this is the only way 
              to get an abortion, but the ways I have heard are barbaric...&quot;</p>
            <p><a href="mailto:rock4life360@yahoo.com">Sara</a> also sent this 
              to me:</p>
            <p>&quot;I just wanted to tell you of a law that just passed, if you 
              didn't know. There is a new law that says if an aborted baby is 
              still alive he/she must be taken to a hospital. Also, I wanted to 
              tell you of a book you might want to read and recommend on your 
              site. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1561794155/qid=1029518570/sr=8-5/ref=sr_8_5/104-9126679-2788720?s=books&n=507846" target="new">Gianna: 
              Aborted...and Lived to Tell About It</a> by Jessica Shaver. True 
              story about a girl whose mother had a saline abortion and survived 
              and is still alive. A saline abortion is when a saline solution 
              (salt-poison) is injected into the bag of water around the baby. 
              It slowly burns the baby and hours or days later the mother delivers 
              a dead baby.</p>
            <p>And having just read what you have said about rape victims, less 
              than 1% of mothers have abortions because of rape. Maybe 2 to 4% 
              have them because of incest. 95% and over is for mere convenience. 
              And here is another frightening statistic: Over 3000 (closer to 
              4000) babies are aborted every day. One third of the teens, children, 
              and young adults that would have been born and become friends and 
              classmates after 1973 are not here.</p>
            <p>Sorry if I sound like I'm preaching, but I just want to get as 
              much information to as many people as I can. I hate abortion and 
              I'm thankful as all heck that my teen mother gave me up for adoption. 
              ~_- I'm positive that if the *babies* were given a choice they would 
              all choose life!&quot;</p>
