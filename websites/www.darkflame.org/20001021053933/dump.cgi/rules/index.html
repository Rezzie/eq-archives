<H2>Officers</H2>
All officers come up for re-election every 6 months and may be re-proposed if
necessary. Dates for re-election are 1st June and 1st December each year.
While there are certain people that will be fullfilling the following positions, all officers are part of a council and the number of officers will vary based on the needs of the guild.

The officer positions are:
<H3>Guildmaster</H3>
To hold together the guild in trust for its membership.
<H3>Internal officer: Second In Command</H3>
To assist the GM and to help with the smooth operation of the Guild
<H3>Alliance Liason</H3>
Responsible for maintaining relationships with other guilds.  Aids in coordinating multi-guild gatherings and events.
<H3>Technical Officer</H3>
Responsible for adding/maintaining features of the website.
<H3>Web Officer</H3>
Responsible for the content of the website (ie. Guild News, Screenshots, Links, etc...)
<P>
Any officer may at any time retire from their post, at which point,
the next meeting of the guild will hold an election for replacement of that 
officer for the remainder of that officers 6 month term.

<H2>Guild Disbanding</H2>
Just because the GM has the ability to disband the guild he/she may never do
so. The Guild is held in trust by that person for the benefit of the members,
not for the benefit of the GM. A 75% vote of all member is required before
the guild may be disbanded.

<H2>Joining the guild</H2>
The procedures for becoming a member are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>We require that potential members be at least the 10th
level, so a distinctive personality and playing experience has been
developed. 
<LI>The applicant hits 'Join', and fills out the name and email. This will
email a password, which the applicant can use to login. Then the applicant
will hit modify and fill in all the data. Once done, the applicant will be
an official Applicant.
<LI>At this point, it is the responsibility of ALL members to try to group
with the applicant, and the applicant should likewise try to group with
members. It is helpfull for you to contact our membership officers in order to arrange a group or a meeting.  If a member feels that the applicant has what it takes to become a
Darkflame, he/she can 'sponsor' the applicant by selecting the applicant
from the member list and hit the big 'sponsor' button. This will make the
applicant an apprentice.<BR>
<B>It is a big help in this step if the applicant actively contacts darkflame members and talks to them.</B>
<LI>Once an apprentice, the apprentice will be considered for full
membership on each officer meeting, until by majority vote the apprentice is
either accepted or rejected. If neither outcome has majority, the vote will
be postponed to the next meeting.
</UL>

<H2>Twinks and Cheaters</H2>
Twinking, when blatantly advertised to the point that it brings the guild
name in shame, is expressively utterly forbidden.<BR>
In addition, cheating or repeated attempts at it, is forbidden.

<H2>General Behaviour</H2>
We are a good guild. We are a strong guild. We are built on justice, wisdom,
insight, compassion, patience, charity and close to any other good goal you
know of. Act like it. It isn't enough to have the guild title, you have to
BE a darkflame knight. Help those in need, and be 'nice'. And if you can't
be Mother Theresa, at least make sure you aren't vicious and evil, no matter
HOW provoked you are.<BR>
Breaches of this basic etiquette will mean instant dismissal from the guild.
