<H2>Encounters with Lucan</H2>
<P>
As I look out from the platform that I call home in Kelethin I noticed the guards down by the lifts.  I start to think to myself about the many times they have saved me from the orcs that infest my homeland. I can remember when I was a little ranger in training and having to run to them with 3 orcs chasing me.  They would always pull their swords and cut the orcs down fast and take out some time to show me a few tricks to help me the next time.  They did this because we are an honorable people and they too would like to see the end of the monstrosity of Crushbone.
<P>
As I grew older I participated in the removal of many orcs from my lands, but for every one I killed they would be five more brought in from some foreign lands.  I decided one day that I shall seek out this land that they come from and try and destroy them right there.  I got up one day and packed my backpack.  Said my goodbyes and started my journey not knowing where it might lead me too.
<P>
I traveled to the dwarf city and looked at there short stout guards.   They are just like the guards in Kelethin, watching over the people in the lands and letting weary travelers know about bandits.  I stopped and asked directions to the boat docks and was told to follow the path. So I continued down that path.  When I reached the dock the boat was already there so I hopped aboard wondering where the boat was taking me too.  What lands, peoples, and such would I find?
<P>
I reached a town, actually a huge city, called Freeport.  I jumped off the boat and at once my senses were going crazy with the many different sounds, smells, and sights.  This city is so different from my home. There were no big beautiful trees, sweet smells from the forest or even the clean platforms that us Wood Elves are so used too.  Instead I was standing in a city that was built upon a desert, dusty and hot. I wonder around Freeport looking at what the vendors were selling and just in general getting to know what humans were like. I came across a vendor who was selling food and to my shock I found him selling some Bear meat as FOOD! The city was very bright with all its lights and the people were running around like mad man from one vendor to another.  Some little gnome was selling hair tonics and other vendors were selling all kinds of different stuff.  It took me a while to adjust my vision to the lights, for in Kelethin we do not have such bright lights all over, jus!
t a few dim ones.  I had not realized that Humans eyesight was so poor.
<P>
Later that eve I walked into an alley where the lights were not as bright to rest my poor eyes.  When suddenly a tall human jumped up from behind me and pulled a dagger from his pocket.  He told me if I gave him all my money he would let me live.  I immediately stepped deeper into the shadows so that he could no longer see me and shout to the guard that was patrolling not more that 10 feet away.  The guard walked over and shined his light upon the thief then upon me.  He looked at us a moment and asked if there was anything wrong here.  I explained what had happen and I was shocked at his reply.  He told me that Elves are low life scum that would have to fend for themselves. He suggested that I give him my money and then to go back to my "dirty" Trees.  He then walked away leaving my attacker to deal with "our" situation.  My attacker turned around to me and restated that I should give him my money.  Stupid human I thought, as the light was fading away.  When the alley returned to the darkness of the night, I slowly pulled my sword from my side.  I began taunting my attacker, for he could no longer see me, he was swinging his dagger wildly looking for me.  I thought well if the guard is not going to do anything about it then I should have to take matters into my own hands.  What was this fool thinking?  Does he truly think that us elves are weak, pitiful beings?  If he did then that will be the last thought he ever had.  In one swift graceful motion I lopped off his head with my sword.  I watch his body crumble to the ground and then I cleaned the tiny bit of blood from my sword and replaced it back into its sheath. I then stepped out into the street and started to make my way towards the Inn when shouting started to alarm the guards.  Unfortunately a woman had stumble upon the dead thief's body and started to scream. I started to walk a bit faster towards the Inn when the guard I first called ran up to me and stated that I was under arrest.  "Under Arrest? For what may I ask?" I said.
<P>
"For the murder of a citizen of Freeport!" he shouted at me.
"But sir did I not call upon you for help? Did I not try to do the right thing?  You left me there in the alley with a murderous thief! What did you expect me to do sir?" I responded.
"You should have given him the money, you elves do not deserved to even breath our air without paying for it!"
"Sir why do you dislike me so?  I have done nothing to you, but yet you treat me like a common criminal. No matter, I will continue about my ways.  Good night Sir."
<P>
"Did you not hear what I said?  You are under arrest! You will go with me now to see Sir Lucan.  He will know what to do with the likes of you." He spitted the words out at me.
I could see his total hatred of elves and thought well maybe Lucan will be different.
<P>
"Ok lead on good sir I shall follow."
"Surrender you sword."
<P>
"I said I will go with you, I will not surrender my sword to you.  Let us go and see Lucan or get this over with here and now.  Mind you sir I am not a weak child who cannot defend themselves.  If I must I will kill you, but I prefer to deal with this matter peacefully."
"Ok follow me" he replied.
<P>
We walked towards a red brick building when we ran across Lucan in the streets.  The guard explained the situation to Lucan, leaving out a lot of pertinent details and just about spitting his disgust of elves all over Lucan's uniform.  When he finished I began to speak when Lucan cut me off.
"Take this "elf" to the nearest tree and hang him." Lucan commanded. And he walked off.
<P>
The guard grabbed me by my arm and jerk on it hauling me off towards some gate and inevitably a Tree.  I was in shock by this whole situation and the treatment I was receiving from these guards. Never in my whole life have I ever been accused of any type of crime, nor have I have seen guards that were so so so dishonorable.  I had to act fast; I jerked my arm away from the prey.  Now that is what I was now considering the guard, my prey. I pulled out my sword and met his sword half way in the air.  He swung his heavy blade down towards my shoulder but I just sidestepped out of the way.  I sent my elbow crashing into his back as I brought my knee up into his stomach.  He dropped to his knees and gasped for help.  I could have killed him right then and there, but decided that I needed to run for others were on their way.  I ran around a few corners and bounce right into a guard.  I jumped back and ready my sword.  The guard just looked at me.
<P>
"What seems to be the trouble here? Why are you running with your sword drawn? " He asked.
<P>
At that moment the other guards had just rounded the corner and stopped.  The new guard pulled his sword and push me behind him like a mother would do with her child as danger was approaching them.  I stood there and watch the confrontation. I found out that the new guard was a paladin whose duties included protecting people from the guards of the Militia.  He told them he would kill every one of them if they did not return to their part of the city and they complied with his orders.  We talked a bit when another Paladin approached us and relieved my new friend from his duties.  He invited me to the local inn for a few drinks and I accepted.  I told him of what had happened in the alley and to my surprise he told me that I had killed a Militia guard.  He further stated that I was now a wanted elf and I would no longer be able to travel thought the East and West parts of the city freely.  I was confused.  Why would guards, whom I have always seen as honorable, act such as these!
 did? He explained about the fallen paladin Lucan and the evils that run through the Freeport Militia.  He told me they are not to be trusted in any matter, for they were not honorable and that did not like anyone that even came close to associating themselves with Paladins.  "Hell I know of many Paladins in Greater Faydark.  We grew up together," I said.
<P>
"And that is the problem.  They dislike you because of your friends.  Lucan is an evil man and he holds great anger and hatred towards honorable Paladins.  And because of your connection with the paladins of your homeland you are considered as an enemy. The only way that they evil will ever be flushed out of Freeport is for someone to get together some friends and slay Lucan.  Oh just a second, there is this one Paladin.  Hmm let me think what is his name?  Oh yea Sodor is recruiting just for this purpose."
<P>
"I know Sodor he is a brother of mine.  I shall send word to him that I will help in the slaying or Lucan. Sorry my friend, but I must be off now to find Sodor.  Thank you for your helping and my Tunare watch over you."
I then got up and went to my room. I sat down at the table next to the bed and drafted my letter to Sodor;
<P>
To my Brother Sodor,
I have come across some information that you are looking for fellow brothers and sisters to help you in your quest of dispatching the evil Lucan.  I am offering my services to you as a ranger in this quest and shall do what ever you require of me to help complete your quest.  Please send word to me of the time and date and I shall meet you outside of the city of Freeport by the stonewall. Just for your information I am not able to travel freely in the city so you will have to devise a plan on bringing Lucan out of the city. Please let me know of your intentions.<P>
Your fellow brother of the Darkflame,<BR>
