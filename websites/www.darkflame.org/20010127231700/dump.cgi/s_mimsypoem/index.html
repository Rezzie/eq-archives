<H2>The Epic Tale of the Darkflame Knights</H2>
<H5>By Mimsy</H5>
Toxxulia Forest - far o'er the sea,<BR>
Wherein lie the skeletons cackling with glee,<BR>
Is a place I once wandered with lute in my hand<BR>
peering out through the dark as I travelled the land.<BR>
<BR>
The kobolds did scatter - at my sight they did flee,<BR>
Leaping high, as they do, to the tops of the trees.<BR>
I stood brave. I stood tall. I sang with strong might,<BR>
of the deeds of the Darkflames - a famed group of Knights.<BR>
<BR>
I sang loudly of Trog, emperor on most high,<BR>
who for being a troll, is one sweet, big, green guy.<BR>
Of Aearen I sang, Ranger... Hugger of Trees,<BR>
And his brave battle cry, &quot;Trog, buff me up, please?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I sang praises to Biggis, short rogue - half a pint,<BR>
and told tales of his battles in Freeport one night.<BR>
Othar's song did huk huk, for the cleric so furry<BR>
Whose brave, fuzzy toes never care, never worry.<BR>
<BR>
Of Davaren I sang, of his sleek perfect hair,<BR>
and his helmet for opening ales without care.<BR>
Genasi, lady fair, who never seems tire,<BR>
lugging 'Flames back and forth from each druid spire.<BR>
<BR>
I ran through the forest, singing loudly and plain,<BR>
Of Jolith the brave, and his new Ghoulbane.<BR>
Menelaos the sage, who I oft want to tickle,<BR>
to see if he might crack a smile - perhaps giggle.<BR>
<BR>
I told of Strumm, DarkFlames' highest of bards,<BR>
My lute rang out true as I strummed out more chords.<BR>
Aaeldevenya the dark, in her robe blue and pale,<BR>
with her tongue twister name she just answers to Aael.<BR>
<BR>
Of Nujai the fair, and the long lost Beldrew,<BR>
who in Oasis one night, greatly speeded my youth.<BR>
I sang loudly of Beltaine, our leader most recent,<BR>
and his deeds as a wolf, always honored and decent.<BR>
<BR>
I ran o'er a bridge- sang of Aegeis and Soulfire,<BR>
some sword caught aflame - a monster's funeral pyre.<BR>
Of Ceasar dressed in steel, all shiny and bright,<BR>
A walking lightstone in the mid' of the night.<BR>
<BR>
I sang tales of the Darkflames, of young and of old,<BR>
Trivian, Faludir, Darin, Cal' and Quatto,<BR>
of others whose names are known through the land,<BR>
as the bravesest of Knights, as a great merry band.<BR>
<BR>
As I rounded the island and my song did well end,<BR>
with suprise I did see this collection of friends,<BR>
Standing proud, true, and tall near the gates and the guards,<BR>
with merely a chuckle for the foibles of bards.<BR>
<BR>
With swords at the ready, they did make quite a sight,<BR>
As I slipped in the ranks and we made off tot he night.<BR>
Kobolds did scamper, skeletons fled in fright,<BR>
At the sight of the famous and great Darkflame Knights.
