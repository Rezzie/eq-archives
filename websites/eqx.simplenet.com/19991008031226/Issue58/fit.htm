NERIAK FOREIGN QUARTER - Those who drank at the fountain near Silk
Underground today found to their horror that their skin turned black.
Scrawled above the fountain in ultralight letters readable only by the
Tier'dal was the phrase: "Those who live in Neriak must be dark skinned".
It is suspected that the infamous group F'leurs DuMal were responsible.
The fountain, known as the Pool of Pernicia, was created in honor of the
first non-human in Neriak.

NEKTULOS - The Recent resurgence of Dark Elven pride has reached new
heights this week, as bands of Dark Elves roam Nektulos on self-styled
"purges". No longer confined to the streets of Neriak's Foreign Quarter,
racial hatred has spilled out into the surrounding area, and tensions are
running high. Hardest hit are the Halflings, who until now have had a
fairly large interest in the forest. Yesterday the flayed bodies of 12
Halfling women and children were found nailed to trees.
<br><br>
Rivervale is apparently looking into the situation, and has not made an
official decision, yet a spokesperson had this to say "We have a vested
interest in the Nektulos Forest. I assure you. We will protect our
interests." 
<br><br>
T'daven H'yonith, Leader of the F'leurs DuMal, a movement dedicated to the purging of
Neriak of non-Dark Elves, had this comment.  "I didn't know the lesser
animals could speak.  Can they do tricks too?"

QEYNOS - The silence has lifted at last.  After a period of total and
consuming quiet, the sounds of footfalls, roaring drakes, thunderstorms, and
the like have become audible again.
 <br><br>
It is believed that the periodic silence was the result of a plot by
Innoruuk, the duke of pain, to drive all creatures mad through deprivation of
the senses.
 <br><br>
"Had his plan worked," stated a source within the Mages guild of Qeynos, "we
surmise that all things would have been struck blind next."
 <br><br>
When asked to what we owe this reprieve, the source stated "Who knows.  One
of the other gods might have foiled Innoruuk, or perhaps he has just given us
a taste of his power and now he'll fall back and let people agonize a while
before he continues."
