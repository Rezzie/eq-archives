I grow tired of your attempts to take this job away from me.  You haven't the strength nor wit to prevent me from doing as I choose.  I can only attribute your dislike of my work solely to your very small minds.  I shall continue to provide your vapid audience with some of the teachings of Hate.  Perhaps, by some miracle of Innoruuk, they shall learn something.

<em>Dear Auntie Moog (or wun of dem udder writers)!
<br><br>
Dis troll wuz wundrin.. why can I no wurship da Tribunal?  I pray to dem, I no bash gud peoples.. an' I bash bad peoples alla time.  I is a gud troll, but da big hyoomies' shaman god will no lissen to me!  Can you tink ov anytin?  My hed hurts frum writin.

Well, my first thought...  No, let's skip the first thought.  My second thought is that the Tribunal is a fool's god.  In fact, there is a fairly good chance that there never was such a god.  The history of those smelly beasts (the Barbarians, not you stupid Trolls) is sketchy at best.  Read the texts and you will find that there is no record of this Tribunal, nor its actions, that was not written by a Barbarian.  Simply put, there is no Tribunal.  My guess is that the Barbarian shamans draw their power from Bristlebane.  That would be just the kind of trick that he would pull.
<br><br>
And your head hurts not because you are writing, but simply because you are a Troll.

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,

Don't let her disappearance bother you.  If she is lucky, she has found the path of Hate and is at this very moment seeking you out so that she can atone for her sins by barshing you in the head repeatedly.

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I have been cursed with lycanthropy.  This means that I find myself, on the fullest of moons, changing into a terrible beast.  I don't remember the destruction that I may have caused, and I'm not sure that I want to.  I now live alone, surviving as I can out in the deepest dessert.
<br><br>
Can you, please, tell me if there is a cure?  If there is not then I will shortly be forced to end my own life.  I can't have murder on my conscience and continue to live.
<br><br>

Well, that's an interesting dilemma.  Let me grant you one of the parables of the Church.
<br><br>
There once was a Teir'dal warrior.  He was full of Hate, and his people were justly proud of his accomplishments.  One day he met a woman.  This woman just happened to be a great dire wolf.  The dire wolf, according to legend, is the chosen beast of our Father.  It's ferocity and Hatred is admirable for a beast that can only Hate out of instinct (for true Hate requires an understanding of what it is to Hate).  The wolf and the warrior faced off.  The warrior paced to his left as the wolf paced to her right.  They both decided to strike at the same moment.  She leapt as he rushed forward.  Neither of them thinking to defend themselves from the other, for they were both ruled by Hate, and their own lives meant nothing to them.
<br><br>
Some Voices will tell you that they fought for hours, and that the battle was noble and that they both fought bravely.  Those Voices lie.  For if they fought in a noble fashion then they could never have been granted their boon.  For they both Hated with such passion that they killed each other in moments.
<br><br>
Innoruuk was in the forest that day, for those were the days when such things happened.  He saw the battle, and knew their Hate.  At that moment he knew what he must do.  From their spirits he formed a new creature.  He gave them the power to infect others with the strength of their Hate.  Be grateful for the gift you have been given.  You are now one of the favored children of Hate.  Come to Neriak and I shall teach you what you need to know to reach your full potential.
