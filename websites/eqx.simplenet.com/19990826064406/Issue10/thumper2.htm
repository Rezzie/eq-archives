	<big><big>M</big></big>any anit-pkillers say that we don’t role-play, allow me to give you an example of how we role-play.  Babamonkey, fellow IC member, was friends with Milamber, leader of "The Band".  Well, TB didn’t like IC, except for Milamber.  One day me, Baba, and Mox (another IC) ran into Milamber and a few other TB guys outside of their guild HQ.  As was standard operating procedure me and Mox jumped in, killing two before Baba was able to get us to stop.  Me and Mox apologized to Milamber for attacking him and his little 5 man group because we didn’t know that he was friends with Baba, then resurrected his fallen guildmates.  Evidentially the TB guys got in IRC and called in more reinforcements because within just a few minutes we were surrounded by what seemed to be their entire guild.  Milamber was being cool, he understood it was just a misunderstanding and nobody was any worse off, but the other guys really wanted to kill us.  We called for reinforcements so 2 other IC guys show up.  Now we are only outnumbered 15 to 5.  Once we had 5 IC guys there TB was giving us a little more space, but we could all tell they were itching to jump us, but they knew that without Milambers help they would be slaughtered.  We stood our ground, we didn’t attempt to flee, honestly I believe we could have taken them all, Milamber would have been the only one that was a threat, but Baba assured us that he would take no action against us.  Without Milambers help they wouldn’t attack.  A couple of them would talk trash occasionally, but Milamber was quick to put them in line.  About that time the server crashed.  But as you can see from this one little example, we did more than just kill, its just that only a select few ever lived long enough to see us long to see us role-play.

Most say we don’t role-play because all we do is kill.  Unless you were one of the strongest players in the game, we’d rather kill you than give you the time of day.  We are ruthless, we are the thing in the shadows that you fear, we are the evil scourge that plagues the land.  If we have nothing to gain from you, other than your goods, we’d just kill you and take them.  And honestly there were only a very few that were worth talking to.  We learned from Rainman and ERASER not to even waist time talking to people because they would put up a front of being pro-IC when the whole time they were just scheming to kill us.  We grew not to trust anyone, and because of this mistrust we talked to outsiders very seldomly, and because of this it is said that we do not role-play.
<br><br>
And what exactly is role-playing?  Evidentially it is not character development or guild interaction or accumulation of goods nor is it building a reputation.  I say that because I am constitanly accused of not role-playing, yet that is what I do.

The other big thing I am accused of on a regular basis is bug exploitation.  Well folks, I hate to break it to you, but everyone used these same exploitations against us.  Should it be fair that "good" players get to use the exploits but not us "evil" types?  I think not.  But yet you never see anybody complaining about "good" people using these exploits to kill "evil" people.  Why is that?  Oh yes, I know, its because us evil types know that death is a part of this game we play.  The game we play is the same game you "good" types play, look at the box our game came in, then look at the box your game came in, yes, they are exactly the same.  If you don’t like the way we play, do something in-game about it, don’t complain to the programmers to change the rules of the game.
<br><br>
It all boils down to this: Pkillers are the type of players that thrive on player vs. player competition.  Not everybody likes that type of game, but since pkilling is allowed within the game you should learn to live with it, or don’t play the game.  If you don’t like the role we choose to play, then role-play a bounty hunter and come kill us.  Don’t complain and whine about us not role-playing, role-play yourself.
