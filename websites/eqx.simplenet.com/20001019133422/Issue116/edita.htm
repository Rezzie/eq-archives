Recently Brad took up a challenge given to him by some of the posters on the official EverQuest web site boards.  The thread is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/020104.html">here</a>.  It's a long one, so take frequent rests along the way.  Me, I skipped most of the content and went right to what Brad wrote.  I'll admit to being very jaded and I didn't really expect much from what the average poster on that board had to say, and I wanted to see if there was anything of interest from the man himself.  And there was.  A lot of what I read struck notes in me, some of them matching tones that have been humming about in me for a long time.
<br><br>
I want to talk about parts of Brads posts in that thread, so please read what he wrote in full before responding to me about it.  I'll do my very best to keep my quotes logical and in context as much as I can.  I have no intention of misrepresenting anyone.
<br><br>
<em>Like I said, I'm sure we are alienating some players with our decisions. It's inevitable. You can't please everyone all the time. But one of our biggest problems right now is overcrowding, which is the result of waaaay more people playing EQ than we ever thought would play, especially almost a year after its launch. Were our policies and decisions negatively affecting even a small but significant portion of our player base, overcrowding would not be an issue.</em>
<br><br>
And is essence I agree with your comment.  Your decisions are not alienating players as much as the vocal minority would have you think.  Though later I have a point to make about the logic behind some of those decisions and how I think the vision you had for the game has been sidetracked, right now I just have a comment about overcrowding.  No, people are not leaving in droves, overcrowding shows that to be true.  My question is, then, when are you going to finally accept that and add a ton more servers.
<br><br>
I get the feeling that Verant is holding back adding servers because there could be an even bigger problem with undercrowding if people DO start to leave in droves.  It's probably as much trouble to combine servers as it is to split them, with all of the same logistical problems and any real or imagined potential server economic problems.  Add to that the expense and trouble of putting up the extra servers that you need during the boom and the heartbreak of taking them back down during the potential slump, and I can understand why you may have been holding back.  I am starting to believe, however, that this may be a self-fulfilling fear.  You may be holding back adding servers for fear of a future slump in customers, and doing so may cause the very slump that you fear.  It's a tough dilemma.  Me, I say go for it, add ten new servers.  If you have to take them down, save them for Sovereign or the Star Wars game.
<br><br>
And don't expect the expansion to help crowding.  The problem there is that for every server that sees a 33% increase in playable areas, that same server will see an increase in population of 33% due to new sales and old players returning.
<br><br>

We have asked simple questions and been told.. in effect "You don't Need to Know.." 
This is not acceptable behavior for a customer support group. at least give us something to go on here. Please?
<br><br> 
Brad responded:<br>
I must disagree. There are many questions that we should not answer, just like when playing AD&D there are many questions and details the DM will not reveal.</em>
<br><br>
I completely agree with this idea.  This is, I think, one of the core differences between what role-players want out of a game and what powergamers want out of a game.  For me, I don't need to know all of the statistics of a monster, spell, skill or whatever.  Knowing too much can seriously ruin a game.  The best way that I can explain this is by example.  This is a real example, by the way.  In one of our pen and paper D&D games, many years ago, we encountered a demi-lich.  This thing is basically the skull of a lich that has decided to spend his time on other planes.  The skull is his anchor to his plane of origin.  These things are nearly indestructible.  The best thing to do with a demi-lich is to sneak away and hope that it doesn't notice you.  Well one of our group was a powergamer.  He spent a lot of his spare time reading the Monster Manual and any game module that he could get his hands on.  Let's call him Mr. L.  When we make a lucky guess about the design of a game, like making all the right turns in a maze, we jokingly say that we checked Mr. L's web sight before the game and we've downloaded the whole adventure.  At this point it is traditional for the GM to toss his hands in the air and award all of the treasure and experience points to the players and then see what's on TV.  Anyhow...  when we encountered this demi-lich, Mr. L. immediately went to the Astral Plane and cast a Slay Living spell on it (well, it may not have been Slay Living, but it was some obscure spell like that).  It seems that in the official description of the demi-lich it says that going to the Astral Plane and casting that obscure spell on it will kill it.  Mr. L. was shocked when the Evil GM just smiled and said 'that's nice' and went on with the game.  Mr. L. was hard-pressed not to scream out 'but the book SAYS that it should be DEAD now!'
<br><br>
Look, folks, the player does NOT need to know everything in the game.  They don't need all the mechanics.  They don't need all the statistics.  In fact, knowing all that takes away from the game.  One of the main reasons that computer role-playing games appeal to me is that I can play in a world where the rules are somewhat unknown to me.  This allows for shock, surprise, adventure and discovery.  Take that away and I think you'll find role-playing just as exciting as watching re-runs of those old D&D cartoons.
<br><br>
<em>I say this because when I was burned out after playing a MUD I used to play a lot (over 2 years, 50+ days invested) I don't know if I would have acknowledged the problem, at least not initially (I did figure it out over time, after thinking about the phenomenon a lot, and wondering and planning how EQ would deal with it).</em>
<br><br>
There was a lot more to this than what I cut out above.  Brad wrote a very interesting post about how burnout affects us in these games.  But what caught me here was this little bit about being burned out and not being aware of it.  I may have been burned out for a while.  It's a very hard thing to realize, and even harder to accept.  Especially once you have such a large investment in the game.  I've been involved in EverQuest for over two years if you include the time that I spent wondering about the game before beta.  There isn't a computer game that I've played for longer than a few months.  I now believe that I am burned out.  There is no shame in that, not for me, nor for Verant.  As Brad so eloquently put it:
<br><br>
<em>People get burnt out of just about anything in life. Some things take longer to grow weary of, but eventually just about everything grows old. As another poster wrote, and I paraphrase, 'no game has infinite playability.'</em>
<br><br>
I'm not ending my subscription.  I'm not angry with Verant for anything that they've done.  I'm not burned out because MY CLASS GOT NERFED! or MY ITEM GOT NERFED!  I'm just done with it for a while.  I'll probably play on occasion.  My friends will probably entice me into the game now and again.  And I'll certainly look into Kunark.  I'm not done with EverQuest, but at least I'm now aware that I've burned out.
<br><br>
Brad goes on to describe some assertions about the MMORPG burnout phenomenon:
<br><br>
<em>2. Patching. MMORPGs can and are patched. They evolve and change.</em>
<br><br>
I agree with this, in theory.  I certainly accept that this is the goal of such games.  But I'm not at all certain that EverQuest has achieved this.  This is where I think that perhaps the vision has been lost.
<br><br>
Is EverQuest patched?  Well sure.  Is EverQuest changed?  Sure.  Is EverQuest evolving?  Well, no.  This is where I think that they've lost their focus.  In beta the emphasis was on what cool features and new spells and skills could make it in the game before release.  It was all about the wonder of making and the not so wonderful duty of making it all balance.  But since release the focus has turned to calming the screaming minions of players, and the not so wonderful duty of making it all balance.  Balance has become so much of the focus of Verant and the players that it has overwhelmed any chance that we could actually see evolution in the game.  Changing how pets dual wield is not an evolution, it's just a change.  Adding in new quests could be evolution, if done properly.  If used to advance a plot line, convey information to the players, change the lives of a few characters, that's evolution of the game.  Just adding a quest so that a certain fiery blade can be found, while important, is not evolving the game.
<br><br>
Here is what I see.  I see Verant interpreting 'evolve' to mean 'changing the game mechanics to meet future needs or to change some aspects of game play.  Me, I see 'evolve' as 'changing the world that the characters live in, so that it seems more like a real world'.  I'm certainly not saying that evolving the game mechanics isn't important.  It certainly is.  But it really should be a secondary concern.  Evolving the world for the characters should be a primary concern.  I'm worried that changing mechanics, balancing classes, adding new spells, finding a way to keep the 50th level characters entertained, has taken priority over making an interesting game.  EverQuest is a static game.  It doesn't have to be.  While the tools do not exist that would make it feasible to change geography, there can be changes to the people of the world, the items in the world (yes, it's a GOOD thing if some item only exists in ONE instance in a world), and the attitudes of some people towards others.
<br><br>
And it's not just up to Verant to evolve the world.  Players can make the world more interactive for each other.  Rather than sitting in one place waiting for something to spawn, go out and interact with other character.  Set up an encounter for your fellow players.  Let your character change to react to what he sees and experiences.  Don't play the game just to get the next best item.  Play it to see what happens next.
<br><br>
Oddly enough, the question asked by the originator of the thread was, would you recommend EverQuest to your friends?
<br><br>
I would.  But like Brad points out in one of his long replies, not everyone will like it.  I know several people that would love it (if they had computers, I suggest that they buy EQ), and others that would not.  The trick is to know what you want, and what to expect from the game.  And Brad is right, before you we start complaining about the game, we should step back and realize what is up with ourselves first.  Don't get mad because you've gotten burned out on the game.  It's not your fault and it's not Verant's fault.  It just happens.  If you're done, move on.  If not, then you should still be enjoying the game enough to step back and think before ranting.  And play the game for fun, not for 'stuff'.
<br><br>
Sigh.
<br><br>
Hopefully my burnout will pass.  If not, I've had a great run.  And I'm staying in the community, regardless.
