CHAPTER 1
<br><br>
‘What kind of fool stands underneath a lamp in The Barrows?’  This thought raced
through my mind as I cautiously hugged the wall approaching this person.  I’ve worked
this section of the Thieves Quarter before, so I know some basic tenants of survival
here.  There can only be three answers for this person:
<br><br>
1. He has worked before.  Although it seems that he sees himself as being
invulnerable.  A trait that many killers has had proven wrong.
<br><br>
2. This man has no clue where he is, or the implications of his standing there.
This makes him ignorant, the poor bastard.  He has no idea how short his life
expectancy has become.
<br><br>
3. This man knows where he is.  He also does not care, or doesn’t see the
inhabitants of this area as a threat.  This thought chills my blood.

I stop my progress along the wall and crouch down.  I’m still not sure of this enigma
down the street.  He is not looking around like a country yokel.  He’s calmly waiting
for something, or someone.  
<br><br>
I study this man from my darkened area.  He is not overly tall, but very wide of
shoulder.  He pulled his cloak tightly around him with the hood in place, making it
difficult to perceive what he actually looked like.  The only feature I could
distinguish was his smile.  He had large canine teeth, but they were on the bottom
of his mouth.  They were more like tusks than actual teeth.  I ponder this as I
rise.

The street is empty, completely deserted.  This I take as an omen.  Before I
continue my approach to him, I faintly hear him speak to me.  "I have been waiting
for you.  Hurry, we haven’t much time."  Hearing this startles my slightly.  I
continue down the wall, not stalking anymore.  My booted feet make no sound as I
approach.  I stop just before losing my anonymity to the lamplight.  "You seem to
have me at a disadvantage friend, I know not who you are?" I reply.
