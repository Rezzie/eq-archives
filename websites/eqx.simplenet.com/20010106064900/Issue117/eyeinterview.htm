Sir Max's Quote: "Because so many readers have responded to me about the Nosy Evil Eye in Bard's Log #27, I decided to interview this previously unknown, now renown, character. 
<br><br>
SM: "Who are you?" 
<br><br>
Nosy Evil Eye: "I am an Evil Eye, but you can call me Fred." 
<br><br>
SM: "Are you evil?" 
<br><br>
Fred: "No, the 'Evil' in 'Evil Eye' is a misnomer. I'm not evil, just sarcastic, witty, and handsome. A more fitting name would be a 'Nosy Eye' or a 'Big Eyeball'." 
<br><br>
SM: "I see. You started as just a walk on character made to annoy and pester the hero. How did you become so famous?" 
<br><br>
Fred: "My boyish charm and good looks?" 
<br><br>
SM: "You don't seem quite sure..." 
<br><br>
Fred: "Well I don't know why I'm so famous all of a sudden. I go in there, say a few lines, and now I'm being stalked by Bixies!" 
<br><br>
SM: "I feel your pain. It was whiny paladins for me. Anyway, on to my next question: What do you think of Kyodai?" 
<br><br>
Fred: "The bard? He's a lousy writer, has no class, and it was great working with him" 
<br><br>
SM: "Huh?" 
<br><br>
Fred: "I'm required to say that. Dang, can we wrap this up? I can hear the Bixies." 
<br><br>
SM: "Without ears?" 
<br><br>
Fred: "Yes, without ears. Just like I talk without a mouth and sm- Just get on with it!" 
<br><br>
SM: "Fine fine. Any women in your life?" 
<br><br>
Fred: "Besides the Bixies? No. But I was flirting with some fine young ladies right before the interview. Told em my life story!" 
<br><br>
SM: "I'm sure they were all ears." 
<br><br>
Fred: "Shut up." 
<br><br>
"With that, a swarm of screaming Bixies crashed into the recording studio. I made it out with a few stings. Fred got out just fine, and some poor Bixie married a basketball. Until next time, Sir Maximus, signing out... ouch."
