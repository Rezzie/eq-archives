The two Rangers ran along the game trail, leaving little indication of their passage.  Taking long, distance-eating strides through the forests of Lesser Faydark, they hunted.  They had hunted for several hours with no sign of prey, and Maclir was becoming concerned.  This area should be teeming with animals, as far from civilization as it was.  The only city near here was that of the Gnomes, Ak'Anon, and they were not the hunting type.
<br><br>
Maclir slowed to a halt, Winter matching his pace, her frown indicating she also found the lack of prey confusing.  Maclir knelt and strained his elven ears in an attempt to find some sign of something to hunt.  They both stood still, listening.
<br><br>
After a few moments, Maclir raised his hand quickly, indicating he heard something.  Winter strained harder to hear, but heard nothing.  She quietly grumbled something about elves having dog ears when he shushed her and gestured for her to crouch down near a tree.  He then backed up near her and concentrated, using his limited magics to pull a cloak of camouflage about himself, rendering himself nearly invisible.  His half-elven companion followed suit.
<br><br>
For several moments, she heard nothing, not even Maclir's breathing, though she knew him to be right next to her and could feel his warmth near her.  Just about the time she was losing patience, she heard a high pitched voice in the distance.  She froze, listening intently, as the voice turned into two voices, both coming closer.
<br><br>
Down the path a bit, she saw them walking, neither over one foot tall.  Dark brown skin, the colour of Oak bark, with darker hair and goatees, they walked together, dragging the carcass of a rabbit between them.  Inwardly, she winced… Brownies.
<br><br>
 "Dubois, why are WE ze ones zat must to go hunting all ze time?" asked one of the Brownies to his companion.  "Eet is not like ze village is full of old ladies or anything.  I am sick lugging around carcasses when we could be faery hunting," the Brownie chuckled evilly.
<br><br>
Dubois grinned.  "Antoine, you are always moaning about ze faeries.  You know you will nevair catch one, zey are too quick.  Zut alors, zey can smell you a mile away."
<br><br>
Antoine elbowed his friend in the side, laughing.  "Oui, mon ami, but eef I could catch one, eet might be worth taking a bath!"
<br><br>
Winter heard something moving through the woods, making no attempt to mask its movements.  The Brownies heard it as well, quickly moving the rabbit into a shrub and vanishing from view.  A moment later, three figures came into view, hacking their way through the foliage, the bushes catching on their mail.  When they came into view, Winter's heart froze… Teir'dal.
<br><br>
Clad in dark indigo mail over dark blue and red uniforms, the figures wrestled themselves free of the underbrush and stepped onto the path.  Even in the half-light that made it through the forest canopy, the light was too bright to their eyes, causing them to squint as they gazed about.  Quietly speaking to each other in a language she did not understand, they conferred for a moment, then turned and walked up the path the direction from which the Brownies had come.
<br><br>
They had been gone for several heartbeats when Winter realized she had not been breathing.  Letting her breath out quietly, she felt Maclir's hand on her arm, holding her still.  She was about to protest his touch when the Brownies stepped from their hiding place, cursing.
<br><br>
Antoine glared after the dark elves, shaking a fist at them.  "Zat's right, inkie!  You run away!  And zere's more where zat came from!"
<br><br>
The other Brownie looked less confident, instead pulling on his friend to help with the rabbit.  They quickly made their way down the path, going the opposite direction that the Teir'dal took.
<br><br>
Maclir's hand lifted from her, and she felt his nearness withdraw.  A moment later, she saw him on the other side of the path, crouched down and motioning for her to follow.  She rose from her concealment and carefully made her way across.  
<br><br>
The older ranger was indicating the tracks of the Teir'dal, and made a hand motion indicating that they should follow them, backtracking their source.  Winter nodded and gestured for him to lead.  He rose slightly from his crouch and moved back along the trail that even the most novice of Rangers could have followed.
<br><br>
The trail wound around randomly, as the dark elven warriors obviously had no wood knowledge and detoured frequently to avoid obstacles.  After awhile, the track was circling a hillside when they heard voices.  They both paused to pull their camouflage about themselves again, vanishing into the foliage.  Winter reached forward and placed her hand on Maclir's back to keep them in contact, and they crept forward.
<br><br>
As they got closer, they realized that the voices they heard were not speaking but chanting.  An acrid smell reached their noses, causing their eyes to water as the reached a break in the trees.  Ahead, in a clearing, knelt a circle of robed Teir'dal that appeared to be praying.  They swayed back and forth, their eyes closed as they intoned some ritual.  In the center of the circle was a large bronze brazier, covered in arcane runes, low flames flickering in some macabre dance.
<br><br>
Shifting a bit, trying to get a better view, they moved around the hillside more.  The brazier seemed to glow in an unnatural light, the smoke shifting about the clearing though no wind disturbed it, as if exploring its surroundings.  Their study of the effect was interrupted by the sound of a voice that rumbled like an avalanche.
<br><br>
"How long?"  The troll stood well over 8'tall, and was bigger around than a young oak.  Across his back was a huge two-handed sword and his scaly body was covered in a patchwork of leather and chainmail armour.
<br><br>
The Teir'dal priest turned and regarded his giant companion.  "Soon, Prince Kral.  Soon."
<br><br>
Kral grumbled assent, turning to gaze at the swirling darkness.  "Better be soon.  Me want get on with it."  The troll clenched his fists, the sounds of grinding of scales-on-scales and popping of knuckles easily reaching the Rangers across the distance.  Then he turned and lumbered out of sight.
<br><br>
Winter felt Maclir backing up and followed suit.  Taking her hand in his, he led her away quickly and quietly, his grip strong and unyielding.  As soon as they were a few miles away, he shed his camouflage and stood, gazing at her.  Winter returned his gaze evenly and noted for the first time something she had never seen before in his eyes… fear.
<br><br>
"We must run.  Now. Follow and do not fall behind."  Maclir waited for her assent, then turned and took off into the woods.  Winter's longer legs allowed her to keep up easily and the two made haste to return to Kelethin.
<br><br>
It was dark by the time they were under the catwalks of the Wood Elven city.  Maclir stopped and asked a guard a quick question, then took off under the catwalks at an even faster pace.  He passed the last marker of the city and headed out into a tight grove of trees, coming to an abrupt halt at the edge of the grove and proceeding at a more respectful pace.
<br><br>
Winter heard a sound, like the creaking of trees in the wind, only it seemed to not be a random occurrence, and there was little wind.  Upon entering the grove, the source of the sound became apparent.  In the center of the grove was a huge oak treant, which was speaking rather animatedly (as animated as an oak treant could be, at any rate) with Lagniappe.  The diminutive druid was seated upon a stone with her feet tucked beneath her as the treant spoke to her in its own language, the sounds Winter had heard.  Winter gazed with rapt fascination at the talking tree.  She had seen similar ones in her home, the plains of Karanas, but never one quite so… big.
<br><br>
Maclir stopped at the edge of the grove and waited patiently for the conversation to abate.  The treant seemed rather distressed about something or another and Lagniappe appeared to be attempting to calm it, speaking softly in the closest thing she could achieve to its language, without being made of wood.  After several moments, she turned and noticed the pair of Rangers and smiled warmly.  Turning back to the treant, she said a few more things to it and made an obscure hand gesture.  The treant parroted the gesture with its… limbs… then turned and shambled out of the clearing.  She watched it depart, then walked up to the Rangers.  "How may I serve, my children?"
<br><br>
Maclir dropped to one knee, his head bowed, "I have grave news, my Lady, and felt you needed to hear it immediately."
<br><br>
Lagniappe held her hand out to the Ranger.  "Stand, Maclir.  I have no need of such formalities.  What is your news?"
<br><br>
Maclir stood quickly.  "Teir'dal are in the woods, my Lady.  And Trolls."
<br><br>
The Druid frowned, her beautiful features hardening perceptibly.  "Where?  How?  The dwarves would certainly have told us if any had gotten past the Butcher Block Mountains.  Somehow I doubt any could have managed to evade the children of Kaladim, given the zeal with which they perform their guardian duties."
<br><br>
Maclir shrugged.  "I do not know.  Winter and I were hunting in the faery lands of Lesser Faydark when we ran across a trio of Teir'dal.  Backtracking them, we found more of them worshipping around a shrine of some sort.  The Troll was there."
<br><br>
Lagniappe shook her head.  "This is bad news indeed, young Maclir.  You and Winter return to the city and wait.  I'll contact the others."
<br><br>
Maclir bowed awkwardly, then left the glade, Winter right behind him.  They returned to the city at a less hurried pace, Maclir's brow furrowed and his face clouding over like a coming storm.
<br><br>
Walking along side him in silence, Winter kept her thoughts to herself.  Like it or not, the war was coming to her.

Ozymandius lay in the bed of his room at the Lion's Mane Inn, grumbling.  His ribs had healed well enough, though they did hurt when he moved too quickly, but everyone insisted on treating him like he was old and decrepit.  He sat up, wincing as he did so, pushed himself to his feet, and donned his robe and boots.  Reaching for his staff, he headed out the door and down the stairs to the tavern.
<br><br>
He reached the common room as Nepenthia started up another tune about the Heroes of Qeynos.  She spotted him entering the room and scowled at him, but did not interrupt the song.  He made his way to a table, wincing at every reference to how "amazing" he was in the song, and sat down grumbling and cursing under his breath.  He certainly was not feeling very "amazing".
<br><br>
The waitress sauntered up to his table and smiled down at him warmly.  "What can I get you, hero?"
<br><br>
Ozymandius growled and glared at her, but she only chuckled and smiled broader.  "Ale, and some bread."
<br><br>
She curtsied to him, turned, and flounced away, laughing.  The old wizard put his face into his hands and sighed.  At the sound of someone clearing their throat, he lifted his gaze.
<br><br>
The bard Gellor stood across from him, looking like he had not slept in a week.  He pulled out a chair and sat down wearily, setting a stack of papers on the table.  Shuffling through the stack, he singled out a sheet and set it before the wizard.
<br><br>
Ozymandius took the sheet and read it carefully.  The waitress returned with a tray, setting a tankard of ale in front of the wizard, the bread board on the table, and a glass of wine in front of Gellor, winking slyly at him.  He smiled back, then took the glass and began sipping from it gingerly.
<br><br>
After a few moments of reading, the Erudite looked up at the bard.  "You are certain of this?  The translation is true?"
<br><br>
Gellor nodded.  "As true as I can make it.  I translated a good portion of the text, but this seemed to be the section we were looking for."
<br><br>
"Indeed.  If this is true, then we have Vashaar right where we want him."  Ozymandius glanced back at the document before him.  "According to this, he must take Freeport to have a way to get to Faydwer.  We hold Freeport, we win."  He closed his eyes, sighing and relaxing slightly.  Then he opened them again and gazed evenly at Gellor.  "You have done an excellent job, my young friend, and may very well have saved the world.  I owe you a debt of gratitude."
<br><br>
The half elf nodded again, then stood.  "I need to get some sleep, as I'm about to fall down.  If you need me, Nepenthia can find me."
<br><br>
Gellor bowed his head respectfully, then made his way towards the door, leaving Ozymandius poring over the documents before him.
