The smaller warrior, one of the companions to Serat, hesitated but only 
a second before bringing it to mention.  "See there oh mighty Serat, 
wouldst that be fear or love?"  The men burst to laughing and even the 
shrouded figure appeared to move.
<br><br>
I must admit I could but barely contain my laughter.

It was easy to see Serat was wealthy as well as beautiful by her exotic

"You there, man-child. Do you like what you see before you?
Be truthful and be not afraid to speak your mind. After all you are 
certainly protected from any harm by the spirits of peace" she said

speech. "You might have a bit of gold if it were my wish, but this 
weapon is for the warriors hands alone" as she placed the hilt of the 
black sword on Hameils knee. "Your destiny is only to wonder at my glory 
as I defeat my enemies and become rich beyond these merchants 
imaginations!" she laughed as she motioned to the half empty tavern.

I could hear the merchants as they began to openly appraise the weaponry 
of the adventurers. "It is true, we receive
many of our more exotic items from those following the path of war" said 
a voice.

Her companions joined in with her laughter. "Bring to us food befit 
warriors!" said another loudly. "This is peasant food and would not see 
us through a days travel."  A large mace smashing a fire stone sent the 
proprietor scampering for his best cuts of meat.
