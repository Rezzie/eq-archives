<b>Sentence and grammar structure</b>
<br><br>
I promise this won’t be long!  There are a few things that occur when you write which greatly affect your readability.  When I get an idea in my head, I tend to type furiously for a while, then look back and see various grammar sins. 
<br><br>
<b>Run-on sentences and sentence fragments</b>
<br><br>
"Grishnak lifted the heavy boulder from the door and noticed the bottom was slightly slimy while he carried it over the threshold, which was wooden with ornate scrollwork, slightly scarred with the many years of use it had weathered."  This is an example of a run-on sentence, which sort of makes sense as you begin to read it then loses coherence.  It needs to be broken down into two or maybe even three sentences.

"The boulder, slimy with blood, heavy with the dampness that soaked through it."  This is a sentence fragment.   Most sentences have a subject, verb, and object, i.e., X blanked Y.  Even though the first sentence has nouns and verbs, it does not have them acting on each other.
<br><br>
<b>Paragraphs </b>
<br><br>
A paragraph needs to be inserted when a new idea or thought is presented, or when a speaker changes (in dialogue between speakers).
<br><br>
<b>Ending a sentence with a preposition</b>
<br><br>
"Swords were something that Gishnak was good with.", which could be re-written as "Gishnak was good with swords.", or even "Gishnak’s prowess with bladed weapons was legendary."

On to more fun stuff!
<br><br>
<b>Telling the story</b>
<br><br>
Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as you write:
<br><br>
Show who your character is through action and dialogue.  Telling your readers who your character is won’t grab your readers attention as well as if they can see what that character can do and make their own conclusions.  The difference between "Grishnak is good with swords", and "As he drew his broadsword, Grishnak cut upwards to beat back the blade of the on-rushing orc. Faster than the orc could react, Grishnak lunged forward, spitting the orc through his torso", is the difference between holding your readers captive and chasing them away.
