The following is a little known passage from the New Testament, found recently by scholars. The contents are astounding:
<br><br>
<em>Teirlap, 3:12</em>
<br><br>
In the beginning, there was Aradune. Aradune was almighty, at least in his own mind, and he set out to create a beautiful 3D rendered land. It had plains, deserts, oceans, caves, mountains, and dungeons. He decided to name the land Norrath.
<br><br>
Next, Aradune decided to give Norrath life. He created villages, towns and cities and placed peoples there, 12 different races in all. Then, he created horrible monsters and majestic beasts and gave them homes as well. Aradune now named his creation EQ. After all that work, he was tired, so he decided to rest.
<br><br>
Weeks pass. Aradune's people prospered greatly, but he wanted them to have someone to look up to. Someone so perfect that all would strive to be like him. So Aradune created Teirlap, the human paladin. He was perfect in every way. Handsome, strong, charming, brave, intelligent, and kind. Teirlap was a basis for all the peoples of Norrath. He was the Hero.
<br><br>
Days passed. Aradune's idea worked. All the Norrathians strove to be like Teirlap.  But Teirlap himself was unhappy.
<br><br>
Teirlap said unto Aradune, "The Norrathians are good people, and they are very intelligent. Perhaps all would benefit if you created a race of people who were not so intelligent. This would create better balance." Aradune agreed with Teirlap's wise words.
<br><br>
And so, the Newbies were created. And Aradune marveled at the balance. For every High Elven scholar, there was a Halfling stumblebum walking about shouting, "Selling 2 Snake Fangs!" and "How do I run?! Plz tell me!" And yet Teirlap was still unhappy.
<br><br>
Teirlap said unto Aradune, "As great as your Norrathians and Newbies are, they will take YEARS to become half as great as I. Perhaps you should create a race of people who can acquire greatness with great haste." And Aradune agreed once again.
<br><br>
And so, the Powergamers and Kewl Doods were created. And Aradune was amazed at their speed. Through the use of "kiting", "kill stealing", and so-called "exploitz", these Powergamers and Kewl Doods became strong amazingly fast. Their strength did not rival Teirlap's, but their power impressed him.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Powergamers and Kewl Doods did not get along with the Newbies. When ever they met the Kewl Doods would say unto the Newbies, "U SUK NEWBI!!!" to which the Newbies would reply, "Can you heal me plz?". This rivalry amused Aradune. But still, Teirlap was not content.
<br><br>
Teirlap said unto Aradune, "Your world of Norrath is amazing, o mighty Aradune. But, I believe that Norrath has lost its roots. Perhaps you should create a race that's entire basis is to relive the glory days of Norrath's birth." Always eager to please, Aradune agreed.
<br><br>
And so, the Roleplayers were created.  And phrases never heard before in the history of Norrath rang out. Such as, "How art thee today, Lady Elowen? Thy beauty surpasses all that of the ocean." and "How much for this wonderful ring of enhanced agility and dexterity, my good man?"
<br><br>
And yet another rivalry was created. Whenever the Roleplayers stopped and said "Hail." to a Powergamer, the Powergamer would respond with "U SUK DUM NEWBI RP!!!" Aradune was greatly pleased with his latest accomplishment. But, to no one's surprise, Teirlap was still upset.
<br><br>
Teirlap said unto Aradune, "Even though all your peoples are striving to become all powerful like me, o great and powerful Aradune, they all do it in the same manner. Perhaps you could create something that separates one person from another." Aradune did not want to fail Teirlap, so he did what he was asked.
<br><br>
And so, classes were created. And, o, were they unbalanced. Norrathians now complained about everything. Screams of "My class can't solo.", "My spells are underpowered.", and "We don't get any good class-only items like Paladins do." were now commonplace. Teirlap was a bit skeptical, but satisfied for the time being. He was extremely happy with Aradune so far, but he wanted just one last thing.
<br><br>
Teirlap said unto Aradune, "I look on your creation of EQ in admiration, o mighty Aradune. But I have one final request. I wish there was a way for Norrathians to earn a living other than slaying various monsters. Perhaps a new skill of some sort."
<br><br>
Aradune scowled at Teirlap, and said unto him, "No! I have done much for you, Teirlap, but making trade skills would be bad for the economy, and I will not stand for that."
<br><br>
Teirlap then said unto Aradune, "That is it! I have had it with this charade! I hate EQ! I hate Norrath!  I hate your unbalanced classes, I hate your stupid Newbies, but most of all I hate you! I'm leaving." And with that, Teirlap began to walk away.
<br><br>
Aradune was taken aback. His favorite creation was leaving him? "But…But…Where are you going, Teirlap?"
<br><br>
Teirlap stopped and said unto Aradune, "To beta test Asheron's Call.".
<br><br>
And with that, Teirlap left Norrath and was never seen again.
