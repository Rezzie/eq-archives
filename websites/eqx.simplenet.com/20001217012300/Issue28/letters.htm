<em>A response to <a href="../Issue27/letters.htm">a letter</a> from Levine in Issue 27.</em>
<br><br>
Ahh, another post about why we, the ops of #everquest, fail to live up to
your expectations.  This is another in the saga of posts about why our
channel is just awful, a waste of time, full of idiots, and (here it comes!)
how the ops are facists.
<br><br>
Let me expand a bit point by point on some of the accusations.  First of
all, the repeated story that an op banned someone without reason.  I think
this little legend is due to a few things - 1) Misunderstandings between
what a "kick" is and what a "ban" is, and 2) The person witnessing the act
not knowing the history of the situation.  Let me elaborate.  It is a rule
in our channel that we usually warn twice, then kick (which lets the user
right back in the channel) as a third warning, and then if they persist a
TEMPORARY ban may take place.  I am looking at our permanent ban list right
now and it is mainly people who tried to take over the channel and very few
"troublemakers".  Secondly, there is a history to each person who takes part
in the chat in the channel.  Some have repeatedly been obnoxious, rude, etc.
to channel members and ops - so if you see someone quickly getting kicked it
is most likely due to this.  Also there is the matter of private messages.
Many conversations leak over into private chat.  During more than a few
debates in EQ we get msged by the side we are arguing with that we am any
number of things.  Back and forth this goes.  Is kicking or banning used to
silence someone?  You bet.  We are here to facilitate a good environment for
discussion, if someone is disrupting that then they get warned, etc.
<br><br>
Let me also describe some of the "controlled chaos" that we deal with in the
channel.  With beta drawing near many people join the channel just plain
lying, this is how rumors get started.  We attempt to control that so we are
not known as a place where rumors begin.  Also, when a member of 989 Studios
enters the channel the following happens.  People try to "nuke" the person
off of the net.  People try to "nuke" the whole channel.  People try to
disrupt the chat.  People only want themselves to be heard so they are as
obnoxious as possible.  People msg the 989s person over and over with
questions and requests.  All in all, pure and total chaos.  Not to mention
we get msged dozens of times.  It becomes work - and we're not getting paid
for this.  Read that line again - this is not a JOB, we do not get paid by
989s, we do not get special favors - we do this because we're fans.
<br><br>
As for us being "official" - we're not.  We don't have 989 Studios looking
after us.  We don't report to them.  We DO have a good relationship with
them, however, and we do what we can to let them use our channel for chats,
etc.  I have not been called for phase 1 beta, I do not get special
privledges.  This is an absurd idea.  Shon, who is in marketing for 989s,
does a lot of really good PR for our channel, but also does it for all the
fan websites out there.  At E3 he said to me "People are surprised when I
fed ex their website some EQ info, they shouldn't be, we're here for the
fans."  And thats what #everquest is there for also - for fans of everquest.
<br><br>
Now, onto the ops themselves.  I had a running joke with a few of my op
friends that I get called a facist at least once a week.  Now, let's take
some serious evaluation.  We have visited so many other EQ related IRC
channels it's ridiculous.  We have asked what they thought of #everquest,
what they would like to see different, etc.  Ask around, many guilds have
had me visit their channels and I had a wonderful time in all of them.  We
have visited non guild channels also.  We have had lengthy discussion with
many of the ops of each of these.  I think we have done more than most
channels have done to say "Okay, how can we improve?"
<br><br>
I have known most of the ops for years.  We are a tight knit community of
gamers and gaming fans.  Many of us, who use their ISPs and not corporate
addresses, work for game companies.  Do we call each other names sometimes?
You bet.  After Blkstaff kills me in Starcraft for the 100th time I can
garauntee you I will have some choice words for him.  Do we let it interfere
with the channel?  I sure hope not.  I have yet to see that happen.
<br><br>
So, Levine and Absor, what are your problems?  You write as if the channel
is destroying your gaming experience, when it's as simple as typing /quit to
leave the channel.  We don't force you into the channel.  We are trying to
develop part of the EQ community.  If you can't be part of that, then leave,
we certainly have no use for you, and we doubt the channel does.  Can we
bend the way the channel runs to make you happy?  No.  No.  No.  Too many
people want to see different things in the channel, and guess what?  Not all
of that can be contained in one channel.  We loved the fact that #Norrath
opened to facilitate guild recruitment (which we don't allow) etc.  We think
all of these channels have a wonderful niche just like ours.  We work hard
to make this channel work and it's dissapointing to see people like you two
spread half truths and misguided opinions on the hard work of others.

<br><br>
<em>[Ed: I figure the best thing for me to do is just let you read what I
told Soltan...
<br><br>
Thanks for the letter.  I am an infrequent user of IRC and have little
opinion one way or the other regarding your channel.  But I certainly
understand that some of us have to deal with accusations and negative
feelings for doing something purely for the sake of the fans of EverQuest,
without pay.  EQX is not a job for me either.  So I certainly understand.
<br><br>
I also want to thank you for the generally polite and informative tone of
your letter.]</em>
<br><br>
I spend about as much time on #everquest as many Ops do, and I happen to
find it one of the better administrated channels.  Ops have to deal with
all manner of behavior, from the joke-taken-one-step-too-far to the
outright abusive.  While different Ops have different styles, I have yet to
see an op do something that I really didn't agree with.  We are lucky, too,
to have a set of Ops that can restore the channel after multiple takeover,
nuke, and flood attempts.
<br><br>
To all the Ops of #everquest, THANK YOU.

To Absor:
<br><br>
First, let me start off this letter by saying you do a wonderful job at 
the EverQuest Express. 
<br><br>
Now onto why I am actually writing. Brymen <a href="../Issue27/ramble.htm">(In A Rambling about Roleplaying in Everquest - Issue 27)</a> has fallen into the classic 
Ultima Online trap. That trap is "Why try to fix something when I can 
complain about it." I understand that he is trying to write about a 
topic he wishes to not see in EverQuest. The thing he fails to do is 
actually say how one can correct the problem. A bit of time ago I 
started a guild for people who like to role-play evil characters. I had 
a lot of people who never role-played before and were your classic PK on 
Ultima Online. I talked to them about it and now they shunned what they 
did as low-brow. They actually have written character profiles! That is 
some change. Now, I don't feel all high and mighty about the subject but 
I taught people how to FIX what they are doing rather than complaining 
about it.
<br><br>
Let's go point by point.
<br><br>
One- Spelling and Grammar - I also hated people who could not write a 
sentence, but I never saw any people who totally messed up or even used 
the word "doodz" in a sentence. I played Ultima Online for nine months 
and I can say that the only people I saw use the words "doodz" were 
those who were mocking pk'ers. Also, would it suddenly be correct if I 
put "OOC:" in front? Yes, it would. Most people feel you can say "OOC: 
Guys, I have to leave in a few minutes let's make this quick." Yet, no 
one ever teaches this to anybody. I used to play a text MUD where the 
first thing you were given was not directions but etiquette. That is 
what other games need to start doing.
<br><br>
Two- Finding people who can not role-play - These are the people you 
should help the most. Suprisingly, first talk "Out of Character" with 
them and refer them to a site where it teaches you how to role-play your 
character better. Most people are appreciative. If you start to lecture 
why "Non Role-Play" is bad you get the typical teen-aged reaction. 
"Haha! Shut up, this is only a game." I say teen-aged because I am a 
teen-ager and I feel people try to lecture us all the time. I role-play 
and suddenly I am mature for my age. I go to a message board and then I 
see people say why teen-agers should learn respect. No one wants to have 
parents on a game.
<br><br>
Three- Talking Brittanian- The biggest farce and turn off to the "non 
role-players" was thinking role-play only occurred when you spoke 
Elizabethan English. First of all, Elizabethan would not fit in because 
in the time of Queen Elizabeth they had gun powder. These games have no 
gun powder. If it was realistic they would be talking in Old English. 
Saying "thee" does not mean you are good at role-playing it only means 
you took the time to read the site about how to talk Middle English.
<br><br>
People should learn to teach rather than to criticise. If they did that 
we would have the "fantasy world" in which you speak.
