"Run!"  Those were the first words I heard as I entered the pass in the Steamfont Mountains.  Of course that shocked me after a rather peaceful journey from Felwithe.  My first reaction was to draw my two bastard swords from their sheathes, my second was to look for the person that the words came from.  Not twenty yards in front of me, near a huge cave mouth, I see a human dressed in robes come running out of the opening full steam right at me.
<br><br>
I lower my swords and break out into laughter at seeing an old friend running with his tail between his legs.  It is not often that I laugh, but this is a sight for sore eyes.  "Jagang!  Why are you fleeing from that cave?" I bellow towards him.
<br><br>
It was then that I realized, finally seeing the fear in his eyes, and feeling the faint vibrations in the ground, that he was running for a very good reason.  "Elaan, no time for greetings now, just run. Run faster than you have in all your life!"  Jagang puffs in hysteria.
<br><br>
Faintly I heard parts of his frenzied statement, but my eyes were on the cave opening.  It isn't often that one gets to see a giant.  The fear had gripped me and was holding me steadfast. A most beautiful sight appeared before me, something of fairy tales and myth.  Never in my life had I seen anything quite so large. I wasn't about to leave without taking it all in.  His hands were the size of my body, and his mouth could swallow me whole.  The bulging muscles were nothing short of tremendous, and I understood that with one little flick of his huge hand he could crush me like an ant.
<br><br>
Jagang grabs me as he runs past, knowing well that I wasn't going to leave of my own accord.  His tugging at me awakens me out of my catatonic state and I realize that my life may be in jeopardy.   I sheathe my swords and break into a full run, knowing well that if I falter that I will be someone's lunch.
<br><br>
"Where are we to flee to Jagang?  This beast will be upon us in moments, and will surely not mind having both of us as a meal!"  I scream fearfully, feeling the vibrations in the ground growing stronger by the moment.
<br><br>
"We run until our lungs burst, and then we run some more.  Hopefully he will tire of chasing us and return back to his home!"  Jagang yells, nearly out of breath.  I notice a faint smile on his face.  Jagang was always the crazy one, trying to take on beasts that would take an army of men to fell.
<br><br>
The path that we were running down was the one that I had just journeyed in on.  Something clicked in my head and I remembered something that may save us from this behemoth.  If my memory served me correctly, there was a small cave just about a hundred yards from where we were.  Small enough that a giant surely could not but fit one or two fingers in through the entrance.  I motion quickly to Jagang to follow me and sprint towards the direction I remembered it to be in.
<br><br>
Jagang had no idea of what was going on, but had no problem with trusting me with his life.  This made me feel like a real Paladin, knowing that people had faith enough in me to follow me even in such dire situations as this.  With that thought, I knew I could not let him down or myself for that matter.  
<br><br>
Sure enough, there the cave was, right where I remembered it being.  I just hope that the inhabitants of this one aren't as hostile.  I look over to Jagang just in time to see a look of relief wash over his features.  Once again I smile, which is a huge task with a giant fast on your trail.
<br><br>
We reach the entrance not a moment before the giant reached us.  As soon as we ran inside the monster was jabbing his large digits in to the cave opening, nearly crushing us as he did.  His howls of frustration almost brought the walls down around us, and surely woke up any inhabitants this small dwelling may hold.  
<br><br>
A flash of light blinds me for a moment as Jagang lights a torch to inspect our haven.  It looks to be abandoned, except for the giant's fingers constantly prodding around trying to reach one of us.  This is a relief, considering we would be like a rat trapped in a cage if it wasn't.  
<br><br>
"So, what are you doing all the way out here Elaanilus? It isn't like you to adventure by yourself."  Jagang questions, knowing that something is amiss.
<br><br>
I smile a crooked smile that is one of my trademarks, and proceed to answer him.  "Well, it looks as if we are going to have a long time to get reacquainted, so I guess I will start at the beginning."
