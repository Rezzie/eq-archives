There are also multiple paths from point A to point B that can be traveled to get to a destination.  That is where routing protocols come in, but that’s a future issue.  Now your PC sends a message requesting a connection from the game server out in the cloud somewhere. When a TCP connection first opens, both ends can send the maximum datagram size they can handle.  The smaller of these numbers is used for the rest of the connection.  A connection is then established after a series of messages back and forth.  Now game information is broken up into datagrams and sent out.  It might take 15 datagrams to complete one piece of information.  These datagrams are numbered so that the receiver can reassemble the data in the correct order so it makes sense.

So lets say a trace route shows that its 22 hops from your PC to the Game server, with an average ping (a program that uses ICMP replies) of 220ms.  That’s the time it takes a packet to leave your PC, travel to the destination address, and back again.  
<br><br>
Each of these 15 datagrams leaves your PC, travels across the Internet through each of these 22 hops, and arrives at the server, where they are reassembled in order, and forwarded up to the application layer.  Then answered and sent back to you.

Okay now with this awareness of networking, lets say that for some reason; one of the 15 datagrams did not reach the server.  The server has 14 of the 15 datagrams.  He must now send a request back for the lost datagram while holding the other 14.
<br><br>
Although these processes happen in milliseconds, you can see if a packet is lost, or delayed repeatedly, it can really cause a lot of problems in your game
