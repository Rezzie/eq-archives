<big><big>S</big></big>ome RPG's, like EQ or AD&D, decide for game balance purposes to limit player endeavor to certain "classes".  These classes can become limiting factors in a roleplayer's desire to make a unique character.  How many of us have said "I want to play an elf fighter-mage" and proceeded to allow the race/class abilities/limitations decide *who* that character is?  We need to be able to think "outside the lines" drawn for us by game designers.
<br><br>
	The first step is character concept.  Who is this person?  Where did they come from?  What sort of character "seed" can you build from to create a coherent, believable persona?  Some suggestions for character building points are:
	<br><br>
	Fiction - Have you read any good books lately? :)  Believable characters abound in fiction and not only SF/Fantasy.  I once used the Victorian "gentleman burglar" Raffles concept to make a noble thief who stole for the "art" of it, only attempting daring, next-to-impossible thefts.
	<br><br>
	Selfish desire - Is there something you always wished you could have done in real life, but couldn't?  Act through your character concept and express yourself!

Game design - as long as you don't limit yourself to a race/class restriction, you can certainly use the game design.  I love playing dwarves, and my concept often starts out with "I wanna be a dwarf".
<br><br>
	Power - a much misaligned character "seed".  Why not want the best and the most?  Make it *interesting* though.  The key is to imagine yourself in the characters place, and justify those desires with who the character is and act through the character's persona.  For example:
	<br><br>
	You want a character who is powerful, and can affect the course of nations.  Class is immaterial, really, since all classes can become powerful.   Take a "fighter" class, make him charismatic and thoughtful, and *poof* you have Alan of Battlewile, whose family was once renowned for their ability in battle and is currently in disrepute.  He's the 5th son whose brothers are a bunch of fops.  Disgusted by his family's lack of spine, he trains to become a warrior and sets out on his own, using the gold obtained through adventuring to hire people to do his bidding.  Investing in merchant ventures, he earns enough money to create a world-wide courier organization, with fees for delivery for magical and mundane courier service.  The couriers act as spies, and soon Alan is a powerful information broker.   He trains and equips a mercenary army that strikes at *just* the right time to save an nation's fortunes, and is knighted by the king...

Once you have your character concept, you then need to fit it in the existing race/class system.  The character I hope to play, Oghma, is inspired by the Celtic God of Knowledge, Bards and Strength - Oghma.  In that concept there are several key elements.  The character is a repository of cultural information, and he is physically powerful.  Since I like dwarves, and dwarves are strong, I like the idea of a dwarven bard, but bard is not necessarily the correct class.  As a character he is a bard only in the "transmission of knowledge" sense.  He could also be a fighter, since the bardic song/spell ability really fits peripherally into the concept.  As an individual, he would train more in things outside the bardic spell realm if possible.  If started as a bard, he would wind up with high smithing and say, minor wrestling skills (the Celtic god was the best wrestler of the gods), with lore and knowledge being his intellectual focus.  Spell/song abilities would be secondary. He could also be a Cleric, with a "holy mission".  It is even conceiveable that he be an Enchanter, going more towards showing the dwarven magic with armor and weapons... One of the things I like about dwarves is their smithing ability, a creative force much like the desire to create songs and tales.  So where does this put me as Oghma?
