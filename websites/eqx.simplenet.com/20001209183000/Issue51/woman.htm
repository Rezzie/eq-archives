	A professor of mine once told me that men have their thoughts concentrated in a narrow cone of view, while woman have their thoughts concentrated within a bubble around their head. Meaning that men concentrate on one thing, very intently, while women have many things circling around. Basically, women multitask better than men. 
<br><br>
	This could not have applied better to the previous article <a href="../Issue47/women.htm">Women Vs. Internet gaming</a>. Men with their intense concentration on games, (such as quake II) or on sports, as most women know, give bad examples to women for the love of that sport or game. Of course if we are watching you play quake so intensely that you drown out everything around you and become furious when you get killed because your teammate does not cover your ass, we laugh. Quake is not the game to introduce any female to Internet gaming. 
<br><br>
	I speak from experience because a little over a year ago I was at my boyfriends and he was upstairs playing on his computer while I was doing some paperwork. I became bored and decided to see what he was doing. He was playing a RPG game called Legends of Kesmai. Now, at first the game did not seem too exciting, rather crude graphics and simple interface would have been a definite turn off for me, but it was the interaction and multiple things going on at once that I liked. When I saw him chatting with six other people while killing a dragon, working together, then deciding who got what loot and going back to town to relate their battle with others, I found myself drawn to the game- not particularly the game itself, but the type of game,  a RPG.
<br><br>
	RPG's gave me what I wanted in a game; first, escapism: it let me get away from my mundane life. Second would be relationships with new people.  I made all these friendships with people from all over the world that I knew I would never meet or talk to, it let me be myself with these people. The third would be fantasy- who wouldn't want to be able to do what you can do in a RPG? 
<br><br>
	I started playing that game for a while, joined a great guild (which I'm still a member of) and eventually looked for better looking RPG's. For a bit, I found Ultima Online. Here I found more females than in LOK and was very pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the graphics, and the friendships I made. The problem was pk'ing. In 1 ½ months I was killed 30 times and of those 30 times only 2 of them were by monsters. I was disgusted by the ratio of being pk'ed to being killed by monsters so I threw my UO CD into my fireplace. Now of course I am anxiously waiting for EQ.
<br><br>
	Now guys, here's the important part of this. The most annoying thing in any game that I have played in the last year, was the annoying jerks who say stupid things such as "nice legs, babe" or how about "oh I think I'm in love, will you marry me?" and my favorite "hey are you injured?" I answered "No, why?" "cuz that fall from heaven must've hurt". Jeez . So corny it makes me want to gag. Guys women who do play RPG's don't want to be hit on - if we did we'd be in an IRC room. That, next to pk'ing is the worst thing for me in online gaming.
<br><br>
	I hope this gave you a good insight on how women view online RPG's.  I truly hope you think about this the next time you want to give a cheesy compliment to the rare female you do see playing EQ or any other RPG. We get so much objectifying (even from EQ Express's weekly artwork) that we just want to play the games and be treated as a friend, not someone to be "hit on".
