<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings!  Probably a question that's been answered before -- how do I check to see how my skills are progressing numerically -- I look at the skills chart in my persona regularly, and see feeble, below average, etc. -- is there a way to see the numbers except for when they advance?
<br>
Thanks! Caileb (Karana)
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You might want to keep a pen and paper handy on this one (goose quills work fine and some sort of paper product should be available somewhere in Norrath).  There is no way I know of to check the numbers on your skills except as they advance.    The more detail oriented people I know make a chart of their skills and then keep track of their progress as they go.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a short question which I have been wondering since my first day of playing Everquest. Throughout Norrath there are glowing white circles with the same symbol in the center of it as the get to Neriak has. This circles have 4 little symbols around it and I have heard they are used for summoning but have not seen anyone use them for that. Thanks for answering and hopefully you can clear this question up for me.
<br>
Aaldar the High Elf Enchanter
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm wondering if someone is taking the "stump Nep" challenge altogether too seriously.  I did try to find out what the symbols and rings are for and although I was told that the circles are indeed for some sort of use by druids and wizards, no one seemed to think the symbols themselves had any meaning except decoration.  Of course, there was an enchanter I ran into who replied to my questions with the most devious smile followed by, "Wouldn't You like to know?", so perhaps there is an undiscovered secret there.   That's about the best I can do for you on the question for now.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it that determines the rate your skills go up with use?  Is it intelligence, as I've heard?  If so, how much of an effect is it and how does it work?  If not, is it simply the same rate for all uses of that skill with that function?
<br>
Kadrin
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A ranger friend of mine who probably has spent way too much time in the woods lately, claims that the only determinant of the rate your skills go up is your sex appeal.  However, I'm pretty sure from the chorus of laughter following his pronouncement and the comments correcting  his assertion, that in fact, your intelligence is the major factor beyond your race, class and level for the rate your skills go up with use.  I have no idea how intelligence works here although I suspect it's possible that somehow the word algorithm might be applicable here?  I have heard the word used and decided to throw it in although, quite frankly, they never taught us in bard school exactly what it meant.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you clarify critical hits a bit please.  For example when our group was fighting an adult mammoth one of the warriors got a critical hit that said 23 in parenthesis after it.  Is this the amount of damage it did or something else?  If it is the damage  it sure wasn't much on a mob that has about 800 hp. Also does a critical hit do anything else?
<br>
Seladon
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the parenthesized number after the critical hit text is the amount of damage done by the critical hit.  Note that there is the possibility of a bonus 1, 2 or 3 damage points that would be added on to the critical hit.  Thus, if you critted someone for 110 and your bonus points were 3, the actually damage would be 113.   Beyond the damage, it's my understanding that a critical hit has no additional effect.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in answer to what languages are out there... BARBARIAN, is also on the list. I do have a question though ~ What good is knowing these languages? Can you actually use them? Speak Dragon with another and others ( not knowing it ) not understand? Thanks!
<br>
Shania, Ranger 13th Circle
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the reminder on the Barbarian language which I lazily cast into the pool of race-specific languages.  Yes you can use languages but as far as what more erudite (pun intended) people than me have said, the main necessity for them is to read books that may set out spell components and other bits of hidden knowledge or wisdom.  I remember my good friend Gellor the Bard sitting scribbling away at one language  or another in his lore studies, but I never did get a chance to ask him if he actually learned anything useful from them or not.   Oddly, not long after he was dipping into an ancient tome I had never seen before, he simply disappeared.  If you happen upon him, ask Gellor for me what use he ever did make of all those languages.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nimble fingered rogue, does the amount of money I, ahem, borrow from my enemies pockets detract from the total money at the end of battle? I think it doesn't as I have looted about a gold off of goblin's in Misty Thicket and they end up giving the same amount as they did when I didn't lighten their purses. Could you please confirm or deny this?
<br>
Sedimin
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, according to my rogue friend Mathgen and to my longtime rogue source who still won't remove that silly drapery off his head so I can see who he is, the money that you manage to "borrow" from an npc enemy does not detract from the total money found on the corpse should your group prevail in the battle.  What amazed me was that apparently rogues have successfully "lifted" gems and armor and even weapons, but nary a lute or lyre.  Seems like if rogues are going to be genuinely useful they could manage to keep their bard friends in instruments!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I gathered the components, and created a quest item called "testament of vanear."  It is a wis +10 mana +10 item, useable by all/all, but can't be equipped~!!!  I even talked to a gm about it, but he said that he didn't know why it had stats, it couldn't be used.  A website stated that there is a rumor that the item will be changed in the future.  Have you heard anything about this situation?
<br>
Ravenknight Graywolf
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent information I could find said that the "Testament of Vanear" is either bugged or not yet complete.  However, I want to qualify that answer by saying it was given to me over several pints of honey mead and it could be the person was trying to be helpful without really knowing the true situation.  I will definitely not close off the question and would appreciate any additional information anyone has.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latest update for Rogues (rare as that might be), rogues can Sneak and hide simultaneously, walking unseen. I know that many undead and other monsters can see players with "camo" and "invis" spells on. can some monsters also see sneak/hiding rogues?
<br>
Jete the Rogue
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever said rogues were secretive was overgeneralizing.  Mathgen most kindly answered my questions and said that there are monsters who can see sneaking/hiding rogues.  However, not all monsters that can see invisible can also see hidden players.  For the most part, you should watch out for higher level monsters like the more dangerous goblins and you should test out the sneak/hide carefully when you are learning a zone.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a response to the pie question in issue#89. To make pies you must omit the spices. The recipes are incorrect. (I've made meat, berry, fruit and vegetable pies.)
<br>
Silverflower
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really a question but an answer to the pie problem presented in issue 90.  Yes clump of dough can be made! 1 Milk, 1 flour, 1 egg (snake egg).  Pies can also be made however the recipe books are wrong!  To make a berry pie use: 1 dough. 1 pie tin, 1 berries.  This will make 2 pies.  Fruit pies have never succeeded for me resulting in  the message "you have combined the items to fashion an alternate product" but no product generated.  The recipe for berry pies I listed will result in 2 pies and the return of the pie tin.
<br>
Anian Barkskin
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, Nepenthia! As a master baker, I can state conclusively that I have baked many pies, including meat pies, berry pies, fruit pies, rat ear pies, veggie pies, and the ever-popular beetle eye pie.
<br><br>
For those struggling bakers who have had difficulty mixing up a clump of dough -- bah, amateurs! -- simply place a snake egg, milk, and cup of flour in a MIXING BOWL, and combine.  If you have been making your dough in a spit or oven up until now, that's your problem.  (This may also explain why some smiths pull ruined swords out of a kiln, and some failed potters never successfully extract a pie tin from the forge they're using.)  I hope this info comes in handy to my fellow culinary questers!
<br>
Krimp
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the person who said that the clump of dough does not work, it does now.  It seems that as the patched some out, some food item work and others are broken.  I know that a clump of dough did not work 2 patches ago but now it does, just combine the ingredients mentioned in a mixing bowl and it will work.  As for baking pies, I hear that you have to not put spices in as mentioned in the cook book or you can kiss you pie tin goodbye.
<br>
Starfury7 (I have 9 characters, so anyone won't work)
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is regarding issue #90's questions about dough and making pie.  In order to make dough, you need a mixing bowl!  In this bowl you combine your milk, flour, and egg.  I have seen these for sale at certain baker's stores.  Also if you all do not already know, you will need to contact a potter for your advanced recipes for your pie tin, pot (for stew), smoker (if you enjoy elf meat for some reason), and skewers.  These are not 'used up' so long as your recipe is right (whether you fail or succeed you will have it returned), but BE CAREFUL!  I have ruined one pot already by forgetting the water in my rabbit stew.  Oh also about those pies... they make many servings, it is very nice (use vegetables!).  Pleasant baking!
<br>
Rashana Depravier
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clump of dough is indeed working now, though I have not yet acquired the skill to make it myself. It is 1 snake egg, 1 cup of flour, 1 bottle of milk combined in a mixing bowl. Pies have been made by several people, but it seems they only work if spices are left out.
<br>
Teona
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to Coventina's problems with pie, the given recipe for Dough (Milk, Flour, Snake Egg) is perfectly correct. There are two possible things that could have been done wrong:
<br><br>
1: The attempt to combine was done in a spit or oven. Dough is made in a mixing bowl.
<br><br>
2: The wrong type of flour is used. When buying flour for dough, don't buy it from a bakery like Voleen's in Qeynos. That particular flour weighs only 0.1 (in EQ weight measurements) The flour you are looking for is sold from the shops that sell Spices, Sauces, Garnish, etc... and weighs 0.2.
<br><br>
Also though, if you are going to make pie I should warn you that most of the recipes are erroneous. They all state to use Spices, Clump of Dough, Pie Tin, and the other ingredient that makes the pie what it is, (Fruit for Fruit Pie, Rat Ears for Rat Ear Pie) but in truth none of the recipes except for Beetle Eye Pie use Spices at all.   I hope that helps but I will tell you that if you are having trouble with a recipe, they are all possible somehow. Some of the recipes are wrong, but I fiddled around with them all (At the expense of many Pie Tins, Pots, Muffin Tins and more) and discovered that it IS possible to make all the recipes albeit with having to deal with failed combinations. Some of them make no sense however (Fresh Fish + Wasp Wing for Gator Rolls??) and I have sent in bug reports to no avail. Perhaps they'll get around to it. As for the minor magical food, I think the idea is great. Perhaps with enough prodding from different bakers, who knows?

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding making clumps of dough...  The ingredients need to be combined in a mixing bowl, not an oven/spit.
<br>
Exarian Waterlight
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regards to making pies, I had to go on a quest to make Rat Ear Pies, and would assume that most pies are made in similar fashion.  From a baker, buy 1 cup of flour, 1 bottle of baking spirits, and a bowl. Open bowl (it is a container with 4 slots and a combine button). Place flour and bottle of spirits in bowl, along with 1 giant rat ear, or 2 regular rat ears (not stacked). Press Combine and you get an Uncooked Rat Ear Pie.  Now place the pie in the oven (all by itself) and press Combine. You get a Rat Ear Pie!  Note that you can mix as many pies as you want with 0 baking skill, to increase your skill. However, placing the pie in the oven will fail every time if your baking is below 10! I bought out Qeynos' entire supply of Giant Rat Ears to find this out. :-)

</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, not so much as a question as an answer.  In Issue 90, Conventina inquired about dough( for the  baking of pies ).  Indeed, dough can be made, quite easily in fact(trivial to my skill of around 25-30).  The given recipe(Snake Egg, Milk, and a cup of flour) works quite readily...when made in a MIXING BOWL.  I've had the same trouble...can't make the dough in an oven, has to be the bowl. In fact, I have gotten far as preparing an uncooked rat ear pie(had to try the rat ear recipe...I can't find pie tins for the life of me, and the rat ear recipe I have doesn't require one) although I was not quite skillful enough to actually bake the pie. Pie's do exist, no matter how elusive they may be.
<br>
Meffin
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question.. just a response... when you make dough, be sure and use a MIXING BOWL!!! =)  Try the recipe there. It does work. I've done it.  When you go to make pies tho, LEAVE THE SPICES OUT! They are borked.
<br>
Frashii, 21st song Bard Tarew Marr Seekers of Lore
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, not a question, just some info on pie baking.  Clumps of dough do exist.  I haven't found any place to buy them, but you can make them with the recipe mentioned in issue 90 (Snake Egg, Milk, Flour).  Only they have to be combined in a mixing bowl, not a spit or a oven.  Otherwise you get the 'these items don't combine' message.  Of course, before you start baking pies, realize that the recipes are wrong in the books.  The only pie that needs spices in the beetle eye pie.  Hope this helps.
<br>
Bortoas
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the dough question, you have to combine the flour, milk, and egg in a mixing bowl.  I believe the bowls can be bought from NPCs, or from your local potter.
<br>
Daggon of Rivervale
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer to the question in Issue #90 in regards to baking pies.  Yes, it is a working recipe, but a two step process with different containers.  Here is how it is done:
<br><br>
Clump o' Dough:  1 Snake Egg, 1 Cup of Flour, 1 Bottle Milk.  Combine in a MIXING BOWL to make Clump o' Dough.
<br><br>
XXXXX Pie:  1 Clump o' Dough, 1 XXXXX Ingredient (XXXXX = berries, fruit, vegetables, etc), 1 Pie Tin.  Put all items in an OVEN (or Spit) and combine to make a pie.
<br><br>
The recipe books say to use Spices as well.  You do not need to use Spices and it will actually ruin the pie if you add them in.  Happy pie baking and be sure to make friends with a friendly wood elf, ranger, or druid who can provide many foraged ingredients!
<br>
Andrea, Ranger of Tunare, Bristlebane Server
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello. I have been working on the Baking skill. What you need to make Clump of Dough is to use Flour+Milk+SnakeEgg - Mixed in a MIXING BOWL.And to make a pie, just follow the recipes in the cookbooks but leave out the spices, and granting on the chance of the skill you'll make the pie. I hope that answers any questions you may have or that persons.  Drop me a line if you have any more questions I'll do my best to answer them.

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you all for the lovely responses.  I was just going to list your names but each letter gave a great individual insight into the toils and troubles and the successes of baking so they are all included for your enjoyment.  Now this makes me very curious, not to mention hungry, but has anyone found a way to bake brownies in Norrath.  (And not the brownies in Lesser Faydark who always vehemently object to my music either -- I mean the chocolate kind!)  I was also wondering if any of you have gourmet questions we can direct to the chefs and bakers of various races?  Maybe eventually this bard will be rolling in plat from a comprehensive "Joy of Norrathian Cooking" running into its 10th or more printing.  Ah, sigh, nice dream anyway but if anyone knows where I could get some baked brownies, do let me know.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Issue 90, some one sent in a list of how people could look upon you... (s)he left out the very highest, "kindly considers you"...  I have only been able to get liked this much by the guards of Kaladim, sadly...  my own elven guards don't even like me that much!
<br>
Wyndorn Windchaser  
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw your list of cons, and just wanted to mention that "judges you kindly" is in between amiably and warmly.
<br>
Raadt Blare
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question, but a clarification to an answer someone else provided:
<br><br>
The list is:Kindlywarmlyamiablyindifferentlyapprehensivelydubiouslythreateninglyscowls
<br><br>
A previous answer left out the 'kindly' one, and I am pretty sure that that is as high as it goes.  I have improved my faction with merchants, and for every improvement message I received, I got a slightly better price.  But after being kindly for a while, I noticed that I stopped getting better prices, and that most items had an 'even' selling price...i.e. I sold crafted gauntlets for 211 pp and no change, when I at lower con's I got silver copper and gold also.
<br>
Ma`ar
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This response is directed to the faction standing letter in issue 90.  There is one additional "con" category above warmly - "kindly".  So, the standings in order are:  kindly, warmly, amiably, indifferently, apprehensively, dubiously, threateningly, and ready to attack.  Hope this helps, and may everyone view you kindly! (Except maybe those nasty orcs and gnolls.)
<br>
Alshanna
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the list of how you can be judged, it seems the fine bards left out one..here would be the complete list..warmly, kindly, amiably, indifferently, apprehensively, dubiously, threateningly, and finally scowls - ready to attack.  Hope I could be of a bit of help!
<br>
Igtenos D'Biathe
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you all for responding on this one as well.  Luckily bards don't have to have perfect knowledge as, usually, a nice voice and a little charm will go a long way toward a  place to sleep and a warm dinner.   The opinions above are two to one that kindly comes before warmly, but either seems pretty nice.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of clarifications: Dough = flour + milk + snake egg in a mixing bowl
<br><br>
Also the /con list has "kindly" between amiably and warmly.
<br>
Jaena of Qeynos, Brell Serilis
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a Question but a few bits of information on questions other people have asked.
<br><br>
Clumps o' dough/Pies: Clumps of dough MUST be made in a mixing bowl. They require: 1 flour; 1 Milk; 1 Snake egg. They are trivial at about 17 skill
<br><br>
Pies: Pies Must be made in an Oven or spit. Most of the recipes in books are wrong. The correct recipe is clump of dough + Ingredient (like berries) + a Pie Tin. The exception is beetle eye pie - which requires that spices be added to the mix. Pies are not trivial until 142 skill- they are the most difficult recipe currently known.
<br><br>
Quivers: Work as stated. However for some reason Backpacks serve the same function; if you have stacks of matching arrows in a backpack it will auto-feed just like a quiver. This makes quivers less useful than normal backpacks until Verant modifies their function.
<br>
Endanger Journeyman Ranger of Surefall Glade in the Service of Karana  Master Brewer, Master Baker, Master Smith, Master Potter, Apprentice tailor and Journeyman Fletcher(Cazic Thule Server)
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to you for your multiple responses to multiple questions and your insights into their workings.  It's great to have you write in!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a nice try, but about two months ago, a patch implemented the "autoload" effect from backpacks as well as quivers, so quivers are, alas, useless indeed (given that the backpack is the standard container of all players).
<br>
Naab
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Darn, well you're right.  ---- we all did try.   For now "quiver" will have to be useful as a word for descriptive emotes or some such as, for now, the named object seems to lack a distinctive function.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just some random mullings on the Q&A.
<br><br>
1) Quivers and arrows:  You do not need a quiver to have more than 20 arrows "effectively" available in your ammo slot.  I have had arrows stored in large bags that would feed to my bow when my ammo slot was down to one.  I assume any container would do the same.  Not sure, but this might be a bug, as it seems to make quivers useless.
<br><br>
2) Concerning faction and KOS:  While most monsters will only attack you if they look upon you threateningly or lower, I have been attacked by something that regarded me indifferent - my Dark Elf and a Sand Giant.  Needless to say, I was surprised.  I don't know if this is specific to Giants (or DE and Giants) but it's possible that other monsters and races may attack on sight though you con as indifferent.  You have been warned.
<br><br>
3) On the expansion - People who do not own the expansion will still be able to see the new race and use the new items, but they won't be able to travel to the new continent.  The expansion does offer an enhanced grapics engine, but the new grapics will only be available in the new land.  Thus, users with the expansion will not see any new grapics when in the current realm, but will when in the new one. Umm..deleted them all
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the comments on factions.  It is my understanding that with the con of "indifferent" there is at least a small percentage chance that the monster might decide they don't like you after all and attack you.  This is not just specific to Giants or DE and Giants as far as I know and the warning you give should be heeded by all who wish to avoid those unnecessary and oh so messy deaths.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a little bit of information on the question asking about switching servers. A little over a month ago someone from Verant stated that they were adding a quest to the game allowing you to change servers, however this would be a VERY difficult quest to prevent people from doing it often.
<br>
Azera
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen a lot of rumors posted of such a quest being in the works (and bards learn early on to "never say never"), but to date the only official word I have heard is that that players will not be allowed to move a character from one server to another.  The beauty of a dynamic game, however, is that ideas and technology do change and the game can always take advantage of the possibilities as time goes on.  In the meantime, I'm not holding my breath as I've heard that my face goes purple and is exceedingly unfashionable if I do.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an 'excerpt' from EQ website, that I saw in issue 90 Q&A about exploits.
<br><br>
"An exploit provides advantage for one or more players with the intention of profiting from them in some manner."
<br><br>
Now, think about it.... lets take.... the spell Spirit of Wolf as an example.....
<br><br>
'...provides advantage for one or more players..."
<br><br>
Yes, SoW is an advantage, it makes you run faster.
<br><br>
'...with the intention of profiting from them in some manner."
<br><br>
Say you're in Unrest, and you are a level 15 Monk (As I am).  You see this big huge train of festering hags, carrion ghouls, werebats, and the like.  Say the werebat and carrion ghoul decides to attack you.  With SoW I would get my a** in high gear and run towards the zone line. Therefore, I 'benefitted' from the SoW spell, by not dying.  I think EverQuest made a blunder :)
<br><br>
This is my rant for the week.  *smiles then laughs*
<br>
Aalon
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok a broad bard wink for you and then   . . . . picky, picky, picky.  It's a good thing we don't have a lawyer class because you'd be close to level 50 already!  (Joking!)   'Tis true I didn't quote  the entire explanation of exploits, but just to be clear, you might want to go to the official Everquest website and under the Support section and Guide section, read the information on exploits there.  It seems to me we need to realize that there are  distinctions between tactics and exploits.   Tactics make use of the game features its true -- SOW has saved many a life.  But exploits are a different mindset altogether, one closely aligned with cheating in my humble opinion.  At one time beta players claimed that running a hill giant into the entrance to Befallen was a tactic and wasn't an exploit because they were at risk while the giant chased them to the tunnel even though he would get stuck once he arrived.   However, the tactic wouldn't have worked without the technical  geometry problems inherent in the game which created a sticking place for the giants.  The situation created a vehement discussion for awhile and eventually the tactic was labeled as an exploit.  Thus, regardless of the conclusions to which your logic may lead,  it's important to remember that once an activity has been defined as an exploit by Verant it should be acknowledged as such and not used.
<br><br><br>
Thanks to you all for your questions and responses.  I look forward to hearing more from you.
