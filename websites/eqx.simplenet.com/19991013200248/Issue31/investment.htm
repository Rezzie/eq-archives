On dark nights, such as this, when rain falls in heavy sheets from starless skies, and eerie gales rustle wet leaves on ancient trees, dark things begin to creep.  Wakened from summer dreaming, they scurry about in their underground burrows, and toy with dark thoughts and musings as awareness slowly returns.
<br><br>
	In one such burrow, deep beneath the earth, a boy sat.  Pent and trapped in a tiny cavern, he hugged his knees to his chest, as he had done now all his life, which had seen none of the eight summers that had past in its span.  The earth closed tight against his hunched body, a tiny chamber, in which he perfectly fitted, illuminated by a stream of glowing red liquid which ran past him to his left.  It cast strange shadows upon the smooth rock walls of the chamber, fey and glistening in appearance, but the boy paid them no heed.
<br><br>
	The climate of the chamber was humid, a clinging wetness which caused each breath to be drawn heavy and slow, and the air smelt of stagnation.  But the boy knew nothing of clear air, and the red stream which bore with it a temperate heat and caused the humidity to double - it all seemed as natural to him as could be.
<br><br>
	Indeed, trapped and confined, the boy was undisturbed.  But for one concern, he would have been content.  The boy knew he was trapped.
<br><br>
	Each day, for this was how he reckoned time, a fish would swim past in the red stream, a strange fish, evolved in tiny currents that sift through dark burrows of dark creatures, with bulging eyes and slimy skin.  It was the boy's only source of nourishment, but it sufficed; his naked body was thin, but not overly so.
<br><br>
	At this time, the boy had finished a meal of raw fish, and deposited the bones back into the red stream, where it was swept away down the tunnel through which the red stream flowed.  His black hair was damp, and plastered thick and long across his white face, neck, chest, and back, for it had grown eight years without trimming.  His eyes had grown accustomed to the light, and from habit, he peered constantly at the red stream, watching as tiny bubbles formed and burst, and ripples coursed through it.  One day, long ago, a loose rock had come through the boys chamber, spinning in the shallow depth of the  small red stream, but it had escaped the boy's desperate clutch; his reactions were slow and unpractised, especially when it was not time for a fish to swim by.
<br><br>
	So the rock had escaped, but it haunted the boys thoughts.  He watched the stream with a constant eye, wishing desperately for the strange stone to come back.  But it never did.
<br><br>
	The red light coursing from the stream remained unchanged.  The patterns it threw upon the wall reflected the movement of the stream, in places, and in others, the red simply cast a steady, unwavering light.  And in this environment, the boy spent his time watching, and spent his thought on reviewing the image of the escaped stone.
<br><br>
	But on this day, as he hugged his knees once more, something far more profound than a stone would float his way, and something far more dreadful.
<br><br>
	The sound of rushing water, echoing in the chamber, the same for all the boy's lonely days, held a constant pitch and volume.  So, when that volume changed, the boy's mind reeled.  When change has only once occurred, the slightest difference can send a mind into great panic and excitement.
<br><br>
	So it was that the boy's body squirmed in the chamber, and he put his head close to the stream, where it was splashed and glowed red.  He peered down the thin tunnel, which was no more than six inches above water and six inches below, and searched desperately for the cause of the rhythmic splashing that came from within.  A sharp bend in the tunnel about six feet down stopped the boy's chance of an early warning of what stranger intruded upon his domain, but he felt the echoes strength growing, and the volume of the splashes were becoming louder.
<br><br>
	His breathing increased in its depth, and his heart began to thump uncontrollably as he waited.  At last, a thing appeared.
<br><br>
	Its form was akin to the boys, with arms and legs, head, torso and belly, but different.  It's skin seemed green, although it was difficult to tell in red saturation, and it could have been no more than one foot in height.  It was exceptionally thin, so thin that its appendages looked too long to belong to it, and its face was gaunt, its nose was thin and pointy, its eyes were dark and cunning, and its head was bald and smooth.  Upon its back it carried a small sack, slung across its shoulders, and it clutched at the sack with one hand as it pulled itself along with the other and kicked with its feet, hunched into the tiny tunnel.
<br><br>
	Shortly, it appeared at the end of the tunnel, and stood before the wide-eyed boy in the stream.
<br><br>
	It looked up and smiled at the boy, although its eyes remained impassive, and bore into the child.  "Hello," it said, in a voice dripping with sarcastic patronism, although it meant nothing to our boy.  "You have grown well, my Loot."
<br><br>
	Then it jumped closer to the boy, who retreat with shock, slammed his body against the back of the chamber.  Blood began to seep between his plastered hair.
<br><br>
	The goblin-creature frowned.  "Do not damage yourself.  You've keep too well for too long to ruin yourself now."
<br><br>
	Then the creature smiled its false smile again.  "Please, do not be afraid.  I am your keeper!  Be well!"  Then it made soft crooning noises, although they sounded more like whimpers, in an effort to calm the frightened child.  The boy had never felt emotion, not since the stone, so the fear he felt was overwhelming.
<br><br>
	Still, the boy had no mind, not intelligent, not crazy, just absent, caused by a life of absolute seclusion, and the alien crooning of the goblin-creature soon had the desired effect.
<br><br>
	The goblin padded on wet feet onto the small piece of dry land unoccupied by the child's body, and grasped with tight fingers at a matted lock of the boy's hair.  He cried in pain as the goblin-creature yanked, and his head was pulled forcefully to be level with the creature's.  Then the thin, hard fingers began to stroke his head, and say soft noises once more.
<br><br>
	The boy was empty.  His soul had grown cold inside him when he was stolen from his cot by this dark creature eight years ago, and it longed, silently, for release.
<br><br>
	Now, the goblin was to take its reward from its investment.  It tightened its hands upon the sides of the child's head, pushed violently at his temples.  The boy screamed in pain, but the goblin held fey strength in its hands, and held tight.  The scream echoed about the chamber, mingled with the noise of the stream, and the goblin began to chant.
<br><br>
	Its song of dark magic was long and slow, and each horrible note caused the child's soul to loosen, to shiver and cry in pain within its body.  The volume of the goblin's song increased, its melody twisted and evil beyond imagining by any being of light, and its little body writhed in a hellish dance to the stuttered beat.  The child's screaming became lost in the goblin's voice, an under-harmony which lent form to the goblin's song and served to increase its power.
<br><br>
	And the soul of the boy tore itself from its earthly bonds as it sought freedom from the darkness, and threw itself heavenward.  The goblin-song grew faint and distant far below as it rose ever higher, and soon, the song became unheard.

<br><br>
	The soul had gained its freedom.
<br><br>
	But within the cave, the song went on, and the boy still screamed.  The pitch changed chord, grew higher, more desperate, and the volume rose to such a height that the red stream began to foam.
<br><br>
	And then, it was done.  The goblin lay immobile, its body wasted.  Dead.
<br><br>
	The boy stopped screaming.  His opened his eyes, screwed tight shut through the song's duration, and looked about, as if seeing the chamber for the first time.  Then he chuckled.  "This body suits me well," it said, and his voice was inflected with the strange goblin accent.
<br><br>
	The boy then reached for a segment of wall, at a place where it met the smooth floor, and began to poke and nudge at it.  After a short time, a small segment of rock, seamlessly integrated into the wall, fell away, and revealed a small compartment, within which lay a tiny scroll, scrawled upon by the goblin long ago, in a place where its magic was strong.
<br><br>
	In a voice not yet comfortable with longer vocal chords, it spoke a line in an ancient language from the scroll, and waited.  Within a minute, the roof of the cavern began to crack and break.  Shards and loose stones began to fall upon the child, but most of the debris was strangely not falling down into the chamber, but rising, pulling against itself and spilling into the land that lay far above.
<br><br>
	Soon, the roof had collapsed completely.  A thin shaft of perhaps thirty feet lay above the boy, and as soon as the spell had finished, he began to climb, back against one wall and feet against the opposite, until he gained freedom, laughing quietly all the while.
<br><br>
	In his human-child body, the goblin could walk freely amongst the people of light, and work its dark mischief without fear of discovery.  "Indeed," he chuckled, "the investment was well worth the reward."
