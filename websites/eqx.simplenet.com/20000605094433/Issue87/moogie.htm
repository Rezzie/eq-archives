<b><em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
One troll seems to like me alot but he always seems to attack things that I want to attack.  What shall I do about this.  He always seems to want to eat everything and leave nothing for me to sell.

<b>Dear Balla
<br><br>
Moog suggests you look at <a href="../Issue86/moogie.htm">my advice last week</a>, about one of my husbands and what I do to make him barsh what I want him to.

<b>Dear Moshump
<br><br>
You don't worry bout her!  If she can't take a lil luv tap den why you want her for a girlfriend anyways?
</b>

<em>Dear Aunti Moog,

Dear Leieli
 <br><br>
Dis kind of ting make Moog so mad!  Trolls be people too.  You go on being friends wit your troll and if your odder friends get mad, den just get your troll friend to barsh 'em.  Moog finds dis ends most arguments.
