<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahoy!  I was recently hunting the area the Dervish seemed to have camped in the Western Commonlands, and met a fellow enchanter.  This enchanter was a high elf-borne, but kept changing into a human, particularly at night.  I asked him why and he said for the human's exp bonus.  I had always kept my gnome illusion up til this point (in hindsight, I wish I was born a gnome, then if I needed a mount I could just charm a fire beetle and ride when my feet grew tired) and was wondering, does the human illusion give you the human's innate ability at learning from fights quickly?  Also, does this mean, that a human using another illusion loses this natural "defense?"  Thank you, and may your songs always be ones of joy and never of sorrow.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing to remember when switching to the illusion/enchantment of another race is that you will gain only the abilities of the race and the basic faction of that race.  Thus, if the high elf was turning into a human,  he could expect to gain any abilities of the human, but things like the experience charts would not be affected  and there wouldn't be much point in it.   I do understand the charm of those adorable little gnomes, however, and would love to see one perched on a fire beetle's back resting his tiny toes.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail fellow bard.  I have a question on the lvl 11 bard song, Cinda's Charismatic Carillon.  I just turned lvl 11, and I eagerly bought the new song, only to find no real use for it.  Does it work, if so, how much of an effect does it have.

<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Cinda's Charismatic Carillon does work.  What you will need to do is target the npc you wish to have some effect on and then start your song.   The music will raise your faction with 1 type of the faction carried by the mob.   I think you can expect the faction increase to be one level.   Reports from various Pillars of Wisdom seem to focus on using the song to increase your buying and selling power.  According to them, those little faction increases can help fill your purse quicker!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been looking for a long time for a complete guide to tailoring but can't find anything about making raw silk or cured silk armor or what you do with black wolf skins.   Could you tell me how to make both kinds of silk armor and what I can make with black wolf skins?   Also if there is a book in EQ that tells you how to make these things?  If so, where can I buy it?

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh thank goodness again for the Pillars of Wisdom.  I've been concentrating so hard on osmotic messages of "Get Nep a Dress", that I've neglected all other forms of fashion, including tailoring.  However, here's the word.  Adelrune says that the black wolf skins  are used in a high elf quest.  Darnalak says that you'll need spider silk to make swatches and a pattern to make silk armor and all of the above plus some dreadful beverage (?) called Heady Kiolo for the cured silk armor.  I think if you want a little reading material, it might be worth your while to get to know one of the inhabitants of Lesser Fay who has just the book you're been trying to order.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know --  is there any good to drinking beer, wine, etc, in Everquest?  
<br><br>
Facan
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, from a bardic point of view, wine flows with song, or is it the other way around?  Anyway, supposing you wished to enjoy the tavern social life, then a bit of imbibing -- and making sure the bard has enough coin to keep her whistle wet -- can be a delight indeed.    As for effects on your smiting, well warriors will find their strength and stamina going up with a few sips of wine for courage, but sadly, just about the time their arms are buffed up, their feet get entangled all to easily (they lose agility and dexterity).    Other than that, I can tell you that getting drunk is useful if you wish to gain motion sickness.   Hmmm, well at least that's what I got from it after a bit. 
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a tech question.  Recently I forgot to put the EQ disk in when I went to play EQ but it worked without it so do I need to have the disk in to play it?   I have a another question -- how do I retrieve my screenshots because I have a lot of the "experienced gained" ones.   In EQ Vol 114, you stated that a necro should use a pet as "The pet will only take about 1% of the exp.   This is true...but to correct you...this is only true while in a GROUP, pets take a rather large amount of exp while the owner is going solo as stated by a Verant rep awhile ago. (Gorgan I think)  Also you told someone to find out who the "Dark Bargainers" are in Neriak, as that will help them find out how to raise faction with them.  I believe the "Dark Bargainers" are the merchants of Neriak.  Hope this helps you.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, sadly, I'm not a techie but you know what, I play EQ just fine without a cd in my computer so my guess is that once it is installed, you're all set and don't need to leave the cd in.   As for the screenshots, I usually go into my EQ folder and find the EQ000#.bmp files (well that's a close approximation) and double click on the file and the picture pops up.  It's like magic!   Well, for me it is because I have no idea why it works so easily but am truly glad it does.  Thanks for the information on the necro pet experience and the Dark Bargainers.  I appreciate you writing!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two questions actually.  First I am an Erudite wizard of the 15 level and no matter what I kill my exp does not seem to increase. I have leveled countless enemies, i.e., Derv camps, for countless hours.  My friend, an Erudite wizard of the same level, gets more exp than me also when he fights and when we group he still gets more.  This is frustrating me greatly as I have notced I lose more exp than the people I know when I die on EQ also. Does this happen to anyone else or is something not right. (I have asked a guide about it but they ignored me enough that I gave up).   Also, how do you build faction with ogres and trolls if you are a good race. I have tried to find out for a long time but I'm not getting anywhere.   I am friends with every other race, even dark elf. <br> Thank you for your time, sighned,
<br><br>
Talv, Erudite Wizard

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa, all these questions that call on expertise I don't really have.  However, I did talk to the Pillar of Wisdom, Adelrune, who said that chances are you are actually getting the same numbers in experience as your friend who is the same level, race and class but that you are experiencing graphical issues with the little experience bar being not entirely accurate.   As far as getting your experience, it's important to always use /con on monsters as even monsters of the same race/class may actually con differently even as they appear the same.  Also, it is true that one "blue" monster will give you different experience than another "blue" mob.  Usually, if I feel like I'm stuck and not making progress, I check around and try to find spots that are recommended for good experience rather than just sticking with where I am.   What you might want to do, if you ascertain that you are indeed doing much worse with experience than your friend, is to write to eqtech@verant.com and send them a list of your hardware to see if they could figure out any reason for the disparity in experience.   Some guides are tech wizzies and can help you troubleshoot, but many are not, so it's best to take questions like this directly to Verant to try to get some help.  Okies, moving on to the faction question.  Unless you are already "dubious" to good races and can enter the troll or ogre cities to do newbie quests there, my Pillars of Wisdom say that there really isn't a way to increase your faction with the trolls and ogres.    Besides, if you made friends with a troll, you might get something like cooties -- or worse!  Shiver!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am druid follower of Tunare.  I have noticed during my visits to Qeynos that I am poorly received by any member of the Order of Three.  All of the human wizards, mages, and enchanters in Qeynos regard me dubiously.  I have not yet found any way to improve my standing with them and wonder if it is even worth trying.  Your help is appreciated! :)

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't say if you are a wood elf or a half elf, but if you are either of those, chances are the Order of Three mages object to your race and thus eye you dubiously.  It could also possibly be a religion faction issue as the Order of Three may not see the beauty of Tunare the way you do.  If race is the problem, there probably isn't any way to raise your faction with them.  However, as far as I can figure out, your relationship to the Order of Three is not a major issue so spending way too much time trying to get to be friends is probably not the most fun use of your days in Norrath.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question really.  Or at all.  :)   A possible answer to the "hustle and bustle" sounds in taverns. Try turning up the "sound realism"  option (under "General" options, I believe).   It'll also let you hear some other nice ambient sounds when next to certain places/NPCs (guard footsteps, batwings flapping, etc.).

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing.  I haven't tried this yet to see but I will.  I always appreciate the help of fellow bards!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't a question, but a clarification of Jhenik's question (And your answer).  One of the things that amazes me the most is that nobody seems to know about the 1st level Necromancer pets. I'll spend my time traveling about, and hear people shout that the first Necro pet is at level 4. It's surprising how many people don't know about the level 1 necro pet, yet the spell is right there with the rest of the spells. (Even Necr's seem to lack in knowing this.)  Not only is this spell great for the newborn Necro, it also only costs 1 bone chip (after that they all cost 2).  Moving on... I'm not sure if this would be considered a 'spoiler' or not, but I've heard about a few Deathfist Orcs in East Commons that pose quite a challenge from roughly levels 7 to 10. (7-9 may want a group.)

This is a short one but I hope you find the Q&A helpful.  I always enjoy hearing from you whether it be questions or answers or both.  Thanks for writing.
