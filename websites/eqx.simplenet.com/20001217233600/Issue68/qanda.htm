<B>Please Note:</B> EverQuest Express is not the official voice of Verant
Interactive, makers of EverQuest.  We cannot answer questions about payment 
methods, hardware requirements (i.e. video cards), or technical details about 
the game.  This Q&A is meant to cover gameplay issues only.  Thank you for 
understanding.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you really get drunk? Does it really blur your screen?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You really can get drunk in EverQuest, which has many effects on your character.  Experiment with an armful of alcohol and see what fun you can have.  Please do not try this at home.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to master a trade skill without have to pay money to raise the skill?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, your trade skills will increase through use.  You are not required to pay a trainer for increases.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you create your own hotbuttons? I want to have one with the "/loc" command. 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is done from the Socials menu.  Right-click on one of the small social buttons, and it should give you a screen to create your own button. 

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you safe from encounters when you log off for the day (camp)? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, while you are logged off nothing can happen to your character.  The only exception is if you are linkdead.  In that case, your character will remain in the game, under computer control, and strange things can happen to you during this time.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How does safefall work and when does it work?  I only ask because I believe that my repeated attempts to test the skill have served only to make me seem suicidal.  I think I'm also getting shorter.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Safefall is checked any time you fall from a height that you would otherwise take damage from.  To increase your skill, you should find a place that you can jump from and take minimal amounts of damage.  As your skill increases, you will notice that you no longer take damage from this height, and you will need to practice from even higher.  Rumor has it that a master in safefall can even traverse Kelethin without fear of slipping off a platform.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I found an item that is magical (it's written when I inspect it). How do I identify it? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no identification of items and effects in that manner.  In general, if you find a magical item, its effect will be listed when you inspect it.  Magical weapons may have no effect other than being magical, which means they can damage monsters who are immune to non-magical attacks.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Offense skill?  I see it increasing as I fight, but I cannot find any information about it.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Offense is a general skill that is used for every weapon type to determine your chance to hit.  Other stats and skills further modify this chance as well.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a paladin. How do I lay on hands?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills that you start with, as well as new skills that you train the basics in, need to be set to a button so that you can use them.  To do this, go to the Abilities or Combat menu and right-click one of the skill buttons.  This will allow you to select one of your available skills for that button.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do bows and crossbows work? Can you manually aim, or do you just target it and leave it up to your archery skill?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>After equipping a bow, you target a monster and click on your long range weapon.  There is no manual aiming involved, other than pointing yourself in the general direction and being close enough for your particular bow and arrow combination to hit.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I found a quest that doesn't seem to be working. Is it going to be fixed, and how will I know when it is?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned in the news when you start the game, information about broken quests should be e-mailed to questhelp@verant.com.  To find out if the quest is working, you can either try it and see (for simple, low cost quests) or /petition and ask a guide.
