Hello Absor.
<br><br>
I was writing to you about a futuristic online rpg. Then i read the article
about etiquett and wanted to give my opinion in the matter.
as i write earlier i´m not playing everquest but i play pen and paper rpg´s.
So i picture myself in the same shoes as you but in an paper and pen rpg. If
i come to place were i see that an person is fighting with a monster and
he´s really hurt, fighting for hes or hers life then i would jump into the
fight and try to rescue the person.  I would do same in real life. So my
point is that if i played EQ (that should be an online rpg) i would see an
person in need i would help him.

We want Neren, we want Neren!! (well maybe just me)
<br><br>
I have been reading all the Neren storys as they come out, but hanv't seen 
one in like 3 weeks.   They are all very good and I love to see how a newbie 
comes up in the world :).  Also I want to know what happens in the war, and 
like how they talk about the other races and how will they help.

P.S. I wouldn't mind having all those mystic jewels that Neren's father left 
him :)

Dear EverQuest Express,
<br><br>
I write to you as a concerned roleplayer. I don't want to complain about
Verant and the GMs after all they've gone through to make the game playable,
but the most recent GM event on Rallos Zek has thrown quite a monkey wrench
into the plans of the people down here at the Straylight Saga, the most
well-known roleplayer group on the infamous Rallos Zek server. We have been
carefully crafting a storyline involving a child said to be the daughter of
Innoruuk, and have been preparing for a major event that will attempt to
summon Innoruuk into the world of Norrath for an hour or so.
<br><br>
Verant has said it wants to foster roleplaying, yet suddenly here comes a
Teir'dal claiming to be the daugher of Innoruuk, giving a quest that can
only be fulfilled by powergamers (since it involves killing high-level
spawns, and 95% of our members are below level 30). Also, I've spoken with a
GM, and the chances of actually getting Innoruuk to appear at the
aforementioned ceremony is very slim. Even on other servers, the most
prevalent GM events involve them hopping into high-level MOBs and causing
havoc. Some roleplaying, eh?
<br><br>
If Verant wants to foster roleplaying so much, then why do they give events
that cater to powergamers and ignore these wonderful, legitimate roleplaying
storylines?

<em>[Ed. - I wasn't going to include this letter because it really doesn't do enough to 
explain what's going on.  I've heard rumors about this, and that's all.  But I get a 
bit concerned when someone is more concerned about the 'script' of their roleplaying 
than they are with the evolution of the characters.  I'm not condoning whatever it was that happened.  But I would like to think that a real roleplayer is not interested in a script, that's what actors are for...
<br><br>
And...  Ambiguous Slayers?  I'm not going to get started on that...]
