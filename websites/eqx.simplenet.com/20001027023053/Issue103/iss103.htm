Ivar picked up the small, retractable telescope. It quivered in his hand 
slightly as he held it to his eye. "This is almost as ingenious as your 
underwater breathing apparatus, Pinter."
<br><br>
"Aye the greatest friend of a hermit is his mind." Pinter shifted his feet back and forth methodically.

Silak drew his cowl up above his face in an attempt to keep out the chill that was seeping into his bones. He looked to the moon in the sky to gauge the time. The time was growing nearer. Silak yawned, the chill making him sluggish. In doing so he revealed row after row of sharp pointed teeth made for tearing flesh to shreds. A sickly pink tongue rolled out of his mouth and down his chin. The moonlight shimmered off the green scales covering his face.

The leaden tones of the Head Judicator resounded strangely throughout the field of bone, amplified to an otherworldly level by the hollow bones of the first children of Veeshan, their spirits passed from the world ages ago.  A faint glimmer of hope flashed across the warrior's features, only to be extinguished by the somber faces of the High Council members.

    I will not ever forget my very first visit to Kunark. During the winter, on a rainy night on Freeport, my good friend Garadeb, whom I had presumed dead, returned to Antonica and wanted me to come with him on a trip to Kunark. At the time, I did not believe him, because Kunark was a legend among the people of Norrath for seemingly hundreds of years, and the thought of a voyage to a place only heard about from childhood bedtime stories was just too much to comprehend. But I could not give up the chance of a lifetime.

I was brought up on myths.  At the risk of setting off some kind of warning signs to teachers with a distinctly Christian agenda, when I was a kid I think the reason I stopped believing in God had to do with myths we were taught in school.

"Mrs. Smith," yes, that was the teacher's name in 4th grade, "So Prometheus really gave fire to man?"

Ziff ripped the quiram root from the ground with his knife. He had spent the better part of the day looking for it, and he was pleased with the abundant growth of it here. Quiram was a necessary component for the Charm spell, and if he wanted to practice the new spell, he needed as much quiram as he could find.

By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young girl calling,<br>

For you stole Sir Lucan's corn,<br>
So our son might see the morn.<br>
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay."

Hi Absor,
 <br><br>
I was reading through the Question and answer section, and someone requested a search engine to be able to search through your website. I am the webmaster for www.pacificcable.com. we have a search engine on our site. It is a free search engine that is really easy to implement. There is some advertising on the search engine page - that is why it is free. <br><br>
