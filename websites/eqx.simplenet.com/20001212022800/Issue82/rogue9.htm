<b>Part Nine</b>


<br><br>

   Daryth disappeared once again in the fall of that year.  One day, he was just gone, and Katha wore the same half worried half annoyed expression that Kinory had grown to know.   Rumors flew that he and Teron had had an argument the night that Daryth had left.  Teron, usually a gregarious and affable man, stayed holed up in his offices, speaking to no one.  Galern smirked his way around the halls, gathering his friends and supporters around him.  A schism between the leader and his trusted second hand was a golden opportunity for the ambitious Dwarf, and he waited eagerly for the moment to make a move.  Katha took to sleeping on the couch outside Teron's offices.  Kinory kept a low profile, looked to Katha for guidance, and worried to herself. She wasn't subtle enough to catch all the nuances, but everyone knew that Galern was power-hungry.  Everyone but Teron, who bodily threw Katha out the one time she tried to discuss it with him.  With any other man under the sun, she would have fed him the first finger he laid on her, but it was Teron, who had built the Rogue's Guild from a pack of snarling gutter-dogs into a stronghold and a family.
   <br><br>
Katha swallowed her ire and went away, praying for Daryth's quick return. 
<br><br>
   Daryth's absence stretched into months, and Galern, sure that this time his rival would not be coming back, made his move.  Teron fell ill.  
<br><br>
   Katha ransacked the kitchens, tasted Teron's food herself, then took to preparing it herself when he got no better.  Nothing changed.  Teron got weaker, began coughing up blood, and then took to his bed and did not leave it.  Until the day that Daryth came striding through the main door of the Guild, healthy and very much alive.  
<br><br>
   Katha met him at the entrance to Teron's offices, flung her arms about his neck, and then drew him inside.  They were in there for less than an hour, with Kinory sitting outside, trying desperately to look nonchalant and not as if she was on guard duty.  When they came out, they were grim faced, and Daryth looked five years older than when he had entered.
<br><br>
   "Kinory," said Katha, her expression strained, but holding more hope than it had in weeks.  "Call the Council.  We are having a meeting."
<br><br>
   Kinory leapt to her feet, but was halted by appearance of one of Galern's cronies, a Halfling named Kash.  He surveyed them with a curl of his upper lip, and then announced in a ringing voice, "Galern calls a session of the council.  Your presences are required."  He turned on his heel and left.  Katha cursed softly.
<br><br>
   "Have I come in time, Katha?" said Daryth, his voice low and harsh with self-recrimination.
<br><br>
   "The gods only know," answered the lithe assassin, and she drew a hand across her eyes.
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   Daryth stared across the desk at Teron.  He kept his face still, but inside he felt sick and cold.  His leader and friend looked like an old, old man.  He looked withered and fragile, like a dead leaf about to blow away in the wind.    The leader of the Freeport Rogues slumped in the chair at the head of the long Council table and watched the proceedings silently.  Daryth cursed himself.  He should never have gone away.  There was no way that Teron was ill.  Someone was doing this to him, and very cleverly, too, if they had not been caught at it.  Katha was beyond vigilant when it came to protecting Teron.  Daryth smelt an ambitious Dwarf in this.  
<br><br>
   Katha rose to her feet, and opened her mouth.  The Dwarf beat her to the punch, leaping up onto his chair, as was his wont, to increase his height and therefore the impact of his words.
<br><br>
   "Your pardon, Katha, but I have news of a major blood job, and according to our guild laws, it must be dealt with first.
<br><br>
   "My friends," said Galern.  "It has come to my attention that our guild has been approached by certain parties interested in our services.  Antonius Bayle is making a state visit to Freeport in a month.  Someone would like to see him dead.  Normally, of course, whichever guild member had been approached would be the one to get the assignment, but in this case, I would like to propose a specific person."  He smiled at Daryth.  "Since she did not take the Tests on entrance, some of us have felt that she is not truly a part of our family.  This would be an opportunity to rectify that lack, and silence those who doubt her, shall we say, true devotion." He turned back to the assembly.  "I propose Kinory be the one to take this job."
<br><br>
   The Council broke into loud muttering and some stared in open disbelief at the Dwarf.  Daryth's jaw dropped.  He had been ready for anything but this.  He cursed himself for ten kinds of fool.  Galern never forgot anything.  He covered his eyes.  He had been so sure she was safe.  Teron sank lower in his chair, closing his eyes.
<br><br>
   "Are you jesting, Galern?" said Katha loudly.  "The girl is a thief, not an assassin.  The idea is ridiculous!"   Loud shouts of agreement came from all sides.  Galern held up his hands.
<br><br>
   "The matter has been brought up in open session!  It must now be put to a vote, by Guild law."
<br><br>
   "Let us vote, then, and move on to more important matters," said Katha in disgust.  "You cannot believe it will pass, Galern," she hissed at him in an undertone.  The Dwarf did not reply.  He merely smiled at Daryth again, victoriously.  Daryth looked at Katha in despair, and watched her face change as she realized.  
<br><br>
   The vote passed, 8 to 7.
<br><br>

    "Me?" asked Kinory, shocked and dismayed.   "I'm not an assassin, I've never even shown the slightest inclination towards it.  Why me?"
<br><br>
   "You were chosen because I angered some particularly vengeful people on the Council, that's why," said Daryth.  He stood abruptly, and paced around his chair.  Kinory's eyes followed him.
<br><br>
   "<em>You</em> angered…?" she asked bewilderedly.  "I can't do a blood job.  I'm a thief, nothing more."
<br><br>
   "My gods, such an innocent still," said Daryth, looking back at her.  "They know that.  But you are my protegee.  They are sending you out on this job to fail, my sweet fool.  And when you fail, you will be tried as a guild traitor.  It has happened before, and Teron is too old and…<em>ill</em>…to protect us."  He rubbed his eyes and sighed.   "Two things can happen.  Either you are tried and convicted, and I lose face before the Council, or I step in to defend you and we are both brought down together.  In either case, I am doomed.  Galorn is a sneaky little bastard."  He shook his head in rueful admiration.
<br><br>
   "What… what if I don't fail," faltered Kinory.
<br><br>
   "What are you talking about?  You have never had any training in this.  It is not as easy as pilfering a pretty.  To consciously, cold-bloodedly take another life?  You don't have it in you, Kinory.  Don't fool yourself."
<br><br>
   "What are my options?" she said calmly.  "To refuse the assignment is the same as failing in it. Either way, I am brought up on the same charges.  I must at least try.  Where's Katha?"  Kinory stood.
<br><br>
   "She can't train you in a month."  He slumped back into the chair.  Kinory came over and planted her hands on the arms of his chair, staring him in the eye.
<br><br>
   "You can lay down and die without a murmur, if that's what you want.  I am not giving up that easily.  Where is Kat?"
<br><br>
   He looked at her with surprise, and then laughed aloud.  Kinory saw in his face, at last, the admiration and respect that she had longed for all the years she had known him.
<br><br>
   "In the training grounds, with the new initiates."  Kinory straightened and headed for the door.  "Tell her I said I take it back."  She turned and gave him a quizzical look.  "There is steel in you, after all."   A small enigmatic smile lurked on his lips.  She grinned back, and left.
<br><br>

   <p style="text-align: justify">
   Katha was putting the trainees through the ladders when Kinory found her.  The slim half-elf turned as Kinory closed the heavy door.  Her face told Kinory that she'd heard.
<br><br>
   "Kinny, I'm sorry.  I voted against it.  I told them it was murder, no less."  Kinory shook her head.
<br><br>
   "Done is done, Kat.  I need your help.  I need you to be my teacher."
<br><br>
   "You can't learn a Craft in only a month, Kinory," she began.  Kinory cut her off.
<br><br>
   "I've already had the lecture from Daryth.  I don't have the time to argue with you.  Please?"
<br><br>
   Katha bit her lower lip in indecision, and then nodded. 
<br><br>
   "All right, that's it for today," Kat called, and the sweating, struggling youngsters dropped to the ground.  Kinory watched them file by her, each giving a bow to her and the assassin.  Had she ever been that young?  She looked at her hands, small and refined, the fingertips as soft and smooth as a babe's skin.  
<br><br>
   "We'll start with the dagger, I suppose," said Katha.  "You'll want to keep it simple.  You won't have much time, if any, alone with the target.  No point in getting fancy."  She led the way into the target range, and with a flick of her fingers, produced a knife, seemingly from thin air.  "This is a thul'ka, the smaller and lighter of the two throwing blades.  You'll likely carry these.  They're easily concealed, and can be as effective, if not more so, than the larger, if the user has good aim."
<br><br>
   Kinory listened intently.  She had come a long way from the young, naïve girl she had been when she had ignorantly followed Daryth away from Kelethin.  This would be just another step on that path.  So she told herself.  Weighing the small blade in her hand, she put its true use from her mind, and concentrated on the target at the end of the range.
