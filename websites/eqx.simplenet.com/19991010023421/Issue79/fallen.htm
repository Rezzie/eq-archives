<p style="text-align: justify">



Beneath Befallen's putrid mound<br>
Amidst the boulder'd tombs<br>
Where undead creatures slink and moan<br>
A treasure may be found
<br><br>
Yet seek ye not this thing of lore<br>
Until your blood is warmed<br>
For finding it shall test thee true<br>
And lead through thrice locked doors
<br><br>
Just gathering the mystic keys<br>
Shall prove your life is dear<br>
For foul rats and skeletons black<br>
Mere fodder do appear 
<br><br>
Past scores of ghouls and wisps descend<br>
Amidst the necromancers whims<br>
Delve deeper if you seek to own<br>
A claymore sword of bladed bone
<br><br>
And Borgon did since just thirteen<br>
A Northern stalwart bred on dreams<br>
Of how with sinew strong and lean<br>
He'd wrest it from the undead fiends
<br><br>
And yes, tis true I ventured too<br>
With friends both bold and true<br>
Fore t'was the getting, not the having<br>
Which made the beasties stew
<br><br>
Shadow Knights did bar the way<br>
At many a crucial turn<br>
And besting them was our first test<br>
Of mettle yet unused
<br><br>
An undead elf did seek our death<br>
Down within the deepest depths<br>
A vile guardian sent to purge<br>
Those who trod the secret steps
<br><br>
So none shall grasp the bon'ed blade<br>
One wall hides well the fabled cave<br>
Yet seek it still with blinded eye<br>
Both hand by hand and foot by foot
<br><br>
But finding it won't end the task<br>
Still greater things this sword does ask<br>
For in it's darkened chamber hiding<br>
Greater fears are still abiding
<br><br>
Past the throne of tortured past<br>
All round about are beings of night<br>
And besting them we near the nest<br>
Where lays the sword of Borgon's quest
<br><br>
But lo, the crypt is even empty<br>
Have others gained the prize afore we<br>
Wait a brightening all engulfing<br>
Brings forth the keepers final army
<br><br>
Strike and parry, cast and wheel<br>
Knight of Darkness aided fully<br>
Undead minions feel our wrath<br>
We shall have your ward at last
<br><br>
And now we stand and cheer aloud<br>
As Borgon grasps the storied sword<br>
Evil beings your fate is sealed<br>
A righteous man this blade does wield
<br><br>
Befallen may be bested true<br>
Yet only venture there forewarned<br>
Take those you trust who trust in you<br>
Or call Befallen home
