<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>An 
  Old Friend</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Oghma!&#148; 
  Posy almost shouted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Posy, my 
  friend, how are you!&#148; Oghma replied, smiling. He waved from the path.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Oh, Oghma, 
  I&#146;ve been banished from the Wizard&#146;s Guild! It&#146;s horrible!&#148; 
  Posy burst into tears. It was such a relief to see her good friend Oghma&#146;s 
  friendly face! All the past week&#146;s events, and her resolve to not show 
  anyone how hurt she was, tumbled out of her in a rush, and she was unable to 
  restrain herself anymore. She raced down the hill, threw herself into his arms 
  and sobbed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;That&#146;s 
  ok, Posy,&#148; Oghma said kindly, &#147;you just go ahead and cry a while.&#148; 
  They stood together for several minutes, the small gnome girl enveloped in the 
  brawny arms of the dwarf, her petite frame racked with the weight of her distress 
  and frustration. Oghma murmured soothing words and patted her shoulder comfortingly. 
  The occasional traveler would walk past and give Oghma a questioning look, and 
  Oghma smiled at them reassuringly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally Posy stepped 
  back, her face blotchy and tear-stained. She sniffled. She almost wiped her 
  nose on her yellow guild robe, but Oghma handed her a handkerchief before she 
  could.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;So, now, 
  Posy, tell me what happened. I assume it wasn&#146;t because of a failure in 
  your class work, because I know you are a talented wizard!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy nodded, wiping 
  her face with the handkerchief. &#147;No, that wasn&#146;t it - I do well with 
  classes and the actual training.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma nodded. &#147;Now 
  I did hear a tale about a little gnome wizard who replaced the standard bat 
  wing component for Levitate with something a bit different?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy giggled through 
  her tear-stained cheeks. &#147;I didn&#146;t know that it would turn them upside 
  down! I thought it would make them float longer!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma grinned. 
  &#147;I imagine that the classroom looked like an odd collection of tents with 
  knobby-kneed tent poles!&#148; Oghma laughed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy laughed out 
  loud. &#147;It did! And they floated around bouncing into each other, like a 
  dance festival with too much gnomish spirits in the punch!&#148; She smiled. 
  Tobon, the wizard Guildmaster, had reprimanded her for that, but there was a 
  hint of a smile in his stern face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma pressed on. 
  &#147;How about a certain wizardly tinkering experiment with firewater and a 
  large metal tube?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy smiled, feeling 
  a bit better already. &#147;That one wasn&#146;t my fault!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma looked at 
  her steadily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Oh, alright, 
  it <b>was</b> my idea. I just thought that if fireworks could be launched out 
  of a small tube, that a BIG tube would be able to launch a whole person! It 
  did work, too!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma laughed. 
  &#145;What did you do? I never heard the whole story&#133;&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Oh, we made 
  a lot of firewater and put it on a big chamber at the bottom of the tube. My 
  friend Millenthorpe stood in the tube and I created a shock of fire to ignite 
  it.&#148; She giggled. &#147;He did fly! It worked!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;&#148;How 
  far did he go?&#148; Oghma laughed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Well, he 
  flew from the Ak&#146;anon entrance to the skull of the old plague dragon. There 
  was a sharp-eyed wizard who saw him flying in, and cast Levitate on him before 
  he landed. He was all right, but a bit blackened.&#148; Posy said defensively, 
  &#147;He had great fun, he said!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma grinned. 
  &#147;I&#146;m sure he did, but that was hardly the point, now, was it?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blushing, Posy 
  said, &#147;Tobon had me working for weeks in the library after that. He also 
  forbade me to tinker for a year.&#148; Posy smiled. &#147;I had fun in the library, 
  though! All that history, the stories, and the knowledge! I learned so much 
  just carrying books around - who the great authors were, what they did. I even 
  saw a small book by you, Oghma!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma chuckled. 
  &#147;Which one was that?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Flora and 
  Fauna of the Qeynos Hills region, it was. You talked all about wolves, snakes, 
  the Klaknak royalty, and a little about the Blackburrow Gnolls. I didn&#146;t 
  know you had traveled so much when I met you!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma smiled, &#147;I 
  don&#146;t think I had been there when we met. I traveled there while you were 
  studying.&#148; Oghma frowned. &#147;I do need to update my treatise on the 
  Gnolls though. A researcher named Nalixa did some earlier work after the Splitpaw 
  Gnolls were taken over, and I haven&#146;t seen&#133;&#148; He trailed off, 
  lost in thought, pondering the changes in the Gnoll culture. A minute or so 
  passed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Oghma?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma re-focused 
  with at start. &#147;Yes! Sorry! Why did you get banished from the guild? You 
  haven&#146;t told me yet.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy looked sad. 
  &#147;Well, I&#146;m not really sure, but I think that I made a spell with research 
  that they&#146;d never seen before. They&#146;re all upset about it. Mostly 
  I think they kicked me out because I embarrassed them.&#148; Posy sniffled. 
  &#147;I think Tobon still likes me, but I&#146;m a &#145;bad example&#146; for 
  the others.&#148; Posy&#146;s face began to fall, as if she was going to start 
  to cry again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma glanced at 
  her and said, &#147;Now, Posy - you are an original, that&#146;s for sure - 
  but never a bad example. I wish more people were like you, really.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Really?&#148; 
  Posy stifled a sniffle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Did you ever 
  hear the story of Fibtik the wolf-rider?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy shook her 
  head.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Fibtik 
  the Wolf-rider</b></i></font></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once upon a 
  time there was a gnome warrior named Fibtik. He was a brave warrior back in 
  the times when Ak&#146;anon was being built, when the Steamfont Mountains were 
  wild and untamed.</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy interrupted, 
  &#147;Was he part of Edril&#146;s band?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma looked at 
  her pointedly. &#147;Yes, I was just getting to that.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy bowed her 
  head meekly. &#147;Sorry, continue.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>He was part 
  of a band of gnomes, led by Edril, whose job it was to make the Steamfont Mountains 
  safe to live in. No one knew of the minotaurs who lived in caves along the eastern 
  ranges, and Meldrath had yet to come to inhabit them.</i></font></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Edril&#146;s 
  band was a very tight little group; they followed orders very well and were 
  highly disciplined - all except Fibtik. He would often roam alone after the 
  band had camped, and while the band was systematically clearing areas; Fibtik 
  would go back to previously cleared areas and run ahead to untouched areas that 
  weren&#146;t scheduled to be cleared. Edril always had to send someone to find 
  him, and he was often disciplined by Edril.</font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One day, he 
  roamed out to a new area and came across a band of minotaurs! They were gigantic 
  and smelly and he overheard them talking about Edril&#146;s band. It seems that 
  they had been watching from a nearby mountain and were planning on ambushing 
  them in less than an hour!</font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, Fibtik 
  couldn&#146;t let this happen, so he began to creep away from the minotaur camp. 
  Right at that moment he stepped on a twig, and the sensitive ears of the minotaurs 
  heard it. Suddenly the whole camp was in an uproar, and Fibtik found himself 
  chased by a furious band of 8-foot tall bovine monsters!</font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He was determined 
  not to lead them to the unprepared band of gnomes, so he ran into a cave in 
  a nearby mountain. Like many caves in the Steamfont range, it was actually a 
  warren of tunnels, meandering back in and out of the mountain&#146;s edge. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Racing through 
  the caves, he stumbled across a pack of wolves. Literally stumbling, too, the 
  minotaurs hot on his heels, he tripped and landed astride the pack leader, who, 
  being suddenly awakened from his nap, took off running.</font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fibtik squeezed 
  his legs together and hung on for dear life. The wolf ran outdoors, trying to 
  shake off the strange weight on his shoulders. Jumping, hopping, and running 
  flat out, the wolf soon ran straight through the gnome encampment, it&#146;s 
  howls rousing the resting gnomes. Edril&#146;s band, like clockwork, organized 
  themselves into a defensive front and slaughtered the band of minotaur when 
  they followed the wolf into the camp shortly thereafter.</font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fibtik became 
  a hero, and Edril used him as his scout from then on. The minotaurs retreated 
  to the caves, and it&#146;s said that Fibtik may have gone on to found the rogues 
  guild there in Ak&#146;anon. </font></i></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;So you see 
  Posy, sometimes people who march to a different drummer are destined for greater 
  things! Perhaps the great Brell has plans for you beyond your wildest imaginings.&#148; 
  Oghma smiled. &#147;You may wish, however, to curb your boisterous nature a 
  bit so as to cause less damage to those around you,&#148; he grinned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy felt better 
  than she had in a while. &#147;Oghma, I was on my way to Felwithe to go to the 
  Wizard Guild there. Do you think they can teach me higher magic?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma grunted. 
  &#147;I&#146;m sure they could, but the question is more - would they? The high 
  elves don&#146;t hold gnome magic in high esteem, especially since gnomes have 
  delved into the forbidden necromantic magic.&#148; He frowned. &#147;Another 
  thing that doesn&#146;t sit well with them is experimentation. They almost threw 
  my friend Mundas out of town, though that mishap had little to do with his spell 
  craft. He tends at times to be a bit wordy. Most high elves I know could use 
  a good dose of a sense of humor.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy looked worried. 
  &#147;What am I to do then? There are no other wizard guilds on this continent!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma smiled, &#147;I 
  guess that means you need to go to another continent. Perhaps Antonica beckons 
  you. Qeynos and Freeport both have very good wizards guilds. Freeport is where 
  the ships dock from the Butcherblock Mountains. You could go there!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Among the 
  humans?&#148; Posy looked doubtful. &#147;I hear they smell bad, and try to 
  step on us gnomes.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma chuckled. 
  &#147;No, they don&#146;t smell any better or worse than us, and some are quite 
  nice.&#148; Oghma paused. &#147;I have a friend I&#146;m meeting in Kelethin 
  later today, perhaps he&#146;s heading that way. He&#146;s human, and a nice 
  one. With him by your side you should have no worries.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma and Posy 
  broke camp and headed along the path to Kelethin. On the way, they passed the 
  Felwithe gates and Posy looked longingly at the high marble spires of the High 
  Elven city. Perhaps later, when she was a powerful mage in her own right, she 
  could return to Felwithe and be treated according to her due.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy had heard 
  of the tree city of Kelethin in stories, but was unprepared for the real thing. 
  Trotting along the path, she saw the giant trees of Kelethin, with their sturdy 
  wooden platforms arching over her head. The laughter and singing of the wood 
  elves lifted her heart, and the faces she saw seemed quite friendly. Several 
  of the handsome young wood elves gave teasing greetings that she hoped were 
  not meant as they sounded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Ho, dwarf! 
  Brought your own date? Are the ladies of Kelethin not to your liking?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Fair damsel, 
  truly, your friend needs a shave! You may want to wait though! You might not 
  like what you see when you look under the beard!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Oghma!&#148; 
  one shouted. &#147;You have brought me the woman of my dreams! A thousand thanks!&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy blushed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The festival 
  here is in full swing,&#148; Oghma chuckled. &#147;Don&#146;t mind their teasing. 
  At least they aren&#146;t as snooty as the High Elves of Felwithe.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Do they not 
  like gnomes too? Do all Elves hate gnomes?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Elves feel 
  close ties to nature. To them, nature is a companion, a guide, a friend. Gnomes 
  seem to feel that nature is something to be tamed or improved. Look, for example, 
  at the great waterwheels in Ak&#146;anon.&#148; Oghma paused. &#147;Can you 
  imagine elves building such a thing?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;But it provides 
  light and energy for all of Ak&#146;anon! It&#146;s good for the whole city!&#148; 
  Posy asserted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;In the eyes 
  of an Elf, the Gnomes have chained and sucked the life from their friend the 
  River. It&#146;s not to say that individual Gnomes aren&#146;t liked - Gnomes 
  and Elves have a long shared history battling the Orcs of Crushbone. I just 
  believe that Elves see Gnomes as cruel to nature, whereas Gnomes believe that 
  their clockwork creations are an improvement on nature.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Our cleaners 
  keep Ak&#146;anon clean, and our merchants and guards give us more time to pursue 
  what is important!&#148; Posy said defensively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;True, Posy 
  - but not all see it that way, and at times it may be better to not point out 
  our differences and instead celebrate the things that are shared. Only then 
  can we come to a more complete understanding of things.&#148; Oghma looked sad. 
  &#147;Dwarves are about the worst of all. We feel we work so hard to extract 
  the gifts of Brell from the earth and work them into wondrous items. Somehow, 
  to us that means that no other race can match our industriousness, and therefore 
  all others are lazy. Would you see such a festival in Kaladim? This festival 
  lasts over a fortnight. A dwarven festival is a serious thing, with much pride 
  and boasting, and over in two days else work would suffer. We feel we are so 
  self-sufficient, that we need not ask for aid from any other race.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Do dwarves 
  need help?&#148; Posy asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Every race 
  needs help against their enemies. Elves, Gnomes and Dwarves all battle Kobolds, 
  Goblins, Ogres and Orcs.&#148; Oghma looked grim. &#147;Ak&#146;anon must deal 
  with the crazed Meldrath and his minions.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma paused. &#147;What 
  if Meldrath enlisted the help of the Crushbone Orcs to fight the gnomes? Would 
  the elves come running to help?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy pondered these 
  new ideas as they approached a low platform near one of the largest trees. Oghma 
  gestured to her to stand on the platform, then lifted a wooden bar near it. 
  Posy heard the familiar sound of mechanicals. Suddenly, the platform rose into 
  the air and they were lifted to the tree city.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posy looked at 
  Oghma. Oghma shrugged. &#147;Built by gnomes,&#148; he grinned. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;My friend 
  is at the Heartwood Tavern,&#148; Oghma said. &#147;He came for the festival, 
  I believe he has a bard friend singing in one of the celebrations.&#148; They 
  strode across a swaying bridge and entered the tavern.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tavern was 
  filled with elves, drinking and singing. Posy looked through the gloom of the 
  tavern and spotted a lone human, who must have been the only one in the tavern 
  not drunk out of his mind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oghma walked over 
  to the table where the human sat, slowly sipping an Elven wine.<br>
  &#147;Cairbre, I&#146;d like you to meet my friend Posy,&#148; Oghma said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The human squatted 
  easily down to be at eye level with Posy. He was dressed in an armor Posy had 
  never seen before, steel-looking with gold trim. Though well kept, the armor 
  was dented and dinged with scratches and marks from countless battles. Kind 
  eyes smiled from a battle-hardened visage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Hello, young 
  Posy,&#148; Cairbre said. &#147;Pleased to meet you!&#148; He thoughtfully slid 
  a small step stool over to his booth, though you could tell that he winced slightly 
  with the motion. &#147;Would you like to sit with me?&#148;</font></p>
