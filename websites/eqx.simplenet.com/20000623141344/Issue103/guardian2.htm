<em>I have commanded the ocean to silence at its surface.  The dwellers of the land shall not hear her sing, you have lost that privilege.  But know that her heart still beats.  And as long as it does, as does mine, you shall never be allowed to spill your blood into her again.</em>
<br><br>
- attributed to Prexus himself in <em>The End of Days</em> - written by Shalu Windhammer, Elven bard of the Elder Age.

<br><br><br>
"Oh mighty Ocean Lord, we keep your law, we obey your word.  We take not from the sea, lest she take doubly from us.  And in asking this favor of you, we ask you to accept our humble offerings.  Each land dweller here gives to you something of great personal value.  With this small gesture we show our loyalty and respect for the seas, and for Prexus."
<br><br>
Galm leaned over to his brother Glind and tried to whisper, "I still can't believe yer goin' through with this.  That's our father's hammer yer gunna toss overboard!"  As usual, Galm's rusty voice carried, there wasn't a man or woman on the poop deck that didn't hear the Dwarf.  He fairly bristled with anger.  But as the younger brother, the Hammer of Garfnal was out of his control.  It was Glind's to do with as he pleased.  And Glind had been befuddled by Omonero, the Erudite priest of Prexus, into coming along on this suicide journey.  So Galm had insisted on coming along as well.  Forcing himself aboard the ship at the last moment, he figured that the least he could do would be to exact revenge for the loss of his brother and his father's hammer.  It wasn't until just then that he realized that he wouldn't be able to exact revenge if he was dead.  He swore an oath to his father at that moment: <em>Pops, no matter what, if I go, I'll take that self-righteous priest with me</em>.
<br><br>
He noticed, rather belatedly, that the ceremony had stopped, and everyone was looking at the two brothers with mixed expressions.  The sailors were mostly shaking their heads, as they were all Prexus worshippers of some devotion or other, and they obviously believed that this ceremony was the only way that they would reach their destination alive.  The other 'adventurers' were alternating between a similar head shake and an understanding, even sympathetic gaze.  Omonero, the priest, was looking at them patiently.
<br><br>
"It is the most precious thing that I own.  And I would gladly trade it for our all of our lives, and for the success of this very important journey.  I've explained this before, Galm.  Gaining the favor of the Ocean Lord is the only way to make it across the sea, and we must make it across."  Glind turned to face his younger brother.  His voice was melodic, especially compared with the gravely sounds that came from his brother's throat.  And, despite himself, Galm was struck emotionally when Glind told him, "I'm glad you're here."
<br><br>
Galm shook his head to clear it, and mentally cursed the circumstances of his birth.  The first born, Glind, had been accepted as a paladin with ease.  The second born had been relegated to the life of a mere warrior.  Glind had been gifted with all of the power and wealth of his father when he died.  Sure, Galm never went without something that he wanted.  Glind was very generous.  But it always nagged at him that nothing of his was really... his.  The older brother found it easy to discover love, too.  Not that Galm would ever want to marry a Half-Elf.  But Fealwin was beautiful, and brilliant.  Despite the fact that she was a Half-Elf, Glam was jealous.  What really irked Galm was that if <em>HE</em> had married outside of his race, he would have been driven from his home buy hundreds of Dwarves wielding hotly forged steel and freshly sharpened axes.  No, but the first born was merely eccentric!  And who ever heard of a platonic marriage?  Not even paladins were required to be <b>that</b> dedicated.
<br><br>
While these thoughts tumbled around in his head making him angry and confused, Omonero continued his ceremony.  Galm saw him throw a golden ring into the water.
<br><br>
"I have come to discover if you have forgiven us, mighty lord.  I know we are not worthy, but I wonder if perhaps we are no longer so unworthy."
<br><br>
It glittered as it hung in the air at its apogee like a star, waiting for the priest to finish his speech.  Galm supposed that this would be a moment that a bard would spend hours singing about, the jumbled woe and beauty of such a sacrifice.  Glam glanced at the Human bard standing across from him and he imagined that he could read just those sort of words on his lips.  He was about to turn back to argue further with Glind when he saw a tear roll down the cheek of the Human.  Glam shook his head.  He was beginning to think that he was on a ship full of fools and lunatics.
<br><br>
Now that Omonero had made his sacrifice, each of the sailors approached the railing over which the priest's ring had passed and each tossed something precious into the sea.  As they did so they spoke an oath to Prexus and told the Ocean Lord why they had come.  Galm wasn't really paying attention to them, though.  He was trying to find some argument that would bring his brother back into his right mind.  He was quickly running out of time.
<br><br>
Motion to his left distracted him.  It was Fealwin.  She walked with a grace that belied her warrior's skills.  With anyone else Galm had little trouble distinguishing a warrior from, say, a priest or a miner.  Warriors don't walk like that, not like her.  They either stomp around with confidence, as did Galm himself, or they were more cat-like in the way that Glind was.  But Fealwin…  she walked with grace and confidence, true, but she also had a way about her that made her look too… feminine to be a warrior.  And yet she was one of the most talented swords… persons on Antonica.  And she was so damn beautiful…
<br><br>
And she was headed right for him.
<br><br>
"Gal, can we talk a moment?"  Her sandy-colored hair was cut short in a very utilitarian way that did nothing to take away from her beauty.  In ways it enhanced it by framing her face in such a way…   "Gal?"
<br><br>
"Huh, uh, yeah, sure.  Maybe you can talk my fool brother out of tossing away that damn hammer.  Maybe you can get through to him, he's your husband."
<br><br>
"No, Gal, I can't.  But that's what I want to talk to you about."  She led him down the short ladder to the main deck of the ship, where they could still hear the sailors offering gifts to the sea, but where they themselves would not be heard.  Being alone with Fealwin always made Galm nervous, though he was never quite sure why.
<br><br>
"Gal, now that you're hear with us, you really should understand what is at stake."  He absolutely hated the way she shortened his name.  She could never pronounce it properly anyway, though.  Something about the way that non-Dwarves think, he figured, made them screw his name up all the time.  She probably thought of it as a cute way of avoiding embarrassment at her inability to speak his name.  But it just made him mad.  Luckily, she mistook the sour look on his face for something else.  "I know you don't approve of Omonero, or the sacrifice that we are making here.  But it is so very important.  Tunare fears for the world.  She tells us that a great evil is about to be born.  It will be born on a land that is beyond our reach, but land that is still part of the Mother.  Some of her children fight this evil already, she assures us.  But they will perish soon."
<br><br>
"That's it?  I mean, I feel sorry for whoever it is that's dying to this evil, but why is that our problem?  That evil can't reach us, the oceans are closed.  And even we do get through, there aren't enough of us here to make any sort of a dent in anything that Tunare is afraid of."
<br><br>
"The oceans are closed, but that doesn't mean that this evil can't reach us.  Did you meet Roawed?  He's the High Elf…  Well, he has been researching travel to other planes.  It has been his desire to actually travel to the home of the Lord of Hate and take our fight there, to destroy the god himself!  Very brash, if you ask me.  But while researching he met a few others doing similar research; Humans, he said.  After his brief conversations with them, he changed his research.  And he discovered that there might be a magical portal to the ancient continent of Kunark.  And he thinks that those Human wizards were working for someone else, perhaps one of the minions of Hate.  When I heard his story, I knew that we had to get to Kunark immediately.  Back home, most of the forces of Tunare are seeking these two wizards and whomever they were working for.  But the key lies on the lost continent."
<br><br>
"So have the wizard take you there.  You said he knew the portal."
<br><br>
"No, he knows that it exists, but not where it is or how to use it.  He hopes to find the keys to that mystery on Kunark."  Fealwin looked down at him with a concerned expression.  The intensity of her concern made Galm look away.  Damnable paladins are so close to their own soul and to that of their gods, and so skilled at leadership, that they instinctively knew how to break down your defenses.  Glind did it to him all the time.  Now it was Fealwin.  "Gal, this is important.  And we can't turn back now to take you to safety."
<br><br>
"Heh, I don't need protectin'.  I'm a hero in my own right, ya know.  Why, I…"
<br><br>
Fealwin interrupted him, gently but sternly.  "I know that.  All that I am saying is that we can not turn back.  But in order to go ahead, each of us must sacrifice something to the Ocean Lord, something of great personal value."  She reached down the top of her tunic and pulled out a long silver chain.  Dangling from it, glinting brightly in the harsh sea sun, was a charm.  It was a small brass boot, not much larger than the last joint of Galm thick thumb.  "This was my daughter's.  Glind cast it into the bronze himself.  Until now, only Glind knew about this.  When I was very young I was…  attacked … by a sailor in my home town, Freeport.  I had just become orphaned and had no place else to go, so when he offered me a place to sleep and a meal, I was grateful.  I escaped him a few days later and found refuge in the temple.  They fed me and comforted me.  But soon I knew that I was pregnant.  I had always thought that it was a sin to become pregnant without being married, so I fled the temple.  I was afraid that Marr would strike me and my baby if I stayed…"
<br><br>
Galm was stunned.  Not only had he never pictured this powerful woman as ever having been so helpless and confused, but here she was telling him this terrible tale.  He wanted to stop her, to tell her that he didn't really want to know so much about her.  He didn't want the burden of this secret.  But the tears in her eyes made him silent.  In every other way she sounded as though she were talking about the weather, as tears started to pour down her face.  She made no effort to wipe them away.
<br><br>
"It was hard, finding enough food to stay alive.  Especially when I just didn't trust anyone.  But I managed.  Glind calls me a survivor.  That sounds generous to me, I think of myself as little more than an animal during that year.  But I did survive.  My daughter was born under the stairs of one of the inns.  She lived for sixteen days.  I stole clothing for her…"  Her tears suddenly turned to sobs.  "This is all that I have left of her."
<br><br>
Galm was at a loss.  He wanted to comfort her, somehow.  But fifteen years of chopping people up with an axe hadn't left him the time nor the inclination to learn much about comforting people, and especially his brother's beautiful wife.  He took a breath to say something, paused, then let it out when her realized that he had nothing to say.  Instead, he sat heavily onto the deck.  He put his head in his hands, overcome with confusion and sympathy, desperately trying to decide what to do, how to react.  He decided that he needed Glind.
<br><br>
Then he felt long strong arms around his shoulders.  He smelled her, giving off the scent of lavender and roses even here on the open sea.  And she said to him, "I'm sorry, Gal.  I didn't mean to upset you."  He felt one of her tears fall upon his ear.  "I only meant to show you how important this was.  You need to find something important to you, and give it to the sea.  Now that you're here, I know that we need you with us, Gal."
<br><br>
Her use of the short name no longer bothered him.
