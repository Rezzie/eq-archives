It's a tough week to write an editorial.  Two weeks ago I had a problem downloading patches, and couldn't play.  All this week I've been in classes, and my head has been far too full of... stuff... to think of playing EverQuest.  Actually, maybe that's something worth talking about...
<br><br>
Let me start by suggesting that if anyone is having trouble downloading patches, I might know how to fix it.  First, and foremost, scan for the CIH virus. <a href=http://www.symantec.com/ns-search/region/uk/avcenter/venc/cih.html?NS-search-set=/37fea/aaadPyzE_fea140&NS-doc-offset=1&>This is a pretty good place</a> to read up on the virus and find out how to get rid of it.  And update your virus scanner (or go buy one, then update it).  If you're reading this, you probably spend a lot of time on the net.  You need a virus scanner.
<br><br>
But that wasn't my problem.  Something changed some of my TCP/IC settings.  I haven't a clue what they were, nor am I certain what software made the changes (it wasn't me).  I suspect it was the Mankind demo that I was trying out based on a suggestion that I add it to my editorial about upcoming RPGs (it didn't appear to be a roleplaying game at all, by the way).  How the problem came about isn't important.  And fixing it was easy, once someone pointed me in the right direction.  I just deleted the protocol and reinstalled.  Easy as heck, and still it took me a week to figure it out.  Thanks to the folks on the boards at the official EverQuest site.  Someone there (sorry, don't remember who) gave me the hint I needed.
<br><br>
I dunno, maybe someone out there has the same problem, and I've helped...
<br><br>
So, two weeks without playing EverQuest.  And, oddly, I'm not really in a rush to get back in.  I'm in a slump.  I get that way with everything.  I'm an avid reader, but there are some months that I don't crack open a single book.  I've missed a few of my Saturday gaming sessions over the last few weeks as well.  And I don't seem to mind.  I'll miss today as well (assuming you're reading this on the same Saturday that we publish...).  It happens.  It doesn't mean that I don't like doing these things anymore.  It just means that right now my brain needs a different sort of stimulation.  I'm always better off finding other interesting things to do for a while.  It gives me a chance to learn new things or find new hobbies.  It gives me a chance to start to miss the things that I've come to take for granted.  And when it's all over, I find a renewed source of love for the things that I left behind.
<br><br>
So I'm off to try to puzzle out the intricacies of coding Access.  I think I'll develop a database that will let me track the performance of NFL teams and generate stats and comparisons.  It might just give me an edge when picking games...
