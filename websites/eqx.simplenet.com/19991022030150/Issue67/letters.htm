While having to admit that the game is quite an accomplishment, I am
already very much addicted, there seems to be something inherently wrong
with releasing the game before what impact the loads on the logins had
been established. The Phase Four beta seemed to be about just that..and
the performance in the first few days was dismal at best. Although the
logins seemed to get better as time went on..the last night of the beta
should have been some sort of indication of what was to come. Zone
crashes, lag, and the like were very prevalent on the Tarew Marr server.
In fact the last day I noticed a good many graphic bugs (Floating trees,
teleporting monsters, etc.) and felt the beta probably should have gone
on a bit longer. The bottom line is this is a product..like any other.
"Ironing Out" should have been done in the betas..and as of this writing
the login issues have not been resolved. If this is not solved soon (
today is 3/21 ) Sony should think about extending the "Free Month" until
it is..

<em>[Ed. - We received a lot of mail about this issue, most with suggestions about how
Verant should act, how they should have acted and how mad folks were at all the down time.
As usual, I'm not going to print them all here, there were just too many.  I chose this one
simply because i wanted to stress that Verant has extended the free month.  Anyone
that signed up on or before the 24th was given an additional two weeks of free time.]</em>

 This is a great site--a lot of fun. I hope you keep it going for a long
time. My compliments.
