The staff of EQX was challenged recently by our friend Wynn Orill. 
He wondered what sort of stories we could create based on one of the 
EverQuest screen shots out there. Well, we figured we'd take that 
challenge. And, of course, we are going to use the screen shot from EQX. 
So click on one of the titles below and read what happens when you 
challenge our staff. :)
<br><br>
Each of the stories was written independently of the others, and is a story unto
itself.

Enjoy.
