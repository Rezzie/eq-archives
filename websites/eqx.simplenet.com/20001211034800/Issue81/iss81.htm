  She fled to the window, and stopped short.  Iron bars crisscrossed the glass.  Not even a Gnome could have slipped through the spaces in between.  She stood in the center of the room, panting, eyes wild, and fingered her dagger.  A paltry weapon, it would never suffice to defend her if they were to find her.  She looked up.  The same moldings surrounded the room, but there was no way up, no hangings, and the cases...

<b>Part Six</b>
<br><br>
	As Hargor began speaking the strange words that I will never understand, I looked over to t'Ceira and mouthed, "I love you, Hon." Feeling as giddy as an ogreling who just killed his first halfling.  I watched the glowing lights form on his hands and then pass onto t'Ciera and then me.  It seemed as though the lights and words were reaching a crescendo, my heart beating wildly as if I were riding into battle with my brothers, then a blinding bright light... Darkness... and... Quiet.

After the past few articles were not well received by the EQX reading public, I sort of swore myself off of articles.  <em>Just write stories</em>, I said to myself.  But then I've had some kind of problem with the game lately and it was something I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Now I sort of know.  There's a lot of pseudo-psychology in here, (the only kind I practice) so be prepared for amateur theories.  But then they all pertain to me, so I'm the only one I can really insult with this.

Alhazred stepped back from the freshly killed skeleton. He took a breath and then bent down to salvage what he could from the corpse. Bone chips and a few copper pieces. <em>You will rise again my friend,</em> thought Alhazred, <em>but this time under my power</em>.
<br><br>
It had been only a few days since Alhazred had emerged from the Lodge of the Dead. His powers in necromancy were still weak, but he could feel them growing with every new kill. The bitterness and hate within him fuelled his passion. <em>They will pay for what they did</em>, he thought and he rose to his feet and strode off deeper into the Nektoulous Forest.

"...and so the great goddess Tunare, Mother of All, came upon a small island, and this she named Faydwer, and on it she seeded a race of..." Blah, blah, blah. Falundir found the afternoon classes the most boring of them all, with that red-faced priest Fyrdian waffling on about the history of Faydwer. As if she didn't know it all ready! Next he would go on about the founding of Felwithe. Falundir smiled as he began intoning "...and as the foundations were laid, the elvenkind realized what a wonderful city it would grow to become, and they set about to make it even more glorious, enchanting powerful protective magics into all the walls of Felwithe. This is what... "<em>Gives them their wondrous glow</em>, thought Falundir.

I logged out last night with a feeling of disquiet.
<br><br>
I've always been a casual role-player.  I'm not much for thees and thous, nor am I a big fan of constantly monitoring in and out of character speech.  I figure that most folks know which is which, and while I try to keep all my says in character, group talk and tells are often out of character.  In that sense, I guess, I'm not much of a role-player.

What an extremely silly <a href="../Issue80/line.htm">article</a> by Russel Linton last issue. He seems to
claim that 'powergamers' and 'roleplayers' simply can't co-exist in the
same game, and that they will in every possibly way ruin the game for
one another. Something which cleary isn't true.
