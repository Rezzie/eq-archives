We here at EQX are writing a round robin story.  Each of us have turned in
a character description to the others and will use those character
descriptions to tell a part of a story.  I began the tale, and each
successive week another staff member will add to the story, picking up
where the previous author left off.  The story is completely in the hands
of each author, so we don't know where it will go next.  One of the really
fun things an author can do is to finish on a cliffhanger, leaving the next
author with a difficult situation :).  Let's see where our imaginations
take us!

	Amlaith looked over the clearing.  Pieces of slain animals lay intermingled with the severed limbs of what looked like a small farm gathering.  The frozen stare of a dead girl looked blankly at pieces of what may have been a cousin, or a friend.  The clearing was drenched in blood, but the center of the clearing looked oddly clean, like some sort of weird force had drained it of all blood.
<br><br>
	*Dark elf scent here* came the thought from Banner.  Carefully striding over the bits and pieces of bodies, the sleek panther sniffed delicately at some foot-traces.  Amlaith nodded, and began to stride back to the group, who had sent him ahead to scout.
<br><br>
	Mundas, Elaan, and Oghma stood off by the roadside, waiting for him.  Approaching them, Amlaith smiled inwardly at how each one's stance reflected their personality.  Elaan, the proud paladin, stood with arms folded, his straight back and keen glance giving him the air of a hero, even in repose.  Mundas, in his loud colors and ill-fitting clothing, look like an absent minded professor, though barely clearing Amlaith's waist in height.  In typical gnome fashion, he was messing with some gadget, clearly engrossed in some magical toy, oblivious to the dangers that one could find in a forest.  Oghma, on the other hand, looked about inquisitively, as if trying to absorb everything around him.  Though perhaps equally absorbed, Oghma's manner indicated he was trying to take in everything around him, and fit it into what he already knew, and examine the implications of the new joining of knowledge.
<br><br>
	Amlaith walked silently over to the assembled group.  "Massacre.  Dark elves."
<br><br>
	"Quite succinct, Amlaith," Oghma chuckled.  "From your profusion of words, I would guess that there has been a massacre, and that Dark elves were involved in the slaying?"
<br><br>
	Amlaith nodded.
<br><br>
	Oghma frowned.  "I guess we should take a look at it."  The party trooped over to the clearing and looked about in disgust.  Oghma examined the bloodless center area carefully.  "Mundas," he said, "what do you think?  I am not the enchanter you are, and it goes outside of my knowledge, though I have some ideas."
<br><br>
	Mundas trotted over to look at the cleared area.  "It looks like some form of appeasement sacrifice to Innoruk, Ogh." Mundas commented, "You probably saw the symbols here, and here."
<br><br>
	"Yes, but what use would such a sacrifice accomplish, magically?"
<br><br>
	"Most dark elf ritual enchantment is additive to the power of the caster," Mundas pondered.  "Usually it builds up to a large single use."
<br><br>
	"You two are so clinical!" Elaan fumed.  "You stand about here, talking about enchantments and worship, when there are dark elves running around here, slaying innocent farmfolk!  Let's hunt them down, not talk about it!"
<br><br>
	Oghma and Mundas looked at each other and nodded.  "Let's see if we can find some tracks to help us," Oghma said.
<br><br>
	Amlaith, who had already been scouting about, pointed towards the southeast.  "These guys talk way too much," he thought.
<br><br>
	The group continued on to the southeast, more carefully than before, taking care not to lose the trail they were following.
<br><br>
	"Elaan, have you had any experiences with dark elves?" Oghma asked.
<br><br>
	"I was once part of a group which defended a town against a large group of evil creatures, including trolls and ogres.  They were led by dark elves." Elaan frowned.  "The dark elves were quite cunning, and their spell casters seriously weakened the defenses before they would mount an assault.  We barely threw back the last wave of attackers, but by then the enemy forces were weakened, so no final assault was made."  He shuddered.  "I faced only one dark elf in single battle, and had I been any slower, or not protected by the powers of Erollisi Marr, I would not be talking with you today.  The dark one was lightning fast with his blades."
<br><br>
	"I know a dark elf named Zasstryn H'yonith.  He claims to be a dark elf ambassador, but he is something else also, I think," Oghma commented. "He once claimed insult against a diplomat in Freeport, and fought the diplomat's champion.  I have rarely seen a man so outclassed as that champion.  Zass also has a wicked wit, which sliced the champion worse than his blades.  I found him an engaging person, though one I would not associate with frequently.  Doom seems to follow him, as it does so many of the dark ones."
<br><br>
	The conversation lagged, each individual alone with their thoughts, and before long they came to a small village surrounded by a valley.
<br><br>
	"Trail ends."
<br><br>
	"Amlaith! What do you mean trail ends!" Oghma grimaced. "Does it stop suddenly? Or fade out? Or just disappear?  Maybe they climbed a tree, or dug a hole?  What?"
<br><br>
	Amlaith gave Oghma a slow look.  "Faded," he said eventually.
<br><br>
	"Thank you!" Oghma looked a bit less frustrated.
<br><br>
	"Perhaps they saw the village and tried to leave?" Mundas queried. 
<br><br>
	Elaan snorted. "Or they saw daylight, and couldn't stand the sight of the goodness of this village before them."
<br><br>
	"Let's see if they have seen anything unusual in the village.  Perhaps the farmers were from there?" said Mundas.
<br><br>
	As they went down into the valley, they noticed that the town square was ablaze with activity.  Approaching the town walls they heard angry cries, and the party hastened to see what was going on.  The town gates were wide open, as if no one was manning the gates, and the party looked at each other in concern.  
<br><br>
"Empty walls with dark elves about!" Elaan muttered.  "What's going on?"
<br><br>
"Maybe we're too late!  The elves might have already attacked!" Mundas shouted.
<br><br>
Banner padded along beside Amlaith.  He looked nervously about him.  Large cats such as he were not welcome in towns, though he felt this may be an emergency where he may be needed.
<br><br>
As the party ran down the main street of town, they saw two large bonfires in the center of town.  Angry shouts came from the square.  "Murderers!" "Butchers!" "Slayers of children!"
<br><br>
Entering the town square, they saw a large crowd in the center of the square, surrounding the bonfires.  Two dark elves tied to long poles which were being led towards the bonfires were squirming and fighting.  Various pots, pans, vegetables, and refuse were being thrown at them, occasionally pelting the pole-carriers, who yelled insults back to the crowd.
<br><br>
Suddenly one of the elves looked over to the group and yelled, "OGHMA, help!  I didn't do this!  HELP!"
<br><br>
"Zass!" Oghma exclaimed.
