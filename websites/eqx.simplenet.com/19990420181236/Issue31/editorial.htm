It's hotter than hell here in Orange County.  It's 11 pm and it's too hot, too hot to sleep.
<br><br>
Hell if that doesn't sound like the start of a pulp detective novel, then I don't know what does.
<br><br>
But it's true.  It's hot.  And it will be even hotter tomorrow when I have six or seven gamers piled into this little apartment.  And as if that wasn't going to be uncomfortable enough, there will be two people that I have never met in here with us.  You see, I've invited two of my on-line friends to play with us.  I have never met these guys.  I've talked to them a lot on-line, sure.  I've even talked to one of them on the phone several times.  But never met then in person.
<br><br>
That's gonna be weird.  I mean, heck, up until now these guys were tanks to me.  Really, that's the only face I have for them, lightnings.  For you non-Tanarus players that's a swift but lightly armored tank…  But I think that's better than having been playing a graphical RPG with these guys.  Then I might actually have some sort of humanoid image in my head, and they would never look like that…
<br><br>
But these guys are lucky, our standard GM is out on vacation and we have plug in the autopilot GM…  Er, I better rephrase that since he reads this.  Nah!  <b>: )</b>  The replacement GM actually runs a game where we laugh, joke, goof around and cavort.  Well, ok, I admit that I have never cavorted in my life.  I've seen it done, it disgusts me.
<br><br>
The new GM brings with him a new game.  We are playing humanoids.  You know, the races that look like humans but are not.  Not the namby-pamby Elves, not the stumpy little Dwarves, no silly little Halflings.  Our party currently consists of two (yes, two!) Minotaurs, one Goblin and his wolf and me, the Accacaroca… Aca…  er, bird man.  Yup, I get to play a Goblin with wings!  It's a blast.  Last week we ambushed a Human caravan!
<br><br>
Playing this game has redoubled my love for EverQuest.  In UO you can't play an Ogre.  You can't be a ravaging Troll.  You just can't have the variety that you can in EverQuest.  Now I do have some concern that even though those races are available, we still won't really get to play them.  I am worried that I will find myself as a Troll amongst really big Humans.  I want to see tyranical leaders, smashing the weaklings when they don't do as they are told.  I want tribalism.  I want grunting and scratching.  I want to feel that I CAN claw my way to the top.
<br><br>
Well, perhaps EQ will give me that.  If not, I got me a new GM to abuse and some new player to indoctrinate.
