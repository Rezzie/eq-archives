	<big><big>"O</big></big>f course sir!  I will just let you go about your business,"
	the fat man said as he put his hands up as if he was trying to defend himself.
	The innkeeper backed up back behind his bar with his hands still raised up to
	protect himself.  Indreju turned towards the table that he had been at earlier
	this night to see that the figure of Fennin Ro was not there any longer.
	<br><br>
	"Where is it!  I left a small crystal figurine on my table before I was forced to
	leave," he said as he turned back to the innkeeper pointing his sword at the
	man’s head.

	"I have it right here," a soft, warm voice said from behind him.  He turned to see
	the female bard holding the crystalline statue of his god in her palm.  The statue
	had an odd reddish glow, one that Indreju had never seen before.  And it was getting
	brighter.
	<br><br>
	"I’m sorry those men chased you out of here earlier, please you must understand,
	not everyone in this town feels that way about elves," she said.  She had dark eyes
	that seemed to smolder and hold knowledge all of their own, as if they had seen too
	much in their time alive.  The beautiful woman held out the figure of Fennin Ro
	that was continually getting brighter.

<td valign="top" width="34%" style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-align: justify">
	Just as she handed him the figure, four of the drunken men came in from the front
	door.  Indreju spun to look towards the kitchen, and saw others coming from that
	direction too.  He turned to put his back up against a wall that he knew no one
	would be coming from, and started to back up.
	<br><br>
	"Move away from the elf, Lady, and then leave." One of the men from the doorway
	said.  Indreju recognized him as the one with the sword from the clearing.  He
	didn’t seem to be drunk, and he looked as if he was good with that sword of his
	by the way he held himself.  "Elf, there is no where to go, you might as well give
	up!"
	<br><br>
	Indreju was not about to give up, but he had no idea how he was going to get out
	of this situation.
