All tales start somewhere…..

<br><br>
To understand this story, and any others that may follow, you need to know a little about me and about the land. Otherwise, this story will sound like a piece of junk and will be burned ( magic users) ripped apart (fighters) or eaten (Ogres and trolls, though I'm sure some halflings could do this too) by you, the reader.  
<br><br>
	When the gods created this world, they were bored. Bored to hell, actually, so they gave it to the demented god of war known as Rallos Zek.  He, already owning a world, gave it to his even sicker, but less powerful, second cousin (possibly inbred) Vallon, with instructions to think up something evil and demented (note the theme here) and then create the world.  Now, while Rallos wanted nothing more than blood and war and screams on his world, his cousin wanted something different. Oh, he wanted blood and guts as well, but he wanted it to be more entertaining.
<br><br>
	So Vallon went to his sister Tallon Zek and together, they cerated this pitiful mudpit that I live on.  Please note, the following conversation is my interpetation, not the worlds. 
<br><br>
	It went something like this:
<br><br>
	V: Hey Sis! What's up?
<br><br>
	T: Not much, my brother.  I'm disemboweling someone, but I can put that on hold for you.
<br><br>
	V: Oh, joy.  Our second cousin Vallon gave me a world to shape.
<br><br>
	T: Wow! What are you going to do?
<br><br>
	V: I don't know. I want something sick and demented, but not pure mayhem.  Can you think of something? 
<br><br>
	T: You like planning things, right?
<br><br>
	V: Um….yeah.  (Vallon wasn't the smartest god, mind you)
<br><br>
	T: Well, then make all the races hate the other races!
<br><br>
	V: think that will work? Sounds boring.
<br><br>
	T: um. Well, how about if you make some of the races like each other, and some hate each other?
<br><br>
	V: Oh wow! Great idea!
<br><br>
	And after words, a world was born and there was much celebration, drinking, and beheadings.  And thus the races of our Norrath, instead of being peaceful, all found allies, and then started killing their enemies.  There are the Evil races (not their name, of course but who the hell cares?) of the Ogres, Trolls and Dark Elves.  There are the human races of the Erudites, Barbarians and the simply put Humans.  The midget races (again, not their name, but again I don't care.  I'll call them that and if they don't want to be called that, then…well, you know.) And then, there are the Elves. The High Elves, the Half Elves, and then my people, the wood elves.
<br><br>
	(Of course I'm leaving out the animalistic races of gnolls, orcs and goblins, but they hate everyone, so they don't count.)
<br><br>
	Now, a little about me.  Well, lets see.  I'm an elf. A wood elf.  True, Elves usefully aren't this grim, aren't this grizzled, but war does strange things to a person.  I was born Taean'icathin Sarnonian, Taean for short, first and last son of the minor noble Sarchochi Icathin and his lady, Dargiith Sarnonian.  I wasn't a good child- I almost killed my tutor by pushing him off the top platform of the city during a lesson (a nearby wizard levitated him before he hit)- but my parents were kind and happy and gave me anything I could want. Which, of course, seemed like a bad thing to me.  So, at the age of 16, I grabbed a sword and went out into the forest to become a brave warrior. I'll start from there with this story.  Maybe, if you like it, I'll tell the rest of my tale. But for now, this is all you get.  Live with it.

	Here's something I learned when I left.  Somehow, somewhere, in everyone's mind on this planet, is a thing. This thing lets us receive messages on different bands.  For instance, I agree to group with some friends, and suddenly only those in our group can hear what we say.  Kind of weird, but it's the truth.  Thus, when I hooked up with my friends Accari and Stantax, a mage and ranger, and we went hunting in the orc camps, we somehow learned to talk to each other, and only to each other.  And, of course, being the geniuses we are, we had a great plan. Being the strongest of us, I would lead an orc into an ambush and then we would kill him.  The other two were much more advanced than me, and gave me a rusted out long sword.  I was rather pleased with it.  Along the way I found a dead orc and stole his vest. Its black chain mail went well with my rich dandy's clothes, so of course I took it, and tried not to stagger under its weight.  
<br><br>
	Well, while the other two waited on top of a hill, I walked along the bottom, looking for orcs to kill.  I cleverly hid against a tree and waited patiently for one of the ugly blue skinned brutes to come out.  I didn't have to wait long.  A small orc, carrying a mace of some kind, soon lumbered past.  With a quick order to be ready to my companions, I jumped out behind it and said something to the extent of this: "Ogga booga!"
<br><br>
	At which point the orc looked at me, howled, and charged, and at which point I turned around and fled towards my companions.  While I was running up the hill, I heard a shout in my mind.   
<br><br>
	<em>Tae, don't come! Another orc is attacking! Get up here!</em>
<br><br>
	At which point I tripped, fell down in a heap, and rolled down the hill right past the startled orc.  I managed to reach out and grab it's leg, bringing it down with me.  As soon as the world stopped spinning, I punched at the monster, forgetting I now had a sword. The thing blinked, raised it's mace, and hit me over the head once, very, very hard.  
 <br><br>
	I stood stock still for a second, then fell over.  I'm not sure what happened next, but I do remember a horrid scream, a grunt, then blood.  Lots of it.  Being the brave warrior, I promptly threw up, and then fainted.
<br><br>
	Next thing I know, my two companions are standing over me, with a third elf, this one aging in appearance, next to them.  I asked what happened, they said I'd been attacked and knocked out.  The other elf, named Lavin, had saved me, literally decapitating the orc in the process.  The elf started to say something, but at that point, a shout went up.  I'm not sure if it was on some sort of elven frequency or what, but I knew the others heard it.
<br><br>
	"All elves to Lower Faydark Entrance! The shorties are attacking! Repeat!  Massive shorty attack!  All elves to the entrance! They are halfway to Felwithe! Hurry!"
<br><br>
	Lavin's jaw snapped shut, and he clenched.  Already we could hear the answering insults from the dwarfs and gnomes who were invading, the shouted orders in elvish for mobilization, and the screams.  Those horrible screams.  
<br><br>
	Lavin looked at me, a fighter of no experience, and looked at my two companions, who had been fighting for 5 or six seasons.  Apparently he had decided that they would take care of me, for he said suddenly "We can't stay here. And the others need us. Follow me."  
<br><br>
	Accari and Stantax apparently decided that they were gonna go, besides my objections on the contrary and my great plan that we should "defend the city" so I followed the other three through the forest at breakneck speed.  
<br><br>
	We were about two minutes from the cave that served as a gateway between the realm of the dwarves and the realm of the elves, when a tree two feet from my head exploded in a fiery burst.  Lavin shouted "Down!" and we all dived as another explosion occurred where my head had been.  We heard a curse in gnomish, and the Lavin jumped up and loosed an arrow.  It caught the small creature through the throat, silencing it's next spell rather abruptly.  We got up and kept moving, more carefully now.
<br><br>
	Twice along the road we encountered foes.  The first time we ran into a lost orc, and we quickly killed it.  I was rather proud I had managed to hit something- even if it was just the creatures sword, which I would have missed if it hadn't brought the axe up to block my stroke.  But, being the baby fighter I was, I thought it rather grand.  
<br><br>
	The next time came when we ran right into a dwarf fighter.  He was dressed in plate armor- PLATE armor- and carried a giant axe.  Lavin ordered us to go around him, and as we were passing him by we saw Lavin draw his sword, a giant two-handed affair which seemed to glow in the darkness. I would have stopped and watched, if the other two hadn't dragged me on.  
<br><br>
	We arrived as a tried looking elf, a captain of the guard of Felwithe, was ordering in a new group of elves to the front lines. I could see furious fighting, and the guard captain proved it by throwing us right into the fray, as another elf fell down, a gaping hole in his chest. I felt my gorge rising again, but forced it down as I took my place next to a grizzled veteran.  
<br><br>
	Soon enough, a dwarf warrior appeared in front of me.  I lashed out with my sword, and he fell back.  I was too busy to notice, as another fighter, this time a gnome rushed up to take his place.  I slashed out at this one, and forced my arms to keep swinging that sword.
<br><br>
	The next few minutes were pure hell and chaos on this world.  Slowly but surely, as more reinforcements arrived and less shorty forces came, we kept pushing them back.  I didn't realize that we had forced them through the cave until the veteran next to me stopped me.  'Lad, Lad! Calm down! They're done for!"
<br><br>
	I stopped, all at once, my muscles suddenly exhausted, and leaned against the closest wall.  I could see the portal at the end of the cave shimmer once with the last departing gnome or dwarf.  There was silence.
<br><br>
	Then suddenly, someone cheered.  It was like watching a tidal wave.  It started out raggedly, but then picked up pace, till I could have sworn every elf was cheering like he was crazy.  We had repelled yet another fight.  We had won. 
<br><br>
	But oh, the price.  Bodies everywhere.  Accari had lost an arm, and I found Stantax as she lay dying, a spear thrust through her. 
<br><br>
	"Oh god, Stant, oh gods…" I mumbled as I held her in my arms.
<br><br>
	"Tae…please……please help…"
<br><br>
	She died then.  I couldn't cry.  My heart was like wood.  I was too tired to cry.  Years later, I would look back and remember her, and the countless others I had known who had died with me.   But then was my first stroke with death in any personal manner.  I sort of lost it then.  I suddenly felt like I had to kill, like I was going to go tearing through the city of Kaladim and tear the heart out of every damnable dwarf, then go on and destroy all the gnomes, and anyone else who got in my way.  I would have too, if I hadn't been so tired.  That night I went home to my rich house, and my warm bed sheets, and cried.  
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
	"That's it?" you, the reader, cry?  "Where is the great tale of victory, the great claims to glory, the beautiful women rescued from certain death?"  
<br><br>
	Well, trust me, somewhere, somehow, someone did all those things.  But not me.  I'm a fighter, a brawler. I'm, just another guy on this gods cursed (literally!) world of mine. True, I've had my share of adventure, and of heroics, and of beautiful women, but I started out like that.  A snot nosed kid trying to be impressive.  And, in truth, I'm still just that, except that now I'm good at being impressive. 
<br><br>
	Al those stories you hear where the hero always wins, where everything is black and white, where giant world shakers become famous. Those are all lies.  What I tell is the absolute truth. I refuse to give in to the heroics, to the fame.  What I tell are tales of truth.  
<br><br>
	And in the end, that's the only type that matters.
