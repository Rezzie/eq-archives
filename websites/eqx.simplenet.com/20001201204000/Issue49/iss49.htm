"By Bristlebane, this place reeks" muttered the rogue as he shifted on his
lofty perch, the stench of death, decay, and defilement permeating the dank
air. "Ozy will pay extra for this one, for sure." Kendrick adjusted his
gear and shifted forward a bit to get a better view of the happenings
beneath him. In the darkest of the dark places in all of Norrath, three figures
convened below him.

As the party began to break camp the next morning, Oghma pondered Beldro's story.  He knew that though the dark elves were master liars, every lie has in it a bit of truth.  Beldro's tale of the theft was plausible, though some of it was a bit boastful, as the dark elves reveled in outwitting each other.  Oghma sometimes thought that if the dark elves would stop warring on each other, they would take over the world.  It was also reasonable to assume that the dark elf clan the book was stolen from was hunting down the thief.  Loss of face was, in dark elf society, a painful blow to a clan and the restoration of that clan's prestige was of the utmost importance.

The heavy scent of fish and salt water assaulted his main-lander's sensibilities as he made his way down the mist drenched portside avenue of Freeport. Despite days in the bustling city, he had grown no fonder of the stench of fish. He understood the necessity, however, and so bore it with discomfort. 
<br><br>
He had to admit, the city was indeed a great launch pad for his career. With it's large population and oft-raucous crowd of sailors, the local authorities often had trouble keeping tabs on all it's less savory citizens. Though the lithe elf had no past record nor run ins with the city militia, most of the guards he had come across watched him with silent, judgmental eyes, begging for him to do something to give them an excuse to banish him -or worse- kill him.

The god-like leader of the Freeport army gritted his teeth. The perspiration forming on his black and grey striped brow trickled down his left cheek as he swiveled to watch every step, every motion that his incoming foe made. He thought over and over in his mind how this man's painted face reflected how unpredictable he must actually be. Seeing the striding warrior coming to him was on foot, Brenton dismounted. He wasn't quite sure as to whether or not this was an act of bravery, or sheer stupidity, he would however mimic the ritual of these mindless northerners.

Well, the group dynamic is changing.  When we started out we were a group of individuals.  Not that most of us couldn't or wouldn't work together.  We just didn't know each other all that well.  But my character, Ryan, was forced to admit that he had a problem.  Due to events in his recent past, the walking dead terrify him.  And our even more recent encounter with a vampire (a mere planer vampire) made that clear to everyone<b>...</b>

Hail!

First, I want to let you know that I enjoy EQ Express! I am new to the EQ
world and find it very enlightening. It is really helping me get a feel for
the world.

Second, in Oghma's article, "<a href="../Issue48/clans.htm">Dwarven Clans</a>"
he stated,
<br><br>
"This was an attempt to build a dwarven ethos and history, without any
Norrath background. None of it is official!"

<em>Considering the next issue will be on Halloween, I figured I'd ask something that had to do with horror and fear. What is "evil"'s place in an on-line game. Everyone hates to be tricked and deceived, how can you make people realize that is role-playing and not anti-social behavior.

While we wait for EverQuest to reach open beta, we at EverQuest Express like
to pretend we are already playing the game.  Here we offer a humorous look
at what our staff could be doing if this were true.  Watch this space, as a 
new staff member will be featured each week.  This week, Ian Ash.
