A letter to Razor:
<br><br>
Regarding your latest <a href="../Issue26/plague.htm">article on IRC</a>...
<br><br>
I am a regular in #EverQuest and have seen nothing but infantile behaviour
from the ops. Name calling is a big thing with some of them, and several
seem to think that their needs outweigh even 50+ other users'. Yet another
looks at every single thing everyone says with a pessimistic, scournful eye
and refuses to partake in any such discussion. All of them have ego trips
and will kick/ban for no reason, what so ever.

So I bet you're asking why I keep going back? Even if you're not, I'm gonna
tell ya. It seems that this channel is known to be the 'official'
headquarters of EverQuest on IRC, so all of the chats by Aradune himself are
held there. Anyone who asks where they can go are directed to this channel,
and most (if not all) of the others are shunned and completely forgotton by
the rest of the EQ world. So, in other words, the conversation in the other
channels leaves much to be desired.
<br><br>
Guess I'm just rambling again, but these #Everquest people have been pissing
me off for quite some time. *shrug*

I was reading absor's latest <a href="../issue26/editorial.htm">editorial</a> concerning some players being stuck in
a rut, and I thought back to the days just before I quit. You made some
passing reference to players waiting and waiting and waiting for something to
change and for things to get better and this brought to mind something a
friend of mine known as Avan said to me just after canceling our accounts.
It's not much, almost a throwaway, but I have always felt it to be quite
fitting:
<br><br>
*snip* "...I could go on and on, but my loss of faith was my loss of interest.
I kept playing UO because I could see better things on the horizon, you know?
Just over the next hill, was greener grazing.  But when we got there, it was
all yellow grass.  Blah."
<br><br>
Just figured it fit with the topic. Keep up the good work!
<br><br>
