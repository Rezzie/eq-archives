  Express Submission Guidelines:</font></b></big> 
</center>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  EverQuest Express is always willing to read submissions for publication. Some 
  of our best stuff comes from readers. But due to the fact that our editor (me) 
  does not get paid to do this, and due to the fact that I have other things in 
  my life besides EQX (I didn't say a LOT of things!), I would appreciate it if 
  all articles sent in for consideration were sent with the following things in 
  mind: <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Submitting Written Work:</b> <br>
  <br>
  </font>
<ol style="text-align: justify">
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I use Microsoft 
    Word 97. I can import nearly anything, but Word files are the easiest. If 
    you are real ambitious you can insert HTML codes in the appropriate places, 
    but it's probably better if you don't since I'll likely change it to match 
    the style of EQX anyhow. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Write your article 
    with a word processor, not directly into your e-mail software (unless it spell 
    checks). I really don't have the time to fix spelling errors. I will, if the 
    work is good enough otherwise. But if there are too many things to fix, I 
    won't make the effort. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Read what you've 
    written. Grammatical errors will be treated just like spelling errors. I'll 
    fix some if the article is good enough, but not many. Obviously this excludes 
    intentional misspellings and grammatical errors included for characterization 
    or to prove a point. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Points 2 and 
    3 are given with the clear understanding that not all of our readers speak 
    English as their primary language. Unfortunately EverQuest Express is targeted 
    to an English speaking audience. So if you have trouble writing in English 
    you may want to find someone to help you out before submitting your work to 
    us (and I'm not saying that our staff won't help as well, but I certainly 
    can't promise that we will either). We are not trying to be mean spirited 
    or exclusive. Our editor only speaks one language, so blame it on him. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will dismiss 
    without a second thought any submission that I find in poor taste. EQX will 
    not be printing anything that is exceptionally vulgar or abusing. I have no 
    problem with the occasional curse word. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I try to answer 
    all e-mails right after reading them. I will try to at least acknowledge that 
    I have received your submission. If you don't get a response from me within 
    a day or two, feel free to send a short e-mail asking me what I thought of 
    your work. But under no circumstances will I be interested in your work if 
    you pester me about it. And please don't pester the EQX staff either. Remember, 
    we do this for fun, not work. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We prefer all 
    written work be originally created for EQX. We are not very interested in 
    repeating work that has been seen on the net before. If it has been, please 
    let us know where. We will not immediately refuse to print such work, but 
    it will be considered less interesting to our readers if there is a good chance 
    that they have read it before. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EverQuest Express 
    reserves the right to hold publication of a submission until it is needed. 
    In practical terms this means that sometimes we have enough submissions in 
    a week to do two issues, and sometimes we have barely enough to make one whole 
    issue. For this reason, we will sometimes hold on to an article or story which 
    is not on a time-sensitive topic for a little while in case we are left high 
    and dry for content some week. If you are concerned about the disposition 
    of something which you sent us, please send us an e-mail and we'll be happy 
    to let you know if this is the case. Please don't go tell friends that we 
    are going to publish something in the next issue, because you will be embarrassed 
    when we don't. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We strive to 
    publish the best fiction and content we have available. With this goal in 
    mind, we have, over time, developed rule-of thumb issues that will result 
    in almost immediate rejection: <br>
    a) Articles and stories which are less than a page long are usually under-developed 
    and/or not thought out, so we will not publish them. <br>
    b) Character biographies are very rarely published here, unless there is a 
    story beyond the genesis of the character. Many character biographies are 
    simply coming of age/getting training/killing first monster/meeting first 
    friend, which are not enough to maintain interest. <br>
    c) Anything that ends with "To be continued" will never get the chance to 
    be initiated. Our early issues are full of unfinished stories. If your submission 
    has multiple parts, finish it before you submit it. <br>
    d) Although this is a re-statement of 2. and 3. above , it cannot be firmly 
    stated enough. Anything that our editors find needs grammar/spelling corrections 
    will likely not get published. If a work shows a high degree of promise we 
    will suggest the author re-submit it after re-editing, but this is fairly 
    rare. Please take the time and effort to proof-read your work, or have someone 
    else look at it. </font>
</ol>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
<b>Submitting Artwork:</b> <br>
<br>
</font> 
<ol style="text-align: justify">
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We use a column 
    format for EQX. We expect folks to be reading it at 1024 x 768, on a 15' monitor. 
    All things considered each of the three columns turns out to be less than 
    300 pixels wide. Please keep this in mind when you send in your work. Some 
    art does not shrink well. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are sending 
    in line art we will usually attempt to convert it to a transparent .gif file, 
    thus making it appear to be drawn directly onto the background. If you scan 
    such art it will usually appear with a very gray background. When we clean 
    that up it sometimes changes the appearance of the art. If possible, send 
    this kind of work with a single background color. If you scan it, please try 
    to clean it yourself. This will give you greater control over its final appearance 
    on EQX. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everything submitted 
    to EQX is considered property of the artist. We will make no claim on it except 
    as it appears on EQX. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We prefer all 
    artwork be originally created for EQX. We are not very interested in repeating 
    work that has been seen on the net before. If it has been, please let us know 
    where. We will not immediately refuse to publish such work, but it will be 
    considered less interesting to our readers if there is a good chance that 
    they have seen it before. </font>
</ol>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
<b>Becoming an EverQuest Express Staff Member:</b> <br>
<br>
At this time EQX is not really looking for new staff members. That does not mean 
that we won't take them anyway. But there are some things to consider before offering 
to join EQX. <br>
<br>
</font> 
<ol style="text-align: justify">
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Being on the 
    staff of EQX is a lot of work. It's not easy writing about EverQuest every 
    week. It takes time to think up interesting articles or stories, and even 
    more time to write them. EQX will not keep staff members that do not produce 
    work. It's harsh, but it's also what makes the whole thing work. It's not 
    fair to those that write each week when others don't write at all. If you 
    can't produce work with some consistency then just contribute when you can, 
    but don't ask to be on the staff. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone that 
    feels that they can write well enough to do the job should prove it. We want 
    to see several pieces of work from anyone that wants to join the staff. Send 
    in submissions. Keep doing it. If we like your work and you seem to be able 
    to produce with some frequency (really, that's a LOT harder than you might 
    think it is), then we may be interested. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask. If you 
    are interested in joining EQX, ask the editor. It can't hurt, and it won't 
    bother him. But if you do, make sure that you've read the two points above, 
    and that the editor has already published at least two of your works. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember, every 
    single person currently on the EQX staff started as a contributor. </font>
</ol>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks for you interest 
in EverQuest Express. </font>
