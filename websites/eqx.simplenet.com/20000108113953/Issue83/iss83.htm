   One month later, Kinory sat at a long table with Katha and surveyed the map spread before her.  It showed the layout of the rooms in which Lord Bayle would be staying, several suggested exits and entrances, and details of the guards, both those from the Freeport Militia and the Qeynos Guard.  A picture of the target lay nearby, depicting a stern-faced man of early middle age, white wings in his hair, a few wrinkles at the corner of his eyes.  Even allowing for the artist's flattery, a good looking man.

I’d always known that BlackBurrow was dangerous place.  I’d always ignored that fact.  One day, not too long ago, I learned just how dangerous BlackBurrow really was.  That was also the day I discovered what a true friend really is.  It all started one bright morning when I was a ranger of the 7<SUP>th</SUP> circle…

I'm not sure what all lead up to T'davens not-all-that-unexpected breakdown.  I recall his sister, T'danye, speaking to Gainam in the chapel one day.  It was an unusual place to see her, as she held little reverence for the sacred.  She believed in Innoruuk, and properly feared him, as we all do, but she was not one to visit his temples.

Flying on the plane, destination Vancouver for a huge annual Cisco Networkers convention, I started to think about what else?  EverQuest of course.  But this is not just another one of those praise Verant, thank God for EverQuest articles.  I decided to voice MY opinion (those of you who know me know I have one) of the con's I have seen with the latest smash hit.

Being a Necromancer had it disadvantages. Firstly the stigma attached to it provoked a hostile response in nearly everyone Alhazred met. Even his fellow Dark Elves were unsure at first. It was only when they listened to his greeting, the sonorous sound of his voice, that they recognised the true spirit within him. Where there once was a cold hate, now there was warmth and compassion. Something had changed Alhazred. Something had altered the whole course of his life. That something was not fate or circumstances or even the will of a god. It had flesh, blood, life and a name.  Rafiki.

	It was a calm, misty morning as I walked out of the Sleepy Willow Inn. A slow breeze whistled through the trees above me, as it began to slowly rain. Somewhere up above the forest the sun tried to penetrate the haze. I double-checked my supplies. I had enough food, water, and gold. I was rested. I breathed in the cool, damp air and walked to the lift that would lead me down from the Elf Tree City of Kelethin.

A day with Oghma
<br><br>
As many of you know, I am cursed with MCS - Multiple Character Syndrome.  I have, at current count, 30 different characters on 4 servers.  Many of them are in the 8th-12th level range, but I have a few that are higher, including my main Oghma character on the Karana server.  My main Oghma character is sort of a funny way to put it, really, since I leveled him to 14th in the first two weeks and haven't even looked at him since.  Players who were my level then are in their 40's now, which just goes to show that leveling must not be my main goal in EverQuest <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>.

I don't know if you've ever read the <a href="../credits/oghma.htm">dwarven mythos</a> I created on EQX, but I made an entity for most of the things that dwarves are known for - Mining, Smithing and of course - Greed.  Oghma has sort of always fought against the negatives, so it's surprising that it (greed) got to him.  All in all, though, he's only human (er, a dwarf :)) and subject to everything he was born with and ingrained into him.  Thanks for your well thought out answer, it's a good direction to go in if if comes up.
