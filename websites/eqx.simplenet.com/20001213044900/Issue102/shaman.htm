<em>Looking down on my hands, I saw they were no longer laced with the delicate tracings of scales, but were short and plump, with what looked like hair on them.  I was short, too, the ground nearer to my eyes, and it felt as though I had a heavy covering of hair on my chin.
<br><br>
Strange marks swam in front of my eyes, marks like the holy script of Veeshan, but different.  I could focus occasionally and see what these marks meant, but the concentration required almost made darkness close in on me too soon.  Finally, at the end of my strength, I saw a drawing appear on the table I must have been working at, and saw the outline of Kunark, and the outlines of another continent to the northwest.  I finally faded out.</em>
<br><br>
Sslytvyk walked back and forth around the silent body of the Holy One.  Young, strong, and already with a name for himself in battle, Sslytvyk was not blessed with the patience he knew was required of the Holy Guard.  The old priest had been kneeling there silent for three hours, his staff placed before him. Sslytvyk wanted to shake him awake, or to prod him to see if he was dead.  Why was he stuck with this Holy One, the one that didn't seem to do anything? Wandering from one lonely spot to the next, this Holy One seemed mostly to vacation in remote spots, instead of leading chants or conducting holy festivals. Sslytvyk had no idea why all the other Holy Ones even bothered with this one, though they seemed to give him more attention, even awe, when they were around him.
<br><br>
The Holy One suddenly jerked, his age then betrayed by the slowness of his movements.  "So, Sslytvyk, are you ready to head back to the Temple?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Yes, your Holiness, I am."
<br><br>
"Well then, let's not waste any more of your time.  I'm sure you need to practice and rest before your challenge to Hsslk."
<br><br>
Sslytvyk started, then held his features immobile silently.  Veeshan's claws! How did the old man always seem to make him ashamed?  How did he know about the challenge?  The Holy Guard were not supposed to fight among themselves, but the leadership of the squads were decided often by combat. Sslytvyk couldn't wait to get rid of this Holy One, and go back to serving as a soldier and not a bodyguard.
<br><br>
Slowly they walked back to the Temple, Sslytvyk helping the Holy One by occasionally steadying him as he walked over stones and large rocks.  He half wanted to pick the old man up and carry him, it was taking too long!  Finally, after an hour walk which would have taken him no less than ten minutes, they reached the Temple.
<br><br>
"I release you from my care," the Holy One said formally.  Sslytvyk bowed, and turned to hurry off.  "Hsslk's tail twitches left before he lunges.  Watch for it."
<br><br>
"Hunh?  Er, yes Holy One, thank you." Sslytvyk bowed again before leaving.  How did the old man know that?
<br><br>
Sslytvyk hastened to his room to grab his weapons and bandoleer.  The combat was scheduled in one hour and he was stiff from waiting and sitting with the old man.  He would have enough time to limber up and to a few practice bouts, then he would have to fight.  He felt oddly tired, like he had done more hard work then he had meant to.
<br><br>
The Holy One slowly walked to his chambers, and called for some wine.  He was worried about the amount of energy he had taken from Sslytvyk.  The young Iksar was strong, which is why the Holy One had requested him.  Tapping Sslytvyk's strength was vital to the task of seeing into the future, since the Holy One no longer had the power to do a Foreseeing on his own.  He had done a small foreseeing to choose which of the Holy Guard would be best suited for it, and it had chosen Sslytvyk.  Perhaps Veeshan had in mind great things for the young guard.  Time for some rest, then some pondering on the vision he had had.  Short, and hairy?  What could that mean? The Holy One hoped there were no side effects to the tapping he was not aware of…
<br><br>
Sslytvyk made the formal salute with his right hand blade and then stepped into the combat circle.  Hsslk had chosen a large two-handed sword for this combat, since Sslytvyk had a long reach.  Hsslk made the salute, and entered also.  A guard captain, their superior, hit a gong and the fight began.
<br><br>
Sslytvyk circled left, keeping his sword between himself and Hsslk. Hsslk circled too, looking for a chance to strike and score first blood.  All duels were to first blood, since the duels themselves, though ritualized by the combatants, were illegal.  The Holy Ones would ban any fighters from the Holy Guard if they found out. Sslytvyk feinted forward suddenly, and Hsslk parried his sword down, but not fast enough to riposte.
<br><br>
<em>What? I'm a lizard? Who is that?</em>
<br><br>
Sslytvyk staggered a bit.   A thought had come bursting into his mind, an alien thought, and it hit him like a blow.  Hsslk's lidless eyes narrowed, evaluating this development.  He feinted, to gauge Sslytvyk's reaction, and was hastily, though not surely, parried.
<br><br>
"Veeshan's lashing tail!  That was close!" thought Sslytvyk.  He was oddly tired again, as if his strength had been sapped.  He found a focus point and centered himself.  This fight was going to be difficult…
<br><br>
<em>A sword?  Where's my mace?  I've never used a thrusting weapon!</em>
<br><br>
Again came the thought, and with it a sense of a hairy, flat-nosed face, with what looked like a worried look. Sslytvyk staggered again, and saw Hsslk's eyes widen in comprehension.  This fight had to end soon, otherwise Hsslk would overcome him as he grew steadily more distracted and his strength was sapped.
<br><br>
Hsslk circled, looking more confident.  Sslytvyk knew he was watching for the next sudden stagger. Sslytvyk attacked, swinging rapidly, forcing the ever-watchful Hsslk to the edge of the circle.  He stepped back a bit.
<br><br>
<em>Brell help me!</em>
<br><br>
Sslytvyk staggered again, and Hsslk's eyes widened, and <em>his tail twitched</em>. Sslytvyk threw every ounce of his waning strength into the parry and riposte that followed, and the point of his sword tore into Hsslk's bicep.
<br><br>
"Blood!" called the captain. "Sslytvyk wins the challenge!"
<br><br>
<em>Bleary-eyed, I stumbled into the common room of the Freeport Inn, and sat down at the bar.  The night clerk stepped over and asked, "Can I help you, Oghma?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I think I need a brandy.  I just had the oddest dream…"</em>
