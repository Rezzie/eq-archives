Hi all
 <br><br>
Just wanted to tell you (the EQX 'staff') that you've just been added to my 'favorites menu'.
 <br><br>
Found you today (something like 5-6 hours ago) and I've been reading ever since.
 <br><br>
This post to tell you that the tale Zisstrik the Prophet by BloodWyrm is *GREAT*.
<br><br>
I hope it will go on and on - but then no - I wonna know how it ends - this is amazing stuff.
 <br><br>
And also someone writing as good as BloodWyrm must have done something commercial - books.
 <br><br>
Anyway you could let me know which writer I should be looking for - I've got to read more of his 'art'.
 <br><br>
Keep up the good work.
 <br><br>
Yours
 <br><br>

that he has the talent.]</em>

Thanks very much for using my idea for the <a href="../Issue33/expressions.htm">EXPRESSions</a>. I dare say you
have made my day. *Grins*
<br><br>
Now I have to go organize a game of Vampire, it sounds like fun...

BTW,
<br><br>
Tell Oghma that the story was too short!  It read so quick (i.e. it was
very good), that I finished it in no time.  Tell the next author we want
blood and gore (or gratuitous sex - his choice).  ;-)
