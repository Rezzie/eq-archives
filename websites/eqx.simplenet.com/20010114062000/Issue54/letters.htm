Another great issue!!
 <br><br>
The addition of the Rumors section is excellent and exactly what I had in mind.  The things you guys are doing with EQX are truly adding to the atmosphere of Norrath.  I could say many more things, but suffice it to say that each story was well done and a joy to read.
<br><br> 
I grow more and more excited to adventure with all of you in Norrath.

I am not sure which server Keafa may have been playing on in UO, but I take a slight bit of offense at the suggestion that there were NO "GOOD" players in UO.  From the first time I logged onto UO as SilverHawk until the last day I played the game, I have to say that my roleplaying constituted the very definition of a "GOOD" player.  Example:  I helped another "newbie" out that first day and ended the game six months later as the leader of a guild with that "newbie" as one of my top guildmates after he had CONSTANTLY harrassed me into creating a guild for "GOOD" players.  I agree that the hassels that were prevalant due to the PKing that was rampant in the game is what finally drove me away from it.  However,  the more I progressed in the game, the more I helped others out after they had been PK'ed and lost all their stuff.  Near the end of my playing time in UO, my bank box was loaded with nothing but items that could be used to assist someone out when they needed help.  I guess it is unfortunate that Keafa and I never met up in the game,  but to make a blanket statement that there were no "GOOD" players in UO is unsupportable at best.  The guild I ran was dedicated to helping others in any way possible to enjoy the game as much as possible.  NO, I AM NOT SOME KIND OF A SAINT.  I simply believe that if there is a way that I can assist anyone to enjoy the gaming environment, I will do it.  Print this or don't as you see fit.  I simply wanted to express the fact that there WERE some "GOOD" players out there and Keafa simply may not have encountered them.
