<br>

	Have you ever felt the despair of a broken heart? Do you know the pangs of unrequited love? Have you been willing to give up everything to be avenged of that disgrace? These are the questions asked by the acolytes of the Rathe, and eventually we must all answer them for ourselves.
<br><br>
	No one is born or christened to this god of broken hearts, but come to him in the hour of their greatest sorrow- the death of a beloved spouse, the rejection of a most desired lover, the betrayal of one who promised you eternal faithfulness. These are the lost souls that hear the call of the Rathe. A lone stairway graces an isle in Lake Rathetear, testament to a once powerful cult that made its home there. Among its ruins, you can find the story of the Rathe, and of an unrequited love that gave him strength beyond the grave.

	The story begins in the most ancient of times, and the true names of the Rathe in his mortal form in lost in that antiquity. The story tells of a most loyal a worthy paladin of Mithaniel Marr. Dedicated to the god from his birth, our paladin was relentless in his holy quest to honor his god and defeat his enemies. The people of Freeport held the paladin in their hearts as a great romantic figure, and many women wooed him. But the man would have no earthly distractions from his holy vows, and with great kindness, rejected the onslaught of advances. Soon enough, the brave man was forced to leave his home and temple to once again battle the forces of darkness.
<br><br>
	He found his path taking him into uncharted territory in the Southern plains of Karana. In his dreams, he was visited by visions of people being tortured at the hands of a group of trolls. Soon enough, the screams of the agonized woke him from his slumber, and he moved out to save the lost souls.
<br><br>
	He came upon the ghastly scene in the darkness of night, seeing several human children cowering in a corner while their captors used the bones of their parents to pick the scraps out of their teeth. Five trolls he could see, and felt that there maybe-another two were slumbering in the makeshift tents nearby. He said a quick prayer to the might of Mithaniel and then launched himself into battle. Two trolls fell to death immediately upon his blade, and he began to fight another when he heard the sound of cackling coming from where the children were being held. He turned and watched in horror as the faces of innocent human children transformed into the masks of blue evil known as the Teir'Dal. It was a trap, and now he was greatly outnumbered and overpowered by the legions of evil. Soon, a blow was struck that rendered him unconscious.
<br><br>
	This should have been the end of the loyal paladin, but the eyes of the gods are far seeing, and on that cursed night salvation was chosen over martyrdom. A great white light illuminated the area, burning the dark elves and trolls to death in its purity and goodness. That light was Erollisi Marr, sister goddess to Mithaniel.
<br><br>
	The paladin awoke the next morning to find himself not only alive, but being tended to by the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He grasped her hand and felt a rush of love and serenity that he had never before beheld. He began to speak to her of eternal devotion, love and loyalty. She smiled at him, but spoke no words. After several days, he was fit to travel, and the lady handed him his sword. He took it from her and then threw it onto the ground. He said that he would forsake his god and all that he held dear for one word of kindness from her lips. She smiled again, and told the paladin to return to the temple of her brother, Mithaniel. Then she vanished back into the light from whence she came.
<br><br>
	He stood there, dumbfounded. As he traveled back to Freeport, he pondered his situation. He was in love with a goddess, and he knew that he could never love nor serve another his lifetime. Once he was in Freeport again, the populace rejoiced. The hero was silent however, as he strode to the temple of Marr. They followed him all the while as he made his way to the temple gate. There he stopped, and turned and faced the crowd. He raised his sword high above his head. "Bear witness people of Freeport! I disavow myself of all allegiances to Mithaniel Marr, and will never raise my sword in battle again until I hear the call of his sister, Erollisi." With that said, he threw down his sword. The crowd stood aghast, and above the skies thundered.
<br><br>
	In the netherworlds of the gods, Mithaniel Marr's fist struck a table with a great thunderous boom. "Look at what you have done!" he cried to his sister who sat at the other end of the table. "My greatest of heroes, gone, lost because he fancies himself in love with you!" Erollisi smiled at her brother, "That was never my intention and you know it. I went to him and saved him from certain death at your request. Watch and see, dear brother, he will soon return to your light and valor when he sees that a goddess does not answer such a demanding call." Mithaniel nodded then, and the gods watched, and waited.
<br><br>
	Years passed, and the paladin never took up his sword again. He was eventually driven to drink and other unseemly sins, but never did his passion for Erollisi quell. He thought incessantly about her, even as Freeport became corrupted around him, even as the Tier'Dal and the evils of Innoruk infected the city.  He continued to wait for the goddess to rescue him from himself, to answer his love.
<br><br>
	Finally, with no true hero to save his city from itself, Mithaniel went to his sister again, and beseeched her to go to the paladin and ask him to take up the sword once more. She agreed, but told her brother that she would do it in her own way, to discover if this mortal was truly worthy of her love. "My brother, when I call you, come to me as we have discussed and we shall discover if love is truly blind." And with that, she vanished into the mortal realm.
<br><br>
	The paladin was brushing off the latest in his innumerable line of ales that day when a mysterious figure entered the tavern. A woman cover from head to toe in vibrant silks of many colors approached him. They began to talk, and talked for many hours. He enjoyed her company and soon the two were inseparable. Moonlight memories and long kisses of great passion filled their nights. They spoke of love and longing, and of devotion unsurpassed in the kingdom of man.
<br><br>
	After many months, the woman approached the paladin as he stood at the city gates, carrying a linen wrapped package under her arm. "My love," she whispered to him "I have found in you kindness and passion that I have never seen in the likes of any man. Take up your sword again for the might of Mithaniel and let us be married with his blessing and love." She unwrapped the sword from the linen and handed it to him. He took it tentatively and then cast it down unto the ground again. A dark shadow of painful memories crossed his face. "No!" he screamed at her, "My time with you was a lie. The only woman that will ever be worthy of my love or my sword is Erollisi! I will have no other, no one less." With that he turned away from her.
<br><br>
	Suddenly, the city torches were lit, warning of an impending invasion. None of the militia stood at the gates of the city all had vanished. A lone Tier'Dal warrior strode into the light. He raised his sword for battle, then lowered it at the woman- signaling that she would be the first to die by his blade.
<br><br>
	"My love" she cried, "Take up your sword and defend me from this fiend, for without your aid I surely die this night!" The dark elf moved towards them, his sword aimed at the woman the whole time.
<br><br>
	"Then die," spoke the paladin "For there is no love or life with out Erollisi."
<br><br>
	"Beloved" she screamed "For all that is kind and good, save me! Take up your sword!" The dark elf was upon her, and ran his blade through the woman even as she made a final plea to the paladin. The woman fell, and as she did the dark elf picked up the sword of the paladin from the ground.
<br><br>
	The Tier'Dal lowered the paladin's own sword to his neck. "Are you the next to die, and die by your own blade, human?" he sneered.
<br><br>
	The paladin looked into the face of the dark elf with no tears and replied "If that is the will of Erollisi."
<br><br>
	The dark elf smiled, and lowered the sword, turning to the corpse of the woman on the ground. "What say you Erollisi?" he said to the corpse. "Does this mortal die?" With that, a flash of light exploded around the Freeport gates, and the woman was transformed into Erollisi Marr and the dark elf into her brother Mithaniel.
<br><br>
	The paladin was dumbstruck, and fell instantly to his knees before the twin gods. His eyes were firmly fixed upon the ground as he heard the lips of the goddess pronounce his fate. "Oh Mithaniel, I grew to love him in my time here, and even though he forsaken me and our true love for his foolish dream, I cannot condemn him. Instead, let us banish him to the land where he should have died so many years ago. If after this, he wishes death, he must find it for himself."
<br><br>
	Mithaniel Marr nodded solemnly. "So be it sister." He handed his once prized paladin back his sword, and looked the mortal deep in the eyes. "That you were once loyal and brave and valorous to my cause, I thank you. That you expunged so much evil from my lands, I praise you. That you were too blind to see true love for what it is, I pity you. And for allowing a woman to suffer death when you could have saved her, be she goddess or stranger, I condemn you. Leave my city now and never return."
<br><br>
	The road to the realm of his banishment was a long one for the paladin, filled with regrets and anger. When he finally reached the valley that should have been his final resting-place so many long years ago, he began to cry. He cried until the day that he died, and by then, his tears had turned into a lake. But death was not the final resting-place for the once great paladin, instead upon his death he found that all his years of hate and longing had transformed him into a ghostly demi-god. From continents away he could hear the cries of the broken hearted and soon found himself answering those calls in the most hateful and revengeful of ways, and so was born the Rathe. He used his new found hate to destroy all those that found love in the name of Erollisi, and to aid those that felt that love should have been their prize. A mere spectre of the man that he once was, the Rathe still roams the lake of tears that bears his name- Rathetear, and the mountains where his cult found its first dark callings. Bloodstained stones tell the story of all too personal sacrifices to this bloody god, all in the name of love lost. 
<br><br>
	And even though eons of hate and malice have stained him, legend says that even the Rathe maybe redeemed, should he be able to see the light of Love again, Erollisi Marr. But the goddess will not venture into a land so filled with hate and pain some say. Others say that she has found another love; and still others say that she claims the Rathe as her mortal enemy- for all the hopes of love that he has destroyed over the years. Written in the stones of Rathetear is this story, and the story of so many that came when the Rathe called, to quench the pain of their own broken heart.
