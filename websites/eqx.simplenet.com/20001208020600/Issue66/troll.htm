She lay hidden behind thick foliage, blending into the forest like only a wood elf ranger could, her quick elven eyes keeping a close watch on the band of orcs despite the darkness.  She almost chuckled it was so easy.  The orcs, though quiet when moving through their forest home, had become noisy and boisterous now that they were near their target.  A fire burned in the small clearing where nine of them had made camp, heating the bodies of the orcs and making it even easier for her eyes to pick them out.  Their grappling hooks and climbing gear plainly stated their intentions to make a raid on the nearby treetop city of Kelethin.   
<br><br>
Her high elf companion began to whisper.  She silenced him with a quick motion of her hand.  Off to her left she heard the impatient rustlings of her third companion, a dwarf.  She held up a warning finger and he became still.  Her eyes quickly sought out the orc shaman who was searching through his pack muttering in the guttural orcish tongue.  Her eyes narrowed as he extracted a flask of ogre beer from his pack.  A grim smile crossed her face.  She watched as the shaman downed one, then two, then three gulps of the potent spirit.  She made the subtlest motion with of hand and her party tensed for action.  While keeping one eye on the shaman, she watched fire slowly collect in the hand of the high elf wizard and the dwarf silently unsheathe his sword and though she couldn't see him, she knew her fourth companion was readying his bow.  She turned her attention back to the shaman who had put away his flask and was know leaning against a tree staring glassy eyed into the sky, a sleepy smile was on his face.  The other orcs were absorbed in the three bats they where cooking over the open fire.  All was ready. 
<br><br>
She raised her hand.  Fire blazed across the clearing, reducing the startled shaman to ash as the dwarf bellowed a war cry and burst from his cover, sword held aloft.  From overhead a rain of arrows downed two of the orcs. The remaining raiders drew the swords and advanced on the dwarf, even as she exploded from the brush, sword poised.  She ran forward and attacked the astounded orcs from behind as the archer dropped from the trees.  The dwarf cut into the raiding party and an orcish head sailed across the clearing.  Though the orcs were reasonably strong their sword play was clumsy.  More fireballs wreaked havoc among the band.  The battle was over in a matter of seconds.  The only remaining orc dropped his weapon and surrendered, growling and spitting.  A well-placed blow to the back of his head crumpled the orc.  
<br><br>
"Tie him up and we'll bring him back to Kelethin." she murmured softly.  
<br><br>
"Lillyana that was fantastic!"  The high elf said excitedly.  Lillyana smiled graciously. 
<br><br>
"Thank you Dilaine."  She grinned fondly at him.  Dilaine was younger than her by several years and was easily impressed.
<br><br>
"Aaah, that was good but not as good as the raid I pulled off on the gnolls of Blackburrow," the dwarf rumbled.
<br><br>
"A compliment from you, Drock?  My, my, my, I must have done well."  She murmured with mock surprise.
<br><br>
"Yah, well, don't let it go to your head."  The dwarf grumbled.  "And what do you think."  He asked the second wood elf sharply, his black beard brisling.  The wood elf shrugged and said nothing.  The dwarf turned away in disgust and grumbled a variety of unflattering things about the elf, and elves in general.
<br><br>
"Now, now, Drock leave Jaldian alone" Lillyana chided gently.
<br><br>
"By Brell Serillis' beard he hasn't said more then four words since we began this expedition!" the dwarf shouted.
<br><br>
Abruptly, Lillyana made a cutting movement with her hand quieting Drock in mid tirade.  Lillyana held her head up, eyes scanning the forest and ears pricked.  Something wasn't right.  Dilaine gave a startled cry and Lillyana whirled around.  
<br><br>
Towering above them stood a monstrous eight-foot ogre, war hammer in hand.  Lillyana watched as power coursed to Dilaine's hands, but one blow from the hammer and the young wizard collapsed, the magic fizzling on his fingertips.  Jaldian fumbled for an arrow as Drock sprang forward to confront the ogre.  The ogre laughed contemptuously and picked up the dwarf with one hand.  The dwarf kicked and flailed with his sword to the further amusement of the ogre.  The massive fist lifted Drock towards the ogre's gaping mouth.  The dwarf suddenly got a grip on the sword and plunged it into the ogre's hand.  The monster bellowed in pain and threw the dwarf at a tree.  Drock hit the tree with such force that the wood cracked and he dropped to the ground with a dull thud.  The ogre licked his hand and then advanced on the wood elves a bloody smile on his lips.  Suddenly the ogre staggered back and fell to the ground with one of Jaldian's arrows sprouting from his eye.
<br><br>
"Go for help!"  Lillyana shouted, and after a moment's hesitation Jaldian plunged into the woods.  Lillyana turned to see to her companions but stopped as something hit the ground behind her.  She turned slowly and found Jaldian lying dazed on the ground.  Her eyes flicked from Jaldian to another ogre that was emerging from the wood.  She drew her sword and advanced on the brute.  The ogre looked at her, then at the crumpled body of his companion.  He bellowed in rage and sprang forward.  Lillyana raised her sword only to have it knocked out of her hand.  A hidden dagger dropped into her hand from her sleeve and she sprang out of the way as the ogre lunged with his hammer. She managed to knick him on the shoulder as he moved past her and she grunted in surprise.  Ogre hide was tougher than she had imagined.  
<br><br>
The ogre took advantage of her momentary to surprise to enclose her hand in his massive fist, crushing the dagger out of her hand.  The ogre hoisted her up in front of his face and looked at her with his red pig like eyes.
<br><br>
"Elfie gonna be sorry for killen Thuk's bruder" he said hideously.  He smacked his lips and spit landed on Lillyana's forehead.  Her face screwed up into an expression of the most profound disgust and she landed one well-placed kick to the ogre's stomach.  The ogre grunted in surprise and dropped her.  Lillyana scurried back towards the tree where Drock lay and tried to grab the dwarf's sword with her crushed fingers.  She heard the ogre laughing behind her and prepared herself for the worst.  She turned slowly and looked up defiantly as the monster lumbered towards her.  
<br><br>
Suddenly a series of heavy thuds shook the ground underneath her.  From across the clearing a troll exploded from the trees and flew through the air, his arms outstretched, axes held in both hands. The troll hit the ground with a resounding crash.  The monstrous figure smashed the ogre in the face with the flat of his axe.  The ogre stumbled back and crashed into a tree, knocking it over.  Lillyana looked up at the green-skinned troll.  Smaller than the ogre, he still towered over her. The axes were so large even a barbarian would be forced to wield them two-handed.  A rag tag collection of rusty plate and chain armor gave off a dull gleam in the dawn light.  The ogre slowly clambered to its feet and Lillyana realized that except for a helmet and sleeves, the ogre was wearing a full suit of plate mail.  Thuk gave the troll a hurt look.
<br><br>
"What for troll bash Thuk?" the ogre asked.  Lillyana saw the trolls face light up a little at the word "bash."
<br><br>
"Ogre leave now, leave tree elfs, dwarf and snot elf," the troll grunted.
<br><br>
"Who you what say what Thuk do?" the ogre demanded.
<br><br>
"Gorch say what Thuk do."  The troll countered menacingly.  Lillyana noted that this was apparently not good enough for Thuk, who roared in rage and ran at the troll.  The troll neatly dodged the ogre with a speed surprising for his size.  Lillyana watched this battle of titans in awe.  The ogre was definitely bigger, but the troll seemed to be able to move quicker.  The two brutes rained blow after blow down on each other, the ogre's war hammer putting massive dents in Gorch's armor, while the troll's axes were slowly cutting the ogre out of his armor.  The clearing rumbled with the footsteps of these giants.  Lillyana remained frozen against the tree, unable to cross the clearing for fear of being crushed and not being able to melt into the forest and leave her friends.  
<br><br>
Finally, she saw that the ogre was slowing down and getting clumsy.  She knew the end of the battle was near.  She didn't know what was worse: getting eaten by the ogre or having to deal with the troll.  Suddenly the battle ended.  With a wet thud the ogre's head hit the ground, followed by the rest of his body.  Once again Lillyana slowly got to her feet, preparing to defend herself and her friends to the last.  The troll turned and looked down at her with faintly glowing purple eyes
<br><br>
"Elf okay?" the troll grunted.  Lillyana blinked in surprise and looked up at the troll dumbfounded.  "Eeelllf ookaay?"  Gorch repeated speaking very slowly and carefully.  Lillyana looked at the troll suspiciously.
<br><br>
"I'm fine" she stated flatly.  She continued to keep an eye on the troll.
<br><br>
"Tree elf okay?"  Gorch asked and gestured back towards Jaldian, who was slowly starting to get up.  Lillyana's eyes widened, she had completely forgotten about her companions.  She ran to Dilaine's crumpled form.  She gave him a quick check over he seemed to be all right, nothing a good cleric couldn't fix anyway.  She quickly summoned some of her own limited healing magics and dealt with the more major injuries.  The high elf's eyes fluttered open and he smiled when he saw her kneeling over him.  She smiled back, and then moved over to where Jaldian was leaning against a tree rubbing his head.  Jaldian noted Lillyana's hand wound and healed it wordlessly.  The broken bones mended themselves and the bruised flesh vanished. Lillyana wiggled her fingers as feeling returned to them.  Jaldian smiled at her then looked up and saw troll.  He backed up quickly and putting his back to a tree reached for his weapon.  Lillyana put her hand on his sword arm, stilling him.
<br><br>
"I think it's ok," she murmured reassuringly.
<br><br>
"Elf okay?"  Gorch rumbled.  Jaldian nodded his head quickly.  "Good."  Gorch replied and sat down in the middle of the clearing.  Jaldian and Dilaine walked cautiously over to Drock, keeping a wary eye on the troll who continued to sit watching them expressionlessly.  Lillyana observed that at some point during the fight the captured orc had escaped. 
<br><br>
"Why did you do that, why did you help us?"  Lillyana asked as she slowly approached the troll.
<br><br>
"Snot elf okay?"  The troll inquired pointing at Dilaine.  Lillyana stifled a laugh at that partially accurate description of the high elf stereotype.
<br><br>
"He's fine, why did you help us?"  She asked again.
<br><br>
"Gorch likes elfs," he shrugged.
<br><br>
"I see."  Lillyana murmured.  She noticed that the troll had a large black bruise over his eye.  The wood elf decided to take a chance.
<br><br>
"You want me to heal that for you?"  Gorch touched the bruise and winced slightly.  He looked at Lillyana suspiciously.
<br><br>
"It gonna hurt?"  He asked, his hand shielding his head.
<br><br>
"It won't hurt, I promise." Lillyana soothed.  Gorch winced again as his massive hand brushed the injured skin.  He nodded, slowly taking his hand away.  Lillyana held her hand out over the bruise and channeled her magic.  Small blue sparks fell from her hand and the injury began to give off a soft blue glow.  The bruise shrank and shrank until it was gone.  Gorch gingerly touched his domed head and then gave his bald scalp a good rub.  Satisfied, he got to his feet, a smile slowly spreading across his face.
<br><br>
"I Gorch."  he said proudly while thumping his chest.
<br><br>
"I'm Lillyana, the ah, high elf is called Dilaine and the wood elf is Jaldian, and the dwarf is named Drock" She replied, gesturing at her companions.  Gorch looked over and Dilaine waved meekly, Gorch waved back exuberantly.
<br><br>
"Lilly nice, fixed Gorch.  I got bashed good."  Gorch said, turning back to Lillyana.  Dilaine called for Lillyana softly.  She excused herself politely and walked over to the high elf. He beckoned her closer and the two moved their heads close together.
<br><br>
"Do you have any mana left?"  He whispered worriedly.
<br><br>
"No, why" Lillyana murmured back.
<br><br>
"Neither does Jaldian, and Drock needs healing."  Dilaine gestured at Drock who now lay propped against a tree still unconscious.  Jaldian, who was kneeling beside him, gave the two elves a worried look.  "He should be okay providing we can get him to Kelethin." Dilaine finished, turning to look apprehensively at the troll.
<br><br>
"Dwarf okay?" Gorch asked anxiously.
<br><br>
"Yes, but only if we can get him to Kelethin" Lillyana replied.
<br><br>
"You go to tree town?"
<br><br>
"Yes"
<br><br>
"Good, Gorch go there too."  The big troll said with a note of finality.  He lumbered over to where Drock lay unconscious.  Gorch picked the dwarf up carefully then lay him over his shoulder.  He started to walk into the woods towards Kelethin, then turned back to the astounded party.
<br><br>
"Elfs coming?"  Gorch asked, a smile spreading across his ugly face.  The elves scampered after him as he trudged into the Faydark.
