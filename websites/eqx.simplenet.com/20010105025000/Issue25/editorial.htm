<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 25!</font></p>
<p align="justify">
Things are changing quickly for me.  EQX seems to be taking up more and more
of my time.  I don't mind too much, but I can't trade my gaming time for EQX
time, so I lose out on sleep.  It should be easier to kill me in Tanarus
(like THAT was tough before) as I play with my eyes closing.
<br><br>
But as I spend more time working on this paper, I realize how little
attention I have been giving it.  Sure, I edit (mostly just read) a few
pages of print each week.  And I have to spend a few hours fiddling around
with HTML and ftp and all that.  And it's been enough work.  But I've been
glossing over the details.  The stuff that an editor is actually supposed to
do.  Like make sure that his facts are straight…
<br><br>
Last week I babbled a bit about game systems and game worlds.  I wrote it
because it was on my mind while I was writing.  Not because I had put any
thought into it.  And, as can be said frequently about me, I didn't
necessarily know what the heck I was talking about.
<br><br>
I received a letter from Eric Rowe with Chaosium.  That sorta stunned me a
bit in the first place.  But that he was writing to correct an error or two
of mine was no surprise to me at all.  Here's most of what he said:
<br><br>
<em>Alan,
<br><br>
Thanks for responding. The main inaccuracy is that Chaosium Inc. does
not own Glorantha and is not involved in the creative part of
publishing Hero Wars.  Chaosium will be doing pre-press and
distribution of the product, but all things Gloranthan will be coming
from Issaries, Inc. A short synopsis of Issaries, Inc. can be found in
the latest InQuest magazine, or by visiting
<a href="http://www.glorantha.com">http://www.glorantha.com</a>.
<br><br>
As to the Hero Wars system not having enough detail, did your friend
mention that with the survey response forms we distributed a letter
from me stating that this was just the basic system, and that a large
amount of detail and rules were still to be added? I wrote it just to
avoid comments like those in your editorial. Your friend might not
have gotten a copy of the letter (naughty GM), or just forgot. Either
way, I assure you that Hero Wars will have a rule system that is not
Amber. The primary reason for the early playtesting was to get out and
see if the look-and-feel of the core system worked, and from the vast
majority of responses it did, excellently.
<br><br>
Anyway, we got about 30 people (in three days) visiting our Glorantha
site from your editorial link. So people are actually reading what you
have to say (and forcing me to make sure it is accurate).  </em>[short snip here
to keep his e-mail address away from you people :) ]<em>
<br><br>
Cheers,
<br><br>
Eric Rowe<br>
Chaosium Inc.</em>
<br><br>
See, I goofed.  And I think I actually knew that Issaries, Inc. was in charge
of Glorantha.  I just didn't check my facts.  I will attempt to prevent this
in the future.  My apologies to our readers, and to Eric.  And I was very
happy to see that so many of you actually went and checked it out!  I know
that you found it to be as cool as I did.  I can't wait to see the final
product.
<br><br>
Well, perhaps next weeks I'll go back to my mindless ramblings.
