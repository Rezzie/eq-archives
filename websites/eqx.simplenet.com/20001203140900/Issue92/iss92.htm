    "Ye gods!" said Katha irritably as they topped another rise and saw more trees before them.  The forest had thinned out slightly in the past hour, and they had all begun to hope that it meant an end to their cold wet trek cross-country.  But now, looking out across the land laid out in front of them, Kinory realized that the forest went on for leagues yet.  She scrubbed a hand through lank, dirty hair, and turned to Daryth.

Dusk.
<br><br>
The triumph of darkness over the retreating light. The passing of lights influence over the land. When the balance between good and evil begins its shift.
<br><br>
Soon shadows will populate the grounds, multiplying with each heartbeat. Darkness will once again triumph over the weakening light, releasing the servants of night.

This sure feels like a cheap way to write an article.  Ask people to give their opinions and then fill the article with 'em.  Hardly any work for me.  But I'll do my best to be witty and rational, and to try to fill my word quotient for the week.
<br><br>
In <a href="../Issue87/etiquette.htm">issue 87</a> I described and experience, a bad one, in which a player broke several 'rules of etiquette'.  It occurred to me near the end of the article (no, I don't plan most of the things I write, I just type and see what comes out - that's why I'm not getting paid to do this) that I probably have a different set of rules than the rest of you do<b>...</b>

So what's next?  Ultima Online was a success.  EverQuest is a hit.  So what's next for this genre?  Asheron's Call?  Well, despite what they say, it's not going to be all that different than the rest.  I'm eagerly awaiting Neverwinter Nights.  I've heard the good reviews about the company, and I've read some of the promises about what it will be.  But it's still a fantasy based game, and not even a massive mulit-player one at that (though I think it's just for that reason that I'm so interested in it).  No, I mean what's next, after the fantasy fetish dies down?

When I was reading Tales of Truth part one, written by Taean, it gave me the
shivers. I must say that I really like that story and Im looking forward to
the next part. Thank you for a great site, you are doing a great job.
