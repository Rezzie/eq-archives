So the next day I go to work. I’ve had zero sleep, and I’m wishing I could log back in long enough to get that one last level.
<br><br>
Finally four o’clock comes.  I race out to the parking lot, fly the forty-five minutes home, and throw all my stuff down, and push the power switch on the Pentium II 366 MHz machine with 128 MB Ram.  <em>Ok, I lied, just wanted to make you drool. It’s only a P200 with 32 megs.</em>
<br><br>
This routine will last though out the remainder of the beta.  Hopefully I find some time to schedule sleep in there somewhere.

<b>FINAL RELEASE:</b>
<br><br>
After enough beta phases have been accomplished, and the DEV Team is satisfied that the code is stable, and ready, the game will go gold.  Millions of anxious adventurers will rush to the stores to purchase their copy.  <em>I, of course, will have had mine pre-ordered, shipped UPS red label, the day of release.</em>
<br><br>
I rip open the box, and install.  Once the installation is completed I log onto one of the many servers available.  There is a mad craze of players racing around trying to become accustom to their new surroundings.  The citizens are actually helpful to one another, as everyone is ecstatic about the New World we waited so long to become apart of.

The beta testers, being more experienced, are usually the first to advance.  I’ll probably join up with my guild to adventure to known locations that contain items I need for my inventory.
The gaming experience begins here!
