<em>Preface -</em>
<br><br>
THE SECOND AGE:&nbsp; The Golden Age after the creation of the world, and before the appearance of Men.
<br><br>
TUNARIA - A large continent on the world of Norrath. Most sentient races of that hemisphere have their genesis in Tunaria. At this time the land is occupied by the High Elves in the southeastern regions and the Dark Elves directly north of them. The Dwarves reside overseas in a mountain kindgom, but hill Dwarves are said to have existed in the region of the Serpent Spine Mountains. The Kerra , a catlike people, are dominant on the plains of Karana and on Odus (in those days known as Tamyrhh). The magnificent Kedge at this time thrived in the Ocean of Tears and elsewhere.
<br><br>
ILLIANTH - The Kingdom of the First Elves during the Second Age, consisting of the eastern Elddar Forest in the lands of Tunaria (In later ages the land became known as "Antonica")
<br><br>
THE ILLIANIDES - The High Elves native term for themselves.
<br><br>
THE TIER ILLIA - Elven for "High Elves"
<br><br>
THE TIER DAL - Elven for "Dark Elves"
<br><br>
CORSANTH:&nbsp; The ancient capital of Illianth. Ruled by the elven demigods until it's fantastic fall at the end of the Second Age. It was swallowed in the great cataclysms ending that era, and now lies beneath the Ocean of Tears.
<br><br>
TAKISH-HIZ:&nbsp; Old capital of Illianth when the kingdom was jointly ruled with Corsanth. Takish-Hiz was actually founded sometime at the end of the First Age, and was ruled by elven demigods until the middle of the Second Age. It was from Takish that the dark god Innoruuk stole the seeds that he created his Dark Elven nation from. After the abduction of the king and queen by Innoruuk, Takish-Hiz fell from grace. Tunare abandoned the city and it became cursed. Currently, the city is a ghost town, and the elves banish criminals and exiles to her lonely embrace.  At the end of the Second Age Takish-Hiz disappeared with Corsanth. Some suspect it lies beneath the deserts of Ro, somewhere near the Oasis of Marr.
<br><br>
WINDWALKER:&nbsp; The Legendary Elven Journeyman of the late Second Age. His true name is unknown. Windwalker became the cheif avatar of Tunare during the terrible wars with the Children of Veeshan, the Fore-Beasts. At this time the land of Illianth was besieged by war on the southern shores, and divided amongst the High Elves, the Dwarven Hill Kingdoms, and the sinister Tier-Dal. Men had yet to appear in Norrath. The High Elves vie for power with the Fore-Beasts, the Fathers of Dragonkind.  The Gods walked freely on Norrath at this time, and made frequent appearances--some not so friendly

<br><br>
<b>NORTHBOUND</b>
<br><br>

THE FACE OF WAR had never changed, not for him...
<br><br>
WINDWALKER, the South's great Hero, faces peril on the North Coast. Gorgonoth, the Black Dragon Prince has landed in the Elven lands. The armies of King Ausar march to meet the Terror at the towers of Iseline, west of the Serpents Spine. With them is the Windwalker, cloaked and quiet save at the behest of Myrtelis, his old friend and comrade. The armies pass by the quaint village of Cerone, dwarfing the community like an army of white ants over the emerald plains of Karana. 
<br><br>
  Presently, the good general adjusted his visor against the chill winds from the north. The hard breeze fluttered the golden banner of Corsanth, and the bright sun blazed the standard like a heavenly beacon. Myrtelis scowled at the wind. It was cold and lifeless, and quite unnatural in the eternal springtime of Illianth. It was from Gorgonoth. The icy breath was a gray foreshadow. 
<br><br>
"I do say, the Terror is still many leagues off correct?" Syrtis Myrtelis' tribune asked. He looked toward the north apprehensively.
<br><br>
"My seers have told me it tarries at the coast. And the villagers here haven't seen it yet. In this flat land we would see it from aways."
<br><br>
"And if Gorgonoth takes to the clouds and flies to Corsanth?"
<br><br>
"It cannot fly, so Windwalker told me, for great distances. It is too big. We may set upon it while it rests."
<br><br>
Syrtis raised a brow at the mention of the journeyman, "And where does this cleric tarry? I haven't seen him amongst us for days."
<br><br>
Myrtelis shook his head, "No mortal can say where Windwalker tarries out of sight, so he is named such. Pray he appears at the moment of reckoning." 
<br><br>
So the armies marched, numbering five thousand from old Corsanth, five thousand from youthful Felwithion, and the five hundred Dwarven engineers from Kaladim in the Far East. And where Windwalker tarried during the march none could say. He was there at the outset in Corsanth, when King Ausaar commissioned him to Myrtelis. Yet one night when passing near Nektulos he had come to Myrtelis out of the shadows.
<br><br>
"I must depart for seven days, Commander." a lithe, serpentine voice whispered from the shadowy threshold of the Generals quarters. There was no compromise in the statement.
<br><br>
Myrtelis turned toward the voice, marking only pale silver discs staring at him from beneath a gray hood. 
<br><br>
"This is a sudden change old friend. What business calls you away from the needs of Corsanth?"
<br><br>
Windwalker approached from the doorway and pulled back his hood. The ancient eyes had not lost their luster in the dim candlelight of the tent. The face wasn't youthful, it was ageless and the weight of his years was apparent through the wistful arch of his silvery brow. 
<br><br>
Presently he sat down on one of Myrtelis' thickly padded den chairs. He seemed slightly out of place, like an iridescent ghost.
<br><br>
"No affair could lure me away from the needs of my kingdom. I seek a way to save the armies of Ausar and Felwithion."
<br><br>
Myrtelis bristled at this, "Save us, you say?"
<br><br>
The Elven cleric nodded rather grimly, "If you face him as you are, even with my presence, you all will be ashes."
<br><br>
Windwalker paused, as if he had said something he regretted. Glancing back at Myrtelis' rigid face he continued solemnly.
<br><br>
"I have met Gorgonoth."
<br><br>
The General's blood turned cold at those words, for he saw the memory of it in the Elven clerics colorless eyes.
<br><br>
"It was quite a time ago, under the rule of Ausar's great ancestor Baradyne. Baradyne's son had led an expedition to a land called Velious, and had found a glacier with some sort of animal frozen inside. The fool had it hewn out of the ground and brought aboard his ship. Halfway home in the middle of the sea it partially thawed, and when the sun reached it, the beast awoke. Needless to say that was the end of the good prince and his fleet. Gorgonoth, vengeful of the gods who imprisoned him, reeked havoc upon the shores of Illianth, much as he is doing today. I was sent to parley with it, and the endeavor was one I would not choose to repeat."
<br><br>
Myrtelis saw the Cleric pause, and waited on his next word. When none came he asked, "You defeated it?"
<br><br>
Windwalker smirked, "General, if I defeated it then, you and I wouldn't be here now.
<br><br>
"No, then my power would not have been equal to the task. But then I had the Seraphim. I drove it into the sea where it has been for five centuries."
<br><br>
"The Seraphim?" Myrtelis did not recognize the name.
<br><br>
"Yes, that which presents itself only as you need it. Quite an artifact as I remember it."
<br><br>
Yet Windwalker told the General but a little more, save that the Gorgonoth possessed eyes and ears in every shadow, and to say more was the jeopardize the quest. And then he was gone, into the shadowy mists of Nektulos--the haven of the dark elves, to seek whatever ancient mystery the Elves of the wood concealed. And soon the army reached the mountains on the west, and meant to hide in the valleys Rathe until Gorgonoth set down to rest.
<br><br>
The waning sun hung over the elven lands to the east, staring wistfully at the elven army perched on a steep cliff side overlooking the Rathian bluffs. Myrtelis chose Andreyas, a scion of the lower elven houses of Felwithion and his favored lieutenant, to lead a squad of 12 rangers to the plains to spy on Gorgonoth. The brash but intelligent young soldier was all too eager to accept.
<br><br>
"Go with Tunare's hand up your shoulder, son of Andalason." Myrtelis had said to the commander in parting. Andreyas nodded and began to mount his horse, when Myrtelis brought him close and whispered, "Do not say Veeshan's name within sight of the beast, for it holds the memory of its father very dear. Warn your men of the same."
<br><br>
Andreyas clutched the General's arm warmly and nodded. With a parting smile Andreyas mounted his tall steed and said in his windy elven lisp, "Beast's that carry honor for their fathers? I believed the elves alone were civilized enough for such courtesy."
<br><br>
Myrtelis replied, "Young fool, that race to which that beast belongs taught the elves such courtesy. Approach him with haste."
<br><br>
Andreyas bowed his head respectfully, and with a sly grin--the twelve mounted elves rode off to the plains. 
<br><br>
On the third day of their journey, about 10 leagues south of the Chydler Lagoon (in later ages it was know as Lake Neriuss) they found a heap of fawn carcasses on a patch of blasted earth, and a footprint.  Andreyas descended from his horse and examined the blackened bones. He kicked at a deer skeleton and it collapsed into dust. 
<br><br>
One of the rangers nodded, "The white fire did this."
<br><br>
"The footprint is wide but not very deep." Another elf said, kneeling next to the huge crater in the ground. "An elephant could roll twice in this hole."
<br><br>
Andreyas thought but a moment before drawing his conclusion.
<br><br>
"Gorgonoth was flying, from the lake. Possibly he had just gotten a drink. He spotted a herd of fawn on the plain. He dived swiftly, his shadow scattering most of the animals. He released his fire on the slower ones, incinerating them. His momentum carried him low, and one of his claws brushed the ground before he could climb again. Thereafter he continued on his bearing toward the northern coast."
<br><br>
Andreyas knelt on the scorched earth and grabbed two fingerfuls of carbonized soil. Sniffing it slightly he let it fall between his fingertips. He nodded triumphantly, looking determinedly to the north, "he was here just yesterday."
<br><br>
One of Andreyas companions said, "Then he rests just south of the Jaggedpines. Twenty leagues north."  The twelve elves mounted and were about to fly after the trail, when the chill wind hit them.
<br><br>
"Could that be it's breath, or the vortex of it's wings?" one of the rangers asked.
<br><br>
"The icy wind may seem like a terrible sign, but that is its weakness. It comes from its subtle stirrings in deep sleep. We may ride upon it now when it is unprepared." Andreyas replied. The others nodded in agreement, but their faces grew apprehensive. Voices seemed to carry in the wind.
<br><br>
As the twelve elven rangers rode North to Destiny, the elven journeyman Windwalker entered the forest of Nektulos, where Innoruuk's minions dwelled. 
<br><br>
Upon entering the twisting thickets of that morbid shire, Windwalker whispered a mantra to Tunare. His ghostly visage dimmed and evaporated under the pale sunlight, he was invisible. The woods seemed to suddenly grow quiet, as if aware of his presence. But Windwalker betrayed no sound, save the light rustle of his footfalls on the leaves that were no louder then the gentle winds.
<br><br>
Windwalker sought an old friend, and old memories reawakened.
<br><br>
In the ancient of days, when Windwalker was known under his birth-name, the elven courts of Illianth were in the midsts of a golden age. The twin cities of Corsanth and Takish-Hiz stood like gleaming pearls on the emerald breast of Tunaria. There was no mar or flaw in nature's eternal springtime, and the horrors of Veeshan's loins still slept silent beneath the frozen wastes of Velious. 
<br><br>
Windwalker was a youthful prince of the royal house of Takish-Hiz. His father, the elven Demi-god Sah-Thiori was a son of Tunare and divine king of the elven lands. His mother Queen Lotrys was a woman of exceeding beauty and wisdom. The gods of light held banquets with elves, and shared the knowledge of magic and sciences when the rest of Norrath was under the shadow of darkness.
<br><br>
Unknown to the High Elves, jealous eyes looked upon their splendor from the heavens in fury.  One day, while Sah-Thiori was holding audience in his palace, a dark hooded man came before him.  "Greetings good sir." Thiori said to the man warmly, "I trust that Tunare has continued to grant you long life."
<br><br>
The hooded man stood crouched, face obscured in the dark shadows of his cowl. He did not answer or even acknowled the king's presence.
<br><br>
Thiori glanced at his eldest son, Elron, who looked at the shadowy figure with apprehension.
<br><br>
"You stand before the Elven Presider Sah-Thiori. Son of Tunare and father of Illianth! Speak your business sir." Elron's tone was harsh and firm.
<br><br>
The figure did not seem to respond at first, then he raised a bony, knarled finger at the king. The royal guard surrounded Thiori, fearing a spell. But only dry, cracked woods came.
<br><br>
"Tunare is the whore of Norrath, and the elven nations are her pale bastards. That name holds no power over one such as myself."
<br><br>
Elron, Windwalker, and the youngest son Eldebarr all whipped out their swords, along with the rest of the royal guard. The blasphemous words almost incensed the elves to cut the figure down in sight of the king.  Thiori was visibly taken aback by the insolence, "I know not who you think you are sir, but I will grant you this mercy. Leave my court and never return, for if you do that day will be your last."
<br><br>
Before Thiori could finish his words, the hooded figure bellowed a mocking, dry laughter. 
<br><br>
"Do not dictate terms to me young fool. My life is not for you to give or take!"
<br><br>
Thiori stood from his jade throne and gestured to the guard, who eagerly leaped at the figure, blades bared. The dark figure made a gesture, and the entire legion of the royal guard were tossed like leaves in the wind. Pinned against the walls and ceiling of the chamber, the people screamed in horror. Elron charged the dark sorcerer but hit an invisible wall and was knocked unconscious. Sah-Thiori's anger flared, and from his outstretched hand a flaming red ball of flame plummeted toward the sorcerer. The dark figure caught the fireball in his bare hand, then tossed it at the people staring in stunned horror. The crowd burst into sickening flame. Windwalker's anger overcame his shock, and he sliced at the figure with his scimitar. Just before his blade would have beheaded the man, his arms locked and froze. The man turned around, siezing Windwalker by the throat with a single hand and lifting him off the ground. Amber eyes glowed stoically from beneath the hood.
<br><br>
"Sah-Eruon?" the figure said as he looked at Windwalker's struggling form, "your destiny doesn't lie with me young one. But I have great plans for your royal folk. Great plans."
<br><br>
He tossed Windwalker across the chamber, into a pillar--knocking him into oblivion. As Windwalker passed in and out of consciousness, he saw the dark figure approach his parents, who did not seem to attempt to escape him. The dark figure withdrew his cowl, and on their faces dawned grimly recognition. From Sah-Thiori's parted lips Windwalker read one word, a word that he had never heard before, but would never again forget.
<br><br>
"Innoruuk"
<br><br>
Sah-Thiori and Queen Lotrys, taken by the the dark god Innoruuk. Tortured for a thousand years, to become the forebearers of the Teir-Dal.
<br><br>
The Dark Elves.
<br><br>
"Greetings Sah-Eruon."
<br><br>
Windwalker nodded. He stood before an entire legion of Dark Elves. They stood guard before the darkened gates of Neriak, realm of the Tier-Dal. 
<br><br>
They knew what Windwalker was here for. They knew he sought the Seraphim.
<br><br>
Windwalker smiled slyly before them. He was with family.
<br><br>
"Greetings, my brothers."
