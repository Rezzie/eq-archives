Unlike Oghma, I haven't been playing much at all these last few weeks.  Primarily due to the holidays and the wonderful illness that I caught that allowed me to spend the last week at home in bed.  But I should have known better.  After all, I had the week off.  I'm always sick on vacation days.
<br><br>
I'm feeling quite a lot better now, thanks.  And, of course, I got to go in to work today to make sure that nothing was aflame.  It wasn't, so at least all of the running around that we did preparing for this day over the last six months feels justified.  Yeah for the home team.
<br><br>
I know that I'll get yelled at if I go into details (hell, I wasn't even allowed to take pictures), but I got to meet some folks in person this weekend (while on the leading edge of my hideous fever - a fact that seemed lost on those folks), people that I've known on-line for a long time now.  I've done this a few times.  Each time that I've met in person someone that I've known only through electronic conversations, I'm shocked.  The shock comes later, though.  The first thing is the awkwardness.  It's not the uneasiness that comes from meeting a stranger for the first time.  There are no real expectations there.  And most of the time when you meet a stranger you can expect to lose nothing if they don't like you.  Meeting people that you call friends though you can't describe them well enough to the waitress so that she can tell you if they've come in the restaurant or not, that awkward.  Maybe it's just me, or maybe it's just that I'm willing to admit it, but I always feel like meeting in person is a really great chance for me to ruin a friendship.  In person I might say something truly stupid, something that I can easily avoid with a bit of self-editing when typing.
<br><br>
The shock tends to come when I find out what they're really like.  Sometimes I'm shocked by how wrong my preconceptions were.  Often I'm shocked by how right I was...
<br><br>
I'm tempted to talk a long while about the oddities of meeting these people, but it wouldn't be nearly as much fun without talking specifics, and that's something that I'll avoid.  It seems to be one of the unspoken rules for me.  I get to meet a lot of cool people from the net, but I can't talk about them in a public forum like this.  I'm not allowed to chat about quirks, or how damn much some of them can drink without passing out or...  any of that stuff.  Too bad, really.  I'll just say, thanks guys, it was a lot of fun!  Next time I'll be more fun and less sick, I promise.
<br><br>
But I did want to talk about the passion for the game that they showed me.  Intelligent, funny people that really enjoy playing EverQuest.  Sure, they see things wrong with it.  They've got some bright ideas about how to make it better, and a few harsh things to say about what has been done.  They've got complaints and ideas.  But they've also got a way of enjoying the hell out of the game.  Their outlook was just fantastic.  All of the tales, told while trying to withhold laughter, were about how much fun they had.
<br><br>
I wish all players were like that.  I wanna thank you guys for showing me that the game is fun, despite...  despite everything.
<br><br>
And happy new year to you all.  So far, so good for me.  I've already put in an hour at work this year and nobody got hurt!
