Well it's Halloween... and I have yet to come up with a spooky story.  Horror is a genre which I really haven't enjoyed much, despite reading all of H.P. Lovecraft.  I think that real life is scary enough, why should I go and try to scare myself <b>on purpose</b>?  I just can't see doing it…
<br><br>
Unfortunately for players in my campaigns, however, that is not the case.  I perpetrated on my adventuring group quite a scare using the old TSR adventure "The Village of Hommlet".
<br><br>
For those of you who haven't ever played it, here is a synopsis:  Outside the Village of Hommlet exists an old ruined castle, which adventures find ripe for the picking, a sort of beginners dungeon.  Unbeknownst to them, an evil cleric resides in the very lowest level, and with his band of evil men and undead followers, has been enriching his churches coffers with bandit raids.  The cleric, Lareth, has spies in the Village and elsewhere to keep up-to-date on happenings and caravans.
<br><br>
My group of adventurers was quite the above average group; they had discovered Lareth's band's existence, and, with two rangers, attempted to infiltrate it.  On their way to that discovery, however, they had lost a couple of characters due to standard dungeon deaths.  The two rangers went on a raid with their new "boss", but couldn't actually take part in the killing, and ran away when they had gotten enough information.  Lareth sent a couple of ghouls after them to hunt them down, and the ghouls killed one of the rangers.  The party went to town to stock up for the showdown battle, and Lareth was told through his spies in town.
<br><br>
The party found the dungeon home of Lareth empty, save for a few guardian undead which they quickly dispatched.  Scrounging around the lair, they discovered a clue which unmasked the identity of the in-town spy.  Using truth spells, they discovered the location of Lareth's new camp.
<br><br>
With the remaining ranger in the party, they tracked their way to the camp and attacked it.  In the first wave of attacks they took out the live sentries before the undead contingent was upon them.  Suddenly, they realized, they were up against no ordinary foe!
<br><br>
"Whyyyy arrrreeee yooouuuu atttacckinng meeee?" asked the zombie body of their dead ranger friend, worms crawling out of his mouth as he spoke.  "Gooooo awwaaayyy!" said the staggering, rotting body of the first of their companions to die in the beginning dungeon explorations, one arm dangling from it's socket like a signboard hanging from only one chain. Stunned, the party looked at each other, ashen faced.  They were about to face the dead bodies of not only former party members, but members of the village and caravans they had tried to protect!
<br><br>
"No!" "Oh my god, Haacker! (the name of the ranger)" "That bastard!"  Various shouts of disgust, anger and fear echoed throughout the room, some of which was directed at me! (Who, of course, as gm is the impartial observer in the actions of his NPC's… Muhahahahaha)  Freaked out, the party fell back, not wanting to mutilate the bodies of their friends.  At that point, Lareth struck with his spells and higher level undead.  Shaking with trepidation, the party cleric turned the lower undead, so they ran away despite the presence of their creator. Their fearsome targets scattered, the party was able to rally and defeat the evil cleric and his minions. Later they cast dispel magics on the undead which were their friends, and actually returned to raise the ranger from the dead.  They didn't have enough money at the time, but that's another quest…
<br><br>

Happy Halloween!
