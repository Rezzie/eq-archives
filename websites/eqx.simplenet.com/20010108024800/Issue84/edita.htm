So what do I do with a week off?  With the exception of a very successful trip to Las Vegas, I do nothing differently than I do every week, except with more sleeping and no working.  For me, heaven would have to involve at least nine hours of sleep every night.
<br><br>
I've been thinking about what attracts me to certain role-playing games over others.  There are, I think, three basic parts to any role-playing game:  the system, the tone, and the setting.  The system is the numbers part of the game.  It's the number of dice you need, the type of dice you need, and how these dice interact with the rules.  For the most part, the system is fairly unimportant.  As long as it's flexible enough and robust enough to allow the GM and the players to use it the way that they want, it's fine.  A system like Melee (if any of you remember that one) is not what I would call a good system.  There are three stats, and everything is rolled on a six-sided die.  There's no flexibility, no leeway.  But then it was built to be a combat game, not really a role-playing game.  Most of the games on the market these days have a solid and flexible system.
<br><br>
The tone of a game is important.  A good example is Dark Champions as compared to Champions.  If you read comics, you'll understand the difference right away.  I once saw a panel where Batman had a criminal by the neck and was about to kill him.  Daredevil was attempting to restrain him.  The Dark Knight is the essence of dark comics, and Dark Champions.  It's the seedy side of the hero business.  It's the life of those that maybe aren't so super, or maybe aren't so much heroes as vigilantes.  Both games settings use the same rules system, but they play very differently.  In fact, many very good game systems work with many different settings.
<br><br>
But I love many different settings.  I can enjoy playing the pure hero, the Captain Justice character that lives only to right the wrongs of this world and sets standards for himself that would make most people ill.  And I get a kick out of playing the seedy hero, the one that wants to make sure that [insert injustice here] never happens to anyone ever again, even if that means he must turn himself into a monster to prevent it.  If the mood is set properly, most settings can be a lot of fun.  So, for me, the setting needs to be one that the GM loves.  Sure, I have my preferences, but if the GM doesn't love it, then it won't be as good a setting when he relays it to the players.  Yes, I prefer to play the vigilante.  But if the GM loves a 4-color hero game, then that setting will be a lot of fun for me too.
<br><br>
No, it really comes down to the setting.  Well, maybe setting isn't the right word.  I really mean history.  Let me think of my favorite games...  in no particular order...  Call of Cthulu, World of Darkness, RuneQuest (Glorantha), Dungeons and Dragons, and... um... Champions.  There are others, I'm sure, but these five come to mind easiest.  And I like them because of their settings, their histories.
<br><br>
The hardest one on the list to explain is Champions.  I just don't like the history that they give us.  I've rarely played in a game of Champions where we used the history given us in the box.  On that score, Champions shouldn't be on this list.  But I really love the superhero genre, and so far Champions is the best game (for me) in that genre.  I might very well change my mind when I finally break down and purchase a copy of Aberrant, the new superhero game using the World of Darkness system (the system for Vampire: the Masquerade).
<br><br>
And, actually, I feel the same way about the world that TSR created for us for use with D&D.  I was never very inspired by the settings they designed.  In this case, though, it may be that I'm just not that big of a fan of the standard fantasy setting.  But since we've been playing D&D for, er... seventeen years or so, we've made some changes.  It's basically the same setting, and we center ourselves on the world of Greyhawk, but we've mutated it enough that it feels like it's ours.  And I guess I like it well enough now that we've molded it a bit.
<br><br>
But the other three are games that shine for their setting.  There is nothing that compares to playing in the world that H.P. Lovecraft created.  The twisted darkness of it all, the underlying terror.  And there is a history to it.  When your character is in that world, fighting for his life and sanity, you can often feel the depth of the evil that lies under it all.  And you know that there's a deep underlying story to it, even if you know that your poor character will never likely see much of it.  Getting into the depths of this story will drive you mad...
<br><br>
The World of Darkness, created by White Wolf, is the same way for me.  But it's not that the depths are terrifying, like those of Call of Cthulu.  No, the World of Darkness is the essence of evil.  Machinations, power plays, eternal damnation, and struggles with inner turmoil is the rule there.  And for every little push or pull on the fabric of the world that your character attempts, there is a framework of webbing and spiders there to pull back.  When you wander into a new city, you know there is a history already waiting for you there.  You know that you're going to be affected by it, even if you never understand it.  And the history of these webs is deep.  The interplay between the factions of the world is intriguing enough.  But getting to poke around in it is a blast.
<br><br>
And lately we've been playing RuneQuest.  This is the RuneQuest of Glorantha.  Glorantha is another world with a deep history.  Probably the most complete and unique history in any fantasy setting that I know of.  I've been playing for years, and I don't know all of it.  It's unusual to find a fantasy world that is not only unique, but complete.  In Glorantha Dwarves aren't just short humans with genetically short tempers and a propensity for the use of axes.  In Glorantha Dwarves are part living being, part earth.  Literally.  They are more machines than humans.  It's best to look at them like you would an alien.  Most people actually have a hard time playing the non-human races in RuneQuest.  If you play a Gloranthan Elf in the same way that you play a D&D Elf, then you should be taken out and beaten.  Elves are part plant.  They are not human-ish plant lovers, they are made up of plant.  It's a subtle thing, and something that is hard to really understand (or explain).  But it's the setting that makes Glorantha such a great place to play a character.
<br><br>
And that's where I think EverQuest and Norrath fall short.  The system is good.  A solid and balanced thing that's as flexible as it can be, considering the medium.  And the tone is great.  It's a heroic fantasy game where you are set up as the hero (and maybe on the race-war server you will be able to be either hero or villain).  It's unfortunate that there isn't any real chance to be a villain on the standard servers (Hail paladin, I am a necromancer, and I wish to use your corpse in my treacherous plots.  Duel me!).  
<br><br>
I think I know a lot about the history of Norrath.  And with what I know, I wouldn't be able to run a reasonable campaign based on it.  There are too many holes in the setting, not really enough to keep things going.  I know that we are supposed to be able to pick up the history while playing.  And I have been able to get a feel for the current state of the world.  I think I know who hates who, and who is corrupt and who is nice.  But what we know of Norrath covers only two time periods, right now and way back when.  I know the world as it is today.  And I know about the gods and the creation myth.  And we know something about Miragul and his life.  But all of that is ancient history.
<br><br>
Who was the hero of the last great war between Qeynos and the denizens of BlackBurrow?  Who was it that stood longest on the walls of Rivervale the last time that the Goblins raided?  Who founded Freeport?  Who were the last five rulers of the Dwarven kingdom and what changes did they make?
<br><br>
I know, I know, it is the players that make the recent history of Norrath.  I've heard that from Verant.  But it doesn't work.  The great battle that Absor helped with (well, I tried anyhow) will never be a part of history.  Where will it be remembered that the Gnoll Commander of BlackBurrow was slain as he and his elite guards charged into the unsuspecting masses of low ranking adventurers at the entrance to his holdings?  Let's ignore the fact that he was slain just an hour before in a less entertaining fashion as he 'spawned' in his lair and the five high level characters pounded him to mush even before his elite guards could 'spawn' to protect him.  The player characters just can't make history.  And they can't really interact with it either.
<br><br>
Norrath lacks any recent history, and solid setting for us to work with.  And due to the nature of the beast that is the multi-player on-line role-playing game, we can't make a history of our own.  When Vox was slain, it was a big event.  But it will happen again, and again.
<br><br>
But I still spend a few hours each night poking about in the world of Norrath.  And there are things about it that are a blast.  Isolated incidents, fragments of role-playing.  That one battle with the Gnoll Commander, if taken completely on it's own, is a great incident.  But it will never mesh with the incidents that others have had in that same place, nor will it change Norrath.  And that's a plain shame.
