I've been reading up on <a href="http://www.neverwinternights.com/">Neverwinter Nights</a> a bit.  And I have to say, if they get it to do everything that they plan on getting it to do, I'll be playing it.  Neverwinter Nights isn't due out for a year yet, so I really am going to be forced to hold my breath until I turn exceptionally blue before getting to see it.
<br><br>
I know, this is an EverQuest site and Neverwinter Nights isn't EverQuest.  But look at what they've got in mind.  Out of the box it will be a single player game similar to the other "RPGs" out there.  But the game will also include several multi-player modules, games that can be hosted on a home PC, run over a 56k modem and have about eight players.  So, out of the box, you can set up your PC (or convince a friend to do it) to host a multi-player game running their modules with a bunch of your friends playing along with you.
<br><br>
Get done with that and you should have no trouble finding player created modules to play in.
<br><br>
But for me the true thrill here is that they are planning on giving us a complete set of world building and GM tools, the very same ones that the development team is using to build their worlds.  So enterprising GMs can design their own modules and be there to play the NPCs!  If these tools are truly functional, then Neverwinter Nights might be the last RPG that I buy.  Not that the computer game industry is going to lose a big customer if that happens.  Up until I first heard about Ultima Online, I was NOT a fan of what they call Role-Playing Games.  I've got Planescape: Torment on my PC at home right now.  I tried Baldur's Gate (lasted about one hour before I shelved it).  These are not role-playing games.  They just can't be because there is nobody to role-play with.  To me these are just complicated choose your own adventure style books.  I'm still playing Planescape: Torment because I'm still entertained by the story they are telling me, not because I think of it as a good role-playing game.
<br><br>
Some of my dear friends from the Internet are probably tapping their monitors right now, planning to lambaste me for saying that.  Some of them contend that you can role-play in any game, even Monopoly.  That may be true, but that doesn't make Monopoly a role-playing game.  Me, I want to play a honest-to-goodness computer role-playing game.
<br><br>
That's why I wanted to play Ultima Online.  The only reason that I didn't is because I missed out on the beta, I heard about it too late.  After that, for some reason that I can't explain, I lost interest.  But I can still remember finding out about it and showing the web site to a bunch of my computer literate friends.  The idea was stunning.  A computer game that allowed you to interact and actually role-play over the Internet!  Sure, there were MUDs out there, but I never was attracted to them.  I was never entertained by games like Zork, so I figured a MUD wouldn't be interesting either.  But a full-fledged computer game, with the splendor of Ultima, the atmosphere for role-playing, and real people to play with had me interested.  Unfortunately, before I could actually get myself out to buy Ultima Online, I started reading about it.  I guess I was unduly influenced by the written word and decided to wait for TNBT (the next best thing).
<br><br>
That was EverQuest.  The opportunity that I had to interact with the folks at Verant on the Avault hosted newsgroup that was the official board for the upcoming game (and is now ignored by them *pouts*), and my experience with them from Tanarus, had me all excited.
<br><br>
I think I might be even more excited about Neverwinter Nights.
<br><br>
Here's what I would like to be a part of.  Four or five people get together (more figuratively than literally), to build and GM a world.  Neverwinter Nights is planning on allowing portals from one host to another.  So five standard home PCs could work together to host a single world, with only the portal transition time as a barrier.  Then have perhaps five to ten others to help out, building stuff for the game or running about as GMs for the players…
<br><br>
I'm also very interested to put my hand to creating an Absor version of Baldur's Gate.  I want to see if I can build a better world, a more interesting and interactive world, than the next guy.  I love the idea of being able to set up a world like that.  I think I'm as interested in the creative part of it all as I am in the role-playing part.  I like telling stories, and I want to see if I can work in the medium of Neverwinter Nights.
<br><br>
What else are they planning for us...  Mac and Lynux versions.  Programming hooks to allow us to have the world react to things like entering a room, a certain item being in the area, key words spoken and several others.  The GM will be able to control any NPC.  You can restrict your world to the levels and items that you want.  Scripting wizards, as well as the tools to write script on your own.  A PvP switch that the GM can choose to throw whenever he needs to.  The ability to ban a player (by CD code, not by character name) from your server.  Possible real time voice communication...
<br><br>
Neverwinter Nights is boasting intentions to do all sorts of great stuff.  It remains to be seen if they can pull it off.  But they've got my glowing endorsement for their attempt.  I think I'll be spending a lot of my time reading about their progress.  Hell, I may even start sticking my nose in, making suggestions and asking questions.  Don't quit your EverQuest account.  But keep your eyes open, I sense something interesting in our future.
