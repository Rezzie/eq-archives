          All for the Lack of a Dress!</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The trolls 
          are growing wings and the pixies hairy toes,<br>
          Firiona is chasing Fippy, and in Qeynos anything goes.<br>
          The world is topsy-turvy, and an ever growing mess<br>
          And so you want to know the reason? The lack of a dress!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dragons 
          are crooning lovesongs and inviting you to tea,<br>
          The skeletons are growing skin these days, just like you and me<br>
          The sea is full of cornstalks and halflings all confess<br>
          That the world is going crazy because Nep wants a dress</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sun 
          pierces Surefall&#146;s shadows, waterfalls are flowing in Sky.<br>
          Now Guk is full of flowers and people are wondering why.<br>
          It&#146;s such a simple answer, I&#146;m sure that you can guess,<br>
          The world needs a little fashion and Nep, of course, needs a dress.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Frontier 
          Mountains tomorrow will open a shopping mall<br>
          and Dreadlands will become a palace for those going to the ball<br>
          Squire Wembley will plunge into lava (an act that some will bless)<br>
          And all this is so needless, if Nep only had her dress.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her quest 
          is long and perilous, the trail goes high and low<br>
          She searches every land and town and talks with every foe<br>
          She doesn&#146;t want the moon I&#146;ve heard, and planes gear even 
          less<br>
          All darling Nep is asking for is just one lovely dress.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now should 
          you wonder why a dress for this half elven lass,<br>
          Simply walk a ways behind her and notice her cold bare ass.<br>
          Should anyone be so embarrassed or under such duress?<br>
          Think how happily she would sing if only she had her dress.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elven maids 
          can take the stage in purple, or blue or white<br>
          Human bards can choose attire but Nep faces fashion blight<br>
          So to your desks and pens and scrolls, let&#146;s ink the letterpress!<br>
          Bombard the fashion mavens, let&#146;s all get Nep a dress.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For now 
          she must be content to walk in warrior&#146;s grimy gear<br>
          And depend on mail or leather or patches to cover her rear<br>
          She isn&#146;t going a begging though, or asking for largess,<br>
          A simple gown, a flowing skirt would indeed make her dress</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Should 
          the question then arise, what if Nep&#146;s quest would fail?<br>
          Will she wallow, will she whine? Will she weep, or scream or wail?<br>
          Or will she stand upon the stage, singing under a lover&#146;s moon<br>
          and vow that if she can&#146;t have a dress, she&#146;ll marry Aradune?</font></p>
