<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, and well met. I am a Dark Elf Shadow Knight and hated by most every creature on the face of Norrath.  I find myself in a small dilemma. Soon I must make my way to the isle of Faydwer to slay Faeries for their dust, and in my humble opinion and reasoning I feel there may be an easier way to acquire this powder than taking a long boat trip and slaying winged little people. Now don't get me wrong, killing them is not much of a problem because my heart feels no pity towards those who will attack me without asking questions or detest me because of my nature. But I am curious if there may be an easier way to obtain the Faerie Dust I require other than making a Faerie village into a place bereft of life and happiness?  Even I appreciate the good things in life and something about these little people brings a glimmer of warmth to my dark heart.  Thank you for your time to listen to my plight.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;While, of course, such deep qualms about wreaking havoc on the delightful vale of the Faeries, warms my heart immensely, I am completely puzzled by a Dark Elf who even has the words happiness and appreciate in his vocabulary.   Obviously you are one who has traveled and experienced the realms in such a way that the dark doors of hate have opened onto a more genteel perspective, for which I congratulate you.  Thus I think you will be glad of my answer to your question.  While it is true that faerie dust can only be obtained originally through the demise of one of the denizens of the village, the dust itself is often bought and sold in various markets.  I think with some discreet inquiry and the use of the go-between if necessary, you might actually be able to purchase your dust and have no sad faerie deaths on your awakening conscience.   For fear of engaging Innoruuk's interest in this discussion, I will end now and simply wish you good journeys and many thanks for not disturbing the charm of the faerie village.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the spawn rate for Paglan. the barbarian that you need to get the head from to get the Langseax of the Wolves?.  
<br><br>
Millenium
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere in my searches could I find the spawn rate for Paglan.  If what I remember is correct, however, it's possible that in order for him to spawn, something else has to occur first in Everfrost?  You might want to bundle up, put on extra socks, and wander  up into the cold realms to question some of the more experienced barbarian warriors in Halas on this.  Be sure to be quick to provide the ale and surely one will be able to give you more accurate information than I can.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nepenthia!  I am a new reader to EQX, and the question I have I am not sure if its in a back issue or not.  If so, please tell me and I will go there, but…  The question is as follows:  There seems to be a big mystery as to how or when the cooks spawn in the Mistmoore Castle.  I have been up there 3 times now and camped the room for many hours on end.  Only to find no cooks have spawned.  My question is, can you confirm what it does take to get these cooks to spawn?  I have been told there was a bug with them and they don't spawn.  I have been told they do spawn every 30 min (along with another critter, usually a sapper).  The sapper spawns, but no cook.  Is this a problem only on the Povar server?  Please, anything you can tell me I would greatly appreciate.  Thank you! Nice articles also!

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing.  While I have yet to visit Mistmoore without dying within the first few hundred feet of the entrance, the Pillars of Wisdom, particularly Sylvos, were able to point out that the spawn of the cook is dependent on the death of the placeholding npc.  It is possible that the sapper is the placeholder for the cook but it is also possible that the rare spawn of the cook does not happen every time a sapper is killed but is rather only rarely activated.  That is about the limit of information I could get as Sylvos was busy getting ready to either heroically die or, even better, heroically help break Fearplane.  (See reference to Innoruuk above -- *shivers*.) 
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi there :)  I am a High Elf Magician and have heard all sorts of stories about how much experience a pet will take, ranging from "as a party member of equal level" to "none if it does less than 50 damage".  It's all very confusing and everyone I speak to says that the other information is rumor and hearsay.  Could you please clear this up? thank you very much for your time. Good Journey to you.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to one of the most necroish of the necros that I know, Darnalak, and asked about this.  Darnalak states that this issue is continually under debate but that in his experience, a pet will take minimal experience when the player is soloing, and none at all when the player with the pet is grouped.  The wizard on a mission, Adelrune, also agreed.  I, too, have heard tons of stories of pets "stealing" experience and tales of bugs whereby the pet would take experience under a given set of circumstances, i.e., the bard had her left eye closed in a wink at the cleric who was twibbling just as the npc died whereupon the pet grabbed every last point of experience.  Hmmm, I think for now, pending any sort of more scientific disclosure, I'm going to go with Darnalak's and Adel's views and hope that it helps you with this.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a simple question:   Who are the gods mentioned with the Council of Rathe.  The ones who beat up Rallos Zek.  The only one mentioned is Xegony.  Thank you.
<br><br>

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My goodness, if everyone had such a simple question, I wonder if this column would ever manage to get written.  Seriously, I have done a lot of research trying to track this story down through various Everquest sites and have not been able to do so.  It is possible this story is included in the tales from the historic quests, but I sure haven't been able to find a thing.  However, the history published on the EQ website does state that at one point, after Veeshan, Brell, Tunare, Prexus, Rallos Zek, Innoruuk, Bristlebane and Cazic Thule had all been working to carve away chunks of territory, there was a humungous battle and Rallos Zek did get his rearend kicked rather badly by some angry co-gods.    Xegony was not mentioned in this history, nor was a Council of Rathe, so it's possible there is more to the story that I can't find.  Should anyone know more on this story, I'd sure appreciate hearing from you so we don't leave Rechoolet's question unanswered.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Re: XP penalties and such:  Well, I don't know whether you really want to know this (spoilers ahead) but... it seems that only the large races get any sort of XP penalty for race while Halflings get an XP bonus!!  The rest of the experience penalties and bonuses are based on class.   Warriors and Rogues have a bonus, wisdom-based pure casters have zero bonus/penalty, intelligence-based pure casters have a penalty.   Monks do have even a larger penalty and the hybrids (including Bards!) have receive the largest penalty.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing in on the issue.  You'll note that I removed the exact amounts of experience penalty and bonus that you mentioned as EQ Express has always tried hard not to move into the realms of spoils.  The good thing about me editing your letter, is that I was so busy trying to do a good job, that I completely forgot about ranting on and on about this disgraceful treatment of bards!  Give me a few moments as I pull up my wine crate to stand on (no soapboxes for bards after all), and I will begin to orate on this issue.  Unless of course, Ardel grabs my arm and hauls me into the inn for a quick cool one instead.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question but an answer ta Jorelei's question!  Greets fellow child of Brell, I also had this dilemma as a young Dwarf.  At tha young age of two seasons I got tha wanderlust and headed fer tha city of Freeport.  It was there I found me purpose in life:  Orcs.  There I was, takin care o' tha city's rodent and reptile population when somethin called an Orc Pawn came and beat me senseless.  Well, I hunted closer ta tha guards until I found I could handle them and that was it.  When I found I could handle them easily I remember hearin from young elves near Kaladim about tha problem they've had with tha Crushbone Orcs.  I took tha boat back ta Faydwer, traveled ta Greater Faydark and took up residence on Orc Hill (I like ta call it Orcburger Hill).  Ah tha battles we took part in <tear in one eye>.  It was glorious, tha cries of orcs shouting their revenge, tha satisfaction of helpin out those around ye.  That's what bein' a Pally is all about.  I still go there as a 24th Season Paladin ta heal and help those overcome by tha orcs.  Goin back ta me roots is truly satisfyin. Orcs, me friend, Orcs.  They're everywhere.  GFay, LFay, Crushbone, Commonlands, Ro. Ye'll never find  a shortage of uglies ta bash and those in need of aid whether by yer sword or spell.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank'ee kind dwarf mister for yer letter and advice to Jorelei.  't's much appreciated indeed.  I too have experienced my share of orc odor and grimaces up too close and, like you,  finally seem to be able to join with you and all likeminded civilized inhabitants of the world to rid the realms of the seemingly endless supply of nasty creatures.  Good journeys to you and may orcs ever pop up in front of you as your axe swings to clear the path.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question, but someone was wondering in Issue 116 where one might find some wonderful maps of Norrath.  As a druid, I travel quite a bit and need a map or two to keep myself from becoming lost.  I've found the best maps at the following website:  http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/index2e.html
This is a Japanese website, but English is used enough to navigate and find the maps you need.  They are wonderful hand drawn maps and must be seen to be truly appreciated.  Hope this helps other travelers of Norrath.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for sending along the map website.  There are many links out there to sites with maps available for the foggy-headed travelers who can get lost almost, but not quite, as fast as I can.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few question about jewelry making at what lvl in jewelry making can I make things that add str wis sta and all those other stats.  Why do merchants cheat you when you go to them?   I mean I sell them something then they charge five times that amount when selling.
P.S as to that question about Asheron's  Call,  I don't think they have a bard class and I know the only pc race is human.  Thank you.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosethorn, a master jeweler and Pillar of Wisdom combined into one obliging soul, was willing to take a few minutes to go over the basic of jewelry making with me.  (Would the tailors and dressmakers in Norrath be so willing to help a poor bard get a dress!)  The first thing you need to be aware of is that if you are not an enchanter, you need to make friends with one right away as you will need enchanted metals for your creations and only enchanters can prepare them for you.  Rosethorn said that you need to have about a level 36 in jewelry making to make the first items with added stats such as strength.  There is a basic ring you can make then that will add plus 2 strength to its wearer.  Jewelry making is not for the faint of heart or for the poor.  It is an expensive craft to learn indeed.  You find yourself able to save time and money however by asking advice from master jewelers and learning from their mistakes or by spending sometime among the tomes of wisdom found at www.eqportal.com/jewelry/ or some of the other sites out there.  As for the merchants, well -- I heard that they have a rivalry each year to show who has made the best profit margin and thus buy the wares of craftsman, like the jewelers, for as little as possible in order to win the contest  I believe that while selling beginner's jewelry to merchants will not add to your bankbook, you will have an opportunity in the future to at least eke out a meager profit from some of the magical jewelry you create.   (PS:  Thanks for the info on AC but my question back is:  How can any game call itself a game without bards?  *Snorts in disgust* !)

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to respond to the riddle... "Angry and hungry are two words in the English language that end in gry. There are three words in the English language. What is the third word?"  The answer, in all reality, is language.  Actually this is a quest in the game Planescape: Torment.  The actual riddle is "Angry and Hungry are two of three words that end in g-r-y in the human tongue.  What is the last word?"  The answer is tongue which is the last word of the sentence.  This should clear up the problem because the last answer that was given in issue 116 did not make any sense.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing in.  I get the impression that this is one of those age-old and yet constantly modified riddles set into different contexts.  One of the responses to it came from a librarian who said that the question on the "grys" is one that the reference desk is always being asked about.  I wonder, has anyone ever searched any of the online dictionaries for the ending "gry"?  That could be interesting.

It's nice to be back this week after a very pleasant EQ Express vacation.  I did receive a peculiar piece of mail, nicely copied onto parchment but blush a bit at the somewhat inaccurate supposition of fame contained in it.  The note read, "I am an innocent l'il bard girl in Qeynos and I want to be as famous in the world as you.  How do I do it?"  It wasn't signed, so although I prefer not to toot my own horn unless singing for an audience, I find the only way I can answer it is here in my column.  My answer is this:  <em>Dear musical child, should you seek fame, do so because your heart has a deep music and understanding to share with the world, not because you seek to emulate an old bard with many journeys and many strange experiences already  past.   Whether in innocence or in experience, keep your ears open and your fingers ready for your task.  Stay honest as a bard can be (after all prevarication can be a lifesaver at times) and always let the appreciative member of the audience buy you a drink.  If you follow all these instructions,  your fame and probably your fortune will soon eclipse mine and I will be the first to cheer you on!</em>
<br><br>
Hope to hear from all of you soon.<br>
