<br><br>
Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
Hail my friend ! I thought it prudent after reading your reply on wood elves, to share a  little story with you...
<br><br>
*looks around, leaning on her bow a little*
<br><br>
...it happened one day, that I found myself in the Deserts of Ro,  a stiflingly dry horrid little plane of existance from whence it seemed water just disappeared at an abnormily long rate, and even the crocodiles need to dive deep into the water to get wet enough...anyways, it happens that it was there I met my Second Only Barbarian Friend After You - he was leaning up against some rocks and was gutting some kind of little caimen with a rather wicked looking knife - in fact, it was so wicked looking that I held tighly to my axe as I approached him.....being in desperate need of water as I was, I forced myself to speak to him..
<br><br>
"Hail sir, I was wondering if ye would have any spare water, mine seems to of been stolen by yon Big Golden Sun".....It was polite, it was nice, I even *shudder* ..SMILED for him, and you know what he said ? you know what this big oafish man with marks on his face that looked like the scribbly drawings small elvish children do in their creche years?
<br><br>
He LAUGHED AT ME !! And he kept laughing and laughing !!! It was some time before he calmed down, and I asked him why he was laughing, at this stage holding onto my axe rather more tightly....he explained that as I approached, one of my ears had popped out through the small slit in my banded helm and that he had mistaken me for a RABBIT !! He then went on to explain that he was so shocked to realise that I was a PERSON that he couldnt help himself !
<br><br>
Despite that minor .....thing, we became fast friends as I described to him the nature of my race, and he explained that they wernt scribbles done by little elf children....but, my question to you, is how the HECK do you Barbarian types mistake us elves for RABBITS ALL THE TIME ???
<br><br>
*leans back, draws a deep breath and smile*
<br><br>
I'm sure you have a logical explanation my friend - and I'll look forward to your reply !
<br><br>
til next we meet !

Dear Madouq,
<br><br>
HEHE!  Ayeps I's not one bit surprised.  When I done met da Morgy who's like ya's, Ranger, gits losted, and has ears dat stick out.  Dats gotta hurt ya's know.  I done thinked da same thingy.  I was locked in a bashy like no others.  It was iffen da beastie or me scored da next hit who was gonna live.  I was bleedin from EVERYWHERE and it to.  I was swingin me bestest, but I was so done tired.  Me body was sayin Oxes jist lay down and sleepy.  Ya's will be back in da snow.  And den me sayin  NO!  I's gonna walk back ta da snow wiff it's head!  Den me body suddenly felt better.  It hit me and I laughed cause compared ta da pain afore twas nothing and I killed it.  I's turned around a knowing dat someone had done Medicine.  I's thinky a Holy must o seen good bashy from da Tribunal a talk'n.  And der was dis WITTY personage.  I had said thank ya's afore I turned round and it TALKED!
<br><br>
Welpers, it done talky good.  In fact I's never knew talky like dat.  Was all sound'n like a flooter tooter and stuff. And move!  Seesh  I's never seen something so quick.  I's explained I's had a rock dat was no good.  It said a rock?  I said ayeps, gots scribble on it and I's can't even throw it!  Then it laughed!  I was bout ta git madded cause I was dang stinky upset I had a rock I couldn't throw and it tolded me it was fer learned personages.  They knew what da scribble meant.  So I's said come wiff me and I's give it to ya's ta give at learned personages.  While we's a run'n I noticed stuff.  Wabbits fuzzy all over.  He weren't.  He were a WITTY personage.  I dunno how one so small so smarts and stuff.  Ya know, when everything dat ya's gots ta look around yer knees is usually lunch or a nasty gnoll or gobby.  It's hard ta imagen dat thingys in dis world were made so small dat can talk and stuff.  I's mean, da sled doggie woof woofs ya's size.  But dey don't do what ya's do…  See what I's mean?  Ya's sure as heck dunt have yer butt skin show'n outta yer pants or bark and half talk ta us.

Dear Da Basher,
<br><br>
OHHHH!!  On's paper.  I dunno bout dat stuff how dat is done.  But I's asked da Absor bard bout it.  He knows all sorts o things and can sing to!
<br><br>
I's like yer name.  Yer Mommy's did ya's proud.  Ya know's I's kindo proud o me own name.  When I was a barb-cub, witty and stuff, all da tribe done gathered round and say, Tribe dey said, what's we gonna called dis lil girly type.  Welpers der was some olders cubs der dat were allowed ta come and one o em yelleded at his Mommy's side  "She's gots arms like an Ox!"  Welpers his Mommy done turned around and smacked da snott outta him fer talking when da Holy's were.  But Holy's, ya's know, dey so wise and smart and have da know'n o everything dat's ta know.  So dey say "Dunt smacked da lil un wiff big slams and make'n da bloody nose.  Fer he done speaked wiff lots o looking and see'n and stuff.  Fer she do have da maybe's o being as strong as an Ox one day."  Den da kido's Mommy looked very shamed and stuff but proud to her son was speak'n and a known like a Holy so young.  So two days later after da Fires Dance and Names, I was done called Oxesiess.
<br><br>
Laters, I was help'n me Mommy a sewin da warm furrs and makin stuff fer da tribe.  A body would comes in and Mommy, cause I was to wittle den, would say "Oxes, go see what dey want ya's can't hold up dis whole Hide and da thread at da same time".  So I's go out.  Welpers it was dis man dat was exactly as tall as I's been, only he looked like he had to much sun.  He said things I didn't understand.  So I's say "I dunt git it I's sorry".  Welpers he's gots really mad, and fer some reason hated our sled doggies cause he kept talk'n bout em while point at me.  So I's tolded him "Me Mommy is try ta sew up a whole hide, and I's ta lil ta hold it fer her.  So I's come ta talky. I's purrty good at talky I thinky but dunt understand."  I's turned around and pointed hope'n he could show me what he wanted.  Welpers he's done spit on Mommy's special made fer us rug wiff da jaws o a polar and da head still on it's.  It was her bested sewin ever, and he spits on it and done walked out.
<br><br>
After dat. Mommy was kind o funny bout me round da shop and stuff.  And Daddy would say "Dunno what's we gonna do" lots.  Da other cubs heard bout it and da boys used ta dance round me going "Youuuusss Bad talky Youuussss Bad talky!"  Den one day when I was bringin witty wolf pelts back fer Mommy, one o da boys tried ta looky up me kilt.  Welpers, I's done dropped da pelts and beat da snot outta him.  Next thingy I know's der's stuff hittin me all over screamin "Bad talky", and I's think'n am not!  Jist didn't understanded and said SO!  And welpers I's gots so mad dat I was hurt'n and dey sayin dat stuff…  dat I's jist went nuts.  Next thingy I know a Holy has me by da back o me kilt and I's jist swinging and a yellin ta let me go, let me at em.  Dis voice said "Stop Oxesiess!" and suddenly I's frozen and can't move.  Der was bout 20 growed up barbs all standin and watchin.  Mommy and Daddy were der jist look'n at me all wide eyed.  I looked down and five boys were make'n da snow go all red and stuff and look'n down at meself, I's gots yellow purple marks all over me.  Dat day dey sent me ta da Warrior trainin.  I's couldn't believe it!
<br><br>
Dat's how's I's done gotted me last name one day.  Cause of stuff dat gotted me ta be a Warrior as a She-barb in da Firsted place.  Now I's come home, covered in blood and guts and beat up and stuff, and no one dances round sayin bad talky.  Now Mommy starts ta git all water eyed a looking at me and Daddy puts his arm round her and goes "Ayeps dear, dat's OUR Oxesiess!"
