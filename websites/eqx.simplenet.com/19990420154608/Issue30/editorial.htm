For the last several months I have been reading, writing and arguing around this topic.  I've been dodging it as much as Sony has.  But I think I'll take a stab at it and see if I can come close enough to the truth to make this editorial worth while.
<br><br>
First, the history:
<br><br>
I think it first started when one of the frequent posters in the Avault forum adamantly stated, and I paraphrase, that there was more that one way to role-play and that everyone role-played differently.  Now this fella was talking about PvP and non-PvP options, but it blossomed from there.  On and off now for several months I have read and written posts about exactly what role-playing is, or is not.  Some folks claim that they can define role-playing and have posted these definitions.  Some say that there is no way to define it because it is different for everyone.  And several times questions about role-playing have been asked directly to the staff at 989 Studios.  Like this one from the most recent monthly chat:
<br><br>
<b>Q:</b> [EQV-Qs] I heard, somewhere down the line, that there was going to be a PvP server. I also heard that you have an overwhelmingly large budget to work on so, will you also be implementing a Role-Playing server or two? 
<br><br>
<b>A:</b> [Aradune] No, all servers will be the same. Both +pvp and -pvp players will co-exist, and this is on purpose -- we feel keeping people together so they can talk, interact, trade, etc. is important, regardless of whether they are +pvp or -pvp. As for roleplaying servers, until the world agrees upon what rping exactly means, we really don't think that would be realistic. 
<br><br>
This made me think, ala Arsenio, hmmm….
<br><br>
But I, as usual, kept plodding along, posting silly stuff to the newsgroup.  While in the back of my head there were rumblings.
<br><br>
Then came another thread in the Avault group, one that started innocently and blossomed into this editorial of all things.
<br><br>
Russell Linton responds to a snippet of a post from Onyx:
<br><br>
<em>]] 5) Roleplaying...Just WHAT is it??!
<br><br>
Hey we have the "official" answer to this one so we cant even talk about that!  Its some completely nebulous thing that cant be defined but should be encouraged.  :)</em>
<br><br>
To which I replied:
<br><br>
<em>I suspect that one of us could write a definition that ninety percent of the posters here could agree on.  While I think I understand why Brad said that, I find it hard to accept.  Am I the only one?</em>
<br><br>
That seemed to have drawn out the elusive, yet domesticated, Charles Flock (beta test manager for EQ):
<br><br>
<em>Didn't someone one the Supreme Court say something like, " I can't define it but I know it when I see it"? I think that applies here.~Friar</em>
<br><br>
Hmmmm….  I thought again, and answered:
<br><br>
<em>Then all I gotta do is show it to ya!</em>
<br><br><br>
 
Enough history…
<br><br>
I just wrote that post and I am all fired up to write an editorial about this topic.  Ever since hearing of EverQuest I've wanted desperately to find some way to show everyone what role-playing is, why it's fun, how it's done, and why we need it in EverQuest.  I have immense respect for Brad and Charles (hehe, I even assume a first name familiarity with them!), but they really are wrong on this.  There IS a definition for role-playing.  It CAN be quantified, and therefore it can be taught, it can be rated, weighed, ranked, scored and just as easily ignored.  I challenged someone on that newsgroup to come up with a definition for role-playing that 90% of the posters there could agree on.  Well, I'm gonna try it myself.
<br><br>
Let's start with the <a href="http://www.m-w.com">Mirraim-Websters</a> definition:
<br><br>
Main Entry: <b>role-play</b><br>
Pronunciation: 'rOl-"plA, -'plA<br>
Date: 1949<br>
transitive senses : ACT OUT [students were asked to role-play the thoughts and feelings of each character -- R. G. Lambert]<br>
intransitive senses : to play a role <br>
<br>
As much as I love their on-line dictionary, this seems like a pretty meager definition.  But it's a good start.  Let me rewrite that without all the -'~ stuff and clear it up.
<br><br>
<b>Role-play:</b> To act out or play a role.  [example: students were asked to <em>role-play</em> the thoughts and feelings of each character -- R. G. Lambert]
<br><br>
In essence, that's it.  Really!  Now there is obviously more to it when you apply it to specific cases, such as EverQuest.  But as a definition, that's a great one.  You'll note that it says nothing about setting, which role to play, good or bad role-playing qualities, or killing things.  None of these things are relevant to the basic definition.  But they are relevant to the idea of role-playing in an on-line game.  So I guess I need a new term and a new definition.  How about Role-playing Game?  Fortunately Mirriam-Webster can help me a bit with this.
<br><br>
Main Entry: <b>1game</b><br>
Pronunciation: 'gAm<br>
Function: noun<br>
Etymology: Middle English, from Old English gamen; akin to Old High German gaman amusement<br>
Date: before 12th century<br>
<b>1 a</b> (1) : activity engaged in for diversion or amusement : PLAY (2) : the equipment for a game <b>b</b> : often derisive or mocking jesting : FUN, SPORT [make game of a nervous player]<br>
<b>2 a</b> : a procedure or strategy for gaining an end : TACTIC <b>b</b> : an illegal or shady scheme or maneuver : RACKET<br>
<b>3 a</b> (1) : a physical or mental competition conducted according to rules with the participants in direct opposition to each other (2) : a division of a larger contest (3) : the number of points necessary to win (4) : points scored in certain card games (as in all fours) by a player whose cards count up the highest (5) : the manner of playing in a contest (6) : the set of rules governing a game (7) : a particular aspect or phase of play in a game or sport [a football team's kicking game] <b>b</b> plural : organized athletics <b>c</b> (1) : a field of gainful activity : LINE [the newspaper game] (2) : any activity undertaken or regarded as a contest involving rivalry, strategy, or struggle [the dating game] [the game of politics]; also : the course or period of such an activity [got into aviation early in the game] (3) : area of expertise : SPECIALTY 3 [comedy is not my game]<br>
<b>4 a</b> (1) : animals under pursuit or taken in hunting; especially : wild animals hunted for sport or food (2) : the flesh of game animals <b>b</b> archaic : PLUCK <b>c</b> : a target or object especially of ridicule or attack -- often used in the phrase fair game<br>
<br>
Well heck, there's way more here than we need.  Obviously no part of 4 is appropriate here.  Neither is 1b, 2b and 3b or c.  So I now trim:
<br><br>
Main Entry: <b>1game</b><br>
Pronunciation: 'gAm<br>
Function: noun<br>
Etymology: Middle English, from Old English gamen; akin to Old High German gaman amusement<br>
Date: before 12th century<br>
<b>1</b> (1) : activity engaged in for diversion or amusement : PLAY (2) : the equipment for a game <br>
<b>2 :</b> a procedure or strategy for gaining an end : TACTIC <br>
<b>3  (1) :</b> a physical or mental competition conducted according to rules with the participants in direct opposition to each other (2) : a division of a larger contest (3) : the number of points necessary to win (4) : points scored in certain card games (as in all fours) by a player whose cards count up the highest (5) : the manner of playing in a contest (6) : the set of rules governing a game (7) : a particular aspect or phase of play in a game or sport [a football team's kicking game]<br>
<br>
Now, here is where the arguments usually start.  Luckily for me this is an editorial and you can't argue with me about this until I'm done.  First off, I think we can all agree on number one, that a role-playing game is an activity for amusement, even if we can't always agree on exactly whose amusement and how (a discussion that I plan to tackle further down).  But 1 (2) is not what we are talking about.  Certainly the box and CD for EverQuest are the game, but I'm not talking about that here [scratch].  2 is not important either, we are not talking about a means to an end here [scratch].  And 3 (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) are not applicable at all [scratch].
<br><br>
Number 3 (1), however is the sticky part.  And this is the place where the definition of role-playing and the definition of a role-playing game come to odds, and where any PK worth his salt will pick up the argument, not with the idea of what is and is not fun.  It is not a matter of what is fun.  To some role-playing is fun.  To others competition is fun.  But this has no bearing on what role-playing is.  Role-playing is NEVER a competition.  So whether or not competition is fun has no bearing on what role-playing is.  Certainly characters may compete, but the players NEVER do.  If you do, you are not role-playing.  So 3 (1) has no place in the definition of role-playing.  <em>This is not to say that I don't occasionally compete with other players, even some times to the point of 'My character is tougher than your character!'  But at those times I ain't role-playing.</em>
<br><br>
So the final version of this definition would be:
<br><br>
<b>Role-playing Game:</b> To act out or play a role for diversion or amusement.
<br><br>
Wow, all that for one tiny sentence.  But guess what, it works.  From that I can conclude:
<br><br>
<b>EverQuest:</b> a product designed to allow us to act out a role for our amusement over the Internet with as many as 1,500 other players.
<br><br>
But what do these definitions mean to us, and how can we quantify and judge role-playing, even with a definition.  Well, with some reasonable amount of judgement anyone can watch another person role-playing and determine if he is doing it.  If they are acting out a role, then they ARE role-playing.  That's not so hard.  I can't really even say, under this definition, that the famous d00dz of Ultima Online are not role-playing.  And since I don't want to do that, we also need to establish some way of rating role-playing.  Then if someone does not make the minimum grade we can say that they are not role-playing well enough to be considered actually doing it.  Sorta like me on skis.  You <em>could</em> call what I do skiing, as I would be wearing skis at the time, and I would be on snow, and I would be traveling down hill.  But if we put in a rating scale that says to be skiing well enough I would also have to be upright and in some sort of control (and that's a judgement call not unlike we need to make for determining if someone is role-playing well enough), then it would only be fair to call it falling, not skiing.  The same thing applies to role-playing.  If you are not doing it well enough, you are not doing it at all.
<br><br>
Any of you that have played a Role-Playing Gamers Association (RPGA) game at a game convention will understand the idea.  From the first day of the first convention I ever went to, these conventions have been running Dungeons and Dragons tournaments.  Yup, tournaments.  A role-playing game with winners…  And I never liked that concept.  Sure, my friends and I would play them.  We even won a few.  But it was never really role-playing.  It was a lot more of a strategy game than a role-playing game.  If you stopped to spend a half-hour arguing religion with the party cleric you would lose.  You wouldn't get as far as the next group, you wouldn't kill as many monsters.  It was a poor environment for most of us to learn role-playing in.
<br><br>
Then someone started the RPGA.  I'm embarrassed to say that I don't know much about it's founding, inner workings, or management, despite once being friends with the local regional representative.  But I do know how they run their convention games.  First off, the focus of the games is not the same as your standard D&D tournament.  You are not pushed to reach a goal.  And at the end of the game all the players vote for the winners.  Instead of counting experience or goal points (and subtracting for dead characters) to determine which team went on to the next round, RPGA gamers vote for the best role-players from each group.  The GM also votes.  For all the RPGA events I've ever attended, not once has a player asked; "But how do I determine who was role-playing better?" or "What is role-playing?"  Now even this system has its flaws.  Our GM (we let him play in games when he's been particularly nice), and I determined the real truth to winning an RPGA event.  Play the gnome illusionist.  It's that simple.  If the other players remember you, you will win.  Be funny and loud and when it comes time to vote folks will remember you and vote for you.  My ice queen priestess never seemed to win, even when I knew I deserved it.  But that's a flaw in the judges, not the scoring system.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, perfect or not, one can create a system for rating and judging role-playing.  It's then easy to say that if someone does not meet the minimum "score" then he is not role-playing.  Now where this minimum is set can easily vary from person to person, and may be the source of a lot of arguments.
<br><br>
So what elements would I consider role-playing and what things are not?
<br><br>
You are not role-playing well enough to pass my scale if:
<br><br>
You talk out of character for extended periods of time in an open way (I don't care what you do in a private chat, it doesn't affect the rest of us).<br>
You play a character that does not fit the game world ("I'm a college student that was transported here into the body of an Elf!"  Now, dude…)<br>
Your motivation for killing anyone (PC or NPC) is 'cause I could.  (This is something that is hard to judge without watching a character for extended periods of time.)<br>
And other stuff…<br>
<br>
The point here is that 989 Studios can set this role-playing gauge at whatever level they choose.  And I can understand why they would chose to place it a bit lower than I would.  While it is possible to judge, quantify and determine role-playing, it is not feasible for 989 Studios to do so.  They can't do it in the software code, we all know that.  They can't possibly provide enough human (Troll, Dwarf, whatever) observers to do it.  And I don't think they are ready to do it the way the RPGA does it.  While I think it is feasible to create a system where the players judge who is and is not role-playing and for the game managers (GMs) to act on it; I also think that it would be a tremendous task and would be very prone to abuse, requiring a lot of testing and tweaking.
<br><br>
I guess the whole point behind this editorial is to say that there IS a definition of role-playing.  989 Studios and others are welcome to tell me that there is not.  That's fine.  But there is.  And I think it's a bit of a cop-out to try to hide behind this myth.  I would rather they just tell us that there is no easy way for them to judge who is and who is not role-playing, and that they have no intention of kicking off customers because they don't meet a set role-playing standard.  Tell me this and I'll nod and let them know that I understand.  Tell me that they need to see it to know it, and I'll show it to them.
