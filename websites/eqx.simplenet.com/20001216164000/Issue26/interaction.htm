With the soon to be arrival of Everquest (We all can dream, can't we?) we
will have the opportunity to embark on our own styles of gaming. We can
either play a PVP, and hunt other players down until our blood lust is
satisfied, or play a Non-PVP, and focus upon the monsters of this great
land for our sword swinging excitement. Of course, these are extremes in
both cases, and many gamers fall in a group somewhere in between.

A situation is going to arise that we Ultima Onliner's ( I dread saying that
word now days) did not have the chance to deal with. A Non-PVP can meet a
PVP highwayman staking out a area of the road. Also, a Non-PVP can meet a
Non-PVP highwayman, doing the same, but by complete role-playing. Here is
where we, as gamers, must change the way we think.

Through countless hours of terror and running, most players have developed
shell shock when they are confronted with "a bandit in the woods" situation.
We have all gotten used to the "Die, Dudz" attitude that had run around UO
and had never been given the opportunity to role-play the situation. Here in
Everquest, we have the unique chance to be able to interact PVP and Non-PVP
and both parties leave with a sense of enjoyment.
