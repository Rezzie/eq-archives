Greetings everyone,
 <br><br>
I just received an e-mail from some turkey claiming to have made a proggie where you could "switch" between EQ (while running it) and windows. He added the program as an attachment, also claims to be from Norrath...the attachment I scanned and it came out to have the trojan ORIFICE2K the newer version of the now famous back orifice. 
<br><br>
He is obviously using hotmail to cover his ass....here his supposed email address
 <br><br>
kaneeq@hotmail.com
 <br><br>
subject is: A soul from Norrath
 <br><br>
The program as he calls it is    AltTab.exe   and is approximately 361k
 <br><br>
He sends this to everyone individually to make it less obvious...he also claims to have checked it over and over for bugs but "should"
there be any to let him know...He also states he is a 50th warrior..lol what a crock..
 <br><br>
Please pass this info to anyone you know or those I have missed.
 <br><br>
Should you receive this from him as well and it doesn't contain the trojan I would greatly appreciate being informed as I scanned it both McAffee and Norton, both had the same results.
 <br><br>
Lets hope my scanners are like major out of date but just in case..double check it should you receive it
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>

This is the first, and only, time that I've heard of this.  I can't verify any of this.  However, it seemed worthwhile to warn you about it, just in case.  Also it gives me a chance to suggest to you all that ANY third party software from a source that you don't know could be very bad for you.  How many times have you heard about some third party software hack for a game that steals passwords?
<br><br>
Generally, it's better to avoid third party software.

Oi! - what happened to Lil' Archy?
<br><br>
He was my favourite bit - well one of my favourite bits - they're all good :)

Hello Absor, I just want to say:
 <br><br>
"NOOOO!"
 <br><br>
Ritter, as an American, cannot comprehend what an ancient, boding evil he (she, maybe) has unleashed upon Norrath with the lyrics to "<a href="../Issue103/fields.htm">The Fields of Karana</a>" (Issue #103). 
 <br><br>
You may not understand, but you will, my friend, you will. When the original "Fields of Athenry" (by Pete 'Satan' St John) were published here, they swept across the land like a icy hand of death, making all music classes for students everywhere hell. Still puzzled, my cross-atlantic friend? Ah, I see you do not know about something called "The Syllabis"....
 <br><br>
Every year, a gathering of foul daemons known as "Scruduthoir an Teastas Soisearach" (Examiners of the Junior Certificate) would meet to decide what mistempered lyrical monstrosities that year's hapless candidates would have to brave in order to ensure survival. Those who failed this often lethal test would never be seen or heard from again. Those who pleased these daemons, wether by looks or by academic acomplishments, gained what can be rougly translated from Faa'nesh, or Examiner's Tongue, as a "pass".
 <br><br>
To cut a hideously extended tale to a thrilling demise, "The Fields of Athenry" was included almost every time. 
 <br><br>
I can still hear it now, on quiet nights, those terrible lyrics and that organ-jarringly bad accompniment....
 <br><br>
All I am saying is, be warned. For the power behind that song is belied by its seemingly innocent exterior.
 <br><br>
You have been warned.
 <br><br>

I love how you composed that song, the fields of Karana, it was quite good and fitting. I also enjoyed how you tied it in with an Irish folksong, since I am 68% Irish blood, grown in an Irish household, and a citizen of Ireland since birth. Irish songs have the best melody by which to celebrate, mourn, or relax. Our history has all such occasions, so we can easily achieve the melody by which to express the desired mood. I would enjoy hearing another of your great songs and look forward until the time that I do.

First off, many cheers to the EverQuest Express!
<br><br>
I noticed there is no Lil'Archy this week.  For whatever the reason, he will 
be missed by my friends and me.  It's definately the Doonesbury of 
EverQuest!  I hope there will be a Lil'Archy next week!
<br><br>
By the way, thanks for the "Archy at 50" article in issue #100!  It's worth 
it's print in gold (especially the Blackburrow gift shop strip)!

<em>Regarding Bard's Log</em>
<br><br>
Hey,
<br><br>
I just wanted to say I love your comic strip.  It always makes my laugh
after a hard day's work of killing orcs. Plus the drawings are great too =)
<br><br>
Thank you,<br>

<br><br>
Oh joy!
<br><br>
Well hello!
<br><br>
Just a quickie to say: I loooove your work! I love the art, anime-manga-style, the Gargatox's antics, his helmet, the lovely dark elf ladies, the bard, etc. Mmmmm... I need to draw again, been at it since I can hold a pen... and stopped for so long. =) Work wears off the mind...
<br><br>
Thanks a lot, and keep it up!!
