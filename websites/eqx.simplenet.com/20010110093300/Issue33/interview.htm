<p style="text-align: justify">

Sardonic is one of the site administrators at Crossroads of Norrath.  He stays on top of the news there.  I want to thank him for accepting my request for this interview.  Here is what he had to say.
<br><br>

<b>Razor:</b>  "Tell me about Crossroads of Norrath."
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>   "Well, the site is really dedicated to posting adequate news as of pre-beta.  But, if you remember Crossroads of Britannia, it should serve the same purposes.  It should have classifieds, a hero and a villain's list, and an active area for in-game, player-sponsored events.  As well as some sections on humor and of course."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>   "Maintaining a quality web site is a lot of work. What keeps you motivated to do all that work?" 
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b> "It does take a lot of motivation, to put quality news as of right now...It's hard to stay motivated due to the fact that I think some news sites are just under-valued.  Take for example CoN, or EQSS... A lot of people often say "We have to go to the EQVault if we want answers from Mr. McQuaid."  It's tough not being able to really "break" new stories on your own site.  But I get a lot of help from the site administrators.  They keep me on task, and it's also a lot of fun.  Not to mention I have a bit of free time." [<em>Laugh</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "I've read quite a bit of feedback regarding the NDA.   What do you think about the recent complaint from Brad about posting "Game" or "NDA information?"
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "Well, we did post some news I believe about the .5 beta.  The actual post was made by Follis Mortalis, who used to work for us and was a great news poster and site administrator.  I am a firm believer that it's all up in the air, and since we don't get a lot of news we may want to actually go out and find it.   But, we went to Mr. McQuaid and asked him if it was all right to post it, and he said "no" and it was gone.  We have to respect his wishes. If we can't have a good relationship with 989 then our site ceases to be.   It's more important to foster that relationship, than to report the news sometimes, although, many other "real" news organizations could have cared less.  
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "Every kid had heroes growing up. Who were your top three idols when you were young? Who are your top three now?"  
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b> "Hmm.  I wouldn't say I am old right now." [<em>Laugh</em>] Top three idols, God.... First was my cousin, then probably my dad.  I don't think I really had a third."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "Tell the readers who you are.  What are your hobbies, job, and or goals?"
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "Well, I am usually quiet, unassuming (this is in real-life), often over-sensitive, and extremely sarcastic hence the name.  My hobbies are mostly writing and computers.  I like listening to music, classic rock mostly.  I came to Crossroads when Follis asked for some help with posting news, and I agreed, and thus I became a part of the team.  Follis then left after a job promotion, and I handled news all by myself."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "What are your favorite games?"
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "EverQuest of course!"  [<em>Laugh</em>]  Close Combat, and Age of Empires, and Jedi Knight God I am picking all "Zone" Games.  Personally, I think Age of Empires is great.  Ever played that?"
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>   "As a matter of fact we play that quite a bit here.  Remember I have geeks for kids"  
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b> "And what about their parents?"
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "Um we are geeks too."
<br><br>
[<em>Laughter</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "Give us a recommendation about a book that we may not have read that you think we should."
 <br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b> "Hmm."  [<em>Silence</em>] "Catch-22 is one of my all time favorites, knowing the EQ crowd I don't think many have read this."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "I have seen this a lot on the different forums, but I feel it must be asked. In your opinion, where do you think Everquest will succeed where UO failed?
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b> "Well, since the game isn't out yet, I can't really tell, but here is what I hope.  I hope, on one end, they start treating us as "paying customers" rather than complainers. If the majority of the players want something done, then they should listen to it. I hope EQ can do this. Sometimes, it's hard but I hope EverQuest can realize that we are paying money for the game and deserve some respect.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "You don't think we got treated as customers in UO?"
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "NO!  In a game on this scale, it is important to foster a good relationship with the player. This is not a game like, Close Combat, where you sell it once and then done. You are constantly selling this to us every month.  I hope the players can also have the stamina, to say "If this doesn't work, then I will quit" Basically, I hope for just a little more respect from the EQ Team.  OSI just didn't give the player the respect he/she deserved.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "Do you feel that in an RPG setting that people should have vast character backgrounds? I have noticed quite a few have taken the time to write histories and dispositions for their characters. Do you condone this activity, or do you find it extreme?"
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  This activity is two-pronged. I, personally, love to write, and it's a part of my own enjoyment. On entering my guild, you must submit your "Character Profile" because we wanted to become a guild that followed up on the statement "We role-play" Role-play is with a dash. [<em>Laugh</em>] But, on the other side of the coin, a lot of people detest writing, they feel they can't do it. They should not be forced to do something they don't enjoy.  I think it has to be something of mutual respect. If you don't want to role-play, you don't have to, but respect the players who do.  And also, role-players, shouldn't become crusaders and/or parents to people whom don't.  Tolerance is key in any community, even one that is on-line.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "What type of history do you have with RPGs in general? How many pen and paper games have you played?"
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "I hate AD&D and all her works. She is the New Babylon.   But, I used to write my own pbem's.   PBeM's are play by e-mail games, my game was the "Enchanted Forest" Players could choose races I created, I must emphasize the I, and classes.  They would start out all by themselves and then meet up with others, to gain victory you must kill the players around you in the end.  But the ending had a twist, the only way to gain the "orb" was to reply the right answer to the Wizard.  The Question was "Would you kill Razor to gain the orb." Assume you are a player
If s/he said "yes" they would never gain it, if they said "no" then they would.  No one ever answered "no" and it was a huge brawl at the end.  Other than that, I played text MUD's and I made my own with two friends.  Two years ago, we were starting a graphical MUD, but that quickly fizzled out.  We just didn't have enough programmers or money to do it.  I am more of an idea/quest man myself.  I can think up all the monsters the areas etc.  Actually program them.  [<em>Laugh</em>].  Actually my friend was more the programmer. Having one programmer and one guy constantly coming up with great ideas was not a great combo."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "How long have you been a member of the EQ community? 
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "Well, I saw the first issue of EQX and I remember when it got mirrored on Gram's Place."  [<em>And it still is at http://www.gramsplace.com/eq/eqx/index.html</em>]   December was when I first heard about it.  I looked at the EQ web page and said Wow, this page is atrocious, how can they make a good game [<em>laugh</em>] and went on playing Ultima Online, until I saw the first screenshot, and from then on I became hooked.  You have to admit, that the first page was poorly designed."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "There has always been a huge debate over the pvp switch. What are your concerns regarding this topic and which side of the switch will you reside?"
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "+PvP, and I am going to be evil too.   I think that the switch is a great idea, IF AND ONLY IF, it is monitored.  I can't tell you how many posts I see saying "I will exploit the switch".  I enjoy role-playing, so I hope to keep it entertaining for both parties.  It is their death, why should it be so traumatizing.  My entire guild is based on that fact."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "Are you a hack and slash player, or a finesse player? Would you rather do the wetwork, or stand way back and shoot fireballs from a distance?"
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "Hack and slash is so dirty in the MUD World.  I don't call myself either actually.  I call myself a "Creative PK".  I use what is necessary to defeat my opponent.  A lot of people may say "hey, using that spell is a cheap kill", but, if it's in the game, I use it.  As, I said before, I like to make it enjoyable for the victim, and that sometimes takes finesse
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "When talking about game companies, do you think Quantity Vs Quality is out of control?
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b> "Actually, not really.  A lot of people buy a game cause others say its cool.   It's really got to be a choice.  Like Close Combat, it isn't great graphically, and it isn't well known, but, it is one of the best war games I have ever really played.  Now look at a popular game like Star Craft.  It isn't as good or as "Realistic" as close combat, but more people play it.  That doesn't make it better, and it doesn't mean it is ruining the game market. It just means people arnt searching enough."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "You mentioned you'd role-play a villain. What kind of character will you play? 
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "Ok, I am personally a Dark Elven Wizard, and male.  I just wanted to be an extra intellectual character, almost condescending.  My friend on it who is my partner in crime, is a Shadow Knight, we intend to make some stories.  As for the rest of my guild, it's a wide variety. I think people shouldn't have race exclusive guilds. I don't like racism in real life and I definitely don't want a significant race not being on my team."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "Do you feel EQ will live up to the name its fans are creating for it?  Why?
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "No.  Stone him! Stone him!  We are putting a tremendous amount of hype on it. That is really tough to live up to, in anything. There will always be problems with something. Invariably, people like to hear themselves talk. You won't get rid of "whiners" just put them in a different genre. You also aren't getting rid of rabid pk's. This game is only a game, not a heaven. But I believe it will be one of the most enjoyable games I have played."
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "If you had just one wish.  One thing you would like to see included in EQ.  What would it be? 
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "Gnome Tossing Catapults, and alterable breast sizes. 
<br><br>
[<em>We both laugh</em>]
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b>  "Wait can I put a wish?
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>  "Sure."
<br><br>
<b>Sardonic:</b> Ok, I would really love for Mr. McQuaid, to answer my interview request soon, and maybe visit CoN a little more."
<br><br>
Thanks for the interview Sardonic.
