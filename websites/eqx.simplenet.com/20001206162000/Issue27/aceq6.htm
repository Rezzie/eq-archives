Just because you haven't been handed it on a silver plater doesn't mean
it's not there..
<br><br>
<em>Asheron's Call is also associated with a huge company with lots of
resources and experience. But, the company is named Microsoft. How many
times has your Windows crashed? Hmmm. What happened to Bill Gates at his
big debut of Windows 98? Hmmm. I can only guess that AC realizes they have
a short term game here, and will be trying to push it out the door before
EQ sees the light. They will hope to get some addicts before the players
have a chance to compare it to EverQuest.</em>

I always find it funny how some people just can't understand what a developer
and a publisher are. Microsoft has absolutely nothing to do with the
programing of Asheron's Call, just as Sony's Playstation devision has nothing
to do with EQ. So, by this logic, if I don't like a playstation title, or
it has a bug, so will EQ, right?
<br><br>
While I expected this review to be completely biased since it's on an EQ
site, please do make sure that your information about AC is correct before
you compare (which, IMO is pretty useless when neither is available yet).

<u>Response:</u>
<br><br>
Thank you for your clarifications.  I agree that most information published
about a game before it has even reached beta is a "crap shoot", as I stated
in the article.  It has been stated in earlier articles about EverQuest that
anything and everything about the game as we know it could change before we
ever get our hands on it.  The same applies to Asheron's Call, I'm sure.  The
EverQuest vs Asheron's Call article was not meant to be a review, but merely
a comparison of what I saw and was told at E3.  It doesn't surprise me if I
misinterpreted something or the person giving a demo misstated something.
But the point was to get across an overall impression of the two games.  I
stand by my opinion that of the E3 versions of both games, EverQuest has a
clear advantage.  I will continue to watch both games very carefully to see
if this continues, and I'm sure everyone else will as well.
