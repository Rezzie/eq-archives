<em>I just wanted to thank all of you for writing in about the loss of Robert Wells.  In the time that I've been doing this, I've rarely received so many letters.  I'm very grateful to be a member of the EverQuest community.</em>

<br><br><br>
Dear Absor:
<br><br>
I just finished reading your <a href="../Issue110/edita.htm">editorial</a> and letter from Robert Wells; the boy with Hodgkin's disease.  I must admit that I was moved to the point of getting slightly "teary eyed".  I don't know why Robert's situation struck me the way it did.  Maybe it's the strong emotions conveyed in his letter and your editorial.  Whatever the reason, I thank you very much for sharing this emotional issue.
 <br><br>
This issue brings to light one reason why games; whether table-top or computer, are enjoyed by so many people.  It's not so much the game itself but rather the emotional and personal connections a person makes while interacting with others.  That's the primary reason I play games with my friends on the weekends. I enjoy the social interaction.  I wholly support any activity that brings people together and allow them to enhance their lives whether it's a computer game or a poetry reading.
 <br><br>
The amazing thing about this issue is that I don't even play Everquest.  However, after your editorial I am strongly considering picking up a copy and giving it a try.
 <br><br>
Best Wishes
 <br><br>

Issue 110. Absor's editorial...
<br><br>
I Never write in. I often just skip thru any article that obviously isn't dealing with some big "issue" happening in EQ. But man....that letter and your comments truly opened my eyes to what I have been ignoring in EQ. Some of these people are the only real "friends" I have. Losing them would feel every bit as painful as loosing a real life loved one. Reading that man's letter and then being hit with the fact that he had died, hurt.
 <br><br>
I want to thank you for reminding me how much my friends in EQ really mean to me.  I needed to remember that amid the constant struggle for levels/items/status that I really do care for these people who have become my second family. 
 <br><br>
Thank you,<br>

Thank you for sharing that story.  It brought tears to my eyes.

<em>On a lighter note...</em>
<br><br>
Just read your article on the server emulator. Just thought you should take into account the fact that if Varant weren't a bunch of pricks who actually listened to customer feedback and cared about the people that put food on their tables the people making the emulator would be wasting their time. But Varant doesn't care so screw them.

<em>Well that's a hard letter to respond to...
 <br><br>
Let me try it this way:
 <br><br>
    What the hell is wrong with you?
 <br><br>
  Absor</em>
<br><br><br>
Nothing is wrong with me, I am just tired of Verant and tired of those who defend them. 2 of my lvl 20+ characters were accidentally deleted with not so much as a "sorry" from Verant. This pissed me off pretty good, now 2 months later I HAD a 30+ wizard that I can't even use now because of a bug. Me and a bunch of other people got banned for no reason, and when I wrote Verant about it 3 weeks ago I got an automatic reply and haven't heard anything since. So I completely support anyone coming up with server emulator software. In fact if Verant released the software themselves I'd be willing to pay THEM just to be able to play on a server that wasn't run by them. But they don't give a damn about the people that keep them in business so I doubt this will ever happen.

To Synron, Absor,
<br><br>
	Vendui`. I am the "Briza" character <a href="../Issue110/letters.htm">complained about</a> in last week's
issue of EQX. As a response to the claim that it is unoriginal, yes, it is.
I can vaguely see how an unoriginal name would be insulting, creativity
being a very important thing to us roleplayers, a sort of quality that binds
the culture together. And names are the only unique thing we have about
ourselves, so my usage of Briza's name would break a certain kind of taboo,
I suppose. If you are offended by my name, I apologize. Yes, I did copy
Briza straight out of Salvador's novels, she was my first character, and I
looked to the creator of dark elves for inspiration on what her name should
be. Now, later in my EQ life, I justify it by thinking, perhaps "Briza" is a
common female Teir'Dal name... one never knows. Not everyone has a unique
name. Are our names in real life unique? I think not! Why would the fantasy
world of Norrath be any different (other than for technical reasons)?
<br><br>
As for your claim that you will never play with or help anyone with an
unoriginal name, Synron, shame on you! Snubbing someone on the basis of just
a name is going a little far. It is easy to stereotype, but stereotypes are
often wrong.
<br><br>
I hope I have the chance to play with each of you online someday, I think
you will find me more like yourself than you realize. And you never know who
I might be. . . .

Just thought I'd drop a note and say that I've enjoyed Larch Arrowsmithe
art work.  And if you could pass this on to him.
