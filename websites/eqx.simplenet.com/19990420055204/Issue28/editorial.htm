<em>Wow</em>.  I just finished indexing ALL of the articles, stories and letters ever written for EverQuest Express for our new 'About Us' page.  <em>Wow</em>.  It took longer than it should have because I had to stop and read some of them again.  It made me realize why EQX seems to be so popular.  I got lucky, that's why.  None of our writers know that I'm going to write this, and I imagine that they are going to chastise me for it, but I have no choice.  The writers that we have had over the last 28 issues (geez, that's 7 months!) have been fantastic!  I fondly remember Malaclypse and her story about FETTP!  Where are you Mal?  Jaga only wrote one article, but he inspired me to think and helped me out a lot behind the scenes.  And have you read Archinalia's Mirror Lake?  Do it.  I will always be a great fan of Ian Ash for that article/tale where he transformed a squabble in the newsgroups and chat boards into a tale of epic proportions and called it Trouble in the Commons.
<br><br>
Then we snagged Oghma.  He turned his keen eye to all sorts of roleplaying issues, and we flourished.  Dach, well known in EQ circles, joined us and again we flourished.  Razor…  Hell, Razor single-handedly had made me smile more than I have a right too.  And Wynn, well, you all know about him. :)  Now we get lucky and Elaanilus Nazgul comes on board.  And there are sooo many others.  Our readers send us some great letters, always keeping me honest.  I'm afraid to stop, I don't want to leave anyone out.  But they all know it.  These folks have made EQX what it is.  And I wanted to say thanks, thanks to you all.

<br><br>
Well, enough of that!
<br><br>
I also wanted to comment about the idea of web sites publishing EverQuest secrets and spoilers.  The basic idea is pretty simple.  Some folks think that it would hurt the game if sites post things like complete spell lists (which Sony says they do not intend to publish), maps to secret areas and guides on "maxing out" each class and race.  They feel that discovering such things is a large part of the fun of such games.
<br><br>
Others believe that there is no reason for any particular web site not to publish such things, as they will invariably make it onto the net.  These folks feel that it is their duty to bring as much information to their readers, and that includes such spoilers.
<br><br>
While this is a simplification of the issue, I think you get the idea.  As always there will be people between the two extremes.
<br><br>
Now, if I tell you that EQX will publish all information that does not specifically break the NDA, I will be considered a traitor to the "purist" out there that believe I would be helping to spoil their game.
<br><br>
If I tell you that EQX will not publish spoilers or anything that might be "secret", I will be branded a Sony suck up.
<br><br>
Luckily, despite my sudden notoriety among the EverQuest crowd, I don't really care what people think about my morality.  I can tolerate being disliked or called names.  No problem.  Hehe, if you did my job for a day, you'd understand why.
<br><br>
Well, it just so happens that I am a purist.  EverQuest Express will not publish anything that <b>I</b> think would lessen <b>my</b> game experience.  So you will not find spoilers or maps or any such thing on this site.
<br><br>
Obviously I have no control over what happens on other sites.  However, I would like to encourage all the site managers/web masters (isn't <em>that</em> an arrogant sounding term?) to consider taking the "high road" and join me in this.  Even if you are certain that it will cost you hits (it won't as long as you have a quality site) or that it is a fruitless gesture, do it anyway.  I've always had only one idea about morality: be true to yourself.
<br><br>
Hmmm...  My DM is going on vacation (teachers, hah!) soon, and tomorrow will be his last game for a long while.  I hope he does something annoying or even, heaven forbid, inspiring for me to write about next time.  All this moralizing and mushy sucking up to the writers is giving me a headache.
