<H1> Q & A </H1>
<HR>
<br>
<I><B>Q:</B> Is killing monsters the only way to gain experience? Or will using certain skills also gain experience, ie for the non-heavy killing classes, such as a rogue disarming a trap?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> You will not gain experience for using skills.  However, killing monsters is not the only way, either.  As the name of the game implies, quests will be a significant part of the game.  The rewards for completing a quest include experience, items, and faction changes.  One person in the beta program has claimed to have achieved level 5 purely through questing.  

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> I've seen several screen shots where characters were using two weapons at once.  How does this work?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Some classes gain the Dual Wield skill at various levels.  This allows them to wield two one-handed weapons at the same time.  This allows the character to get in an extra attack whenever the dual wield skill triggers.  Obviously the higher the skill, the more often the extra attack will occur.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Will players be allowed to fly dragons?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> No.  Most players will probably not even see a dragon, let alone fly one.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Will bard instruments be visible to other players?  In another game, bards could play their instruments from inside their backpacks.</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Bard instruments are visible to other players, when they are being used.  All bard songs can be executed purely by singing, but the use of an instrument will increase the effects of the spell.  In order to use the instrument, it must be wielded, and as such it will be shown on your character.
 
<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Do bard song effects wear out after the song is over, or does it linger for a while?  Must you continue playing in order for the magical effects to continue?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Bard songs are all cyclical.  That means the spell effect will trigger every several seconds, as long as the bard continues to sing.  When the bard stops the song, the spell effect will wear off after a few seconds.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>If a tree falls on a bard in a forest with no one around, do the bears eat him?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>After meditating on this extensively, I have achieved a new level of enlightenment.  I shall not rob you of this experience by revealing the answer.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>In the period of time between death and retrieving your possessions from your corpse, can your corpse be looted by wandering monsters or players?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Monsters will never loot your corpse.  Another player can only loot your corpse if he is the one who killed you, or you have granted him permission to do so. 

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>What is the time limit to get back to your corpse?  What happens to your items if you don't get back in time?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>The time limit is dependent upon your level.  At low levels, you have less time to get back to it, which really shouldn't be a problem.  You wont be wandering far from home at low levels any way.  At higher levels, you have eight hours to reach your corpse.  You should be able to go from one end of the world to the other in less time than this.  If you fail to reach your corpse within this time, the corpse will vanish, along with any items that were on it.

  <BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>As I read some previews, I discovered that there are many more skills in EQ than described on the EQ web site.  Does an actual list break the NDA, or why isn't there one?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> The EverQuest development team can put whatever they wish to release on the main EQ web site.  Some of us fan sites have been released from the NDA, which means legally we can publish whatever we want, including lists.  However, EverQuest Express will not publish lists of skills, equipment, quests, or anything else, as we consider such lists to be spoilers.  It is much more enjoyable to play a game and discover things on your own.

 <BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>It seems to me that the enchanter class is almost a watered-down spell caster.  Their spells aren't overpowering and seem barely manipulative.  I was wondering how balanced the magic classes really are and if, in fact, enchanters can make magic items?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Enchanter spells are one of the last to be implemented and balanced, and as such they currently appear "weaker" than other spell casters.  However, once their abilities are fully implemented, they will be balanced along with every other class in the game.  Enchanters should be able to put magical effects into items, such as resistences in armor and damage effects in weapons.
