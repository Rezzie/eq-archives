	<big><big>T</big></big>hinking of making an EQ site, but are discouraged by all the sites that seem to be popping up lately?  Or perhaps you are more concerned by not being able to compete with the large sites out there.  Well don't because you can beat the crap out of any of the EQ sites out there, you just have to have a little motivation, creativity, and patience.  Join me in my third of a four part series on how to create an EverQuest page that will get noticed.

Now that you have your page layout done, and some page associating graphics, you need to begin filling in the page.  You need this to be well written, professional, and informative no matter what the subject.  Your object should be to try to lean away from the norm of pages and into the abnormal.
<br><br>
If you want people to come back to your site, you have to have the info to make them do so.  You have to update constantly (you might want to think of getting an extra helping hand or two).  You have to be correct in all that you say on a page.  If you are a EQ news page for example (or any news page at that), it’s <B>not</B> a good idea to have incorrect info on the page.  Even the slightest mistake can cost you many hits.  So make what you put up worth the while.  If you just want to update and aren’t sure on the info you have, don’t update!  It is better to have a lack of updates rather than to misinform everyone.

Now that that is out of our way, decide once and for all what your main focus is going to be.  Are you going to handle EQ news?  Guild News?  Articles?  Class/Race info?  Let me stress that there are many EQ news sites out there and that you should go towards the more original type pages but not because you can’t do better than them!  Class/Race specific pages haven’t shown up yet, maybe you would like to do one of those?  No matter what, it will be up to you.  So decide and let’s move on.

<B>What Not’s</B>
<br><BR>
There are just some things you really don’t need to do on your page.  Using a lot of Java is one of them (I would stress none at all unless you are a Java God and can actually make decent, fast loading Java).  Once again we fall into that pit of people who have older browsers.  Many do not support Java, and even the ones that do sometimes have trouble with it.  So no matter how cool that you think being able to use it to make descriptions of links is, it certainly isn’t worth making many people have tons of Java Errors or not be able to view it at all.  Try to keep it simply HTML (but well done HTML) or something you KNOW is supported by most browsers.  Remember, it’s the content that counts (but of course, your page has to look nice enough to keep someone there long enough to get to the content).  Yet again, don't use browser specific features for obvious reasons.<BR>

With this in mind, you will be ready for my finally barrage of tips for you aspiring webmasters.  I stress for the last time that you keep your site updated and original.  Originality is everything.  If you show that you can pull away from the common mold, people will see that you have a mind of your own (or at least you seem like it) and that you think for yourself, which makes you look all the more a competent webmaster.  Oh, and as a few webmasters have told me to point this out (and it is a good idea to do so)...make the page enjoyable for <U>you</U>.  Sure you want to please everyone, but you need to please yourself as well.  Once updating starts being a chore, then you might as well stop doing your page because you’ve already missed the point of doing one in the first place (unless you are a money grubber).  Brainstorm some ideas that might give your page an edge until next week, where I will discuss the etiquette of the net (or netiquette) and how to advertise without going overboard (and other stuff if I can think of it).
