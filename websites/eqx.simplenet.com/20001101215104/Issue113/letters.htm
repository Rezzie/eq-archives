everquest emulator - please read
<br><br>
im not one of those people who just yels insults so ill give you my honest opinion. I think the everquest emulator is a great idea but i know it will hardly be used. a game like everquest is all about mass multiplayer, if you were in a zone with ONLY 3 people (your friends) would it be quite the same experience? The good thing about the emulator is that all the kids in the world that dont have the money needed to give them their EQ fix every month can play without having to spend every penny they have. another good thing is if somone sets up a internet server for thousands of ppl it will keep all the cheaters and lameasses out of the clean cheatfree workd of norrath. Correct me if im wrong but verant has one of the bestsellers around, the cost of the game (without monthly fee) is the same as most games out there. now take a second to add up a couple of million players paying their (whatever it is.. like $15 a month) and multiply by one year! (or 12 if you wish)
now how mush are they making?? how much more than games like diablo (which had free multiplayer) are they making?
anyway.. if u wanna flame me (and if u even read this)
you can do so at (e-mail address deleted).

<br><br>
<em>I'm certainly not going to flame you.
 <br><br>
But you see, here's the problem.  Those kids that are not paying their $10 a month to Verant to play, are essentially stealing three years of labor from the 20 or so people on the EQ team.  They've worked very hard to earn their success and the money that it brings.  How fair is it to take that from them?
 <br><br>
Me, I'm waiting for Neverwinter Nights so that I can play with just a few of my freinds in a world that I've designed.  But that's not what EQ is about.

It's been a while since I read EQX, and I just caught your letters section
in the last issue and your editorial in the current. I feel they're
connected somehow, so please bear with me here...
<br><br>
Everquest is a video game. It is not a game in which a GM will tailor the
world to you and make sure everyone has fun. In short, it is not a
role-playing game. It was tagged with the title of "RPG" along with several
hundred other games released in 99. 
<br><br>
I find something very odd with the complaints in both EQ and UO about the
lack of role-playing. I've played Baldur's Gate, the entire FF series, and
countless other games marked RPG on the box. Never once have I seen a post
where someone was complaining about the lack of personalized
character-based plot. Why should this game be any different? RPG is a
gaming industry term for anything involving levels, fantasy, or a plot with
decent depth. That's all it ever will be.
<br><br>
You hit the whole point of the EQ experience in your editorial. It's about
having fun with others. Many, many players see it's nothing more than an
IRC channel with a permanent topic and activity. Personally I was always
very polite and friendly while playing, but some others were not. This is
what you expect in any multiplayer game. Whether it's the spamming jerks in
Quake, the newbie pks in Diablo and UO, or the consistent morons in EQ.
They exist in every multiplayer game.
<br><br>
This all happens because it is a video game and not some sort of RPG.
Anyone with $30 and a computer can join. Much like the campers in 3d
shooters, they have just as much right to be there as you do. In the end,
it all comes down to the people in a 3d IRC channel. Perhaps when the
emulated servers start popping up, we'll all be much happier playing and
less irritated by the more disruptive players.

Yes, the RPG label is a misleading one, because paper and pen roleplayers
have a much different experience in "Role-playing Games" than computer
gamers.  Paper and pen always gives a much better level of interaction than
any computer game can offer - it's not the game designers fault, the medium
is still limited in that sense, but what they offer now is not a bad
compromise, to me.
<br><br>
More and more i think it's the community which makes or breaks the game.
If a new player comes in and gets treated well, then they will enjoy the EQ
experience.  If they meet with harrassing Kill-stealers, well, their
experience of multiplayer "RPGS" will be a negative one.
<br><br>
Thank you for your letter!
