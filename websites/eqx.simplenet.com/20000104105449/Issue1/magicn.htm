And that is also the case in Everquest. In some of the most played RPGs of recent time like Diablo and Ultima Online magic was a pretty big part of the game but it did the magic system was not big at all. In Diablo there was approximately 32 spells that were used and in Ultima Online there is approximately 64 spells that you can use. But in Everquest there is 5 schools of magic with their own unique spells and there have been rumors of the Bard class even having magical songs that they can sing. Here are only 2 of the types of magic that will be in Everquest. Now there has not been much info given out by the EQ staff so some of this is going to be the given info and speculations.

<CENTER><B>Necromancy</P> </B></CENTER>
<P>
The first type of magic is Necromancy. If you choose your character to become a Necromancer well then you can't use any of the things that go along with the other schools of magic.&nbsp; To be a Necromancer you will most likely have to be of bad notoriety since you will summoning undead which are most likely always evil. The types of undead that can be summoned or unknown right now but will most likely be the same types of undead in most of the other RPGs. For example, you will probly be able to summon skeletons, zombies, ghosts, and hopefully maybe even liches.
</TD><TD  height="387" style="text-align: justify" WIDTH=240><P align="JUSTIFY">A Necromancer will probly not be able to summon the stronger types of undead to keep him from being too powerful, but you never know. If the EQ staff does let Necromancers summon the more powerful undead as they become more powerful then they will probly be summoning vampires, werewolves, wraiths, along with some other strong undead.

<CENTER><B>Enchantment</P> </B></CENTER>
<P>
The next type of magic that there is in Everquest is called Enchantment. Now being an Enchanter could very well be a profitable business. One of the powers as an Enchanter is the power to magically enchant weapons, armor, and mabye they will be able to enchant other items besides weapons and armor. An Enchanter could make a good living simply by using their power. They start a weapons shop and have the weapons enchanted and sold which would make a lot of money for them in the long run. They can also enchant weapons of traveling Warriors for a price. <BR>
<BR>
Now many of the players that are used to being a Warrior and like it a lot can take advantage of the Enchanter class. This could be done by having your Warrior already and then making an Enchanter character that would only be used for your Warrior's weapons and armor. There was also a discussion about this on the Everquest newsgroup.
</TD><TD  height="387" WIDTH=247><P align="JUSTIFY">Here is some of the message that Brad McQuaid (Everquest Producer) posted on the newsgroup about this subject. &quot;<I><B> If you want to make an enchanter to enchant some weapons of yours, and he only exists to do that, and you give those weapons to your warrior, I really don't care. I don't consider that abusive (and, btw, 'enchant weapon' is most likely not going to be a first level enchanter spell.</B></I>&quot; So as you can see it will not be considered cheating or anything like that but you will probably have to play a little bit with your Enchanter in order to get him to be able to cast Enchant Weapon for you. Then by the time you've built your Enchanter up to that level you may even want to continue to use him instead of your Warrior. </P>
<P align="JUSTIFY">
The class of Enchantment will probly turn out to be a very good choice for a character who wishes to make money, help people out at the same time, and also still be involved with magic. Usually characters of magic don't have many ways to make money besides maybe inscribing spells but atleast this class can make money. </P>
