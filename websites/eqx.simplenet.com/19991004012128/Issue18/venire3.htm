Across the room the dummy raised off the floor.  His appendages started to sway
about, and his legs jumped.  
<br><br>
"He’s dancing" I laughed.  
<br><br>
Gosling concentrated on his spell.  I watched as the dummy moved towards the table
in front of us.  The dummy, which was a shirt sewn to a pair of pants and filled with
orange-yellow straw, picked up Gosling’s quaterstaff and readied it, then started
towards me.  As he approached he rotated the staff.

"Hey stop that!" I laughed.
<br><br>
The dummy moved close to me.  Then with a quick twist of his body, rotated the staff
down and upward, cutting out my legs from beneath me.  I landed in a heap on the
floor.  Gosling laughed as the dummy’s dropped lifeless to the floor. Embarrassed, I
picked myself off the floor, and  regained my posture.
<br><br>
"You see my son, the element of surprise can save your life."

I nodded my head in acknowledgment.  
<br><br>
"Red said he heard of powerful mages raising the dead.  Can I learn this grandfather?"
<br><br>
Red was my best friend.  We had met at the Qeynos stables where I have worked since
I was fifteen.  Gosling’s face hardened, and his thick black eyebrows lowered.
