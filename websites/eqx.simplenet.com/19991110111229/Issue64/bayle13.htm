<p style="text-align: justify">


Fineous yawned and stretched, the hides of his bed creaking as he turned to sit on its edge.  Standing and scratching his stomach, he walked over and pulled the skin aside from the window.  The morning sun shone in from the deserts of Ro, painfully bright on his hungover eyes.
<br><br>
Growling and covering the window again, he walked over to his bed, picked up his leathers and put them on awkwardly, hopping on one foot and falling back onto his bed pulling his boots on.  Standing again, clomping his boots into place, he turned and walked towards his dresser and picked up his belts.
<br><br>
Sword belt around his waist, another around his chest, sliding both short swords into place in their scabbards, he then paused to regard himself in the large bronze mirror against the wall.
<br><br>
"Damn, you're handsome," he said to himself, winking slyly at his reflection.  "Well, off to work."
<br><br>
Opening his door, he stepped out into the morning air, the smell of sand and sea mixing with the random detritus of humanity at its best.  He took a deep breath and smiled.  "Freeport, the greatest city in the world!" he shouted, then ducked as merchants and craftsmen from the nearby stalls threw things at him with calls to "Shut up!"  
<br><br>
Fineous laughed and ducked the debris, darting through the stalls and coming out on the main thoroughfare that passed for a street in the Eastern section of Freeport.  With a bounce in his step, he made his way to a stall to buy a stickybun and some of the blood red juice from the farms in Northern Ro.  Moving through the crowds, licking the caramel from his fingertips and wincing from the sourness of the juice, he made his way West through town, studiously avoiding the more Northern routes.
<br><br>
Smiling around the bun at the Militia, he nodded and waved, saluting some, making faces at others.  He knew all of them and worked well with most of them, turning a tidy profit now and again.  Skirting the morning crowds, walking up along the outer wall and gazing out over the desert, he smiled more.  Fineous loved the desert and blessed his parents, whoever they were, for bringing him here to be raised.  A young man could make a fortune out here, and Fineous was well on his way to doing just that.
<br><br>
Jogging along the parapet, anxious to make it to the West Gate as quickly as possible, he fantasized to himself that, one day, he'd make as much as the legendary Carson McCabe.  Now THERE was a man that could smell an opportunity a mile away, and had the capital to cash in on it.  And now he's one of the richest men in all of Antonica, owner and operator of all of High Hold, including the High Pass Casino and part owner of every bar, tavern, and shop in the Pass.
<br><br>
Shaking his head, he hurried along.  He'd never get rich dreaming about it.  It was time to get to work.  Sliding down the steps to the West Gate Courtyard, he rounded the corner and looked around.  Smiling to himself that he'd not missed the morning caravan, he found his spot on the wall and made himself comfortable.
<br><br>
The West Gate is the inland artery to all of Antonica for Freeport.  Goods came in through those arches from Rivervale, Qeynos, Halas, and as far away as Erud itself, all to be bought and sold in the Markets of Freeport, Trading Hub to the World.  Even the elusive Teir'dal pedaled their dark wares here, usually through human agents, though now and again the blue-skinned folk could be seen walking the streets at night.
<br><br>
Fineous watched curiously as a caravan creaked in, the wagons swaying back and forth as they circled up outside the arches and groaned to a stop in the open ground outside the city.  The drovers climbed down from their seats and began securing the animals while merchants started unsecuring cargo.  Passengers, travelers, and other folks began detaching from the group and heading towards the arched entrance to the city.
<br><br>
Carefully appraising the group, Fineous determined that this was a Qeynos caravan, though the pair of Erudites in the group and the Barbarian guards implied a more varied origin.  He mentally sorted through the people as they walked towards him, finally settling upon a couple that appeared suitable to his needs.  Dusting himself off and mentally getting his banter in place, he sauntered over to them.
<br><br>
"Hail, and welcome to Freeport, trading capital of Norrath.  How may the Escorts Guild serve you?"  Fineous bowed deeply before the couple, assessing their net worth as being fairly high from the cut of their clothing and the style of their shoes.
<br><br>
"Escort Guild?  I've never heard of such a thing," said the gentleman, tugging at his beard with one hand, his other pulling his lady to him possessively.  "What do you do?"
<br><br>
"Why, I escort, of course."  Fineous smiled winningly, his white teeth sparkling in the morning sunlight.  "Freeport is a big, complex city and it is easy to get lost.  My guildmates and I act as tourguide, information booth, and bodyguard all in one, making sure visitors to Freeport find everything to their satisfaction… for a small fee, of course."
<br><br>
"Of course."  The gentleman frowned and regarded his lady, who was gazing about at the high, sandstone walls in wonder, obviously never having seen such a remarkable city.  She returned his gaze, looked at Fineous, looked again at her man, then shrugged.  The gentleman's frown deepened and he turned once again to Fineous.  "I am here on business, but my wife insisted on coming as she has never been to the West before.  My business is not for a few days and a tour of the city might be nice… how much?"
<br><br>
"For you and your wife, I would be honoured to spend the day showing you around my lovely city for… 1 gold Qeynos damark."  Fineous held out his hand in greeting.  "I am Fineous."
<br><br>
"Sandall Coopersmith."  Sandall clasp Fineous' hand firmly, closing the deal, then released it and gestured to his lady, "and this is my wife, Kimera." 
<br><br>
Kimera smiled prettily and curtsied.  Fineous bowed deeply, then turned swept his arm out to indicate the city.  "We have a big day ahead of us, so let us be off."
<br><br>
As they walked, Fineous would turn and walk backwards, talking to his charges about this building or that, discoursing at great length on the history of the city.  "And here, on your right, you see the barracks of the City Militia.  Freeport, being the hub of trade that it is, is in frequent need of protection from those that would seek to plunder its riches.  Many enemies, from the Teir'dal in the West to the dervishes, Trolls, and Ogres from the South, seek to stab into the heart of our city and rape her of her wealth.  The militia's stout defenders prevent that."  As they rounded a corner, a scarlet liveried militiaman stopped in front of them, having just exited the barracks.  "Ahh, here you see an example of our city's finest.  Hail and well met, honorable soldier."  
<br><br>
Fineous extended his hand in greeting, a silver coin palmed discretely within it.  The soldier took the proffered hand and coin, slipping the money into his pocket and nodding.  He smiled broadly beneath his helmet at the visitors.
<br><br>
"Welcome to Freeport, travelers.  You are in good hands with this one, he will take care of you."  The soldier tipped his helmet slightly, then made his way around the group and continued on his errand.
<br><br>
Fineous considered making further comment about the militia, but did not want to lay it on too thick.  Indicating they should continue, he turned and walked up the street, his charges in tow.  After walking a couple of blocks, he paused again and indicated a large, columnar structure ahead of them.
<br><br>
"This is the famous Freeport Arena.  This imposing structure is the home to all the justice in Freeport.  Citizens that wish to resolve differences, criminals that wish to fight for their freedom, and gladiators that wish to prove their prowess all come here to fight for the crowds."  As if on cue, the roar of a crowd came from the structure, along with the clang of steel on steel.  "Ahh, a match is in progress.  Come, let us view from the gallery."
<br><br>
Fineous led them up the stone steps to the bleachers and paused, letting them soak in the scene.  The huge, sand-floored pit was surrounded by a wall 15' high, and the wall was topped with row-upon-row of stone bleachers.  The bleachers were only ½ filled, and the podium across the arena from the steps, where the Duke usually sat, was empty.  Down in the arena itself, two figures fought; one with a short sword and dagger, the other with a bastard sword and shield.  Fineous assessed the situation quickly, then turned to his employers.
<br><br>
"Here you see Freeport justice in action.  The gentleman with the shield is the champion of a local merchant, fighting for the honour of his employer.  The other fighter is a rogue, accused of robbing the merchant.  Instead of going before the magistrate and risking whatever summary justice that august body might mete out, he opted to accept the challenge of the merchant and fight for his innocence.  As you well know, if he is truly innocent his gods will protect him and he will prevail.  If he is guilty… well, we'll see."
<br><br>
The trio stood atop the steps and watched the match with interest.  Fineous rooted for the one with the shield both because it looked good to his employers and because the day before he had placed a large sum of money on this gladiatorial match, knowing that the shield-wielder was favored to win.  Sure enough, after a few moments, the warrior with 2 swords lie upon the sand, not moving.
<br><br>
Before the results could be announced, Fineous ushered his employers down the steps and away from the arena, saying "No need to see more, as I've no desire to offend the lady with such gruesome images."
<br><br>
The couple chuckled and this Kimera spoke up.  "Not at all.  I've attended many such matches at the Grounds of Fate in Qeynos and seen far worse.  It's rather comforting to see that Freeport handles justice just as effectively."
<br><br>
Fineous nodded sagely.  "Qeynos is known throughout the world for its fair and just leaders.  The militia frequently speak of Antonius Bayle himself as their inspiration, using him as an example for how upholders of the law SHOULD act."  The thief turned to lead them away, having to hide his smirk at such a lie.  The thought of the local militia doing anything but cursing the name of Bayle made him chuckle to himself.
<br><br>
As they made their way down the street, headed East, Fineous spotted an associate of his that reminded him of something.  He stopped and asked his employers, "Ahh, before we go much further, where will I need to take you after the tour?  To what Inn did you have the caravan master take your possessions?"
<br><br>
Sandall frowned for a second, then said, "I believe he said the name was the Jade Tiger.  Its in Northern Freeport."
<br><br>
Fineous nodded, "It is indeed.  A fine establishment.  I'll adjust our course to bring you there at the end of our tour."  He faced away from the couple, continuing their tour, and make a series of obscure hand gestures out of sight of them, explaining to his partner which Inn the couple's things had been brought too.  His partner acknowledge with another handsign and Fineous nodded.  The couple's things would be looted within the hour, leaving nothing of value, and the caravan master would be blamed.
<br><br>
As they passed through the Northern part of Freeport, the towering blue spire of the Temple of Mathaniel Marr came into view.  Kimera spotted it and gasped.  "It's beautiful!" she exclaimed.  "Can we go see it?"
<br><br>
Fineous frowned with a reluctance not totally feigned.  "We can try, though that is in the Paladin section of the city."
<br><br>
"Paladins?"  Sandall appeared confused.  "Why would that be a problem?  They are the defenders of the temple, the warriors of Light and Truth, as I've heard it told."
<br><br>
"I had hoped to avoid showing you this part of the Freeport as it is the shame of my city and, frankly, I'm embarrassed for you to see it."  Fineous sighed resignedly, "but the customer is always right."
<br><br>
He began moving towards the tall blue building, speaking again of the various buildings as they passed them, talking of the rich history of the city, pausing now and again when a particular story took longer than a couple of moments.  Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted the brilliant livery of a Paladin hurrying along the street, obviously headed to the barracks.  He watched the man walking, mentally timing his rate of movement and direction, then led the couple the other direction around the block.  Counting steps in his head quietly, he timed his movements with those he predicted the Paladin was making.  As he reached a corner, he turned to face his employers and walked backwards, speaking grandly of this building or that, his face lit up with enthusiasm over the story when the Paladin rounded the corner and smashed into him.
<br><br>
Fineous rebounded from the plate clad Paladin with a great deal more force than he was hit with, tumbling to the ground in the appearance of having been hit very hard.  The Paladin glared down at the rogue, his hand going to the sword at his hip reflexively.  "Watch where you're going, cur!" he barked.
<br><br>
The rogue rose to his knees, one hand clutching his side in obvious pain, his face pressed to the ground.  "Please, oh mighty warrior of Marr, do not strike me dead for my transgression.  I humbly grovel at your feet for forgiveness."  Inwardly he chuckled, knowing how much obeisance infuriated the Paladins of Marr.
<br><br>
The Paladin snarled, his hand squeezing the grip of his sword tightly, then spit on Fineous and walked away, stepping over him as he was a piece of offal, never paying the slightest heed to the Coopersmiths just around the corner.
<br><br>
After the Paladin disappeared into a building, Fineous painfully got to his feet and made a show of dusting himself off and trying to recover his pride.  "I'm sorry you had to see that.  The Paladins of Marr are… different."
<br><br>
Kimera was shocked and amazed.  "He was going to kill you!  It was his fault and he would have killed you!  How can that be?"
<br><br>
"They rule this part of the city with an iron hand.  On occasion, they even strike down members of the militia that 'offend' them."  Fineous failed to mention that these 'offenses' usually included public drunkeness and accepting bribes.  "Marr is very powerful here and the magistrates are afraid to cross the priests, which means the Paladins have free reign."
<br><br>
Sandall shook his head.  "The Paladins of Rodicet Nife are nothing like this.  They are kind and generous to a fault.  Please, take us somewhere else - I've seen enough of this part of town."
<br><br>
Fineous nodded mutely and headed East.  They passed by the Bard College and tunes drifted out through the open doors.  "This is much larger than the Bard Guild in Qeynos," Kimera commented.
<br><br>
"The Freeport Bard College is the greatest collection of knowledge and music in all of Norrath," Fineous stated proudly.  "Jythri himself has played here many times."
<br><br>
Sandall looked impressed.  "I had the pleasure of hearing Jythri perform in Qeynos a couple of months ago.  He is truly amazing."
<br><br>
Fineous led them into Eastern Freeport and down a ramp into the lower part of the city.  As they walked, Fineous kept up his banter, describing in great detail the history of the various sections of the city as they passed through them.  They walked in front of an abandoned building when Kimera squeaked in surprise and her scream was cut off.  The two men turned to see a third man holding Sandall's wife from behind, his hand over her mouth and a knife at her throat.  Behind the assailant stood two other men, both with swords bared.
<br><br>
"In the building, fools.  Now."  The largest of the muggers waved his sword at the door to the abandoned building.  The man holding Kimera drug her into the building and the leader motioned again at the door.
<br><br>
Fineous glanced around quickly, assessing the situation, then reluctantly entered the building, Sandall behind him.  The mugger holding Kimera stood between the two with swords while the larger one, obviously the leader, approached Sandall.  "I'll be taking your purse and any jewelry you two have."
<br><br>
Fineous stepped forward, one hand on his sword, and said "You'll be doing no such thing.  These people are under the protection of the Escort's Guild."
<br><br>
"Escort's Guild?  Bah, that group of peacocks could not protect a dungheap.  Stand aside, boy, or you'll be taught a lesson by your betters."  The leader glared at Fineous, daring him to do something.
<br><br>
Fineous growled, drew his sword, and lunged at the leader.  The leader quickly drew his sword and stepped back, parrying the attack, then the duel commenced.  The two fenced back and forth, Fineous obviously the better swordsman, as the leader slowly stepped back, forced to retreat.  
<br><br>
Unfortunately, Fineous did not take into account that muggers rarely play fair.  One of the other swordsmen stepped up beside the dueling pair and as Sandall shouted a warning the swordsmen shoved his sword into Fineous' side.  Fineous went down hard, red blood staining the sandy floor of the building as the muggers turned their attention to Sandall.
<br><br>
Sandall was outraged.  Seeing the kind young man that had shown them the sites of Freeport lying dead on the ground infuriated him, but he held no illusions of his chances against the muggers.  Reluctantly, he pulled out his purse and tossed it to the leader, who deftly caught it.  At least he still had most of his money back in his bags in the Inn, he thought to himself.
<br><br>
"The rings too, m'lord," the leader smiled, showing missing teeth.
<br><br>
Sandall pulled his rings and earrings off and handed them to the other swordsmen while the two with Kimera took off her jewelry.  Then they pushed her towards Sandall, who caught her and held her protectively.
<br><br>
"To show that we're not truly evil men," the leader said, glancing at the unmoving Fineous and chuckling, "we're going to let you go.  Normally, we like to leave no witnesses as well as have a bit of the rough-and-tumble with the lady, but I'm feeling generous.  However, you squeal to the militia and we WILL find you and gut you like a fish."  For emphasis, he kicked Fineous' body, though it did not move in response.
<br><br>
One of the swordsmen walked over and opened the door, bowing and indicating the couple should leave.  Sandall tentatively walked towards the door, holding his wife close and glancing about, trying to watch all the rogues.  Once outside, they hurried down the street the direction they came, headed back towards where Fineous had shown them their Inn was.
<br><br>
The swordsmen closed the door, then turned  to the room and smiled.  After a couple of moments, a muffled groan came from the floor.  "Did you have to kick me, Calious?"  Fineous slowly rose to his feet, wiping his juice-covered hands on a rag the leader tossed to him.  As he stood, he favoured his side a bit, rubbing his ribs where he was kicked.
<br><br>
Calious laughed out loud.  "It was for effect, boyo.  Good job on them, I must say.  As long as they don't run to the Paladins, we're set."
<br><br>
Fineous smiled and shook his head.  "No chance of that, I can assure you."
<br><br>
The larger man's eyebrows raised in surprise.  "You got them with the Paladin's Gambit, too?  Damn, boy, you're becoming quite the hustler.  We need to get out of here all the same."
<br><br>
The group hurried out a back entrance, down to the docks, over the edge, and into the warehouse that served as the entrance to the Thieves' Den.  Behind a secret door and down a tunnel, they met up with the rogue that was sent to the Coopersmith's rooms.  Fineous whistled in surprise when he was handed his share of the loot… almost 20 plat for an afternoon's work.
<br><br>
"Does this include the militia's cut?"  Fineous counted out the gold again, loving the sound and colour of it in the flickering torchlight.
<br><br>
"Yup.  You snagged us a big one this time.  Let's toast to our success."  Calious turned and pulled down some mugs from atop a keg and started pouring ale into them and handing them out.  Once everyone had a mug in hand, he stood and raised his own.  "To Fineous, the greatest lure in all the land!"
<br><br>
The other rogues laughed loudly and repeated the cheer, making Fineous smile broadly.  They all took a big swig of the bitter brew, then Fineous raised his mug.  "To Freeport, the greatest city in all the world!"
<br><br>
"Hear hear!" shouted the others and they drank some more, the celebration lasting well into the night, their laughter ringing down the halls of the sewers of Freeport.
