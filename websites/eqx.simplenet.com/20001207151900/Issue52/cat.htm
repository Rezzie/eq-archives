	Ozat didn't like the woman, really.  She was very pretty, yes, and any man would certainly desire her attentions, but he was old, and a woman's attentions were the furthest thing from his mind.  He saw through pale milky skin and raven black tresses, past the pretty face and deep into the person that stood before him. And what he saw was... nothing.  Euphoria, they called her.  No known real name, no relatives,  no friends; no acquaintances at all as far as Ozat knew.  Which was probably the main reason he didn't like the woman.  Information was his business, and when it came to Euphoria quite simply there was none.  Ozat didn't like being in the dark, and rarely was.  Yet here she stood; known by all who lived on the darker side of virtue, yet not truly known by any living being.
<br><br>
	Early attempts at conversation had long since been abandoned.   <em>Another annoyance to add to the list</em>, he thought bitterly.  Ozat's entire existence relied on his powers of observation and knowledge gained through that observation.  He had had decades to perfect his interrogation skills, and could scribe a detailed report of any man from scant minutes of small talk.  His was the art of subtlety; people reveal themselves a thousand times over without realization , and he was a master of absorbing those revelations, combining and nurturing them until he had what he wanted.  Foiled again, he was.  Such a closed book he had never seen as this pale shadow presented, <em>yet a reputation the size of an Erudite's ego</em>, he grimaced to himself.  
<br><br>
	Yet she came highly recommended, and he needed this errand done with absolutely no mistakes.  With her all black attire emphasizing her pale face, she stood as a shadow awaiting his next words.  From what Ozat <em>could</em> deduce she seemed to be quite young, something that bothered him yet again about her, but reliable sources confirmed her skill and abilities.  A black riding cloak, hooded, hung limp from her shoulders and a loose , long sleeved blouse was tucked into snug black leather breeches.  Her feet and legs were covered by tall thigh boots, dripping mud from the street onto his floor.   All appeared to be well-tailored, though travel worn, and the black bandanna around her head revealed ears adorned with black pearl earrings.  <em>Not wealthy then, but certainly not a pauper</em>.
<br><br>
	Business brought him back to attention, and he spoke slowly in his conclusion.
<br><br>
	"Any questions, my dear?" He uttered.
<br><br>
	"No". Quick, clipped, revealing nothing.
<br><br>
	"Very well.  I shall be here several more days at most, if you have not returned by then, you know how to reach me."  He stood in dismissal and nodded good-bye.  "Good luck, my dear.  No mistakes and we are both happy."
<br><br>
	"Luck has nothing to do with it and I never make mistakes, milord"  With a nod and a sharp turn she was back out the door into the night, quickly disappearing into the rain.
<br><br>
	Ozat sat and turned towards the hearth, feeling no heat from its blaze.  He neither liked nor trusted that woman, but she was his last hope; nay, she was Norrath's last hope.  <em>The fate of a kingdom lying on the shoulders of an old man and a woman to  whom it has never been kind</em>, he mused.
<br><br>
	Ozat chuckled into the fire, drifting into a restless slumber as the rain continued to fall.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Jez'al Alaria stepped out into the drizzle and let the door <em>snick</em> shut behind her.  She looked up for a moment and let the warm drops wash the chiseled guise of discipline off of her face before pulling up her hood and breaking into a quick walk.   <em>Euphoria will be proud</em>, she thought as she made her way through the winding streets of Freeport.  <em>Ozat</em> himself <em>had thought I was Euphoria</em>, she grinned to herself.  <em>Yes, the Old Lady will be quiet pleased at my progress</em>.  Her grin widened.
<br><br>
	Of her students, Jez'al knew she was Euphoria's best.  She reminded Euphoria of herself, "..in days past..." she had said, though Jez'al was a bit more 'improvisational' than her mentor would like.  <em>Or mischievous, as she would put it</em>.  Euphoria thought she lacked discipline, though that was utter rubbish, as Jez'al had just proven.  Feeling quite full of herself she gave a short laugh as the last of the rain turned to a fine mist and finally disappeared.   A dark blue sky revealed itself as she neared the outer wall... five minutes and she would be out of the city, on her way 'home' as it was.
<br><br>
	It was dumb luck that she stumbled on an unseen stone, for the blow which would have otherwise struck her full in the head only caught her shoulder as she twisted.   Years of training took over her body and using the momentum of the turn, her dagger found itself hilt deep between the ribs of her assailant.  A quick turn of the wrist and the tall figure gasped a gurgley breath that smelled of rotting sewage and fell to the ground in a heap of grey robes.  The long curved blade the stranger had been holding clattered to the paving stones as Jez'al ducked into a back alley and instantly disappeared into it's shadowy refuge.  She caught here breath and listened for what seemed like ages.  Nothing.  As her heart slowed, she crept back to the alley entrance to get a better look at the street.  A glance north showed her what she wanted to see... the northern wall jutted up into the night sky, almost hiding the treetops on the other side.  A quick dash and she would be free.  However, as she looked back in the direction she had come she froze again.  Stomach turning to ice she blinked and stared.  Where the body had fallen there was nothing.  She had had been in the alley for only a few seconds, and had heard absolutely nothing.
<br><br>
     The fear of a caged beast overrode all other instincts and she bolted for the north wall.  As she rounded the last corner Jez'al skidded to a halt on the still wet cobblestone.   There was her escape, a rope dangling halfway down the wall above the street lamp just as she had left it.  What was not as she had left it was a tall figure in a long blue sleeved shirt and brown breeches lounging against the wall itself.  Jez'al quickly dismissed the person as simply a chance passerby, as no one wandered the streets of Freeport this late, in this part of town especially.   She was instantly proven right as the man, no, an elf she could see now, gave a low whistle and drew a long, slender sword from his side.  A nightingale whistle she thought.   From behind her she heard an answering whistle.  Then from the roof.  Then from the top of the wall. Pulling her dagger again from her belt, Jez'al gritted her teeth and started forward, toward her only visible target.
<br><br>
	Before she got halfway down the alleyway, a small shadow plummeted from a rooftop, landing on Jez'al and knocking her to the ground, her head making a dull <em>thump</em> as it hit solid stone.  With silver flashes in her eyes, she blindly rolled backwards into a crouch position, a long silver dirk appearing in her hand.  She permitted herself to relax slightly as she saw the dagger which had been in her other hand sticking through the neck of the halfling lying a few feet away; her reflexes had struck true.  Before she could congratulate herself, a flash of bright metal materialized into a small thin blade quivering in the wall inches from where her head had just been.   Another flash came hurtling out of the night, and realizing she had no time to avoid it, Jez'al turned and took the hit in her already injured shoulder which suddenly blazed with a fiery new pain.  <em>I pray to whichever gods are listening that it isn't a poisoned blade....</em> she thought grimly.  She dove into another small service alleyway, tumbling over piles of refuse that littered the narrow passage.   Another small blade hit the stones where she had been with a loud clang and a small shower of sparks.  Getting to her feet, Jez'al stumble-ran her way down the near pitch black alley,  tall buildings on either side blocking the moonlight.  No more than a few steps into her flight, Jez'al came up short as a tall, cruel wall marked the end of the alley.  She painfully straightened her shoulders, took a deep breath and turned back the way she had come, her eyes that of  a beast which knew it was dead.  <em>Someone else will die first</em>, was her only battle plan.  Her blades gleamed in the darkness as she forced her feet forward.
<br><br>
	She reached the exit just as a small burly dwarf rounded the corner at a trot, a small knife in each hand.  The kick she landed on his ugly face sent the smelly creature flying several feet back into the main alley.  A heartbeat later, Jez'al was on top of him, long blade finding a home in an eye socket as the dwarf drunkenly tried to regain his feet.  He collapsed again with a dwarfish scream, but Jez'al was already turning toward the wall where the elf still stood, now holding a short sword in each hand.  <em>So be it</em>, she thought as she continued forward, one arm numb at her side.  <em>Nothing to lose but my life</em>.
<br><br>
	Just as Jez'al was about to pounce, a figure emerged from the wall, seeming to melt away from the grey surface.
<br><br>
     "HALT!" a strong voice pierced the night air.  The command halted Jez'al in her tracks, and the elf whirled, wicked grin gone as he was caught off guard.  "And you, your work is done. I have no further need of your service at this time", this directed at the elf.
<br><br>
     He caught a large leather purse that was flung from the shadowy figure, hefted it several times, and glanced at his two fallen conspirators.   With a slight motion to the shadows, he turned and disappeared around the corner.  Several shadows Jez'al had not noticed suddenly moved to follow.  There were four of them, another elf and three more halflings.  One of the halflings gave her a mocking bow and salute before disappearing along with the rest.
<br><br>
    "You failed." was all Euphoria uttered from the back of her voluminous hood.  When Jez'al could not reply with anything but a gaping mouth, Euphoria continued.  "I could have killed you four times tonight, and you didn't even know it.  Pathetic.  It is clear nothing I have taught you has been learned.  Now come, we shant discuss this here.  We have much work to do in order to carry out Ozat's request, reprimands will have to be handled later." she finished.
<br><br>
    Jez'al queried in an unsteady voice, "B... but milady, who <em>were</em> those people?  And how did you know of Ozat, I have not told you what he wished.....".
<br><br>
    "I paid them to kill you, and I was present at your little meeting"  she said in an offhand manner.  With that Euphoria turned sharply and, quicker than Jez'al would have expected, was up the lamppost and atop the wall.   Dumbstruck and confused she painfully followed her mentor up the wall, somehow making her arm work and pulling the rope up after her... she indeed had much more to learn from her old tutor... much more indeed.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	<em>Gods damn Karana and his light-blasted storm</em>,  Euphoria grimaced as she massaged her hands together.  <em>The old bastard knows my joints don't like his miserable downpours</em>.  Her grimace suddenly turned to an audible chuckle as she heard her words.  <em>The gods damning the Rainkeeper on MY behalf, now there's a laugh</em>!  She quickly regained her composure, but a quick glance through the moonlight at the half-frightened, half-confused look on her pupil's face brought her laughter back full force.  <em>Oh! She thinks this old girl has finally lost it</em>!  She snorted and smiled at Jez'al in a comforting manner.  
<br><br>
	"Okay, enough of this.  I have stood before courts, lied to Kings, relieved more men of their worthless lives than I can count and still can't stay mad at you for more than a few miles walk!" she chuckled.  "You are alive, but that doesn't mean you're off the hook!  You should have been more careful back there," she chided.   "Now let me take care of that arm."
<br><br>
	A glance at the withdrawn face walking beside her caused something that rarely happened.
<br><br>
	"That dwarf you killed was one of the most renowned assassins in Freeport.  I told him to be cautious.  In that at least you succeeded," she offered grudgingly as she tended the wound.  Seeing the beginnings of a pitiful smile, she continued.  "And you <em>did</em> have old Ozat squirming in his wrinkled old skin.  I've not seen him as flustered for decades," she chuckled once more.  Jez'al finally grinned outright at the rare compliment from her mentor.
<br><br>
	"He was a bit put out wasn't he?" the young black clad girl stated with a gleam in her eye.  "Even to this day, you still amaze me, Old Mother.  Where were you lurking about?  The rafters?"  Jez'al quickly answered her own question, "No, I looked up there when I entered...," she finished in a mutter.
<br><br>
	Euphoria let her ponder the question for a few moments as she finished wrapping Jez'al's wounded shoulder.  "Look at me, young one, " she instructed.  "Observation is the only weapon we can ever count on in the lives we have chosen to live.  Look at me, and answer your own question, " she finished.
<br><br>
	Jez'al habitually brought her thumb to her mouth and bit on it in thought as she looked at the old woman.
<br><br>
	"That gesture would have just gotten you killed in Halas, oh young one of many habits, " Euphoria tsked as she turned into the moonlight for inspection.  "Now stop insulting me and answer your question."
<br><br>
	Jez'al quickly removed her hand from her mouth and looked for one more moment before her face lit up in affirmation as she noticed the soot on her teachers face.
<br><br>
	"The fireplace!  How on <em>Norrath</em> did you get out of there and back to the wall before me?  Not to mention how did you get <em>in</em> there... Ozat had at least two new logs ablaze..."  she finished with a puzzled look.
<br><br>
	Euphoria nodded curtly and resumed walking, offering no explanation.  "I am surprised you didn't smell the smoke on me before now, you <em>really</em> must learn to use all of your senses, Jez."  Noticing Jez'al glance back toward the city, the old woman added, "Don't worry about them, I paid them enough to keep an Ogre fed for a year. By now they're either half naked in a brothel somewhere, or half drunk.  Most likely both," she snorted.  "And quit looking at me like that.  I knew you could handle yourself.  The dwarf and the elf were the only worthy hires I could find in this entire city, and neither of them had my training."
<br><br>
	"And the halflings? ," Jez'al asked accusingly.  "I've never know a halfling to fancy assassination."
<br><br>
	Euphoria waved in a dismissing gesture.  "Those rugrats were just some barroom scum who knew the dwarf.  They needed the gold."
<br><br>
	Jez'al paused briefly and offered one more accusing question.  "What about the other fellow?  The tall back-stabbing fellow in the grey robes with the bad breath.  Now he was a frightful sight, though I never got a look at his face.  He just disappeared ...He isn't still on my trail is...."  Jez'al cut short in a gasp as Euphoria whirled around and caught her injured shoulder in a steel grip.
<br><br>
	"What did you say? Did you kill it? How did you kill it?  It's a wonder you are still alive...", she asked with a ferocity she rarely displayed.
<br><br>
	"Y...yes...I..I think so...ow!"  she yelped as Euphoria shook her 
<br><br>
	"<em>Think</em> or <em>did</em>?  Did you see it's corpse? Did it touch you in any way?  Did it cut you? <em>Quickly child</em>!".  Euphoria knew she sounded frantic, but time was of the essence.
<br><br>
	"<em>Yes! Yes! No!</em> wait... slow down... <em>slow down and let go of me!</em>"  Jez'al tried to shove the old woman, but found only empty air where Euphoria had been.  The youngster was quick, but the old assassin was quicker.  Jez'al caught her balance and gripped her now throbbing shoulder.  "<em>What's gotten into you!</em>, " she cried.
<br><br>
	As Euphoria opened her mouth to respond, something made her stop.  She cocked her head to the side to listen.  "Something is wrong here child, I fear your revelation has come too late.  You must get back home.  Move now!  Back to the cottage!"
<br><br>
	Crickets stopped mid chirp and a hush fell over the forest.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Jez'al opened her mouth to respond, but her words died as Euphoria's had at the sudden silence.    She gave a puzzled glance to Euphoria and was shocked at what she saw on her face.  Fear.  She had never seen Euphoria afraid in her life.  
<br><br>
	"Can you run, child?"  the old woman asked in a whisper, continuing to stare back down the path they had come.
<br><br>
	"Yes ma'am, I think I can, only why...."  Jez'al was interrupted yet again.
<br><br>
	"<em>Silence and listen</em>!  Get back to the cottage as quickly as you can.  Tell Lyza to put up as many wards as she can, do you understand?"  the elder assassin asked.
<br><br>
	"Why do we need a cleric's wards?  What's going on? Where are you going?"  Jez'al was confused.
<br><br>
	"<em>Please</em> Jez! I haven't time to explain!  Just tell her..." Euphoria fell quiet as a branch snapped somewhere in the shadows.
<br><br>
	Jez'al had no idea what was happening, until she followed her mentor's gaze into the trees.  Between two mammoth pine trees, the shadows were moving together, wind dying down as the darkness gathered, seeming to deepen and twist in a manner the eye couldn't follow.  When the shadows parted, they left the form of a robed man standing in their wake.  He seemed unnaturally tall, and in the moonlight, Jez'al could see a large slash in the grey robes.  A large slash in the chest.  A large slash she had administered with her blade not one hour past.  A large slash with no blood.   The hooded figure, easily seven feet tall, began to move silently forward.  Beside her, Euphoria drew her dagger.
<br><br>
	"If you have never done anything I have told you, if you have never listened to a word I have said, listen now.  You must get to Lyza, and you must do it now."  The old woman never turned her gaze from the advancing figure.
<br><br>
	Jez'al interjected, "You are staying to fight, I am staying to fight.  I fought it before..."
<br><br>
	"<em>You were LUCKY before!  For the love of the Seven Moons child, do as I say.... you have no idea the seriousness of this situation.  RUN</em>!" she cried.  The resistance in Jez'al's eyes disappeared as Euphoria punched her in the face, sending her to her backside.  "RUN!", she screamed down on Jez'al before turning back to the grey figure.
<br><br>
	Jez'al gathered her feet, turned, and fled.  The old woman was yelling at the figure, cursing at it in old Erudin, but other than the expletives, Jez'al only knew one other word.  <em>Mord'an</em>.  If she could only remember... Jez'al ran.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	A cry of pure terror shattered the forest.  The running figure of the assassin known as Jez'al stumbled and fell forward onto her knees.  The cry had been her own.  She had remembered.  In the darkness on her knees,  she wept for the only person she had ever loved as she remembered.  <em>Mord'an</em>.  The Shadow Man.  Euphoria had gone to battle with a Liche.
