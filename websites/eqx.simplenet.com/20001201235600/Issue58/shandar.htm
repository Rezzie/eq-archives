Shandar had been in the tavern several times since his last visit.  This time was different, however.  He came not to celebrate, or even to enjoy his drink.  Today he came to drown his sorrows.  He was trying to forget the man he once was, and trying to convince himself that he truly had changed since that day.
<br><br>
So, he sat at the table, quite drunk, nursing his ale and remembering times long past.  "Annudder drink pleazhe!" he yelled.  
<br><br>
He was close to actually passing out, but still he needed more.  <em>Just one more</em>, he thought. <em>Then I can forget</em>.  He had been a different man before; he had done some questionable things in his past.  Three years ago that changed; he became a different man.  No amount of ale could ever erase his past, but every year for three long years he traveled to the local tavern to remind himself why he changed. Others had forgiven him, but he could never forgive himself.  So, he sat there drinking, slowly moving towards unconsciousness as his mind wandered back to the events that led up to that night.
	<br><br>
Shandar was born in Kelethin, and not surprisingly that is where he met his best friend, the woodland elf,  Kyllian. A half-elf orphaned at a young age, Shandar became a common thief, and one day he noticed Kyllian, an easy target, or so he thought.  Slowly he crept up trying not to attract any attention, then he cautiously reached towards Kyllian's purse.
<br><br>
"Get your hands off my purse you thief!" shouted Kyllian.
<br><br>
"What? But... but I was just hungry.  I have no money, and I…" sputtered Shandar.
<br><br>
"You thought you would relieve me of mine!?  I think not!  If it is food you want, then take this," said Kyllian handing the young pickpocket a loaf of bread.  "I am not rich, but I will not refuse a starving man some food.  Next time, perhaps you should ask; you'd be surprised at the generosity of strangers."
<br><br>
And from that simple act a friendship was born.  The two young men began traveling and drinking together, and over time Shandar became a member of Kyllian's family.  The family was not rich, but they shared all that they had with Shandar.  The boys began to grow into fine men, and each fostered dreams of greatness.  
<br><br>
Shandar wanted to be a rogue, but in truth he didn't have the skill for it.  He was very charismatic, however, and his voice was so great that he could sing songs that would bring tears to the eyes of an ogre; so, Shandar decided that he would become a bard.  Kyllian was an altogether different story, however.  Whatever he did, he did well, and he wanted to become a ranger.  So, it was that Kyllian grew up to become a fine young ranger, which was fine with Shandar. He thought stories of a woodland warrior and his half-elf companion would be perfect for the future generations of Norrath to remember.
<br><br>
The two men had traveled together on a few short adventures, and Shandar dreamed of the day that songs of their adventures would one day be heard throughout all of Norrath.  Then one day Kyllian shattered all of Shandar's dreams with a simple announcement.
<br><br>
"I'm afraid I can't go with you today Shandar," said the wood elf.
<br><br>
"But Kyllian why?  We had this journey planned for weeks," replied Shandar.
<br><br>
"Well," he said, "I met this girl.  Her name is Shalla, and she is certainly the most beautiful thing in all of Nature.  She has invited me to a celebration, and I simply could not refuse.  Perhaps we can go tomorrow."
<br><br>
"Oh, all right," replied the young bard, "tomorrow it is."
<br><br>
But they did not go the next day, or the day after that.  Then, the days dragged into weeks and Shandar began to worry that their adventuring days were over.  Although Shandar knew he should be happy for Kyllian, he could not.  He grew jealous.  This woman had come in and taken away the closest thing to family that he had ever known.  So, one day Shandar went to see a seer who claimed to be able to see the future.  He told the prophet of his problems, and the seer listened.  Cloaked in black, the figure told him of his future.
<br><br>
"You are doomed," said the seer in an old and scratchy voice.  "Soon you will betray your friend in an attempt to save him.  He will forgive you, but your treachery will be forever remembered.  The dark gods will smile on your deed and you will be cursed to wander the earth in penance.  Mortals and gods forgive, but your conscience never will."
<br><br>
Shandar simply dismissed the seer.  He spoke in riddles and knew nothing, for if he did, he would know that Shandar would never betray his best friend.
<br><br>
Weeks passed, and the events continued to unfold.  Then one day, Kyllian came with the news that Shandar had dreaded.
<br><br>
"I plan to settle down my friend.  Shalla does not wish me to leave, and I wish only to be with Shalla.  I wish you luck in your journeys, but I can no longer adventure with you.  Shalla and I are to be married in a fortnight," said Kyllian.
<br><br>
Concerned that he would lose his best friend, Shandar replied, "But Kyllian, we are friends.  What of the grand adventures that we planned as boys?  Will we not one day conquer the dungeon Befallen?  And what about protecting the nature that you so love?"
<br><br>
"We will always be friends, Shandar.  Feel free to visit me anytime.  You can still adventure, and as for nature there are plenty of rangers and druids out there to protect the forests.  There is only one man who shall be Shalla's husband, however, and that man will be me."  And with that, the discussion was ended.
<br><br>
Shandar could not understand.  He had never actually been in love before.  He had had many women, but he had never been in love.  He was not finished, though.  He had a plan; he would make sure that his dreams of glory and adventure did not die.  So, one night about a week before the wedding he made an appointment with some old acquaintances.  He explained his situation to them, and they began laughing.
<br><br>
"So this is all about losin' a friend is it?  It's nae the gal yuir wantin'?" one of them asked.
<br><br>
Embarrassed that these buffoons didn't understand that she was ruining years of dreams, Shandar made up an excuse, "That's right you moron.  I've worked years preparing him to be my personal guard.  His skill is enough to take all of you out with ease.  He simply needs some experience to hone his skills.  Now I won't let her ruin this; I've spent too long getting him prepared."
<br><br>
"Yeah, right," replied another, "anyways, if de money's good we'll do whatever ye want."
<br><br>
Shandar pulled out a small pouch full of coins that he had collected over the years.  "Here," he said.  "Now understand the girl is <em>not</em> to be harmed, merely scared.  Tell her that Kyllian killed your father, and you won't rest until he's slain or something.  Be creative.  She'll get scared and call off the wedding.  Problem solved; then you will receive the other half of your payment."
<br><br>
"No problem," said the leader with a leering grin.
<br><br>
So it was that two weeks later Shandar threw a bachelor party for Kyllian.  And that night as Shalla retired to bed the thieves broke in.
<br><br>
"Hey wench!  The weddings off!  Your friend Kyllian owes us some money, and this 'ere wedding ain't gonna 'appen until we get paid," shouted one of them.
<br><br>
The three elves swarmed around her, and although Shalla was scared, she was not defenseless.  She pulled out a dagger and sliced the leader across the arm.  This only made him angry, however.  The three men eyed her like a piece of meat and attacked.
<br><br>
Her screams could be heard throughout most of Kelethin.  At the tavern, the party was just beginning when they heard the screams.  Quickly Kyllian hurried out the door followed by Shandar and several others.  The adrenaline began pumping through their veins, and the effects of various liquors quickly wore off. 
<br><br>
The men followed the noise and came closer and closer to Shalla's house, and the closer they got the sicker Shandar felt.  He had just now realized what he had done.  Looking at Shandar's face, he realized for the first time what Shalla meant to him and what true love was.  By the gods, if they had hurt her, Shandar would make them pay.
<br><br>
Two city guards began to beat two of the attackers into submission.  The other one, the leader, ran.  Kyllian ignored them and ran straight into Shalla's home.  Shandar saw the leader and set off in hot pursuit.
<br><br>
<em>No!</em> he thought <em>You will not get away!  No songs today for your death will not be pretty.</em>
<br><br>
Slowly Shandar gained on the man until finally he tackled him at the very edge of Kelethin.  "I told you she was not to be harmed!!  Only scared, What have you done?"
<br><br>
"Aye she was scared all right.  Besides, you got what you wanted.  You can be very sure there ain't gonna be no wedding.  Now let go, and don't be so righteous.  Acting like you're any better than me.  You're just as bad as me... no worse.  I ain't never stabbed my friends in de back!  You're sleaze just like the rest of us.  Now let me go." said the leader.
<br><br>
The words hit Shandar, and he couldn't deny that what he did was wrong, but this man wouldn't get away.  "Go," said Shandar, "run!"  And as the man turned he received a gentle shove and tumbled down, out of Kelethin, hitting the ground with a dull thud.
<br><br>
The guards arrived just in time to see the leader hit the ground.
<br><br>
"Good job," said one of them.
<br><br>
"Yeah," said the other.
<br><br>
But Shandar was no longer listening.  He had already began sprinting back to Shalla's to check on his friend.  When he entered the house, he couldn't help but be sick.  Her parents lay murdered in the front room.  He made his way back further and found Kyllian cradling Shalla's lifeless body in his arms.  The room was a mess and Kyllian was sobbing hysterically.  In all the time Shandar had known Kyllian, he had never seen him cry.  Kyllian was hard to upset, but the loss of Shalla opened a fountain of tears.
<br><br>
The funeral was set for two days later, but Shandar was afraid.  If he told Kyllian, he might lose his best friend, but if he didn't, he was afraid he couldn't live with himself.  Finally, he decided Kyllian's approval was more important than his own, so he would keep this to himself.
<br><br>
Then on the night before the funeral he sat in an alley thinking.  Out of the shadows stepped a dark figure.  It was the seer.  
<br><br>
"Damn it! You were right.  Why did you have to speak in riddles?  Why couldn't you just tell me what to do?"
<br><br>
"Riddles is what I do.  What fun would it be to just tell you what to do?" replied the seer in a deep and scratchy voice.  The voice sounded much like before only this time it resonated with power.
<br><br>
"Who... Who are you?" asked Shandar.
<br><br>
"Ah, you fool, don't you see?  Now I have a chance at your soul, that most precious of commodities.  If you tell Kyllian, you will be damned and lose all you ever cared for.  If you don't, however, your soul will belong to the dark gods and they will be appeased.  You have a choice to make.  Now, who do you think I am?" replied the seer.
<br><br>
And in that instant Shandar's entire outlook on life changed.  "You're right," he said, "I do have a choice to make, but not the one you want," said Shandar.  Then he ran off in search of Kyllian.
<br><br>
But the seer remained and spoke once again.  Slowly the voice changed from deep and scratchy to a calm and beautiful voice as soothing as a spring breeze.  "Ah, don't be so sure, young mortal.  The gods are tricky things, and I am sure that you have made the right choice.  Now, go find redemption, and tell the mortals that the gods walk among you still, whether you see them or not."  Then the seer simply disappeared, as if blown away in the wind.
<br><br>
Later that night Shandar confronted Kyllian.
<br><br>
"Gods forgive me!" cried Shandar. "It's all my fault!" He tried to explain, but no explanation would do.
<br><br>
"What!?" exclaimed Kyllian in disbelief.  "How could you?  We are friends are we not?  How could you do this?  You know the worst thing Shandar?  Shalla really liked you.  She had even agreed to let us go adventuring together from time to time.  And you... you do this!?"
<br><br>
"I'm sorry Kyllian.  Please forgive me.  I didn't know.  I didn't mean for this to happen.  I really didn't." Shandar pleaded and tried to make Kyllian understand, but it was impossible.  Shandar wasn't even sure that he understood anymore.
<br><br>
"I can forgive you Shandar because we have always been like brothers, but I can never forget. this act of yours has cost me my true love and now my best friend.  Go, I never want to see you again."
<br><br>
And on that night,  Shandar's life was forever changed.  He made a set of vows to live by and became not only a wandering bard but a decent man.  And for the past three years he had wandered the land helping others and seeking redemption for his past crimes.  No longer did he care just for Shandar.  Now others were often his primary concern.
<br><br>
Shandar lay at the table passed out.  The barkeep approached and saw a small slip of paper.  On it was written:
<br><br>
<em>Shandar's Vows
<ol>
	<li>Respect the gods
	<li>Respect others
	<li>Know humility
	<li>Help the unfortunate
	<li>Keep your friends for they are the most valuable possession of all
</ol>
</em>

The barkeep gently stuffed the piece of paper back into Shandar's shirt pocket, and then he woke him up.  "Ye've had enough to drink young one.  Ye best be gettin' home now."
<br><br>
"Aye, good sir," replied Shandar.  "Here ye go. I best be goin' now."
<br><br>
"But laddie, this is too much."
<br><br>
"Keep it.  I've got more important things to worry about tonight," and with that Shandar stumbled out of the tavern singing a sad, sad song.
