   Jim looked over his shoulder to see his wife running up the stairs.  They had both had a hard day at work and needed to let off some frustration.  
<br><br>
"Hey wait up" she said was she climbed the last stair to reach him.   "You know I can't run that fast."
<br><br>
Jim laughed.
<br><br>
Together they raced inside and fired up their computers.  Jim was the first to load the game.  Beth soon had hers loaded as well.
<br><br>
"I have to sell this equipment and I'll come and join you after I sell in Freeport."  Jim said as he focused his attention to the monitor.
<br><br>
Beth loaded her character.  She noticed she had left her character in a "not so safe" area when she logged off.  She knew Jim had told her a million times to make sure she was in a safe area before leaving the game, but she was tired last night when she finally logged off at two in the morning.  "Damn!  They are all over me!"  She said as the giant skeletons began to lash at her with their swords.
<br><br>
"I told you not to log there!  Damn Beth!" Jim scolded her.  He knew that if she were to die down there it was going to be impossible to get her out. 
<br><br>
Beth's Elf character ran as fast as her little legs could carry her.  She had been playing for weeks now and finally got her Elf to level fifteen.  She was very proud of her character.   It had been hard just learning the game, let alone staying alive.  
<br><br>
Jim had been playing for much longer than Beth.  His barbarian warrior was now level thirty-two.  He was just as proud of his character as Beth.   "You need to make it to the zone.  I'll start heading that way."  He said.  He changed his course and headed towards his wife's elf.   He knew he could never make it in time.  
<br><br>
Beth continued to where she thought the zone border was.  "Damn it was so late last night.  I have no idea where we came in." Her voice started to tremble.  The skeletons continued to pursue her, and as she ran she picked up more aggressors.  
<br><br>
"Nooooo" Beth said as her health bar turned purple...  She was knocked unconscious.  " Oh no!" she screamed as the angry mob applied the final blow.   Her elf was dead.  She sat there in silence as the "waiting to load" screen appeared on her screen.
<br><br>
Jim decided it was best just to keep quiet and continue his journey to her location, where he would no doubt need a lot of luck to find her corpse.  Neither of them had any idea where her elf had died.  
<br><br>
He reached the entrance of the dungeon where Beth had been killed.  He entered.  Once inside he did a quick scan to see who else was in the zone.  He was alone.  
<br><br>
"Damn" he mumbled to himself.
<br><br>
"What?" Beth glared at him and then looked back at her screen.  She was now back in Freeport where Jim had just been.  She headed started her journey back.
<br><br>
"Nothing" Jim said, not wanting her to get more upset.  He headed down into the depths of the dungeon.  Immediately he his attacked by several baddies.
<br><br>
"Damn" he repeated. Just then the door opened.   
<br><br>
Jim looked up to see his oldest son Ian entering the house.  "Quick I need your help, get your cleric over here now!"
<br><br>
"I'm going over to Jenny's house." He complained.
<br><br>
"Oh no, you're not, mister, you get him on now!  Your mother needs us!"  Jim snarled.  Ian mumbled as he loaded the game on his computer.
<br><br>
Jim headed back out of the dungeon before he met the same fate as Beth.  He would wait until Ian got his cleric there to help him.  
<br><br>
Once Ian arrived with his character they grouped and headed back into the dungeon.  Beth joined them just as they entered.  "You wait here.  I don't need you dying again.  This won't take long."  Jim hoped.
<br><br>
Ian followed close to Jim's warrior as they continued into the depths of the dungeon.  He continued to protest.  " I better not die!  I'm not stupid enough to die down here, why should I have help get her out?"
<br><br>
"Just be quiet and follow me!"  Jim answered.  
<br><br>
As they continued forward they were attacked.  Jim's barbarian is immediately surrounded.   Ian began casting heal spells on Jim's character, just barely enough to keep him alive.  "This is stupid." Ian repeated.
<br><br>
After the battle Jim called Beth to his screen.  "Where were you?"
<br><br>
"Well I'm not sure.  I think down there," she said pointing to the left.
<br><br>
Jim headed down the corridor to the left where they are again attacked by thugs.  
<br><br>
Again they escaped death and continued the search.  
<br><br>
"Well maybe it was down there further." Beth said, pointing down a flight of stairs.  
<br><br>
Jim was getting worried.  He didn't want to get both him and Ian killed as well.  
<br><br>
"Beth I don't think we are going to be able to do this.  Its just to hard down there." Jim said cringing at what her response would be.
<br><br>
Just then someone yelled "Hey anyone lose a corpse down here?"  
<br><br>
Jim did a /who and to his surprise discovered they were not alone in the dungeon anymore.  This someone had found there Beth's corpse as well.  
<br><br>
"YES we are saved." Ian shouted. 
<br><br>
Beth sighed with relief.  
<br><br>
Jim and Ian headed towards the party.  After getting permission from Beth, Jim secured her equipment and headed out of the dungeon.  
<br><br>
They reached the exit to find Beth's naked elf standing there ready to greet them.  "I love you, honey." Beth said as she hugged and kissed Jim.
<br><br>
After exchanging hugs the family headed into the sunset, back to Freeport.
