(Okay, so we don't have Razor to kick around anymore.  Somebody needs to inject some real-life into our petty game squabbling.  Here goes!)
<br><br>
Urban legends, some call them.  They're modern stories of daring deed and, quite often, incredible stupidity.
<br><br>
Who does not quake in fear when being told the tale of the hooked killer who stalked lover's lane.  Who can deny the excess of the tales of use of Spanish Fly and powdered rhino horn.  Who does not cringe when they hear the story of Richard Gere's anus versus the Gerbil.

By the time he managed to get himself back up the ladder to the poop deck, the sailors were all finished with their ritual sacrifices.  They had all climbed back into their various positions among the rigging, where they could continue to watch the proceedings without overcrowding the poop deck.  Glind was already at the railing.

I can still see the look on my father's face when I told him where I'd been. The dried blood on my shirt and the dirt on my face were enough to convince my parents that their worst fears had been realized.
<br><br>
"You've made your choice," was all my father said upon hearing my story. "Don't expect us to like it." They turned away from me then, and I can still clearly see them walk away... My father's arm wrapped around my mother's shoulders, supporting her. That was the day of my first real battle, outside the practice room in the Defender's Hall. That was also the day I left home, and the last time I saw my parents.

Gorliss peeked around the massive cedar serving as his lookout post. Thirty yards away, High Elves had established a military field camp. The camp had become busy very quickly. Elven heavy infantry, mobile archer troops, and pikemen were assembling in the camp's central square, their military precision and orderly movement a thing of beauty and renown.

Orc rivers had been aggressively raiding the Greater Feydark, pillaging Wood Elf, High Elf, and human villages alike. The High Elves, a stoic and aloof race, normally left the safety of the Faydark, a massive, heavily forested area encircled by young, sharp mountains, to their wilder cousins the Wood Elves. The Wood Elves were savagely effective in their efforts against the orcs<b>...</b>

Hi Oghma,
<br><br>
Sorry this is a week late but I have been quite busy lately and just got around to reading the 100th Issue. Congrats to everyone at 
EQX on such an achievement. EverQuest would not be the game it is today without your constant support.
