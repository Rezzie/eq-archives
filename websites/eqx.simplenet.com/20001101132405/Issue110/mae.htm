	I was in bar in Rivervale when I learned that my beloved twin sister was dead. I was sitting across from a Halfling who thought he could beat me in poker when he invited another person to join our game. The young man sat down, and from the way his eyes never left the pile of platinum on the table, one could tell that he was a rogue. I cut the deck of cards once, and passed them across the table and set them down in front of him. "Your deal, kid," I said. And then he looked up at me for the first time. He turned as white as a High Elf with a decent tan. His hands went to his sides immediately, and he stood up on shaky legs, knocking his chair over in the process.
<br><br>
	"Is this some kind of a sick joke?" the lad said to his Halfling friend, never taking his eyes off me for a moment. The Halfling shrugged unknowingly, and gestured for the rogue to sit down. The rogue shook his head slowly. "I won't play with the dead," he whispered so that I could just barely hear it, and he turned to walk away.
<br><br>
	I put my feet up on the table and called out after him. "You'll find that I have a well worked pulse, boy, and that there's not a few men in this tavern who can attest to it." Laughter from around the room forced him to turn back and look at me again. Tremors ran through his whole body, making him look like a goblin in the middle of a Misty Thicket rainstorm. Even his voice shivered as he spoke once more.
<br><br>
	"I saw them kill you," he breathed. "They made me bury your body in the desert." I got up out of my chair and moved towards him, even as he backed away from me. "Leave me be ghost!" he shouted in a most panicked voice. "Your death is not on my hands! Seek out the others! You'll find them stained with blood."
<br><br>
	I reached out and with both hands pinned him to the tavern wall. My mind was racing. I had been in Rivervale for weeks now, since my sister Lini had left my company for the warmer climes of the Deserts of Ro. Could this be real? Or had Quellious' light left me and I was trapped in some kind of waking madness?
<br><br>
	"Tell me who you work for boy, and you may live the night," I said, trying to stay calm and clear headed. "I have a sister, a twin. Who sent you to kill her?" I pressed my arm up into his windpipe. "You <em>will</em> tell me now!"
<br><br>
	He began to stammer looking almost relieved that I was not my sister's ghost, but merely some mortal woman that was ready to pummel him to death. "I don't know his name, I was hired halfway through the trip… It wasn't meant to be an assassination, just a retrieval. But the girl, she wouldn't come back with us, she fought them, and the barbarian accidentally killed her."
<br><br>
	"Where was she to be taken?" I demanded, already knowing the answer even as the wretched man uttered it. "Freeport, the south side by the docks," he said. Father, I thought to myself, he's trying to reclaim his prodigal daughters and use us as bait again for business ventures. And he ended up killing Lini. Would he even mourn her death? How long until his henchmen came for me?
<br><br>
	I pondered asking for the names of the others that had had a hand in my sister's death, and then thought better of it. I knew where the real blame lay. Did Father really think us so weak as to just fall into the hands of those that would stand against us, and the life that we had chosen for ourselves? Quellious' light, that man was blinded by greed and pride. He would pay for it this time, no more forgiveness from the ties of blood. What little allegiance I had for him died on Lini's last breath and my father would now feel the wrath of his workings.
<br><br>
	I released my hold on the young rogue, and he started to move away from me. Anger and instinct took over then, and my foot flew off the ground and straight into his chin, knocking him to the ground without a sound. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my poker partner reaching for the pot of money on our table. I put my hands down in front of it, and leaned into the halfling's face. "All that and much more can be yours, if you can show me someplace to hold this rogue safely for the night." The little man smiled brightly at me, and nodded, without a word.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	After the little man had dragged the rogue away, I sat down and had a few drinks to calm my nerves. I desperately wanted to seek out my friends, and ask for their aid in this, but I knew that I needed to know what I wanted to do first. The last thing I wanted at that moment was to rush blindly into retribution. Lini deserved better. She deserved to be alive, but at least she had died free of our father, having known the peace of the light of the Child. It brought me little comfort to know that she was eternally in His light now, it brought me even less to know that she was buried nameless in the sands of Ro.
<br><br>
	I emptied the last of my gypsy wine, and moved out of the tavern. I would need some help in the first half of my task, and I knew just the bard to do it. Genneth was not far from Rivervale at the time, and bards are famous for finding corpses, as well as being speedy companions. I ran as fast as my feet could carry me into the maze of the Beholder to seek her out.
<br><br>
	I found her as one usually does singing to the sick and smiling at the handsome men. Her wedding was several months away at that time, so don't hold her enthusiasm for flirtation against her. She is a bard after all. She had never met my sister, but the sympathy that she expressed was genuine. She agreed to accompany me to Northern Ro to find my sister's body for a proper burial, and we decided to set off the following dawn.
<br><br>
	I did not sleep that night, rather I let my mind wander the roads of despair over my loss. These last few weeks had been the first time in my life that I had ever been separated from Lini. The thought of never seeing her again seemed improbable. Memories passed constantly in front of eyes that were unable to mourn the loss yet. No tears would come. I felt nothing but pure agonizing loneliness and anger. Visions of better days covered me for brief moments. Days spent practicing with Lini at the Ashen Order's guild house in Freeport during our youth, and of the guild masters laughing at us as we did. Shadow's dancing they called it when we fought. Master Puab even remarked once that the ultimate battle for a monk is with his own body and that we, as twins, were the perfect embodiment of that principle. You can never defeat yourself; nor can yourself defeat you so long as you have a perfect understanding of your enemy. And the only person that can allow you to be defeated in any fight, is yourself.
<br><br>
	We were too busy being pleased with our training as monks of Quellious then to realize just how long we'd been dancing with shadows. Or perhaps, how long we'd been letting the shadows lead. It wasn't until after my ill-fated day as a bride-to-be that we learned who our father really was. All we had known of him our whole lives was only a façade for the rest of the world to see. 
<br><br>
	I let my mind travel over the course of events that led up to this moment, trying to piece together how things had gone so wrong, trying to figure out what needed to be done to make it right.
<br><br>
	After my escape from my wedding, Lini met up with me at the guild house in Freeport. We gathered together what little possessions we had to call our own, and set off into the world. Mistress Reyia led us to the city walls to bid us farewell. She pulled us aside, and smiled weakly. "Girls, you are new to this world, and new to the Light of the Child. Try not to be blinded by the truth that He brings to you." 
<br><br>
	It wasn't long after that that we got the first inkling of what she meant.  While passing through West Commons, we were stopped by two militia guards. They entreated us to return home, saying that it was the best thing for "all of us" and that they would even escort us to our father's door. We refused, and they attempted to return us forcefully. It turned out that the daughters of Ruben Calloway had a price on their heads. Lini and I decided then that we had best move under the cover of night when we were less likely to be spotted.
<br><br>
	Soon enough, we found our way to Rivervale. And from numerous donations to the coffer's of the merchants' guild there, we discovered that our upwardly mobile, overprotective and overbearing father was himself a rogue. A powerful one at that - he controlled the resale of nearly all the stolen merchandise from the depths of Guk to the edges of Faydwer. Nothing on this side of Antonica was stolen without his permission nor sold without him getting part of the take. After taking all of this in, realizing who we were, and who we were up against, Lini wanted to move even farther eastward, and seek out our unknown relatives in Qeynos, but I said that I had run enough, and it was time to settle down. We agreed on a monthly price with the rogues of Rivervale, and for that tidy sum, they would keep our location secret.
<br><br>
	We were happy here. Soon enough though, Lini wanted to see more of the world. So she left with some friends to explore the deserts of Ro. She left me with smiles and embraces, and she promised to return before the first snowfall.
<br><br>
	I lay back on my bed in my rented room, waiting for the sun to rise. Time to dance with the shadows, I thought to myself. But this time, I planned on taking the lead.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Dawn finally came, and I woke up Genneth and brought her down to the cellar where the Halfling had been holding the rogue for me. A large purple bruise covered half of his face, nearly swelling one of his eyes shut. He was sleeping soundly even after we entered the room.
<br><br>
	Genneth smiled. "Did this one get too fresh with you, Maesyn dear? Or is that just what you monks like to call a 'love tap'?"
<br><br>
	I wasn't in the mood for any of Bristlebane's humor on this day however. "He's part of the group that was sent to fetch Lini. He's the one that buried her. We'll bring him with us to lead us to the general location, and then your song can do the rest of the work."
<br><br>
	"And what will you do with him then Mae?" she inquired.
<br><br>
	"Haven't thought that far ahead yet," I said.  "I'll let Quellious lead me to that light when He is ready." I reached down then and picked up a bucket of water that had been left for the man to drink and threw it on him to wake him up.
<br><br>
	The rogue shivered and sputtered as the water splashed him away from his dreams of greed. His eyes slid around the room, trying to assess his chances of escape. One door and two people that <em>weren't</em> tied up blocking it soon sent a sigh of capitulation through his battered body. "Come to finish me off now, lady?" he inquired meekly.
<br><br>
	"Actually," I said "I've come to let you lead us to my sister. It's an offer that you can't refuse, for as long as you are in our care, you live. If you choose to stay here, my Halfling friend will be more than happy to dispatch you for the money that I can offer him."
<br><br>
	The young man closed his eyes and shook his head. He had surrendered to his fate of leading us through the sands of Ro to Lini's corpse. I went over to him then and pulled him up to his feet with one arm. "You'll stay bound up till we get to Ro <em>friend</em>." I let the word slither off my tongue like an obscenity and added, "But if you try to escape, may all the good gods have mercy on your soul."
<br><br>
	Genneth opened the door, and I pushed the rogue out ahead of me, thus beginning the most painful trek of my young life.
<br><br>
	We had reached the tunnel between the Commonlands and the desert of Ro by sunset, and decided to camp within the cavern walls for the night. Rations were passed out, and after a day of traveling in silence, Genneth decided to become conversational with our unwilling guest. Soon enough, he was completely under her charm, and perhaps she was even under his a bit as well. The boy was exceptionally youthful, and I believed that he was much too naïve to have entered into my father's plot as a willing accomplice. He was just another orphan of Freeport looking to make a few coins for what must have seemed an easy job.
<br><br>
	I stared at him a long time from across the fire before finally speaking. "What's your name again boy?" I asked.
<br><br>
	"I'm called Rooksarii," he replied, purple half-elven eyes dancing in the firelight. "And I would like to say again that I am truly sorry for all of this. I meant no harm to anyone, and I backed away from the others as soon as it was apparent that the girl, your sister, was putting up a fight."
<br><br>
	I smirked slightly. "You'll be even more sorry if the likes of Ruben Calloway discover that you've been helping one of his errant children. Even if it is on a forced march."
<br><br>
	The boy blanched again. "You're Calloway's daughter?" he stumbled over his words, the full effect of what I had said sinking in. "And the other woman, your sister… Oh sweet Marr, call me home now and let it be done with!"
<br><br>
	Genneth stirred from the other side of the fire. "Will your father kill the boy for this Mae?" She seemed sincerely concerned about his welfare at this point, but I was in no mood to calm her nerves.
<br><br>
	"He killed his own daughter, Genn," I stated flatly, still looking at the boy whose eyes were filled with fear. "And there are probably some of his hired hands out looking for me right now as well. His own blood means nothing to my father, what do you think the life of this boy means?"
<br><br>
	The boy looked as though he was dead already by this time, and a twinge of guilt set in. I leaned closer to the fire and whispered to him, "but so long as you lead us back to my sister, Calloway will not hear of it from me." Whether this was comforting or not, I do not know. But soon enough, the lad was coiled into a corner, and fast asleep.
<br><br>
	I found sleep myself that night, but soon enough dawn was upon us, and we continued on our way into the desert of Ro.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	We were nearly to the borders of the Oasis of Marr when the boy finally stopped. He made a gesture indicating that this was the place, and then Genneth began to play. Within a few minutes, the sad streaming notes from her lute lead us directly over my sister's grave.
<br><br>
	I stood there in silence for a long while, and then without consciously being aware of it, I began to dig into the sand. For every two handfuls that I scooped up, one slid back down on to the site. After a half-hour of what must have appeared to be fruitless labor, Genneth and Rooksarii bent down and helped me dig.
<br><br>
	It was another hour before I felt the cold touch of her skin in my hands. One hand was still clenched into a fist, as if she was trying to fight off her attackers even in death, should they come back to disturb her peace. I reached down and covered her fist with both of my hands. It was all too real for me now, and as I looked upon her sand-scratched face, I began to weep.
<br><br>
	Genneth went to put an arm around me, but I just pushed her away. I reached down into the sand and pulled Lini's body up into my arms. She was so cold. Her body was stiff against my embrace, which only drove the pain of her death more deeply into my heart. I was never again to hear her laugh, to fight with her and at her side. Never would I see the likes of my sister until Quellious called me into His light, and I knew in that moment, that it would be a very long time.
<br><br>
	I let Lini go, and she fell back into the sand, grains of it already streaming down to bury her in its depths again. I stood up, and went over to the boy, Rooksarii. I unbound him, slowly, still crying even as I spoke to him. "Be gone from here child. Tell no one of what you have seen, or what you have done. And watch what company you keep, even for a rogue, the choice of Ruben Calloway is a mistake."
<br><br>
	The boy nodded, and tipped his hat to Genneth as he left. We would meet him again, much later, and under much more pleasant circumstances. But that is another story.
<br><br>
	I turned to Genneth then. "I have to go on alone from here. Bringing you with me to face my father would only endanger you. I don't want that." I glanced back at Lini's lifeless body one last time. "Call out to whomever can help you. Have them bring my sister to the guild house of the Ashen Order in Freeport, I don't want her left out here to be food for coyotes."
<br><br>
	Genneth nodded solemnly. "We'll take good care of her Maesyn." She hugged me tightly, and for once, I let her. "Just don't go rushing off to join her, we still have need of you here in Norrath."
<br><br>
	I patted her on the back, and started on my way. "Its not my time yet, Genn. I know its not." I called out to her after a few moments.
<br><br>
	"But is it your father's time?" She shouted back to me. By Quellious' light, in that moment I truly did not know. I just didn't know.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Twilight had set in by the time that I reached the southern gates of Freeport, and I could hear the horns from the docks announcing that the boat was about to leave. I strode into the city of my birth past snoozing militia guards and drunken sots who were using the walls of the city as their pillows. The sounds of tavern merriment echoed around me like a slap in the face. What right did anyone have to be happy while I suffered such pain? I chided myself silently for my arrogance. The world did not revolve around me, as I believed that it did when I was a child.
<br><br>
	With very deliberate steps, I made my way to my father's house. The store itself was closed now, but the back entrance would still give me access. I still wore its iron key around my neck, as I had each time I left the house as a child. Perhaps, in some strange way, I had hoped that the key would eventually unlock all the closed doors that had been put up between my parents and myself. Now, however, the key was to server one purpose, and after I heard the click of the lock I removed it and threw it into a pile of garbage.
<br><br>
	The house was quite dark for this time of night. Mother should have been making dinner, with Nana at her side trying to tell her how to cook it 'the right way'. Father should have been at his desk in the back room of the shop, going over what had seemed to me in my youth to be an endless stream of paperwork. Lini and I should have been upstairs, playing with our dolls until we heard Mother call us down for dinner. Shadows of the past, I thought. Shadows and lies. Lini would never hear Mother's dinner bell voice again, and after this night, I would never set foot in this house again.
<br><br>
	I made my way easily through the dark to Father's office door. I stood outside of it for a few moments, until it was clear to me that he was not inside. Then I opened the door. Candles were still lit, and his books were laid open with his spectacles left carelessly on top of them. I sat down in his big leather covered chair, trying to get a sense of the man that I had come to challenge, of the man that would rule over his children as if we were property. I knew that if I wanted to kill him that the element of surprise was the key, but I realized that I had come here for more than that. I needed to hear him speak, and I hoped against all that I knew of my father that he would redeem himself to me, and to Lini's memory some how. The child inside of me desperately wanted to make all of this right without the need for bloodshed, which would only lead to more pain.
<br><br>
	I was left little time to ponder which course of action to take, as the sound of footsteps from the upper staircase reached my ears. I turned the chair so that I was facing the door, and waited. His shadow preceded him into the doorway, with the whole of him following not long afterwards. He looked at me a long time, with those harsh eyes that had judged me mercilessly in my youth for even the most minor of indiscretions. He was unshaven, and from the looks of it, had been for several days. It made him look so much older than I remembered. Grey hairs that had not been there when I left his house shouted out at me. It was all I could do to keep from laughing. My father was mortal after all, whether he could admit it or not, and this was to my advantage.
<br><br>
	He stood his ground in the doorway as he spoke. "You've come about Lini then, I suppose." I nodded; never taking my eyes off of him, nor letting my face reveal any more than he could surmise of my purpose. "What a waste…" he continued, in a tone that reminded me of how he would speak of lost shipments for the store. "I had so much planned for her, but it was her own fault. She shouldn't have fought them, or me."
<br><br>
	He looked at me then for a long while again, waiting for a response, a movement. I gave away nothing. His hand moved across his forehead in a thoughtful repose. "So, the question is, what are you here to do little one? Have you come to kill me and avenge your sister's death? Will having my blood on your hands wipe away that pain?"
<br><br>
	"No Father," I said quietly, "it won't."
<br><br>
	He looked surprised for a brief second before his face turned emotionless once more. "You have not come home either though. You've too much pride and stubbornness to return to your rightful place so soon. But that doesn't mean that you'll be allowed to leave…"
<br><br>
	"Do you think you can hold me here, Father?" I asked, rising out of his chair and moving towards him slowly. "Do you wish to put me on a shelf and sell me to the highest bidder? Do you think that a daughter of Ruben Calloway would allow <em>that</em> to happen?"
<br><br>
	He smiled bitterly at me then, and I saw his hand move down towards his belt, where a dagger hung. He backed out of the doorway even as he was within arm's length of me. "So what have you come here for then, little girl?"
<br><br>
	"To show you the Light old man," I said. I felt something wash over me at that moment; an intangible power entered my body and guided me to my purpose. Father backed himself into a corner, and with no retreat in sight, clasped his dagger and lunged for me. I blocked the feeble attack easily, and as he positioned himself to make another, the power took complete control of me and IT began to speak.
<br><br>
	"You have been blinded by greed, old man. For your crimes, the world shall see you for the blind fool that you are, even if you can not see it yourself." My skin turned into a burning flame at that moment, and light exuded through every pore, until the entire room was engulfed in it. How long it lasted, I do not know. When the Divine Light left me, I crumpled on to the ground. I was as I had been before, unharmed, yet a greater sense of peace cloaked me. I felt no more pain for the loss of my sister, I knew now that she was truly at peace, and that she was where she belonged.
<br><br>
	I looked over to my father then. He was much changed. His skin was scorched as if he had been laid out in the sun of Oasis for endless weeks. He did not move for a long time, and when he did, the pain that it caused him was obvious. His hands felt their way along the floor trying to find me.
<br><br>
	"Maesyn…" he called out to me. "I can't see…"
<br><br>
	"No Father, you can't." I said simply, "and you never could." I turned away, and left the house and my father behind forever.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Genneth and the others were waiting for me when I reached the Ashen Order. Lini's body lay wrapped in a white shroud, prepared for its final journey to Erudin and the temple of the Divine Light, where it would be laid to rest.
<br><br>
	I laid my hands on her one last time. "I miss you more than you could ever know, Lini. But know now that His Light is with me, as it is with you. In that Light, we shall always walk together." I laid a kiss on her forehead, bid my thanks to the people that had carried her thus far, and to those that would take her the rest of the way. Then I left to sleep for the night.
<br><br>
	Several weeks afterwards, I attained my twentieth mastery as a monk. It was an honor that Lini and I had planned on celebrating together from our first days as monks. When I returned to the guild house to receive the honors of this accomplishment from my masters, Mistress Reyia was waiting for me.
<br><br>
	"The time has come for you to take a name for yourself Maesyn. You have earned that right in the Light of the Child's eyes. What will it be?" She asked.
<br><br>
	I had pondered this for a while. I could never be Ruben Calloway's daughter again, anymore than he could be my father. "Let me be known as Shadowdancer," I said. She nodded. There was no explanation needed, not when the Light was shining so brightly.
