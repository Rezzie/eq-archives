Some of you may remember the character <a href="../Issue63/posy.htm">Posy</a> I wrote about around February which wound up as the lead story in the EverQuest Strategy Guide.  I created that character on Karana and played her the very first week of final to level 4, then shelved her for other (<b>many</b> other, my god!) characters.  Recently I picked her up again, and have been having a great time blowing things up in North Ro.  Something about a cute li'l gnome wizchick tossing around mana like grenades is really appealing to me, and I have a lot of momentum with her now and I'll ride it out until some other project hits me.  Playing as a female and as a wizard brings to mind some things I wanted to share with you.
<br><br>
Wizards are a selfish class, and it's hard to run them as a "helpful" character.  They have no buffs for others except a 2-point damage shield, their spells are really geared towards kill-stealing, so there isn't much you can do when a character runs by yelling help except steal their kill.  I think that otherwise, it's a great class, and I do what little I can to help others by rooting or dumping a little fire on their foes heads without hitting them too hard.  They have no heals, no pets, no armor - and I love it.
<br><br>
I'm 15th level now and using a cracked staff and still wearing a guild tunic.  I have been given a minor gift of two +3 int earrings, but all in all this character has very little "stuff".  It makes me wonder really how deathly important it is to chase down that extra item which will give you that much of an "edge".  Now before you get all snippy, there are some things which are very important to other classes, like armor and a magic weapon for warriors - but it's really not worth stomping on other people at camps and stealing kills.
<br><br>
Otherwise, it's a very fun class, and ranks right up there with bards and clerics and druids and enchanters and magicians and … well, you see that's the problem.  I like all the classes and their balance. I have played most classes to about 15, some higher in beta, and though I've barely scratched the surface of class that begin to excel in their 30's, I think that they are really amazingly balanced.  This was a huge issue in beta and frankly, it's not the problem that we thought it would be.  Verant continues to make tweaks and changes to the classes, and this is a Good Thing.  I wouldn't want any class to be the class that someone picks because they want to get to level 50 fastest, guaranteed.

I want to welcome Gordon Wrinn (Abashi) to the hell that is the EverQuest message board community.  He has been posting several times a day with people's concerns, and a more difficult job I cannot imagine.
<br><br>
Here are some excerpts from posts that Abashi has replied to in a thoughtful and articulate way.  I wanted to add what I might say if I were given his job (these were pulled from the EQSS new page who, with EQVault, are doing a great job of tracking down Abashi's posts):
<br><br>
<em>"What makes it even worse is that Verant never bothers to inform us why they have missed the deadline. . It is a known fact among players that Verant consistently lies about their deadlines"</em>
<br><br>
<b>Oghma:</b>  Oh, yeah, they lie, mislead, and keep us in the dark.  It's only posted on every message board and on the EverQuest site and on the scrolling marquee.   Do you also have trouble reading the text screen when you play?
<br><br>
<em>"My question then is, why did GZ blatantly and publicly lie to everyone when he said there would be no further changes to classes - that they were essentially "balanced"?" </em>
<br><br>
<b>Oghma:</b> My question then is, why did you intentionally misquote and take what he said out of context and blatantly and publicly use it to support your short-sighted, my-class-sucks-because-I-can't-do-everything point?
<br><br>
<em>"God, this will teach me to roleplay. My question is, Verant, why do you try and make this a RP game at all.. Obviously its catered to the Quake player."</em>
<br><br>
<b>Oghma:</b>  I can't stand Quake and I love EQ.
<br><br>
<em>"Like any good politician, it seems to me that Abashi will only coment on the topics he chooses to comment on."</em>
 <br><br>
<b>Oghma:</b>  Ooooh did he miss replying to <b>your</b> whine?  How about we just go back to having less rather than more information?
<br><br>
<em>"it seems he wants to do the best he can, but verant is keeping him in the dark on many key issues. and he just dopesn't know the answer to most the questions thrown at him" </em>
<br><br>
<b>Oghma:</b>  Don't you know that Verant is a tool of the Illuminati? We're all in the dark, don't worry.  Verant hired Abashi to help <b>you</b>.  Go back to the Grassy Knoll.
<br><br>
<em>"Everywhere I turn in this game, Verant is screwing it up. I'm getting tired of this crap that Verant pulls, seemingly at every turn. It appears to me that Verant is doing EVERYTHING it can to stop people from advancing characters, and for what? Like a hundred other people have said, so they can hold the people's credit cards hostage for as long as possible!"</em>
<br><br>
<b>Oghma:</b> Please leave the game if you are so unhappy about your card being held hostage.  I have no troubles leveling, and will have less when you are gone.
<br><br>
<em>"Verant has created a great game for a rping enviroment, only thing is there except for the graphics and characters there is nothing to support roleplaying in the GAME! sure there are quests, but is that really rping how many times have you done a quest with out asking a friend how to, or looking at a quest site." </em>
<br><br>
<b>Oghma:</b>  Hey, someone actually completed the quest far enough to post it on a site.  I quested once through Qeynos to 5th level without checking a site or killing a monster.  I've quested through Neriak, Kaladim, Freeport, and Rivervale on varying levels without checking a site.  What's your problem?

<br><br>
Really now, I don't envy him his job.  But so far he has been doing an <b>outstanding</b> job, and I welcome his addition to the community and I applaud Verant for putting such a thoughtful and perceptive person in the position.  Another example of how Verant is continuously and actively supporting their product.

<br><br>
Enjoy this issue!
