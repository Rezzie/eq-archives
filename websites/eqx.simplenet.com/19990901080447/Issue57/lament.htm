<br><br>
Oh foggy night, the moon was barely shining, and in the wood you could hear the kobolds howl.<br>
Alone in the woods, two adventurers wander, and in the heart of one was a crime most foul.<br>
Etar...   oh Etar....  Why did you slay my humble soul?...   Etar..  oh Etar, That which you stole shall 
forever condemn you noooow!
<br><br><br>

Your soul will be devoured<br>
You will ever be my enemy<br>
Forever will you regret<br>
Dogs of War... (shouts )  to Me!
<br><br><br>

Oh foggy night, thieves run and hide in you, and you can hear the cries of their deceived.<br>
Murder and theft, a crime indeed to do it, but once again more tale do I cry to thee.<br>
Etar..  oh Etar....  Why did you steal from my corpse?  Etar.. oh Etar, your no better than the ass of a 
horse.
<br><br><br>

Your soul will be devoured<br>
You will ever be my enemy<br>
Forever will you regret<br>
Dogs of War... (shouts )  to Me!
<br><br><br>


Oh moonless night, the stars shall bear my witness, to the end of the magician I once knew.<br>
In the dawn of a day, one will find himself lifeless, and oh ETAR...  That will be you.<br>
Etar..  oh Etar....  You will forever be known as scum..  Etar.. oh Etar, the dogs of war have been 
unleashed against you!
<br><br><br>


Your soul will be devoured<br>
You will ever be my enemy<br>
Forever will you regret<br>
Dogs of War... (shouts )  to Me!!
<br><br><br>

Oh starless night, the moon is barely shining, and in the woods you can hear the kolbalds howl.<br>
Tis such a shame, for  Etar claims he innocent, but the words of his peers prove him foul.<br>
Etar..  Oh Etar, when will you change your wicked ways...  Etar oooohhh  Etar... repent, for now no one will hear you bray.
<br><br><br>

Mercy that I grant you<br>
The truth is afire<br>
beware of two edged swords<br>
Dogs of War ..(whispers)  desire
