The god Lugh, in the early Mythological Cycle tales of the Celts, was not allowed to
rule them, though he was clearly the best ruler, because his hand had been struck
off.  It was not until Dian Cecht, the healer of the Gods, grew him a new hand that
he could take his throne.

During battles, Bards were charged with recording the deeds of heroes, and would
watch the battle in order to later recount great feats of arms and might at the
feasting halls.  Bards could elevate the stature of an individual in society with
their praise, another reason why Bards were held inviolate.

Bards were cultural figures closer to priests than to entertainers, and were allowed
to pass freely for kingdom to kingdom, even between kingdoms at war.  A Bard’s
position was politically neutral, and he could not take sides in a dispute.  His task
was to discover and expose truth, and enlighten others to it with his power over
language. The Celts believed that there were three magical melodies:  the song of
healing, the song of joy, and the song of sorrow.  The bards semi-magical reputation
comes both from the three melodies and their mastery of the power of language.

Who a Bard is in Celtic culture also depends on which area he was from.  Irish and
Welsh Bards have many similarities, but as history affected the different areas
settled by the Celts, the traditions and position of the Bard changed.   The Irish
term "bard" actually refers to the lowest rank of poet, one who had not completed his
studies. The "Filidh", or seer,  was one rank higher, and was in turn out-ranked by
the "Ollave" or master-poet.
