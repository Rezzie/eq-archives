I've always been of the opinion that I am far too young to write out a will.  But since my father died at such an early age and left my family destitute, I felt it necessary to keep the Freeport tax authority from seizing all of my goods.  And after these past few days, adventuring with Absor, I've never felt so close to death.
<br><br>
I've had to have this work scribed for me.  I've gone to shops frequented by the wizard types, as they are the most literate, and managed to hire one to put down my thoughts on paper for me.  I can do little more than sign my own name, and often because I am told that my signature looks like it says "Falryx" I opt to sign with an "X" in lieu of my name.  Any flowery words you find here will be the embellishments of the scribe I hired, a high elf named Archanalia.
<br><br>
When I first was brought into the guild at the behest of my father who had all his life provided for his family by taking from others, I felt a brief sense of belonging.  People seemed pleased with my presence.  They accepted me only because my father had been a long-standing member and at his untimely demise they realized that his family would need someone else to provide for them.  But I set out to do a bit more than simple cutpurse activities.  I had a brief stint as a highwayman with a group of bandits in the Karanas, I was a pickpocket in some of the busier but less monitored areas of Qeynos, and I did a fair bit of adventuring.
<br><br>
Some of my travels took me to exotic places like Neriak, where the gloom is so overwhelming that one practically needs a torch to walk through their cavernous streets during daylight hours.  Fungus and various lichen are used for pigments, giving the place a strange neon quality that is both stunning to the eye and a bit chilling.
<br><br>
I suppose I should get to the will now.
<br><br>
<em>To Adolos</em>, my dear younger sister, I leave my daggers… a twin pair of giant snake fangs which have gotten me through most every scrape, save presumably the one that led to you receiving them.  Remember when we were children wandering the aqueducts of Freeport, sailing ships fashioned from bits of discarded parchment?  You so wanted to be a pirate, and I hope that some of that adventure has found you well by the time of this writing.
<br><br>
I recall the time we first met Jigger the Thief captain.  He stood tall with a peaked hat that made it necessary for him to duck when passing through a doorway.  He always smelled of fish and well aged cheese and his breath was that which might be stored in a liquor bottle.  His hands were always fed into his pockets, and through the hole in his coat to the daggers he kept concealed therein.  At least I always assumed it was his daggers he held.
<br><br>
In retrospect I think it was good that we did not sit on his lap as he asked.
<br><br>
<em>To Molinia</em>, my lovely mother.  I know I had been a difficult child to raise.  There was the time after father died when I was put to work by the rogue's guild and they set me to work collecting their dues from the local pickpockets.  After searching for me all day and I did not appear for dinner, you came and found me at Jenam and Rebby's, half loaded with brandy.  We were rolling dice and I was doing my best to out cheat them, which was quite a feat since they were established manipulators of the dice.
<br><br>
I remember that they greeted you and that Jenam even hugged you and asked why he had not seen you in twelve years. I remember the number because I was but 9 months short of being twelve myself, which meant that you hadn't seen Jenam since nine months before I was born.  I didn't know that you knew Jenam.  You two discussed something in hushed whispers and then Jenam came over and gave me back my gambling losses.  I think he even gave me something extra… he said that it was his father's lucky rat's whisker and that he had hoped to give it to his son some day.  Instead he gave it to me.
<br><br>
I wish dad were there to see it.  He would have been so proud of you for whatever it is you said to them.
<br><br>
So I leave to you the rat whisker that Jenam gave me.  After you left, he told me "That woman can cook in the sack!"  I figure you can sell it and get yourself some new pots and pans, as the food made in the old ones really wasn't all that good.  Perhaps it was because you didn't use a sack.
<br><br>
<em>To Erzuna Reckleave</em>, my first teacher of the felonious arts, I'd like to give you something of sentimental value: my priceless gold necklace.  'Tis a dragon with it's wings sprawled out and meeting over its head, where it upheld a bright ruby.  I've never had it appraised, but I know its magical and worth quite a bundle.
<br><br>
As I said, I'd like to give it to you.  But of course you stole it from me when I was a teen.  In its stead I leave to you the symbolic one-finger salute of my family clan.
<br><br>
<em>To Absor</em>, the shouting bard, I give my minotaur's horn.  Sure, you play the lute and the drums, but I think we've long suspected that you'd like to branch out into newer musical areas.
<br><br>
I remember the time we went to the Gorge of King Xorbb and we began to fight the mud men.  In those days we were prone to drawing a crowd with our combat prowess.  Of course, that crowd was a crowd of opponents and we were oft forced to flee for our very lives.
<br><br>
My gift to you, the minotaur's horn, should remind you of lost potential that is the inescapable effect of someone's death.  As I recall that we also had a bet over who would live longest, I also owe you 10 gold, to be deducted from the balance of my estate, as I am now dead, and in theory you are not.  You can pick up the horn in Steamfont, in the caves there.  A fellow holds the item for you, down in its depths.  Simply walk down into the cavern and shout "I've come for minotaur horns" and your gift will be shortly delivered to you.
<br><br>
To Crow, of Crow's tavern, I leave the balance of my cash once removed from the bank of Qeynos.  It is currently only a few platinum, but by the time of my death I should hope that it has increased to ten platinum or so.  If so, then I will have paid a quarter of my gambling debts.  That is, if Satyricus beats Lydell in the big gladiator event this coming week.  If he doesn't then we'll know how I died and the ten platinum should be put to other uses, like hiring a ranger to track down all of my missing parts…
<br><br>
And Lastly, to <em>Erlea Mornblow</em>, the one woman who offered herself to me in the way that most men so desire a woman, I leave my only magical possession.  A crystal knife.  You can sell it and finally pay the wizards to remove those moles from your posterior, and to electrically singe those hairs from your chin.  If there is enough left, you should finally take that trip back to Oggok to visit your distant relatives.  You were the biggest woman I knew, but that just meant there was more of you to love.
<br><br>
You were all quite special to me each in your own way, and I am sorry that I am no longer around to fight with, beside, and among you all.  Let my death have been a memorable experience and I do hope that some knowledge of mortality does creep into your thoughts when you recall whatever means by which I perished.
<br><br>
Incidentally, have my remains burned and then sprinkle the ashes over Jigger, the thief captain.  He said I'd never make anything of myself, and I'd like to show him that I have indeed been made into something.
