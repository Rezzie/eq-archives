After reading about the anonymous <a href="../Issue46/nextgen.htm">tale</a> about EQ's youngest tester, I reflected on how my own daughter adapted to video games. She is three and a half years old and has been trying to play video games for about a year. It is interesting to me how quickly kids will learn these things that young.
<br><br>
	At first moving Mario around in the 3D world was a challenge to her with the roving camera, but it kept her interest long enough to find a few simple goals like opening the castle door. To her this was a major accomplishment, as she could identify the objects in the game as something we have in real life. "Daddy I opened the door!"
<br><br>
	She quickly found that when the video game prevented her from moving as she liked, she should press different buttons. She would come across an obstacle and learned that if she pressed a certain button Mario would jump over it. This button was a problem solver now. Next she found it worked for bad guys too. Anytime a baddie hurt Mario she jumped, and it is surprising how easy it is to land on these baddies. Problem solved.
<br><br>
	She tried out all the other games I own, and has her preference now. She definitely likes multi-player games better, and seems to like the racing games for the simple concept. Hold down the go button, stay on the road, and press Z when you get an item.
<br><br>
	I wish they made more games for children her age. I was insulted when looking at some of the SNES games made for the younger kids. I found that other games aimed at kids seem either too linear to keep her interest (think rails and one action button) or still too complex for the target audience (think Kirby). My daughter seems to like my games better than children's games for the same reason I do: eye candy, music, sound effects and depth.
<br><br>
 	It seems to me that children are learning today's technology younger and younger. My daughter has already expressed an interest in the computer although she can only operate the mouse and arrow keys so far. Some game players might note that usually that is the primary control for half of the games already on the market. When she gets into school I imagine she will be learning to read on the computer, among other things.
<br><br>
	I hope we see more children's games on the market, ones with less gore, less sex and more productivity than the teen flare-ups we have now. My daughter has already pointed out in two different games that a lead character seemed to be missing an article of clothing (Killer Instinct and Tomb Raider), and this shows me just how impressionable our children are. 
<br><br>
	I would think there was a reasonable market in the younger kids for video games, but I might be wrong. Then again, I am a consumer; humor me.
