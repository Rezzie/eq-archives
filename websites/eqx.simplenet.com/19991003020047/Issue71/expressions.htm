 Hi,I've noticed the racism in EQ. Elves and Orcs. Dark Elves & Humans. And the same with differant classes too. Why is this? And which races dis-like which races???

Well, we've probably covered this a few times here, but it's worth covering again.  And I think this time we'll look at it in light of the new, soon to arrive in a theater near you, Star Wars movie.
<br><br>
I remember sitting in a theater with a crowd of 'first showing' folks for one or the other of the Star Wars movies.  You know the ones, the folks that camp out for days to get into the first showing of the movie, and then buy me a ticket anyway, even though I spent those days sitting at home watching television.  The types that cheered when Han Solo appeared the first (second and third) time.  The folks that actually hissed when Vader appeared.  Well, if you're a fantasy buff, be it books or roleplaying games (or both), then those folks are you too.  Because clear, distinct and definable 'good' and 'evil' are very important to most good fantasy tales.
<br><br>
Oh, sure, Vader started out and ended up a 'good' guy.  But you always knew which side he was on.  And for most of his time on screen, he was the antagonist.  Personally I have a gripe with the whole idea of clear-cut good and evil, antagonist/protagonist relationships in games and books.  But I'll save that for a later discussion, because I can also see how useful they are.  It is a lot easier to get into a character if you know who he or she is.  And it helps to drive the drama of the tale if you can have an epic sense of the struggle.  How fun would it have been if Luke and Darth were struggling over the power of sortof-good and kinda-evil?  How enthusiastic would we have been in cheering on the good guys if we thought that they were just in it to win the heart of the girl?  Note that the play off between Luke and Han for the affections of the Princess were a sub-plot to the grander good versus evil thing.
<br><br>
Racial hatred is how EverQuest, and many other games, reproduce this good versus evil theme.  I suspect that it's clear to everyone that plays EverQuest that the Tier'dal are evil, and that the High Elves are good.  And it should be equally clear that they hate each other (remember the story of the origins of the Tier'dal?).  Imagine a High Elven paladin, noble and fair, meeting a Tier'dal warrior, dangerous and sleek, in a clear and beautiful glade.  Picture the dialogue, the hatred dripping from the tongue of the dark one as he insults the paladin, the calm and stoic voice of the fair one responding with only sorrow for the death he must give his foe.  It is the racial conflict that drives the world of Norrath.  While Humans may kill each other one on one over issues of religion or profession, they will band together to drive off a Gnoll invasion.  As selfish as they may seem, even the residents of Freeport might rush to the aid of the Halflings of Rivervale if their mutual enemies attacked.
<br><br>
If all the player controllable races were allied (or, heck, if there was only one race), the only racial conflict available would be between the PCs and the NPCs.  And, personally, I really don't think the NPCs can hold up their end of the dramatic scene I mentioned above...
<br><br>
Hifnera, beautiful High Elven paladin, loyal follower of Tunare, steps forward, knowing that she can not avoid the upcoming battle.  She does not fear for her life, but her soul.  She is well aware that the dark one she faces is truly her cousin.  She knows that only the terrible machinations of the Lord of Hate has twisted this child.  She hopes, beyond all reasonable belief that she will succeed, to convince the dark one to change his ways.
<br><br>
"Stop!  I do not wish to battle you this day.  I wish to speak to you, D'vayn T'fla.  I know of your..."
<br><br>
D'vayn T'fla slashes you for 25 points of damage.<br>
D'vayn T'fla slashes you, but misses!
<br><br>
"We are brethren!  We were both born of Tunare!  Your hatred is forced upon you by..."
<br><br>
D'vayn T'fla slashes you for 30 points of damage.<br>
D'vayn T'fla slashes you for 17 points of damage.
<br><br>
Hifnera sighs<br>
"Well then, if I can not convince you with words, I shall attempt to convince you with steel."
<br><br>
D'vayn T'fla slashes you for 25 points of damage.<br>
D'vayn T'fla slashes you, but misses!
<br><br>
So our heroin gets big points for roleplaying in this situation.  However she gets herself killed while trying to talk to a computer controlled character that can't even appreciate her efforts.  That's why we need other people playing Tier'dal.  And they need real people playing the High Elves.
<br><br>
And shame on you for asking for a list of all the hatreds and loves of the races!  You outta know that I'm not gonna give you one...
