Hey all.
<br><br>
This is sad.  I have been so busy this week that I can't even remember what I wrote last week.  Hang on a minute while I go and read it…
<br><br>
…
<br><br>
Well, what a bunch of crap that was.  I can't believe that you waded through that last week and came back again.  It amazes me sometimes when I find myself doing things (like reading editorials) out of habit.  Not because they are fun, just because they are there.  I might even think afterwards 'well, that sucked.  I wonder if it will suck next time.'  And I go right back to it.
<br><br>
That's kinda what roleplaying has been like for me lately.  I mean, I have fun and all.  But sometimes after a game, as I'm trying to stuff all the gamer trash into my poor little trashcan…  What is it about gamers that makes them leave so much stuff behind them wherever they go?  Fast food containers, two liter soda bottles, paper in all stages of messed up, books, binders, shoes…
<br><br>
Oh, yeah, is roleplaying still fun for me, or is it habit?  Well sometimes it takes a truly bad experience to remind you of the good ones.  Two weeks ago instead of writing that pap, I should have been telling you about the game we had.  Eeeeks.  I may rant about "our GM", from time to time, but last week he deserved a rant and I didn't even give him one.  That session might have been the most boring, tedious, frustrating thing I've ignored all year!  We couldn't advance the plot, there didn't even seem to be one.  No clues, no direction, no NPCs worth talking to, nothing.  We wandered aimlessly, suffering the inevitable lacerations and crippling physical and mental torture without ever feeling like we were getting anywhere.
<br><br>
Now I can see some of you out there, you GMs, waving your fingers at me.  I can read your lips through the monitor.  "The GM can't do everything!  You players have to do something too.  You are always blaming a bad game on us.  But we worked hard on the game, you should at least put some effort into playing it!"
<br><br>
And I won't deny it, we are one of the laziest bunch of gamers you'll ever meet.  Heck, you already know that several of us sleep during the games.  But this time it was completely the GMs fault.  He just wasn't up to his usual good stuff.  And we expressed our opinions about it, loudly and with lot's of spittle.
<br><br>
So this last weekend our beloved (how do I make that sound as mocking as I mean it to be?) GM decided to offer us some choices.  He gave us the option to continue the current game (with some vague promise that it would be better) or one of two others that he had in mind.  We voted, yup, voted.  And we decided to play the same crappy game and see if the improvements came through.
<br><br>
Can you see where I'm going with this?  Some of you have been playing Ultima Online for a long time now.  Some of you do it just because it's there, it's convenient and because it's a habit.  You yell for change, but never see it.  You get promises, sure, but they never amount to anything.
<br><br>
Now I'm not trying to single out UO, I know a lot of places that this happens (you should see what I go through at work!).  But the key is that you don't have to put up with anything that is inadequate.  If you don't like UO, and all the screaming and foaming doesn't' make it better, then don't play.  If EverQuest *Absor bites his tongue* does not meet your expectations and does not change when you need it to, don't play.
<br><br>
To some of you this may be a silly and obvious point.  But some of you are like me, rutt-bound.  And it's folks like us that keep the status quo.  We are just as guilty as our GMs for the bad game or any of the bad products that we buy more than once.
<br><br>
Oh, and the game got much better.  A bit weirder, but much better.  So bust your rutt!
