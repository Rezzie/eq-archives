Hoi there all! Lrets D'pearl here with the latest and greatest news across the lands of Norrath. I must start off by giving a formal apology to all ye readers for being absent the past couple o' weeks, but what with the past Millenium celebrations an' all the guest performances that fans of mine were clamoring for me to attend ... yeesh! I can't belive I was able to make it at even this time! :P 
<br><br>
An' if'n ye don't belive how wild an' crazy it got ... take a gander at what I woke up next to on New Years Day!

<em>Yeesh! I was just glad of 2 things when I woke up: 1. This big feller didna roll in his sleep and 2. We BOTH had our clothes on in the morning!!!</em>
<p style="text-align: justify">
In any case ... I followed up that whole Wayeee-TU-KaY Demon bug thingamajig, and was unable to find ANYTHING! Yeesh! imagine my disappointment! This coulda been the scoop of the Century ... errr I mean Millenium .... errr or maybe I should say Decade??? ... oh heck!!! How bout Scoop of the Year! Yeesh! :) So here I am trundlin about ALL over Norrath to sniff out this scoop and the only thing I could find was a buncha Trants getting zonked as they celebrated the end of the year. Yeesh!

<em>So here I am hunting for a scoop about the coming of the dreaded Wayeee-TU-Kay Demon bug and the ONLY thing that I find is a bunch drunken Trants .. and to add insult to injury .. I come to EQ Express and our receptionist tells me she trashed all our appointments and schedules for this year cuz she thought all papers dated 00 referred to old Norrathian historical references! Yeesh!</em>
 
<p style="text-align: justify">

Oh yes! one more thing ... my congrats to all ye mighty adventurers that heard me challenge in me last article. It was with tears welling in my eyes and awe filled gratitude that I received this magic globe image of some adventurers who took me challenge to heart and caught those pervo mino's and muddites in the middle of one their despicable perversions ... and wiped them out! YAY!!! Here's one for the moral majority of Norrath! :)

<em>Nothing is more gratifying than knowing that someone, somewhere took me words to heart and acted on them :) Oh! BTW I COULD also use a nice beachfront cottage on the Freeport Coast and anyone without any need of their really unnecessary NO DROP LORE Items are free to send them all the EQ Express C/O Lrets D'pearl) </em>
