If you read EverQuest Express regularly then you've probably read a few articles about roleplaying certain classes, like Paladins and Bards, and certain races, like Dwarves and Tier'dal.  We've covered nearly all the bases.  And officially EverQuest doesn't have alignments, but many of us view the world of fantasy with the ideas of 'good', 'evil' and 'neutral' in our minds.  Now many of our articles have hit on the ideals of good and evil pretty squarely.  How much more can you learn about evil if you've read <a href="../Issue61/religion1.htm">Religion and Race: The Dark Elves</a> by Oghma?  If you've read <a href="../Issue69/politics5.htm">The Politics of Nobility - Role Playing a High Elf</a> by Ian Ash, then you know a lot about goodness.  I want to talk about roleplaying a neutral character in EverQuest.
<br><br>
Shades of Gray... that was the title of a book that I once wrote.  Well, technically I co-wrote it with two other guys.  And calling it a book is extremely generous.  And you'll note that I wasn't even brave enough to mention whether or not it was good.  At least the concept was a good one.  Each of us would write from the point of view of a different group.  They would conflict, yet each side would seem to be in the right.  The reader would understand why each side could be considered right and be able to sympathize with them.  In the end it would turn out that each group was both right and wrong.  Only after each group destroyed the evil within itself would there be any resolution.
<br><br>
That was the plan.  But when it was all done, we had one group that was good, one evil and one neutral.  It seemed unavoidable.  I don't know if it was some sort of quirk with the writers, that two of us couldn't write neutral, or if it's just the way it has to be.  If you want a conflict, you need a good side and a bad side.
<br><br>
But do you need anyone in the middle?  Do you need a neutral?
<br><br>
Strictly speaking, no, not really.  Read any of the 'bulk' fantasy novels and you'll see what I mean.  Heck, go watch Star Wars and you'll know what I mean (probably Phantom Menace too, but I haven't seen it).  There are the good guys and the bad guys.  Even Han Solo, dedicated neutral smuggler that he was, is a good guy before it's all over.  That's a big part of why that movie was so popular.  It was easy to identify the hero, you knew who to root for.  No confusion.  Less confusion means more screaming for Luke and more hissing at the Emperor.
<br><br>
And that's just fine for some sorts of entertainment.  But for me the essence of roleplaying is in the gray areas.  It's in the decision that a paladin has to make when it comes to prisoners.  Sure, he's an enemy and he'll most likely attack me again later if I let him go now.  But there is no way I'll get him to the authorities; we're too far out.  I can't kill him, that would be murder.  And if I leave him tied up, he'll be killed by the bears that live near here...  It's the times when things aren't so black and white that make for interesting characters.  The decision a character makes when facing a gray area tend to be the most pivotal in his life.  For the thief to choose to steal from the rich merchant is not a big event.  But deciding whether or not to follow guild orders to actually murder someone is a milestone event for him.  And I guess that's why a lot of my characters end up being neutral.  I like it when a character reaches a pivotal moment.
<br><br>
Characters like Absor.  He's a bard.  Not the sing-song, story-telling kind of bard, but the hard-nosed, negotiator type of bard.  He doesn't see a Dark Elf and immediately think that he's evil.  He's certainly open to the idea that he's <b>probably</b> evil, but he won't assume that he is until he's had a chance to see him in action.  And he's not willing to accept that all High Elves are noble, that all Dwarves are stubborn, or that all Halflings are thieves.  He tries to see the individual before he sees the stereo-type.  And he tries very hard to make people see him the same way.  It's also important to him that he gets along with every rational being he meets.
<br><br>
Radvar, on the other hand, doesn't care one bit about being liked.  If you hate him, he shrugs.  If you threaten him, he kills you if he thinks you're actually dangerous, and laughs at you if you're not.  He sells his skill to people that need it.  On occasion he actually does a good deed.  On occasion he cheats at cards.  Once in a while he'll beat the heck out of a beggar, just because he didn't want to be touched at that moment.  And sometimes he'll buy candy for a child.  No, he's not psychotic.  He's just not able, or willing, to see much beyond the moment.  He's not planning ahead.  He refuses to guess where his soul will go when he dies.  The rhetoric of the priests sounds like a bunch of self-deception to him.  And since he knows he's going to die young, he's not going to bend his ideals to meet anyone else's definition of what is right or wrong.  He just acts the way he feels like acting.  He's still aware of the consequences of his actions, and he considers them, but he isn't concerned about right and wrong.  But he's basically a moral person, but that's more of a bit of luck rather than his willingness to conform to society.  His internal feeling of right and wrong are pretty much in line with the world around him, and that is the only reason that he isn't considered a complete sociopath.
<br><br>
And, as different as they are, both of these characters are neutral.  In the system used by AD&D, Radvar is True Neutral and Absor is Lawful Neutral.  There are other ways to be neutral.  A druid could be neutral in an aggressive way, striving actively to keep nature safe, not concerned if those harming the world think they are good or not.  Or a character could be neutral with the belief that keeping the forces of good and evil in balance is important because allowing one the upper hand would mean the destruction of the world.  Evil would ruin the world, enslaving or destroying it, and good would stagnate the world, allowing it to die for a lack of vitality and variety.
<br><br>
Taking this concept of neutrality into Norrath is pretty easy.  Let's start with the religious side of things.  The first obvious choice for a neutral is to be agnostic.  Radvar is an agnostic.  A character that does not acknowledge the gods of the world, or refuses to worship them has a wide range of choices.  His actions are not judged by any standards of a higher being, at least not so that it directly affects his life.  But the character pays for the freedom from religion by being judged more harshly for his lack of faith.  Those of all faiths will look down on him because he isn't even brave enough or smart enough to recognize the power of the gods.  For the agnostic there is no refuge.
<br><br>
In fact, worshipping any god in Norrath sets you on one side or the other.  Absor worships Tunare.  He loves her with a passion.  If he was of a different mindset, he'd have made a great priest in her worship.  And with that love he is not set in the middle, but off to one side.  He will defend the children of our Mother with word and deed.  So in several select cases, he just isn't objective.  For his worship, most Gnolls hate him.  That is, of course their narrow-mindedness.  He tells himself that he will treat each Gnoll as an individual.  Unfortunately, even the individuals attack him...
<br><br>
Worshipping nature is most often considered a fairly neutral view.  This is probably because the creatures of the forests and plains of the world are, essentially, neutral.  The bears don't align themselves along political or moral lines.  Trees, heck even Treants, don't care much about what you may have done in your life.
<br><br>
Bristlebane has a few sides to his worship.  Choosing the mischievous side of this god is a good option for a neutral character.  Worshiping Bristlebane because of his love of theft isn't particularly middle of the road, as greed and theft are considered wrong, morally.  Karana the Rainkeeper is a great choice.  He's a god of weather, worshiped by farmers for good crops and perhaps the adventurous for his wild and nomadic ways.  Karana followers are realists and very aware of the dangers of the world, and helpful to those in trouble.  Again, gods of nature make perfect gods for a neutral character.  Prexus, the Ocean Lord, is basically a god of nature for the seas, worshiped by those that live in the ocean and make their living on the ocean.  Another nature god.  And for the barbarians there is the Tribunal.  A somewhat harsh god, but one of justice, not honor.  Fair and harsh is a very solid attitude for a neutral.  I picture a paladin that fails to understand love.  He still wishes justice, but has trouble seeing good and evil, only right and wrong.  The difference is subtle, but it's there.
<br><br>
Now it is certainly possible to be neutral and worship any god in Norrath.  But this will usually mean being a somewhat less that loyal worshipper.  The Tier'dal that worships Innoruuk but doesn't really hate anyone is going to be stretching his faith.  Most likely worshipping the Father of Hate only because it's expected, giving lip service to Hate, but not feeling it so deeply.
<br><br>
There is also race to consider.  The most obvious races for a neutral character are Humans and Half-Elves.  Humans are the race with the broadest variety of morals.  It is just as easy to picture a Human paladin as it is to picture a Human necromancer.  The same applies to Barbarians and Erudites who are, after all, essentially Humans.  Half-Elves have the blood of Humans in them.  A Half-Elf could have been raised by Elves or Humans.  He could suffer from a lack of acceptance in either Elven or Human societies, leaving him between worlds and in a unique position to understand all sides of many issues.  Of course it could also breed contempt or hatred...
<br><br>
Just like your choice of gods for your character, any race <em>could</em> be neutral.  I shy away from the idea of Dark or High Elves being neutral.  I've always considered their tendency to be evil or good part of their blood and culture.  The same applies to Trolls and Ogres.  But there is always the rebel in any group, the anomaly.  And sometimes playing the anomalous character is great fun.
<br><br>
 And after all, it's the fun that makes the game.  For some playing the hero is fun.  Saving the princess, slaying the dragons and feeding the hungry is the essence of the role, it's where the fun is.  For some it's being the villain.  But most of the time for me it's being in the shadows, the places between light and dark.  It's understanding the moral morass and trying to stay out of it.  If you haven't, try it.  You might like it.
