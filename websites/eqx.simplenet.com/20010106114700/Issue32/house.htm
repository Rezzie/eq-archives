I was indeed an artist.  I worked in blood.  I worked in bone.  Swords were my brushes and flesh my palette.  The gods watched and pondered and critiqued as I lay my works out flat on the ground in the gallery of battle, one atop another.  And I could still see the carnage I crafted as I lay in bed and attempted sleep.
<br><br>
Nothing distresses an artist more than when he begins to understand his own work.
<br><br>
So I went back to the workshop where Eschendon had attempted to put me to work.  Earlier in the evening I had pawed at clay and smeared berry scented dyes in a vain attempt to curb my passions into something less…bloody.
<br><br>
I climbed the stairs to Eschendon's workshop.  Outside the door I listened to the rhythmic clatter of Eschendon's hammer on anvil.  There was a sort of music in it.  For a moment I felt the battlefield beneath me and heard the blades punching through breastplates, mistook the fire in the kiln for the bonfires where the bodies burned.  I walked through the door and I was up to my knees in them…the bodies of victims, some of which were mine.
<br><br>
I felt their accusations.  Their stares seemed to beg answers to the question I myself had; The question of why I, a simple shepherd just three weeks prior, walked away from my flock, exchanged my staff for something curved and serrated, and embraced death.
<br><br>
Everywhere.  They were everywhere.  Their eyes were deep hollow pits where their souls had once been stored.  Their mouths as vacuous as and cold as the grave.  And I wanted to run, but I trod through them, pulling my feet loose of the red mud made by the unnatural union of blood and dirt.
<br><br>
I fell at last just inches from what was left of a building; A free standing wall and a single window pane.  On my knees I stared up through the pane at the silently spinning moon.  And for a moment something in me snapped.  I put my hands up to the glass and pounded as if hoping to bring down that moon I spied.  And the glass broke.  I stared at my hands and my blood dripping down my hands.
<br><br>
And I was back in the workshop.  Eschendon's hammer had stopped due to the shatter of glass.  He came around the corner and saw me where I knelt on the floor before what I suppose had been a pane of stained glass.
<br><br>
"I'm…. I'm sorry," I said, unable to think of what else to say or what had happened to me.  He didn't seem angry.  He just considered me for a moment.
<br><br>
"It was unfinished," Eschendon said, brushing the sweat away from his brow, "It was Mirak's."
<br><br>
I knew he meant this as if to say there was no chance that Mirak would complain, since he was the last of my victims.
<br><br>
"Have Durrill tend your wounds," he said and walked away.
<br><br>
It had come to this.  My loosening grip on reality had brought destruction to Mirak's Legacy.  I hadn't only destroyed the man, but one of the few pieces of evidence we had that he existed.
<br><br>
I decided to pick up the pieces of glass rather than leave Aklose to clean up all my messes.  And that's when the strangest thing happened.
<br><br>
I was picking up the colored shards when their symmetry, or lack there of, began to fascinate me.  I sorted the pieces, turned them about on the ground.  The longer I looked, the more I saw the patterns.  I don't know how long I juggled the pieces about on the floor until at last an image began to emerge to me… The outline of a dark form wreathed in white.

Eschendon grunted one last time then wiped his brow.  The window was in place.
<br><br>
I felt honored that he would want my work displayed in his home, but truth be told, I was proud of it.  It had been a long strange trip that brought me to the completion of this work of art.
<br><br>
I think I spent much of my last day in the house of rain standing in that hall, feeling the water drip on my face, and just staring at what I had accomplished.
</td></table>
I put my swords to rest after that.  There were other implements, other mediums of art that pleased me far more than crafting cold death.  And with this new way of life came a new name.  I left my birth name in that house.  I took the name Archanalia, for all my works in the house of miracles had included arches in some form or other; High rainbows at first, then bridges, the arc of caves, the bend of lightning streaks.  They worked their way into many of my works.
<br><br>
The day after I put the window in place I left that manor and set out to the west. 
<br><br>
It was some time later that I came to find out whose war into which I had trespassed.  And while the details of victory are not so important this story, there is one fact that is:  While the battle had indeed been decided, it's end had come seven years ago.
<br><br>
I had spent seven years in the house of rain, or perhaps in madness wandering the wilderness.  But regardless of how I had spent my time, it turns out that no matter how far I traveled, it was not the last time I would see that house.
<br><br>
Perhaps I'll tell you of my return there.  Someday.
