When I first launched my alter ego into the world of Britannia with the
initial release of Ultima Online, I fully expected to encounter an
immersive, richly detailed world where I could submerge myself in the
personae of a noble warrior seeking the way of the Avatar.
<br><br>
Almost a year later, I realize just how wrong I really was. Ultima
Online is the greatest creation that never was, a world of potential and
incredible dimension that fails to deliver on so many fronts that the
one feeling almost everyone can agree on is disappointment. Whether or
not you think the lawsuit against OSI is well founded or a piece of
tripe (I happen to fall into the latter category), everyone seems to
agree that it simply doesn't measure up to anyone's expectations.
<br><br>
So, why would Everquest be any different?
<br><br>
From the hundreds of pages of dialogue and conversation which has been
passed back and forth comparing Ultima Online and the still Beta
Everquest, one very simple difference has emerged. And more than
anything else, that simple difference may spell defeat for UO, and
victory for Everquest. Just what is that difference?
<br><br>
Role versus roll.
<br><br>
Ultima Online, at its core, is nothing more than a munchkins dream, the
power gamers masterpiece made reality. The poorly designed combat system
makes certain combinations of skills deadly, and others monumentally
useless. Loopholes in the game system render the average player
powerless against individuals who view UO as nothing more than a top
down version of Quake. Worst of all, Ultima Online commits the cardinal
sin of the Role Playing Game. It emphasizes statistics over game play,
and offers no real rewards to taking on the role you play.
<br><br>
Everquest, on the other hand, offers something that UO lacks. Character.
UO is a shell, little more than a graphical chat room which allows
combat. The flavour and story of Britannia, so pervasive in the CRPG
series, is completely, utterly absent in UO. Everquest's rich background
is already evident in the races and classes which they are offering as
options to play. Trolls. Dark Elves. Gnomes. All possess their own
stories, background, and in many instances, gods. Deities and their
worshippers will play a role in player interaction, and not just as idle
participants. Every indication points to the Everquest Development team
taking the background story and using it to enrich gameplay, and not
just use it as window dressing.
<br><br>
Why is there such a profound difference between the two games? Both are
backed by large corporations with deep pockets (Electronic Arts is no
slouch, and Sony is…well…Sony). Both have talented programmers at their
disposal. Why the profound difference in approach to an online RPG?
<br><br>
Attitude.
<br><br>
Raph Koster, lead developer on Ultima Online, has repeatedly stated his
beliefs that PK switches are not an option, that players should take the
lead in policing the online sociopathic elements if they want to build
an online community, and constantly stated that it is not their job to
provide full time quests for the players. All of this is true, if you
view Ultima Online as a graphics based MUD or MOO, an online social
experiment if you will, and little more. 
<br><br>
And therein lies the problem. Role Players, dedicated gamers who want to
immerse themselves in a rich gaming world, have nothing to look forward
to. Player Killing is rampant, and uncontrolled by code based fixes that
OSI tries to put in. Harassment is endemic, and persistent. And there is
no ongoing storyline which players can feel a part of. No world in which
the players can immerse themselves. It has become an overglorified chat
room.
<br><br>
Everquest offers an alternative. A chance to play something other than a
set of numbers and algorithms. You have the chance to become an Erudite
Necromancer, or a nefarious thief looking out after his own back and no
one else. It offers options without the burden of necessity. From all
indications (slim though they are at this point) your decision to play a
warrior will not place you at the complete mercy of other player types
for well over a year (do I sound bitter? My warrior has laboured under
the UO combat system for over a year, forever inferior). Your decision
will not be based on faulty game mechanics or the latest weapon of
choice. Your decision will be based on what you WANT to play.
<br><br>
And that, more than anything else, will make Everquest an Online ROLE
Playing game.
