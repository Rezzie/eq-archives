While reviewing the usual EverQuest™ web sites I caught a glimpse of a momentous screen shot Brad McQuaid sent us here at EQXPress.  A fighter stands poised, ready to engage a mammoth snake as it slithers towards him.  The scene looks exalting.  I started picturing myself walking in that cave; my friends behind me, searching for treasures from our wildest dreams.
<br><br>
Man!  I just get so excited the more I read about this upcoming title EverQuest™.   I have even started to prepare my wife.  An imminent gaming extravaganza is in my near future.

So with that warm fussy feeling I decided to write this outline of my schedule this summer.  
<br><br>
<b>First Phase Beta:</b>
<br><br>
I don’t think I’ll make this cut.  Not that I don’t have enough experience, but I just don’t have that kind of luck. So for that time period I’ll feed off the other testers, as they post their stories on the web sites.  <em>This will be the longest wait for me.  Knowing that others are testing code by actively playing this game without me.</em>

<b>Second Phase Beta:</b>
<br><br>
Hopefully by this time I’ll have begun to participate in the testing.  Depending on the magic system, I plan to play my usual good-hearted mage.   
<br><br>
I imagine the servers will be down most of the day for upgrades, so I’ll be playing at night.  I can imagine myself starting at about five o’clock, and playing on till about one or two o’clock in the morning.  I’ll do the customary ritual of reasoning with myself that the body can function fine on five hours sleep…ok four hours sleep…. Well I’m sure I’ll be ok with three hours sleep…ah hell I’m up this late, I’ll just stay up till its time to get ready for work.
