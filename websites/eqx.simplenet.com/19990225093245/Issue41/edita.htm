I was recently reminded of a challenge that I was issued.  I was never forced to resolve this challenge because the opportunity never came up.  But soon I will have to respond.  You see, several months ago I went off on a rant at a game session.  I don't remember exactly what set it off.  I'm certain that I was justified in my rant, though.  I went ballistic, complaining that nobody in our group could play a magic-user without blasting the party on accident - EVERY DAMN WEEK!  A fireball here, a lightning bolt there.  A cloud of noxious gas that overlaps the front line fighters, me, incapacitating them and leaving the skeletons (THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE LUNGS, YOU IDIOT!) unaffected.  Why can't any of you play a mage that doesn't screw the party all the time!
<br><br>
<b>Then you do better.</b>
<br><br>
Er...
<br><br>
You see, I tend to play the easy stuff.  Bards are second nature to me.  If there is a class designed to let me talk my way out of a problem, I'll play it.  Or I play a warrior.  That allows me to be a smart-ass and have the strength of arm to back it up.  Sure, I fumble and stab folks, but that is beyond my control.  You can yell at my dice for that.  I do.  So I suppose that I haven't really tackled the challenge of playing a spell caster.  It's not because I have any fear of screwing up the spells.  I KNOW that undead don't breathe.  It's because I'm too lazy to learn all the intricacies of the spells.  I don't want to have to memorize the area of affect of a fireball.  I don't really have the energy to read what you can and can't charm.  I like to leave my brain empty.  With that kind of room I can cobble together great lies, fibs and tales quickly.  I need the room in there to think!
<br><br>
But soon we start a new campaign.  Soon I will be forced to prove that I can do better.  I'm not too worried about that part.  Heck, if I screw it up I plan to have enough mental space left over to convince the group that it was someone else's fault.  I'll let you know how that turns out...
<br><br>
And it seems like that's a skill that I'll need to play EverQuest.  Ok, I already have the talent to play a warrior.  But is there really going to be any value in my ability to lie?  How useful will my skill at comprehending an in game political situation be?  How often am I going to be called upon to turn a conversation just before it goes somewhere it does not need to be?  Heck, I type at a fair speed, but I just can't work the room the same way in text.
<br><br>
I know that EverQuest will be an adventure based game.  I know that there will be quests.  But clever talk and AI don't mix too well.  All I can hope for is the occasional soothing of party conflicts and the rare GM controlled NPC.  Nope, I'll have to adjust my play style a bit.
<br><br>
So I'll learn to cast spells, influence the world through sheer magical power.  And I'll show them that you CAN throw a bolt of lightning without blowing the limbs off the warrior.  Sure, he can take it, but maybe he just doesn't want to.
<br><br>
Oh, and I have my own challenge.  Let's see how they get along without the fast talker.  Let's see if anyone else in the group can spare us one fight in four by talking his way around it.  Let's see them screw the party when they talk us <b>into</b> a fight with the thieves guild...
