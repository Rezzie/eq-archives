I recently had the pleasure of attending the Electronics Entertainment
Expo (E3) in Atlanta.  There, I was treated to dazzling displays by the
big names in computer entertainment, complete with colored lights, smoke
machines, live mascots, loud music, and any method of attracting attention
that could be safely executed in a crowded environment.  And then, away
from the noise and away from the crowds, at the end of a quiet hallway, 
Sony Interactive Studios America had a meeting room.  It was a pleasure to be
able to get a hands-on demo of EverQuest without having to shout
over arcade noises and theme songs played over loudspeakers.

Let me start off this article by answering a couple burning questions.  Beta 
has not started yet.  They only have in-house testers right now.  They
expect beta to start anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks.  Secondly, yes the game does

<b>Creating a Character</b>
<br><br>
When you first create your character, you chose a race, name, and gender and 
can select one of five faces (more will be added).  The faces are different 
for males and females, obviously, and there is even at least one bearded female
dwarf.  There is a fairly strict selection of classes based on which race 
you chose.  The following is a table showing all of the combinations available.
