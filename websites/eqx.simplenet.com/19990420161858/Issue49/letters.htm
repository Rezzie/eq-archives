Hail!
<br><br>
First, I want to let you know that I enjoy EQ Express! I am new to the EQ
world and find it very enlightening. It is really helping me get a feel for
the world.
<br><br>
Second, in Oghma's article, "<a href="../Issue48/clans.htm">Dwarven Clans</a>"
he stated,
<br><br>
"This was an attempt to build a dwarven ethos and history, without any
Norrath background. None of it is official!"
<br><br>
I must say I am impressed! I have done some writing myself and know how hard
it is to put something like this together. I was wondering if there is more
information out there on the history/races of Norrath or do we have to wait
for the January release? I am partiularly interested in the Dwarves.
<br><br>
Anyways, keep up the good work! I look forward to your next issue.

<em>[Ed. As far as I know, there is no other official information available about
the ethos and history of Norrath.  We've done our best as a fan site to help
convey some feel for Norrath.  We wait with as much anticipation as you do to
see what will happen.  You may want to read <a href="../credits/ozy.htm">The Travelers Tales</a>, these stories
are more solidly based on the real Norrath than most...]</em>

Huhu,  great <a href="../Issue48/clans.htm">article</a> in EQ Express Issue 48. We are a  German EQ Guild 
for Dwarves, Gnomes and Halflings, the Decent Folks Guild. We  would like 
to translate your fine text in German and set it on our Homepage.  Would 
you allow that?
<br><br>
Bye,  Tolund.
<br><br>
<em>[Ed. Absolutely!  And I personally want to thank Oghma for such a great article.]</em>
