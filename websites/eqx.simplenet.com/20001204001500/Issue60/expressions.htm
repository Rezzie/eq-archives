<em>Mandos:
<br><br>
What kind of God should I worship?  The descriptions give no idea of what the Gods are like...as a Dwarven Cleric, who believes in right and wrong, punishing the wicked and defending the righteous..who should I worship?
<br><br>
Grumn "who you callin short?!?" Ironring:
<br><br>
Are players "required" to choose a god? or can they choose to be agnostic =)? if agnostic, how will that affect clerics? 
<br><br>
Tageus Necrobane:
<br><br>
Does a cleric's god have an influence on the character other than RP?  What freedom of choice do clerics have when choosing a god? Can a halfling for example worship the Dark Elf prince of hate (Innock or something) or is he/she forced into a life of serving the thievery god (Bristlebane or close to this)?  I assume with further expansions new gods will be added to the EQ world but will a cleric of one god later after creation be able to choose a new god because in his/her heart they know that this new god is the "right" god for him/her?  Or will the change strip him of his powers till he completes a quest, etc.
<br><br>
Marrow:
<br><br>
I've been reading EQ pages since I got my P-4 authorization note a lil before christmas, and I've learned about as much about the game as I can w/o really playing it. One thing though that I am not too sure about is Religion. What hurts your standing with a god? Also.. if a 'good character' is hunting with a 'bad character' (IE a paladin and a shadow knight to put it at an extreme) do the gods/guilds take offense to this?</em>
<br><br><br>

	<b>Religion in EQ: a starting point</b>
<br><br>
All these excellent questions revolve around the question of religion, role-playing and EverQuest. They address an issue that I love to talk about, so look out!  I may go on for a while.
<br><br>
When creating a character, your race/class combination determines which gods you will worship.  Once you have decided on your race/class, then you will be given a list of appropriate gods to choose from, which varies in number and kind, and occasionally includes the choice of "agnostic".  Clerics, Druids, Shamans, Rangers, Paladins, and Shadowknights never can choose to be agnostic, since those classes are dependent on gods for their powers and identity.
<br><br>
Your choices are what I'd call "race appropriate".  You won't find a troll worshipping the goddess of love, nor will you find a high elf worshipping Innoruuk.  I think that this is fine, since it guides characters into religious choices that reflect their racial heritage and culture.  It allows for the racial antipathies that are part of the game to be given a religious basis as well. 
<br><br>
Your choice of religion also affects your standing within the faction system.  Be aware that the choice of an evil, nasty god such as the PlagueBringer will not endear you to certain factions.  The faction system controls things such as the tendency for an NPC to help you, sell to you, or even to attack you, so when you choose a religion, you should be sure to choose one that fits the character and the style in which you wish to play them.  Entering the complex web of faction relationships is an important part of playing EverQuest.  See Wynn's <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue56/expressions.htm">Expressions</a> on the Faction system for more information about it.
<br><br>
Once your character has made the choice of religion, how can you affect your standing with your god?  Completing quests given by your church or in the best interests of your religion will help your standing, as will fighting the enemies of your chosen god.  You, of course, could choose to negatively affect your standing with that god by doing things that act in opposition to the god's beliefs, or doing something so idiotic as to slay a priest of your church.  Grouping with players does not affect your faction standings, but if, in that group, you do things which create faction difficulties you will find yourself in hot water.  Healing or aiding a PC who worships a god antipathetic to yours doesn't, to my knowledge affect your faction standings.
<br><br>
What's so horrible about getting in bad with your god?  If you are a member of the god-dependent classes, it can be devastating.  You won't be able to buy new spells or train at your church, since they will at first begin to not like you and sell at higher prices, and eventually kill you on sight if you continue your evil ways.   For the non-dependent classes, it is no worse than any other faction hit, but that can get pretty bad at times.  I had a friend who repeatedly killed an NPC because he was worth nice experience for his level of difficulty, only to find that that NPC was a good friend of the guards in the nearest town.  It's ugly when your hometown soldiers kill you on sight.
<br><br>
Getting in good with your god, as far as I know now, only affects your faction standings.  I would imagine, however, than someone with an extremely high faction standing in his god's eyes would have to have something nice happen to him.
<br><br>
There is more to be written about religion, but this hopefully covers some basics that can be more fully addressed at a later date.  Thanks for your excellent questions!
<br><br>
Perhaps I'll write an article…
