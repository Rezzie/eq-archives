My name is Srella.  Srella the Enchantress of Ale.  I consider myself to be quite cheerful for a dark elf, and at the weekly sacrifices to Innoruuk I am often the only one smiling.  Some think I smile because I like the blood, and while that is true to a degree I really smile just to be friendly.
<br><br>
I'll admit, I'm not the best enchantress in Norrath.  In fact, I'm not even a full-time enchantress.  My real job is as a barmaid at the Blind Fish, a large tavern in Neriak Commons.  It's usually very quiet.  The regulars play darts or look out of our windows into the underground river.  Sometimes there are fish to watch, and lately a Leatherfoot Deputy has trapped himself there.  It's good laugh to watch him swim about franticly, looking for a way out.  My boss insists that we not tap the glass.
<br><br>
A few nights ago, something exceedingly strange happened.  A young dark elf that looked to be a necromancer entered.  I didn't notice him immediately as I was downstairs cleaning tables, but I soon heard him.  He ran around saying "Hail!" to every person in the tavern.  All of them looked at him strangely and said nothing.  Eventually he came to me, but he didn't hail me.  Instead he said, "Finally, a real person.  Can you help me?"
<br><br>
Obviously, I was a little confused.  Why did he call me a "real person?"  I didn't let it bother me, though.  Norrath is home to some strange folk.  Dodging griffins all the time isn't good for the sanity of travelers.  So I just said, "Sure, what can I get for you?"
<br><br>
Now he looked to be confused.  "Get?  You can't get anything for me.  I was just hoping that you could tell me how to beat the pick-axe quest."
<br><br>
"Beat?" I asked.  "How do you 'beat' a quest?  I've heard of people going on quests, and even succeeding in them, but never 'beating' them."
<br><br>
He looked bored.  "Yah, yah, I get it.  Could you just tell me?"
<br><br>
"I'm afraid I can't, sir.  I'm not the questing type."
<br><br>
"Fine.  Thanks for nothing."  He stomped out of the tavern, leaving me quite confused.
<br><br>
Not a minute had passed when a second young necromancer came through the door.  He bought a few drinks and then turned to me.  "Isn't it cool that you can get drunk?  I can't believe they put that in this game."
<br><br>
While he was downing ale after ale I just had to say, "Of course you can get drunk… And if you think drinking is a game I daresay you do too much of it."  The bartender looked at me disapprovingly, but I know that secretly he thought it was funny.
<br><br>
The necromancer looked at me strangely, but said, "Yeah, I guess you're right.  I should save my money to buy more spells.  Hey, what level are you?"
<br><br>
I don't have to tell you that I clearly thought the man to be drunk, spouting nonsense as he was.  "Level, good sir?  I'm quite sure I have no idea what you are talking about."
<br><br>
He looked at me strangely, and then said, "Whatever, I just did a /who on you and it says yer a level 6 enchanter.  I'm a level 7 necromancer.  Wanna kill some stuff together?  Maybe we could level you."
<br><br>
Now I may worship the God of Hate, but I am quite sensitive about the environment.  Nektulos Forest is filled to the bursting point with poachers, and I make a point to only kill what I have to.  "Good sir!  I do not go about randomly killing things!  Why you are almost as barbaric as those unthinking ogres!"  I was quite miffed, and I didn't even think to ask what he meant by 'leveling' me.  If I had, I probably would have thought he was coming on to me.
<br><br>
"I don't have time for this," he said as he staggered out of the tavern.  I regained my composure and returned to cleaning the tables.  After a few minutes, a troll opened the tavern door and literally crawled in.  I rolled my eyes and asked him if I could get anything for him.
<br><br>
"How'd you do that?" he asked me.
<br><br>
"Do what?"
<br><br>
"You rolled your eyes."
<br><br>
"Yeah, and?"
<br><br>
"How'd you do it?"
<br><br>
My day was not getting any better.  I mean come on, I know trolls are stupid, but really.  I rolled my eyes again.
<br><br>
"You did it again!"
<br><br>
"Really?  I hadn't noticed."  At this moment, the second necromancer walked into the tavern.
<br><br>
"Sorry," he said, "I hadn't realized you were role-playing."
<br><br>
"Role-whating?" I asked.
<br><br>
The troll turned to the necromancer.  "Maybe you can tell me.  How do you roll your eyes?"
<br><br>
"What?"  The necromancer sounded as confused as I felt.
<br><br>
The troll turned to me.  "Show him, roll your eyes again."  I looked at him with hate gleaming in my eyes.  "There!" he said, "She just looked at me with hate gleaming in her eyes!  How do you do that?"
<br><br>
"Oh, emotes," The necromancer said.  "Just type /em before you do something."  At this the troll started to do quite random things.  First he smiled, then he laughed, then he jumped up and down, and then he picked his teeth.  While he was doing all this, the necromancer insisted on starting a conversation with me.  "Let me try out this role-playing thing," he started.  "Hark hark, good lady!  How are you this fine day?"
<br><br>
Innoruuk was obviously punishing me for something.  "Sir, firstly I have already greeted you, and secondly it's nine-o'-clock at night!"  The troll burst into tears, and then ran over and started to tap the glass.  "Don't do that!" I yelled.
<br><br>
"Do what?" the necromancer asked me.
<br><br>
"Not you, the troll!  Quit tapping the glass!"
<br><br>
"Geez, calm down," the troll said, "I'm just trying this emote thing out."  Just at that moment, a shadow knight walked in.
<br><br>
For a moment, there was silence.  Even the brashest of trolls knows better than to anger a shadow knight.  Then, the shadow knight spoke.
<br><br>
"DaMn," he said, "ThIS GAmE ROkZ!"
<br><br>
"Dude!" the necromancer said, "Shut up, we're trying to role-play here!"
<br><br>
The troll started to play darts.
<br><br>
The shadow knight retorted "ScrEw yOu, i JuST WaNT sOMe BoOZe!"
<br><br>
I hid in a corner.  I thought I was going crazy.  After all, it was more likely that I was the one going mad rather than the rest of the world.  After a few minutes though, everything quieted down.  I peeked up, and everything seemed to be back to normal.  All three intruders were gone.
<br><br>
I walked around in blissful silence for a few seconds, thankful that it was over.  I picked up my rag and went back to cleaning.
<br><br>
Then, they were back.  I started to cry.
<br><br>
"Wow," said the necromancer, "Sure is bad packet loss tonight."
<br><br>
"I kNow," the shadow knight returned, "ThIS gAMe SuKZ!"
<br><br>
The troll farted.
<br><br>
I screamed.
