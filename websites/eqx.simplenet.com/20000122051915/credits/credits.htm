<p>We are very proud of our staff here at EQX.  Without them this could not be done, nor done so well.
<br><br>
<p>So without further delay, here they are (in alphabetical order).</p>

<p align="justify">I’ve been a "gamer" since high school, and that was a while ago (ok, I’m 33 years old, stop pestering me already!).  My favorite role playing games are Rune Quest (in it’s old form, not the new one by AH), Vampire: The Masquerade, and, of course, Dungeons and Dragons.  I have not been involved in any MUDs and I may be the only person you know that has not played UO.  I did beta test Tanarus for five or so months (see team Phenomena for more details).  I have lived in Southern California my whole life.  That makes interacting with folks via the Internet so much fun.  I am a Computer Specialist by profession.  I have burned my first novel, it was the worst piece of trash ever written.

<b><a href="mailto:spleen@mb.sympatico.ca">Aklar</a>:</b>
<br><br>
As the newest member of the EQX team and a latecomer to the gaming scene, EverQuest was, in fact, my first RPG experience.  But don't hate me, I am one of you now.  What I am <em>not</em>, is a man.  I am not a man!  Why do people always think I am a man?  Is "Aklar" really that masculine?  It's just a transposition of the letters in my real name. (Put your thinking caps on, people.  Who can Name That Author?)  I'm going to write gooey romantic stories, where the heroine faints every three minutes, and then we'll see how many people call me "sir".
<br><br>
Ahem. Other than that, I live in Canada, I love Terry Prachett's Discworld series, I have a significant other who doubles as my editor, I am a theatre student, and, yes, to all those who asked, I am considering the possibility of a full-length novel.  The prospect is more daunting than soloing Lord Nagafen, though, so don't expect to see it on the shelves of a book store near you anytime soon.
<br><br>
Oh, and I am not a man.
<br><br>
Dammit.

<br><br>
Hi Kids, I'm Archanalia.  You know me from such hit websites as "Pamela
Anderson Counts to two" and the "Scratch and Sniff Homepage:  Special
Flatulence Edition".  But I'm here today to talk to you about the dangers of
reading biographies on the net.  It's all fine and good until you put an eye
out, then you'd feel really bad, wouldn't you.  So remember to stand far
back from the screen, or better yet, have a friend read it.  If you can
still see this, it's been a pleasure talking to you.
<br><br>
Nah.  Try this one:
<br><br>
Archanalia, aka FooFighter, aka Hey You, aka Bad Speeller; known to frequent
Inns and Taverns of norrath, pawning his merchandise to the public.  He owns
a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Maze/5775">workshop</a> not
far from the Shallow Soul Tavern and Inn, where he creates all manner of
virtual graphics for web use by common folks such as yourself ;-)

<b><a href="mailto:chance24@earthlink.net">Elaan</a>:</b>
<br><br>
I am 25 years of age and have spent most of them gaming in all sorts of
genres.  I have owned every platform system beginning with Pong and
ending with the last one to be released, the N64. Recently I returned to
computer gaming after a long hiatus and have fallen in love with online
games, mostly RPG's. My love for RPG's comes from years of pen and paper
games, my favorite being Paladium Role Playing. My career is that of the
starving artist, writer by trade, but unemployed in that field. I am
currently writing a manga style comic book for a local artist and
publisher, working on film scripts, and constantly churning out poetry.
My other hobbies are cinema, music, computers and art in general. My
ideal job would either be writing for a gaming magazine or directing
films. EQ Express is my first forum for publishing my work on the net,
and am very glad to be a part of this team.

<br><br>
Ian Ash is a music lover, amateur artist, occasional writer and father
of two. Online if he is not busy carving out html for his employer or rambling
on for EverQuest Express, he is reading the news groups or chatting in
IRC. He has always taken a favor to warriors over mages in RPGs for some
reason, and plans on playing a few in EQ...

<b><a href="mailto:kjones@enol.com">Keafa</a></b>
<br><br>
Keafa is the mother of two and wife to Ian Ash.  She has been  role playing AD&D and MURPS for almost
10 years now.  She also enjoys nature and would prefer to be in the mountains camping rather than on the
Internet due to the natural druid with in her.  She became interested in online computer games after
fighting the computer for Ian's attention.  One day she sat down to see what could possibly be so
interesting and never got back up <g>.  She has decided to join the EQX staff after attending some
of their staff  meetings with her husband and realized they needed a woman around to keep the boys
inline :-).

<b><a href="mailto:oghma@bv.net">Oghma</a>:</b>
<br><br>
I started playing RPG's in 1978, playing D&D from the original 3-book
boxed set with the Greyhawk Adventures supplement (which introduced theives
to D&D).  When Dragon magazine published the hit chart tables for AD&D, I
switched to that.  I played AD&D, Traveller, Space Opera, and other RPG's,
but switched to GURPS after the 3rd edition, since I liked the way they did
magic.	About this time (1989) I started playing on RealmsMUD, before it closed
and re-opened.  I became a god on some other muds, and since then I have
played onvarious MUDS since then on and off.  I have played UO since the Charter edition came out.

<b><a href="mailto:razor@razors-edge.net">Razor</a>:</b>
<br><br>
Razor is a married, 31 yr. old (stress on the old) father of (3)
teenagers.   I'm a network analyst that has been playing with computers
all my life.  I work for a fortune 400 company designing networks.  I
have my own switched, fast Ethernet network at home with over (7)
computers, (1) computer for each person, a mail server, a firewall, and
a big fat pipe to the Internet!  What a bunch of geeks huh??
I have always loved playing online multi-player RPG’s.  I started
playing MUD’s and sorta evolved from there.  I also love to play D&D.  I
have played for about 11 years now.  I also enjoy playing Magic (the
card game).  I’m an amateur body builder with over 7 years under my belt
(so I’m a BIG geek).

<b><a href="mailto:thalerj@wwa.com">Wynn Orill</a>:</b>
<br><br>
I am a 25 year old software engineer who comes from a family of 11 and is
now married to a non-geek.  I was introduced to RPGs by playing AD&D when
I was not even a teenager yet.  My oldest brother was the GM, and I created
a thief as my first character.  I was also introduced to computers at a young
age, also thanks to my brother.  I began playing MUDs on a Commodore 64 with
a 300 baud modem, and have since played several MUDs, including Hero, Igor,
and Bat.  I have also done development on some of these MUDs, usually creating
areas and quests that stray from the norm.  I enjoy creating games within the
game, such as Dragon Jousting and Grid Wars, which are played on the MUD.
It has been a long time since I've played pen and paper games, but I am still
active in the online gaming scene.
