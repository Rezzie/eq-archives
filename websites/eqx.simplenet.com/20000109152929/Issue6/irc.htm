<big><big>F</big></big>irst of all the basics.  IRC stands for Inter Relay Chat, it allows people to enter chat rooms, and chat with other people in a text based environment.  If you are new to IRC, I suggest you find a programme called MIRC, it is user-friendly and free.<br><br>
The first EverQuest IRC channel was created by Dach around the period of July/August 1997, it was on EFNet and was called #everquest.  Xethusael became an op (channel operator: someone with the ability to kick abusive people out of the channel) soon after, but to the best of my knowledge has always been rather silent.  Dach single-handedly kept the channel alive for the first few months mostly through just being there.  You could log on at any time during the afternoon or evening and chances were that you would find him on the chat channel.  Dach had 3 bots (computer controlled channel operators) guarding the channel, though they were needed only once when someone called Poor tried to take over the channel.  I made my presence increasingly known over the months, Dach made me an op, and we kept the channel highly active and newbie friendly.

Then came the fateful day.  Dach’s bots had developed a fault and hadn’t been working for a couple of days, and suddenly we found the channel locked out, and no-one was able to get in for a couple of days.  A new channel #equest was hastily organised and the EverQuest regulars started to meet there instead.  After a couple of days the channel became accessible again.  However, everyone was rather shocked to find a huge list of ops that no-one had heard of before, none of them had spent any time in the EverQuest chat channel nor had they ever posted anything to the newsgroup.  It subsequently turned out that they had all moved from an Ultima channel, for the sake of peace and because I don’t want a new flame war to spring up on the newsgroup I shall not publicly express my personal opinion on the incident.

Understandably put-out by the incident the EverQuest regulars set about trying to organise a solution, although Dach was rather laid back about the whole matter, saying that he had better things to do than worry about who had ops.  Saturnino set up a new channel on DALNet, but he had not been around long enough to be recognised as an EverQuest ‘authority’ figure, and in addition people were rather unwilling to move away from the EFNet server, so the channel failed soon after.  I set-up a channel called #equest, and this became the channel for the EverQuest regulars to meet and chat.  As to the #everquest channel, it became an IRC graveyard, with large numbers of people sitting there without a word being spoken for hours on end.  The active chatters that normally kept people involved and the conversation going had moved to the smaller more lively #equest channel, and the new band of ops knew very little about EverQuest and so had little to talk about.  Brad talked to the relevant parties in order to restore peace, and Dach and Xeth were given ops on the #everquest channel, although it remained a graveyard.
