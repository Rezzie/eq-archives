It seems funny to me that the latest rage for EverQuest discussion is last names.  It made me chuckle the first time a saw so many people worried about not being able to use the last name that they have always used for their characters.  Then I laughed out loud when it continued to be an issue.  Not just 'an' issue, but 'the' issue.  Well, I guess I've stopped laughing.  You're gonna make me cry, if you keep it up…
<br><br>
So I'm gonna talk about the one other idea that I've seen bandied about, player GMs.  Now this is an interesting topic, and one that lends to a lot other topics, all of them interesting.
<br><br>
I am very much in favor of player GMs.  I think that there will never be enough employees at 989 Studios to give me the game world that I want to play in.  I want a world where the rulers of the Ogre nation are overtly trying to destroy the Humans, while subtly trying to weaken the Trolls for their eventual destruction.  I want a world where I can discover a lost child in the heart of Qeynos and spend days trying to get her home.  Days in which I encounter NPCs that are not just prompted to answer me based on key words, and where the parents that I seek might just avoid me because they know their child is cursed.  I want a world that I can interact with, not just play in.  And while I trust the creators of EverQuest to create state of the art NPC AI, I don't expect miracles.
<br><br>
I know that many of you hear the word GM and think of Ultima Online.  You remember experiences you had with a GM that treated you unfairly (or didn't treat you at all).  Or you remember hearing tales of GM cheating.  And it may have soured you on the idea of players as GMs.  And I can see your point.  But I think that there are ways to implement player GMs and still maintain a level of fair play for all.  Firstly, player GMs would have limited abilities.  Perhaps adding a few levels of status for GMs will allow a testing period before anyone gets any real ability to mess things up.  Example:
<br><br>
<b>Guide:</b>  Any player GM wanna-be must first act as a guide.  A guide has no special powers at all, he plays on a standard client.  His job is to help out new players.  He is to teach them the 'how's of the game.  He is also to teach some of the etiquette of the game.  A player would have to be recognized as a good Guide before being considered for the next level.  He must be nominated for the next level by one 989 GM and seconded by one other GM.  He would then undergo (without his knowledge) a period of testing, where GMs of higher rank will be asked to make new characters and check on the Guides skills and willingness to help.  After five reviews are sent in, four must recommend the Guide for the next level.  At this point the Guide is notified that, if he wishes, he can become an Assistant.
<br><br>
<b>Assistant:</b>  This player will be an aid to the plots and quests of Norrath.  He will be an NPC in quests, given only the information that he needs to play the character.  He will be asked to continue helping new players at other times.  It is Assistants that should make up the majority of player GMs.  They will have access to a special suggestion/reporting form that will allow them to give status on their current NPC role (I have given the golden key to a guy named Rigo.  I have had three others ask for it, I told them that another had taken it, but as the need was great they should help him if they can…) and make suggestions about future spin offs on the current quest.  Due to the large number of Assistants they will be asked not to suggest new quests, those can only be generated at a higher level.  Note that these Assistants will never have a character with a title that shows that they are Assistants.  Only by agreement of all active 989 GMs can a player advance beyond this status.
<br><br>
<b>GM:</b>  A player GM will be responsible for running minor quests, any major quest will be handled by 989 GMs.  Player GMs will have the ability to create NPCs needed for quests, either by generating regular NPCs (probably would have to be copies of others that already exist with modified appearances and names) or by modifying a PC to meet the needs of the quest in order that the player may act as an NPC, including modifying equipment, levels and appearance.  GMs would be allowed to make suggestions to the 989 staff about new quests and world events.  Perhaps each one would be responsible for a crew of Assistants.  A player GM would, just like the Assistant, never have a title attached to his name indicating that he is a GM.
<br><br>
Or something like that.  I'm a bit vague on the powers that a player GM should have, not because I want to be restrictive, but because I don't really know what powers they could have.  Basically they would be responsible for helping new players with the game and setting up and organizing quests and events.  Only 989 GMs would have the powers and responsibility for helping players with bug issues, other problem players, or any other complaints.  Basically administration and over all plot would be up to 989 Studios and quests and roleplaying opportunities would be up to player GMs.  And the number of player GMs could be kept very small this way, probably only five or six per server.
<br><br>
I'm not interested in having players have much at all to do with policing the game, though certainly the role of the player GM could be increased to handle that if there is a need.  Limiting the numbers of players with actual powers would reduce the amount of abuse.  But having enough to drive in game scenarios (you all remember the best excuse for the random PK in UO - nothing better to do) is a key to the success of EverQuest.  I would actually prefer that 989 Studios were to hire 5 or 6 people to be 'plot' GMs on each server, but I don't see that as likely.  And players can do the job.
<br><br>
Of course all of this assumes that 989 wants the kinds of subtle and interesting quests and plot twists in the game that I do.  I mean sure, have someone carry an important not from Qeynos to Freeport for a few gold.  Nothing complicated there.  But heck, one time in ten have the prince that they are supposed to give the note to be gone.  Have the King force the PCs to find him.  Let them save him from his kidnappers.  Or, if they fail, have his death mean something to the world.  Allow quests to have a dynamic affect on the game.  I would love to see each world of Norrath develop a completely different history as we play.
<br><br>
But it's also important that quests be generated with the whole in mind.  Perhaps the Troll nation moves against RiverDale.  Let's have something more subtle than a horde of Trolls appearing outside the gates.  Let's have a Halfling merchant come to town, chased by a dozen Trolls.  Let's see if the PCs near town help him and save him, gaining a little information from him.  Let's allow that if RiverDale has obviously become aware of the plot, that the Trolls change it.  They instead send in someone to kill of the mayor of RiverDale.  Of course those assassins could be PCs.
<br><br>
All that can't happen without close GM attention.  And it will never happen if the 989 folks are too busy answering bug problems.  But player GMs could handle the little stuff, gathering the assassins, playing the Halfling merchant, of even being in the crowd near Freeport, urging folks to help him save the merchant from the Trolls.
<br><br>
I would hate for this to be an area where EverQuest took Ultima Onlines failure and learned the wrong lesson from it.
