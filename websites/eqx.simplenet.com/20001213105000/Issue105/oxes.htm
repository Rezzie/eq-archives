<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
I was out on commen adventuring and arrived in someplace i never been before, not sure what the place is called but was almost instantly charged by a kodiak bear - Strangly it ran right paste me and right behind it came a pack of orcish creatures fleeing in panic.  Now further in i found this strange little creatur called Murf Blacks, 'was smaller than a Gnome and all black except for his white hat and shoes.   Anyways, he was tromping about very agry like and i even saw a giant turn tale and run in the other direction, as the little fellow shouted "who stole me sword!?" and sometimes "Don't make me call out me barbarian friend". Well i was figuring this had to be a quest npc, maybe even for a barbarian/warrior only sword, so i thought you might be able to help me solve this puzzle. Have you ever hear of a Murf Blacks?

Dear Eiqea,
<br><br>
Ahh!  Ya's founded da not-so-seen-very-much-at-all Murf Black!  Ayeps I's meted dis creature a few months back.  Was in some serious nasty bashy.  I mean da blood and guts were flyin EVERYWHERE and der was bodies bout, err, welpers a couple o long strides all around me not count'n da witty bitty pieces dat flew far off.  And da Holy was even have'n ta git hit a lil bit cause I's was be'n smacked around so bad.  I was tell'n da Holy what good bashy dis was, and Holy was agree'n cause we were in da hands o da Tribunal at dis point.  Holy was tryin ta use da last o da medicine on me and dat made da turkey go fer him again.  Welpers I's tell ya's, I was a tryin ta taunt like crazy.  Not even yell'n at da Turkey, "Yer mommy was a gnoll wiff backwards knees!" was a workin.  When suddenly it squaked-gobbled and died.  Holy was a look'n at me and I was look'n at da Holy and we were look'n at each other try'n ta figure out what happened.  But Holy din say anything so I's goes, "Dat new medicine?  I's likes it!"  And Holy said, "Dat, Bashy, was da hand o da Tribunal"  and I start ta go "Ohhhhh!" when we both heared a muffled sound.  I tolded da Holy it wasn't really deaded yet, and Holy tolded me ta stay back.  He used da purrty staff and half flipped and threw it away from us.
<br><br>
Guess what was undernearth!  Murf Black!  He was a mess, da Turkey guts had gotted all over him and I tolded da lil dolly like thingy he looked like a real bashy all messed up like dat.  Murf Black also tolded us bout loose'n his sword, but I's thunkered it was a joke.  I mean, who'd bashy wiff a wooden sword?  Yer never gonna git the blood and guts flyin dat way.  I tolded him dis to, dat maybe he should looky fer a better sword.  Break'n toes was da best he was gonna do wiff dat sword he's look'n fer instead o big huge gouges and stuff.  Well, big fer him anyways.

<em> Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
I had a curious question. In my widespread exploits across the lands of Norrath, I once passed through the frozen city of Halas. I noticed that although it certainly contains a curious collection of culture, the weather tends to scare most travellers away, leaving the city primarily populated by Barbarians alone. I was thinking that perhaps the high shamen and ruling council of Halas should consider a PR campaign to try and attract those lucrative tourism dollars. Perhaps a slogan like "Halas- After a few pints of Blackburrow Stout, you won't even FEEL the cold!" or "Halas- Nothing warms the soul like a few dead goblins on your Zweihander." I think it could attract more visitors to your lovely city. What do you think?
<br><br>
Eagerly awaiting your response,

Dear Famien,
<br><br>
Iffen I had ta make up a catchy thingy o words I'd thinky I'd like: "Drinky at da Halas' McDaniels, our slams stuns ya's till da morn."
<br><br>
However, ya's make me wonder, so I's gots ta ask.  Why we wants more people a comin visit'n ta da Halas?  I's mean, already da Holy's gots a thingy before em to redo da steps in da pit o doom.  Seems some halfling went down in der and wiffout a Shaman or a Druid, couldn't jump high enough ta git out again.  Couple o barb-cubs playin at being a warrior founded him all outta food and drinky and almost deaded.  Da Rivervale is protestin ta da Holys somethin awful over it, seems he was an important personages cub or somethin.  Den!  der was dis Snotty-man Finger Wiggler type up der fer some party.  And he done raised a huge fuss at da McDaniels cause he had ta stand da whole time.  Some o da tribe dat was der tolded me iffen he sated down dat he looked, well, very un-important-Snotty-Man-Finger-Wiggler-type and more like a dolly in da Mom's or Pa's chair which was causing some o the tribe ta snicker.  O course he's starts a carry'n on how he's gonna blast all da chairs cause they don't worky and someone went and got a Holy.  Da Holy's are standin der, den sittin, den standin again and say "Da chairs work jist fine".  Which any barb in der right mind could see and dat was a big waste o a Holy's time who could o been workin on da medinice majik's and such.
<br><br>
Ayeps, perhaps I jist dunt git it, which da Flooter Tooter tells me sometimes.  O course Holy says "Tooty jist take'n dat last thwap'n out on ya's Bashy, not yer fault he sings songs da monsters jist hate".  And then Flooter Tooter yells ta "Listen ere ya's Barbs da name is not TOOTY and NOT Flooter Tooter!"  And Holy and I will stop a run'n, looky at each other, den Holy shrugs and says "whatever Tooty".  So I dunt feel ta bad cause Holy sometimes dunt git it either I dunt think, even though he's a leader in da tribe and can works da medicine.

Dear lil un,
<br><br>
Well, dis can be da tricky thingy o it all.  Now follows me closely on dis.
<br><br>
It depends.  Ayeps, it depends.  Iffen yer in really safe bashy and pracitin and stuff, put da practice one in yer main hand cause it swings more often.  Iffen yer in tough bashy den ya's want to have da pracitce one in da off hand cause ya's might git deaded not a hitt'n so often.  Also, what ya's fightin?  Iffen yer fightin finger wiggler types ya's want da fastest in yer main hand cause it really messes em up ta git all bloody and stuff.  Iffen not in tough bashy, face'n a finger wiggler, or practice'n it dunt matter so much.
<br><br>
And I'll tell ya's, I dunt drinky to much.  Dunt really like a tast'n watered bread and da lil un wine makes me head hurted.
