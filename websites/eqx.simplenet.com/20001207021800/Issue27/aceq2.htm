From Jason Booth, Lead Technical Artist for Asheron's Call:
<br><br>
Although I normaly don't post or email EQ sites, I feel I must when they are
publishing mis-information about Asheron's Call. In your AC vs. EQ article,
several things are misrepresented, or completely wrong.

Graphics section:
<br><br>
While graphics are stricly subjective, please keep in mind that what you are
being publicly show of AC is being rendered completely in software.  Until EQ
releases some software screenshots (which they don't support) or we release
some hardware accelorated shows (yes, we are working on it, and it looks
amazing), any comparisons are pretty useless. Also keep in note that we are
able to stream new environments to the user at run time, and our world is
continuous, something you won't find in any other game I know of. There is
no "level loading", or "please wait while downloading new areas" in AC.

<em>Asheron's Call requires manual aiming and manual clicking to attack. You
hold down the mouse button and let the power bar reach the max.  Meanwhile,
you move your cursor over your target, and it has arrows telling you if you
are too low, too high, or whatever. When you release the button, you attack.
I think this system will have to be scrapped when they realize a little lag
will destroy the whole thing. If it is lenient and lets the client report
whether it was a hit or miss, they will find Diablo-like cheaters taking
over.</em>
