...I would prefer less fiction and more features, articles and editorials.

Nothing wrong with fiction, just seems like you have way too much of it to
fit your "newsletter" format.
<br><br>
You guys need articles submitted?  I'll be glad to pen some.

<em>[Ed: Please do!  Send us whatever great articles you have!  This goes for
anyone.  If it's interesting and well written, there's a good chance it will
end up on this site.  But I have to tell you, I love the fiction.  I don't
want the number of stories to be reduced at all.  I will accept it, however,
if the number of articles goes up : )]</em>
