Well, it's good to be back.  I took a few weeks off EverQuest, due to family guests and a nagging cold that has been hanging around for a few weeks, and boy, it was nice to not have to eat, sleep, and think EverQuest for a little while.
<br><br>
Who am I kidding?  I still ate, slept, and thought EQ, just had a couple of days go by that I didn't write about it.
<br><br>
Wynn's interview questions got me thinking, so I wanted to just bring up one thing that has been kicking around in my head since he asked it:
<br><br>
<em><b>Wynn:</b> How do you find the time to write such well-researched and in-depth articles for both EverQuest Express and EQVault?</em>
<br><br>
I am a library director.  I come to work every day and have people ask me for information.  I don't really like using that word, though - "information".  "Information" is too nebulous, too vague, and doesn't indicate what the individual asking really needs, or how important it is to them.  Information, to a single parent coping with child custody, is the legal steps needed to keep an abusive spouse away from a child.  To a migrant worker who commutes to work 100-200 miles in a beat up old Chevy Nova, information is a "How to repair a carburetor" book which lets him keep that old car running, since he can't afford a mechanic.  To a lonely person, who is kind of shy, it's a stack of romance novels that takes them to a world where they are bold and sexy.  "Information", I believe, is better expressed as knowledge.  Knowledge is what is <b>needed</b>, that specific piece of that great cultural ocean that is our heritage which will help that specific individual.
<br><br>
One of the great cultural events of the 80's and 90's is of course, Internet.  In his book, "Friday", Robert Heinlein wrote about a database which allowed you to read about something, then quickly link to a video on that topic, then read about a character in that movie, and be able to intuitively follow your curiosity.  He wrote that in 1982, and not long after that the first web-browser made it's tiny steps in that direction.  Knowledge is now available to anyone who has Internet access.
<br><br>
Funny thing though - libraries still are the best place to find knowledge.  Libraries are not about "just books" - although saying that implies that books have lost their use, which they haven't.  Much of the knowledge available on Internet is poorly updated, indexed, or organized.  Some web sites are absolutely astounding resources, and some are time-wasters that give you hope on the first page, and then clunky search scripts or poor organization make you take hours to find something.  Information in books is still the best place to go for some things, since those book publishers have discovered the best format for that type of information over years of research and feedback.
<br><br>
What libraries <b>are</b> about, though is the same thing they have been doing since that first giant library in Alexandria.  They are the interface between knowledge and you, and they are always trying to do that job better. Libraries don't discriminate against format - whether the information is best available in a book, or on the net, they will find it in the format that suits you best.  Most librarians spend their entire lives finding information for others, and are very skilled knowledge detectives.
<br><br>
When I went to library school, I studied the organization of knowledge, and how to give better access to it.  I didn't really realize what exactly I had learned until I had a friend ask me for some help with an assignment.  Within five minutes I had given her a blueprint for research, complete with books, journal articles, and a video.  All she had to do was read the material and write the paper.  This was not just a random list of sources, either, it was all pertinent and useful.  Later she said that every source that I had identified had been used, and that when she looked further, other sources referred her to the sources I had found.  So <b>that's</b> what I went to school for! :)
<br><br>
Internet is not the death of libraries, merely a fantastic opportunity to do our jobs better.  Many of you are students, and I urge you to go to your library, and ask the librarians for help finding information.  You will be astounded at how easy your assignments become.
<br><br>
I love my job. :)
