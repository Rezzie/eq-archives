"You need to prepare, my young squire." The elder looked at his student, knowing his full potential, but also knowing he was not prepared for the great and dangerous world of Norrath.
<br><br>
"I need to get out and see the world, Tallor. I have been locked up in the city for too long. The stale air of Kaladim chokes me now. The only way I shall truly learn is to actually get some experience on the field of battle. This is a cave, made for training young ones. I am not a young one anymore. My training needs to head to the outside world."
<br><br>
"And if you do get out there, what then? You have no where to go." Tallor was trying to get young Kaldaur to see his point.
<br><br>
"You're right. I will never have anywhere to go unless I find somewhere to travel. I am tired of traveling through the city gates and walls. There is no action, no adventure in this city, nothing more than running errands for the king and preparing the evening supper of the warriors. When shall I become a member of that table? Certainly not when I am Kaldaur, the great dining room warrior!" He threw his arms up in the air as a sign of emphasis.
<br><br>
Tallor smiled faintly. "You are not the first great warrior to want to end their training so quickly. Thagros Ogrebane, Dorin Grudgehammer, and Frokik the Troll Slayer are some of the other squires I taught who wanted to get out into the world of Norrath. But in the end they saw my wisdom and finished they're training and when they went out into the treacherous above ground, they were prepared. You are not. Finish your training now, so that we may make you a fine warrior in the likes of Frokik. They would be proud to see you make this decision as they had."
<br><br>
Now faced with the task of going in his hero's footsteps, Kaldaur considered this new point. If they had enough stamina to last in this forsaken cave, then so would he. "As you wish, master." He bowed deeply in traditional Dwarven salute to their elders. He turned and walked with his head up towards the city barracks.
<br><br>
Tallor watched his pupil leave the training pit, and sighed. They had been having this discussion for the last week, and Kaldaur was getting more and more anxious to leave Kaladim. Luckily Tallor had been able to come up with the point that some of Kaladim's greatest heroes had also been as anxious, but they in turn had chosen to finish the training so that they may be the best warriors possible. Kaldaur would respond to this, unlike his other pleadings that had gone unhindered by his student in Kaldaur's inner and outer quest for glory in the name of Kaladim.
<br><br>
He would talk to the King about this. Everyone related to the warrior caste had been following up on Kaldaur's progress. Many shared his views that he would be the next great hero in Kaladim's history of greatness. Now, though, he had other matters to attend to.
<br><br>
Kaldaur groaned when he entered his cabin. It was not fair. He wanted, needed, to get out and fight for his people. He could do no good in this conflict with the ogres and trolls training meticulously in every kind of combat that he might never even use. He liked one handed weapons, and he felt no need to train in the art of blunt weapons. Who in their right mind would use a blunt weapon anyway? Better to cut your enemy to pieces than to give them a headache and a bump. 
<br><br>
He growled at the unfairness of it all. As his anger grew, he felt the need to hit something. It grew stronger and stronger until he could not contain himself any longer. He lashed out at the wall with as much force as possible, smashing his bare hand into the iron wall. He now let out a groan of pain. He hand was throbbing, but the wall didn't even seem to care or notice. This way the way the day usually went. His impatience was hard to contain, and he needed someone to take it out on, not an object that could not feel any pain. He needed a troll in front of him to bash in and then he would feel much better. A wall was not the ideal opponent. 
<br><br>
Oh well, he thought. He had lasted here for three years, and he only had one more until he could feel and hear the cries and calls to battle. But not until graduation from the Academy. He knew what people expected of him, how people always thought he would be the next great warrior. He also knew Tallor, probably his greatest friend, also shared these views. If it were not for him, he would not care about what other people thought. But Tallor had taken him in when the Ogres came, and Tallor was the only reason Kaldaur was still alive, instead of hanging as a war trophy on an ogre wall. He had been five at the time, and the ogres had almost slaughtered him until Tallor took the blow directed for the toddler and slew the ogre trying to take the life of Kaldaur. For that Kaldaur owed his mentor his life, and he would never forget that. Even though Tallor could be a pain at times, he respected him a great deal. If Tallor wanted him to stay in the city for another year to finalize and home his skills even further, then Kaldaur would stay, even though his calling inside was about ready to burst out of his skin and jump at the nearest opponent. 
<br><br>
He needed something to do until dinner. Kaldaur then remembered he had a job to perform. Tallor had asked him to take some supplies out to the guards. Hastily he gathered up the assorted items and opened the door to his cabin. Walking out and carefully shutting it behind him, he walked briskly down the long corridor, heading past the training pit, going past the spear shop, and heading outside of the second gate of Kaladim. He turned three corners and then there he was, outside, breathing the fresh air of Norrath. The sun was shining this day, and he had forgotten how beautiful the upper world could be at times. He spotted the two guards standing at their posts, talking casually to each other. There must have not been much action as of late, because they were very laid back.
<br><br>
"Hello Haendor. How are you this find day?"
<br><br>
The first guard turned his attention to Kaldaur, and smiled broadly. "Hi Kal! I am fine today. And you?"
<br><br>
Kaldaur smiled. "Ahh, you know. Life is pretty boring from my view. Any action lately?" He yearned for a new story of battle to be told.
<br><br>
"Nay. Nothing has been happenin that needs to be said. The ogres continue ta attack the guardhouse ner the crossroads. They are not suceedin, though, because of our stalwart guards. How goes the preparations for supper tonight?"
<br><br>
"Aye, all goes well. Tallor and I have been continuing my training, with combat and dinner plates." Haendor smiled at that remark. "Dinner shall be prepared around 6 p.m. I have brought you your lunch."
<br><br>
"That was thoughtful of ye, laddie." He turned to the other guard on duty. "Gohkor. Kal brought us our lunch for today."
<br><br>
The other guard walked over, nodding at Kaldaur. " 'ello Kal. 'ow are ya?"
<br><br>
"I'm fine, Gohkor. I have everything right here." He opened his backpack and laid out the eating supplies. The two guard's mouths watered hungrily when they saw the food put on the tree stump before them. Kal already had laid out the dining cloth, and now set the food out in two spots, for each guard. He smiled as he saw the last accessory of lunch. "I have something else for you guys. Compliments of Tumpy." He drew out a dwarven ale, two of them in fact.
<br><br>
"Aye, we must thank our friend Tumpy! An ale made by the Brewmaster of Kaladim is a treat indeed." Haendor picked up one of the ales and turned it around, inspecting it. "Twas mighty thoughtful of ye to save them for us, Kal. Any dwarf would have been tempted by such a delicacy." He took the second container and tossed it to Gohkor, and they popped the two corks open. Throwing them up in the air in a mock toast, they started to gulp the ale down. 
<br><br>
Kaldaur smiled. He had not really acquired a taste for ale yet, but he had been told it came when a dwarf reached the age of fifty or so, which was an early stage of dwarven life. With the average life span now about 250 years, dwarves were inhabiting the continent in larger numbers. The only being to outlive the dwarves were the tall Elves. Kaldaur distrusted elves, as most of them saw no need for combat up close. Too damn cocky in his mind. Of course, most dwarves didn't like elves, so he figured it was just genes. He had never really met an elf, so he didn't know what they acted like. The stories were told every night of elves reaching the crossroads and spreading their magicks all over the land. 
<br><br>
More and more dwarves had started to become clerics, and it was suggested that some had even started to experiment with wizardry. Absurd, to think that dwarves would waste their time with magicks not used to heal other dwarves in combat. He was mulling all this over in his head, when he spotted some dim figures in the daylight. They were just coming over the hill, and as they continued to run in his direction, he counted about twenty or so. The guards, in good cheer because of the ale, were not paying attention to the duties that went along with guarding the city. Kaldaur upon closer inspection saw that the skin of the approaching targets was green.
<br><br>
Goblins.
<br><br>
Kaldaur let out a yell of battle, and shouted so that all in the nearby land might hear him, "Dwarves! To arms! The goblins attack!" He took out his rusty long sword and charged his enemy.
<br><br>
Kaldaur knew he was a match for three goblins at the most, but all his skills were being honed in on one objective: save Kaladim. Make sure the Goblins do not reach the city. If he achieved that goal, everything would be fine. He was thinking that right up to the point where the goblin's fist cam down hard upon his head.
<br><br>
Kaldaur's initial response to the attack was one of extreme anger, threatening to take over. But in order for him to do the most damage possible, he needed to keep his cool until the right moment. As he dodged an attack from another goblin, he noticed that most were staying back, as if sizing up Kaldaur. If this continued, he could lower their numbers significantly. The two goblins attacking Kaldaur were just trying to kill him without any strategy. He threw himself to one side of the goblin, twisting his opponent up. He swung around and brought his sword down upon his enemy. Three quick strokes rendered the first goblin helpless on the floor. He quickly turned to face his other opponent. Who was gone.
<br><br>
Kaldaur cursed, realizing his error. He turned again just in time to see the goblin's fist crash into his face. Kaldaur almost blacked out from the force, and immediately realized this was no ordinary goblin. It was a goblin warrior, a combat class of goblins. 
<br><br>
His brethren were arriving on the scene, and as soon as they saw the opposition, flew into combat. A nearby cleric healed Kaldaur once, giving him a much needed boost of energy. He brought his sword up to parry the goblin, and as his foe was striking again, Kaldaur disappeared.
<br><br>
The goblin stopped. Snorting for air, he glanced cunningly. The dwarf was gone. That was impossible as he had just seen the thing in front of his face just moments ago.
<br><br>
Kaldaur swung with the precision and accuracy of the greatest swordsman in the land. The goblin heard the singing of the sword, and swung around. His arm fell to the ground. 
<br><br>
The goblin howled in furious rage as he used his good arm to try to punch Kaldaur, but he was extremely off balance and ended up tangling his feet. That would be his undoing. 
	<br><br>
Kaldaur jumped up into the air as the goblins was swinging, hoping to get his other arm. But the goblin exposed his back in his moment of temporary disorientation. Kaldaur took advantage of the situation and brought his sword down upon the warrior's back. The goblin heaved once, let out a painful cry, and fell to the ground. The goblin started to crawl back to the mountains, and for a moment Kaldaur considered letting him go, to live in disgrace for having been defeated. But then the fury of the battle came back to him and he ended to pitiful life of the goblin with one more cleaving of his sword. 
<br><br>
With his present target eliminated, he turned his attention back to the other battle raging on. Ten of his brethren had engaged seventeen goblins. He charged forth, hoping to even out the odds a little. The goblins had other plans.
<br><br>
Four goblins waylaid him on his way. They all jumped out of a tree, effectively knocking Kaldaur down to the ground. He was vulnerable in this position, and the goblins exploited his weakness. Punch after punch fell into Kaldaur's gut, and he lost all of his air for a time. Unable to even parry, he watched helplessly as he was pummeled. He made peace with Brell, and said a silent message of thanks to Tallor for his teaching. His last vision was another goblin warrior bringing his fist down right to Kaldaur's nose, and then he saw no more.
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">

Tallor soaked the towel in a bucket of water, then laid it on Kaldaur's forehead. As soon as he put the cloth down, he went back to tend to Kaldaur's other wounds. He had been caring for his pupil since early hours, and still the younger dwarf showed no signs of awaking. Tallor knew his student was alive, but no sign of consciouness had arisen yet. He took off the wet cloth from Kaldaur's leg, and resoaked it in cold water. The city doctor had just been here. His prognosis of Kaldaur was good, but he warned Tallor that when he awoke, not to press him back into duty for many days until his own authorization. Tallor agreed wholeheartedly, because he would not be able to stand seeing his friend in any more pain. Kaldaur would recover, and when he did, he would rest and then continue the glory worthy of the dwarves.
<br><br>
A small groan emanated from Kaldaur's mouth. Tallor immediately turned his attention up to his face, and after much effort on the sick man's part, he opened his eyes. Blinking and squinting in the light, he whispered, "Tallor? Is that you?"
<br><br>
"Aye, it is me. You had us worried Kaldaur. Almost thought we had lost ye." He wanted Kaldaur to think he had fought back from death, making it sound like he had a great inner strength. He did, to be sure, but this would only boost it in an otherwise bad time for Kaldaur.
<br><br>
"The goblins?" Tallor was proud. After a quick self-diagnostic, Kaldaur hastily turned to duty. Fitting for a dwarf
<br><br>
"They were hunted down and eliminated. There were thirty-six."
<br><br>
Kaldaur winced, knowing he had been off in his counting. A fatal mistake if leading troops. He would have to work on amplifying his vision. "How many casualties?"
<br><br>
"Twelve dead, fifteen wounded. Yourself included. We fought well. The dead have been honored." 
<br><br>
"I am glad my...friends and family...answered my call to battle. It is fitting of dwarves."
<br><br>
"Get some rest, my friend. You need to rest completely in order to return to duty as soon as possible. Sleep well, and know that you did your part." Tallor rose, smiling at his pupil.
<br><br>
"Thank you, Tallor. Go..odnight..." Kaldaur trailed off, closing his eyes. Tallor nodded absently to the sleeping figure, then walked out of the hut. He did not look back. If he had, he might have seen Kaldaur get up slowly and bow down to his bed.
<br><br>
"I now pray to you, my father, that you will guide me in battle. I shall avenge you, till the day I die." Kaldaur, almost collapsing from fatigue, crawled back into bed and went to sleep. He would live to fight another day, and that was all he asked.
