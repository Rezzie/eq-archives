Some quick thoughts that came up this week:
<br><br>
I created another new character.  I wanted to test out how many rude or greedy people I ran across in the course of creating a character.  After about 6 hours of play, My character is 5th level, and has been given outright 4 pieces of bronze armor, bought a crysknife for only 5pp, and has been buffed to the gills several times by helpful players <em>unasked</em>.  In that time, I traveled from Kelthin to Rivervale, and only ONCE had someone ask me "Cen I have ur boots, I'm a lowly paladin".  One rude person per six hours, I think that's good.
<br><br>
I still like playing EQ - after over a year of playing since beta 1.  I feel like I haven't touched the best parts of Norrath yet because I haven't leveled high enough, so there is a lot more to explore.  Wow.
<br><br>
There aren't enough myths or legends in the official religion documents done on the EQ main site,  there is only the creation myth which details most of the gods.  I think that we need to really make a concerted effort to write our own myths and legends.  They should probably be written from different races point of view, as legends are not always fact, but point to a greater truth which won't be obscured by a different version or point of view.
<br><br>
We need a calendar based on the mythos and religions.  Festivals, taboo dates, dates of worship, that sort of thing.  Though it might be hard to put into practice,  (imagine waking up at 3am Real Time so you could participate on some Norrathian holiday that occurs at night) it would add more to the sense of a life in Norrath that goes on, rather than only happens when you are logged in.
<br><br>
I want books in Norrath.  I want there to be a skill called scribing that lets a player take pen and paper, go to a "scriptorium" and hit combine and make a book, an actual physical object in Norrath, that people can read.  Higher level skills would enable a player to take an <b>original</b> book, and make a copy of it.  You wouldn't be able to make a copy of a copy.  Really high levels should allow for copying of magical words and books pages, with the proper tools and materials.  It should be expensive to make books, to discourage abusers who write something nasty and people who want to spam objects into Norrath.  I want to be an author in Norrath, and have my book "Flora and Fauna of the Qeynos Hills" hit the bestseller list.
<br><br>
I want my gamma correction to work on my new TnT2 32M video card.  Norrath is surely not as black as it looks :P.
<br><br>
Have a great week!
