Now we have charts of statistics, hints of spoilers, lists of lists and all sorts of other mechanical data, some players wonder where we stand on role-playing. I can attest to the fact that role-playing is contagious, and the environment for role-playing is being built. We start to see more of the vast background for Norrath during our daily quests and journeys to new places, and even just the world itself has some classic role-playing value.
<br><br>
	Each Race has its own home city, and most of the cities are pretty far from each other. Most new players could not safely run from one city to another, and if they did they would do so at great risk of losing their lives and belongings. A few races do start close enough to each other to share hunting grounds from the start, such as Wood Elves and High Elves. Dwarves and Gnomes could realistically also go to the same hunting grounds but if they die it is a long walk back to where you died to get your corpse. What all of these factors lead to is a sense of home for everyone. This sense of home really adds to the immersive nature of the world.
<br><br>
	Since each race has different aspects of society, even within each race the different professions have different areas of the greater regions that they might frequent. For instance what the starting map doesn't show is the fact that some professions don't even necessarily start in the same zone, or even inside the same city limits as the other professions. 989 took it a John Glenn step further with the seldom-mentioned "alignment" system. These "alignments" are called factions, which are very similar in a nutshell to AD&D alignments, yet <b>astronomically</b> more complex. I refer to them here but I will spare the details, which is something everyone should learn about first-hand.
<br><br>
	With that all said, are players role playing though? Well, any answer is a correct one depending on your point of view. Anyone who requires that you have read the Shakespearean works to role-play a correct troubadour might feel that not very many players are role-playing. There is a lot of out-of-character chatter dealing with beta and technical issues, which should very well be expected during a beta test. Mechanically speaking almost everyone is role-playing in some manner as long as they are following along with the basic "faction" system. In a way it encourages players into a rudimentary role that most anyone could agree with. While this doesn't make everyone a good role-player (at all) it helps define roles for those that do want to role-play.
<br><br>
	I do see many players role playing, even if just casually. Not many players use the out of character chat prefixes the way they were meant, but those that do use it benefit from it as it colors your text a different color. I have found that when travelling with casual gamers if you play in-role, they usually do the same. It is a contagious activity, often because there are mechanical values to what you might be role playing, such as a quest or attack on an Orc camp. It turns the phrase "lets go get loot in the dungeon" into a somewhat acceptable role playing phrase with only a little effort, making it "lets make our way to Crushbone and show the Orcs what happens when they walk on Elven soil."
<br><br>
	In short, I would say that people that used to role play are still doing so and having fun, and those that hate role playing are not role playing, and are not ruining the fun for others that do. Those between the two types have more of a role to play, and those that have never role played before get the opportunity to start in the best environment yet.
