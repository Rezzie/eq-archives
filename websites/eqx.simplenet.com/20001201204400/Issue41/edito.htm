<b>Ignore the man behind the machine!  I am OZ - an essay</b>
<br><br>

	A few years ago, after I had become a builder on a mud I was playing, one of my fellow builders offered me a chance to play on another MUD that he had designed.  With it, he included access to much of the code he had written, so I perused it carefully.  I read the stats on the classes and races, and picked a class/race combo which looked good.  I chose monsters who were easier kills with high exp, and monsters who had good loot. I did quests by reading the correct responses in the code and doing them.   I rocketed through the levels until I reached an odd conclusion - I wasn't having any fun.
<br><br>
	Game mechanic knowledge is the death of wonder.  I knew more about that mud than any other player, and knew next to nothing about how it felt at the same time.  My friends carefully designed environment had become a mass of numbers and statistics, instead of magical world of fantasy.  I never feared for my character's life, since I knew almost exactly how tough ever monster was in comparison.  I asked me friend to delete my character and started again difference class, different race...
<br><br>
	I walked the forests and met frightening orcs.  I ran for my life from the Goblin King, who I had ignored earlier since he wasn't a high-gain monster.  I designed my own methods for figuring monster strength, and found new riches in the interactions with quests that I hadn't done.  I was able to tell my friend that his world was challenging, fun, and imaginative, and I was richer for it.
<br><br>
	How much game-mechanics knowledge is good?  We all have played games, and have a good sense of how different games work, and the game mechanics used for skills, advancement, spell casting, etc.  We can look at a game with an experienced eye to discover what system, in general, it uses, and we can use that information to powergame.  We do it all the time, no matter what game it is.  It's hard to imagine separating the gaming experience form the use of that knowledge.  So how is this different from what I did?
<br><br>
	I think what I did was to have all the answers.  There was no doubts, no curiosity, no what if? questions running around in my head, and therefore there was no involvement with the process.  Had I more programming talent, I could have written a script to run my character through the MUD and just gather up exp. and money.  All I would get out of it was a buffed character I could take no pride in, who had no history and a lot of gold.
<br><br>
	Besides that, the hints, cheats and such that come around after a game is released makes one wonder why a game designer bothered creating brain-teasers, if they are going to be handed out, solved, to everyone?  EQVault has a policy to not do that, and they were criticized by some with the ridiculous argument that since other sites were bound to do it, then EQVault's stance was going to hurt them.  Other commentaries, however, saw it differently… hints and cheats take the "play" out of a game.
<br><br>
	If we would-be testers in EverQuest are privy to such information, should we get it?  Should we use it?  The scenario is different… There may be a justifiable reason for us to have access to that sort of information… and anyway, we're testing it, aren't we?
<br><br>
	989 has plenty of code-knowledgeable testers in-house.  They look over the code all day, they write it, and they correct it.  They know how it should work.  We, on the other hand, don't.  And this is a GOOD THING.
<br><br>
	Perception is the careful balancing of knowledge and intellect, and the ability to recognize patterns and gain insights.  This is what we hopefully bring to the EQ beta testing experience.  This perception, however could be clouded by too much knowledge - that assumption of the way things are supposed to be which a programmer has from his work on a program.  If we let knowledge or expectation cloud our perception, we won't be doing our beta-testing job.  We have to approach everything in-game with a question in our mind.  We are trying to break EverQuest.  Assumptions about how things should work can sometimes leave us to overlook minor glitches.  Knowing TOO MUCH is bad.
<br><br>
	Besides that, knowing too much leads us into the search for cheats and hacks.  While this is a good thing in some ways, the temptation for many testers is too strong… if you could a abuse a bug twice and get away with it… and your character substantially benefit, would you do it?  Even if you were testing?
<br><br>
	The first few phases of testers are supposed to be the cream of the ORPG crop.  They are supposed to have better judgment.  There is a reason they are there, and they should test like the game is their own.
