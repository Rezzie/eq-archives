	Chaotic bursts of fire and ice exploded in all directions.  Wildly flickering lights bounced in all directions. He could see nothing but his sword in front of him and smell only the mingled scents of sulfur and blood. His vision was blurred by sweat, and stained red by blood. He sensed movement directly above him and shook his head to clear his vision. When he lifted his head to look, he saw a widening darkness descending rapidly upon him.

<br><br>
	Darnack sat bolt upright on his bedroll. Sweat poured down his forehead and into his eyes, a stinging reminder of the events that had occurred in the dream which had startled him from slumber. He had been plagued by these dreams for months now, and grew weary of the lack of rest. He looked to the hearth of his fireplace and noted that the fire had burned down considerably. 
<br><br>
	He stood and shook the cobwebs of sleep out of his head. It would be morning soon, and he would have no more chance to rest. He took a small lantern that was perched atop the mantle and lit it using one of the partially consumed branches from the now dying fire. He walked out the door and into the chill morning air. The sun had not yet risen and all was dark. The scents of the night fires and fresh fallen snow washed over him and cleansed his mind of the remainder of the dream. He walked to the back of his humble home and opened the door to a sturdy shed which stood connected to the side of the building.   The flickering light from the lantern filled this small room and reflected off his armor, which was hung with great care in the back of the room. He examined each piece individually in the wavering lamplight and noted every dent and scratch. His father was a blacksmith, and Darnack had learned enough of the family trade to know what would cause problems, and how to fix it. 
<br><br>
	After his initial examination, he equipped himself with each piece. His new skin of bronze shone sporadically in the faltering light as he reached for his final piece of equipment. He pulled his father's sword from its resting-place on the wall, and walked back outside into the billowing drifts of snow.
<br><br>


	I awoke that morning shivering in the cold Halas air. I pulled the bear skin tightly around me and looked around the room. The fire was long dead and cold, and Darnack was nowhere to me seen. I stood up to stretch and noticed that the bedroll Darnack had been sleeping on was now gone. There was a loaded backpack leaned up against the wall by the door, and wet footprints crowded around the entryway. 
<br><br>
	I took my packs and began to prepare myself for the day's journey. This place was most inhospitable to me, and I wondered how exactly I would keep warm.
<br><br>
	The door opened and Darnack walked in. "Good morning, Dark One!" He exclaimed cheerily.
<br><br>
	"I see you are ready to set out," I said as I examined his armor and glanced at his backpack.
<br><br>
	"Aye, that I am." He said. "I am a bit of an early riser of late, and I took this opportunity to prepare myself for our coming travels. I have enough food to last both of us a week or so, and various supplies. It looked as though you were fairly well stocked for one, but better too much than not enough."
<br><br>
	"Certainly." I said as I finished adjusting my various packs. "By chance is there a tailor nearby? I will need some warmer attire if we are to remain here long."
<br><br>
	"Oh, yes. I already thought of that." He replied as he pulled a thick pair of leggings from his pack. "Bear hide, of course. Not exactly much else around here. This should help a bit as well." 
<br><br>
	He handed me a thick bear hide cloak that was very similar to his own. I slipped it over my shoulders and felt instantly warmed. 
<br><br>
	"This is remarkable," I proclaimed, "Its quite warm."
<br><br>
	"My sister donated it for the cause. She will be remaining in this area for a while, and figured you may need it."
<br><br>
	"I will have to thank her should I meet her."
<br><br>
	"Are we ready to go then?" He asked.
<br><br>
	"Yes, let's."

<br><br>
	It seemed a rather awkward beginning to a friendship that would eventually last as long as ours, but everything must start somewhere. I followed my new friend all the way through the peaks of everfrost. He was well versed in the area, and the trip through this blinding white maze of peaks and valleys lasted less than a day.  By late afternoon, we arrived at a cave with a familiar feel. The smell of rot and pounded at my senses and reminded me of my last time here. I faltered a bit at the prospect of traversing this dangerous expanse yet again, but Darnack assured me that he knew the best way.

<br><br>
	He strode right up to the cave entrance where two of the foul beasts had apparently been to guard. They eyed him threateningly as he approached the stronghold, and then proceeded to attack. One of the foul jackals drew a sword and lunged at Darnack's throat. Darnack lashed out at the beast and ripped a gaping hole into its free arm. A bellowing yelp issued forth from this hounds long snout and it attempted again to slash. Its blow was defected harmlessly by the warrior's armor, and Darnack slashed again. This time his blow landed squarely across the chest of the beast and sliced efficiently through the layers of fur and flesh.
<br><br>
The gnoll fell quickly, and emitted a guttural growl. As Darnack dispatched the first, the second of the two guards bashed Darnack on the back of the head, stunning him. As the creature reared back for a second blow, I felt the energies within me stir, and I began to cast. The filthy dog's fur burst into flame as I released the energy from my casting. It screamed and turned toward me. The magical flames died down quickly, and the smoldered profusely. Darnack regained his sense of direction, and spun around to face the smoking animal. Once he slashed at the back of the beast, and then again. The animal looked surprised as its innards rapidly exited its body from the wounds left by Darnack's blade and collected in a steaming pile between its feet. It teetered and snarled as if it would remain standing like that, posed forever in death, but it finally fell. 
<br><br>
	Darnack nodded, satisfied with the victory.
<br><br>
	"These were weak," he said gruffly. "The ones inside will actually put up a fight. Be ready for chaos as we pass through. The others will smell blood and come running."
<br><br>
	Howls and screams echoed from within the caves.  We went into the darkness of this gash in the side of the mountains, moving at a rapid pace through the various twists and turns. Another of the beasts, this one slightly larger than the previous "guards" lunged at us from the penetrating darkness. I quickly channeled a burst of cold, encasing it in ice, then released that burning heat again. The hard shell of ice exploded violently away, taking large amounts of fur and skin with it. 
<br><br>
Darnack engaged it head on and slashed. The beast raised its sword to meet Darnack's blow and blocked it entirely. Blood oozed out the various sores my casting had left. I seared it once again with fire as Darnack slashed furiously, taking off one of its arms in the process. One final blast of cold, and the jackal fell for good. 
<br><br>
	We went forward through the myriad twists and turns and eventually came to the crevasse that I had so foolishly leaned into.  Several of the gnolls were gathered at a small camp to the right, and came running in search of the commotion that they had sensed from within the corridor. There had to have been five of them, and I knew that they had us outnumbered. They crowded around Darnack and began to beat upon his armored body. Still the warrior fought on, slashing away at whichever of the mongrels was unlucky enough to find themselves in the path of his blade. I singed each that he struck as he turned his attention to them, but I felt the weakness of exhaustion setting in. I was wearing heavily upon my own magical stamina, and would have to rest soon. I finally dropped two of the five beasts before I finally knew that I could cast no more. I hurried to the back of the fray and began beating wildly on one of the canine foes with the staff I carried for travel. Its ribs cracked under my blow, and it yelped in pain. The gnoll turned and lashed at me with its claws, ripping across my chest, and shredding my robe. I brought the staff crashing down upon the gnoll's shoulder, and felt the satisfying thud of my strike hitting home. Darnack was still tearing into the remaining two beasts, but I could tell he was wearing down. I was so distracted with Darnacks's condition that I didn't notice that my current adversary had picked up a staff of its own and was preparing to reciprocate my previous wounds to it. I attempted to side step the staff, but it came crashing down upon my already sore leg. I screamed in pain as the searing heat of pain filled my leg. I Directed my burning gaze and directed what little there was of my magical energy towards the filth that had injured me so. The gnoll erupted into a stinking ball of flying fur and cast itself off the edge of the crevasse on its own volition. I tried to limp over to assist Darnack again, but as I did, I saw a flash of light off to my left and heard a familiar casting. Darnack glowed with this light briefly and suddenly surged with strength. He bashed one of the remaining two gnolls with the pommel of his sword, crushing its already misshapen skull. A wash of scintillating colors surrounded the last remaining gnoll. It stared vacantly into this display and showed no more interest in the world around it. Darnack took this brief opportunity to run his sword through the hound's midsection, and the beast fell. 
<br><br>
	Darnack's chest heaved with the exertion. His nostrils flared with a mix of anger and pride. 
<br><br>
	"I leave you alone for one day and you go getting yourself into trouble!" Came the familiar voice of my brother from across the expanse of the crevasse. 
<br><br>
	"You don't know the half of it!" I yelled back.
<br><br>
	I looked over at my warrior friend to see him relieving the gnolls of their meager possessions. 
<br><br>
	He looked up from his task, smiled, and said, "They wont be needing them anymore."
<br><br>
	"Lets get out of here before those howls come any closer. I need to rest, and I don't think we want the attention of all the residents here at once."
<br><br>
	The barbarian ripped a tooth from the mouth of one of the larger beasts he had slain and tossed it into his backpack. He then turned to me and stepped over the corpses.
<br><br>
	"Lets go."
<br><br>
	We moved quickly around the crevasse towards my brother. He stood smiling smugly next to one of his animations.
<br><br>
	"You look day old fish bait," said Gulinast with a gleam in his eye. "Who's the stiff in the tin can?"
<br><br>
	Darnack seemed to pay no mind to the banter. He was more entranced by the animation than anything my younger brother could have ever say.
<br><br>
	"By the Six Hammers! What is that thing?" The barbarian exclaimed.
<br><br>
	"Darnack, meet Gulinast. He is my younger brother." 
<br><br>
	Darnack looked from the animation to me and said, "Not much of a resemblance."
<br><br>
	"Not the animation, big guy." Gulinast stated proudly, "She meant me. Gulinast Raevenchylde, at your service."
<br><br>
	Gulinast bowed with a flourish. He was in rare form today.
	<br><br>
	"Darnack Plainswalker, Wolf of the North." Darnack nodded.
<br><br>
	"I owe Darnack my life." I told Gulinast. "He will be assisting us in our future travels. His strength will be a great asset to us."
<br><br>
	"You sure picked a big one. He looks like he could eat a gnome for breakfast and still have room for a halfling."
<br><br>
	The howls of the locals suddenly raised to a deafening roar behind us. We could here the barking and growling of the gnolls as they rallied together to apprehend the foes who had slain their kin. 
<br><br>
	"We best be on our way." Said Darnack as he looked over his shoulder at the caves. "They don't sound too happy."
<br><br>
	"Good idea, lets get you home, sister. Mother is worried sick about you."
<br><br>
	Without another word, we headed out of that hellish place. We arrived in Qeynos by late evening, and secured rooms in the Lion's Mane Inn. I lay in yet another strange bed, and felt somehow lost and at home at the same time. Sleep came quickly to me that night. I can remember that I dreamed, but I know not of what.
