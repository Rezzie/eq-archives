This was an attempt to build a dwarven ethos and history, without any Norrath background. None of it is official!  - Oghma
<br><br>
<b>We are the rock upon which Norrath rests. First of Brell's children, from our forges came the mountains of Norrath. From our bellows came the winds, and from the billows of steam as we quenched our steel came the clouds. Seven Fathers have we, and seven clans.</b>
<br><br>
	Dwarves are a short, stocky race, averaging about 4-4 1/2' tall. They often have ruddy complexions, dark hair, and piercing, dark eyes. They are much stronger than the average human, and dexterous. The natural life span for a dwarf is about 350 years. They are a serious lot, given rarely to frivolity. They prefer a good, hard day's work and are fiercely protective of family and clan. Though sometimes considered dour or taciturn, few doubt the dwarves' courage or bravery. They have little talent for magic not of the enchantment/craft sort, but excel at fighting, war craft, and arts such as smithing, masonry, mining, and engineering. 
<br><br>
	Dwarves typically live in hilly or mountainous regions, enjoying the strength of the earth and the rocks that make up their underground homes. Dwarves mine the earth for precious metals and gems, and they are particularly fond of gold. Dwarven communities are usually in huge mines underground, and combat skill is very appreciated, as is skill with mining and metal working. 
<br><br>
	Dwarves breed slowly and regard above earth-dwellers with distrust. Dwarves are regarded neutrally by other races. Most dwarves have difficulty with greed, due to their love of gold and fine craftsmanship. Their craftsmanship is appreciated and skillful dwarven smiths enjoy much respect. Dwarves of both sexes wear beards, and they tend to prefer wearing somber colors, usually in plaids or solid colors. 
<br><br>
	Dwarves worship Brell Serellis in the form of an ancestor figure. They also revere ancestors of particular note, such as the seven fathers and rulers/heroes who have accomplished great deeds for the dwarven race, or craftsmen who have forged items of surpassing wonder and beauty. The gloomy dwarven world view comes from their belief in the inexorable power of fate as the strands of time and destiny weave a pattern which they believe cannot be overcome. Dwarves' esteem is given to those who bear their fate intrepidly. Their high sense of honor, and their distaste for those who bring dishonor upon their family and clan is a reflection of this. A dwarf who tries to avoid fate through cowardly actions is reviled as less than a dwarf. Passive acceptance of fate is not the Dwarven way, either, as dwarves are too industrious and active to bow their heads to doom. A fierce bravery in the face of overwhelming odds is the indomitable strength of the dwarven race. It is this sense of honor that fuels the dwarves sense of duty to family, clan, and craft. For a dwarf to create something with less than complete and total focus on high craftsmanship is unthinkable. In fact, the dwarf word for a lazy person (<em>calass</em>) is the same as the word for thief. 
<br><br>
	The seven dwarf clans are the descendants of the first seven dwarves created by Brell Serelis. Between them, they embody all the qualities for which dwarves are known. Although each clan has a special field of expertise in which it excels, not all clan members practice in that field. Clans are not a political body per se, more of a familial one. Clans intermarry frequently, and although there have been clan wars in the past, the clans at present get along well. Every year the clanmoot occurs, where the clan council meets. This is a time of great feasting and merriment. The clan leaders try to resolve political events and misunderstandings in an unofficial way. Occasionally, the clan leaders will unite the dwarves in an "<em>alag-ilith</em>" or "glory pact" for a great undertaking in the interests of the dwarven race. While the Kings of the Dwarves have in their charge their respective nations, the clan leaders have in their charge the dwarven race.
<br><br>
<b>Runedar</b> - Family/ruling - Founder, Runedin<br>
Artifact: the crown of Runedar, currently held by the head of the clan
<br><br>
	The Runedar are the leaders of all the Dwarves. Most dwarves are involved in them somewhere down the line, from the Patriarch of individual families, to the leaders of huge guilds. Organized and efficient, the Runedar are known for their foresight and planning ability. Those who belong to the clan are taught to lead from a young age. This leadership gives the dwarves the organized and efficient community they're famous for. The power of the clan lies not in their physical skills, but in their ability to motivate other dwarves to work to the best of their ability.
<br><br>
<b>Sonndar</b> - stonecraft - Founder, Sonndalin<br>
Artifact: the Hammer and Chisel of Sonndar, currently lost.
<br><br>
	The vaulted archways and curving stairways of the Dwarven cities owe their creation to the stone-crafters of Sonndar. Passing along their building lore from generation to generation, the skills of the Sonndar clan are not only valued in Kaladim, but throughout Norrath. They can build an archway to support an army, or a castle for a king, always at the highest standard. When one thinks about the finest in dwarven architecture, one thinks of the Sonndar. This clan, though in high demand "up above", is one of the two clans that dislikes leaving their underground cities.
<br><br>
<b>Devlar</b> - earthlore - Founder, Devlin<br>
Artifact: the Pick of Devlin, currently lost.
<br><br>
	Delving into the bowels of the earth, The Devlar are the miners of the dwarves. Being the source of much of the dwarves wealth, this is one of the richest clans. Rarely seen on the surface, this clan is known only to the dwarves and other beings which dwell underground. A Devlar dwarf tends to be stockier than their counterparts in other tribes. Even though they're one of the least known clans, they're highly respected in dwarven society.
<br><br>
<b>Aeglar</b> - tradecraft/wealth - Founder, Aeglin<br>
Artifact: Aeglin's golden coin, currently lost. 
<br><br>
	Lively and quick witted, the Aeglar could almost be considered friendly by other races. The Aeglar are the negotiators, the explorers , and the risk-takers of the Dwarvish race. They tend to flaunt their wealth more then other dwarves, and have since become targets of the jealousy of other races. They tend to be open to new ideas, but have a miserly streak which also wins them fewer friends. As the merchants and ambassadors of the dwarven race, the Aeglar are most often seen on the surface.
<br><br>
<b>Donnar</b> - Metalcraft - Founder, Dun<br>
Artifact: the Hammer of Dun currently held by the Mastersmith of the Forge of Kaladim.
<br><br>
	The Donnar craftsmen are world-renowned for their skill and artistry. Many artifacts of whatever race or background were forged by the Donnar. They are the world-renowned smiths of the dwarven empire. They make anything from weapons for the greatest warriors, to pots to cook with. Donnar tend towards introspection, as their intense focus on quality leads them to be quiet, thoughtful folk. They tend at times to be impatient with fools and those whose lack of intensity results in plans gone awry, or unnecessary loss.
<br><br>
<b>Kuldar</b> - Warcraft - founder, Kul<br>
Artifact: The Axe of Kul, currently lost.
<br><br>
	Brave and mighty in battle, the Kuldar are the shock troops of the dwarven race. They fiercely defend the dwarven nation, and all dwarves across Norrath. They take pride in their organization in combat--indeed, as an army, the Kuldar can rarely be bested. More than any other clan, the Kuldar tend to be boisterous and boastful, reveling in their prowess. "The Last Defense of Kul" where Kaladim was saved and the Axe lost, is the battle epic by which all others are judged.
<br><br>
<b>Xothar</b> - Faith/Lore - Founder Xothin<br>
Artifact: the Kodex of Xothin, currently held in an undisclosed location by the Xothar clan.
<br><br>
	The Clan Xothar is the spiritual leader of the dwarven nation. They've spent their existence maintaining the dwarven faith in Brell Serillis, as well as recording all of the dwarven history. The Xothar are the sages and advisors of the dwarves. The priests of the dwarvish communities are often drawn from this clan, as are the bards and lore masters. A group of scholars and clerics, they are truly the core of the dwarven society, binding all the clans together as much as do the Runedar The Xothar tend to be thoughtful and eloquent, often having insights based on their deep knowledge of history. Nearly all dwarven expeditions anywhere have at least one member of the Xothar along, as a guide, healer, and historian.
