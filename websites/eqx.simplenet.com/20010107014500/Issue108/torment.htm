The dark elf prophet Saphyre and her friend Lapys sit at the edge of the giant slave pit playing one of their favorite games.
<br><br>
"Okay... that's six points for me, Lapys... and you have seven points," she says. The slaves at the bottom moan and yell at the two dark elves above, too high up to reach. Lapys spits another watermellon seed, but misses. "Now its my turn...  I am gonna go for Obert the dwarf, his left leg," says Saphyre.  The dark elf maiden takes her slingshot and shoots a pebble at the dwarf who tries to dodge her attack. 
<br><br>
SWOOOOSH!!!!  TINK!!
<br><br>
"Missed!  RATS!" yells Saphyre. "Your turn, Lapys.  Don't forget to call it." Lapys gets his slingshot ready.  "Okay," Lapys looks pensively at all the slaves down below. "The human Boris, right arm!" Lapys aims carefully then shoots.
<br><br>
SWOOOOSH!!   OWWW!   #(*@$(*#*($&!!!
<br><br>
"GOT HIM!" cheers Lapys. 
<br><br>
"Foul Shot!  Ye got him in the eye!  What did I tell you about that?" yells Saphyre. "Father says we can torment the slaves, but we are not allowed to maim them cuz they are kept here to service us as needed!  Grrrrr!" Saphyre looks down at the injured human.  He sits with his hands covering his eye. Blood trickles down his cheek. The slave cries in pain. The other slaves cower to the outer edges of the pit, hoping the game is over.  
<br><br>
"Oh no... I think Boris is bleeding, Lapys! Sigh... Father is gonna be furious!" moans Saphyre. 
<br><br>
"We can find a cleric. It would be simple enough for one of them to heal him," says Lapys. The young necromancer looks down at the human, trying to assess the seriousness of the injury. Lapys shrugs, "Your turn."
<br><br>
Saphyre deducts two points from the scorecard under Lapys' name. "Okay... now its six to five... and we have a bleeder.  sigh..." she looks up at her friend.  She isn't interested in the game anymore. She knows full well the temper of Darkmoon's Patriarch, Keiote', and being his daughter isn't going to help her any.  If anything, he has come to expect more from her as his daughter and prophet than any other child of Innoruuk. She bites her lower lip and grimaces at the thought of his wrath should he learn they have disobeyed his orders. She doesn't need one of her premonitions to know she is in deep trouble. This isn't fun anymore. The young prophet looks down at Boris and cringes. 
<br><br>
"Nay, one of us should go down there now and try to bandage Boris. We can't go to a cleric. Father knows them all. And if he finds out, he won't let us play 'Shoot the slave' anymore and... and..." says the young prophet.
<br><br>
"Okay, you go.  They won't dare hurt the Patriarch's daughter and prophet."  says Lapys.
<br><br>
"ME?!  I wasn't the one that shot his eye out! You GO!" demands Saphyre.
<br><br>
"Well... okay... but then you forfeit this game so I win." Lapys looks nervous as he takes off his good cloak and stands up. He looks down into the pit. If he isn't careful those slaves will see to it he doesn't come out of there alive.  The miserable humans, dwarves and elves begin to watch him prepare himself. They move around in anticipation of getting their hands on an "inkie" all at once. 
<br><br>
"What are you two young ones doing?" Atos says. The elegantly dressed dark elf cleric enters the area.  She smiles at the young prophet and her companion. Saphyre and Lapys turn and bow to the Darkmoon Elder.  They look worried and scared.  An anguished cry is heard coming from the pit.  
<br><br>
"Just playing a little game, Senior Elder," Saphyre tries to smile. Atos frowns and goes over to the edge of the pit and looks down.  She spots the injured slave and grimaces.  "Oh, Saphyre.  Didn't the Patriarch warn thee about this?" she says in a soft voice.  Saphyre pouts and lowers her head.  She starts to tremble and looks very guilty.  "Aye, Senior Elder.  He did." she blurts out in a childlike voice. 
<br><br>
"Twas my fault, m'lady Atos.  I... I shot him.  He shouldn't have moved. heheh..." Lapys laughs nervously but stops when Atos gives him a stern look. The Elder casts a strong heal spell and manages to restore the human slave's eye back to normal.  "There," Atos raises one eyebrow and smiles, watching the human look up at her.  He thanks her pitifully for the heal. The cleric Elder nods to the human then turns back to the young dark elves standing beside her. Saphyre looks relieved and begins to bow to Atos. She grins and thanks her Senior Elder. 
<br><br>
"Do be careful now, young ones.  Good slaves are hard to come by, ye know." Atos replies. She checks her nails and straightens her robe nonchalantly.
<br><br>
"Are ye... are ye gonna... tell on us, Senior Elder?" the young prophet asks timidly. 
<br><br>
Atos pauses for a moment on her way out. She turns and gives Saphyre and her companion an evil grin. Her voice is lyrical in reply, "If he doesn't ask... I won't tell."
<br><br>
Atos leaves, pleased with her cleverness. She knows that the two young dark elves are going to fret for a long long time, wondering if the Patriarch is going find out or not. 
<br><br>
Ironically, the young tormentors have now become the tormented.
