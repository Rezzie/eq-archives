    Freygar entered Surefall at a dead run.   The place looked normal, its peace and quiet undisturbed by the turmoil outside.  Three Rangers guarding the entrance sheathed swords and relaxed half-drawn bows as they recognized him and his companion.  Morna glanced quickly around.
<br><br>
   "Let's go to the Great Tree."  She was already in motion.  
<br><br>
   The Great Tree was more than deserving of the name.  Freygar gaped up at the impossible height.  The bark was pulsing swiftly, coruscating bands of light rippling up from the roots and into the vast reaches of the branches.   Inside, the Druids were meditating and praying.  Their soft murmurs mixed with the low vibration of the tree to produce a lulling rhythm.  Freygar fought the urge to sit down and rest.
<br><br>
   Morna paused at the doorway and let Freygar enter first, deferring to him. Te'Anara turned from the council table at the far wall to face him.  
<br><br>
   "First," he said and bowed formally.  "Lord Bayle sent me to…"  he couldn't very well say ferret the truth out of her… "make sure that you are safe."
<br><br>
   She smiled as if she could read on his face every word he had not said.  
<br><br>
   "I am touched by his concern," she said smoothly.  "But we are perfectly fine.  You may tell him I said so."  She turned her back again in an obvious dismissal.
<br><br>
   "Head Druid," said Morna.  "Lord Bayle is concerned.  The High Shaman has disappeared from the battlefield and his Lordship is sure that there is danger to the Glade.  Master Freygar and myself would like to have a look around, to make sure that there is nothing amiss."
<br><br>
    Te'Anara's face went slightly pale at the mention of the Shaman, and for a minute, her eyes went up into the dark hollow of the Tree.  She composed herself swiftly, but Freygar had seen, for that brief moment, a look of both supplication and fear.
<br><br>
   "The Rangers are more than capable of patrolling our borders, thank you."  Her tone went slightly frosty.  "There is only one way in or out, and if Bayle's army does its job, then there is no way for anyone to enter.  The Goddess' presence forbids the magic of any evil god within the Glade, and the Gnolls are not capable of teleportation.  How could anything be amiss?  I will thank you to leave us to our prayer."
<br><br>
   "She's not answering, is she?" asked Freygar.  "Tunare is not answering you."  Morna's eyes went to him in startlement, but no more swiftly than the Head Druid's.
<br><br>
   "Get out!"  The fear that Te'Anara had been hiding showed nakedly on her face.
<br><br>
   At that moment, a distant roar shook the ground.  The Druids' prayers were cut off, and a few cried out.  Te'Anara's face went a dead white.   She turned toward the sound as if she couldn't help herself, and a hand rose slightly.  
<br><br>
   "What is it?" asked Morna harshly.  "You know what is happening, Te'Anara.  Tell us!"
<br><br>
   "No, we cannot interfere.  I cannot help her now!"  She backed away.  Her expression was tormented, lips quivering.
<br><br>
   "Interfere in what?  Help who?"  Freygar seized her shoulders.  Her eyes met his, filled with unshed tears.     He read the answer there, and reared back.  He stared for a second, and then turned and wordlessly ran from the Tree.
<br><br>
    "No!  We cannot interfere!"  Te'Anara cried, and went after him.  
<br><br>
    "Freygar!" called Morna, and followed the Druid.
<br><br>
     Outside, Te'Anara paused, and then gestured swiftly.  Then ground beneath Freygar sprouted roots, thick and gnarled.  They tangled about his feet and legs, stopping him in his tracks.  Cursing, he wrenched out his sword and hacked at them. Rangers came running from all directions, but Morna reached him first.
<br><br>
   "What is she talking about?" she demanded.  "You know!  I see it in your eyes!"
<br><br>
   "Aklar," he panted.  The roots refused to come free. "It's Aklar, I'm sure.  Aklar is the Avatar, and <em>she</em>"  he flung out a hand and pointed an accusing finger at Te'Anara.  "...means to the let the Ritual be performed!"   Morna gasped.  The nearest Ranger stopped dead, and held out a hand to halt the others.  
<br><br>
   "The Avatar?" he repeated in disbelief.  He turned to Te'Anara.  The Druids from the Tree were grouped behind her.  "Te'Anara, what is this man talking about?"
<br><br>
    "It is true," she said calmly, though her eyes were haunted.  "The Avatar will walk among us today."
<br><br>
    "But that means…" The young Druid trailed off, her eyes drawn to the waterfall.  "Mammoth!" she wailed, and fell to her knees.
<br><br>
     "No!" said the Ranger and ripped his short sword from its sheath.  "Not while I live!" He sprinted away.
<br><br>
    "No!" shouted Te'Anara, and began the magic to root him.  She was jostled and shoved aside by the tide of people, her casting interrupted, her command unheeded.  Everyone followed the Ranger, racing into the crystal pool toward the waterfall.  The water was churned to froth by their passage.  "No," she whispered, her hands falling to her sides.  Then she ran after them.  The roots finally came free of Freygar's feet, and he stumbled out of their grip.  Morna clutched at his arm.
<br><br>
   "What do I do?" she demanded.
<br><br>
   "Come with me," Freygar saw Te'Anara disappear behind the waterfall.  He stared for a minute at the expanse of water that separated him from the ledge behind it with trepidation.
<br><br>
   "Always water," he muttered, and took a deep breath.  He floundered across, heart in his mouth for a minute as he lost purchase with the stone bottom of the pond.  Then he was there, heaving himself up onto the ledge, shivering and panting as if he'd run ten miles.  There was a high ceilinged cave, leading further into the mountain.  The Guards at his heels, he followed the wet footsteps in.   Suddenly a woman screamed, and Freygar started.  That voice…it was hoarse, tortured, but he knew it.  Aklar was in there, somewhere, and she was in pain.  He leapt forward.  
<br><br>
   A wind sprang up behind them, nearly knocking them off their feet, howled away before them, filled the air with its shriek.  They staggered on regardless, passing a dead bear, corpse charred almost beyond recognition. They rounded a corner, and piled into the back of a mass of Surefall inhabitants.  The sound of fighting came from ahead, and he forced his way in.  He could see the top of a low doorway, and the flashes of fire that meant spell casting.  He pushed between two Druids, interrupting their casting, and saw Te'Anara dead center in the doorway, strike the floor with her staff.  Two Rangers were keeping a horde of Gnolls from her, twenty at least, while in the room beyond…
<br><br>
   Freygar saw the altar, the looming bulk of the huge bear.  He saw the shamans, casting fire and ice at the few Druids that had made into the room.  He saw the High Shaman, clutching a book to his chest and snarling, backed into a corner.  He saw Anthiel on his knees, hands to his head.  He saw the Dark Elf, turning from the bear, bloody from head to toe, leaning across the altar.  He saw Aklar, her whole body contorted, straining away from the altar, her hands barely hovering above its blood-wet surface.  She screamed again, flinging her head back, whipping it back and forth in hopeless denial.  The Dark Elf reached out a hand, almost tenderly, and laid it on her forehead.  The wind died.
<br><br>
    "No!" Freygar howled.  He dove through the doorway as Te'Anara's spell took shape.  A howling wall of fire sprang into being, and rushed across the floor. The Gnolls fell back, blasted and burned, and the way through was clear.  A rush of Druids and Guards followed Freygar.  The wall of fire died as it reached the chasm in the floor, and Freygar ran through the dying tendrils of fire onto the walkway.  The superheated air dried his clothes, crisped his eyebrows, but he barely noticed.
<br><br>
   Aklar seemed transfixed.  She and the Elf hung for a minute as if frozen in time, and then an explosion of light flung him away.  He hit the wall and fell in a crumpled heap.  Aklar went up on her toes, eyes wide, the light cascading around her,  Her hair and clothes rippled up, flowing as if in a stream of water, reaching for the ceiling.  All the fighting stopped, as both sides, as one, turned toward the altar.  She floated slowly off the floor, arms spread wide, head back.  The blood on the altar began to steam and then rain upward, and as it hit the light it became red streams of mist, mixing and mingling with the ripples.  Slowly a globe of diffused glowing crimson surrounded Aklar.  She seemed to look down, to see Anthiel and Freygar staring at her.  She reached out, imploring, and then the bubble collapsed, falling inward.  It sank into her skin, and she crashed to the floor.  The light disappeared into her, and was gone.  
<br><br>
  She lifted her head.  Her eyes burned, glowing silver orbs of light.  Gnolls howled, turned to flee, and then simply… vanished.   The Shaman fell into the rift in the floor with a cry. 
<br><br>
   "Thus do I avenge my violated sanctuary."  Her voice echoed off the walls like crystal chimes.  She rose slowly to her feet.  Her hair rippled out from her head as though carried on a breeze, though the air was still and quiet.  Anthiel came toward her, reached out a hand.  Her gaze fell on him, and he stopped in his tracks.  "She loves you," Aklar's face smiled with infinite caring and tenderness.  "Carry that in your heart."
<br><br>
   "Goddess," Te'Anara took a stumbling step forward.  "Forgive us…"
<br><br>
   "My child," the Goddess came across the walkway, reached out with Aklar's hand.  Te'Anara knelt before her, head bowed.  "No blame for this.  It was written, as you know well.  You have served me faithfully."  Te'Anara began to weep, as the Goddess touched her gently on the head.
<br><br>
   "Where… what has happened to Aklar?"  Freygar faltered.
<br><br>
   "She is here," the Goddess said, laying hand to heart.  "She lives still."  
<br><br>
   "But not for long."  
<br><br>
   It was D'anok, struggling to his feet, eyes fixed on her.  "You are finished, Great Mother," he laughed terribly.  "My master has waited long and long for this day."   She turned slowly to him, her clothes drifting, a light growing in the air about her.
<br><br>
   "Do you not know the price he will make you pay?  Oh ignorant one."  Love and pity, even for him, could be seen on her face.  "You have come to your death."
<br><br>
   "You are the one who will die today, Goddess.  Say farewell to your foolish followers.  Innoruk!" he cried out loud.  "Yag norothmei getnak forooth!"  
<br><br>
    The air itself darkened, the floor rang like a gong.  Druids and Rangers alike were tossed off their feet. Freygar and Anthiel clung to one another like children.  The Goddess stood, unmoved.
<br><br>
   "He comes!" the Dark Elf cried in ecstasy.   Then his face changed, and he had one moment to realize and to know fear.
<br><br>
   A bolt of black lightning flashed down from the ceiling, transfixing D'anok.  He screamed terribly.  An explosion of dark burst out of him, reached writhing tendrils out in every direction, then reversed and sucked back in, doubling him over.  
<br><br>
   He slowly straightened, lifting his head.  Where his eyes had been were now pits of dark red flame.  His flesh writhed, rising in ridges over his cheekbones and forehead, his hands curling into twisted claws.
<br><br>
   "You abuse your servants, Innoruk," said the Goddess voice turned to clear ice.
<br><br>
   "And you coddle yours," D'anok's voice too, had changed, his musical baritone corrupted, rasping.  
<br><br>
   "I safeguard them, dark one.  In whatever form you drive me to, I will not abandon my children."   Her silver eyes flared.   The Dark God laughed.
<br><br>
   "Come then, if you dare."  He spread his arms wide.  "It is time for a God to die."
