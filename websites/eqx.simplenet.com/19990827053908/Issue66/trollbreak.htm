Renthiel struggled to clear his head.  The pain, instead of focusing his thoughts, was dragging him perilously close to unconsciousness.   He couldn't let that happen though.  Ever since he was captured and beaten, he had hung on desperately to avoid losing consciousness.  His meager few spells would disappear from memory the moment he gave in.  He could not let that happen.  Not while his troll captors held his precious spell book... if they hadn't destroyed it already.
<br><br>
Not daring to even move, he lay hunched back against the damp stone wall of his cell, his half-closed eyes tracking the troll guard that paced nearby.  In his mind he kept going over the minor spell of healing that he had memorised, silently torturing himself, knowing he could not risk casting it while the guard was close.  Renthiel knew very little of the troll culture, but he did know that their shamans were revered and feared by the general population.  It would only hasten his death were they to see him cast a spell of any kind.  He only hoped they wouldn't recognise his spell book for what it was.
<br><br>
After what seemed an eternity, the guard finally wandered out of the room, but for how long, Renthiel didn't know.  He wasted no time in softly chanting the healing spell under his breath, bracing himself in anticipation of the cool healing magic that would wash over him.  A bright blue light radiated out from his hands, filling the cell, and he felt his wounds close, and his bruises disappear.
<br><br>
As the spell died down, two things were revealed in the light it had produced.  The first was a shadowy figure hidden in the corner of Renthiel's cell.  The second was the guard returning to his post.  Renthiel could feel his heart pounding, as the guard peered suspiciously at him through the bars.  He avoided the guard's gaze, feeling the sweat drip down his neck, wondering if he'd just given himself away.   But the guard had obviously seen little more than a vague glimpse of blue light, and soon returned to his pacing.  Renthiel relaxed slightly, shifting to a more comfortable position.
<br><br>
Trying to appear nonchalant, he turned his head slightly in the direction of the figure he'd seen.  To his amazement, nothing was there but dark shadow.  Losing all pretence of casualness, Renthiel stared openly at the corner of the cell, wondering if the beating was causing him to see things that weren't there.  For several minutes he stared, searching carefully each pool of shadows in the cell, but found nothing.  The only other person he saw, besides the guard, was the froglock prisoner in the cell opposite his.  He had just given up on finding anything, when a movement in the corner caught his attention.  Renthiel jumped involuntarily, backing away a short distance.  Where there had been nothing a few moments ago, was a dark hooded figure.
<br><br>
Renthiel waited a few moments for the figure to say something, but it remained silent.  Finally Renthiel could contain himself no longer.  "Hello?" he said, his voice no more than a whisper.  "My name is Renthiel.  I am a cleric.  I know not how you come to be here, or who you are, but perhaps if we work together we can find a means of escape.  Our captors don't know it, but I have a few spells in memory.  If we use them at the right time they may aid in our escape."
<br><br>
The hooded figure was silent a few moments, before leaning forward into the light.  Renthiel saw a glimpse of blue skin and recoiled.  The figure pulled the hood back, revealing the cold, hard stare of a Tier'dal.  Even more disconcerting was the hard smile he offered Renthiel.
<br><br>
"Does my appearance frighten you?" asked the dark elf in a soft voice, the smile twisting in scorn.
<br><br>
"No..." Renthiel lied.  "I was merely startled.  I thought your kind was allied with the trolls."
 <br><br>
"Allies?" the dark elf said, almost spitting out the word.  "These creatures are too far beneath us to be true allies.  They have their uses however, and we put them to those uses."
<br><br>
"May I know your name," Renthiel asked.
<br><br>
 "You would not understand it in my native tongue.  In the crude common tongue that your race is so fond of, I am known as Vayer."
<br><br>
"Tell me, Vayer.  Why are you here? If these savages are so far beneath you, how come you to be one of their prisoners?"
<br><br>
Vayer's eyes came together threateningly.  "That is my business, and you'd do well to stay clear of it.  Save any of that human pity you may have for yourself, and waste it not on me.  I am in no danger here.  Even these savages know that it would be a mistake for them to harm even one Tier'dal.  You on the other hand... you they will enjoy killing.  Carver Cagrek is very good at what he does."
<br><br>
Renthiel found his throat had gone dry.  "Who is Carver Cagrek?" he asked, trying to keep the stammer out of his voice.
<br><br>
Vayer smiled cruelly.  "If you were conscious you would have seen him on the way in.  He was the one busy carving up that dwarf tied between the two posts.  Well, carving up what was left of the dwarf.  You can rest assured that his title of Carver is a well earned one."
<br><br>
Renthiel felt like he was about to throw up.  He had indeed seen the grisly sight earlier.  But whatever was tied between the posts had lost any semblance of its original form.  He was horrified to hear that it had once been a dwarf.  He muttered a quick prayer to Mithaniel Marr under his breath to save him from such a fate.
<br><br>
Vayer leant forward, his eyes inquiring.  "Tell me, what brings a cleric of the Truthbringer to Grobb?  What truth is it that you seek here?"
<br><br>
Renthiel looked slightly abashed.  "I was travelling through the desert on a pilgrimage, when these trolls captured me."
<br><br>
Renthiel was startled by the harsh laughter of the dark elf.  It wasn't a very pleasant laugh, and had little to do with true mirth.  "You humans are fools.  You vainly worship your pompous god, and think that nothing can stand in your way.  Tell me human... what can your god do for you now? Will he turn the blade of Carver Cagrek so that you remain unharmed?"
<br><br>
Renthiel bristled at the dark elf's words.  "And the Prince of Hate is a more suitable god? A god who cares naught for his people except when they can serve to cause pain and misery in his name?"
<br><br>
"I do not follow Innoruuk," Vayer said.  "My brethren would follow him blindly, but I prefer a more profitable god.  Bristlebane is a lot less... shall we say harsh on his followers."
<br><br>
This time it was Renthiel's turn to laugh, and he did not even attempt to keep the scorn out of his voice.  "You're a thief," he said.  "A common thief.  There's no need to tell me why you're a prisoner here now.  Your kind often find themselves in accommodation of this sort.  The details themselves are unimportant."
<br><br>
Vayer leant forward, his expression menacing.  "Do not anger me, human.  My motives may be less pure than my brethren, who would kill you as soon as look at you in the name of their god of hate, but I am still far more dangerous than anyone you will likely meet in your pitiful life.  Already I grow tired of our conversation.  Do not push me further."
<br><br>
Renthiel seemed oblivious to the danger in the dark elf's words.  "Help me escape," he whispered urgently.  "Together we have a chance, where alone we would certainly fail."
<br><br>
The dark elf dismissed his words with a shake of his head, and returned once more to the shadows.  "I have no need to escape.  In a few days a Tier'dal ambassador will come here and secure my release.  My punishment in Neriak will be a light one.  I have little to gain and much to lose."
<br><br>
"Little to gain? Surely your freedom is worth the risk.  Your punishment may not be harsh, but I daresay it would involve some form of imprisonment."
<br><br>
Vayer appeared once more from out of the shadows, his expression one of scorn.  "And how would you propose we get out of this cell, and then get by the entire troll community waiting outside this jail?"
<br><br>
Renthiel looked excitedly at the dark elf.  "When you hide like that in the shadows... does it affect the trolls too? Or only those without infravision?"
<br><br>
"No Tier'dal can be seen when he doesn't want to be.  I can hide easily enough.  But it does little to help when I'm stuck inside this cell.  What is your plan? I assume you have one or you wouldn't be pestering me."
<br><br>
Renthiel smiled grimly and nodded.  "Listen closely, and I'll tell you exactly how we can escape."
<br><br>

Basher Banzuk scratched himself absently as he stared into the cell.  Like Carver Cagrek, his title was also a well-earned one.  Bashing things, especially the froggies that inhabited the swamp, was his favorite past time.  Having to stand guard however, was not something he enjoyed.  It was too passive.  And besides, it involved more thought than bashing things, and thinking was something he had a lot of trouble with.  Even at that moment he was deep in thought... well as deep as he could go when he really concentrated.  Which really wasn't much at all.  Banzuk knew little of the science of mathematics.  Even using his stubby fingers did little to aid him.  He was fine right up until he reached one.  It was after that, that he had problems.  And right now, he was having trouble counting.
<br><br>
Banzuk peered into the cell with the weak human.  Several times he pointed at the pitiful creature, while mouthing the word "one" under his breath.  But each time he stopped short after that, and scratched his head.  He couldn't remember if there were supposed to be more prisoners in there or not.  He found himself peering into the shadows, looking for any sign of another prisoner.  But he found nothing.  Still, there was something nagging at him, hinting that something wasn't quite right.  But just when he thought he would remember, enlightenment would elude him.  Frustrated, he growled menacingly at the human prisoner, waving his short-sword at him.  He smiled in satisfaction at the look of terror the prisoner gave him.
<br><br>
This scene played out several times during the next few hours, until night fell.  Banzuk was growing even more restless, and was eager to finish his shift.  When he heard the human call out to him, he was irritated at being disturbed, and planned on showing the prisoner just how good he was at bashing.  The human was pressed back against the cell's stone wall.  As Banzuk approached, he saw the prisoner move his hands in a strange pattern and mumble words the troll could not understand.  A moment later there was a flash of light, and Banzuk felt pain lash out at it him.  Roaring with rage, the troll practically ripped the door off its hinges in his attempt to reach the cause of his pain.  As he entered the cell, the human once more began to chant and move his hands.  Banzuk braced himself for the pain, ready this time to shrug it aside as he bashed the impudent human into a bloody pulp.  But instead of pain, he suddenly found that everything had gone dark.  Trolls normally have excellent night vision, but Banzuk found he couldn't see a thing.  Hurt, angered, and now blinded, the troll began to thrash around, while bellowing at his unseen attackers.
<br><br>
A soft voice in the darkness brought to mind what Banzuk had forgotten.  There had been a dark elf rogue in the cell as well.  "Do something quickly," the voice said, "or we'll have every troll in town in here with us."
<br><br>
"I'm trying," said another voice.  The human this time.  The one who would pay for the hurt he'd caused.  A moment later he heard the human chanting again.  Suddenly Banzuk felt a lethargy fall over him.  His anger seemed to vanish, and he dropped his arms to his side, and his voice fell silent.  He just stood there a moment longer, before another form of blackness enveloped him, this time caused by a blow to the head.  Banzuk was out cold before he hit the floor.
<br><br>

Renthiel and Vayer hunched down near the jail exit.  The troll guard lay unconscious in their former cell. 
<br><br>
"What was that last spell?" Vayer asked, his voice little more than a whisper.
<br><br>
"It was just a minor lull spell," the cleric said.  "It only lasts a few seconds.  I was glad it didn't need to last any longer than it did."
<br><br>
Vayer nodded grimly.  "Very well, human.  You have fulfilled your part of the bargain.  I have no love for your people, but I do have honor.  I will now fulfill my part of the plan.  But remember... once we leave the swamp, our pact ends.  I would advise you to stay well clear of me from that moment on."
<br><br>
"I understand," Renthiel said, his voice cold.
<br><br>
Vayer nodded once more.  "Remain here until I make my move.  Head directly for the exit to the swamp, and then bear right.  Are you clear on where the exit is?"  Renthiel nodded in the darkness.  "Very well then.  Don't stop for any reason.  I will catch up to you as soon as I am able and lead you out."
 <br><br>
Without another word, Vayer moved silently out into the large open area outside the jail.  Renthiel had kept his eye on the dark elf as he left, but he seemed to vanish completely, swallowed up by the darkness.  Renthiel settled in to wait, his eyes darting left and right following any troll that came into view, hoping he would not be discovered.
<br><br>
The minutes began to drag by, and the cleric was growing more and more certain that the dark elf had failed, and was even now dead.  Just as he was about to give up hope, a loud cry shattered the stillness of the night.  The effect it had on the trolls nearby was instantaneous.  Every one of them ran towards a nearby corridor, heading in the direction the cry had come from.  Renthiel waited a few moments longer before running madly from his hiding place heading for another corridor in the opposite direction.  The directions the dark elf had given him were accurate, and Renthiel quickly made his way through the seemingly deserted troll city, arriving at the entrance without being discovered.  Another stone corridor gave way to the walls of a canyon, and beyond that, the Innothule Swamp.  Twice Renthiel had to avoid the trolls who patrolled near the swamp entrance, but luck was on his side, and he soon found himself turning right, and splashing his way through the murky swamp.
<br><br>
Renthiel was unsure just how long he'd been running, when he heard the first sounds of pursuit.  He had barely managed to hide behind a fallen tree, when he saw the hooded figure of Vayer come into view.  The dark elf was limping slightly, and Renthiel could see he was wounded.  In his right hand, there was a bloodied dagger.  Renthiel stepped out from hiding, and quickly cast his only healing spell on the dark elf.
<br><br>
"There's no time for that, " the dark elf said snarling.  "I had to kill two trolls as I doubled back to make my escape.  Already they've taken up the chase.  We have a good head start but no time to waste.  Follow me, and don't tarry."
<br><br>
With that, Vayer began to run once more through the rancid water, not even looking back to see if the cleric followed.  Renthiel hurriedly followed, just managing to keep the fleeing dark elf in sight.  For what seemed like an eternity the tired cleric ran through the swamp.  So intent was he on putting one foot in front of the other, and not falling, that he failed to see the creature that appeared in front of him.  Renthiel yelled in surprise, and stumbled back a few steps. It was a froglock.
<br><br>
The froglock's first instinct seemed to be to attack, and it raised its sword threateningly at the frightened cleric.  A moment later the froglock lowered its weapon, surprise showing on its face at the sight of a human in the swamp.  The creature made a strange noise, as it stared curiously at Renthiel.   Renthiel smiled at the creature, feeling that the danger had passed.  Looking around though, he couldn't see Vayer.  Panic enveloped him for a moment, before he decided to turn to the froglock for help.
<br><br>
"Can you show me the way out?" he asked, speaking slowly, not knowing whether it could even understand common.  The froglock responded with what Renthiel guessed was a smile, and it nodded quickly at him.  Relief flooded through Renthiel, and he was about to urge the creature to hurry, when a strange expression crossed the froglock's face.  It stood there for a moment, before giving a small cry and falling lifelessly into a heap at Renthiel's feet.  The dark figure of Vayer materialized in front of him, his dagger still dripping with the blood of the fallen froglock.
<br><br>
Renthiel felt rage well up inside him.  "There was no need to do that," he said, practically spitting the words at the dark elf.  "He would not have harmed me.  There was no need to kill him."
<br><br>
Vayer regarded him coolly for a moment.  "Don't ever question me, human.  Our deal was for me to lead you out of the swamp once you freed me from the cell.  The exit is only a short distance ahead.  I suggest, you save any preaching you might be contemplating, and follow behind me."  With that, he turned and once more began to run through the swamp.  A few moments later, Renthiel followed after him.
<br><br>
The dark elf was true to his word, and a few minutes later, Renthiel found himself following the winding canyon that led to the desert outside.  Once the swamp was left behind them, Renthiel found himself facing the dark elf, on the edge of the desert.
<br><br>
"Here we part company," the dark elf said coldly.  "I trust you will not be foolish enough to follow me."
<br><br>
"Why did you kill that creature?" Renthiel asked, his rage rising up once more.  "There was no need.  It's almost like you enjoy killing.  I thought that after all we'd just been through..."
<br><br>
"You thought what?" Vayer asked, scorn lacing each word.  "That we would travel Norrath together?  That we would become friends? Is that how foolish your thoughts have been?"
<br><br>
Renthiel felt his face turn red.  "I... I... don't know.  Together we worked well, and managed to escape from within the troll city itself."
<br><br>
"Run back to your temple, " Vayer said, his voice like ice.  "Already I grow tired of your company.  Our pact is complete.  Begone before the trolls find you again."
<br><br>
Renthiel waited where he was a few moments, and watched as the dark elf ran off into the desert.  Shaking his head sadly to himself, he began the long journey northwards, his thoughts already turning to the peace he would find in the temple's marble halls.
