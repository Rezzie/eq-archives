	<big><big>T</big></big>he reason people PKed in UO was that once you hit the skill cap the <b>only</b> way to get ahead of other players was resources. The only measure of greatness for your character or guild was if you had a tower blocked off by three tents or a castle blocked off by a smithy, training center and pickpocket's den. Do you have 250 of each reagent in the bank or do you have thousands of each reagent? Material wealth was the only measure of power and players carried around a lot of it so they were attractive targets. Also, in UO the risk vs. reward of PKing was very unbalanced. If you died once for every 10 people you killed or even every 2 people you killed you still ended up ahead. 
<br><br>
In EQ things will be much different. Items are a distant second to level in measuring power. In EQ if you die once for every two people you kill you will end up in horrible condition. Each death you loose XP which is far more valuable than equipment. By the time you get all the XP back you'd probably have collected that same about of wealth off the monsters you killed. Even if the ratio is 1:5 or 1:10 it's still not worth it once you have 6 or 7 decent sets of equipment as back up.

Why try to get a 50th set of backup equipment when you risk loosing 5-10% (I hope the penalty is at LEAST this high) of your XP? Say you've spent 100 total hrs killing MOBs for XP. Is another set of plate and maybe a magical weapon worth 5 hrs of your time? In five hrs of hunting you'd probably get that much stuff AND get XP.
<br><br>
The other thing that is a motivation for PKing is fame. How must it feel to be a "Thumper" or a "Magical Bubba"? Even being a "Salazar" or an "Og" would be great. Looking back at it now, the beginning of the end of my stay in UO was probably the day I saw my character's name on one of those "Most Wanted" web pages. One of my guild-mates told me about the sight and I rushed over. There it was: "Lord of the Flies" on a list with about 40 other names. It was alphabetical so I'm not sure how close to "number one" I was (probably pretty far) but it didn't matter. I was infamous. Many of the PKs I knew would message GMs asking how many kills they had and kept a collection of skulls in vendors to show the world how great they were. Looking back it was all quite pointless.  Any one of them could be defeated on a bad day.

Now imagine what it would take to become that famous in EQ. Killing players by the score isn't going to do it. If you are some 10th level Shadow knight who collected 30 ears in one weekend without dyeing that's great. You probably have a very good grasp of the game and are an excellent tactician. If I'm a 17th level Paladin though I could care less. I'd probably kick the crap out of you in a one on one fight. To get a "reputation" in EQ you will have be 2 things: very high level and, to a lesser extent, a good Role Player. High level because power and fame go hand in and a good Role Player so people remember you after an encounter. Having a short, easy to remember name probably helps also ;p. Not that when I say "Role Player" it does not mean talking in old English. It means having your own style and some class. In this case Role Playing an inner city ghetto dweller, though out of place in the fantasy setting, does just as well as playing a maniacal Necromancer. I doubt rampant Pkers will get much fame or respect in EQ. A deadly assassin who spends lots of time leveling but is known to accept jobs if the price is right, on the other hand, will be feared by all. Perhaps the occasional random killing for advertisement wouldn't hurt either.
