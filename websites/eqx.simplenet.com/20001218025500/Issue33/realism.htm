As a long time GM (in paper and dice games, for those of you that remember them) my games were always popular partly because, and I quote, "you don't goof around with any of the bullshit.  You're pure."  Some stranger who observed one of my games at BuboniCon told this to me in a truly touching moment (sniff!).  I regularly fed off of similar positive comments from my players, mostly praising how difficult, rewarding and realistic my scenarios were.
<br><br>
<em>Hooold up there, you Gary Gygax wannabe</em>, you think.  <em>Time out.  REALISM?  In a FANTASY game?  What the hell does that mean?  It's FANTASY, it isn't real life!  Are draaaaagons REAL?  Huh?  Is maaaaagic REAL?  Huh?  If it's all a GAME, and it isn't REAL to begin with, how can there be REALISM?  Huh?  Explain THAT.</em>
<br><br>
(Rolling my eyes) Oh, for crying out lou - very well.  I was intending this editorial to be a self-congratulatory monument to my inflated ego, but very well.
<br><br>
Any game, by definition, has rules.  The simpler the rules, the more variations are possible.  Consider Go, Checkers or Chess.  While these games are easy to learn, the countless variations and maneuvers within these rules allow for the differences between a Bobby Fisher and a…. well…. me.
<br><br>
Now consider most Fantasy RPG systems.  Where you could explain the rules of Go on a 3x5 card in large print, most Fantasy RPG systems have <em>volumes</em> dedicated to outlining the boundaries of the game.  Most questions or situations a player could conceive of are answered within these rules.  With perhaps small adjustments (say, the spell points variation in AD&D) these rules are mutually agreed upon before a group sits down to play.  There is a <em>common reference</em> (the written rules) to play the game by, and a <em>referee</em> (the GM, or a separate Referee in tournaments) to handle disputes.  Very similar to other games and sports.
<br><br>
Where Fantasy RPG's part ways with other games is <b><em>context.</b></em>  Where most games have clear objectives, Fantasy RPGs leave it up to the GM and players to create the surrounding context wherein the game will be played.  Not just the characters and the methods, but the very world itself is up to our devices.  The system may make suggestions (pre-designed modules and cities for the creativity-challenged) but mostly it's up to us.
<br><br>
How does one go about creating context?  What's our reference point?
<br><br>
Well, when a chess player wishes to improve his game, he studies the masters.  So, to some degree, do we.  We study the "masters" of Fantasy; people who have imagined Fantasy worlds and situations within them, and shared their findings with us.  The writers.
<br><br>
Naturally, not all who write Fantasy are masters.  Far from it.  In a genre where you can make your own rules, there are many who make no rules at all.  Their Fantasy worlds have no internal consistency, no depth, and are littered with super-heroes and super-villains performing ridiculous feats in ridiculous situations.  These "authors" "create" "worlds" with few rules, then proceed to break them on a regular basis.  They may call their books Fantasy, but intelligent readers call them what they are: Children's Books.
<br><br>
The true Fantasy writers, <em>and Fantasy gamers</em>, create suspension-of-disbelief in a Fantasy world by:
<br><br>
1) Setting believable rules <em>in a Fantasy contex</em>t, and<br>
2) Having their characters live and triumph <em>within those rules</em>.
<br><br>
If the characters in a Fantasy book can break the rules at will, the reader feels cheated.  Why would we care about a hero who has this ability?  He is not a hero, he's a deity!  He needn't struggle against the forces of evil if he can simply snap his fingers and bend reality- even a fantastic, magical reality- to his will.  How can we empathize with a character that has no limits, no restrictions, no <em>rules</em>?  Where's the fun, I ask you?  WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT?
<br><br>
Even in a Fantasy setting, there is an internal logic.  Magic has limits, and its power comes from somewhere.  The arcane arts are complex; most powerful wizards are extremely intelligent (if not always as wise).  Dragons are not common creatures, and are fearsome in battle.  Random killers of people are hunted and destroyed.
<br><br>
Things still happen for a reason, and actions have consequences.
<br><br>
Transfer this logic into a Fantasy RPG setting.  In my experience as a GM and as a player, games that had no rules were simply no fun.  The "victories" held no triumph, the "defeats" no remorse.  GMs and players who played Fantasy RPGs this way were labeled "Monty Hallers" because the games offered no challenge and no real reward.  I proudly admit having been a snob about this, and these people were scoffed at in my circles.  Rules and limits are realistic; the tougher a game is to win, the more fun it is to win it.
<br><br>
Just as books without rules are Children's Books, games without rules are exactly that: Children's Games.
