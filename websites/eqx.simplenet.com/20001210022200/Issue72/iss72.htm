We are planning to do an 'all roleplaying' issue very soon.  If you have an article about how to roleplay, or what makes roleplaying fun, or something along those lines, or any suggestions about what you think we should cover, please send it in right away.  We hope to do this for Issue 75.  Also, please send us your art.  Now that all of the other sites are asking for featured art, it seems that we don't get any.  That makes me sad, and keeps Archanalia real busy.  So please, send in your art.

My Ambition has long been dead.

Who hath slain it, I could not tell.  It's not as if I was born with one hand curled around a bottle and the other fondling the breast of some ripe barfly.  I recall the deeds of my early youth involving great travails of distance and ideas I'd now think seemingly impossible to achieve.

A necromancer born was I, so trade was difficult.  I searched high and low, but could not find a pole and bait to fish with.  Then word reached me that on the island in Erud's crossing existed an inhabitance of cat-like creatures.  These were simple creatures, so I was told, and didn't mind dealing with necromancers.  I had to see this.

<b>First Entry</b>
<br><br>
Today I became a man. I am now a Warrior of the Wolves. What will I do with my life? It is up to me now. Today I set forth on a long journey. My destination is yet unclear, but honor and strength will lead me. 
<br><br>
When I awakened in Halas this morning, I decided to join the other young Warriors and Shamans near the cave entrance, to test my mettle and develop my warrior skills by battling the many beasts that roam the Everfrost Peaks. I quickly discovered that I have much to learn! Even the weakest of foes, such as goblin whelps, are dangerous to me. I have a chance against them one on one, only, and I need to stay close to the guards so that they can help me if I get in over my head. I do not feel worthy of the title Warrior. Today I ran from battle, humiliated by a wooly spiderling. This is not good. I hope that no one saw me.

I'm hiding in my mother's dining room.  I'm supposed to be keeping my eyes on her since she is recovering from bypass surgery, but I can't take it in there anymore.  It's not mom, it's daytime television!  I actually watched an entire scene from some soap opera where Jamie Farr (you know, Clinger from MASH) played a guardian angel for some young woman<b>...</b>
