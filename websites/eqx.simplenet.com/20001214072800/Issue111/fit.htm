Hoi there! Lrets D'pearl here with the latest an' greatest in news across the lands of Norrath. Well... today brings me to good ol' sunny Freeport... (Me new home BTW... if'n ye have an uncontrollable need to hunt me down for an autograph :P) to tell ye the latest in fun an' frolicking that the good, an' might I add not the least bit corrupt &lt; coughbullsh**cough&gt; Freeport Council have provided for the good people that dwell in the deserts. 
<br><br>
It seems that the petrification spell that went awry <a href="../Issue98/fit.htm">awhiles back</a>  also hit a poor hapless Orc that was attempting to infiltrate the Academy at the time the spell went off. Well... lemme tell ye! The city sure went up in a tizzy as to what to do with this, literally petrified Orc. Rumors have it that this Orc owed well known Mob-boss... errrrr... I mean philanthropist, Peetza the Hut (Yeesh! It's amazing how ye'r adjectives and pronouns can change when ye'v got a big Troll named GOO-Wee-Do pointing a big ol' crossbow at ye'r head ... BUT I digress). In any case... rumor had it that the poor Orc owed Peetza a good sum of money, and Peetza wanted to have the Orc so he could use him as his favorite decoration in his desert palace. Fortunately, especially for the sensibilities of all interior decorators, Freeport officials did not allow this. Instead, the Freeport Council decided that they would make this Orc something which could provide a benefit in some way to the citizens of Freeport. So...

(<em>Freeports newest fun attraction... the Petrified Orc Desert Plat (or Platform... depending on whether ye know the local slang) Springboard!! Fun for people of ALL ages! Come take a dive an' leap into the warm relaxing sands (Yes! I said sands) of Northern Ro!!</em>) 
<p style="text-align: justify">
Now we have Freeport's newest attraction. The Petrified Orc Springboard... that now lets ye dive into another miracle provided by those clever mages at the Academy of Arcane Sciences... the Northern Ro Sand Pools! Now for only three sp's ye can take a dive off the Northern Ro Platform (otherwise known as the "Plat" to locals) into this new sand pool. Imagine... ye take a swim in the nice an' toasty sands of Northern Ro... an' ye don't even get wet!! MY word... we haven't had anything this revolutionary since the Swim simulator developed by the BB Gnolls' water park!!

(<em>A Freeport local enjoys a nice swim in the SANDS of Northern Ro... looks fun!!</em>) 
<p style="text-align: justify">
So ... hop on to the next ferry or caravan to Freeport an' check out this new attraction... but beware!! Make sure that ye rest at least 20 minutes after eating before ye take a dive. Apparently some Trolls dinna think about this an' dove in right after eating, and as a result suffered from some mighty awful cramps for days afterwards.

<p style="text-align: justify">
Well that's it for today... see ye all next week. Until then... This is Lrets D'pearl Aspiring Bard Extraordinaire and Cub Reporter who is impatiently waiting for 20 minutes to pass so he can take a dive... Signing off!! :)
