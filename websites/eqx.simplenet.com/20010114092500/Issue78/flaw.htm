Different game, same old problems. The power gamers think role players are a bunch of idiots. The role players wish those who don't get it would get lost. The jerks continue to be jerks out to ruin everyone fun. Why is it that unlike other genres RPG's seem to attract an incredibly divergent population that co-exists at best, despise each other at worst?
<br><br>
I've been doing this online thing for quite some time now. Though the game changes, the archetypes seem to always remain the same. There is the person who wants to win the game by getting the most powerful items, the highest skills, and the most money. Then there is the person who is just on for the fun. They don't really care about the environment itself, they are just relaxing and seeing the sights. Kind of like having a beer after work to wind down. Next are the people out to make your life miserable. The get a charge or rush from their immature antics. Whether they are Kill Stealers or Pkers it doesn't matter. These are the people that have fun when you aren't. Finally there are the people like me. I want to participate in a story. I would like to accompany Frodo to Mount Doom. Or join Arthur and Galahad in their quest for the Grail. Or stand next to Thomas and Pug during the Riftwar.
<br><br>
Where did I get this strange desire to participate in a fantasy from? Well it all started when I was ten, and the 'sitter' brought over this new thing called Dungeons and Dragons. I could let my imagination soar as my friends and I defeated the evil Dragon and were proclaimed heroes of the realm. It was pure escapism. At first it was get the best widget and kill the foo. Slowly my motivation for playing changed. I was exercising my imagination along the traditions of a vocal oratory reliving a myth as Homer and Shakespeare would share it with their audience. Except I was an actor in this myth instead of a viewer. This ability to participate in a story was one of the most fun things I could have possibly imagined. Even better than those silly 'Choose your own adventure' books.
<br><br>
With this expectation in mind, I wandered into the online arena with similar expectations. Imagine my surprise when I found that only some of the people shared my views. Worse, some were more concerned with ruining my experience whatever the cost. I put up with bugs and player killers and harassment. So I moved on. Eventually I landed here, in EverQuest.
<br><br>
Why this game? Well to put it bluntly, Verant made all the right noises. High Fantasy names only. Guilds that would be explicitly linked to Norrath. Guide driven quests! In essence, an environment that would actively promote role playing. Well, it turns out that Verant over stated their case. But I don't mind really. Why? Because of the people I have met. It IS possible to have a truly immersive experience in this game. One simply has to know where to look. And get lucky. 
<br><br>
So what do I hope to see in the future of EverQuest? My greatest fantasy would be Verant seizing the proverbial bull by the horns and create an official IC only server, much like they have with Rallos Zek and inter player conflict. Create an environment where consistent OOC behavior would be petitionable. While it would be beholden on the EverQuest community to police themselves on this, why would the guy out for a beer even be interested? Since we all have different styles of play, why not acknowledge this fact and allow for a segregation of play styles instead of forcing us all into one big incompatible soup?
<br><br>
I would also love to see some changes, perhaps on an IC server, perhaps throughout the entire game. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm not a big fan of the concept of a switch. While it is necessary because of some of the 'wonderful' people out there, I'd really like to play a follower of Rodecet Nife, meet a Tier'dal of Innoruuk, and kick the spittle out of them while telling them they should repent their evil ways. I really hope that any IC server would allow for religious PvP conflict. Further, there should be encouragement for role playing. In another game the powers that be declared an experience bonus for everyone 'caught' role playing. You can't force role playing on people, nor should you try. But you can encourage it strongly. If this game is truly a role playing game, then I would think that Verant would be trying everything possible to encourage that style of play, as opposed to declaring role play 'Indefinable'.
<br><br>
Is role playing doomed in the online arena? No. Not if the powers that be give us the tools to get together and role play. Until that time we will simply be forced to muddle along as we have been, perhaps hoping the next big thing will deliver, or that EverQuest will evolve from it's admittedly very good current state. I'd really like to meet more of you that role play on different servers. I'd love to run into a bunch of tree hugging Druids like Brennos Oakkeep, or encounter the role players on Erolisi Maar. But until the day we can all agree on one server or Verant declares server X as the IC server, Negak will continue to sing about bashing halflings and Ahtenret will preach about the destruction of all things evil on Karana. Not to mention the odd couple of characters I have floating around on Fennin Ro.
<br><br>
The bottom line is this: have fun. It's a game so don't let the little things get you down. EverQuest is in my opinion the best graphical MUD yet. Is it perfect? No. I think all of us can come up with a host of improvements and changes that we feel will significantly improve the game. My personal favorite is the IC server idea while some think the characters need further balancing. But one thing we all need to remember if someone's play style annoys you then just move along. I'll do my best to stay out of your hair, all I ask is that your reciprocate. Or, to quote from yesteryear: 'All you little children play nice now…'
