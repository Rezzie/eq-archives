[Ed. - Well, after all of this trouble, we think we've found our new Ask columnist.  She's tall, she's beautiful and well spoken.  She has many of the qualities that we miss with the departure of dear Auntie Moog.  And she managed to ferret out that sneaky Dark Elf and chase him from our offices.  Once we move to <b>another</b> undisclosed location in Freeport, things should be back to their more reasonable levels of chaos.  So please welcome Oxesiess Bashy to EverQuest Express.]

<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
What is this obsession with races in Everquest? Isn't judging critters by the color of their skin wrong? How can Paladins get away with it or any creatures that deem themselves "good?" Why isn't there an outcry from players about this? And don't *even* get me started about the racial scores! What about the merchents who refuse to sell to players because they're dark elves? If Trolls can be ShadowKnights and cast Necro spells, why couldn't a young Troll choose to be an enchanter--or to be different to be a true Paladin--one who realizes it's whats in a person's heart that's important, not the color of their skin! Peace!

See one day I's seen a polar bear cub, and it done run up and tried to smack da snot outta me.  Welpers you thinky I's jist gonna stand der takin dat?  Heck NO!  I tell ya's, firsted I's whipped out me Sword and DEN I kicked it and DEN I's a started a swinging and stuff.  And da blood and guts were flyin EVERYWHERE!  Den I's gotted *really* worked up and I's done zerked...  like dis..
<br><br>
AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYIiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaa!!!<br>
KILL KILL BASH BASH
<br><br>
Afore I's knew what was goin on...  no more polar bear cub.  Jist tiny itty witty pieces all over.  I thinky bout ten or so unless I missed some dat flew really far off.
<br><br>
And..  errr...  ahh... so ta answer da question, I was jist a young Bashy then.  Now ya's can't even count da pieces!

<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
 As a Dark Elf and a Shadownight, I would just like to say that I enjoy reading the teachings of hate. It is good that we have a Dark Brother spreading our word, to the uncivilized Light Dwellers of the Land.

<br><br><b>
Oh bah!  PLUEASE!  Oh hate dis and spreadin da hate... until dis stuff can beat out Roasted-Mammoth-on-da-Stick I thinky...
<br><br>
I's need ta go back home fer lunch, these muffin's aren't cuttin it.  Not enough grisle I tell ya's.
</b><br><br><br>

<em>Dark brother,
<br><br>
As you stand amongst our kind as a devout denizen of hate, I come to you with a simple matter I hope you can clarify for me.  I embrace hatred as the true path to ascension over the light dwellers.  Yet, if hatred is the pinnacle of Innoruuk's path, does it not suggest we are to spread hatred amongst ourselves?  How do I reconcile the pride and admiration I hold for my dark brothers and sisters, if such is truth?  Fare nothing of finding a bold and handsome male who catches my affections...
