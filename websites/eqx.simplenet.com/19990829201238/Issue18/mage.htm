Over the last while there have been some theories forming about the
different magic professions and which will be better at what tasks. I
gave some thought to this and by using the classic dividing lines
between schools I formed a theory about mages, and came up with an
interesting idea about magic combat. Not so much mages in combat, but
more so mages in combat with each other.

In every game in the past a huge portion of the killing power has laid
upon the magic using party member once at high levels. Now in recent
past in online games this makes for a twist in the Player Killing Arena,
where magic is almost absolutely king of the Cobras. I think that
EverQuest's magic system brings an innovation in where Asheron's Call
fails so far by design. While AC has the infinite spell creation system
that makes for very cool spells, I highly doubt that AC has 4 to 6 magic
using professions with unique spell lists.

This argument leads to "which is the best magic class in combat then?"
Well, assuming that there are no balancing issues that are left
unsolved, there should be a few different answers. 
<br><br>
Wizards seem to be the kings of contemporary mage combat, having the
most power in a head-on battle against any single magic using opponent,
plus the spells of travel which may or may not be useful in a fight.
Classically known as Invocation in AD&D and other games, it often deals
with area of effect damaging spells and some awesome single target
spells. I see the Wizards also having a share of utility and defending
spells, which makes them overall the most straight forward killing
machines in the game.
