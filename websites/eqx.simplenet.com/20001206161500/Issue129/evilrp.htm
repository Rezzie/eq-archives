  Evil in a MMORPG</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I spent my time 
  in EverQuest playing a Dark Elven Cleric of Innoruuk. Aside from the usual wrangling 
  with stats, trying to train the right skills and looking for the next best hunting 
  ground, I tried to play the role as well. I&#146;ve always enjoyed Rping the 
  bad guy, maybe that&#146;s one reason I prefer to be the Game Master for pen 
  and paper games as opposed to a player. Online, in various MUDs and a few other 
  large scale commercial games, I&#146;ve tried to take on the role of the antagonist. 
  Let everyone else pursue the well lit paths of the hero, I&#146;ll be that occasional 
  cloud that darkens their travels. However, it rarely worked as well as I hoped 
  it would.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Being a GM for 
  a pen and paper game and playing the antagonist offers some similarities to 
  Rping evil. I provide a challenge for my players, keep them on their toes and 
  generally make their fictional lives more interesting. There is a certain understanding 
  that exists between the players and the GM and expectations on both sides. The 
  GM provides the setting, the obstacles and even assistance in times of need&#133; 
  anything that keeps the story interesting and furthers the players enjoyment. 
  The GM tries his or her best to find a pace and level of challenge the players 
  are comfortable with. The players do their best to overcome these obstacles 
  and, further, do their best to just relax and have fun. If they are at each 
  other&#146;s throats it is hopefully in the spirit of roleplaying their characters 
  and not any true anger toward each other.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A single GM for 
  a small group of players provides direction. A GM in a pen and paper game sets 
  the pace of the story and in a sense arbitrates the outcome of certain actions. 
  Playing the obstacle, playing the antagonist, requires judicious thought in 
  order to keep from upsetting your players. I&#146;m reminded of <a href="../Issue125/edita.htm">Absor&#146;s 
  recent editorial</a> about the Evil GM syndrome: <i>&#147;The one that delights 
  in the suffering of his players. The one that will rarely kill a character, 
  but will gladly maim them because maiming is far more brutal and doesn&#146;t 
  allow you to start a new character. He gives us stuff only because he plans 
  to take it away the moment that we get attached to it.&#148;</i> Any GM that 
  does this will find they will start rapidly losing players. Not many players 
  want to play a game under an egomaniacal power-mad GM.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a MMORPG there 
  is no such restraint and guidance. This puts some serious responsibility on 
  the shoulders of the players. When people are roleplaying they need to act in 
  a responsible manner that is respectable to other players, just as a GM has 
  to be respectable to those he is running a game for, in the interest of the 
  overall group. Everyone is there to have fun and everyone&#146;s role should 
  add to the enjoyment and depth of the overall setting. If everyone is afflicted 
  with something akin to the &#147;Evil GM&#148; syndrome, things generally degenerate 
  to a simple first person shooter style frag-fest. Powerful players camp newbie 
  grounds, personal harassment becomes rampant, and players begin to do anything 
  to get &#145;an edge&#146; over the competition. In such a point and click world 
  of death, complex, interesting roles are quickly forgotten and players take 
  to simply being competitive game players. The game becomes only a shadow of 
  an RPG.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A point to note: 
  Being nice to a player and nice to a character are two completely different 
  things. The plight of those roleplaying evil is plagued by those claiming to 
  be roleplaying evil who are truly just grief players in disguise. These players 
  constantly appear in online games and ruin the role of antagonist in an attempt 
  to find an excuse for their abhorrent and completely non-roleplayed behavior. 
  Roleplaying evil means you are acting as an evil character in that particular 
  setting would act. Doing things such as exploiting bugs to your benefit, killing 
  characters indiscriminately without any attempt to add something to the community 
  story, or doing things which interfere with normal game play has nothing to 
  do with roleplaying evil. That&#146;s simply being evil or amoral as a player 
  and a person.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, in-character 
  conflict isn&#146;t a bad thing. It&#146;s necessary if anyone is to claim to 
  be roleplaying an evil character. But I think players themselves (and thus their 
  characters) must be given the tools to deal with such a menace. Given the ability 
  to deal with the threats each other presents&#133;something in addition to hunting 
  down transgressors in packs. The biggest problem, in my opinion, with players 
  RPing the full spectrum of &#147;evil&#148; and &#147;good&#148; has been the 
  failure of any large scale online world to allow itself to be regulated by those 
  very players. Developers prefer, it seems, creating special &#147;code&#148; 
  to deal with anarchy in their utopias or relying on mostly unorganized (through 
  no fault of their own) and overworked volunteers. These offer up new problems. 
  Many &#147;solutions&#148; are indiscriminate in who they effect. Those who 
  choose to roleplay evil are hit just as hard as the usually intended target: 
  grief players. Further, these solutions exist in a state which is far removed 
  from the setting and any role a player may have selected. Accessing these means 
  a break of fiction. It&#146;s either some omnipotent &#147;customer service 
  rep&#148; to the rescue or the stalwart (and obviously artificial) AI.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The creators of 
  EverQuest took note of the profusion of player slaughter and anarchy in other 
  online systems, I believe. This was the main drive behind one of their solutions, 
  the PK switch. They saw no more efficient way than to simply disallow it through 
  hard code. It works quite well in some cases. Sure, many players will just find 
  other ways to annoy and harass if they choose. However, the sheer body count 
  and the worst loss a player can suffer, that of a well planned character to 
  an inconsiderate player, is definitely kept to a minimum. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But does their 
  world benefit from it? Yes, definitely. But only because of one thing. The focus 
  is shifted on the standard servers from player conflict to player versus the 
  environment. Players are meant to operate as teams in a constant struggle versus 
  the environment. Cooperation in this endeavor is really the only means to play 
  the game. Conflict between characters is simply viewed as anti-social and not 
  benefiting of the way the game is &#147;suppose&#148; to be played. Roleplaying 
  an antagonist is, for all intents, dead and at best anti-social. Even on the 
  Team and unrestricted PK servers of EverQuest, much of the game is one of controlling 
  spawn points and besting the environment, before your enemies can. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This must be very 
  confusing for a first time roleplayer. Take, for instance, someone who wishes 
  to become a Dark Elf. They read the history of the race; a birth from heinous 
  deeds and their race&#146;s founder, the god of hatred upon Norrath. They see 
  signs of aggression with the &#147;good&#148; races in the background story 
  and quests provided around their slightly xenophobic home city of Neriak. But 
  the game itself portrays a different view. All players are united against a 
  common enemy, the environment. Dark Elves and High Elves mingle; Shadowknights, 
  presumed paragons of hatred and evil, risk life and limb to help clerics of 
  good. Anything goes so that the environment, the true antagonist, is overcome. 
  The story however, is now lost and roles simply fall to the wayside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roleplaying evil, 
  as I found, in these conditions is a fruitless endeavor and mostly misunderstood. 
  Taunt your Dark Elf brother who just helped a human kill one of Neriak&#146;s 
  dragoons and you are anti-social, lecture a fellow cleric of Innoruuk on sharing 
  her god given (from the god of hate mind you) powers with light races and you 
  are given a lecture in return on not being a racist. There is simply no place 
  in that game for a player trying to roleplay an evil character. In fact, it 
  could be argued that no one is interested in the roles at all, and to the extreme 
  the story as a whole. Players are simply players; their characters simply digital 
  extensions of themselves out to beat the AI into submission in a decidedly OOC 
  way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is much the 
  same as I have experienced with many other commercial MMORPGs. Playing a role 
  other than &#145;team player versus the digital world&#146; often gets you branded 
  anti-social in a real world sense. Now, I have had some great success playing 
  evil characters in smaller MUDs. In a smaller community with a more selective 
  player base, it&#146;s much easier to nurture a truly cohesive environment where 
  every player has a part in the overall story. In the big commercial games, story 
  is lost and replaced with automated efficiency that can never truly draw the 
  players in for any length of time. Roleplaying happens in these MMORPGs but 
  only in tiny pockets when the mood suits the players; something which could, 
  sadly, be accomplished in a simple multi-player (non-massive) CRPG behind passworded 
  sessions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I would love to 
  someday truly take on the role of an evil character in an MMORPG. Now that would 
  be a great game. I&#146;m ready to provide a living, breathing obstacle to the 
  heroes of whatever world it may be. To try to add to a large-scale and intriguing 
  plot which encompasses that entire world and all who set foot on its digital 
  ground. Heroes of that brave world beware, I&#146;ll be there in the shadows 
  of that well lit path.</font></p>
