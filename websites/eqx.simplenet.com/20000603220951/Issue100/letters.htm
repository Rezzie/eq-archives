Dearest Aklar,
<br><br>
Your departure from the pages of the Express will be sorely missed.  Thank
you for sharing a portion of your creativity with us.  I hope your further
endeavors to become a published author are successful.  Three cheers for
Aklar! HOORAY! HOORAY! HOORAY!

After pestering a GM for a while, I have learned a little about the gods
of Norrath.  It seems they all have descriptions..  Here goes.  Fennin Ro is
the God of the Plane of Fire, and father to Solusek Ro (Son of Fire).
Tarrew Marr, E'Ci, and Povar are the ruling triumvirate of the Plane of
Water.  (Prexus however, is a minor god of Norrath's oceans)  The Rathe are
thirteen identical beings that rule the Plane of Earth.  The Plane of Sky is
ruled by Xegony, a beautiful being with faerie-like wings.  The Tribunal,
despite what dark elves may think, are the six Hammers, rulers of the Plane
of Justice.  Vallon and Tallon Zek are indeed the sons of Rallos Zek, ruler
of the Plane of Power.  Cazic-Thule rules the Plane of Fear, Innoruuk rules
the Plane of Hate.  Brell Serilis rules the Plane of Underfoot.  Rumor says
that Bristlebane and Mithaniel Marr were killed in the armageddon of the Age
of Beta, by Innoruuk, who himself was recently killed by mortal invaders to
his Plane.

<em>Wow, good work, Briza!  Your pestering of the messengers of the gods seems
to have borne some fruit.  My question is - if they know it, why havent
they told us about it yet?  Your brief descriptions are enough to point the
direction, but I'm sure there is more, if a GM was able to tell you about
it.  I guess I'm just greedy, hoping for more depth in Norrath.  The good
sign is that we have this to look forward to!

The artwork featured in Issue 99 has inspired me to write in and give the artist my highest regards, along with my hopes that he/she continues with their work.  The sketch exudes such feeling, I was really quite moved when I saw it.  A pity the artist has chosen to be anonymous, as I would be most interested in contacting them regarding a story I'm writing that could use such illustration.

I just finished reading Oghma's editorial this week and I have to say "Damn!  Someone else does that too?!"  I play a Dwarven Cleric on Rodcet Nife and I have much the same experience that Oghma does.  Maybe it's because we are clerics (the ultimate group class) or perhaps he's right and we're just controll freaks, but discipline in a group makes the game so much more enjoyable. 
<br><br>
My problem is that just when the group is starting to get working well I have to log off.  I cannot play EQ for long blocks of time like everyone else seems to and I don't have a set large group that I play with.  So I have to pick up groups where and when I can.  This has gotten me killed more times than I like to think about.  But the feeling that you get when the group is working is better than just about anything else.  Right after the fight  where the puller got more than he bargained for on the run back and everybody was fighting for their lives (had two on me and was popping heals on the tanks at the same time).  When everybody looks around, sees most of the group at two bubbles or less, all casters at 20% or less and the massive pile of bodies that need to be looted.  The rush that says "We can take ANYTHING!!!"  hits you like a ton of bricks and you think "this is why I play".  Not the levels.  Not the cool graphics.  Not the "look what I can do".  It's the well oiled team that makes this game worth it. 
<br><br>
Just thought I would let ya know that there are others that feel this way.

<em>You are SO right.  I was once in the Crushbone throne room, and had one of
those absolutely scary moments when the throne room all spawns and then
some idiot trains in Crush and his guard.  Our group stayed in and fought,
and I was popping up and down to meditate and heal, meditate and heal, and
by the end we were all alive and the orcs were all dead.  What a rush!
Thanks for your comment, it's very true - there is no greater experience in
the game.

Strange that Tarrew Marr would be one of the so far unkown gods as of yet, because it was one of the original servers, even dating back to Beta. Perhaps Tarrew was the father of Mithaniel and Erollisi? That is my personal theory on the issue. It would be really nice to see more and more gods introduced though, even if only through written history or perhaps an occasional appearance. I would love to see Karana some time, perhaps making an appearance in the middle of North Karana. It would be fitting, no?

You know, I've been reading about the GM quests that have been going on,
and I only hope that more will happen - this is a GREAT thing, and the gods
being seen in norrath or even slain, as Innoruuk recently was, is also
wonderful.  I'm working on a "Norrath since beta" timeline to put the
history if Norrath in perspective - if I can get together all the events
that have happened.  Tunare has been spotted, and those in the Plane of
Fear have seen Cazic-Thule - and Bristlebane and Mithaniel Marr were slain
by Innoruuk on the last night of beta.
<br><br>
Thanks for your thoughts!

Ack!!!  Ye gods!!!  I just read Auntie Moog's column.  Her FINAL column???
Say it isn't so!!!  I have depended on her so much for her pithy advice!
She has made my time in Norrath immeasurably better.  I may have to cancel
my subscription, now.  Don't get me wrong, I like EQ Express a lot.  I
always read the editorials and also look forward to the cartoons and Fit to
Print.  I'm even becoming increasingly fond of Gainam's writings.  But I
just don't know if I can bear to come back, knowing that I will forever be
filled with the loss of my favorite Troll writer ever.  It will just be too
painful to look down in that familiar space and not see Moog staring back at
me.
<br><br>
Bah! Can't something be done?  Didn't you make Moog sign a contract or
something?  Would a petition get Auntie Moog to come back?  Somebody barsh
some sense into her!!  
<br><br>

<br><br>
Auntie Moog, why hast thou forsaken us??  There is still so much I need to
learn from you...

Hi,
 <br><br>
You probably hear this all the time and well your going to hear it again. "Great job on Everquest Express, the articles are informative, the humour great and above all the writing is excellent."
 <br><br>
Please pass on my comments to all the contributors as they all deserve a pat on the back.
 <br><br>
Is there anywhere for someone to vote for your website, because you deserve an award, say Best Games Newsletter or something of that nature.
 <br><br>
Regards,
