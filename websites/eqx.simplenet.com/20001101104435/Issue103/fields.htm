By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young girl calling,<br>
"Conner, they have taken you away,<br>
For you stole Sir Lucan's corn,<br>
So our son might see the morn.<br>
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay."
<br><br>
Low lie the fields of Karana,<br>
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.<br>
Our love was on the wind.<br>
We had dreams and songs to sing.<br>
Now it's lonely 'round the fields of Karana.
<br><br>
By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling,<br>
"Nothing matters, Sara, but you're free.<br>
Against D'Lere and his crown,<br>
I rebelled, they ran me down.<br>
Now you must raise our son with dignity."
<br><br>
Low lie the fields of Karana,<br>
Where once we watched the small free birds fly,<br>
Our love was on the wind,<br>
We had dreams and songs to sing,<br>
Now it's lonely 'round the fields of Karana.
<br><br>
By a lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star falling,<br>
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky.<br>
Now she waited, hoped and prayed that he might return one day.<br>
Will he walk again in the fields of Karana?
<br><br>
No more, in the fields of Karana,<br>
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.<br>
Our love was on the wind.<br>
We had dreams and songs to sing.<br>
Now it's lonely 'round the fields of Karana.<br>
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Karana.
