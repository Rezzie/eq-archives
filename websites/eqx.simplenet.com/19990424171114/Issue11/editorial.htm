OK, ok, enough already.  I was not about to deny Thumper a chance to say his piece, despite 
what you or I think of him.  EQX will always attempt to be fair to all our readers.  You guys got that?  
Good.
<br><br>
I'm sorry that I was so unresponsive to e-mail this week.  My phone line was fouled up.  
I didn't get it back until late this week.  I try to answer all e-mail that I get.  So if I lost 
your e-mail or did not respond, I'm sorry.
<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
