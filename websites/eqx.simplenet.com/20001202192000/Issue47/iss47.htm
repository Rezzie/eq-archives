The rain fell heavily outside the tavern, reflecting the mood of the wizard standing before the window.  Preferring to use mundane forms of travel whenever possible, he was forced to wait until the rain let up before boarding the SeaKing and travelling to Kerra.  Sipping from his glass and glaring out the window, Ozymandius was lost in introspection.

I am sure you're going to read this and say "That's Winter all over" ..rofl.. but you made me think of it so I have to tell it to you.

The bullies in our neighborhood were a gang of sorts, led by a nasty scruffy girl named Jackie. She wasn't all that tough, but she had a friend who was 16(!) who was also very nasty and had very bleached blond hair, which made her cooler than any of us 12 year olds. Somehow I was cast in the role of defender, and the other kids would run to me when there was trouble. I was usually smart enough to get them out of it, picking my approach so as not to face the whole gang and always having my staunch defender, my collie Sheba, at my side.

Moon and star seemed to hang over the dreamy expanse of night that rimmed the sleeping lands of Antonica. The moon followed star in path, cascading silvery drizzle through thick cracks in the night clouds hanging low over a platinum sea.  Quiet, not a sound above the sea swells could be heard. Loneliness, as though nature itself slumbered under the cotton silver canopy of moonbeam sky. Stealing through the ice liquid plain, lending her gentle swish to the ocean waves, sped the <i>Fawn</i> like an exiled whale<b>...</b>

While we wait for EverQuest to reach open beta, we at EverQuest Express like
to pretend we are already playing the game.  Here we offer a humorous look
at what our staff could be doing if this were true.  Watch this space, as a 
new staff member will be featured each week.  This week, Oghma.

(By Keafa mother of two and wife to a geek)
<br><br>
Many have asked the question, "how do I get my woman involved in the games I love?"  Razor has written a few good articles like <a href="../Issue20/wife.htm">How to Geektify Your Wife 101</a> and <a href="../Issue42/hail.htm">"Hail Razor, Our Geek Master!"</a>.  Now I think it is time for a woman to add her two cents on how to get the female involved with the vast world of online games *grin*.

After reading about the anonymous <a href="../Issue46/nextgen.htm">tale</a> about EQ's youngest tester, I reflected on how my own daughter adapted to video games. She is three and a half years old and has been trying to play video games for about a year. It is interesting to me how quickly kids will learn these things that young.

	In my AD&D group, I'm having a dilemma.  I have lost the urge to role-play the character I'm playing.  Running around with a Halfling fighter/thief has not been as challenging/fun as I thought it would be.  I guess I'm becoming more of a spell-casting player these days.  What am I going to do now?  The campaign is in full swing.

Please... keep posting about your campaign! I had a feeling, but until you described your initial adventures....it was then that I knew, you've been introduced to Planescape, cutter! My favorite setting of all time. The webpage I'm working on will actually be featuring some ways to link EQ and Planescape. I'm not going to get into too much detail with you now...you're being introduced in a great way, and I definitely don't want to spoil it ;)

<em>OK, so role-playing is a big issue right now.  I've got a pickle for ya.  When you start out in EverQuest, you are understandably pretty wussy.  Say you're role-playing an Erudite Wizard who has been studying the art of magic all your life.  When you create your character in EverQuest, how do you explain the fact that, although you have all these years of experience, the best trick you can do right now is lighting your thumb on fire?
