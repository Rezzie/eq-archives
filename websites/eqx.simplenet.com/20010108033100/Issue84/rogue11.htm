<b>Part Eleven</b>


<br><br>

    Kinory woke up in a small stone cell, with a massive headache and a feeling of unreality.  Late afternoon sun streamed through the tiny slit of a window, high above her head.  Her woodland senses strangled by the confinement, she squinted at the brightness and tried to estimate how long she had been out.
<br><br>
   "Twelve hours," she muttered to herself.  By now, Daryth would… do nothing.  Or be fighting for his own life, as her failure would be common knowledge in the Guild.  She hung her head, brows knotting and mouth twisting in an effort to keep from weeping.  She shook her head furiously, and then dragged herself to her feet.  Metal rang against stone as she moved, and she remembered them chaining her to the wall by both wrists.  
<br><br>
   She laughed bitterly.
<br><br>
   "Do you think I'm so dangerous?" she asked the squat wooden door.  A pair of eyes appeared at the slit, and a muted discussion was followed by the sound of bolts being withdrawn.  The door swung creakingly inward, and her brother entered, ducking slightly to clear the frame.
<br><br>
   Kinory watched him silently, unable to think.  She had convinced herself that he'd been a dream, a nightmare.  But there he stood, looking at her with an expression of such sorrow and pain… she broke eye contact first.
<br><br>
   "Kinny," he began.
<br><br>
   "You're dead," she told him, eyes flashing back to him.  "We got a letter, and everything.  They delivered it <em>years</em> ago.  Why didn't you write us?  Do you know what that did to Mother?"
<br><br>
   He flinched back from her outburst.
<br><br>
   "I didn't have a choice.  I was captured by Dervishes, held for a year.  And when they released me, I wasn't thinking about writing back <em>home</em>."  He spat the word out.   "As if anyone there cared."
<br><br>
   "I cared," cried Kinory.  
<br><br>
   "Why did you end up like this?"  he shouted back at her.  "You <em>knew</em>, you've <em>always</em> known that I despised…"  He gestured at her blacks, a look of rage and disappointment twisting his features.
<br><br>
   She was silent a long, cold moment.
<br><br>
   "Why should you care?" she whispered finally.  "Why should you start caring now what happens to me?"
<br><br>
   He recoiled from her, from the dead frozen tone in her voice.
<br><br>
   "What happened to you?" he said, his voice breaking.  
<br><br>
    "You died," she answered.
<br><br>
    The silence lay heavily between them, but Kinory, her heart aching with betrayal and wounded love, gritted her teeth together and held his gaze.  At last, he turned and went silently from the cell.  The door boomed shut.
<br><br>
   Kinory sagged in her chains and let the tears come.
<br><br>

   Much later, as the light was dying out of the small window, and her shoulders had begun to feel as though bees had nested in them, the door opened again, this time admitting Macha Somhan, the Commander of the Militia and two burly Militiamen.  She lifted her head and managed to stand with some of the grace that was a Rogue's trademark, feeling her stomach sink within her.  She should have known that Bayle would turn the matter over to the Freeport authorities.    
<br><br>
   He left his bully boys by the door and came forward by himself, head cocked on one side as though seeking some answer in her features.  She schooled them to stillness, met his gaze levelly, and said nothing.
<br><br>
   "So young," he murmured at last, and then hit her.
<br><br>
   She reeled sideways, was caught short by her chains, and hung there for a second, dizzy.  Then she forced herself back to her feet, and looked at him again, expressionless.  He smiled in almost a fatherly manner, and hit her again, harder.
<br><br>
  He bent over her as she panted against the cold damp wall.
<br><br>
  "Why not just tell me?  We both know that your fellows will not be coming to help you.  I think it is safe to say that they have already wiped your name from the Guild annals and made their apologies to the client, whoever he was.  I am astonished by your loyalty, in the circumstances."  He straightened, adjusting his leather gloves.  "All I want is the client."
<br><br>
  Her pride and her jaw both hurting, Kinory closed her eyes.  He was right.  She was buying herself nothing but pain by silence.
<br><br>
   "I don't know who commissioned the job," she said, her voice husky.  "It was arranged through someone else.  All I know is that it was someone in Freeport.  Not an export."
<br><br>
   "Who was it arranged through, then?"  Kinory took a pained breath.  He reached over and pulled her head back by the hair.  "Who?"  he asked again.
<br><br>
   "Galern," she spat.  He released her, and she hung her head, letting her hair shield her from the contemptuous stares of the Militiamen.
<br><br>
   "Thank you," Somhan said, without any apparent sarcasm.  They left.  Kinory stayed on her knees, feeling like a traitor.  Though Galern was a bastard, and had tried to kill her more than once, that was within the Guild laws.  There was no mercy in the Rogue's Code.  What she had done was betray a fellow to the law.  For this they <em>would</em> strike her name from the annals, and put a curse on it, besides.
<br><br>
   She moved her head, wincing at the stab of pain from her neck, and managed to wipe the blood from her mouth with her right hand.  They hadn't fed her all day, and her stomach complained loudly.  
<br><br>
   Kinory snarled in sudden disgust.  She was laying here in her chains like a soft citizen, laying down and taking what they chose to deal out as though she had no choice in the matter.  She knew why they hadn't fed her.  A waste of resources, considering the penalty in Freeport for attempted murder, especially assassination of a visiting dignitary.  Was she just going to hang here and cry until they came to cut her head off?
<br><br>
   "I'll be damned if I do," she muttered, and turned her attention to the chains.
<br><br>
   The manacles had been made for human sized wrists, and were narrowed by wire wrapped around the band of iron.  The left one seemed slightly looser, and she spent several minutes rotating her wrist inside it.  The wire pulled away from the manacle slightly.  She tucked her thumb into the palm of her hand and pulled.  The wire bit into the pad of flesh beneath her thumb, and she let out an agonized cry.  Then her hand popped free, minus a bit of skin.  She panted, shaking it lightly to get the circulation back.  She fumbled in her tunic, praying that the guard who had searched her had been lax.
<br><br>
  Her fingers closed on her last back-up pick, sewn into the waistband of her pants just above her buttocks.  <em>Guards always just grab at your ass, and never think to actually search you properly</em>.  Katha's grinning face floating in her mind's eye, and Kinory had to blink away tears before she could insert the pick into the lock.
<br><br>
   The lock was old and rusted, and the pick almost not strong enough, but she managed, after five minutes' careful work, to open it.  She massaged her wrist as she rose, unimpeded, to her feet, and examined the room.  It was empty but for rings around the walls for other chains, and the one small and barred window high up on the wall.  A shadow moved across the slit in the door, and she crouched back against the wall, lifting her arms to the approximate position they had been in.  The shadow moved away again, and she relaxed slightly.
<br><br>
   The walls were rough, and she scaled the ten feet to the window without too much trouble, and then hung there, prodding at the bars.  Though rusty, they offered no great hope of escape.  They sat stolidly in the stone frame, and didn't shift in the slightest, even when she strained her whole strength against them.  She dropped to the floor again, and crouched there, thinking furiously.
<br><br>
   Footsteps down the hall, and raised voices, brought her to her feet again.  She darted across the cell, and slid her hands into the loose, open manacles.  The door opened, as she took hold of the chains, hiding the fact of her partial escape.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
   <p style="text-align: justify">
  Bayle entered, followed by her brother, and two other of the Qeynos Guardsmen.  She ignored her brother, focused her attention on her previous mark.  Behind him came Somhan, looking furious.  He, too, had three of his men with him.
<br><br>
   "I tell you, Bayle, this is my city, and my dungeon.  I have interrogated the prisoner, and the matter is closed!"
<br><br>
   "I will decide for myself, thank you.  It was my life that was threatened, Commander Somhan, and I will decide when the matter is closed."
<br><br>
  Somhan shut his mouth tightly and glared at Bayle.
<br><br>
  "You may wait outside," said the ruler of Qeynos mildly.  With a snort, the man went, slamming the cell door behind him.  His men stayed, taking up positions by the door.
<br><br>
  Bayle turned back to Kinory.
<br><br>
   "So," he said, coming forward slowly.  "Apparently, you know nothing of who wanted me dead, or why, or when the deal was struck, or anything else of real use.  Since this Daryth you named has fled the city, why, we are left with nothing to tie to this mystery but you."
<br><br>
   "Daryth?" she blurted, before she could stop herself.  Her gaze went to the door and found the Commander's eyes glaring through the slit.  Her mind raced.  The commissioner of the deed had been in Freeport, but why would he want Bayle dead?  He saw the knowledge in her eyes.  The door flew open.
<br><br>
   Kinory ceased to think, and simply acted.  She launched herself off the wall, rolled, and came up in between Gwyn and Bayle.  One arm snaked around Bayle's neck, and the other plucked the dagger neatly from her brother's belt.  She wrenched the man around, blade to his neck, and held him between her and the rest of the room.
<br><br>
  Somhan was frozen by the door, sword in hand, fury in his eyes.  
<br><br>
  "Back up,"  she snapped, and pricked Bayle under the chin with the dagger.  He sucked in a breath, and gestured at the others.   They backed warily away.
<br><br>
   "Kinory," said Gwyn.  "Don't do this."  The other two Qeynos soldiers eyed him sideways.
<br><br>
   "How do you…" began Bayle, and then bit back the rest of the sentence and Kinory shoved harder with the knife.
<br><br>
   "I'm leaving," she said.  "The Honorable Antonius Bayle and I are walking out of here and then I will let him go.  Alright?"  Her hands were sweating, and she hoped that her captive couldn't tell.  She prodded him, and he took an awkward step forward, bent slightly backward by the difference in their heights.
<br><br>
  "Kinory, no.  Take me instead," said Gwyn urgently.
<br><br>
  "Are you mad?"  she asked him.  "Get out of my way!"
<br><br>
  "Kinory…" he stepped toward her.
<br><br>
  "No!"  The dagger wavered from Bayle's throat, and he threw himself to the side.  She snatched at his tunic, and was borne along.  They ended up on the floor, wrestling for the dagger.  Hands seized her from behind, dragged her off.  There was a ring of steel as the Guardsmen and Somhan drew their swords.   Gwyn was holding her from behind, right arm twisted up behind her back.  Bayle staggered to his feet.
<br><br>
  "Well done, Gwyn," he said, and then stiffened abruptly.  He slowly toppled over, to reveal Somhan, standing with bloodied blade in hand.
<br><br>
   "Kill them," he said to his men.  
<br><br>
   Gwyn flung Kinory at one of his men, and drew his sword.  Kinory dodged the man's grasping hand, and put her back against the wall.  The cell filled with the clash of steel on steel, and she scuttled into a corner.  Gwyn cut one man down, and went after Somhan as he fled the cell.  She ducked under a wild slash and raced after them.
