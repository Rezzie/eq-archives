<em>The different areas in EQ, they seem to have been added just so they would have one of each (jungle, Mts etc)  Do these need a history? (I think each region should have its own past..) Are the players up to it(making up the history, if brad and his 'crew' does not)? can they add more to the region then just its name and thats its a jungle with temples in it, etc...? In other words...make this one about role-playing, particularly about regions :)

Brad has mentioned before in chats that the history for the areas will be revealed in game though quests.  Given the information we already have, we believe that Veeshan the Crystalline Dragon was the first entity to stake claim to the world known as Norrath.  Followed closely by Brell Serilis, who informed the other Gods of Norrath's existence, where they brought about children into the new world to keep the seed of Veeshan in check.  With Innoruuk feeling left out, he followed with a vengeance.
<br><br>
We have a short history about the humans, which was written by a human. Leaving the other races and the lands left unknown.  There are areas on the map that give insight as their history simply by their names.  Lavastorm mountains for example, obviously a volcanic land filled with mystical energy.  Molten rock that is sent into the air and across the lands and a Dragon has been mythed to live there.  Or like the Dead Hills, a place that few have every returned from thus the name Dead Hills.  
<br><br>
You can get a feel for history of certain areas by the inhabitants.  Like the Qeynos and Freeport regions, and probably the lands between these two major human cities will be lands of human history and war.  Oggok and Grobb will have a shadier history dealing with the Ogres and Trolls and the wars between these races and men. 
<br><br>
In my opinion I feel that 989 has left the history of the lands to be written by the players themselves.   As you start out in your home town you will probably get a feel for security and safety as you learn every shop and meet every guard.  A place to call home.  As you grow with age you will travel to lands that lay farther away with new creatures that only the elders speak of encountering in their youth.  Whether the journey to these lands is out of curiosity or a quest that is vital to you homeland, it will determine the value of your adventure.  Thus you are creating a personal history.  What would draw a halfling from the security of his home?  What monsters lay in the thicket that threaten his existence.  Is that not a history in itself?
<br><br>
War! The highlight of any history book.  War for land, power, and survival paints a picture yet to be seen.  In which area will the IronToe Brigade meet up with the Skorchers?  That itself will be a chapter for the history book of Norrath. Watching a battle between The Red Capes of Justice and The Insidious Brotherhood, who will win? The winner writes history.
<br><br>
All in all even though we know little of the lands of Norrath, that void in our minds will be filled with endless memories.  The first time we encounter a earth elemental or a Cyclops, who will you be with and will you be alive at the end of the encounter?  Those will be the pages of history for your race and the land you are standing on. History has yet to written!
