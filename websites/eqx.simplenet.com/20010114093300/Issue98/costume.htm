Furlespit cackled with glee as the bookkeeper pushed out a cart of material that was soon to be burnt. Much was fit for nothing more than such, but occasionally she would find fine reading material in these piles. She suspected the bookkeeper knew of her exploits in his trash, but feared questioning her about it. She was a rather strange Tier'dal after all.
<br><br>
	Usually there was nothing worth searching for in these carts, but this week she would find scraps worth an adventure. Several scrolls written in a plain Gnomish hand caught her attention. Although they appeared to be several years old, the title of one referred to the Harvest Moon, of which time it currently was again in Norrath.
<br><br>
	After assembling the carefully numbered pages from the trash, although more than half were missing, she sat down to read them and sipped some wine. They detailed an event held in Faydark where the fair elves and children of Brell would don costumes and wigs, dance and revel in their pitiful joy in attempt to ward off the spirits of the dead. Furlespit eyed the manuscripts doubtfully, as she had heard of no such event, and dismissed the papers as Bristlebane comedy. Yet somehow the myth would not be banished from her so easily. 
<br><br>
	Furlespit's wasn't the soundest mind as she mused herself into a daydream. In her frequent manic bouts alone with only the dead, such a whim might take her. In her mind she was already wearing the costume. The minstrels would play their music and the dancers would sway. She would have a dress and a wig, and forget the lonely dead for one night. Only for a little while, she thought, a little while she would dance.
<br><br>
	Her chance to put both feet on the ground had passed. She was ready to go to the Harvest Moon Festival in the Faydark. She packed a dress and boots fit for the vilest of temptresses in her sack. She left right away, with visions in her head of what the event would be like. She traveled to the Docks unseen in the night, and was well on her way over the sea by morning. 
<br><br>
	Escaping from the Kaladim docks deep into Butcherblock she eyed the others on the road from a safe distance, finding comfort in the darkest shadows from unwanted eyes. Not many of them seemed in garb fit for a party, although the common dress of a dwarf struck her as nothing but humorous anyway. Onward she traveled to the Great Forest of elves, figuring she was probably late. By now she had convinced herself that her invitation had simply been lost before it reached her. Surely there would be other Tier'dal there. 
<br><br>
	When she arrived in the forest, in the distance she could see a great gathering. Indeed there was a festival of costumes here, and a clamoring of music and laughter. She inched closer to the event, not seeing any of her kin amidst them. An oversight surely. Soon she was close enough to get a really good look. She observed the dancers and listened to the awful music. Ah-ha, she thought, no wonder she saw none of her kind. She noticed that a mask hid everyone's face, not a single soul was without one. She needed one to not feel left out.
<br><br>
	She gazed upon a lustful elf couple, dancing and drinking and kissing between songs. What a revelry this is, Bristlebane comedy indeed, she though. More and more of this she saw elsewhere in the crowd. Drinking, dancing, and affectionate gestures swayed in tune to the bad music. It is a wonder that they would have dared invite her to this event, but she would not disappoint them, even if her invitation never arrived. She could play the part; she would wear the costume.
<br><br>
	As the night went on she watched the elf women, deciding which she would secretly ask to borrow a mask so she could join in the event. Her opportunity came when one beautiful woodland elf girl was sent to fetch more wine, leaving her tall dancing partner behind to socialize. She followed the girl away from the crowd, and startled her with a whisper from behind the wine rack.
<br><br>
	"Fair child, I forgot my mask and need to borrow one for the evening." Furlespit whispered around the corner. The Young elf apprehensively answered the foreign-tongued stranger "you can borrow mine," she started. "I am done with it for a mom-" she walked around the corner and froze at the sight of the stranger. A cry might have escaped her, but she passed out from fright instead. Her mask fell gently from her hand into Furlespit's. Too much wine perhaps, Furlespit thought as she donned her dress. 
<br><br>
	The music might have stopped when the ghoulishly dressed necromancer walked into view, had not the Captain of the Guard motioned them to ignore her as he approached to question the out-of-place visitor. His chaste eyes traced the sinful 'v' of her dress, lace of her boots and darkest of stockings. Through her mask he could see her hazel-green eyes sparkle with delight at his uneasiness. He felt alone without his sword under her scrutiny. Other eyes watched as well, looking to the shaken captain for an answer. "A dance perhaps milord?" She stepped forward.
<br><br>
	She took his uneasy hand and set them in a twirl amidst the now curious onlookers. The fearless musicians put on a relentless tempo that would churn the crowd into a chaotic melee of colors, laughter and merriment. As the song came to a close the Captain, who felt out of order, was pulled close to Furlespit. Her lips caressed his ever so lightly, as if only promising a kiss. Then the next song began, a mischievous number not for one partner. A young woodland elf lad took her hand as the dance began, leaving the Captain swooning in his sin. He could only look across the crowd after her, contemplating the fiend.
<br><br>
	From partner to partner she swayed, looked each until the next in the eyes for that deep sense of fear, and then left those eyes with a shameful sparkle of lust. The Captain could not pay attention to what he was doing, stealing glances through the crowd for her too often, distracting his fair women until finally he stumbled, sparking a gasp and much laughter.
<br><br>
 The not-so-forgiving Noble elf woman scoffed and looked at Furlespit with a strong glare, challenging her right to woo the Captain. Furlespit returned a playful glance, the tossing-down of the glove between them. The stubborn Noble was not accustomed to the challenge, and struck at Furlespit. The smack removed the mask, confirming the suspicions of any that did not already know her heritage.
<br><br>
 As the mask fell, so did her demeanor. A gaze from the eyes of the Queen of the Dead herself struck into the soul of the Noble elf, who now cowered in tears. Around her like ribbons wove threads of dark magic, as she elevated above the ground. A great wave of eerie blue energy struck all those around her with bitter cold, draining them of any strength they may have had to run or attack her with. Not far away the guards could be heard racing to help.
<br><br>
Without a word, Furlespit looked at the still stunned Captain. Even at ten paces he felt too close, shuddering under her gaze. Perhaps instead he was too far away, as the velvet memory of her blackest lips brought him to his knees. She stared at him as long as she could, feeling his fealty wisp away into the autumn night. As the guards reached as close as they would that night, she let her mind's costume melt away. Her eyes' gleam dimmed instead with hate as she disappeared into the night.
<br><br>
Even as the guards searched for her, the Captain hung his head. He quivered in fear of his shame, and quivered for what he could not have. The Guards overlooked him as another victim of her spell. He would live from that day with them believing that very lie, and would even forgive himself eventually. However he would never again dance the same under the Harvest Moon.
