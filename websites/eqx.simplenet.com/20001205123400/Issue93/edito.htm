<b>Religion and Norrath.</b>

<br><br>
My apologies for not writing for a while, everyone. It seems that Florida storms are committed to disrupting my contributions to EQX.  In addition, my motherboard looks like it fried, so hopefully by the time you read this I'll be using a pIII instead of my p200. *crosses fingers*
<br><br>
A long time ago Ian Ash and I tossed back and forth a series of Religion, Race and Society articles for each race, and we snagged up and stopped, I think, around Halflings.  I re-read them this week and realized we needed to continue in that vein, so I'm going to look at religion and race again, but I'd like to throw out some thought on religion in Norrath as a background for next weeks article.
<br><br>
One of the things that is important to remember is that unlike the RW, there is no doubt as to the deities existence in Norrath.  Players have seen Innoruuk and Cazic Thule, and Cazic has even been slain once or twice.  Agnostics, then, aren't really arguing about the existence of gods, but about their power and control over events.  An agnostic would see a god as nothing more than a more powerful fire giant or dragon, not an individual who grants spells and mana to priests.  Worthy of fear or respect, perhaps awe, but not worship.
<br><br>
Will there be quests that reward players with an item that is usable only by a worshipper of deity x?  We have items that are usable by only a specific race, or class… but not one by religion?  I'd love to see something in place that is a 'holy' quest.  Many quests are given by the cleric's guilds (except the Cleric's guild in Neriak), but they result in items that are usable by non-worshippers who have sufficient faction.
<br><br>
When the First Crusade was launched against "infidels" in the Holy Land, mob-like armies gathered around Europe. Some Germans followed a goose thought to be enchanted by God. It led them into Jewish neighborhoods, where they slaughtered the residents. Advancing Christian armies decapitated Muslims and catapulted the heads into besieged cities. Finally, the crusaders captured Jerusalem and massacred the populace. 
<br><br>
In the 1400s, the Inquisition turned its attention to witchcraft. Clerics declared that some women were having sex with Satan, transforming themselves into animals, flying through the sky at night, and casting hexes on godly folk. The number of "witches" tortured and executed over three centuries is estimated from 100,000 to 2 million.
<br><br>
From the 1500s, members of India's Thuggee sect strangled people because they believed that the goddess Kali wanted her followers to eliminate excess lives generated by Brahma the Creator. Thugs were garroting an estimated 20,000 victims a year in the 1800s until British rulers stamped out the religion. At an 1840 trial, one Thug was accused of sacrificing 931 people.
<br><br>
The Reformation triggered two centuries of religious war that took millions of lives. Eight Huguenot-Catholic wars ravaged France. Protestant-Catholic slaughter sundered the Low Countries. England suffered killings when the Anglicans broke with Rome -- then more killings when the Puritans broke with the Anglicans. The Thirty Years War brought the worst religious death toll of all time. Amid the Catholic-Protestant combat in Europe, both sides paused to kill Anabaptists for their crime of double baptism.  In the late 1800s and again during World War I, Muslim Turks and Christian Armenians killed each other by the hundreds of thousands.
<br><br>
In a tragic irony, the great pacifist Mahatma Gandhi forced the British to leave India in 1947 -- which freed Hindus and Muslims to set upon each other in a killing frenzy that cost perhaps a million lives. Outbreaks have continued ever since. For example, a pig walked through a Muslim holy ground at Moradabad in 1980. Muslims blamed Hindus for it, and subsequent rioting killed 200 people.
<br><br>
Currently doctors are murdered by those whose religious beliefs indicate that murdering one doctor is justified to save the lives of unborn children.
<br><br>
Why not have a religious war server?  It looks like history shows we have just as much difficulty resolving religion as we do race.
<br><br>
The reason I think we don't have a larger presence, in RPG's both online and PnP, is that the issue is kind of touchy.   It smacks of cults and the occult, and brings back memories (and the current realities) of those who accuse role-playing games as being instruments of the devil.  Who *really* wants to make up and enact dark elf rituals?  Troll rituals would be kind of fun, Auntie Moog seems to do it all the time.  Every morning, it's "BARSH BARSH BARSH!"  "BARSH, BARSH BARSH!" followed by a dunking in the swamp.
<br><br>
Also, we as a culture are pretty unfamiliar with a pantheon.  We've been influenced so heavily by a monotheistic religion that pantheistic beliefs seem a little silly to us, and it's hard to groove on.
<br><br>
But, this is one more very important part of the overall tapestry, which makes Norrath immersive, or not.  It's weakened by  EQ's dearth of mythology, by deities' names that pop up on servers which have no background, (Who is E'ci?).  It is an underused role-playing hook in EQ, a toss-off.  Deities were only recently added to a character's visible record, allowing for thousands of players who literally did not know because they had forgotten what should have been one of their character's most important life choices.  There are no religious festivals or days of worship in Norrath, either.
<br><br>
Religion should be a major part of most (not all) characters lives.  This governs most of how a role-played character looks at life, decides what is right or wrong, and behaves within the world.  It gives them an identity.  Without it, cleric characters are merely really talented doctors.
<br><br>
So, to re-launch the religion series, here are some articles to chew on:
