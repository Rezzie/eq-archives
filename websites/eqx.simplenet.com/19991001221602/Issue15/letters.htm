Dear Folks at EQX,
<br><br>
Just wanted to drop a note to congratulate you on an excellent article,
Role-playing <a href="../Issue14/monotheism.htm">Religion in EverQuest</a> by Oghma in Issue # 14.  My hope is
that EQ will attract lots of gamers who will actively partake of and
contribute to the mythology of the Norrath by asking the sorts of
questions Oghma does in the article about who their characters are, what
they believe, and how those beliefs should be expressed.  Thanks again
for your support of EQ.
<br><br>

I was reading the letters to the editor and one thing caught my attention
quick.  Preventing mule characters with only one character allowed per
server.  You see, my husband and I are both serious gamers, and being in
Alaska as we are, need to play on the closest server.  Therefore, 1
charachter per server would suck for us, and others like us.
Thanks and great site!

<em>[Ed: Have no fear, from what I know the folks producing EverQuest agree with you on this one, Casy.
Last I heard there would be 8 characters per account.]</em>

On the part about "VALID CREDIT CARD REQUIRED FOR GAME INSTALLATION. INTERNET CONNECTIVITY REQUIRED TO PLAY."   It say's this on one of the boxes I bought.  The other one I got was bought for my son so we could play at the same time.  It said "INTERNET CONNECTIVITY REQUIRED TO PLAY." .  OSI/EA should have pulled these boxes off the market, because it was false advertising.  The real sad part is I went into Compusa a week ago and they still had boxes that said this.  Just thought you would like to know.
