Hey I like Robert Jordan's series! hehe.  
<br><br>
It never seizes to amaze me how accurately you can nail a subject to the
wall and rip it wide ass open with your <a href="../Issue63/edita.htm">editorials</a>.  Just wanted to
congratulate you on another great issue.

 Hi there! 
<br><br>
Even if you're low on sleep, I think that covered most of the
short-sighted complaints I've seen everywhere recently. I think
your <a href="../Issue63/edita.htm">editorial</a> demonstrates the two broad mindsets that we'll
see. Those who can see the potential of so many people coming
together, and those who can't see the forest for the trees. I
always have trouble understanding those who refuse to consider
what a multi-player game can be. Some see other players as little
more than intelligent targets...no different from any other
monster or NPC in the game. 
<br><br>
Then there are those who understand the concept of community.
Sure, I'm looking forward to the wonderful world that Verant has
built for us. I've spent a great deal of time reading and posting
in newsgroups, talking to like-minded players and frankly, I'm
mostly looking forward to the interaction. I'll be excited if an
when my character reaches 50th level. It's the journey to that
point, surrounded by my friends and other inhabitants of Norrath
that will make the whole thing worthwhile.

 It's good to be the king.  Besides, it helps out when I have to post letters like...]</em>

I'm not the type of guy who gets easily shocked, but isn't this taking
it a bit far?
<br><br>
I'm of course referring to the history under "<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~webstudio/fdm/frames.htm/">an idea is born</a>".
<br><br>
I'm not a US citizen, but living outside the US, watching all the
problems you have with more murders in one day in one "normal" city than
most European countries have in one year, one can only wonder how
presumably grown up people can write anything like this. What do you
think a story like that can do to a child's imagination and their
understanding of right and wrong?
<br><br>
I know for a fact that EQ phase 4 has children down to the age of 7
playing. Do you think these, or anyone else for that matter, doesn't
read EQX?
<br><br>
I know that EQ is a roleplaying game of both good and evil fractions,
but nothing you can do in-game will ever compare to the story I just
read, never!
<br><br>

<em>[Ed. - So much to address in this letter...  I'll skip over the whole thing about how many murders we have in the United States, that's not relevant.  Obviously we don't think that we took it too far.  We wouldn't have put it up there if we did.  EverQuest is a game where the predominant activity is killing things.  I certainly understand if parents think that killing is not something that they want their children to read about or see in a game.  I'm in no position to tell anyone how to raise their children, having none of my own (it's all this geekiness that drives the chicks wild...).
<br><br>
Look, the whole intent is to portray the evil of the Teir'dal, and the F'leurs DuMal in particular.  You point out that EverQuest is a roleplaying game that includes both good and dark elements.  The dark elves are the epitome of that dark element.  In a way I guess your offense is a bit of praise, for we really did mean for the guild, it's activities and it's history to be very gruesome.
<br><br>
And, well, to be honest, I do think that there are a lot of folks in phase 4 that don't read EQX, but I'm glad to know that you think otherwise.  I, however, doubt that many of them are seven years old.  I'm not in the habit of apologizing for what we do, especially where I think we have done nothing wrong.  And while I am sorry that you were offended, if you sent me back in time to do it over, I'd do that same thing.  Of course, I'd also be a bit upset that you sent me to change a web site about a game instead of sending me back to high school so that I could have a second chance with that one lovely girl that dumped me (dang spiteful geekiness!)...
<br><br>
I don't mean to make light of something that seems to have upset one of our readers, but I honestly see nothing wrong with that tale.  In fact, it's a great story.  It really does portray the evil that is the F'leurs DuMal.
<br><br>
And one more thing that Oghma pointed out.  This is a part of the NDA, any phase 4 tester that has played has agreed to it:
<br><br>
1.  Accounts are available only to adults or, in their discretion, their
minor child.  If you are a minor, your parent(s) or guardian(s) must
complete the registration process, in which case they will take full
responsibility for all obligations under this Agreement. By clicking the "I
Accept" button you represent that you are an adult and are either accepting
this Agreement on behalf of yourself or your child.
<br><br>
So parents have made a decision to allow their child access to all the killing on 
EverQuest.  We should not be put in the role of the parent.]</em>

I loved your article, I think it is great that you both love RPG's I
think you should get another computer at any cost, network them, and get
a cable modem. It is the only solution. Build your own if you have to
but you only have 2 more weeks.!

Bravo
<br><br>
Thanks for contributing your story "<a href="../Issue63/posy.htm">Posy</a>" to issue 63.  Your 
professional writing style and ability to stay within the bounds of EQ
gameplay while telling a good story are unmatched in my experience of 
the fansites.
<br><br>
Well done, Chris

I have been reading your editorials and tales on EQX for some time now,
and have always enjoyed them a great deal. One of the things I like the
most is that your stories rarely center upon your character and what he
is doing, but rather you are there as an addition to the main story.
Like a supporting role. Very few stories I have read take this approach
to storytelling, and it helps to make you stand out as one of the better
fiction writers in the EQ community. I feel as though I have travelled
with your Dwarven Cleric myself for a long time, or at least spent alot
of time with a bard that has. I hope to some day run across Oghma the
Dwarven Cleric in my travels through Norrath, as any encounter I have
with him is sure to be a truly great adventure.
<br><br>
Keep up the great writing...
