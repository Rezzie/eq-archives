<I><B>Q:</B>Will RedEye send an EQ manual with the Phase 4 CD?  If not, how are we supposed to know all the commands?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>There is a text file that comes on the CD.  It can be opened and read from Windows, or accessed through the HELP button while in the game.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Does the character's race affect their running speed?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>No, all races run at the same speed.  This is very useful for keeping your party together.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Can necromancers bring dead strong creatures back to life on their side?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Not in the way you describe.  Necromancers don't exactly raise the dead corpses of their fallen enemies.  Instead, they collect the components needed for their summonings, and create a brand new undead creature.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Will someone need to know double attack in order to use dual wield?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>No, these are two separate skills.  Double attack allows you to hit twice for each weapon you are using.  Dual wield allows you to use a second weapon.  With just one of these skills, you get two attacks when they trigger.  With both skills, and two weapons, you can get up to four attacks.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Could a warrior kick and use a shield or dual wield at the same time?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Yes, kick does not depend on your equipment at all, and is a free attack whenever you are able to click the button.  In combination with the skills described above, a combat skill such as kick can allow you to get up to five attacks in one round.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Is EverQuest based in part on any particular MUD?  Most MUDs are designed to "kill the monster, get the treasure."  Is this all EverQuest will offer or will there be more to the game?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>EverQuest is not based on any one MUD.  You may see influences from MUDs and other online games, as the design team has taken the best pieces of everything they have experienced and enjoy.  EQ can be merely a hack and slash game, if you choose it to be, but it does offer much more.  As the name of the game implies, quests will be a large part of the game as well.  This will allow you to learn the history and the people of Norrath while gaining experience and items as well.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>When you die, do you get to see stuff happening around your body, or are you immediately transported to your home town?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>When you get knocked unconscious, you will have a top-down view of your lifeless body, be able to see things that are close to it, and watch the text scroll by.  It is a helpless feeling to continue seeing those monsters hitting your body, but you always maintain hope that a cleric will pass by and heal you.  However, if you die, you will instantly begin loading the zone of your bind point, and will not see anything happen.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>The whole concept of Trolls and Ogres are to go out, barsh stuff, and eat it.  Why is it then, that Trolls and Ogres can't eat any more of their kills than say, a high elf?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Correction, YOUR concept of Trolls and Ogres are to go out, barsh stuff, and eat it.  The design team's concept is apparently to go out, barsh stuff, take what's useful, and then barsh some more.  You are free, however, to role-play whatever you wish.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Is there any way of building a time machine and traveling forward in time to March 16th, 1999?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Yes, and you can build it out of toothpicks.  Here's what you do.  Every morning at precisely 6:37am PST, place a toothpick in a bowl.  If you do this once a day, before you have 60 toothpicks, you will be able to reach your desired date in time.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Will there be role-playing awards given out randomly by GMs in the final version of EQ?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>No, there is no fair way to do this, and would only cause resentment and accusations of favoritism.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>How will expansion of the game be handled?  Will it be in the form of additional CDs or downloadable patches or will they be entirely server based?  If patch based, how large will the patches be?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>I can tell you how expansion worked during beta, but only speculate as to how expansion will work in final.  During beta, when a new zone was released, it would be downloaded through the normal patch mechanism.  Each zone is several megabytes of data, and so this will not be a common thing in final.  The design team is focusing now on the final released product, and not dealing with expansion sets at this time.  However, it is possible that expansion sets will be available if EQ gains the popularity it deserves.  This may be available for purchase at your local vendor, or perhaps ordered online.  We'll have to wait and see.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>When you /consider an NPC, does the answer weigh the current buffing spells on you and any special weapon you might have equipped?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>No, /consider appears to take only the level into account.  

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>Is there a place to store your extra equipment so if you die you won't lose everything you've worked for?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>Yes, there are banks in every home city.  In the bank, you can store coins and up to 8 items.  Of course, if these 8 items are containers, such as a backpack or box, you can store items inside them as well.  You can easily get well over 50 item slots for storage this way.
