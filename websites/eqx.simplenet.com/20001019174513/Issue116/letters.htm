<a href="../Issue114/legwork.htm">Onnie's Article</a> in issue 114...
<br><br>
I just want to say.. THANK you! I play on the Tunare Server, and frankly, no one does anything there! Everyone is stuck in their own circles, never hunting with anyone new, or powerlevelling secondaries...
 <br><br>
Tunare used to be a great place. Everyone helped everyone else. Now.. most of the good people have left for greener pastures because of the rudeness and apathy there. Those of us who often try to help others usually get a rude gesture or not even a thank you.
 <br><br>
There are rarely ever events on Tunare, because no one wants to do the leg work. Take for instance, my ex-guild. They were riddled with problems and internal strife, yet no one cared.. .escpecially the leader. It was simply put on the back burner and forgotten about. They had a couple of allied guilds, but nothing was ever done with them. The officers had their own little circle and everyone else was pretty much left out in the cold unless they were useful to them.
 <br><br>
THIS is the mentality of Tunare. Few care about others... I can't count the times I have seen people simply watch while others die..
 <br><br>
As for me? I'm just a simple bard with a heart of gold... I try to help when I can.. regardless of the thanks I get or lack thereof.
 <br><br>
I wish Tunare was a community instead of a bunch of people fighting for space.

"The one image that made <a href="../Issue115/comic14.htm">this weeks comic</a> truly hilarious is the panel with
Gargatox wearing a Halfling deputy hat. I nearly fell off my chair laughing
(you should carry a warning label on your comic; Warning:Do not read unless
you are firmly secured in your chair. In some studies readers have fallen
and injured themselves.) 
<br><br>
I always laugh at deputies. They look like the "Hamburglar"! I wish I could
loot those masks and hats. I could then run around Misty Thicket yelling
"Robald Robald" (why does the hamburglar say that?). 
<br><br>
That brings me to the point of this e-mail, a suggestion. The one thing
Bard's Log does not have enough of is (drumroll please): Gargatox in hats.
Hats are funny, especially wierd hats. Case in point: Gargatox wearing the
Dark Elf skull helmet (and the skulls...erm...facial expressions). Funny
hats can lend a sureally funny element to a situation, especially adorned
by surreally funny characters... More garg in hats."

"Thanks for making Everquest something I have a grin about rather than a cry
about. I know after a particularly unfair death (lagged near some griffins
lets say) that a quick look at bards log makes me smile and dive back in.
Keep it up and I hope you never run out of ideas."

Hi,
<br><br>
Interest article regarding reality.  However, that question has been
asked since the beginning of philosophy and was perhaps best answered by
Descartes.  In Meditions, Descartes doubted everything.  However, in the
end, he found the one truth, the only infallible one.  Even in doubting
his own existence, he is thinking.  Therefore, he stated "I think, I
am", which peope has always mistranslated as "Cognito Ergo Sum".  That
basic truth has no need of a proof.  It is a self-evident truth,
probably the only one philosophy has found.  If this self-evident truth
does not sound reasonable to you, then all I can say is, "You do not
exist".  To me, it sounds very reasonable.  Of course, you might say,
"Self-evident truth?  That's BS!".  However, Godel has already proven
that there exist statements such that it cannot be proven neither truth
or false.  And in mathematics, we have "axioms" which are considered
self-evident truth with no need for prove.  That's what philosophy is
all about, searching for that self-evident truth.
