Let us pray.
<br><br>
No, really, let us pray.  Maybe what I mean is let us worship.  EverQuest has twenty-three gods, fifteen which have been defined on the EverQuest website and nine which have been added as server names.  When I read community posts about clerics, or I look at the cleric handbooks and the cleric websites, the gods are never mentioned.  I know that there is no difference in the spells given to priests by the various gods, but there should be some sort of difference in behavior.  I'm not sure that is only a role-players issue, either.
<br><br>
Religion and myth are part of what we all breathe in daily life.  Our superstitions, our jokes, and how we view the world are all defined by the myths and fairy tales we heard as children.  The desire to excel beyond our beginnings, our beliefs of justice, kindness and evil - all these things come from our youth and define how we act.  There are dozens and dozens of religious systems we can believe in, and thousands of stories which help define them.  Even the positions of an agnostic or atheist requires a religious belief to stand in opposition or  skepticism.
<br><br>
Right now the different priesthoods affect the game only as a faction.  That can be pretty important as part of a quest - items are plain taken away by npcs if your faction is too low to complete the quest, and some of these items are hard-won indeed.  Some factions should be even stricter, and almost impossible to gain - could a Troll ever, ever gain enough faction with the Clerics of Tunare to achieve a holy item? Remember, in Norrath religion is a bit different than real life - we have, in RL, the ability to switch religions easily, because faith is more difficult to achieve in a deep sense.  In Norrath, the gods are <b>there</b>, they've been seen, and they do things.  Kill a fish in Qeynos and Rodcet Nife is… displeased.
<br><br>
Religion and myth, though, should more than a faction - they should be the Norrathian background against which all events occur. They are already, but we just don't know it because we don't have enough information.  What the heck are froglocks? Where are they from?  Why do they have a huge temple?  What's up with green and blue orcs? Someone run out of yellow?  These are all clues to how to understand Norrath in a non-game mechanics and useful way, which would help all gamers.
<br><br>
There are currently about 500 known quests in the game, and this is another way we can get information about Norrath's history.  Not only that, it can be an excellent source of stories and ongoing story-lines.  Unravel the complicated relationships between gnolls and the Qeynos militia through the quests available and you learn an excellent tale.  Some of the quests are now quite complex, involving npc movement and difficult loyalties.  I've chased a certain NPC all over West commons after he stole something from another NPC while I was talking to him. Oof!
<br><br>
On the EQ web site, there are also two histories written - a creation myth, and the story of Miragul.  So, to total it up: one creation myth, one small history, fifteen defined gods, nine unknown gods, five hundred quests. We need more myths, and more histories.  How can there be eight gods we know nothing about? (They are, by the way, Ec'I  Fennin Ro, Povar, Tarew Marr, The Rathe, The Nameless, Xegony, Tallon and Vallon Zek.   Any information we have on them are off-hand comments like Vallon and Tallon are Rallos's relatives. Please chastise me if I've missed something.)
<br><br>
So, what we here at EverQuest Express would like to do is call for original myths and legends based on the gods, races, and places of Norrath, and histories involving NPC's (without spoilers).  We'd like to create a mythology, stories of Gods and Heroes, Dragons and Tricksters.   Who is Lord Nagfagen, and why does he reside in Solusek?  Why do froglocks hate trolls? Who was Dagnor, and what's his Cauldron? Let's take the characters, names and places that we are given and create a tapestry, full of the rich fabric of Norrath, woven with the threads of intrigue and heroism.  Let us know of other links with such tales, too - I'm not the only myth nut in EverQuest.  Hopefully we can get something good together for our Issue 100!
