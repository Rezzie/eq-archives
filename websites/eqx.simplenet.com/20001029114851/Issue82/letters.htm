After visiting www.eqvault.com and seeing the article about EQX there i quickly went there and have been astounded by the stories there (especially by Aklar's Rogue: A tale of Treachery. This is a commendation to Aklar mainly as I have just finished reading the 8th update to the story and have to say that it has a good storyline and i cant wait for the next instalment! now if only Rogues in EQ could do that, eh? =]

Hi,
<br><br>
I just finished reading most of your articles on EQX, especially the ones on
roleplaying and I was very impressed. I am a freelance writer in the pen and
paper RPG industry (I've done work for White Wolf and DP9 among others) and
I got into EQ to check it out. The whole question of roleplaying vrs
powergaming is extremely interesting, especially the track Verdant seems to
be taking. But this debate has existed forever in relation to RPG -- the
difference between "roll" players and "role" players. The difference with EQ
is that you don't get to choose who you play with (like you would in a
normal p&p RPG); it's not like your typical Sunday afternoon game with the
regulars. I am curious to see how it will end and I can understand your
anger.
<br><br>
How would I go about getting into the roleplaying community of EQ? I've
spent the last week, between brakes on my current deadline, checking web
sites and I haven't found anything close -- except EQX which is why I am
asking. It's taken me a while to learn the ropes and now I feel I am ready
to jump in and do some good roleplaying, but frankly I do not know where to
start.
<br><br>
Keep up the good work on EQX, I am just sorry it took me so long to find it.
<br><br>
Thanks
<br><br>

<a href="../edito.htm">Reply to Oghma about his editorial (7/4/99)</a>
<br><br>
As you may know, my "first" character has been and ever shall be a
Dwarven Paladin of Brell in Everquest. As Oghma is to you, Simeron
Steelhammer is to me. I know him as well as I know myself. His likes and
dislikes, even his most favorite drink, warm honey mead with a cinnamon
stick. I have a history for him and a background that I take great pride
in regardless of the game he is in. One of the things that he has a
problem with is gifts. Not giving them, getting them. I had this problem
for a VERY long time until someone, a player I have adventured with for
ages, explained something to me that struck home through this thick
dwarven skull of mine.
<br><br>
Why do you give things to others?
<br><br>
If your reasons are like my own, its to help them survive and prosper
better. Then he asked the question you probably already figured out...I
didn't see it coming....
<br><br>
Then why would you deny this pleasure to your friends?
<br><br>
Now, my head REALLY hurt on this one because I had to do some hard and
long thinking. I never came up with a good answer and if you do, please
tell me...*8).
<br><br>
But, I do agree that something very powerful may make a character over
"tweaked". So, here are some suggestions I use.
<br><br>
If I am given a very powerful item that in reality Simeron simply could
not get on his own or with a guild hunt, I accept the gift and thank the
person deeply but inform them, I don't feel I deserve the priviledge of
using the item just yet. I shall place it in the safety of my vault at
the bank and at such time as I feel I am worthy of the gift, I will
begin using it.
<br><br>
Or the above senario but wait for Brell to tell you its time by gaining
the ability of more powerful miracles (higher level IOW). Something
along those lines.
<br><br>
In this way, you can accept the gift without having to unbalance your
RPing of Oghma.
<br><br>
Hope this helps...good luck.

Some musings about idiocy
<br><br>
We can all identify to ourselves what constitutes an jerk. Although it varies to a certain degree from person to person, certain things can be agreed apon. Somone who trains on purpose or out of ignorance/incompetence is a jerk. somone who steals kills and doesn't apologise is a jerk. Somone who speaks d00dish and insults other players for RPing will generally be a jerk. We all know, but verant, like most other MMORPG creaters, refuses to police the game--Probably because of the huge job it would be for the already understaffed GMs--and at the same time prevents us from policing ourselves. I read the thing about JL in issue 81, and I found it intriguing, but a bit too abusable. I'm not exactly sure how I'd do it better.
 <br><br>
I was a Councilor/GM on several player run servers for UO. *ducks thrown garbage* They weren't very large, but we had a fairly good representation of the MMORPG community. (People who disliked UO for the lack of RPing, people who quit because of the bad customer service, people who still played on the OSI servers, but wanted a change of pace, and people who had been banned from the OSI servers.) I know that I, and the other GMs there could tell within 30 seconds of talking with somone whether they were a good person, or a jerk. Even there our hands were tied somewhat, but we could still take a dislike to the person, and that person wouldn't get as much out of the server as the people we liked. Call it favoritism? maybe. But I like to think that it made the game more enjoyable for the majority of people in the game when a roleplayer finds a chest in the woods containing a map to a treasure, a bunch of kewld00ds go to camp it and get a Daemon for their troubles. 
 <br><br>
Bringing this back to EQ, I think that the first thing to do about this problem is to get more GMs. at least on Innoruuk where I play there are very few, and they are swamped. The few who I have talked with have been very nice, and I would trust their judgment. Then you would need to give the GMs a little more carrot/stick power. The ability to reward good, cooperative behavior(I'd tend to encourage roleplaying, but I know many non-rpers who are very nice.) and punish bad. There would be many complaints about favoritism and corruption, but aren't there already? I think it would make alot of people more inclined to play if they saw a nasty kewldood level 30 running around the newbie zones stealing kills aproached by a GM and warned to stop.
 <br><br>
I'm sure there are alot of problems with this, and I'm sure I'll have them pointed out to me, and I'm sure that this won't get done. But what can ya do?
