most of our members are very active on all the message boards along with many different EQ IRC channels

How many members would make your guild the ideal size?

<td style="text-align: justify">Before beta starts we have a 25 member limit but after the open beta and final get
underway we hope to expand to around 35 seeing as to they are good RPers we don't want
200 members just enough to be able to have a couple members online at a given time so
members have other to adventure with.<br><br></td>

Finally, tell us a little about what your guild will get up to in the game.
</td>

<td valign="top"><b>Saturnino:</b></td>
<td style="text-align: justify"> Well....&nbsp;&nbsp;
the main purpose of our guild will to go on huge quests all over Norrath and
the many other dimensions beyond that... we will most likely set up a fort or
2 (seeing as to that possible) and also have tavern located in several towns to
make money and to hang out other than that we will be doing anything else that
is fun (in a non annoying way) hopefully there will be many uncharted waters for
us to sail and map and many a quest to buy our time and of course many a brew to
quench our thirst.</td>
