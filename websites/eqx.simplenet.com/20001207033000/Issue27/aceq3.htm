This is not the case at all, the basic paridigm is that you select a target
(either through keyboard or mouse controls), then attack, a power bar creaps
up and you are given a choice of high/medium or low attack. This can be
triggered by either the mouse or the keyboard.

Also, the client does not decide if you hit or miss - that would be an
incredibly stupid thing to do in a MMP game. As for latency screwing with the
system, we have an auto-combat feature that alows users to just select a
target and let the server take over. The difference between AC and EQ in
this regard, is that we give you the choice as to weather you want to use
this auto-combat system or not - it's up to the player if they want to
control everything or not.

<em>The magic system in Asheron's Call is as much of a joke as its combat
system. It is a recipe system, where mages spend a significant amount of time
sitting around with lots of spell components mixing and testing, mixing and
testing. If the mage gets lucky, she could discover a brand new and powerful
spell that no one else knows. Apparently there is a system to the madness,
where a particular ingredient is always associated with Fire, for example,
which could help in figuring out the spells. It is the developers' hope that
mages will keep their findings secret, since they are more powerful if they
are the only one with a particular spell.</em>
