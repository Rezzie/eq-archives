    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Greetings. 
      I am Adicus, a grand ol' mage from Freeport, and I fear that I have a problem. 
      It is like this , lass, I'm a Mage , and part of being a Mage is the pride 
      you get from all the skills you have apart from most of the population, 
      such as my favorite, Gate. Aye , but alot of that pride is gone now , for 
      ye see , a problem has developed, it first happened some time ago , and 
      it keped happening. It first happened when i was traveling with a druid 
      friend of mine. Our journey was taking longer than expected , so he offered 
      to use his Gate skill, he started casting , and i started feeling quite 
      ill. I felt ill untill we reached the other side of the portal. Aye , it 
      was very unpleasant from that monent after , and it seems the only thing 
      that can calm down my illness is a good , tall, frosty mug of ale. I thaught 
      this was isolated at first , but it hapened again , and again , and again. 
      Often enough my meals revisit me, making me very unpopular with my friends. 
      The effect is even starting to spread to my gate skill, and yet , the only 
      thing that helps me is ale. I have visited all of the great clerics and 
      shamans of the world , and they do not know what my illness is. I have heard 
      you are a wise and grand lass , who is wise beyond your years, and that 
      you might be able to help me.<br>

      I am all powerful doesn't meen i'm givin out money! All they do is ask for 
      money! Once I was waiting for a friend, and a pesent came up to me and said 
      "gimme money", I of course said no then he got all pissy and tried to get 
      a herd of ghouls to attack me by attacking them and leading them to me! 
      but got rescued by a bunch of heros in the prosses and got madder and then 
      got the attention of a hill giant, but this time had a Druid cast a spell 
      on him to make him run faster. SO i had to kill the hill giant, I got MORE 
      money and he got madder! Why are pesents now aday so damn mad about getting 
      free money! It's like you have to BRIBE em to get them to shadup and stop 
      getting strong monsters to attack you! Please help!</i></font></p>

      and thanks for the letter. Hmm, maybe you are right, I have always enjoyed 
      the bashin, hehe, but still.... I just feel awfully lonely at night sometimes. 
      I talked to my daughter Valestra, and we exchanged letters and... LOL, she 
      thought you and me??? ROFL!!! You're a great companion for the bashin, but 
      for the lovin... I dunno about that. It also said you broke your desk. So 
      I have enclosed 20pp with this letter so you can buy a new one. Between 
      you and me, if anyone needs someone to "keep them in line" it would be my 
      daughter. She's like a little bundle of indigo chaos. Truly a handful, I 
      tell ya. Probably gets it from her mother....</font></i></p>
