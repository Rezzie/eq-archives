I'm not sure that there is a worse stench at three in the morning than that of orc livers in hyacinth butter.  The combination of dirty meat aged well past the time when it's safe to eat and the floral odor of fresh cut hyacinth mix to make a reek that only a troll could love.
<br><br>
Herkut was in the kitchen and I could hear a number of other trolls wandering around shoeless, their nails dragging on the wood flooring of the Murkwood Inn.  I'm not one for staying at rustic inns, but the Murkwood is the exception.  Mostly because it's the only place where Herkut and I can meet without having guards chase one or the other of us out.  And while I find Herkut to be one of the most intelligent beings I've ever come across, I do take umbrage with his choice of breakfasts.
<br><br>
So did my stomach.  I rushed to the nearest window, leaned out, and let the mix of alcohol and last night's roast basilisk fly.
<br><br>
Herkut poked his head in the door to the room where I knelt with my head out the window.
<br><br>
"Now that be way to react to me cooking?  Me brung basilisk fresh from ButcherBlock."
<br><br>
I shot him a look of irritation.  He had a smile on his face.  Not the usual smile trolls adorn that says 'I'm wondering what you'll look like without a head', but the good familiar smile of a troll who enjoys the petty little tortures.  Like making the world's worst smelling breakfast.
<br><br>
By the time I came to the kitchen the other trolls had departed.  Only Herkut sat there, shoveling bits of orc into his face, spitting out the petals.  I sat down at the table and ignored the smells and sights.
<br><br>
"So why am I here?"
<br><br>
He chewed a moment.  The only troll I ever knew who didn't talk with his mouth full.  And I was thankful.
<br><br>
"Me not client this time.  Take you to client.  After breakfast."
<br><br>
"Do I get to know who?"
<br><br>
He smirked.  Or at least I think that was a smirk.  It could have been mistaken for indigestion.  But he kept eating without answering.
<br><br>

Some hikes are pleasant strolls through the garden the gods have made of this world.  Others are exhausting death marches that leave you looking no further than the tip of your shoes.
<br><br>
This trip was like a dwarf in a shower; Unbelievable and hairy.
<br><br>
In case I've never mentioned this, I personally hate the Karanas.  More varieties of griffin than I have changes of underwear.  And after a couple of close scrapes, I needed some of those changes.
<br><br>
But eventually Herkut began to slow down, as if satisfied that nothing was going to kill us before we reached our goal.  And our final destination proved to be as strange as a halfling with a longbow.
<br><br>
"Us be here," Herkut called out as we approached a tremendous tree on a hill, as if he were trying to pre-empt and ambush.  I kept my eyes open in case those he called to did not hear.
<br><br>
Then a deep, rough voice came.
<br><br>
"Approach and bring the investigator."
<br><br>
Herkut stepped forward.  He was able to see clearly in the growing dusk, but I had to light a lantern first and approach where Herkut had reached.
<br><br>
"Keep the flame low, please," said the deep voice.
<br><br>
Before me was something I had only heard of in legends.  Atop the hill deep in the Karanas was a tree with a face.
<br><br>
"You are the investigator?"
<br><br>
I nodded as I lowered the flame a bit.  I'm guessing most trees have an aversion to fire, though this is the first one I'd encountered that could voice it.
<br><br>
"Why am I here," I asked.
<br><br>
"I am the last of my kind.  I am an elder treant, and thus able to speak.  But a few days ago someone approached behind me when my worshippers had stepped away to hunt, and began to hack at me with an axe.  I had great difficulty holding him off with my limbs when I could not see him behind me.  I fear that whatever assassin came for me then will come back at another time.  I ask that you find out who he is so that my followers may take care of him."
<br><br>
"Followers," I asked.
<br><br>
That was when a number of figures came out of the shadows.  Each was well armed.  Numerous druids among them.  Each had a grim expression.
<br><br>
I nodded.
<br><br>
"I'll do my best.  But first I have a few questions.  Do your people hunt at the same time every night?"
<br><br>
"We hunt at dawn and again at dusk," said one of the figures.
<br><br>
"Do you all go when you hunt?"
<br><br>
"Not typically."
<br><br>
"So who stayed behind during the last hunt?"
<br><br>
An old women stumbled forward accompanied by a barbarian man.  She was a typical crone, with misshapen faces and humped back, with a smile like a rusty saw.  The barbarian had the dull look of a northern born warrior, and the many scars to back up that theory.
<br><br>
"Did you see anything of the perpetrator?"
<br><br>
The crone stepped forward and looked at me with her good eye.
<br><br>
"I saw only a shadow retreating into the hills.  My eye ain't what it used to be."
<br><br>
"And I saw nothing, as I was preparing a fire to cook the evening's hunt," said the barbarian.
<br><br>
Naturally they would make the fire some distance away because of the fear of harming the treant.
<br><br>
"I guess I have only one last question for now," I said and turned back to the treant and asked, "Do you have any enemies?"
<br><br>
"There are few who know of me.  Of those, most are my followers.  A few months back there were some dark elves here, and my followers ran them off."
<br><br>
"I will investigate and report back," I said.
<br><br>
I then checked out the wound on the back of the tree.  The marks were long and straight, perhaps indicating a large blade or an axe.  I eliminated the possibility of an animal attack, as the marks seemed independent-not the parallel marks of a set of claws.  Seemed that the blows were all made in the same place, and the blows ran parallel to the ground.  Probably an axe, as if someone were chopping him down.
<br><br>
I consulted with Herkut for a moment.
<br><br>
"Me thinks dark elves," said the troll.
<br><br>
I shook my head in disagreement.
<br><br>
"Dark elves are the convenient enemy.  If you've seen one nearby and your crops go bad, naturally it was the dark elves.  I think the enemy is within.  Let's get the group together and I'll let them know what I think all at once."
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
It was an hour later that they called the entire gathering together and I began to espouse my theory.
<br><br>
"The wounds on our friend here are quite obviously made in a chopping motion.  It seems to me that the intent was do bring him down.  There are a few obvious uses for trees that are chopped down.  Housing, which would seem unlikely here.  My first thought was perhaps they sought to make magical weapons from the wood of a treant, but now I have another theory."
<br><br>
I turned down the lantern until its light was out.  There in the darkness I had trouble seeing much of anything, but Herkut went to the duty which I had asked him to perform.  
<br><br>
It was a moment before Herkut said "Turn the lights back up."
<br><br>
The wood elves and several others had plenty of opportunity to witness what was happening, but humans, such as myself, were left in the dark until the light came back up.  And when the lights arose, I was standing alone, while Herkut was standing beside the barbarian who had stayed behind during the hunt in question.
<br><br>
"May I see your weapons," I asked the barbarian.  He removed his dagger from its sheath, and I asked, "Is that all you use?  A big man such as yourself and all you use is a dagger?"
<br><br>
He looked around nervously.  He was not clever enough to come up with a lie, but his head was working.  If one looked closely, they could see the wisps of steam come from his ears.
<br><br>
The barbarian backed up.  But the crowd behind him did not disperse and he merely bumped into them.
<br><br>
He looked around then said, "I meant no harm.  Really!  I would never hurt him intentionally."
<br><br>
"I know," I said, "You were left alone just before dusk and told you would build that night's fire.  When they were long gone away, you realized you had no lantern or torches left, so you stumbled about in the darkness looking for wood to start the fire with.  After having very little luck, you eventually came upon a tree.  You had your axe, so it would perhaps be better to cut down some wood.  The druids would object, but none were around and this would give you ample time to get the wood back and for you to start the fire.  Only…"
<br><br>
"Only, I had wandered the wrong direction in the dark.  I had wandered back here, and the tree I struck… was… alive."
<br><br>
The crowd mumbled between them.  I heard the words "lynch" and "behead" used.
<br><br>
"It was an accident," he implored and turned toward the treant, "It was an accident!!"
<br><br>
He fell to his knees and set his hands on the roots of the treant, who eventually spoke.
<br><br>
"Yes, the tree was alive.  But you must learn that ALL trees are alive.  I can speak and they cannot, but they are alive nonetheless."
<br><br>
One of the worshippers stepped forward and asked the treant, "What do we do, master?  It was you who was wronged, albeit by accident.  What shall we do with him?"
<br><br>
The treant seemed to ponder an appropriate response and then spoke at last.
<br><br>
"Your crime was not against me, I was incidental.  Your crime was against all trees.  You will go to Surefall Glade and seek out the druids there.  You will go alone.  Tell them your tale, and act by their judgement.  If they allow you to return, bring the seal of the guild and you will be accepted back here.  If you choose only to run away then you should never return here or you will be killed."
<br><br>
"Thank you," said the barbarian, obviously feeling that he had at least temporarily had a stay of execution.
<br><br>
"Investigator, I thank you," said the treant, "You will always be welcome here."
<br><br>
Great, I thought, I'll be back as soon as they invent griffin repellant.
