Is this the way it always is?  You're new to a gaming group.  They seem like nice enough folks, and the seem to actually want you to join them.  So you drive through the hot California sun for over an hour to join them at their weekly game.  You have to make a character, so while you do that they try to finish up what was going on last week and try to find a spot where you can join.
<br><br>
Then, even when you have your character done (which wasn't easy to do because you always have to ask questions of the GM, and he's running the rest of them), they still aren't at a place where you can get in.  Then you get hungry and you run out for food.  You come back to find that they are juuust about ready to get you in the game…

We were nearly back in town when party hell broke out.  My silly brother, playing an egomaniacal Minotaur, decided that we were turning against him when I tried to trade our Human prisoner to the Elves for 200 gold.  200 gold!  Heck, we've never even SEEN that much gold.  And the Human was just eating our food.  And the prisoner was not even his!  It was the prisoner of the other Minotaur (yup, two of them, sheesh!).  So, after much arguing the other Minotaur (the white one) decided to let his prisoner go free.  Well, this brought the behemoths to blows, while the Human escaped.  Me, I flew/herded the Human toward the Elves and made the trade anyhow.  I came back with the cash to see that egomaniacal Minotaur was taking a lions share of the treasure and heading off to the humanoid settlement on his own.

All this delayed getting our new players in even longer!

Sorry, but that's what happened this weekend.  We had two new players and we really never let them play!  It always seems to happen with new players.  They are usually a bit shy, and that makes it tough for them to get involved even when they get into the game.  There is just a lot of adjustments that you have to make to a new game.  I just hope we didn't run our two newbies off (well, newbies to our game anyhow).  They say they plan to come back…  Hehe.  But they have the nice GM now, let's see if they last through the old one…  Muwahahaha  …

This is bound to be a problem in EverQuest as well.  Now, those that are testing the game now (snot nosed little… ) not only have an obligation put upon them by 989 Studios to test the game, but when the next wave of testers starts in, they have a moral obligation to help them out as well.  They will need to know where not to go (there be bears thataway!), how to get where they do want to go, and all sorts of other stuff.  It's a shame to have a bunch of folks fumbling around when there are plenty of other folks that have already fumbled around enough.
