Work faster!
<br><br>
Bard's Log is the funniest game-themed online comic in existence! Not as
if there are many competitors, but you certainly beat out Dank and Scud (unfortunately now a horde of Quake players are going to hunt me down and eviscerate me). Well, to make the point I originally set out to make: WORK FASTER! You kept me waiting for TWO WEEKS and all I get is one panel! Albeit a very funny one panel, but still! Yes I understand you have a real life, but so do I. My hobby is writing so I understand why it would take you so long and you'd need the occasional vacation. But anyways that doesn't stop me from sending you e-mails like this.<br>
MWUH-HAH-HAH-HAH!!!!!!!
<br><br>
 OK that's all.

Thanks for putting out such a great newsletter.  I'd like to thank Archanalia and Sir Maximus for thier hilarous comics.  But about all, the best part is the Fit to Print sponsors.  Keep up the good work.

I read <a href="../Issue110/edita.htm">Absor's editorial</a> in issue 110, and as I read through the letter in
the editorial, tears came to my eyes. I have a friend who had Hodgkins and
my grandfather died of stomach cancer before I was born, so I can almost
imagine I can relate to this man's story. I an relate to it slightly
because of my own use of Everquest. I believe that people use games, books,
and movies to escape from the reality of their own lives. They might do it
to escape from either the bad reality of their lives, such as the person
who wrote that letter, or simply from the dull monotony. I don't know about
other people, but when I play EQ for a few moments I AM Udias the elven
druid or Beldarus the barbarian warrior. Its an escapee from the aspects of
life we don't like, and it's also a way to reach out and make friends.
Every time someone does something nice for me in EQ, I somehow remember
their names and I have a great longing to see them again. This isn't
anything like the random chattering of chat rooms. This is a whole other
existence in a way. Everquest is truly a great thing for people who have
problems. It won't make cancer go away or make a cripple walk, but it can
do directly what walking and health do indirectly: it can make someone
happy. I think that for any entertainer this is the greatest goal, a kind
of mission. Happiness. Thanks for all the fun.
