It's very late, and I am very tired.  And yet I still sit at my computer to write an editorial for this week's issue.  I must really love EQX.  Let's hope that I can keep my eyes open for the duration.  If you hear any snoring, give me a few minutes then wake me up.  After all, I have work to do here.
<br><br>
I thought I'd take a poke at some of the issues that are bouncing around the community.  The closer we come to the release of EverQuest, the more there seems to be to talk about.  All of us are on edge, that's for certain.  A lot of us feel that there is a lot resting on the success or, gasp, failure of this game.  For Verant the connection is obvious.  For those of us that have been lucky enough to invest a lot of our time in testing this game there is a similar connection.  I know that I feel like it's as much my baby as it is Verants.  I'm a fool, of course, but I still feel that way.  It's hard to put so many hours into a project, even if you're just a tester, and not want to see it be a success.  For those eagerly awaiting the release of EverQuest the investment isn't much less.  In a way it's more visceral and much more edgy.  You've been itching just to <b>see</b> the game, and you've got an emotional investment in all the waiting that you've done.  You'll be as devastated as anyone if EverQuest isn't what you wanted it to be.
<br><br>
And so, only a few weeks from release, tensions are running high.  And questions, accusations and innuendo are sprouting all over the place.  For some of you the answers to these ordeals are obvious, and you don't need to hear what I have to say about it.  Well, heck, that's fine.  But it's really you that I'm talking to.  It's those that have made up their minds that I want to jostle a bit.
<br><br>
RANT: <b>What!  They've burned the release CDs already?</b>
<br><br>
Sub RANT: <b>But the game still has TONS of bugs!  It's not anywhere near ready?</b>
<br><br>
Hehe, this one amuses me.  Sure, there are still some things that need fixing.  But if you're thinking that they won't be fixed by release, then you don't know the Verant Dev Team.  Yes, no doubt there will be some bugs, even at release.  But you have to keep in mind what Brad pointed out on some message board somewhere (sorry, I can't remember where... remember, it's late, and I'm VERY tired).  A lot of what people think are bugs are really extra features that may not make final.  I hear that there are problems with some of the Illusion series of spells.  You know what, it's that very set of spells that made me so excited about EQ.  Now I think they'll be fixed in time.  But you know what, I'll still play an enchanter in final, even if they can't cast illusions.  The initial FAQ for EQ said there would be over 100 spells, and we all gasped.  Now there are over 800!  So if a few don't make it for final, it's an incomplete feature, not a bug.
<br><br>
As for the rest, I've seen the Dev Team squish a slew of nasty bugs in a 24 hour period.  I know that they sometimes work all night getting things fixed.  I can guess that right now I'm only about half as tired as they are.  It's midnight in California.  I betcha there are still a lot of Verant employee up right now working on the game.  Let's hold off on the screams about failure until it actually happens.  I don't think you'll need those screams.
<br><br>
Sub RANT: <b>I don't want to have to download patches all day after I PAY for my CD and the monthly fee!</b>
<br><br>
Then stop playing on-line games that promise a virtual world.  If EQ shipped with absolutely no bugs, you would still be downloading patches.  This world will be changing.  The Dev Team will be there working on upgrades, new spells, new <em>stuff</em> and new features until... well, forever I hope.  Of course I'm willing to let them go back to regular eight-hour days.  Which brings me to the next rant.
<br><br>
RANT:  <b>Why should I have to pay a monthly fee?</b>
<br><br>
Sure, sure, you don't pay a fee to play Diablo.  You can play StarCraft for hours and not pay any fees.  But, well, that's Diablo and Starcraft.  When games like that arrive on the shelves, they are done (barring a bug patch or two).  The folks that made it are working on a sequel.  For EverQuest there is no sequel.  There's just more EverQuest.  New continents, new PLANES (I can't wait!), new classes (?), new spells, new...  new everything.
<br><br>
And there's bandwidth to buy.  Those 'free' gaming services are making their money with adds.  Verant won't.  As Brad said (easy to write an editorial if all you do is repeat what others say), EverQuest is not just a game, it's a service.  In fact, I would pay more than they are asking (cute price, guys...  $9.89...) for a premium service, one that had a few extra paid employees to run quests and such.
<br><br>
RANT: <b>Why do I have to lose my characters for release?</b>
<br><br>
Yup, there will be a character wipe (PLEASE stop saying player wipe...  that would really hurt the customer base) before release.  The logic behind it is simple.  It is not to punish the testers.  For those of you that went through phase 3 this will make perfect sense.  Restoring characters is a pain in the ass.  I think the community would be better served having GMs attend to the needs of the thousands of new players when the game is released than worrying about restoring characters for the privileged few.
<br><br>
And don't even try to use that
<br><br>
Sub RANT:  <b>But letting us keep our characters would lighten the load in the newbie areas!</b>
<br><br>
'cause that one's a load of crap.  Even if all current testers (what, 20,000?) were to keep their characters, there would still be 80,000 1st level characters.  The impact of removing what might amount to 1/5 of the population would be small.  And I a lot of us testers are going to start new characters at release to play with friends anyhow.
<br><br>
There is, of course, a counter rant.
<br><br>
RANT: <b>That's right!  Why should the testers get to keep their characters!</b>
<br><br>
Come on folks.  This is not a contest.  It's not a matter of favoritism.  And it doesn't hurt your character to start in a world with 1,450 1st level characters and 50 20th level characters.  If that's your concern, then anyone that starts playing the day the game comes out should not be allowed to level at all.  I mean that's just not fair for the guy in Nebraska whose pre-ordered CD got lost in the mail.  If HE has to join the game to find that you've got a 5th level monk, then he's not being treated fairly.  And let's not even talk about the guy that only hears about the game six months from now...
<br><br>
Zzzzzz....
<br><br>
Huh?  I'm awake mom, really I am!
<br><br>
Where was I?  Who cares.  Let me finish this and go to bed.
<br><br>
I know that EverQuest is not going to please everyone.
<br><br>
RANT:  <b>EQ sucks!  It's boring!</b>
<br><br>
Maybe.  I don't think so.  I know a large number of people that think it's just great.  But if you don't like it, I understand.  I hear that Civilization is a very popular game.  I don't like it.  That doesn't make me wrong.  But it doesn't make the folks that like Civilization wrong either.  Actually, I would be disappointed if EverQuest pleased everyone a little bit.  That would probably mean that it didn't please anyone a lot.  Hearing a few people scream about how boring it is for them actually makes me happy.  That means that those that like it won't be cheated by some scheme to make everyone happy.
<br><br>
Did I mention that I don't like Jordan's Wheel of Time series?  I don't.  I hate a book that takes a completely ignorant goof and turns him into a god.  Guys that are that ignorant DIE when they run into their first nasty monster...  Tolkien did it, and I allow him that.  The other million authors that do it are obviously trying to give me undue stress.  But if I hate that series with such a passion (there are HOW MANY in the series?  You're kidding?), then there are more folks that love it with the same passion.
<br><br>
And that's a good thing.
<br><br>
Enough.  I'm off to bed for...  ugh, about five hours sleep.   Good night all.
