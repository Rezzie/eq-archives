Fire beetles.  Snakes.  Shadow wolves bounding from behind one tree to behind the next.
<br><br>
There's a pattern to their seemingly endless meandering.  To one who does not stand back and see the whole picture it would all appear to be random and senseless.  Chaos, I believe is the term that the prophets put on it.  But they're so concerned with looking beyond the mundane to capture some glimpse of the future and what it holds that they'll never know what I know.  And all I had to do was leave it all behind and view it from a distance to understand.
<br><br>
That is why I have picked up a pen once again and begun to set my thoughts down on these pages.  To most it would seem from my last writing that these chronicles were at an end.  Funny that my detailing of the beginnings of the F'leurs DuMal would be kept and studied by their new recruits, as I'm not a writer and had previously performed no more feats of expression beyond attempts to belch "Innoruuk's Prayer of Contrition" after finishing off a case of brandy one fine day during services.  But there is an awful machinery that moves this world.  It grinds its inhabitants in its gears.
<br><br>
This is a tale of transformation.  Let us hope it works its spell on you.
<br><br>
I might have been happy to hang up my pen if it were not for the persistence of a fever I recently undertook.  Snowvayn has done her best to keep my brow cooled with damp cloth, but there is something unnatural at work here.  She has instructed me to lay still and make no exertion, but I have managed to procure my paper and quill and I'm going to spill whatever thoughts I have all over this page.
<br><br>
She has stepped out to gather more wood for the fire.  She has the dual task of keeping me cool while keeping Annarin, our son, warm.  I can hear the child fussing about in the small pen nearby the fireplace.  The toddler seems infinitely fascinated with the mobile I made of halfling bones, which dangles above his crib, twirling in gentle circles.  I think there is something special there in his eyes.
<br><br>
I have never been much of a family man.  This much is well documented.  Each of my relatives has fallen prey to some fateful act of destruction, often while I was within eye or earshot.  Strange coincidence or not, I'll not say.  But what I find strangely interesting about my current situation is that while we are a family, we are not the sort of family I remember experiencing as a child.
<br><br>
When we first arrived here in the cold north, it was merely out of necessity.  Snowvayn's father, a guard of some renown in Neriak, had gotten word of his grandchild's birth and in an ultimate gesture of spite, hired a man to come looking for me.  I did my best to make him believe we were going to Qeynos by making myself seen by the guards at the outpost in Qeynos hills.  But when he showed signs of remaining in the area, we went to Blackburrow and beyond there, to the snows of Everfrost.  Now we've been holed up for a week in the frigid climes, first using body heat, liquor and friction to keep warm, but when I took ill we had to switch to conventional methods like fire, lest she take ill as well.
<br><br>
Snowvayn was the first I saw change.  When we first met she was a seething cauldron of sexual frustration.  And for the past ten months we have been all over one another as she experiments to find a state of bliss.  I know the curiosity she feels; One might describe my entire life to this point as being a similar venture.  But when Annarin was born, she took to mothering very well, though not in traditional Tier'dal methods.
<br><br>
When I was a child, if I were to cry for whatever reason, be it hunger or a change of diaper, my parents followed the traditional method of letting me cry until I could cry no longer.  Suffering builds character was the passed on belief.  Snowvayn instead satisfies the child's need and then goes on about her business.  I dare say it's a very "human" method of parenting from what I've been led to believe.  I was of two minds as to how to react to this.  My heritage says that we are doing the child an injustice by not treating it more inhumanely.  But the side of me that has always won, the apathetic side, told me to let it go.
<br><br>
Essentially, we are all doomed to suffering and pain, so what matter the vehicle by which we arrive?  Gainam surely would not approve.  He would insist the child be baptized, held down a vat of blood and then circumcised with the ceremonial fang of the giant snake.  And if the infection did not kill him then he would be allowed to continue on in Tier'dal society.
<br><br>
I wonder of late if this is not why our people are still wallowing in the darkness underground; Because pain is not in the expression of our superiority, it is instead wasted in pointless ritual.
<br><br>
Seated here, watching Annarin fuss with the halfling bones, I could dote on my son all day.  That's not to say I'm an easy father, but the truth is that he fascinates me.  After so many destructive years I've been a party to the creation of something.  It makes me uneasy and I often feel unbalanced by the contrary feeling to those I've lived with for so long, but I suppose that is part of pain as well.
<br><br>
So let me be blunt and say that for once in my life, there is someone who I would do anything for.  And sitting here wrapped up in linen, a fire burning, Annarin gumming the end of a femur, a cold wind outside battering the walls of the cottage, and Snowvayn not far from returning, I begin to understand these latest feelings.  'Tis something I'd only felt a couple other times in my life and which had been missing ever since the founders of the F'leurs DuMal began to drift apart.  It is belonging.  And it seems to be as addictive as anything I'd ever drank.
<br><br>
I now sit up and lean back against the headboard, drinking in the peace.  I realize that moments like this are against everything Innoruuk stands for, but I also know that every single moment of pleasure in life is purchased by an equal moment of pain.  Meaning that without pleasure one would have no appreciation of pain.  If this be the one, then the other was not far around the corner.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
Shortly after I wrote that last sentence, Snowvayn came back.  She'd caught and exterminated a polar bear.  We were the beneficiaries, dining on bear meat and once the skins dried we would be dressed warmly.
<br><br>
"I didn't know you had it in you," I said with no intent to insult.  Fortunately she did not take it as an insult.  Her combat skills being that of a fledgling.
<br><br>
"It was weak.  Perhaps it had long been without food."
<br><br>
So they ate the bear and Annarin fell asleep first.  I lay on my back while Snowvayn fed me broth she'd made from what other food we had left over.  Bear would not do well nor stay in me for very long.  I don't recall much of our conversation, but I do remember her falling asleep there with the bowl in one hand and the spoon in the other.  She had one of those faces that sculptors used to measure their skill; If their work were half as breathtaking then they knew they had learned something.
<br><br>
The candle went out, but the fire still had logs and I let her sleep off her exhaustion.  But I could not sleep.  My fever was reaching its peak and I began to swim in my sheets.  The high winds outside pelted the window with chunks of ice, drumming such a regular sound that it would not awaken either mother or child.
<br><br>
The shadows moved and the fire crackled.  The elements were all here, I mused.  They were all here in this room.  I was told a story once when I was a child…
<br><br>
Maalik and A'gradin were brother and sister.  They were forbidden to enter their father's study, and they obeyed this as long as their curiosity would let them, but the lure of forbidden knowledge drew them to the room at the end of the long hall in their home.  They had been told of dangerous elements within.  While their parents slept, the two entered and dug through their father's goods.  Maalik discovered a book and began to read from it.  His limited knowledge of Old Erudin kept him from fully understanding the words.  The room erupted into flame and his sister A'gradin did as well, screaming and running across the room.  His sister was doomed, and fearing the wrath of his parents, Maalik ran outside the house and watched the place burn to the ground.  Parents, sister, and all.
<br><br>
It was meant to be a tale to inspire a fear of curiosity in me.  Of course our home burned down a few days after hearing this tale.
<br><br>
Irony can be amusing in moderation.
<br><br>
In my current diseased and bewildered state, I felt a strange synchronicity in the elements in the room.  The fire burned, its rage claiming the log as a victim.  The shadows danced a gleeful jig across the walls and ceiling.  We breathed, we exhaled.  The "dangerous" elements from the tale of Maalik were not stored in that room, they were brought in with the two children… They were life, curiosity, and desire.
<br><br>
These dangerous elements were the stuff of the most destructive moments.
<br><br>
I looked around for the elements.  We were the life, the three of us.  The curiosity could easily be mine as I sat there peering into the darkness, all that lacked was desire.
<br><br>
The spoon hit the floor.  Poor dear, she was so exhausted.  I made an effort to sit up, but this was no longer an option.
<br><br>
I would have been a long night without food, I thought.  How lucky we were.  That was when the elements began to make sense.  I must have realized it, as when I awoke, I was on the floor beside the crib, having done my level best to crawl to my son before my fever got the best of me.
<br><br>
I think it was the cold winds from the open door that brought me back to consciousness.  Snowvayn was there on her knees, putting her finger down her throat, leaning out into the snow.
<br><br>
I saw my son and he was pale; Far paler than any living Tier'dal can achieve.  The bear she'd slain had been ill, perhaps poisoned.  It showed no outward signs of rabies, so we felt it was one of the fine alchemical brews one can purchase for a handful of platinum in the shadiest corners of Neriak.  Seems our stalker had made his effort to kill us.
<br><br>
So this was pain?
<br><br>
I wept, holding my cold son in my hands.  I'd felt empty before, but never like this.  It was a warm moment for Innoruuk; The kind of triumph that the lord of pain can look back upon with fondness and glee.  He'd given me something to bring me from my drunken stupor because he knew that when he took it away I would not be numbed by drink.  I'd feel this pain all the way down to my soul.
<br><br>
Brilliant, really.  But then that's why he is master of what he does.
<br><br>
I felt Snowvayn's hand on my shoulder.  But my head was too busy considering the elements.  Life… my son's life.  Curiosity… that of the huntress combing the snow banks for food, for wood.  Desire for the survival of her family.
<br><br>
All things could be reduced to this triad of variables.
<br><br>
<em>So what</em>, you say?  Because I've put labels on observations which you may have made yourself, how does this give me clarity that you do not have?  You see, one need only look at the elements to predict motivation.  Motivations are so important.  Know your opponents three elements and you know what he'll do.  If you get one wrong, you can be easily defeated.
<br><br>
If you do not foresee the next destination to which I was destined to visit, allow me to re-introduce myself to you.  Hello, I'm Ezmend the drunkard.  Lord of the taverns.  Patron saint of poached livers.  The man and marinade in one.
<br><br>
But this was not my typical binge.  This eve it was my responsibility to drink, not just as a retreat but to create a show.  My son's killer would be close.  He would be in the bar or he would send a confederate in to look for me.  They would expect me to be dead from ingesting the bear, but in finding that I had survived, they would expect me to sit at the nearest bar and commiserate over the death of my young child.
<br><br>
So I sat within the stench of sweat and fish that infests all bars in Halas.  The barbarians got a good chuckle when the drunken Tier'dal fool was led away by his wife after a long binge.
<br><br>
The alcohol tasted different to me.  Not because it was cheap, barbarian brew, but because I did not want it.  I didn't want my anger numbed, I wanted to rage.
<br><br>
She showed me back to our home and the next morning, when I awoke with that old familiar ale brown fog clouding my head, my things had already been packed and set at the door.
<br><br>
"Either way," I said to Snowvayn, "There won't be any way you can go home again."
<br><br>
"I know," she said.  She pressed the bearskins into my hand and I gripped them tightly.
<br><br>
He would be pleased with himself, there in his high guard tower, listening to reports of how I'd lost my child and gotten drunk to forget.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
The next few days were the stuff of local legend.  Neriak had not been privy to such wild tales and gossip since I'd taken my darling Snowvayn and left the city under a bit of a cloud of scandal.
<br><br>
This furor was over some odd sightings.  It is spoken among the street urchins who lurk in the shadows that a great white bear stalked the streets; A bear white on the outside but black at it's center.  It loped like a man, upright through the streets.  It was a bit of my nearly vacated enchanter's art that allowed me to vanish down a long hallway and leave them wondering if they'd really seen anything at all.
<br><br>
And it was said that one of the indigo brotherhood, a truly cruel member of the guard, was mauled in his sleep.  Some surmised that a powerful magic user with a bear companion could have done this.  Or that perhaps the tale the children tell of a pale, upright bear might have some merit.  Or stranger yet, the bit of absurdity that the guard was enamored of trolls with long nails and that he met his end during a brutal sexual encounter.  That last was my favorite; I told that one while in disguise at the Blind Fish.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
I sat at services, listening to Gainam intone the virtues of looking into the eyes of a victim, be it serpent or high elf.  <em>Let them know</em>, he said, <em>why they have been defeated.  Let them know that Innoruuk sends his regards</em>.
<br><br>
He paused and I might have seen a smile on his face, were it possible for him to smile, as he passed the collection plate to me.
<br><br>
I went into the shadows room and sat awaiting a confessioner.  Gainam entered shortly thereafter.
<br><br>
"Shall I wear the hood?  Perhaps you'd like to wear it instead.  I bet it's your size," he said.
<br><br>
"That hood has seen enough action," I smirked, "let's just let it rest."
<br><br>
Gainam said an act of ascension for my son.  He seemed genuinely saddened that another Tier'dal had been snuffed out so early.  But as always he was a bit clinical, and saw the revelation of the virtue of pain that came with his passing.  He saw, as I did, how the hatred had come back to me through this act of treachery.  I suspect he was so clinical because he was so removed from the average activities of life.
<br><br>
In that short visit I gained a bit of insight into the pointless rituals that the priests performed.  I think that they rarely feel pain.  That is, they deny themselves many pleasures in life and therefore it becomes harder for them to fully recognize the true depths of pain.  The average Tier'dal starts at the heights of pleasure, and this gives him the full spectrum of pain as he descends.   With priests, they start neutral and work down.  Swallowing nails was not just a tribute to our lord of pain, (as was passing them the next day), I surmise it was an attempt to bring the priest from that level plateau that is their every day life to the same extreme of the average person. 
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
I left a handful of barbarian minted coins and my phony mustache in the collection tray as tribute before I left the temple.
<br><br>
I took a souvenir as well.  I stuffed the confessioner's mask into my bag and exited the building.  A little something for the misses, really.
<br><br>
Nektulos was full of young people in robes bashing any kind of animal they could harm, unaware of the three elements involved in victory.  I recall being so unenlightened once.
<br><br>
On the far reaches of Nektulos, across the river, I found a youth struggling to escape two skeletons.  He was woefully equipped for the combat and now was nearly crawling from them, hoping that the relentless dead would leave him be, by some miracle.
<br><br>
I nearly kept walking.  But survival of the fittest again was the sentiment of those who don't understand why our race is subjugated.  I stuck one skeleton to the ground, and the other I disabled with a few blows.
<br><br>
"Thank you," the youth said, "I thought they had me."
<br><br>
"Make no mistake:  They had you."
<br><br>
He shrugged.
<br><br>
"That's no answer," I said, "A shrug is a fool's means of response.  Let me tell you a story, about a brother and sister… Maalik and A'gradin…"
