Dear Editor,
<br><br>
I am writing this letter in response to Ian Ash's Mage Combat editorial.  While it
was an excellent editorial on Mage combat I do disagree with Ian on several points.
While Wizards will be able to do the most amount of damage in the least amount of
time I do not think they will be the masters of the Arena.  Enchanters, Necromancers,
and Magicians have the potential to just as powerful if not more so.

1.  Enchanters:  Enchantment is not a direct form of attack.  While the Wizard hurls
fire at his opposition the Enchanter does one of two things.  He either enchants his
party or the enemy's.  This has the potential to be extremely powerful.  For
example:  Bob the mighty Wizard and his party of 5 warriors come upon another group.
Bob immediately begins hurling fireballs and lighting bolts at the other party.  When
the smoke clears the party is still there but now advancing on his.  Remember that
there will be armor out there that will be resistant or immune to certain elements,
this was brought up on either a message board or in one of the chats.  Bob still
isn't worried because his five warriors are there to back him up, little does Bob
know that the friendly neighborhood enchanter has either a) cursed his warriors, or
something similar, so they do little damage or b) enhanced his own warriors attacks.
This is how the enchanter would fight, as well as bringing into the fray enchanted
beings to aid his group, as in the example of the Dragon.

2.  Necromancers:  Necromancers will most likely have the life draining spells that
are seen in so many of the pencil and paper role playing games out there.  They will
also be able to create or control undead.  This makes them dangerous for not only can
they deal damage to a single target they can create a horde of undead to swarm the
target.  Bob the wizard would have 2 choices: do I a) attack the necromancer and get
swarmed by his undead or do I b)attack the undead and get dropped by the
necromancer.  The necromancer then would easily be as powerful as a Wizard if he was
well adapted to the tactics it would take to be a necromancer.
