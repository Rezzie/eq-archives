<em>"Killed by Dwarves and chased by Gnomes in this fair land that I call home.
<br><br>
Sadly they see no wrong in this as they break my teeth with their angry 
fists.
<br><br>
I run and dodge to no avail, to have my head smashed open with iron flails.
<br><br>
If only they could see across the blue. They'd find a Teir'Dal army... but 
they have no clue.
<br><br>
Its time for me to go, away I fly. Knowing that one day, they'll all die."</em>
<br><br>
This song got me no sympathy (didnt expect it to) only more disdain as the 
foul dwarves ang gnomes of butcherblock put prices on my head. I laughed and 
headed to Kelethin, my home. I rested in one of the tree hammocks, knowing 
it would be my last time here in a while. Tomorrow, I'll say goodbye to 
Faydwer.
