<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm a 6th level human ranger and a bunch of my wood elf buddies convince me to visit Greater Faydark.  The scenery is beautiful, the natives are friendly, and the school system is par exellence, however I have a problem.  I can handle not being able to see half the time even with light; it's embarassing to be a ranger and get lost at night, but I'm getting confidence therapy and I think I can beat it.  I understand the high prices I'm charged; I realize that designer merchandise demands a larger fee.  What drives me buggo is no armor in my bloody size!  I can't afford the Calvin Klien patchwork armor they try to sell me in Felwithe, the stupid Orcs keep dropping small tunics or large belts (making me wonder how they ever manage to get a tuxedo fitted) , and the tailoring guide tells me to use catskin.  Great!  Where are the cats?  In some level 30 area in Steamfront?  Please help.  It's hard to be a tank without armor and my friends are gaining levels faster than I can take damage.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Okies, it sounds like those very aloof elves are missing a bet in fashion merchandising by not stocking medium sizes.  However, all is not lost and with a little buying trip across the sea, you should be wearing suitable ranger attire soon.  First, it is important to remember that if you insist on tanking, even the greatest armor in the world will not keep you from dying relatively often.  Why, my Pillar of Wisdom, Sylvos, is now a highly skilled ranger with glorious duds but since he fancies himself as a tank, he still dies all the time.   If you really want to level fast then, the very best armor you might seek is a huge barbarian warrior to take most of the damage while you raise those very considerable ranger offensive skills.  That said, of course you need armor and there are two types you might consider at your level.  If you and your friends can gather about 100 plat, you should be able to engage the monsters while clad in a full suit of banded armor and be glad of it.  If poverty is still with you (as it often is with bards, regardless of level), then tailoring is the way to go.  I'd suggest you get a ride of some sort over to West Karana and seek a cat party.  With a few cat pelts and your sewing kit, you should be wearing patched armor, medium sized, quite soon.  Leather armor is also an option, but the merchants charge a fortune for it and you gotta watch the seams.  They skimp so badly sometimes on the sewing that with a tap from the tip of a decayed skeleton's sword, the entire armor falls off you leaving you quite ummm breezy.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can't I hear music in Alone in the Dark 3?  The game seems to support musical score (the sfx are ok) but it can't recognize any fm card.  Well are the guys from Infogrames so stupid?

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk about wild goose chases!  Why I went from tavern to tavern, seeking out lightless  rooms and found that I could play my songs just fine and quite loudly when I was alone in the dark.  However, I prefer company, so soon decided to ask around about your question.  Turns out, sadly, that apparently you warped into the wrong game's Question and Answer column.  This column addresses questions about Everquest and I'm sorry, but I don't have a clue as to the answer to your question.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, I will just start by saying great newspaper. But I was wondering, what is the deal with charged items. How do you use one, and what happens when you use all charges? I am a magician, and I can summon a Staff of Tracing which has 2 charges of flare. I wanted to use the charge, so I kept clicking repeatedly on it when it was equipped. I eventually used it (I saw myself cast it) and it said I only had 1charge left. I repeated the same thing. When I cast the effect again, it still said the staff had 1 charge left! I did it over and over, and it kept casting the effect. When I died, I gave that staff to my new pet, and summoned a new one. I tried the same process again. This time, I ran out of charges, and it said it had 'effect:flare' with no charges. And when I equipped it, it gave me a fairly strong light source. Can you explain any of this to me? When it says "effect" of something, that means it will usually go off during battle (My warrior has a PGT, 'effect:berzerker strength'). Does that mean after I use all charges, I can still use the effect? Please, if you can help me, any information would be appreciated. Thank you for your time.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll have to hope I understood what the Pillar of Wisdom, Tagad, was explaining to me and that I am relaying it correctly.  Basically, items in Everquest can contain effects with  charges and procs or combinations of the same.  An item may have an effect that you click on with a limited number of charges; an effect that you click on with an unlimited number of uses; an always-on effect usually seen upon wearing or wielding the item (some will even have an effect in inventory like lightstones); and an effect that procs (like the PGT "berzerker strength").   If your item has charges, it may -- in some instances be rechargeable -- the charges left on the item will show just below the effect description.  If the item has more than one effect, it is possible to have the charges run out on one part of it and still gain the benefit of the remaining unlimited effect.  Procs are essentially unlimited charges that you don't click on that do occur under certain circumstances, usually battle.  I am not sure what to say about the variable effects you got from the two different Staffs of Tracing.  Perhaps they are meant that way or perhaps there is some bug at work.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question, but a response to a post in Issue 111.   A Paladin *can* complete the quests for faction with the thieves' guild (I'm not at liberty to discuss why I'm improving faction with them by order of the Temple of Marr) as my half-elf Paladin has completed the missions many times. Now, wandering into the Necro/SK areas of the tunnels are definitely a different result &lt;g&gt; .

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My goodness, I would think a Paladin in the thieves' guild would cause a stir and considerable comment.   Thank you for writing and for the warning about the tunnels.  I know I do my best to avoid wandering in them too.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister bard, might I have a moment of your time?  I love to run across the countryside, easing my partners'  travels and seeing the world. However it seems that I have developed this strange affliction. I used to glide across the landscape, leaving beautiful sparkles and enlightening the mood of those who watched. Now I am embarrassed to pick up my drumsticks....whenever I begin to sing the song known as Selo's, I....well, I WADDLE!  I am in fear of falling on my face and breaking my drum! Have I been cursed? Hexed? Is there a treatment? I have wailed to the leaders of my guild home in Kelethin but to no avail...please help me!

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ack I just KNEW it.  Not only is Bristlebane tonedeaf, he is so envious of our bard arts and charms, he decided to have a little nasty fun at our expense.  I went out into the barrens of Lavastorm to see if I waddled too when playing my very expensive and useful drum.  Whew, I was glad the only creature to see me was the creepy crawler thingy that slithered by because its head wasn't high enough to see my amply waddling rear as we passed each other.  It's just plain time a new god or goddess appeared in Norrath who cared just for those called to barding and protected us against BB's little tricks.  Oh, and did I mention that if we had such a deity, not only would we not waddle, we could choose to walk gracefully in a beautiful dresses regardless of our race.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'ello lads an' lasses, this 'ere is fer Nanlayan Dai'Kana o' Tarew Marr.  Ye asked if ye could get yer weapon back from the pet by disarmin' it aye?  I'm fer bein' in me 37th season, me disarm skill is 'bout 130, an' I can tell ye it impossible to disarm necropets, not fer bein' sure 'bout mage pets though.  Aye, tis true, I spent near 10 minutes tryin t'disarm a level 4 or 5 or somethin' necro pet with a 2handed sword (easiest to disarm 2handers in me opinion), all fer naught.  Needless t'say, me disarm skill went from a hunnerd to a hunnerd an' thrity.    On a further note, PvP it'd prolly be possible, since yer all enemies.    May Brell watch over ye as 'e guides yer sword, yer shield, an yer arm,  an' may 'e protect ye from all 'arm.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Heavens above, with a name like yours, I would have assumed that the pets would shake in their boots and then simply drop their weapons at your feet when they found out you were trying to disarm them.  If you can't do it with those shoulders, I sure don't know who can.  Thanks for writing and you have my admiration for choosing such a marvelous name.  Oh, and a little note -- do you suppose you could get Brell working on a dress for me instead of guiding my sword and shield?  I think getting something pretty to wear is going to take divine intervention and the old rogue god I'm supposed to talk to doesn't have a clue about how important beautiful dresses are to a bard's success.  (Well, if the bard is female anyway!)   Not only that, but (see above), now the old rogue geezer is making bard's waddle when they playing their speed song.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Druids, shamans, necromancers, magicians and enchanters can all have pets." You forgot ShadowKnights. They can summon a skeleton pet =)
