<b>Part Five</b>


<br><br>


   The low hallway led into a tiny room.  A heavy wooden door was set deep into the stone wall, featureless save for a small panel.  Daryth rapped a complicated staccato and the panel slid open.  All that could be seen of the person on the other side was a pair of suspicious eyes.
<br><br>
   "Hail, Galern," said Daryth.  "Let us in."
<br><br>
   "Who's the bint?" Galern replied in a heavy Dwarvish accent.
<br><br>
   "She's with me," answered Daryth, and smiled dangerously at the other Rogue.  Muttering, Galern slid shut the panel.  Kinory could hear locks unbolting and a heavy scraping as a bar was pushed aside.  The door swung noiselessly open.
<br><br>
   Inside, the rough unadorned walls became polished wood panels and rich draperies.  Small figurines and other works of art stood in niches and hung along the walls.  The floor was covered with a lush, deep piled carpet.  Small ornate globes held glowing magic lights that beat against their prisons futilely.  Kinory blinked around at her surroundings.  Daryth elbowed her ungently and she closed her mouth sheepishly.
<br><br>
   "Country waif," muttered Galorn.  He was a stumpy Dwarf with a bristling red beard and piercing blue eyes.  He squinted savagely at her.  She returned his look coolly.  He harumphed loudly and poked her with a thick finger.  She jumped.
<br><br>
   "Elves are no damn good!" he pronounced.  "Too frail, always whining and moaning about the bee-oo-tiful forest they left behind...  Well, come along, don't be all day!"  He stumped off down the luxurious hallway, muttering to himself.   Daryth gave Kinory a shove, and she followed the Dwarf unwillingly.   She found herself yearning for the open air.  She was enclosed, and the walls seemed suddenly much too close together. Her skin felt too tight.
<br><br>
   "Daryth," she began.
<br><br>
   "I know, my dear.  Be easy.  It will get easier in time."   He seemed completely at ease.  She swallowed her protest and continued after the Dwarf.
<br><br>
   They passed by doors on either side, came to a fork in the hall and turned left.  The place was massive.  More than once, they passed side halls that seemed to stretch for miles. The wealth that was displayed casually was mindboggling.  Everything was rich and well-appointed. Kinory made a conscious effort not to stare. 
<br><br>
    They went through a set of huge double doors, and emerged into a high ceilinged room.  The floor was marble and the walls as well, and in the ceiling a series of skylights let in the midmorning sun.  At the far end was another set of double doors, and it was there that Galorn led them.  A gorgeous half-elven woman lounged on a settee on the left, paring her nails with a small dagger that caught the light like fire.  As they approached she rose gracefully to her feet.  The dagger disappeared somewhere into her inadequate clothing.
<br><br>
   "Daryth," she purred, and draped herself over the shorter man.  "<em>Where</em> have you been?"  She eyed Kinory in a not unfriendly manner.  "Down country again, I see.  Little young for your taste, isn't she?"
<br><br>
   "My new protegee," he said.  Kinory looked at him in surprise, and then quickly dropped her eyes to the floor to hide the huge smile that bloomed on her lips.  "Be nice to her, Katha.  She's young and green, but not entirely stupid."  
<br><br>
   "As you wish, of course," she said, smiling at Kinory.  He turned her face back to his and kissed her. Galern cleared his throat twice before they disengaged.   Kinory watched interestedly.  
<br><br>
   "Ah, Kat, I've missed you," sighed Daryth.  She laughed and stepped away.
<br><br>
   "Teron wants to see you," she said, and gestured at the doors.  
<br><br>
   "I figured as much.  Could you see Kinory settled?"  She nodded.  Daryth turned to Kinory, and lifted her chin with a finger.   "Be good now.  No wandering.  I'll come see you later."
<br><br>
   "Daryth!" she said as he turned away.  He glanced back at her.  "Thank you."  He grinned, and went through the door that Galern was holding open.
<br><br>
   "Well, well," said Katha, eyeing her up and down.   "Bit on the small side, aren't you?  Of course, that never stood in Daryth's way.  Come on, then.  I'll see you to the training quarters.  With Daryth's sponsorship, you'll not have to pass the Tests, but the training, everyone has to go through."  She put an arm around Kinory's slim shoulders, and steered her away from the doors.
<br><br>
   "Tests?" asked Kinory faintly.
<br><br>
   "My my, he didn't tell you anything, did he?  Just like him, that sneaky taciturn bastard."  Katha laughed.  She gave Kinory a friendly squeeze.  "Don't worry.  I'll let you in on all the little secrets and intrigues. There will be some who resent you, simply because you are Daryth's protegee.  He has enemies.  No surprise, really.  Second in command after only ten years.  I'm a little jealous myself, and I'm about the most unambitious person you'll ever run across."
<br><br>
   "He's the second in command?"  Kinory asked, startled.
<br><br>
   "He <em>did</em> tell you nothing.  Where did you meet him?  In Kelethin, no doubt.  On his little secretive jaunt to Clan Crushbone.  Playing the hero."  Katha shook her head.  "He'll get himself killed one of these times."
<br><br>
   "So that's what he was there for," mused Kinory.
<br><br>
   "Oh, he was a Ranger once, and never quite got over the whole 'good' thing.  Every so often, he takes off and spends a month or so fighting the good fight."  Katha wore a slightly rueful grin.  "I've never really understood it, but then I don't understand him, either, so..."  
<br><br>
   "I think I do," said Kinory.  She could see it in him, that sarcastic yet wistful wish that the world could be different.  Katha laughed aloud, and Kinory blushed.
<br><br>
   "So that's the way the wind blows, is it?"  She nudged the younger girl with an elbow.  "You have your work cut out for you, my dear.  He likes his women a bit more sophisticated."  
<br><br>
   "No, that's not what I meant at all, I just, I mean, I know that he's... complicated," stuttered Kinory, her cheeks red as fire.
<br><br>
   "Mmm hmm," said Katha and patted her shoulder.  "You'll get over it."  Kinory stared at the floor in abject humiliation.  She didn't think of him in that way, she didn't!  "Here we are."
<br><br>
   Katha pushed open another set of double doors, and led Kinory into a wide open courtyard.  The walls were studded with stones and wooden ledges, and tall ladders led to catwalks and tightropes high in the air.  Ten or so young trainees were swarming all over the constructions.  Kinory watched, mouth open in admiration and amazement, as a human boy climbed one wall like a fly, clinging to protrusions that she could barely see.
<br><br>
   Katha clapped her hands sharply, and they all dropped or climbed down to the ground.  They assembled in a loose group before the slender woman.
<br><br>
   "I'd like you all to say hello to Kinory.  Today, she joins Teron's Rogues."  They all examined her from head to toe, wearing expressions that ranged from dubious to outright contemptuous.  Kinory felt weighed, measured, and found wanting.  She straightened her back and set her teeth, anger welling up inside her.  How dare they judge her so quickly?  
<br><br>
   "I'll get her settled, and then she'll join the underclass, if that is all right with you, Pedder," said Katha as the crowd of young Rogues dispersed back to their training.  Kinory turned to see a stout Halfling eyeing her speculatively.
<br><br>
  "Aye, 'tis no problem whatsoever, my love.  Has she not taken the Tests, then?  I have not heard of any Testings to be done until the month end."  His voice was rich and surprisingly deep for his stature.
<br><br>
   "She is Daryth's new protegee," said Katha.
<br><br>
   "Indeed and is it so?" he said, his eyebrows rising.  "Well, that is a thing, now, is it not?"  He looked at her with new respect.  " All right, come along back when you've settled.  We'll see what we can make of you."
<br><br>
   The small room that Katha led her to was off the training grounds in a maze of narrow hallways.  It was surrounded by dozens of rooms exactly like it, and the window looked out over the tangle of back alleys the Guild was nestled in.  The bed was not wide, but not quite as small as the bunk on the ship.  A small chest sat in the corner, and the window had a ledge just wide enough for Kinory to sit on.  She set her pack on the chest and rested herself by the window.  
<br><br>
   "Don't be too long," said Katha.  "Pedder probably won't start you today, but he'll want to evaluate you, and he doesn't like to be kept waiting.  Can you find your way back down?"  Kinory nodded, and offered the Half-elf a tremulous smile.  Katha smiled back.  "I think you'll be fine."   
<br><br>
   Kinory stared out across the hazy cityscape, her heart and mind a whirl of unfamiliar thoughts and feelings.   At last she roused herself and found her way back down to the training area.
<br><br>
   Pedder waited for her in the center on a wooden bench.  The other students were gone, and the place seemed too quiet, somehow.  She opened her mouth to offer an apology, but he forestalled her with a raised hand.
<br><br>
   "This is, doubtless, the last time you will keep me or any other of your teachers waiting, is it not?  Then we will say no more on the subject."  She nodded.  He regarded her for a long minute.  "Well, then, lass, let us begin with climbing."
<br><br>
   Two hours later, Kinory was exhausted and trembling.  Pedder was uncompromising.  Every time she thought she had reached the end of her resources, he reached down and dragged another scrap of effort from her.  She ran endless laps, climbed the ladder maze over and over, and even scaled the easier wallpaths until her knees felt like water, and her panting breaths scraped her throat raw.  He finally let her rest.
<br><br>
   "Not entirely unsatisfactory," said the Halfling.  "We will begin you with the lower intermediate class.  Students who have been here for a few years, and are on the verge of being given outside assignments.  I am given to understand you have had Ranger training?"  She nodded, too breathless to even ask how he knew anything about her.  "Good then.  It should not take you much time to catch up in your sneak skills."  He gave her a wide smile.  "Welcome, lass.  You are a Rogue now!"
