A long long time ago, in a Realm far far away, err, well it was about a year and little more ago and the world was Norrath, I wrote a silly little poem called "Ode to Cleavage" and happened to read it to a crotchedty old wizard who then said, "Why don't you send this in to EQ Express."  "EQ what?"  was, of course, my response and thus I was introduced to the wonders of an online newspaper written by relatively normal, quite talented people who were fascinated by the imaginal life.  Since that delightful introduction to EQ Express, its editors and its contributors, not to mention the resultant publication of my first Everquest poem, I have delighted in the stories, poems, cartoons, artwork, thoughtful essays and the occasional burst of brilliant wit.
<br><br>
Every Saturday, I open up the front page of EQ Express and immediately jump to see if Absor has spelled my name right.  After that, it's on to my favorite feature, the <a href="../credits/archart.htm">Fit to Print Ads</a>, which always amuse me immensely.  Just last week with <a href="../Issue103/advert50.gif">Women are from Marr -- Men are from Veeshan</a>, I laughed so loud my family assumed that an alien had taken over my body and was emitting signals designed to be heard as far away as Cassiopeia.   It doesn't seem to matter whether it's an Oasis advertisement scattered with sand or an ice-framed one of beer from Halas, they all amuse and delight me.   Ok, so maybe my choice of favorite feature indicates that I'm a lightweight bard with a low score on the fantasy philosophy intelligence test!  But then again, a good bard never sits around and takes the world too seriously, so perhaps my favorite element of EQ Express elucidates my bardly taste admirably.
<br><br>
As for my own published writing, hmmm, now that is a discernment challenge since I've only actually written down about 2 percent of the ideas that came my way in the past year leaving me with little to choose from when I look at my list of articles and poems.  However, I do have a favorite publication, not because of it's literary value, but because the of the change it brought about in my life.  "<a href="../Issue45/cleavage.htm">Ode to Cleavage</a>" was written out of my amusement at the proportions allotted to females in Everquest.  I hoped it would entertain.  What I never expected was that this ditty would open doors for me to meet real writers.  It allowed me to meet people who take the time each week to set down their thoughts in words to share with others -- words that they choose with craft, seeking clarity and expression (except late Friday night when they're in a hurry!).   The ode also led to the experience and joy of letters from people who read what I wrote and even enjoyed it enough to say so.   That fluffy little poem brought me into the world of EQ Express where I was welcomed and given an opportunity to write essays, poems and, finally, the Q&A Column that I enjoy so much.  As perhaps a dwarf friend would say, "T'was a marv'l i'deed!"
<br><br>
I look forward to going back from time to time, like I did in preparation for this essay, to the writings and art of EQ Express and reveling in the ideas and wit that they offer.  Everquest will continue to change and so will EQ Express, but the essential pleasure I have experienced from these two years of contributions will not fade.   Even as I have taken the time to choose my favorites from the past, I anticipate delightful explorations of the yet-to-come issues of EQ Express and look forward to the very next issue.
