It seems that everyday we hear a new twist on what's going on with EverQuest.  When a bit of information gets offered, whether as a response to a post or an official information release, someone comes up with a twist on it which has "grave" implications for the future of EQ and their concerns must be addressed right now, by Brad himself.  To aid in the creation of rumors and misinformation, here is a blueprint on how to create a "grave", "serious" or "game-threatening" implication to a published bit of fact.
<br><br>
First of all, ignore any experience you may have had with any MUD.  Since the idea of EverQuest seems to be based on the programmers experience with MUDs, and is an online environment much like a MUD, any fact that comes out about how the game is played is likely to have been framed in the context of a MUD.  If you have no experience with MUDs, or have only played one MUD and think that is the only way a MUD can work, perfect.  You are not likely to let ignorance get in the way of your opinion.
<br><br>
Second of all, your experience with Quake or any shoot-em up is paramount.  The more you have the better.  A shoot em up game is so exactly like the EverQuest game, that you should be able to extrapolate into it with confidence.  Never mind that it is not a fantasy setting, or that there is a pvp switch.  The two games are exactly alike.  Ignore the game setting history also.  Norrath is just one big map.
<br><br>
Third, the less you know about programming, the better.  Except if you know just a little bit, and believe that it applies to every game out there and EverQuest specifically.  In this case, your opinion is definitely needed, and you should not hesitate to voice it.
<br><br>
Fourth, do not bother to think it out.  In fact, applying logic to your opinion will quickly shoot it down, since logical thinking usually resolves the issue within a few minutes.  Knee-jerk reaction is what we are looking for.  Even better, (only the true geniuses can do this) think logically from a false premise. 
<br><br>
Fifth, and the MOST important… Ignore the FAQ .  It is a phony document that 989 puts out to entrap the unwary.  All the chats that Brad has done, he does because he just likes having 200 questions thrown at him in a span of 20 minutes.  His time is your time, since you are the paying customer!
<br><br>
Also, forget about any chat or responses to posts you have read from Brad.  They are not officially on the FAQ, so they don't count.  Oh, and don't let it bother you that this paragraph and the last contradict each other.  Contradictions should be ignored.
<br><br>
Last of all, be sure that you touch on PvP.  No one has written on PvP yet, so it's a fresh topic.  Not only that, but if someone has, your opinion is better, since you are you and they are some dweeb with a Net connection.
<br><br>
Let's do a little exercise. For example, let's say that you saw a screen shot, and noticed that some text was highlighted yellow.  Though you have nothing at all to base this conclusion on, conclude that it means… oh, say that it means that in-party text during combat is highlighted yellow.  Then extrapolate that to mean that non-party text is not highlighted, and therefore almost illegible.  Illegible! Brad, how could you discriminate against people who prefer to play alone? (Never mind the previous statements that Brad has made in chats and post responses about how EQ is party-based)  And won't this affect PvP?
<br><br>
Now, once you have your opinion set, here is how to make sure it gets out to the EverQuest Community:
<br><br>
<ol>
	<li>Mail every news site. Be sure not to do a mass mailing, but target each site with a separate e-mail.  On a slow news day, some site will likely pick it up, and if that happens, the others may rush to cover it also.  Opinions are sometimes posted as news.
	<li>Post on the news boards.  Be sure to put "Question for Brad Important, Answer Please!" in the subject line.  Even better is "Brad, you need to answer this."  The more demanding you make your tone of voice, the more important your opinion is.  Really.  I've seen it happen.  Change your name from site to site if you want.  People never track that stuff anyway, so if you want it to appear that a whole bunch of people are concerned with the same thing you are, this is the way to go.  IP tracking is for nerds.  If you get responses to your post flaming you, flame back.  Intelligent debate like this is what message boards work to achieve.  Post as often as the board will let you. Be especially certain to misspell words and insult other posters.  You are the MAN, and these geeks who don't know anything.  Use CAPS often for EMPHASIS.
	<li>Get on #everquest.  Here is where you can really create chaos.  Refer to your post on a news site (only if you have done it under another name) as if it were fact.  Ask people's opinions.  Get the whole channel into an uproar by claiming that you know a 989 employee who is  "pissed off", and that is your source.  If you do this right, the people in #everquest who hang in #norrath or other channels will pass this back and forth.
</ol>  
	If this is still too difficult for you, I have created a handy form as a beginning post.  Just fill in the blanks, and you should be ready to go!

	Thread:  BRAD, IMPORTANT PLEASE ANSWER NOW PVP QUESTION<br>
	989 has neglected to address the importent issue of [insert misspelled phrase here]  I have played [insert shootem up game] for [insert time period less than a month], and I see Everquest is making a BIG mistake by [insert reason], because it affects PvP unfairly by making it hard to murder other players indiscrm indescrim, indisrcimotely  well, A LOT. This is why the MAJORITY of your audience want to play, and you will seriously PISS them OFF, as you have me. In my programming experience, you can't send a PvP packet through a network without having it affect a non-PvP packet, so why bother!  If this is not addressed, [insert the appropriate doom]. I here that your start date has been pushed back, so there is NO REASON why this can't be fixed before publication. Oh, and can I be a troll wizard? I here that they would ROCK.
