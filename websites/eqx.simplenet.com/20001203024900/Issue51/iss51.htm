"Utter gibberish!" cursed the wizard as he glared at the text open before him.  Ozymandius stood and pushed his chair back, careful not to dislodge the young bard sitting next to him.  Then he turned and paced the room, hands clasped behind his back, brow furrowed in irritation.
<br><br>
"What did you expect?  You get the book and all his plans would be laid out before you?"  Nepenthia wiggled a bit in her chair, scooting it closer to the table and gazing intently down at the book, The Scriptures of Innoruuk, that lay open on the desk<b>...</b>

<br><br>
	We set out for the Beholder Maze for the oldest of motives - greed.  We had heard from passing travelers about the axes that were wielded by the minotaurs found deep within the labyrinthine valleys.  These axes, for those of us proficient in the use of slashing, were a wonder to behold.  Larger and yet lighter than the typical battle axe, they allowed the wielder to do more damage and attack more quickly<b>...</b>

<center><big><b>From E3 To Today</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
Many of you will recall that in Issues 24 and 25, I offered a detailed
report of EverQuest as I saw it at E3.  Due to the gracious release of
the NDA for our humble paper, I can give you the run down of what has
and has not changed between now and then.
<br><br>
Let me start off the same way I did in <a href="../Issue24/e3.htm">EverQuest E3 Report - part 1.</a>
The beta is in full swing now, well into Phase 3.  Secondly, yes, the
game <b>still</b> lives up to the hype.  Now that you feel a little
better, let's move on to the details.

<center><big><b>Mechanical Role-Playing</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
Now we have charts of statistics, hints of spoilers, lists of lists and all sorts of other mechanical data, some players wonder where we stand on role-playing. I can attest to the fact that role-playing is contagious, and the environment for role-playing is being built. We start to see more of the vast background for Norrath during our daily quests and journeys to new places, and even just the world itself has some classic role-playing value.

Things are going well, except for having to run for my life to get away from a pair of goblins.  One is a challenge, two is suicide at this point.  So I look around and find my next target.  Somewhere on the horizon is a skeleton (SLANG: a skel).  I can handle him.  I'm full of mana.  According to all signs I can get him.

<center><big><b>A Woman's Point of View</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
	A professor of mine once told me that men have their thoughts concentrated in a narrow cone of view, while woman have their thoughts concentrated within a bubble around their head. Meaning that men concentrate on one thing, very intently, while women have many things circling around. Basically, women multitask better than men. 
<br><br>
	This could not have applied better to the previous article <a href="../Issue47/women.htm">Women Vs. Internet gaming</a>. Men with their intense concentration on games, (such as quake II) or on sports, as most women know, give bad examples to women for the love of that sport or game. Of course if we are watching you play quake so intensely that you drown out everything around you and become furious when you get killed because your teammate does not cover your ass, we laugh. Quake is not the game to introduce any female to Internet gaming.

And it seemed that muck would be the with us the whole trip.  Our second day out of Qeynos we encountered a storm.  Not a hard, driving storm, but a solid and steady one that lasted the entire day and on into the night.  When we arrived at the DeadFall Inn that second evening of our journey we were covered with water and the mud tossed up by our horses.  This is the one thing that you never hear in tales, the miserable conditions that exist on the road.  Certainly the heroes of legend, Idar, Finn, Rebal, all had to travel in the rain<b>...</b>

This is going to be a tough subject for some of us for a while, but it's something that I want to talk about.
<br><br>
First, I want to thank Severian for sending in a <a href="letters.htm">letter</a> that expresses exactly the sentiments that are driving me on this issue.  Please read it before you continue on with this editorial...

I had the good fortune to have been able to read Absor's <a href="edita.htm">editorial</a> before it was published.  If you haven't read it, read it now, it's excellent. I would like to follow it up with an open letter to the EQ future players and present beta testing community.
