My blood runs cold when I think of them.
<br><br>
I've spent decades here… not months or years.  I've dwelt in this place when I could have been out enjoying myself.  For forty-one years I've hired followers, built shrines, loaded tombs with powerful corpses.  I've taken every care that I could ever imagine and put it into the placement of my enchantments and the positioning of my traps.  I've lured the most magnificent and malicious beasts in the known world and a few that are not from this world into my abode and given them places of prominence and placated them with food or treasure.  And it seemed a labor of love.

Recently something exciting has happened on my server Karana.  In fact I wish I had thought of it.  A person from the server called a meeting of guild leaders to discuss the atmosphere of the server.  
<br><br>
That about sums up the general intent.  Basically the guild leaders who attended, or those like myself who had to go chase down a tart blond greyhound who got out of the fence and had someone log it to read it later, got together with no other interest but to bring more entertainment to the server.

	Smoke swirled around my head, and the acrid stench of sulfur filled my nostrils. I looked around to see that I was in a rough-hewn maze of caverns sprawling under the earth. The heat was stifling, and sweat poured down my brow. I heard shouts and footsteps echoing in every direction, and Darnack emerged from the passage ahead. He spoke, but his words were garbled and unintelligible. As he stood there, I noticed that the lustrous bronze of his armor seemed somehow tainted. I glanced at his hands to see that they were discolored<b>...</b>

I can't do it!
<br><br>
There are NOT enough hours in the day!
<br><br>
Part of it is my fault, I know.  I tend to do things the slow and established way.  Take EQX for example.  I'm quite certain that some innovative young whippersnapper could get it all edited and ready for the web in half the time it takes me.

I took this week completely away from EverQuest.  I ran across Razor (a former EQX staffer) in ICQ after not having talked with him for a while, and he has been building a MUD.  For those of you who don't know what a MUD is, well, EverQuest is a MUD, although a much much spiffier and more complex one.

I just thought I'd let you know that there's another game that's similar to that, but due out much sooner.
 <br><br>
You may or may not have heard of the game Vampire: The Masquerade. It's a pencil & paper game that's grown fairly popular. Recently, a company called Nihilistic Software decided to convert that game onto the computer.
