Your character makes mistakes, and is not perfect.  This is especially true for characters who are just starting to adventure.  Be sure that your character is not the master of everything, and that his/her knowledge reflects his/her life up to that point.
<br><br>
Read.  Read.  Read.  The more you read, the better your writing will get.  I especially look at how dialogue is written, since I can never keep track of the rules for it.

<b>Proof-reading</b>
<br><br>
This article has been proof-read two times by three different people.  What I thought was clear when I wrote it was not clear when I read it, and so I had to change several sentences, and even restructure a whole paragraph.  You never know how you sound to others, so it is best to get someone else to read what you write.  Be careful with this, however!  Not all people are good proof-readers, and criticism which is not constructive can be pretty disheartening.  Heck, even constructive criticism is disheartening at times.  Most people can tell when something doesn’t make sense, but can’t tell you why.  Ask your proof reader to first read it through for readability, spelling, and grammar, then to read it a second time for the quality of the tale.

I hope these tips are useful for you as you begin your character biographies or journals.  Writing has rules, and good writing follows them.  (Grammar rules should be broken only when you understand exactly why you are breaking them.) While reading EverQuest web sites I have been struck by the high quality of ideas that are sometimes poorly communicated. There are a lot of excellent writers out there that need a proof-reader!
<br><br>
I am not a literary expert, nor a very experienced writer, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt.  You are still the best judge of your work, because it is you, yourself that decide how much effort you want to put into it.  Go to  guild pages and read their histories and their members’ biographies.  Question why a biography is good or bad.  Does it get your attention, but confuse you?  Is it clear, yet dull?  The better you can answer these questions, the better your writing will be!
