Never before has one of my articles generated so much response and interest.
I thank those of you who have sent me praises and thanks, as it is good
to know that some people appreciate the time I take to sit down and write.  
This has prompted me to write a part two, so that I can relate some more 
EverQuest information and clear up a few issues.

First of all, the chart showing races and classes has generated the most
feedback.  It has ranged from "Wow!" to "EverQuest sucks!"  Either way, I
must point out an important fact.  I am only human, and the chart was a
result of me sitting down at the demo booth and writing little Xs on a 
piece of paper.  There was bound to be an error or two, such as a missing
X or a misplaced X.  However, it does give you a good guideline for what
is available and how things are structured.  It is very close to correct.
But, and I want to emphasize this...

<br><br>
There is one other point I must make before moving on.  EverQuest is not
even into beta yet.  This means they are still working on developing the
basic features of the game, and it has not been thoroughly tested for 
balance and bug fixing.  Everything we know about EverQuest can change
during beta testing, as we discover what works and what doesn't.  So,
keep that in mind, and read on for some new information.
