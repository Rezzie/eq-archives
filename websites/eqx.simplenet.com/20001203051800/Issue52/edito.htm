Recently I have had an e-mail exchange with a reader about role-playing, where we discussed role-playing and what environments or games are appropriate.  In this discussion, the reader had a well thought out list of which MUD, MUSH or MOO environments are better or worse for role-playing.
<br><br>
I disagreed with him, and wrote the following statement:
<br><br>
<center><em>Role-playing is the level of interaction and adaptation/reaction to the game desired by the player, and is independent of the game environment.</em></center>
<br>
	One can role-play any game, whether it be EverQuest, a MUD or board game.  Monopoly, after all, is a game where all the players are early 20th century real-estate tycoons in Atlantic City.  It, too, can be role-played.  It is, however, up to the player to engage the role-playing aspect of the game.
<br><br>
	Why do we play role-playing games?  There are many reasons I can imagine: The desire to excel, the wish for community, the excitement of discovering new things, the urge to re-create a fictional role which inspired us, or the urge to create a new role, a new persona in an environment unlike the real world.  The unifying theme in all these reasons, for me, is the re-engaging of my sense of wonder.
<br><br>
	In our daily lives, we rarely encounter something that makes us wonder. We've seen the scenery on our everyday trips to work so many times we sometimes find ourselves at work with out having noticed a single thing on the trip.  We come home from work to the same apartment or house, we park the same car in the same parking space.  Sure, we take vacations, but we have guide books to tell us what sights to see and how to get there fastest.  We do the same things everyday, and we lose our sense of awe and delight at the world around us.
<br><br>
	When I entered the beta test, I was amazed.  The world of Norrath wasn't that large, but what existed immersed me completely in a world populated with the wizards and warriors of fantasy.  Seeing my first troll, when I was playing a dwarf, was so realistic and fantastic that I truly felt my character's awe and wonder at the size of it.  As your characters' perspective corresponds to their race's height, the troll towered over my dwarf, I had to look up to see it.  The 3D environment in EverQuest is something unimaginably real.
<br><br>
	I have been playing for a few months; I was the unlucky soul who wrote "<a href="../Issue35/quest.htm">What the QUEST means in EverQuest</a>".  I've made charts and compared level gains across most of the classes and races, and also just played for the sake of playing.  I am still experiencing that sense of wonder, the game is not dull to me yet.  There are times that I get bored with a character, or disappointed in their progress, but I still return to the game because I am constantly shown something new and thrilling.
<br><br>
	Recently Phase 3 started, and with the thousands of players came jarring reminders that this is not a fantasy world.  Despite 989's requests that characters names follow a fantasy theme and a server to check names, I saw a character named Elfrapist. In talking with the guides, I heard many examples of players actively creating offensive names.  Much admin time was wasted tracking down a player and advising them that their name was inappropriate, and then the player actively making another offensive name, in hopes that it would slip by, or not even caring if it did or not, just being a pain.  
<br><br>
	I saw players shouting across zones gameplay questions that were in the manual, and I actually heard of players quitting the beta test because there was "nothing to do" or it was "too hard".  This after a couple of HOURS of play.  Wouldn't you like to have their phase 3 CD? At the same time, I get almost daily e-mails from Phase 3 friends about how incredible the game is, and how much fun they are having.
<br><br>

<br>
	Classifying the gaming audience into Role-players and Powergamers is common.  The "role-players" are those fruity types who speak in thees and thous, and the "Powergamers" are those insensitive player-killer types whose lust for power has them raping the game for more items, gold, and experience, overrunning anything in their path.  I think there may be a different way of classifying players.
<br><br>
	Some players wish to engage the environment, and some don't.  Those who enter deeply into the environment, seeking to add to the immersion for others and themselves, truly become role-players.  Those who accept the game mechanics and seek to excel in them powergame, but still add to the atmosphere of danger and competition.  Others fall outside of both categories and don't see the game as anything but pixels and some other idiots running around acting as if the environment mattered.  Unfortunately, those who don't engage the environment also make it difficult for those who do.  
<br><br>
	EverQuest is an excellent environment, and is all-inclusive.  You can interact with it as much or as little as you want.  I hope that whether you role-play or powergame, you decide to engage Norrath and accept it as a world whose fictional existence deserves to be treated with the respect you give the real world.
