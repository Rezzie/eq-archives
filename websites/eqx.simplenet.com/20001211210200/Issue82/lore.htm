Ok.  I've been playing EQ for about a month now, and overall, I think it's a nice game.  Sure, it's got some flaws and there are a ton of things that can make it better, but one of the things I really like is how this game evolves and is never truly a finished product.
<br><br>
Anyways, as I've been playing I've been thinking about what seems lacking in this game.  From a strategy standpoint, this game is great.  I know I've only been playing a month, but this game seems to have about as much strategy involved in it as a RTS game (I mean Real Time Strategy, not Runed Totem Staff).  Verant has balanced this game extremely well in my opinion, and although there are some classes that are unbalanced, overall the job is great and those unbalanced classes will get fixed... So I'm optimistic about that.
<br><br>
The thing that I'm concerned about, like many others, is the role-playing aspect of EQ.  Every time I say goodbye to a player on EQ, I find myself saying "happy hunting."  Why?  Because, as uncountably many people before me have said, it seems like that's all there is to do.  Sometimes it just feels like this games more like a combat simulator than an RPG.  A really fun and strategic combat simulator, but still, it doesn't seem like the RPG I wish it was.
<br><br>
There's a reason for that, and I don't think it's solely because the game is centered around combat.  Let me explain a theory of mine.
<br><br>
The first experience I had in online gaming was when I played an LPMUD called KobraMUD about 4 years ago.  Kobra was a sci-fi MUD that centered around the Star Wars universe, and was an incredibly immersive experience for me, more so than EverQuest--and Kobra's world was made up solely of text, unlike EQ's which combines text with graphics and sound.
<br><br>
Imagine a MMORPG set in the Star Wars universe that revolved around combat, just like EQ.  You could be any race, you could be a Jedi or dark Jedi, mercenary or rogue; you could fly your x-wing through space and go to any planet in the Star Wars universe; Naboo, Tatooine, Alderaan, Dagobah, ANYWHERE.  Let's say this game's universe is as big as Norrath, with each planet corresponding to a zone, or something like that.  The MMORPG is pretty much analogous to EQ in all its gameplay aspects... there are some trading skills, but in general you kill things to gain experience and become a better Jedi, along with some quests (ok, there are a lot of things I'm not covering here but just stay with me for a bit).
<br><br>
No, I'm not trying to say that LucasArts should make a Star Wars MMORPG (albeit it would kick ass).  What I'm saying is that I think such a MMORPG would be more immersive than EQ.
<br><br>
Why would it be more immersive?
<br><br>
The answer, I think, is lore.  Just think, when you went to Tatooine, you could visit Mos Eisley, visit the Cantina and Jabba's Palace.  What makes these locations exciting places to visit?  It's not just the fact that they've got cool architecture, or really weird looking aliens in them... it's the history behind them.  It's the fact that the place you're virtually "standing in" is the place where Luke Skywalker first met Han Solo, where Queen Amidala met Anakin, and all the other legends.  Why do we place such meaning on the pyramids of Egypt and the Statue of Liberty and the Berlin Wall?  Because of the history behind them.  There's this certain connection between yourself and the past when you're there that just gives the place some kind of meaning, because the context of history provides one with a sense of identity.
<br><br>
A beautiful world with really awesome textures and locations really doesn't mean much if there isn't any meaning behind them.  The first time I played EQ, I started out in Freeport, and boy did it suck.  All of the NPC's I tried talking to (merchants and guards) said nothing when I hailed them; essentially everyone except Cain Darkmoore and an innkeep and a high elf seemed to be entirely mute in the city, so I felt like I was in this lifeless, artificial city that had been established purely as a base for players to come to get food, water, and weapons.
<br><br>
This gave me absolutely no context in which I could role-play my character.  When one role-plays, they give their character beliefs and motivations and then step into the person's shoes to try to see the world from their point of view.  But those beliefs and motivations can't be established without some kind of environment... Was my character raised by kind, caring people or greedy thieves or heartless villians?  Why were those people kind and caring or greedy or heartless?  It was very hard to establish anything like this because I couldn't figure out why I was in Freeport or what I was trying to do, other than kill things to gain levels.  Sure, the little blurb I was given right after I created my character gave me a little bit to shape his beliefs, but the NPC's and players in the area I started out in did very little to reinforce those beliefs.
<br><br>
A few hours later, I decided to try a new character, this time starting him out in Surefall Glade.  That was much more fun, because the NPC's actually told me about why I was there and reinforced the beliefs and motivations I should know about when role-playing my character.  When I went to Queynos with this character and found out about Kane Bayle and the corrupt guards of Qeynos, I became interested in the political intrigue.  Almost every guard in Qeynos will talk to you if you hail them, and some of them voice their opinion on the issue of the corrupt guards and some of them stay silent, others are just rude... many of the merchants actually talk, and some give out quests.  Hearing the opinions of these virtual characters allowed my character to take a stance on the issues presented, which gave my character a sense of identity and belonging in the world of Norrath, making the game seem less like a combat simulator and more like a role-playing game.
<br><br>
Two weeks ago, I started a character in Freeport again, hoping to have more fun than I did the last time.  This time, I visited the Hall of Truth and learned of Sir Lucan and why the Freeport Militia existed, and about the strife between the followers of Marr and the Militia.  Even though I knew I was getting very little experience from doing the quest to deliver the letter to the Paladin who was going undercover into the Freeport Militia, it was still fun because I was actually unraveling a mystery, and giving my character a better sense of identity; the quest was shaping my character's beliefs, thoughts, and ideology.  Put simply, this mere quest converted Freeport from a meaningless, ugly place to get supplies into a place that had its own atmosphere, its own reason for existing in a fantasy world; and that made it a much more fun place to explore.
<br><br>
So in conclusion, I'm basically saying that I think the story matters just as much as the gameplay aspects of EQ, and it even contributes to the gameplay aspects through the use of quests.  Providing historical lore to the players gives them a reason for playing their character and allows them to become more immersed in the world so that they can do things other than just fight and kill.  Giving more of a history to Norrath could help unite the players in a common "heritage" for their characters, so people could have conversations about things other than what weapon is better to kill things with.  Maybe there would be more philosophical and theological discussions about the nature of politics in Norrath--sure, it's a long shot, but hey, people do it with Star Wars, don't they?  I've been using Star Wars as an example here because it's something that's enjoyed by the mass public (like EQ), has a lot of spectacle and involves a lot of violence (like EQ), but at the same time provides a lot of meaning for the audience through its use of story.  It's that last part that I think Verant could really stress a bit more on, because that's what makes EQ an RPG... otherwise it's a combat simulator.  And I don't think that the last part has to be solely beneficial for role-players: even the fans of Star Wars that were interested in the space combat and lightsaber duels (i.e., the "powergamers" in this analogy) still enjoyed the story a great deal, because it made the combat scenes even more exciting.  Or perhaps I'm just digging a bit too deep with this Star Wars analogy.
<br><br>
So here are some things I've been thinking of that wouldn't be too hard to implement, since they wouldn't require the addition of any new "features" in the programming sense:
<br><br>
* Make new quests meaningful ones that allow the player to better role-play their character, and give them a better sense of identity.  Examples of quests which do NOT do this and are just plain stupid and lame and don't even give any good XP or loot are: the quest to take a stupid cup of drinking water to each sentry in the Temple of Marr in alphabetical order, the quest to go to Qeynos and get the statue from Nestiff Tallaherd and deliver it back to a guy at Surefall Glade.  I can't think of any others right now, but there are a lot of these, and they really do give static quests a very bad name.  Even if a quest doesn't give incredibly good loot or XP, if it still manages to intrigue me in the way it helps flesh out the world of Norrath, it's still worth it (though good loot and XP are still a plus).
<br><br>
* Make the NPC's talk more!  Qeynos is a perfect example of a place where almost every single NPC has something interesting to say, even if it doesn't have anything to do with a quest... as long as it makes the world seem more alive and less like this generic high fantasy place that was built for killing things and gaining XP, it's all good.  A prime example of a town that really needs this kind of treatment is Neriak... heck, the only reason I feel my dark elf necromancer should hate others is because every time he said 'Hail father' and 'Hail mother' they just stared at him and said nothing!  Seriously, 90% of the NPC's in this town are totally mute and make the place really boring... the city itself is awesome in its architecture and layout, but there's absolutely nothing in there that gives my character the slightest inkling of WHY he's supposed to hate things!
<br><br>
* Make tomes of history and books filled with legends.  They'd be just like the instruction books for trade skills, except they'd have stories about the lore and history of Norrath, written by famous bards and warriors and mages and whatnot.  There are a lot of locations in Norrath that look absolutely beautiful, and they'd be a million times more interesting if there was some in-game history behind them.  For example, I think the ruins in the North Ro desert are actually the topmost levels of the lost city of the Elves that Solusek Ro buried several thousand years ago, but I haven't found any NPC's that talk about this or give me any information about it... Befallen looks like a really cool place, but I have absolutely no idea why it exists, where it came from, or why it's plagued with undead.  I also know that there's a more extensive history of Norrath available on the Web, but why not make it a book that someone could buy for 1 gp?  Heck, they could even turn some of the fan fiction that's been written about Norrath into novels that could be bought in city stores.  I have a feeling that Verant may have intended to do this with tomes of history, since there is a library of history in the 3rd gate of Neriak which doesn't currently serve any practical function... but I could see that it may have been originally intended for this purpose.  Even in the powergaming sense, such tomes could be useful--in a recent post, Brad McQuaid mentioned that a lot of good items could be found in the less-populated zones if only players took the time to explore places they hadn't been to yet... well, perhaps some tomes could be written that give rumours of treasure in far-off ruins, or rare items being posessed by creatures in far-off lands... such tomes could even be the catalysts for static quests that don't have to involve NPC's.
<br><br>
All of these things would probably not require any new programming on the part of Verant... They'd just take a little bit of thinking through, and some writing of dialogue and text and such--all of which could be done by GM's, perhaps even guides or volunteers if they were given the priveleges.  Unfortunately, though, I'm sure GM's and the rest of Verant have many more priorities that must get done beforehand to satisfy the powergamers and strategists out there... but if you guys at Verant ever get tired of programming or frustrated with balancing gameplay issues, you could always try taking a break by adding some more lore to the world of Norrath--it'd sure make the game a lot more fun for role-players and powergamers alike.
