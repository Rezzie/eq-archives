He has been working with 989 studios almost from the beginning of the EQ beta project, and he's here today to answer some questions about himself. </em>

<td valign="top">As for my RPG experience...I started with Paper and pencil RPGs with Armchair General's Blackmoor, Eldritch Wizardry, Greyhawk, and Dieties Demigods and Heroes… what would become the "white boxed set" in 1976. I've played a myriad of paper and pencil games, pretty much all of them that came out in the 70's and 80's. When computer games were available, I dove into them...Wizardry, Bards Tale, the Infocom text games, etc. I've played most of them as well, enjoying some, not others. My MUD/MUSH experience began about 5 years ago, but until they went at least semi-graphical, they did not hold my interest much.   I played Neverwinter, Darksun Online, a smattering of Meridian, and Beta Tested Empyria. I was in both phases of UO's Beta, and played the release as both Counselor and player for 6 months or so.
