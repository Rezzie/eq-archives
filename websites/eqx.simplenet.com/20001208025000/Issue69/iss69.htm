    "No!" snapped Thingal.  "Not from the chest, you idiot.  You are heaving like a storm-tossed sea.  What have we been talking about all day?  From here!"  The Elf smacked Amgho in the belly with his flute.  "Here!"  Thingal laid a slim hand on his own stomach and inhaled hugely<b>...</b>

	Set into the cliffs and trees of the Greater Faydark, Felwithe is a Capitol of all that is Elven and Magical in Norrath. Here dwell the Noble Elves, children of Tunare and wisest of the races in Norrath. In this beautiful City can be found a variety of professions and skills, and some of the leading masters of thought. Here are bred some of the finest spell-casters, zealous Paladins and holy clerics Norrath has to offer. In this is also one of the best opportunities for the patient role-player to shine.

My name is Srella.  Srella the Enchantress of Ale.  I consider myself to be quite cheerful for a dark elf, and at the weekly sacrifices to Innoruuk I am often the only one smiling.  Some think I smile because I like the blood, and while that is true to a degree I really smile just to be friendly.

Darkness had never been my friend.  Throughout the course of my short but exciting life, the night had always seemed to bring far too much danger and mystery - things that could jump out and eat me alive if they felt the need - and that thought was never too comforting.  Being an Elf, my infravision had only helped slightly, as I could see my enemies… but not the land surrounding me.  I stroll over the wrong hill, and suddenly I'm running for my life.  Magic didn't help much either.  I had neither the bright flash of fire and ice that my Wizard kindred had nor the unique ball of light that Magicians could throw in front of them.  I was, and still am, an Enchanter, a unique class that most people seem to disregard as trivial.

I just finished talking to a friend of mine.  This friend, along with some others, have been playing on a different server than I do.  And yet, he wants me to start a character and join his group…  But he's already 9th level, and I already have a main character to play (along with a real serious desire to play another one) on a different server.  This situation is one that causes some folks a bit of stress about the way EverQuest is set up.  Some folks can't play as often as their friends, and others just started later.  So is there a way to catch up and keep up?  First, read <a href="parttime.htm">this article</a> by Foxglove...

Immersiveness. Complete conscious and subconscious immersiveness. I often have dreams about games about which I'm currently obsessing. Diablo, Baldur's Gate and Starcraft have been recently invading my sleep. However, none of those games were more than pixellated recreations of what appeared on the screen in front of me hours before falling into slumber.</em>
