<b><em>   Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
 I have a rather odd problem. I am a male warrior of about 20th level. But on occasion, I like to dress up as a newbie female (one with most conspicuous cleavage) and flirt shamelessly with high level characters, for goodies. I love women, but I've also found that while I'm in womanly guise, people treat me much nicer, and give me things, just for being cute. Could I be having an identity crisis?

<b>	   Dear Granrico
<br><br>
Moog say, no problem here!  It fun to play dress-up.  Moog do same thing, but, no one believe that she a wood elf.  Even in wood elfie leather bikini…maybe Granrico tell Moog his secret?

<br><br><br>

<em>   Dear Auntie Moog, Wheres a good place for a hot wood elf chick to hook up with hunks for good times and heavy hunting? All the men i meet are either taken or too quiet to keep me entertained.

<b>   Dear Anon and Gargatox,
<br><br>
Ooooh!  Moog say you two are made for each odder!  Tell Moog where you want to meet, I set up a date for you.

<em>Dear Anutie Moog I am a questing Monk from the lands of Qeynos.  As of late I have been adventureing with a lovely little elven spellslinger.  Now she has said she wants me to visit her homelands with her.  I would love to travel with her but need to know if this sort of a step makes us a more significant gameing couple.
