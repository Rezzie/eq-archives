Are you bored?
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new generation of gaming just hit the market!  
<br><br>
Razor what the hell are you talking about?
<br><br>
Let me first say I have never liked Sierra Games.  I'm just not into Leisure Suite Larry games, and Kings Quest bored me to tears!  The "mouse click everywhere till you find something" never did a THING for me!
<br><br>
Last week while recovering from a gall bladder surgery (which is another story in itself), a friend of mine called me on the phone.
<br><br>
"Razor holy cow!  You just have to get this game!" He said with excitement in his voice.  
<br><br>
"Man calm down.  Talk to me!" I said, trying to get the full story.
<br><br>
"This game..   This game.. Oh my god.." He stormed on for an hour about how great this new release was.
<br><br>
I finally got the title out of him.  A new game from Sierra called "Half Life".  
<br><br>
Now usually Hammy and me like pretty much the same type of games so I sent my son out for a copy.  After he cruised town in my car for two hours he returned home with the box.
<br><br>
"Thanks" I scuffed.  
<br><br>
I ripped open the box and installed the game.  
<br><br>
In the beginning of the game you think your watching an intro.  It's a train running underground.  While watching this cut scene I accidentally moved the mouse and to my surprise my view changed!  Holy cow I'm already playing!  This was no cut scene at all.  So now that I know I can move about the train I start checking out my surroundings.  It had beautiful graphics, and at 800x600 OGL, I had no framing problems what so ever!
<br><br>
I got off the train and the guard started walking with me and greeted me.  I could fully interact with all my surroundings and the people in it.  "This is great," I said out loud.
<br><br>
You enter this top-secret facility and move about the building freely.  Everyone kept reminding me that I was late for an appointment in the lab.  I had a hell of a time finding that lab! *laugh*  The place is huge.  The story is great, it has a plot that will suck you in.  Using some sort of skeletal mapping the movement of the NCP's in the game is simply incredible.  The aliens are truly creepy!
<br><br>
So if you're waiting to get into the EverQuest beta, and want something to do this is the perfect buy!  This game has truly restored my interest in 3D shooters.  The puzzles in the game are abundant and the action is incredible.  You will truly love this game!
