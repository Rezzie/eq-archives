I have to be honest.  I have not been very impressed with games in the last year.
<br><br>
Total Annihilation was a good indication of what was possible in the
future, but it fell prey to the age old problem of "rushing" (building 
dozens of cheap little units to swarm your enemy).  Myth was a welcome 
renovation of the realtime combat genre, but I had trouble with controlling everything at once.  Beyond that, everything with blockbuster potential fell into distaste due to cheaters or PKs.  
<br><br>
The good news is 1998-1999 will be a much more exciting period for online multiplayer gaming, and we gamers are chomping at the bit to get our hands on the next wave of options.  FireTeam is merging voice technology with excellent gameplay to bring home a whole new gaming experience.  Urban Assault is seamlessly combining realtime strategy with first person shooter to define a whole new genre of gaming.  EverQuest and Asheron's Call are providing submersive virtual worlds to explore, which should take what Origin started and bring it to a higher level.  The list goes on.
<br><br>
These games give us a lot to look forward to, and we know it.  EverQuest is a shining example of a game that has had a consistent online community devoted to it before it ever reached beta.  EQ already has such a powerful presence, that web sites devoted to it typically get an average of 200-1100 unique visitors each day.  Now granted I am no expert at hosting web pages, but the one page I did create was for a PSX game titled Carnage Heart, and it finished its life span with a mere 6600 total hits.  Any EverQuest site will probably beat that in less than a few days.  The bottom line is, for a game that hasn't even reached beta, this is an amazing position to be in.
<br><br>
And it's not just numbers of people that make the difference, it is also their quality and dedication.  The people that follow these games are emphatically dedicated.  It is the equivalent of their religion.  Sure some people may just have a passing interest, but if you post an article on the web with any negative comments about one of these games, you can bet you'll hear about it.  Trust me, I know.  But that only serves to support the fact that these games have what it takes to pique our interest and make us excited.  I, for one, am very pleased at the support everyone is giving to the games that deserve it.  I was glad to receive heated replies on the EverQuest vs Asheron's Call topic.  More importantly, though, it brought out a lot of information and gave us some juicy tidbits into what we can expect when we get our hands on these games.
<br><br>
Judging from the excitement level in the gaming community as a whole, the next 12 months will be a dream come true.
