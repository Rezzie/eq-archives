It's long been a belief of mine that dark places attract dark specimens.  Creatures of Norrath are after all creatures of attraction.  And no one I've ever known espouses the idea of opposites attracting.  We all know the truth that sunlight attracts pleasant dispositions, and the shaded pits attract the maggots.
<br><br>
Beneath the blackest set of mountains in North Karana, the mill called Kurgwin mill cut a sinister profile.  It's visage was a scowling jack-o-lantern, the lights in the windows combining with the pealing paint and dark moss to create the illusion of the head of a leper, barely clinging to life.  I knew not what its daytime colors were, but the place had an otherworldly aura, as if perhaps it never saw daylight at all, but instead rested here in its corner of Norrath with a cowl black as night pulled over itself.  The blackened hills gave the illusion of a line of solemn tombstones, jutting roughly skyward as time and weather played with their shape and orientation.
<br><br>
The trees nearby were eerily white, their bark having pealed from the seemingly contagious leprosy that claimed the mill.  Dark figures stirred inside the building, causing the light to flicker, their circular movement lending to the illusion of a head with shadowed swirling thoughts.
<br><br>
Yes, evil attracts evil.  And I planted my feet on the stoop, unafraid of anything that waited beyond the aged cedar and pine planks.  It felt a bit like home.
<br><br>
Water still flowed nearby.  Despite this, the paddle wheel only showed the slightest agitation as it rocked a few inches too and fro, merely buffeted by the current rather than enlivened.
<br><br>
There was a singing of predators in the distance.  Their cacophony resonated across the tombstone hills, distorting the tones so as to make them something between those of wolf and man.
<br><br>
The moon was somewhere overhead, bandaged in a thin gauze of clouds, light bleeding through in small drips.  I noted the way the shadows fell from the building in all directions, as if it were casting darkness from it like a beacon.  It reminded me of signal fires that humans light on the shore to warn ships that they are close to land.  If these dark tendrils were a warning, perhaps they were a portent of the corrupt souls that dwelled within.
<br><br>
My footfalls did not go unheard, yet those within did not rush to the defense of their decaying castle.  Instead they continued to sputter about within, audibly walking the creaking floorboards, scuffing their heels and making an occasional groan.
<br><br>
The door opened on queue, seeming to know that I was ready for it to open.
<br><br>
Beyond the frame was a figure clad in white blouse and trousers, both grown brown with time and great quantities of dried blood.  He stood at my height, his pale skin flecked with fresh spots of red, his gray hair actually seeming tarnished compared to the bright silver locks of his kin.
<br><br>
"Kurgwin," I said flatly, stating a fact.  Oh perhaps there was a bit of accusation to my tone.  Not like I said, 'Murderer' or 'blasphemer' or somesuch.  I kept my voice steady with a mild undertone of amusement.
<br><br>
The fettered High Elf nodded and stepped back.  The other figures in the room were seemingly inattentive, choosing to continue their orbit about Kurgwin as if they were many dead moons hopelessly trapped in his pull.
<br><br>
"Do you partake?" he asked, his eyes cast toward an assemblage of casks stacked in the corner beneath a wall which was decorated with many a leather wineskin.
<br><br>
"Partake?" I said, my amusement becoming more evident, "Yes, one might say that."
<br><br>
He pointed toward a table and before I could figure out what he wanted, two of his dark satellites stepped toward the table and dragged it toward the pile of casks.  They then seized two chairs and did likewise with them.  Then they resumed their orbit, falling into place between the others.
<br><br>
I counted six such men of varying sizes.  Some were very short, one very large.  He had a mixed bag of subjugates.  Most likely he had taken his favorite victims from the corners of Norrath and made them his personal guard.  Posthumously, of course, as there were few living beings outside of Neriak who would willingly serve such a dark spirit.
<br><br>
I sat in the chair closest to the casks and skins so as to face the room, and also so as to be closest to the alcohol.  Kurgwin sat across the table, but not before making a motion with his hands.  At once all of the wandering husks of men fell to the ground like a glove whose hand had been withdrawn.
<br><br>
"Make your selection," he said, "Many are marked."
<br><br>
I fumbled through the casks and skins, pulling anything with an overt symbol belying the greatness of the nectar within.  Some were unmarked and I paused at each skin to remove the cork and sniff.  I then set them all about me in a circle.
<br><br>
"Orbit me, my children" I said half-mockingly.  Kurgwin seemed to either not care that I was mocking or to simply have not noticed.
<br><br>
We each took pours from the drink for the next few minutes, taking breaks to discuss the area I had ventured into to find him.
<br><br>
"Was this place so deliciously morose when you found it, or did it take some fixing up?" I asked.  "I always wanted a summer place much like this."
<br><br>
"The moment I first entered this place I knew I was home.  It was like trying on a custom made helm.  It makes me feel like there is nothing that can get to me." He said between drinks while I nodded in agreement.
<br><br>
"Yet you open your door to strangers," I said.
<br><br>
"There are two types of strangers, dark skin.  There are strangers who fear and strangers who need.  You are the latter.  I did not smell fear."
<br><br>
I drank to that.
<br><br>
"I am not the sort to normally deal outside my kind," I said attempting to preface my inquiry.  With other races, even with corrupted beings, some mild honesty can help gain a modicum of confidence.
<br><br>
"I have come in search of a lost relic of my family."
<br><br>
He continued to stare, his hair masking his eyes with their shadows, the light of the torches behind him illuminating his form, highlighting the beginnings of a hunch in his back.  He drank some more, the cup coming back to the wood of the table with a resonant knock.
<br><br>
The fire lit beneath a large metal vat supplied much of the light in the room.  He had spent quite a few copper on that thing.  I could smell something within that reminded me vaguely of stew.
<br><br>
He glanced at the vat, as if following the rays of my eyes to their destination.
<br><br>
"Smells like meat."
<br><br>
"Would you like some?"
<br><br>
I lightly shook my head 'no'.  "Bet it tastes just like aviak."
<br><br>
This elicited a small chuckle from him.
<br><br>
"So what is it you seek?  Specifically?"
<br><br>
"There was a farmhouse in Nektulos.  It sat not far from Lavastorm.  Today all one might find are a few fire-blackened splinters of wood.  But once a family dwelled therein.  One of them wore a ring."
<br><br>
"An opal, " he said, "with some sort of defect.  Like a dark spot in its depths."
<br><br>
"You do yet have it," I smiled.
<br><br>
"It is here."
<br><br>
He stood and walked to the far side of the room and opened a small sack that dangled from a nail in the mantle of an unused fireplace.  There was no need for any other fire with the heat radiating off of that vat.  He palmed something from the bag and walked back.  He produced the ring and set it on the table before me.
<br><br>
"Why, of all the places in Norrath, would you come this far and assume the ring you sought was here?"
<br><br>
"Because, it seems, that its darkness was suited only to this place."
<br><br>
I picked it up.  My father's ring.  Its imprint was still found in various places on my body that once blossomed with purple and black bruises.  Many a chunk of skin had been claimed by it's edge when he was moved to violence by someone who tried to dictate the price of his merchant goods or who served him a watered drink in a tavern.  The blemish beneath its face was an inexplicable imperfection in the opal that had made the thing seem somewhat magical to me as a child.
<br><br>
I had searched the ruins of our farmhouse following the fire that claimed my family.  Searched for days actually, until hunger overtook me and I had to make for town.  I had always assumed that someone would find the thing and that eventually it would find its way here.
<br><br>
He seemed satisfied with my simple answer.  A pleasant, tight little smile even developed on his face as he now knew that I recognized the truth of dark attracting dark.
<br><br>
My childhood home had been a place of evil acts and cruel deeds perpetrated simply for the purpose of suffering.  It was a house not unlike this mill, with frequent visitors who seemed drawn to the place.  I had once tried to leave it, but its aura seemed like the same pull the scholars speak of when they discuss what keeps us from falling into the sky.  It seemed like gravity or magic.  It seemed like the same force that holds Kurgwin's dead to his whim.  It wasn't until that place burned that I escaped.
<br><br>
In my many travels as a pack animal, lugging merchant wares for my father, I had only come across one place that had the same haunted feel as my home.  This mill.  And I knew that if the ring could not populate one place because it was gone, it would come to the other.
<br><br>
The ring was mine.  I wasn't quite sure what I wanted with it.  I surely didn't plan to wear it.  Besides, my finger was too small for it.  I didn't plan to sell it.  It just seemed like the last relic from my childhood and it needed tending.
<br><br>
"What would you like for it," I offered.
<br><br>
He pushed his chair in on his side of the table and walked back to his vat, seizing the stirring stick.
<br><br>
"There is no charge.  Whatever deep sea into which you throw it or whatever endless pit in which you bury it, you realize it will be back here sometime later?"
<br><br>
I arose and opened the door and stepped out into the night.  I heard the squish of decayed flesh and the mild crackle of bone as Kurgwin's minions arose to resume their circular march about him.  And I returned to Neriak with but a simple casting of a spell.
<br><br>
There I stood, no longer in the dark halls of the mill, but in the spot where once my home had stood.  I spit on the soil and walked away.
<br><br>
I thought of dissolving the ring in the magma pits that dot Lavastorm, but I had slain enough fire elementals to know that often goods can be retrieved from within them, in tact.  Instead I went to the place from which these things are born, long before they are smelted and polished and shaped into being.  I took the damned ring to the elemental plane of hate, and gave it back to the place where Teir'Dal were first conceived of.
<br><br>
And I returned home, no richer nor poorer than when I left, having walked amid the tombstones, spoken with the dead, and exorcised the last spirit of a dismal life.
