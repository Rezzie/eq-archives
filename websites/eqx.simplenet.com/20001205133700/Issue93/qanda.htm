<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be so wonderful if EQ Express could be delivered straight before your waiting eyes, but hope you won't mind seeking it out as you have been doing so far.  If you create a bookmark for us, however, try checking on the newest edition about midafternoon or so on Saturdays.  I'm really glad you like EQ Express and thank you for writing with the compliment and the question.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a wizard about to hit level 16 and start my research. My question is what's the best way to learn other languages?
<br>
Ylander
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations on your progress toward excellence in wizardry.  I wasn't entirely sure how to learn languages myself (beyond those I learned as a young child), so I applied to my guild friends for their advice.  First, they told me to tell you to visit Dantrin, our resident wiz and language expert, but since I don't know which server you play on, that might not be possible.  You do have a couple of options, however.  You might wish to put in practice points in the languages available to you at your guild.  It is possible to at least begin to learn a new language in this fashion.  A much cheaper and faster route, however, is to find someone who is a master of the language you wish to learn and have the language maven group with you and give you a steady flow of advice, i.e., spam, in the chosen lingo.   It may seem as if you haven't learned the language, but if you zone, you should then see the results.  I did ask people if such language teachers expected remuneration and the general consensus was yes, but it should be reasonable.  Good luck on your researching and in your journeying.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering about the ever-mysterious deities. I am a follower of the Lord of Flame, and was curious as to his disposition to me, should I ever be so fortunate as to run into him when traversing the Planes. I am not particularly scholarly as of yet, with no real knowledge of the Planes. I am not even sure of the existence of a Plane of Flame. I would prefer to be able to converse with my deity, but if this is somewhat dangerous I will never attempt it.  Speaking of Solusek Ro, I have recently heard rumors of plans to construct a Temple in his Name. I am of a rather dubious background, and as such would have considerable trouble making a pilgrimage to Felwithe or Erudin. Do you know where this Temple is to be built?
<br>
Vakor
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The deities and their whereabouts are indeed quite mysterious.  I travel around a good deal and have yet to meet one, for which I think I'm pretty grateful.  However, although I have never heard of a Plane of Flame, it seems reasonable to me that the gods of Norrath will eventually have well-developed communities of followers who might wish to erect temples and monuments to their divine masters.  To date, though, I'm sorry that your question can't receive a definite answer as I simply haven't heard of such a Temple.  If you find out more about it, I'd love to hear from you.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sent a few questions in the past, but this is not quite the same. I am Teir'Dal, though I have been rejected into the Spurned for my choice to study wizardry. Due to my worship of the Lord of Flame, I can freely walk the streets of Freeport. Obviously, I have no wish to wander through such a hovel, with the beautiful city of Neriak so close. However, on my wider journeys, I did visit Oggok. I found myself chased out of that city before I could even see a single impressive remnant of their Empire. Why would the humies not mind my patronage, while the ogres do?
<br>
Vakor
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogres I've run into, errr run away from, seem to have a hearty appetite for elvish meals, and are known to find the scarce dark elf dish quite a delicacy.  So my guess is that while it seemed that you were being chased out of the city of Oggok, in all probability those chasing you figured they were getting a little exercise to work up their appetite.  As for Freeport, possibly the most unpredictable of all cities,  it might help to remember that corruption reigns free, particularly under the sway of Sir Lucan, so the humans who welcome you probably do so with an eye to their pocketbook rather than to their sense of racial morality or friendliness.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I often wondered if there was a simpler way to switch between your "hotboxes" or whatever they're referred to.  It seems really difficult to keep moving my mouse over to the little arrow in the middle of battle or if I needed to say something I put in a macro.  Thanks.
<br>
Dadien  
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is a simple keyboard method to access the different banks of hotkeys.   If you hold down the shift key and type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, you can gain quick keyboard access to each of the sets of hotkeys.  I know I have a set of hotkeys for quick access to useful bard songs, another set up for melee weapon and instrument changes, and a third one set up for traveling, so the shift key is definitely a help.  By the way, I'm still planning to compile all the information I can find on the creative ways people use hotkeys to help play Everquest and I'll try to get that going soon.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, fellow bard!  I need your assistance, or  mayhaps assistance from other bards.  You see, I left my home town of Kelethin a wee bit early and skipped bard school in search of adventure.  I'm paying for it now.  Many a night me and my friends would be sitting at a campfire, winding down from a hard day's battles and they ask me to sing them a song.   I don't know any songs!  I don't mean battle songs or any other magical songs, I mean just regular ballads detailing heroic deeds of times past.  Just stories I can sing over a tankard of ale.  Now, I am sure a bard of your renown has sung some spells to audiences before.  Could you mayhaps send me some songs you have sung or created yourself via Antonican Bard's Mail?  I will give you full credit for your work (or anyone's) when I sing it.  I just want to be a true bard and sometimes sing a story-song.  The more songs I have, the happier I will make my friends (and strangers too!).   In fact, I think with some submissions, I can get an idea of how to make my own songs and can begin to do so.  But for right now, I am in desperate help.  I admire you so, Nepenthia!
<br>
Amistad, Erollisi Marr
<br>
 P.S. - To all you youngins, stay in school
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well thank you for the compliment and I'd be glad to append a small silly song here for your collection.  However, the Soerbaird, a bard's guild of longstanding in Norrath, and one that has been responsible for many memorable concerts might be the best place for you to visit to fill in the gaps in your knowledge caused by your early hankering for adventure.  The address for the Soerbaird is http://www.soerbaird.com/guild/  and I invite you to visit it and see the accumulation of lore and ballads and lessons in bardic skills, particularly in their Library.  And now for a silly Nep ditty, one written long ago, published in these very pages,  and one that I hope will amuse your friends around a campfire:
<br><br>

<b>Ode to Cleavage</b>
<br><br>
Monsters, monsters, every where,<br>
Flashing teeth, flying hair. <br>
What shall a woman use to fight? <br>
Cleavage of course, breasts bound tight. 
<br><br>
Attack a gnoll, watch its eyes spin. <br>

Crush a bear, strike him down, <br>
Not with a sword, just a low gown.

No need to whine, no need to beg. <br>
Simply bend down, smile on your face, <br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This has probably been asked before...but is there ANY benefit in renting a room at a local "hotel" in a city??  I"ve noticed that you cant lock the doors, and really anyone could get in the room too…so is there any purpose other then Roleplaying in getting one??
<br>
Avercrom
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was some talk long ago of the rented rooms actually being useable, so far, to my knowledge, there is no benefit in renting a room at a local inn, no matter how charming or persuasive the innkeeper.  Thus, roleplaying is perhaps the only purpose for renting a room.    If the roleplay is not for public consumption, it is good to remember that the walls are thin and the doors have ears, so that often conversations conducted publicly (i.e., in /say) may be overheard.   I'm sure the innkeeps will charge me double (the next time I have the luxury of staying in a hotel) for extending this caveat to you, but it seems fair to pass along what I know.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm aware that Everquest uses both DirectX and Glide as screen engines. My question is, I *think* I'm using DirectX, and as I have a voodoo3 I would probably benefit from increased speed/ pretty effects / better screen resolution etc if I were to use Glide.   How do I tell it to change? If I go into options and click on the screen thingy, it merely says 'Primary screen driver' or something. I can't find any way to switch it over.   Can someone help here? The manual is desperately unhelpful.  *huggles*
<br>
The Shadowed One.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I'm not qualified to answer your questions or the one below.  Bards can usually tune their instruments and, if they had good teachers, can even make some of them, but DirectX and Glide screen engines are beyond my ken.  Don't give up hope though of getting some help.  Here are some places you can check:  1) First thing to do before anything else is to make sure you have the latest drivers for both DirectX and Glide.  Go to the EQ main website for information and links.  2) Second, for help with configuring your machine properly, you can email <A HREF="mailto:eqvideo@verant.com">eqvideo@verant.com</A> about your video questions.  Best thing to do there is to give them the complete specifications of your system and then ask them what you asked me.  You could also check with the the general tech department at Verant by email at <A HREF="mailto:eqtech@verant.com">eqtech@verant.com</A> (toll call at 619-554-0144) for help.  3) Finally, you can resort to the message boards on the major EQ fan sites or on the official EQ website at <A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/">www.everquest.com</A> and ask for help.  It's amazing how many people actually understand this and are willing to help.  Hope you do find the answers you're looking for.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My question relates to the use of DirectX and Glide in Everquest.  I believe I'm using DirectX, and would like to know how to switch to Glide for the increased speed/screen resolution etc.  Looking at the options on the front screen shows me only 'Primary display adaptor' and there doesn't appear to be any way to switch. Can anyone help me out here?
<br>
Chubby the Callous.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok I'm going to refer  you to the answer to the question just above because it looks like the same resources listed there should help you get switched over to Glide.  Good luck and I hope your video is soon in good shape.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The question last week was:   Q:  …(T)he Dwarves dropped an item I am sure is for a quest but I have been all over Kaladim and can not find who to give it to. Can you help me? The Item is Glynn and Glynda's Tongue, kinda gross. Thank you for any possible help. Ollimonger    Your answer was: A:  Eeewwwww, gross is right …. Truthfully, I have no idea what you should do with Glynn and Glynda's remaining bodily part but would suggest you keep asking players in the general vicinity as others may have some insights to share.   My observation is:  These dwarfs are bandits, and liable to attack anyone with a good Stormguard faction (or bad bandit faction).  It appeared to me the inquirer was wondering why they were attacked as well.  There is a way to turn them in for minor reward and faction bonus, but I didn't really care and destroyed the tongues.
<br>
Gart
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You're right, Ollimonger was asking about why he was attacked and I appreciate your response to clarify that.  I hope  you don't mind if I add to your comments by saying that every once in awhile, we all will run into inhabitants or critters of Norrath who don't seem to behave as we would have predicted.  It's good to remember that factions can be so hidden, i.e. corrupt nasties pretending to be good guys, that we may find ourselves attacked with no warning or preparation.    While its tempting to first think that the npc is bugged, it's more often true that there is more to the story than we have found so far.  Be sure to spend some time (at a safe distance or hidden) listening to what the npc may say in unguarded moments.  Also be alert for overheard comments as you travel because often the npc  you are wondering about will be the subject of comments and gossip.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really a question, but a further comment.  For those of you invisible or Monks Feigning Death, just remember -- EVERYTHING cons indifferently to you.  Don't think that won't change when you become visible or stand up.
<br>
Glandyth
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Glandyth, for writing.   In all probability you have saved some players grief with your timely warning.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In regards to the 'keeping track of skill numbers' inquiries I have read... I do not write them down (I did in Phase 4 Beta) nor do I keep them in a hand held computer (since level 13).  I use a neat program called EQParser (no they did not 'pay' me to send this question).  It keeps track of skills, AND, not only does it do that, but it can tell you battle info, like spells fizzled, total non-melee damage, total kick misses, total times stunned, total deaths, who has inspected you, Sense Heading fail/success percentage, etc.  The URL for it is http://kqp.mpog.com/EQParse/
<br>
Aalon, LVL 15 Monk, Veeshan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the tip!  I, too, have heard great things about the EQ Parser although I don't have the foggiest notion on how to set it up, much less use it.  I believe to use it, you would need to use the /log command in game which will put a complete log of your play session into your Everquest folder.    It's sounding intriguing.  Wonder where I can find someone to exchange explaining the details to me for a bard tune or recitation?
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question: a couple comments.   I have noticed there seems to be a debate going on here over the last two issues of EQX about whether quivers are useful or not while I don't want to get into that debate, I will hand over the facts.   It is true that once you have reached one arrow left in your ammo slot, the game will draw arrows from your inventory until you have none left.  However they must be identical arrows.  So if your normal arrow is a Class 2 wood point, and you have a couple stacks of Class 2 bone point, for example. You will receive the infamous "Out of Ammo" message when your wood point runs out, even though you still have the bone points there.  At that point you're either fumbling through your packs to load the bone points, or drawing blade and charging.   The quiver is the way around this problem.  Once you reach the "Out of Ammo" state, any arrows in your quiver are loaded automatically into your ammo slot, even if they were a different type than the arrow you had been firing.  So in my example above, if at least one of your bone points were in the quiver, you would automatically continue using the bone points when your wood points run out.   So the quiver makes it possible to mix-up your ammo types without wasting time fumbling through your packs.  Some people may find this useful, others not.
<br><br>
Also, recently there was a question about the usefulness of tailoring.  Up until recently, tailoring was bar none the hardest trade skill to stay in past patchwork, because studded and reinforced were so hard, materials were too rare, and the best things you could make (reinforced) were weaker than chain.  However with the recent trade patch, that is changing.  Studded and Reinforced has been made easier, and new recipes were implemented in the process although the books have been updated.  One of the recipes, however, has already been leaked.  You can now combine spider silk in your kit to create silk swatches, which you then can combine with a pattern to make silk robes and armor for mages.  While this is probably going to put the giant spider on the endangered species list, it also promises to make the transition from patchwork to studded leather a lot easier.  I have also heard rumors of tailored bone armor, however for now they remain rumors.  Hope this helps!
<br>
Nakoruru
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes your comments help tremendously and thanks for sending them in.  It's cool the poor underrated quiver actually can prove to be useful and it would be so wonderful if a tailor or two would use that silk for some pretty dresses for a bard.  It's true Freeport is a casual place where my day-to-day garb is acceptable and functional, but Felwithe and Erudin are different stories and I usually blush with embarassment  wearing dusty road armor in those grand halls.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another question/comment about tailoring. I noticed recently that there was a new tailoring pattern available: whip.  While I would not be able to use it when I made it, it seemed like fun to try.  Naturally I failed (and the pattern costs more than a platinum!) I even bought another copy of "How to Sew", hoping to find instructions. No reference.  Anyone know what kind of pelt I should use?  Or any other material.
<br>
Kolsed of the Ash Order
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately you'll have to keep searching for information on this one because the best I could come up with was a ranger declaring that there had to be bullhide somewhere in the game to make such a whip.   I'm reasonably sure this is not true since he did finally admit to me that he made it up!  Perhaps your journeys will bring you to a tailoring master who has found the secret.  I hope so.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a tailor who lives in GF and hunts black wolves. I made some nice cash and increased my tailoring skill by sewing patchwork armor, making many friends along the way. Then I figured it was about the time to upgrade my skill to studded armor. I invested some training in blacksmithing and traveled Freeport to buy iron ore. I made metal bits from the ore and studs from the metal bits. Then, tried to combine these metal bits with my lifetime savings: black wolf skins. I had always assumed that these are the "medium quality pelt" you need to make studded armor. Well, "they did not combine". I used the correct amounts, so that is not the problem. I also tried it with mist wolf skin and it didn't work either. What do I use for studded armor? I have checked Kelethin, Felwithe, Freeport and Kaladim, hunted all kinds of wolves around them and have never seen anything  called "medium quality wolf pelt". Is this item absent from the game? Did I just waste my time?
<br>
Kortus
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahhah, here's one I can answer from experience.  Yes there are wolves who drop medium quality wolf pelts as anyone who has grown up in the Qeynos area can tell you.  Even the Millers, usually found sitting around a fire near the entrance to Surefall, can tell you how extremely useful such pelts can be.  However, remembering back to those days and nights I spent racing around the hills, trying to avoid the wolves as much as engage them, it seems to me that medium quality pelts are fairly scarce.  I wish you luck in finding some.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in response to the last (or close to it) question in issue #92 about tailoring. Truth betold, it is actually good to tailor PW tunics and legs (as they seem only to seem trivial to me at 30, wierd I guess) and then start working on Silk (which I heard becomes trivial at 36)...plus, I have been told that the general success rate for  studded is low, but that makes it worth more. Look at it this way, I believe studded and reinforced are very good for rogues, druids, and rangers...this provides a great field of money.  And maybe, sooner or later, Verant will put in enchanter spells to enchant ore for the studs and bonings.
<br>
Meii  
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for adding to the store of knowledge on tailoring.  I appreciate you taking the time to write in.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer for the ranger curious about damage from spells: you will see a damage number when you cast a DD or a dam shield spell (ignite, burst of fire, or thistleshield); however, flame lick is a DOT spell so you will not get a damage number from it.  Flame lick is a great spell, that only gets better, though many do not know about its worth.  Flame lick takes off some AC from your target, the number increasing slightly with your level, though usually below 10 -- this makes them easier to hit.  Flame lick also does damage to your target over time.  Prior to the patch I cast flame lick on myself, and it brought my hitpoints down by 23 (at level 22), also consider that it prevented me from regening any hp's, so I concluded that flame lick does about 8 dam base plus your level to your target.  And it does all this for 10 mana!!!  You cannot beat that.  At lvl 22 flame lick does 30 dam to a target over time for 10 mana, and ignite does 37 damage for 30 mana, and flame lick takes off AC--clearly flame lick is more mana efficient.  Though Flame lick cannot be stacked so just cast it once, while ignite can be stacked.  I hope this shows that flame lick is one of the best spells for a ranger to use.  Another use of flame lick is as a super taunt, mobs hate to be DOT'ed so you can use flame lick to turn that mob off of your weaker mage groupmates.
<br>
Haldir Telcontar
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, more of an answer than a question...Adaanya asked in the last issue about amount indicators on Flame Lick and Healing spells.  Firstly, Flame Lick isn't a damage spell, its effect is actually to lower target AC.  And get them PO'd I suppose =).  Secondly, I'm not sure you ever get a number on healing spells.  My traveling companion, a dwarven cleric in the service of the Lord of the Underword, told me he never gets a number either.  Or at least that's what I think he was telling me, it's sometimes hard to understand him through the bottle of dwarven ale.
<br>
Jenix Dreamtracker, Ranger in the service of Tunare
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, and well met.  I am one who follows the tenets of the rangers.  As such, I have knowledge of our skills and abilities.  Flame lick is a spell that does damage over time.  (OOC: DoT)  The approximate duration is about 40 seconds.  It deals little damage (2pts) at a time (Every 3 seconds).  (OOC:  Healing spells NEVER give a message about how much healed.  However, I tell you right now, Minor Healing only restores 10 pts of hp.)  The next damage spell received is attained upon achieving your 15th season.  It is named Burst of Fire. (OOC: This gives you a damage message. 15 pts, usually, unless your target makes a successful save.)  I hope this information is useful.  'Til swords part.
<br>
Baratol Alaryn of Surefall GladeHalf-elven Ranger of 16 Seasons Erollisi Marr
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Haldir, Jenix and Baratol you have indeed upheld the honor and resourcefulness of the ranger class.  (Unlike some rangers I happen to know who when they aren't getting me killed, manage to get both me and themselves lost!  One has to wonder what their guildmaster taught them, but I'm not complaining because mostly, they, like rangers in general, are the kindest and most helpful travelling companions.)   Thanks for writing in with your knowledge and discoveries.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;More answers for the baking skill. Pie Tins and Muffin Tins must be bought from player potters or blackmsmiths. There is the small chance that a player could have sold one to a merchant, but that is the only way you could possibly find one. Usually it's pretty easy to get your hands on a Pie or Muffin Tin, just shout around and a blacksmith or potter looking for an extra platinum or two will answer.   As for the taste of Beetle Eye Pie Nepenthia, the natural taste of the eye is quite hot, and with the addition of spices, I'd suggest having lots of milk on hand when planning to eat the glowing pie!
<br>
Praelus Braveblade
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whew, Beetle Eye Pie sounds like a very hot treat indeed.  I will take your advice and make sure I've chilled some milk in a cold stream before I bite into the tasty pastie.  Thanks for the information on how to obtain pie tins and muffin tins.   Let's hope the potters and blacksmiths will charge a fair price so that the bakers will have a steady supply of baking pans.
<br><br>

Again, thanks to all who wrote with questions and comments.  It's great to hear from you.
