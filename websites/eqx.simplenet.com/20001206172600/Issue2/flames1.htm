    align="JUSTIFY"><big><big>T</big></big>here was something amiss that morning, like
    something in the air was bad. The pleasant folk gathered in the valleys beneath the Castle
    McQuaid like normal, but there was an uneasy feeling. The weather was fine for the time of
    year, but the wind held a bitter taste. I, Ian Ash, your scribe, traveled with caution to
    the commons to hear what Master Sphere might have to say about Lord McQuaid's plans. As we
    all know, Sphere, The Honorable Dach and I were busy with the construction of the EQU
    Towers. There were others that assist us, and surely many hundred underpaid construction
    workers as well. This matter of labor laws was certainly a sore spot amongst the less
    fortunate that gathered here in the commons, and I can only attest that it must have been
    the cause of the conflict that arose.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Master Sphere was for the fourth day proclaiming the progression of the
    EQU Towers, inviting those present to come and visit again. Cries escaped from a few that
    they did not expect to find much different at the towers than the week before, and cared
    not to listen to his Lordship's words of pride. Word spread that Sphere was here and soon
    others came to listen. Others came to ask him to leave.</font></td>
    <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="35%"><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p
    align="JUSTIFY">Saturnino, being the maverick he is - spoke first this day like so many
    days before. The tall warrior stood upon an embankment and called out over the crowd to
    Sphere.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;All right that's it! I'm tired of coming here every day and
    hearing about 40 times from different people about stupid things just to promote your damn
    tower. The commons is a place for people to come and address issues about the well being
    of our lands, and to ask questions of others. What do you think this place is for? Please
    stop shouting here about the stupidest little things to draw attention to your
    tower.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Sphere responded with the same grit any Lord would to a clansman.
    &quot;I'd advise you not to listen then, for I choose to speak. And another thing, you
    stretch the truth! I have not called out nearly 40 times about the tower, but a mere
    three. Surely you would prefer to continue discussing matters of scantly clad women than
    the matters of mine. No one is forcing you to come here, and no one has asked you to
    listen to me. Please think about it.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">My ears burned from the confrontation and I took a few steps back.
    Being a frail scholar, I disliked noise and upsetting emotions, let alone a possible
    public scuffle. </font></td>
    <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="31%"><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p
    align="JUSTIFY">Nay, there would be none that day, but others gathered near Saturnino in
    silent agreement. Sphere left the commons to lay a few more stones before settling in for
    the night. I left to my humble cottage by the wheat fields.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">That night I wrote of the Castle Guards and city officials, making a
    comment that the civil servants of Lord McQuaid were as important to the commoners as
    McQuaid was. I dusted the cheap parchment with lime and dropped it by the pub for all to
    read while they drank their mead.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">When I returned the next morning, a dagger held a fine scroll quite
    plainly over mine to cover it, without quite concealing my text but certainly making a
    statement. I expected a death threat from McQuaid but it bore the Clan's mark of
    &quot;Cryptic Adventurers&quot; and not the Lord. I opened it to find nothing more than a
    notice that he had decorated the Clan Hall. The lack of detail, the placement of the note
    and meaning of the dagger led me to believe that my patronage to Master Sphere and the EQU
    Towers had earned me a threat. Sphere was not pleased.</font></td>
