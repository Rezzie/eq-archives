I just want to thank you for your wonderful <a href="../Issue109/heroes.htm">article in Issue 109</a>.  I
enjoyed reading it, and tears actually sprang to my eyes on that last
line.  As another female playing females, I can empathize.  My primary
character is that of a monk that really wanted to be a cleric.  She tried 
and actually served in the temple for a while, before they told her she 
didn't have any magical ability and wouldn't be allowed to continue her 
training.  She was even rejected from the Paladin Guild for the same reason. 
<br><br>
  Holy orders were all she ever wanted - fortunately for her a wise priest 
at the temple let her know of the Ashen Order early enough for her to join 
and train, and she is satisifed that she is still able to dedicate herself 
to the gods.  But she also has enormous respect for clerics, and would do 
anything for one.  And she too is far too busy serving Quellious to bother 
with romance - something one sometimes has to make clear in a polite way to 
other party members!  I certainly have yet to conceive of an individual that 
would win over her heart!  But true friendship is
something different, and I hope I never lose any companions to the lure of 
an evil woman *laugh*.  I've seen it happen before, but more to casual 
friends than any of my true companions.
<br><br>
Again thank you so much for the wonderful article!

I am very glad you enjoyed it!
<br><br>
If anyone had ever told me Oxes would be able to spark such strong feelings 
in people back when I created her persona, I think I would have called them 
whacko and been agreed with. <g>  Her friendship does run deep and as your 
describe your character, she's been through a rough road but enjoys the 
struggle since it's in service to her Tribunal.
<br><br>
There are two different levels to it that leave a person torn.  On one hand 
it's the sort of Role-play and character interaction I hope everyone gets to 
run into one day just as far as character impact is concerned.  On the other 
hand, yeah it sucks <g>  Of course I choose the path that Oxes is walking 
and while I have really enjoyed it, this was truly something even OOC I 
didn't forsee happening.  I was completely shocked even OOC when I heard 
KAYLER was getting married.  It's sort of like you fall into this belief 
that the realtionship is always going to be the same since they have 
accepted, or remained quiet, how your character reacts to theirs.  It has 
been described to me that trying to show strong feelings of that nature 
towards Oxes is like running into a brick wall.  Your head hurts but the 
wall looks just the same as before.
<br><br>
However I can't help but to think, if I could be so surprised by  events 
even OOC....  what is waiting around the next corner or in the months ahead? 
  That's something I am really looking forward to unfolding in this is tale 
with no playwrite.

What?  No Bard's Log this week?  Why that's... that's... CRIMINAL!
My heart's pounding.  My handdds are shakkkkking.  I think I'd better
go lie down until next Friday when I can get my fix again.  I'll see
you then.

The real world is keeping our pal Sir Maximus busy.  School, finals, stuff like that...  He'll be studying for finals this week as well, so no Bard's Log this week either.  I think we'd all like to see the guy graduate instead of drawing comics just to amuse us.

Right?  :P

Most noble editors of the Express

I find my days travelling wearier now. Weary, not from the lack of good 
hunts, not from the lack of companionship, but from one thing:
<br><br>
Ignorant player names.
<br><br>
In Issue 100 you had a letter from a 'Briza' character. How many people 
know, or even care, that that name is part of the Forgotten Realms universe, 
created by R.A. Salvatore, and is most probably copyrighted?
<br><br>
In-game, I've counted 17 variations of the name "Drizzt".
<br><br>
Examples are "Drizzit" (which Drizzt was called by a child in the book 
Sojourn, again, by R.A. Salvatore), "Drizzzt", "Drizt", et. al.
<br><br>
Also, I have seen about 7 variations of his father's name, "Zaknafein", once 
more, also a name from the Forgotten Realms.
<br><br>
Examples include "Zaknalfein", "Zaknafien", "Zaknafeinn", et. al.
<br><br>
Of course, none of these have been as numerous as the name of one of the 
greatest wizards ever to grace Toril: Elminster. So numerous have I seen the 
copies of his name, in the 8+ servers I have travelled to, I have lost 
count.
<br><br>
Examples: "Eleminster", "Elminister", "Ellminster", et. al.
<br><br>
Now, I have spoken to a Guide on all levels. An Apprentice, a Full Guide, 
and a Game Master have all told me that these names do not violate the 
Naming Policy! I am shocked, appalled, insulted, choose the cliche'.
<br><br>
I would like everyone to know that I will not play with anyone named as 
such. If it is not an original name, I do not know you. I will not help you. 
I encourage all of you to do the same.
<br><br>
End this disaster... these people are insulting the great names invented by 
some of the greatest minds in RPG writing history.
<br><br>

<br><br><br>
<em>Ignorant is a strong word.  I'm as annoyed as anyone by the kinds of names that you described.  But they don't bother me as much as others (you know, Killa, Murda, etc.)  And while they are certainly not creative names, at least they fit the world.  I do have to disagree with you on one point, though.  They are not insulting these names, nor thier creators.  It's a compliment, really.  They insult us, though.  And they certainly do not speak well of the creative abilities of the user.</em>

Absor,
<br><br>
Hey, just wanted to drop a note and say how on the money your
<a href="../Issue109/edita.htm">editorial</a> was. Having done time as an assistant manager in a gas
station and over 2,000 hours fo tech support I too know what it is
like to have the customer be irate.
<br><br>
When people are being nasty to you all the time it's VERY hard to be
patient and nice all the time. I think that the strain has gotten to
Aradun, as his posts seem to be somewhat terse and final. Abashi is
bearing up well under the strain, but I really feel for him and have
a seen a few of his posts that have a frustrated tone.
<br><br>
Realizing that for everyone 1 complement you will get 1000
complainers you can make the best of it. After about 1,500 hours of
tech support I was on the verge of yelling back at the customers.
Then I realized that there was a kernel of wisdom in each complaint.
While you can't do anything that will generate 0 complaints, you can
try to listen to the complaints and turn them into constructive
criticism.
<br><br>
I found that for 99% of the complaints there was a way to phrase it
back to my boss like this, "We could offer a better service if we
...". Then we were able to analyze the complaints from a cost benifit
point of view and come up with improvements. Sometimes there was no
improvement that the company could provide and remain in business. So
we had to adopt a greatest good maxin. I.E. only make changes that
made things better for the largest amount of people and put off
things that only helped one or two people.
<br><br>
That leaves the 1% of complaints that were, in my opinion, from
chronic complainers. There are poeple who have found that by being
nasty you can get goods and services for free or at a discount, or
they are just deeply unhappy poeple with a need to lash out. They
need help and we can only wish them well and hope they get it.
<br><br>
In a game with as many subscribers as everquest there are a lot of
people with a lot of pointless vitriol. Add to that the relative
anonymity of the net and you double, or triple the amount of
nastyness you have to deal with on a given day.
I would be willing to be that most of the abuse that is related to
guides and GM's is the abuse, no doubt, heaped on them all the time.
<br><br>
That fact that a guide or a GM can be nice to ANYONE is a testment to
thier goodness and willingness to help. Granted GM's get paid, but I
would be willing to bet there are a lot of jobs they could get where
people would be a lot nicer to them.
<br><br>
I think it would be nice to encourage people to be nice to the GM's
and guides whenever they can. If you petition, do so in a nice way,
if a GM helps you out, thank them. It's easy really.
