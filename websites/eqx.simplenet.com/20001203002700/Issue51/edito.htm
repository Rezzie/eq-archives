	I had the good fortune to have been able to read Absor's <a href="edita.htm">editorial</a> before it was published.  If you haven't read it, read it now, it's excellent. I would like to follow it up with an open letter to the EQ future players and present beta testing community.
<br><br>

<center><b><u>An open letter to the EverQuest beta testers and future players</b></u></center>
<p style="text-align: justify">

	You are about to enter a new world, along with thousands of others.  As you travel through this world, you will learn more about it: it's creatures, items, areas, and stories.  You will learn the "best" weapons, the "best" spells, and the "best" camping areas.  You will leave the world too, and come out into the real world with a desire to share your stories and observations on the game environment.
<br><br>
	Hopefully, 989 will succeed in creating a world where the classes are balanced in such a way that all are uniquely useful.  This is going to be the work of the beta testers currently playing.  If you, as a beta tester, discover a way to suddenly level your character rapidly, or discover that a certain merchant's goods are mislabeled and you can make money selling his own items back to him, tell 989.  They need to know how and why it happened. Don't run off and allow the game to suffer for fear of "losing" a character that you can't carry into final anyway.
<br><br>
	If you do share your knowledge, do it in-game.  Have your character be a teacher, and let players know generally "how" to do something, but don't give them a step-by-step list.  In one of the early chats, Brad said that there will be a way to store information in the game, though he wasn't specific.  This is still in the works.  Just think how cool it would be for you to have to run around Erudin, trying to find a copy of "Oghma's Flora and Fauna of the Qeynos Hills".
<br><br>
	Make hard in-character decisions.  If you have always pictured your character wielding a sword, don't suddenly switch to an out-of-character two-handed staff because it's a "better" weapon.  Although you know that camping near the goblin camp and waiting for the goblins to spawn, killing them, healing, and waiting for them to spawn again is a fast way to get experience, don't do it.  If the information on a spoiler site can solve a quest for you, don't read it.  Learn it in-game.  Make mistakes with your character.  Buy spells that aren't useful, just so you can use them anyway.
<br><br>
		The price of taking advantage of all the information that will soon be readily available is the loss of your sense of wonder.  In the quest to make the toughest character around, you will lose interest in him/her right away because the game will lose it's ability to surprise you.  Once you know the relative levels of all the monsters and what they drop, you will no longer be playing, you'll be working.  Don't <b>work</b> on your characters, <b>play</b> them.
<br><br>
	Losing your sense of wonder about the game world will take away the reason you are playing the game in the first place.
<br><br>
EverQuest - You're in <b>your</b> world now.  Make the most of it.
