Well, I no longer have a lot of excuses for not writing anything at all about EverQuest in my editorials.  Previously I was under the much misunderstood non-disclosure agreement, and even writing my opinions about EverQuest was difficult without violating that agreement.
<br><br>
But now I am free to ramble on about the game, about my opinions of it, about the people that are making it, and about the community around it.  I'm quite certain that each group mentioned could care less what I have to say.  But I might as well make my feelings known.
<br><br>
I'll start with the important one, the game.
<br><br>
EverQuest is gonna rock.  There is no doubt in my mind that people will love it.  It will steal a lot of players from its competitors.  It will rule the market for a very long time.
<br><br>
If you read the interview we did with ourselves (ain't that some kind of ego!), you may have read that I said something about it not being what I wanted it to be.  And that is also true.  But you have to understand where I came from to understand that comment, so I want to address it here.  I don't want to leave anyone with the wrong impression.
<br><br>
I started playing D&D when I was, um…, about sixteen years old.  I have been reading science fiction and fantasy for longer than that.  I have a very specific view of what roleplaying is.  For me it's getting into character and living life as the character would.  It's telling a story from the view of the character, and having that story unfold for everyone as it goes along.  Even when I used to run games I approached it the same way.  My games were always settings.  I would put the characters in a place where everything was there, tell them what was going on around them, then let them go.  I rarely forced them into "the dungeon".  I never made them follow my plot.  I could usually guess what they would do, and I always made sure that I knew how things would go when they did as expected.  But some of my games never left the tavern.  My players were rarely forced to be a 'party'.
<br><br>
One game I ran I used my own character, Absor, as the starting point of the game.  He was hiring people to investigate the activities of some priests to a god that he didn't like.  He knew that they were opening gates and he wanted them closed.  One of the folks that he was hiring decided that he didn't want the job.  He left.  Absor shrugged and sent the group off.  The character that left the group then went about hiring characters and paying them to stop the group that Absor had hired.  This new group consisted of several characters played by the same players that had characters in the first group.  This second group ambushed the first.  One of them was a very powerful assassin.  He killed, I think, two of the original group before he discovered that one of the original group was a friend of his and let the rest live.  It was a tremendous mess.  And I could have stopped it.  As a GM it was within my ability to make it take just too long for that second group to gather, allowing the first to get off plane and out of reach.  But I didn't.  The story belongs to the players to shape.
<br><br>
Once a friend of mine ran a game where the party heard over and over again about how terrible this one temple was.  We were forced to flee an army, and our escape led us right into that temple.  When we discovered that we were in the front room of the nasty temple, we decided to leave.  There were two exits.  One was a deep and dark doorway that led deeper into the temple.  The other was the front door.  When the GM noticed that we were not going to go in, he had the army catch up to us.  It was waiting outside the front door.  There were obviously more of them than he thought we could handle.  He explained to us that he had put A LOT of work into that dungeon.  But we absolutely refused to go in.  We eventually fought our way past the army, and the GM, to safety.  He never forgave us for that.  But our characters were just not going to go in there.  We wanted to face an enemy that we knew instead of one that we did not.
<br><br>
And I brought that view with me into EverQuest.
<br><br>
I've admitted before, and will do so again now, that my only real on-line multiplayer experience is with Tanarus.  I've played the off line RPGs.  I never once thought of them as RPGs.  To me they were always strategy games.  You just can't interact with them.  Sure, I suppose that you could 'play a role' in them, but you just can't roleplay.  FF7 was a great game, but I will never accept it as a roleplaying game.
<br><br>
Knowing how I feel about roleplaying and my experience with on-line gaming (or lack thereof) you might begin to understand how I might find EverQuest less than I had hoped.  I wanted a game that would closely resemble my pen and paper games.  I wanted free flowing conversation.  I wanted clever and quick thinking to be a useful skill.  I wanted someone to make me laugh by doing something purely outrageous.  I wanted to be challenged to use all of my characters skills in order to survive.  I wanted to be able to dig into a confusing political or social situation and conquer it.  I wanted…  well, I wanted a lot more than anyone could give me in a computer game.
<br><br>
NPCs can't challenge my intellect in EverQuest.  I don't have to trick the Qeynos guards into letting me have an audience with Antonius Bayle.  I can't bribe a guard into telling me who is in charge of the necromancer guild in Ak'Anon.  Admittedly, I didn't need to.  I was able to find the master necromancer on my own, and I don't think Bayle actually exists in Qeynos yet.  But there is, of necessity, a level of complexity missing from the game.  And that's something that I really miss.
<br><br>
And then there is typing.  You can't be nearly as swift or expressive using the keyboard as you can using your voice and gestures, no matter how many words per minute you can crank out.
<br><br>
And there is an evolving story line behind the world of Norrath.  I can't complain about that.  It's not fully formed.  Some of the features that are needed to make it really rock aren't fully implemented.  And all of us are still very busy making sure the game works as it's supposed to.  And strides are being made.  The tales by Ozy in this publication reflect events that are actually taking place in the beta (I hope I'm allowed to tell you all that...).  I see a lot of potential in the way that's coming along.  But, of course, it just can't be as involving as person to person roleplaying.
<br><br>
BUT...
<br><br>
I <b>have</b> seen some folks do some truly outrageous things.  I <b>have</b> laughed more times than I can count while testing.  I <b>have</b> had to use my wits to survive.  While my glibness is only useful on PCs, I <b>have</b> been able to use quick thinking to entertain and baffle.  This game has as much in it as you could honestly expect it to have.  Well, it's what you wanted Ultima Online to be.
<br><br>
Next week I'll let you know what I think about the people making the game.
