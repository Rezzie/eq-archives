Guides don't receive a salary? Hmmm. You make it sound as if they work for free? Can you really tell folks that these guides receive no compensation for their hard work whatsoever? A bit misleading, don't you think? 
Regardless of how they are compensated (if at all), does this automatically garner them extra credit and respect from all 180,000 players of EQ? These are faceless people to me, and if they are required to perform a job, then that is what I expect them to do, nothing more, nothing less. Just as I am required to perform my job. If folks don't like what they do, then they shouldn't do it, not whine about it.

<em>[Ed. - Well, Bert and I had a pretty drawn out e-mail conversation about this.  I'll spare you all of it and give a short response.  Yes.  Because they give up their time to make our game more fun they do deserve our respect.  And they never whined to me about it.  I asked, they told me.  And I'm sorry that you don't get more respect at your job.  :) ]</em>

I just wanted to write and say Hi.  I love EQX and read it every week.  I
especially love the stores by Aklar, Keep 'em coming.
<br><br>
Anyway, keep up the great work...

Hi, nice magazine!
<br><br>
In response to your latest editorial,
<br><br>
What I think is missing from Everquest is in-game support for character  individuality and creativity. There are very few ways to make a character stand out from the crowd: rare items and creative use of /emotes and /says.
<br><br>
Everyone of a given race has the same body type; the different faces are good, but there just aren't enough of them. Except for hard-to-get clothing, there are not enough wardrobe choices to distinguish characters.  Everyone (within a given class) uses the same animated emotes, the same spell effects, the same weapon attack animations.
<br><br>
On a text-based MUD, /emotes and /says are more than enough -- since the whole world is text. On Everquest, you might see a group of people run past you and be gone without a single emote. The only method you have to identify any of them is OOC -- reading the name floating above their head.
<br><br>
What Everquest needs are ways for people to "customize" their characters in ways that have no effect on gameplay. I would love to play a fat elf, or buy a hat with a feather in it, or walk with a limp. I would love to have a parrot on my shoulder, a weatherstained cloak, or a rune of power glowing on my forehead.
<br><br>
What do all of these things have in common? They make other players think about the /character/. They convey, in the visual language required of graphical online RPGs like Everquest, personal information about the character.
<br><br>
I recently sent my level 7 high elf on a perilous trip to Erudin just so I could buy a Apprentice Robe of a different color than everyone else. I'm hoping that at least some people see him and wonder. That wonder is a better roleplay seed than any amount of background history.

<em>To paraphrase Absor - "Send in the crones!"
<br><br>
During beta, and in fact in a recent post on the EQSS board, Absor wrote about how much more immersive EQ could be if there were crones.  Old hags, wandering the streets, hobbling with a cane.  Someone not "perfect".  It would be even better if you could be the crone. Good for you for going to Erudin to get that robe!  That is an excellent source and, as you say, seed, for role-playing.  I hope that players notice and ask you about it.  Anything that can be done to increase the sense of wonder is a plus.
