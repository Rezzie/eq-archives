As a long time pen and paper role-player, and an occasional game master, I was intrigued by a description of a Verant run event in EverQuest.  The description came from a friend of mine that, as I just recently discovered, is a guide, and participated as an NPC in the event.  There were several interesting things that this guide mentioned in his re-telling of the event that got me thinking about what, exactly, does it take to make an event work in EverQuest, and how does that compare to how they work in the pen and paper role-playing world.  I think such insight could be useful to players that have little or no pen and paper experience, or to those that have pen and paper experience but have never run a game themselves.  And, most likely, I'll try to offer some suggestions to the quest folks at Verant.
<br><br>
I do not want to imply that I heard a bunch of negative stuff about this particular event.  In fact, the opposite is true.  It seemed to be a very good, well run quest.  I was impressed.  The only real problem that I had was the rigidity of the whole thing.  There was not enough designed flexibility in the course of the events, nor in the result.  The quest <em>could not fail</em> on any server.  These made for some serious problems when it came to times when the players were not up to the task, for whatever reason.  It really hurts an adventure if the players can't fail, and especially so if that fact becomes obvious to them over the course of the adventure.  If an NPC must die for the quest to be successful, and the PCs just can't kill it, then the NPC must, effectively, kill itself.  The players will pick up on that, and the value of their accomplishments is reduced.  A valiant and truthful failure is better than a pre-programmed success.  This is a problem with the philosophy that all servers must be equal.  It is something that the quest designer must take into account at all turns, and I think it truly messes up an event.  I'll talk more about this later, though.
<br><br>
First I need to cover some quick terminology.  I use the word 'event' to talk about an organized happening in the world with live people playing the parts of NPCs.  Basically I use it the same way Verant use the term 'dynamic quest'.  I'm just not comfortable with the word quest because it's far too limiting.  It really sounds like a 'go fetch' kind of thing.  I prefer <em>event</em> because it sounds more inclusive.  A wedding can be an event, as could an auction.  But since there is no need for Verant to run those kinds of things, unless an avatar wants to bless the wedding or something, I'm not going to be talking about those kinds of things anyhow.  I just wanted you to understand what I mean when I say <em>event</em>.
<br><br>
In years long past I attended game conventions.  These game conventions, for me anyway, focused around tournament role-playing.  This is a very self-contradictory way of role-playing.  With the basic role-playing tournament game each group was run through the same game, they were scored based on what they accomplished, and the ones with the highest scores would be invited to play in the second round of games the next day.  A third round would determine the winning group.  This is role-playing with winners and losers…  or, in my vocabulary, it's <b>not</b>-role-playing.  However, there are useful parallels with events in EverQuest, and examining the structure of these tournament games can lead to some insight into running events in Norrath.
<br><br>
A role-playing adventure is written in much the same way that a story is written.  It has a beginning, a middle and an end.  Have you ever tried one of those little adventure books (or web sites) where you read a description of your surroundings and you're given a selection of things to do?  You chose one, turn to the page indicated and discover your fate.  You then choose another option.  This goes on until you die or you finish the book.  If you start over and make different choices the path will be different, and often so will the ending.  That's really how you have to approach adventure design.  I say design, because running it is a completely different beast, and I'll talk about that later.  Here are the key elements, as I see them, to designing the structure of an adventure.
<br><br>
<b>Time:</b>  How long will the game last.  This is a very important item to keep in mind when designing the game.  Most tournament roleplaying games last four to eight hours.  If the game realistically takes ten hours to play through, then your players will feel cheated when they can't complete the adventure.  This applies to EverQuest events as well.  How long do you expect your players to be on-line for this quest?  How long to you expect your GMs and Guides to be on to run it?  And you really need to make the players (not the characters, the players) aware of the length of the adventure before they start out.  It's not good when the key character has to log off to go to work half way through, not good for the adventure or for the players.
<br><br>
<b>Number of Players:</b>  The number of players in tournament role-playing is usually six to eight.  The static number of players in the tournament role-playing situation makes it easy to determine the next two items when making your game.  You need to know the number, level and 'alignment' of the characters so that the game will make sense for them and be a challenge, without being too deadly.  In EverQuest this is probably the hardest thing to control, and it's here that a big problem can occur.  But when designing the event you must decide how many characters you want to be involved (and work out how to keep it at that number).  If you want fifty people defending Kelethin from an invasion, great.  If you want four thieves sneaking into Kelethin to provide intelligence for an upcoming invasion, also great.  But decide this now, so that the scope and challenge of the game can be built to match.
<br><br>
<b>Power of Characters:</b>  Part of the same consideration above about the number of characters.  You really need to decide from the start how much force the PCs can bring to bear on your game, and what kind of tricks they can pull.  The 'power' of a character is more than just his level.  You also have to consider his items and the intellect of the player.  A character that can read minds will really screw up a mystery style game.  And a really smart player can raise the effective level of a character by using the character's tools well.  Inversely, an under-equipped character will bring fewer tools to the table and therefore be weaker.  A very new player, even with a very strong character, will be at a disadvantage.  All of this needs to be taken into account, and a 'level' must be set for the game so that you can make it a challenge for all.
<br><br>
<b>Alignment:</b>  Match the adventure to the characters, and visa versa.  Decide from the beginning if the characters need to be good, bad, indifferent or any.  Don't send a bunch of paladins to destroy a church of life.  And don't expect a bunch of thieves to rescue someone out of the kindness of their heart.  There is nothing wrong with telling the player (or character) that he is not going to be allowed to play in this game with this character because the guy hiring for the job is not going to like you.  DO NOT fudge and let your NPC paladin hire a PC shadowknight just because the player begs.  Then you have to make up some reason why this was done, and it becomes a mess.  Just don't do it.  Yes, there are plenty of adventure designs that will allow any character type to play.  Some of the most entertaining ones will include a very diverse party.  And if you want that, then make sure to keep it in mind at all times while designing the game.  Add moral conflict and let them figure out right from wrong.  But with a diverse group you must have a <b>very</b> strong reason for them to stay together.  And diversity like that can weaken the party, so if you are expecting the group to be lees than efficient due to amusing personality conflicts, make sure the power of the game considers this.
<br><br>
<b>Goal:</b>  Not only do the adventurers need a goal to strive for, but so does the adventure itself.  Are you trying to give the party a sense of abject terror, making them happy to just get out alive?  Are you trying to give them a light and funny adventure that will make them chuckle at work the next day?  Are you trying to create an epic adventure that will be remembered in the history of the game world?  Decide that early and keep it in mind the whole time you are designing and running the adventure.  And make sure that all GMs and NPCs know this goal.
<br><br>
That's all the pre-planning.  The rest is very much story writing.  The only thing that you have to keep in mind is that the characters in your adventure will be completely independent beings.  They will think of a hundred things that you never imagined.  They will try all of them, too.  They will go left when you figured they had to go right.  Make your adventure as flexible as possible.  When you are dealing with people playing NPCs, don't give them lines, give them motivation.  Suggest patterns of speech, tell them what information should be easy to get, and what should be hard.  If at all possible, give them a detailed history for their character.  But let them be flexible.  If they have to modify the adventure on the fly, then all the better.  There is nothing more thrilling to a player then to outthink a smart NPC.  There is nothing less interesting than to poke the NPC until it barfs up it's programmed lines.  This is THE essence of the 'dynamic' over the 'static' quests in EverQuest.
<br><br>
As for the story itself, please, please make sure that you include all of the normal plot elements.  Have a beginning, a middle and an end.  Pace it properly.  Find good protagonists and good antagonists.  Do all the good writer stuff to the adventure.  But also keep in mind that you are not so much writing a story, as you are writing a setting.  I am currently reading a book called <em>How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy</em> by one of my favorite authors, Orson Scott Card.  One of the first things he does, after explaining what exactly is and is not science fiction and fantasy, is to tell us that the first step in writing speculative fiction is to create the world in which it will take place.  Because, by definition, science fiction and fantasy takes place in a setting that can't exist, describing that setting is important.  In the case of writing a game, or an event for EverQuest, the setting really is all that you need.  Writing anything more than that tends to set the story in stone and stifle the game, which should be driven by the players, not the game writer.
<br><br>
I know I just told you to pace the game properly and to write a beginning, middle and end, and then told you that you should write the whole story, but just the setting...
<br><br>
I'm not completely mad.  Trust me on that.
<br><br>
What you need to do is have all the setting elements needed for the beginning, middle and end written out completely.  All of the characters, all of the places, all of the 'stuff', need to be ready when the game starts.  The story part, the action, will be written as the players enter into each setting.  If you have the setting ready for them, they will be able to travel about in the story in any direction they feel like, and the story will go on.
<br><br>
I am very much an analogy and example person.  There is no way I'm going to be able to continue this article without an example.  So let's make it a very simple one.  Let's use the idea that four rogues sneak into Kelethin in order to gain information for an invasion.  Let's make it a very simple thing, gather a report from an inside agent and return back to Neriak with this information.  In exchange they are promised a grand reward.
<br><br>
The scene for the start of this adventure will need to include:
<br><br>
The Champion of Hate that is expected to lead the invasion, and his background and motivation.<br>
His method of hiring the spies.<br>
The location for his interview with the spies.
<br><br>
Not too tough.  Let's say that the Champion thinks that this upcoming invasion is doomed to failure.  He knows that he was given the dubious honor of leading this mission by a family with a lot of power in Neriak.  A family that hates him (in good Dark Elf fashion) for things that he did long ago.  This Champion, however, will not allow them to beat him.  He will not dishonor himself by showing weakness.  He will not ever admit that he thinks that this is a setup.  And he will never lay blame for it.  Doing so would be to admit that he was aware of their machinations and, assuming he survives, would give them a hint that he knows who to revenge himself on.  Besides, if he actually succeeds he'll be a hero, and he'll have the power to order the execution of his enemies.
<br><br>
But, being a Champion of Hate (by the way, this is my lingo for a Dark Elf shadowknights) he knows no spies.  His contacts are with the necromancers and the Indigo Brotherhood.  He knows no thieves.  So he will just have to find one, use his cunning mind to discern his or her potential loyalty, and have that person pick a few others for the mission.  This <b>must</b> be done in complete secrecy.  He will make sure that the chosen spy knows the danger he puts himself in if he decides to talk about this job.  He wants four spies.  He wants them to be of a power level to defeat a single Wood Elf guard, if needed, and they must be very skilled at sneaking about (this might include anyone that can prove that he can travel among Wood Elves unnoticed, not just rogues).  Oh, and he's not telling them anything beyond what their job is.  They don't need to know anything about the upcoming invasion, or his part in it.  They just need to get the information and bring it to him.
<br><br>
He knows the barkeep at the Blind Fish, and feels safe holding a meeting like this there, and not too many other places in Neriak.  He will tell the spies that they are to get a letter from a patron of one of the taverns of the city, and tells them his name.  This inside man will be at one of the taverns in the city every day from noon until three o'clock.  The Champion needs this information within three days.
<br><br>
The middle scene is, well, all of Kelethin.  The nice thing with EverQuest is that we have all that background set up already.  The city is there, its people are there, and some interesting PCs will likely be there too.  No need to script anything out at all, except for the informant.  The informant hates his job.  He thought that it would eventually lead to a political assassination, or at least something interesting.  All he's been doing for the last three months is tracking the coming and going of guards.  He's a bit upset, and has taken to drinking a lot while waiting every stinking day at the meeting place for a contact that just never comes.  He's bitter.  And he'll be willing to take it out on the first spy that dares to treat him with anything but the utmost respect.  He might even threaten to turn them over to the guards, though doing so would likely get him killed too.  He'll ask for his wages from the PCs before turning in his report.  He's upset that he's been forced to actually work in this city in order to survive, and he thinks his salary is long overdue.  The information that the characters are to retrieve is not on him.  He'll have to go get it.  It's a diary, written in Old Erudin to keep it safe from Elvish spies (if one of the PCs actually knows the language, then he'll be able to read it - write up something interesting).
<br><br>
And the end scene is the player characters returning to Neriak and trying to find the Champion.  Let's have him in a meeting in the Blind Fish with some agents of his upcoming invasion.  They are waiting impatiently for the information that the PCs bring, and may be chatting a bit about troop strengths and such, to give the PCs a chance to learn that something big is coming up (and hopefully the invasion really will occur as an event directly after this one).  He will reward them with something appropriate to their level.  He will then head out to discuss the invasion in his private quarters.
<br><br>
Obviously there is more to be written to set the scenes.  But I wouldn't include any dialogue.  That's up to the person playing the NPCs.
<br><br>
I've got a LOT more to say about this sort of thing, but I'm only going to touch on one more point, and save the rest for another article.  What if they don't succeed?  What if they can't really get into Kelethin?  What if they can't do it in the time given?  How about we add an element to the scene.  Not only does the Champion send them to gather the information, he also tells them that they are to kill the inside agent once they have the information.  AFTER they have the information... the information is the most important thing to the Champion.
<br><br>
This makes the whole thing a lot more complicated.  If I'm running this game, I don't tell the person playing the inside agent that the PCs are going to try to kill him.  I leave it up to all the people involved to work that out.  So now the PCs must find a way to isolate him (he is, after all, a Wood Elf, and the guards will defend him) and kill him after they get the diary.  If they kill him first they won't find the diary, it's not on him.  All sorts of things could go wrong.
<br><br>
Killing the agent is not really important to the Champion.  He would feel safer if that agent wasn't around anymore, but it's not critical to him.  How he reacts to failure will be completely dependent on how the PCs act, and what they tell him.  If they lie well enough, they will probably be rewarded (he can't tell if they are lying...).  It's all up to the person playing the Champion.  He should NOT communicate with the agent until it's over, he should allow the PCs to determine what he thinks.  Though if the agent finds that he was attacked and decides to head to Neriak to find out why...
<br><br>
As long as all of the players in this story know their roles well enough, and the scenes are set well enough, all we need is for the pieces to be in place.  Once set up, the story should play itself out.  And it should do so all on it's own.  So what if the reward in this case was, say, a unique stiletto for each spy?  If those weapons don't happen to be rewarded on half of the servers because the party failed, then that makes the success for some all the sweeter.  Keep those stilettos on a list of rewards for some other quest, maybe during the invasion.  But don't force the Champion to give them to the PCs, even if they return empty-handed.  And don't force the agent to give up the diary and roll over and die.  Let the person playing him be as smart as he can about his own life.  If he's smart enough to not want to be alone with a bunch of rogues sent by a dangerous shadowknight, or if he's skillful enough to get away from them, then let escape be his reward.  And use that agent in the upcoming invasion.  If he knows the Champion tried to kill him, let him fight for Kelethin.  If not, maybe he'll sneak up on some key defenders and make the invasion easier from the inside...
<br><br>
I am encouraged by what I hear of the quests that have been happening lately in Norrath.  Keep up the great work!
