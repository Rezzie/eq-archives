Once you have thoroughly examined your character concept, you will have a good sense of who they are, and who they will be.  You probably have images in your head of scenes that are likely scenarios for your character, and situations in which they would excel.  You now want to tell others about this individual, and how they got to the place when you assumed control of their lives and began playing them.  A poorly written/designed biography will never show how fascinating that character is, but clearly indicate the education level of the writer.  Here are some basic tips to avoid having your writing style get in the way of telling your story.

<b>Spelling</b>
<br><br>
Use a spell-checker.  Use a spell-checker. Use a spell-checker.  There is nothing which will interrupt a well-told story more than consistently bad spelling.  There are guild pages out there currently that look like there were written by 3rd-graders, with character biographies with excellent ideas which I gave up on after the first paragraph,  Not everyone is a perfect speller, but most word-processing software has a decent spell-checker installed.  This can also help if you lose track of how to spell words which will never be in a spell-checker, like Norrath or your character’s name.  While writing a dwarven myth recently, I noticed that I had spelled the main character’s name three different ways.  Ooops!  Thank goodness, my spell-checker caught it.

<b>Homonyms</b>
<br><br>
Words that sound alike are frequently spelled correctly but used improperly.  Here are the most frequent mistakes I have seen when reading character biographies. (I make them myself too, especially on IRC)
<br><br>
There (a location), Their (the possessive of they), and They’re (the contraction of they are).
<br><br>
Your (the possessive of you), and You’re (the contraction of you are)
<br><br>
Here (a location), and hear (to perceive a sound).
