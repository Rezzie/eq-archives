Well, when pressed for ideas about what to write, I usually fall back on writing about my weekly games or some such thing.  Well this week I get a reprieve.  The following letter arrived to help me out.  It's always nice when a reader lends me a hand.
<br><br>
<em>Unlike any other emails I've sent, this is not a reply but a new topic.  Before I start, I wanted to thank you for writing about the guides in this game. Unlike the GMs (well, some of them) they have been shown to me to work without bias and in a friendly manner. And now...
<br><br>
I am a regular reader/poster on the Druid's Grove. A current topic that has recently turned my stomach is the concept of "Exploitation." This is of course the big offense that can have your account removed. It costs you whatever you paid for the game. While this is just wrong, it is not why I write...
<br><br>
I write this because I see the absolutely horrid response to these "Exploits" by players. Instead of petitioning Verant to fix the pathing, they instead petition to have the player banned. I seem to be alone on this, with very few exceptions, in the druid community. Instead of fixing the pothole in the road, we arrest everyone who sees it. Does this make any sense at all? It would seem 99% (with the remaining 1% liking the bug) of the players would like the bug fixed. Yet instead of doing this, they continue the exploit by just removing those who find it. This seems very disturbing. 
<br><br>
Might even make a good editorial :)

It sure will make a good editorial.  Especially since I don't agree with your point.  Well, I agree with you about the guides, but not about exploits.
<br><br>
Your analogy doesn't work.  You are comparing looking at a problem (the pothole) to abusing the problem (the pathing).  Let's start this editorial with a better analogy.  Hmm...  how about smoking pot.  A lot of people think that smoking marijuana is a completely acceptable thing to do, with or without a prescription.  It is, however, illegal.
<br><br>
A much better analogy.  The first thing you need to understand is that abusing a pathing bug is against the rules of the game.  And to exist in the society that is EverQuest you need to abide by the rules, regardless of your feelings about those rules.  Break those rules and you should be prepared to accept the consequences.  Jail time for smoking, loss of your account for exploiting.
<br><br>
And just like real life, you get plenty of warning.  You will never be banned for any first offense.  You get, as far as I know, three strikes.  So nobody can claim ignorance of the rules.  You know that if you find a place where the monster should reach you, but fails to do so because of some bug in the geometry, you should <b>not</b> use that spot to kill monsters at no risk to yourself.  People that have been banned for doing it knew that it was wrong because they were warned about it, more than once.
<br><br>
There really is no excuse for exploiting a pathing bug.
<br><br>
And I see no reason to be mad at someone for reporting such an exploit.  Let's go back to our example.  Let's say that you and I are walking down the street discussing EverQuest (what else would we talk about, we don't even know each other).  We see someone on a park bench smoking an illegal substance.  You think that the laws that make such a substance illegal are wrong.  I think that they are right and just laws.  So I call the cops.
<br><br>
Now maybe you think I'm wrong because I am helping to enforce a law that you don't think is just.  But you are an adult.  You recognize a few things about me.  First you know that I have the right and duty to aid society.  You are aware that your society, through votes of the majority - either for the specific law or for the people that approved that law, have decided that this substance should not be used.  You, as a rational being, accept that my call to the police is the correct thing for me to do, even if you would never do it yourself.
<br><br>
You certainly could disagree with me.  You certainly could argue with me and try to change my mind.  But if you are a truly rational person, you can't really be angry with me, because I am following my conscience.
<br><br>
No, the guy isn't hurting me with his exploiting.  Yes, Verant should fix the bug.  Yes, I should /bug the location of the pathing problem.  But those are completely separate issues.  The person exploiting a pathing bug knows very well that he is breaking the rules.  He knows what happens if he get caught.  The last time you ran a red light, you knew you were breaking the rules.  You knew you could get a costly ticket for it.  And you might be upset that it happened.  But are you really angry at the cop for pulling you over?
<br><br>
I hope not.
<br><br>
Oh, and yes, we do elect Verant to create rules for us in much the same way that we choose our politicians.  We vote with our monthly subscription.
