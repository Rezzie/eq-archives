<big><big>A</big></big> great way to make a character interesting and fun to play is to give that character a personal quirk or a peculiar characteristic.  Maybe your character speaks with a lisp, is an incurable drunk, or an incorrigible prankster.  Or maybe he is hard of hearing, is insatiably curious, or just really stupid.  It's often good to keep in mind the environment when considering what kind of quirk to give your character.  A real life person probably wouldn't be allergic to magic, or have a fear of orcs, or be addled because he took one too many club blows to the noggin; but it would be perfectly natural for a barbarian from northern Antonica to possess any or all of these afflictions.  "Why would I want to give my character such a drawback?" you may ask.  Well, for one thing it's a roleplaying challenge.  If you are more concerned with gaining wealth and building up levels than you are with roleplaying, then you might not be attracted to this option.  However, all the really memorable characters that I've met on ORPGS have had some sort of defining flaw or characteristic.  For instance, I once met a half-elf with multiple personality disorder.  This guy was roleplayed so well that I'll probably never forget him.  Sure, there were lots of people I knew who were more powerful, had more magical items, knew more spells... but everybody in the entire realm was trying to collect power and magical items, it doesn't make you any different from anybody else if you reach level 18, or that you have picked up a longsword +3.  If you want to create a truly memorable character, one that people remember for a long time after you're gone, roleplaying around a certain negative characteristic is one of the best ways to go about it.  Sure it might make things a little bit tougher if your ogre is as dumb as a stump, but overcoming adversity given the weaknesses and limitations of your character is the very essence of roleplaying.</td>

Many folks are reluctant to roleplay for fear of being rude to somebody.  If you're a pugnacious little elf-hating dwarf, and an elf with absolutely no concept of roleplaying approaches you and asks to join you, you're faced with the dilemma of either being rude or suspending your character's personality for a little while.  My advice is use your judgment, if you don't want to be rude then keep that in mind when you create the character.  Otherwise, don't feel bad if roleplaying your character entails being rude to somebody.  The dwarf in the above example would be perfectly justified in giving a response like, "Off wit'cha ya elfling, 'fore I cleave yer pointy li'l ear off!"  The elf with no concept of roleplaying might be confused by this since to his knowledge his ears are perfectly rounded; so he gets a quick lesson in roleplaying.  A very important thing to remember when roleplaying is that a character's personality is not just a hat to be put on and taken off whenever you please.  If you are going to roleplay a character, be consistent!  There are times when being a really stupid ogre would put you into an embarrassing situation, and when being a pugnacious dwarf will get you into trouble; these are not times to abandon your character's personality.  A good roleplayer is playing a character, like in a book, sort of telling the story of this character as he plays.  Naturally, the character will sometimes get into trouble just for being himself, this is just another page in the story of this character.  What if Robin Hood stopped being Robin Hood if his action might get him arrested by the Sheriff of Nottingham?  Robin Hood would be a very boring book.</td>

Some people will try to roleplay evil characters by indiscriminately killing.  Allow me to stress that this is not roleplaying.  'Evil' does not mean 'homicidal sociopath'.  If you would like to roleplay an evil character, consider one who is cold and calculating, manipulative and treacherous; but not necessarily a rampant killer.  Then again, many people like to play vicious thugs.  That's not so bad as long as you try to roleplay in a way that is controlled and respectful of your fellow players.  Roleplaying violent characters is tricky business because it's quite easy to go from roleplaying a violent person to just being a jerk who does nothing but ruin the game for everybody else he comes into contact with.  Naturally, a balance should be struck.  On one hand, characters should have a lot of leeway to roleplay however they want.  Besides, Norrath is not a world of peaches and cream where everybody is nice to everybody else and brutality is just the way things work out on many occasions.  On the other hand, EverQuest is a game which people play for enjoyment, and killing others just for the heck of it is clearly a detriment to the enjoyment of the one being killed.  To some extent, the PK switch should alleviate such tensions; however it is yet to be seen how much this will help, so I won't get into a discussion about that here.  I would say roleplay however you like, but always try to respect the other players.  Even though your elf character might not respect another person's dwarf character, you as a player should still respect the player of that other character.  What this translates to is a line, within which roleplaying is in good taste.  A well roleplayed racial jibe between a dwarf and an elf is not crossing the line in my opinion; actively seeking out newbies to kill without even a word of explanation is definitely beyond the line of good taste, and shows no respect for your fellow player.
