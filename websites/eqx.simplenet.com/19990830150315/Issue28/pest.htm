David often visited Electronics Boutique when his mom took him to the mall with her.  He loved checking out the new titles.  Today David noticed that a new game had been released for the PC.  He grabbed the box from the shelf.  "EverQuest" was the name of the new title.  He read the requirements and decided he wanted to purchase the game.  When his mom returned with her purchases, David begged her to buy the game for him.  His mother often thought it better to accommodate David rather than listen to his constant whining, so she bought it.  Once David got home he installed the new game.  His mother gave him a credit card number to use for the registration.  Within minutes David was online and playing the game.  
<br><br>
First off David noticed that others where running around in the city, where the game had placed him.  David runs up to one of the groups of citizens.  
<br><br>
<em>"Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?"</em> he types over and over to the screen.<br>
<em>"Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?"</em><br>
<em>"Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?"</em><br>
<em>"Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  Can you help me?"</em>
<br><br>
The people he questioned try hard to ignore him.  
<br><br>
<em>"I want some help."</em> he shouted repeatedly.<br>
<em>"I want some help."</em> he shouted repeatedly.<br>
<em>"I want some help."</em> he shouted repeatedly.<br>
<em>"I want some help."</em> he shouted repeatedly.
<br><br>
A passing traveler gives him some coins.  David takes them, and then starts to follow the traveler.  
<br><br>
<em>"Hey ho do I get stuff  yo get?"</em> David asked.
<br><br>
<em>"You buy it, or find it on MOBS that you kill."</em> The adventure says, moving away from David, joining up with his friend.  
<br><br>
Together, the two men continue out of town.  Both of the men are obviously seasoned fighters.  David follows them, asking questions the entire time.  The men tell David that it's dangerous where they are going.  David continues to follow, ignoring their warnings.  After a few minutes of travel, one of the fighters appears to be getting annoyed by David's presence, and constant rambling.  
<br><br>
<em>"Hey get lost.  We have things to do, and you're getting on my nerves."</em> The large fighter growls at David.
<br><br>
<em>"Bite me you retard"</em> David retaliates.
<br><br>
David begins to taunt the two men, a mixture of obscenities, nagging, and whining.  The fighter growing very tired of this draws his sword.
<br><br>
<em>"Get out of here before I <u>behead</u> you."</em> He says, as spit erupts from his mouth.
<br><br>
David continues to taunt the two.  The fighter draws back his sword and with all his might, and then swings the sword downward at David.  The fighter is presented a message suddenly on his screen.  
<br><br>
<em><u>"You feel too peaceful to perform this action."</u></em>
<br><br>
The fighter hangs his head low and crawls away.

This is the last words a warrior of the renaissance period wants to hear as he is about to pound his easy mark.  These were tough times.  Death occurred at every corner.   How many times do you think a magical force held a thief from looting a victim's dead corpse?  Travel was only accomplished in numbers.   Can you imagine a small framed newbie dwarf sitting next to a three hundred-pound fighter, who has fought for years, and demand him to pay for his ale?  NO!  The fighter would smash him where he sat, not missing a drink of his brew.

These are the types of MUDS I play.  When a high level mage came near me I would panic.  OH MY GOD, please don't kill me.  You dare not breathe in their direction for fear they would vaporize you.  At one time I think we had almost four hundred people playing that mud.  Player vs Player was allowed, but not abused.  When a player was killed, all the in-game gods and designated police were notified of it.   You might even get a friendly;
<br><br>
"You ok?"
<br><br>
We let the players control the game.  When you reach a certain level you were given the opportunity to become a member of the in-game police force.  PVP was permitted but rarely abused.  No player with a high level character wanted to risk loosing him by a purge for abusing his privileges.  Just as most people do not murder.  They don't want to spend the rest of their life in prison.  Pkilling was reserved for looters, or another annoying player types.  It was not used for robbing weak players.  Naughty players would often be put in what we called "HELL" or the "Void".  You could spend weeks in hell.  To play during that time, you needed to create another character, or just not play during your sentence.    If a player continued to repeat the offence he would be deleted.  True an Ultima Online or EverQuest would have more trouble accomplishing this because of the mass numbers, but I believe it would still work.  There would just be larger police forces.  Obviously it would need to be tested.  I may be wrong.  It might never work.  But at least it should be given a chance. 
<br><br>
I think a large online gaming company could accommodate both environments.   I would like to see just as many servers dedicated to PVP switch setup for Police enforced.  These servers would allow PVP.  "I" as a paying customer, would like an opportunity to play in both environments, but not both environments in one game.  To me this would be a nuisance.  
<br><br>
No matter what the system though, I am very excited about the upcoming release of EQ.  I think they have created the perfect MUD we have all been waiting for, and we are going to have a blast, lose a lot of sleep, while playing it.
