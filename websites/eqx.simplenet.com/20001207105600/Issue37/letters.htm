<em>This letter refers to an article by Oghma, titled
<a href="../Issue36/paladin.htm">The Paladin</a> from Issue 36.</em>
<br><br>

Excellent article, well written and thought out.  Had quite a bit of
information that I did not know.
<br><br>
Just for the record the Ranger has quite a story in mythos and history as
well.

I just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed the story <a href="../Issue36/dark.htm">'Dark
Nights'</a> featured in the latest issue of EQX (36). Will there be any more
stories featuring Trynlor in the next issue?

Thank you for your interest in my story Dark Nights. I think you've 
just inspired me to write more stories (though I did not plan on it) 
for EQX. Keep an eye out for more stories in the future.
