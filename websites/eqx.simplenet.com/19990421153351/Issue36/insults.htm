Hi, I'm Archanalia the Roleplayer.  You may know me from such characters as "Mizzrak the Maloderous Troll" and "Qestrin, assassin of souls".
<br><br>
While Archanalia may be well known for his inability to resist a sick joke and his casual demeanor, Mizzrak and Pun-Chi are less amiable.  But then you wouldn't know this unless you could connect all three together and could see that I am, in fact, NONE of these three.  That's right; none of these characters, good or bad, are in fact like me.  Now THAT's Roleplaying!
<br><br>
But how could you tell?  The simple answer is that if I am doing my roleplaying well, then you couldn't!
<br><br>
Now in the course of roleplaying you are bound to come across circumstances under which you will break character.  It's inevitable.  And especially in a beta, where you will need to compare notes with one another about occurrences that may or may not be bugs in the software.  But in a smooth running, well structured roleplaying game, characters should be seamless and should be able to bound through events in character.
<br><br>
Some people, me included, have a problem with playing parts that may reflect badly on them.  Primarily I speak of malevolent, slanderous, ill-behaved characters.  Most of us like to be liked.  That makes it hard to come into a situation where you want to make friends (such as an online game) and insult those around you.
<br><br>
What you'll often see in online games is something like  "You suck!  ;-) ", the little wink at the end meant to denote that you aren't really serious.  In an RPG you need to step this up to the next level.  First off, "suck" would not necessarily be the best language for a fantasy RPG.  Next error was in trying to denote that perhaps you are kidding.
<br><br>
First thing I would suggest is that if you are insulted during a game that you do not take the comment too seriously.  After all, this is a game.
<br><br>
Next, it's important that any response you have be in character.  Accept the insult, no matter what it may be, as if the character you were playing were being insulted.  If you are playing a first level wizard and you are insulted by a couple of highly muscled, well armed thieves then perhaps you shouldn't mouth off to them, unless that's really part of his character.  YOU might insult such individuals, but would your character?
<br><br>
Finally, if you are the type to insult someone in game, or just to return an insult, it's important that it be done in game context.  Trust me when I say that this will increase the enjoyment of the game for the person you are insulting, and if he were insulting you out-of-character, such as with a pithy phrase like "You @$$hole!", insulting them in game context still shows that you won't sink that low, and that you UNDERSTAND that it's just a game, regardless of what they might think.
<br><br>
Now here's a quick quiz!  See if you can spot the insults that are made by characters and the ones that are made by players who have slipped out of character…
<br><br>
"You have the stench and manners of a rabid Troll!"<br>
"You moron, that's my loot!  That shit should be illegal!"<br>
"If my children had faces like yours, I'd sell them to Orcs to raise!"<br>
"What the f*** are you doing you piece of s***!"<br>
"Go flagellate yourself, you simpering hogwife!"<br>
"dOOd u sux like a biatch!"
<br><br>
Now I know that some of these I would be rather repulsed by as a logical game-playing individual, and others would simply make me laugh.  Now in each case, my character would have a different response from what mine would be.
<br><br>
Here are some comebacks from my characters to such phrases (in their respective order to what is above):<br>
Mizzrak:  "Uh…. Miz is Troll.  Miz not rabbit!" [swings with his club]<br>
Qestrin:  "Funny, it seems to be in MY pockets!"<br>
Archanalia:  "Yes, it's good to keep children within the family lineage."<br>
Mizzrak:  "Miz not like tone of voice.  Miz not like you now." [swings with his club]<br>
Qestrin:  "Met my wife have you?"<br>
Archanalia:  "Obviously there is no intelligence test to be a thief.  I must talk to your guildmaster about his standards."
<br><br>
To recap, when encountering insulting individuals, don't take what they say too seriously.  Most importantly, don't let them draw you out of character.  It's hard for everyone else to roleplay when two individuals have dropped out of character and are disturbing the game.  If you need to speak to someone in a language which doesn't befit the game, do it in private chat of some type, not on open channels where you will ruin the enjoyment of others.
