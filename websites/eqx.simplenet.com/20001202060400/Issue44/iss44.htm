We have another one.  The shot is of what appears to be a fight between two groups 
of player characters.  Aradune is in it, and so is that now famous flaming sword.  
Take a look.

Our 46th Issue will be coming out on October 31st.
<font color="#ff6600"><b>HALLOWEEN!</b></font>  So we have decided to dedicate
that issue to tales of horror from Norrath.  If you have any terrifying stories
to tell, articles about the dead, or any artwork 
suitable to frighten, send them in!  Please try to get them in before the 29th, so that 
we'll have time to review them before publication.

This was the last place he wanted to be, on the last day he could possibly match it with. He could not be late.  On pain of death, he could not be late. Rain fell about him and on him as Rath hurried through the dark forest. All the past two days he had been moving through this cursed wood of gnarled trees with the smell of death and decay hammering his senses. It would never end, he told himself repeatedly, though he continued to place one weary, heavily sodden boot in front of the other. He looked up, trying to see any sweet sign of the golden orb. None was visible; the sky was thick with iron-black clouds and streaking lightning.

While we wait for EverQuest to reach open beta, we at EverQuest Express like
to pretend we are already playing the game.  Here we offer a humorous look
at what our staff could be doing if this were true.  Watch this space, as a 
new staff member will be featured each week.

Something was wrong.
<br><br>
Call it a feeling, or a hunch, or whatever you may, but something felt 
out of place. Beldro could feel it in the core of his stomach. This had 
been too easy. The whole setup was wrong. As days went, he was not 
having a good one. First captured by these peasants, and then subjected 
to an assault from a small number of Dark Elves, lead by Priestess of Innoruk. Still, reviewing what went wrong was the best way to 
figure out how to do right, regardless of what Zass said about the past.

If you were given the chance to create a character for a game, any character at all, what would you create?  That was the opportunity we were given last weekend.  Characters could be from any world, as long as it was not one that we were already using for a campaign<b>...</b>

Well, it's good to be back.  I took a few weeks off EverQuest, due to family guests and a nagging cold that has been hanging around for a few weeks, and boy, it was nice to not have to eat, sleep, and think EverQuest for a little while.

The different areas in EQ, they seem to have been added just so they would have one of each (jungle, Mts etc)  Do these need a history? (I think each region should have its own past..) Are the players up to it(making up the history, if brad and his 'crew' does not)? can they add more to the region then just its name and thats its a jungle with temples in it, etc...? In other words...make this one about role-playing, particularly about regions :)</em>
