Silak drew his cowl up above his face in an attempt to keep out the chill that was seeping into his bones. He looked to the moon in the sky to gauge the time. The time was growing nearer. Silak yawned, the chill making him sluggish. In doing so he revealed row after row of sharp pointed teeth made for tearing flesh to shreds. A sickly pink tongue rolled out of his mouth and down his chin. The moonlight shimmered off the green scales covering his face. Among his race Silak was considered very handsome. The hue of his scales started out light green at the tip of his nose and grew deeper in color as they moved down his neck. His tale was tipped in a deep shade of midnight blue. Silak was very proud of his scales and spent hours each day making sure each one was perfectly aligned, removing every dead scale on his body every morning. This night, however, most of his body was obscured by the heavy gray robe of his station. Silak was a necromancer in the order of the Dead. Tonight was his initiation where he would prove himself worthy of the upper realms of study. If there was one thing that Silak loved more than his scales then that would be power. Shivering against the late night chill, Silak quickened his step as he made his way to his destination. The Magic Tower, the imposing monolith where all Iksar magic was performed and studied. Silak's claws clacked against the cobblestones as he moved down the deserted streets. There were few lights on the street, the Iksar having little need for them. Lost in thought Silak didn't realize that he reached his destination. The street opened up into a large open courtyard. There were several statues littering the yard but in the center was the true focus. Sticking straight up from the center of the yard was a large imposing tower. The turret at the top barely visible, so great was the height of the structure. Silak stood there for several moments just staring at the tower and wondering at the great works of magic being done there. So fixed was his attention on the tower he failed to notice the guard creep up on him until they were practically standing nose to nose.
<br><br>
"State your business!" The guard stated in a loud commanding voice. Silak was momentarily stunned by the sudden appearance of the muscled warrior dressed in studded leather. When he didn't answer immediately the guard's grip on his sword hilt tightened. Silak gathered his wits about him and managed to stammer out why he was there. The guard gave him a dubious look, necromancers being barely tolerated by the Iksar as it were, and waved Silak on with a grunt and a motion of his hand. Moments later the guard had melted back into the shadows. Silak, however, had the distinct feeling that there were eyes watching him, more pairs than just the surly guard's.  Giving a quick furtive glance around the courtyard, Silak pulled his hood up even more and quickly made his way to the front doors of the tower.  Silak reached the ornate doors and paused a moment to straighten his robes before lifting his hand to knock. Before his hand touched the doors they swung open on silent hinges. Silak could see nothing beyond the door except unending darkness. Repressing a shudder he stepped through the threshold.  The doors shut silently behind him and he was engulfed in darkness. Then he could see, not so much because a light was produced but rather the darkness seemed to recede. Standing before him was an acolyte of his own order, the patch on his robes marking him as having passed his ordeals. The acolyte bowed to Silak and spoke in their hissing language.
<br><br>
"Welcome Silak," the acolyte said, "You have been expected, the council awaits your presence then the testing shall begin. If you would please follow me." The acolyte turned on his heel and strode into the darkness.
<br><br>
Silak took one last glance at the doorway but only bare wall met his vision. He shivered involuntarily and slowly followed the acolyte into the darkness.  The acolyte led Silak into an apparently empty room. He gave Silak a final bow and left him in the darkness. Silak stood there waiting, his scales clicking together in nervousness. Silak turned a full circle examining the room. He could see nothing beyond the small beam of light that he was standing in. The source of this light was also not visible. Suddenly in the middle of the room, or at least what Silak guessed was the middle, a large table appeared as if it had been there the entire time. The table was covered in carvings that represented the four orders of magic; it was the most beautiful table Silak had ever seen before. Behind the table sat four large thrones of sturdy wood. Each was decorated in similar fashion as the table but each throne displayed the symbols of the cloaked figure that sat there. The one in the center was covered in grinning skulls and demons. The figure that sat there was completely swathed in a gray cloak that looked as if it had been used to cover someone long buried. It hung in thin wisps and seemed to float and move like it had a life of it's own. A chill emanated from the figure; it was the chill of the grave. It pierced Silak's skin and drove to his heart, sheathing it in ice. Silak quailed before the terror that flowed from necromancer sitting before him. Just when Silak thought he was surely to die from the fear it suddenly lifted. He gasped as he could draw a breath again. Silak's breath was stolen away from him a moment later when the head of his order began to laugh. It was a low whispering laugh; it grated on Silak's ears. The laugh was so horrible and filled with evil that Silak thought he would surely go mad. Even the other heads of the orders seemed visibly shaken by the sound. Then the laughter stopped and the head of The Order of the Dead began to speak. His voice sounded like it came from far away, sounded like it came from the grave Silak thought. The voice clawed at his mind like the skeletal fingers of those that Silak has made rise up and do his bidding.
<br><br>
"So, young one," the voice hissed "you wish to join our ranks?" Realizing slowly that he was being asked a question, Silak stumbled over his response.
<br><br>
"Y-yes s-sir. I wish to join The Order of the Dead and I humbly ask your acceptance of my application." He bowed low as he said this. The head of Silak's order turned to confer briefly with the other members at the table. After a moment he spoke again to Silak.
<br><br>
"You will be tested young Silak, to see if your skills are worthy enough to be accepted into our order. Know one thing, our order has the most stringent requirements for entry. To be able to command the arts at a necromancer's disposal one must devote mind, body, and soul. Should you fail, you will beg with every breath for a quick death. Do you understand young Silak?" Silak could only nod; his throat having closed shut in fear.  "Go then, and pray to whatever god you believe in that you make it, you'll need all the help you can get." As suddenly as they had appeared the heads of the order were gone. Silak blinked wondering if they had been real. He then had the uncomfortable sensation of the floor falling away from his feet. Silak shut his eyes fearing what might come next.
<br><br>
When he opened his eyes Silak found himself in another part of the tower. It was dark and the floor was covered in dust. There was a hallway leading off in both directions. Beyond that there were no other features in the hall. Silak checked the spells he had committed to memory before he left the room. Finding them satisfactory he picked a direction and followed the hall. He wandered the dusty halls for what seemed like hours. Just when Silak was about to give up and just teleport back to his soft warm bed he heard something, the sound of metal on metal. Silak pressed his back against the wall and mumbled the words to a spell. The shadows darkened and gathered around Silak as the spell took effect. Soon he was cloaked in shadows, practically invisible against the wall. He held his breath and waited for the source of the noise to come into view. He didn't wait long, soon a high elf dressed in a mixture of plate and chain mail stumbled into view. He paused, leaning on the corner to catch his breath. Silak could feel an aura of goodness surrounding the elf.
<br><br>
"Paladin," Silak nearly spat. The elf started at the sound. Steel rang as he drew his sword from his scabbard.
<br><br>
"Who's there?" the paladin asked in a voice that was weary with hunger and lack of sleep. Despite his haggard appearance his eyes still burned with a righteous fire as they darted back and forth searching for the source of the voice. Silak stepped from the shadows and called upon the winds from beyond the grave to stir his cloak around his body.
<br><br>
"Your death…" Silak hissed in response. The paladin's eyes widened in fear for an instant then hardened.
<br><br>
"This day you die evil spawn, in the name of the Mother you will taste my steel." Silak waved a hand and evil visions of death danced in front of the elf's eyes. He just shook off the fear spell and advanced towards Silak.
<br><br>
"You're more powerful than I gave you credit, elf." Silak spat "But you are no match for me."
<br><br>
"We shall see." The paladin responded. At that moment he lunged at the necromancer with his sword outstretched. Silak was faster however, with a wave of his hand and a spoken word the paladin was frozen place. Silak stepped back and raised his voice in a chant. He traced symbols in the air, which began to glow green. Silak completed his chant and pointed a finger at the elf and a blast of green light poured over the paladin. His skin withered and tightened against his bones. It was like the paladin was being sucked dry. The light then reversed course and flowed over Silak. Silak grinned in triumph as the paladin's life force was added to his own. The elf collapsed into a heap unable to bear the weight of his armor on his wasted frame. Silak walked over to the heap and kicked the elf over on to his back. He was troubled to notice that the paladin still lived.
<br><br>
"Stubborn breed," Silak mumbled as he started to draw his dagger, intent on finishing the job. Suddenly the paladin lifted his hands and laid them on his chest. Speaking the name of his god he was enveloped in a bright blue light. The muscles grew back on his bones and the color returned to his cheeks.
<br><br>
"Damn," Silak cursed. "Forgot about that little trick." The paladin wasted no time and sprang at the necromancer bearing him to the ground. The elf wrapped his hands around Silak's throat intent on squeezing the life out of the lizard. The elf's eyes suddenly bulged out in pain and surprise. His grip loosened around Silak's neck as he lifted his body off of the lizard. He stared down at his side where Silak's dagger was still buried up to the hilt in his gut. Grasping at the knife feebly the paladin's eyes rolled back and his head and he collapsed, dead. Silak bent to retrieve his dagger and wiped the blood off on one of the elf's pouches. He quickly perused the body for anything of worth, finding only some coins and a magical scroll. The scroll was one of undead protection or something like that. Silak didn't spend long looking at it. He shoved the scroll in his belt and kneeled beside the body placing his hands on the elf's quickly cooling forehead and over the place where his heart was. Silak began chanting in a deep voice. Mist gathered around his hands and began to flow around the body. The elf turned to dust, armor and all leaving only a skeleton behind. Silak removed his hands and stood. A few moments later the skeleton stirred and slowly got to his feet. It stood unmoving, waiting command. Silak bent to retrieve the paladin's sword and gave it to the skeleton.
<br><br>
"You will protect me in this ordeal," he ordered.
<br><br>
"Yes master," the skeleton responded, his voice the paladin's but distant as if it were just a shadow of the original. Silak smiled and motioned for his pet to follow him.
<br><br>
They walked down the same hallway for quite awhile. The hall curved and had many corners but no side passages or any rooms of any kind. That's why Silak was surprised when he rounded a corner and the hall ended in a plain non-discript door. It was bound with iron and looked very old. The hinges were rusted as was the handle, but other than that it was in good shape.  Silak could feel a strong magical power coming from the other side of the door. He longed for that power.
<br><br>
"Open the door." He ordered the skeleton.
<br><br>
"Yes master." It walked over, grasped the handle and gave a mighty tug. The door did not budge. The skeleton tried again and this time the door gave way with a loud screech as the hinges protested not being accustomed to such work. A blast of cold air and the smell of molding paper flowed out from the door. Silak stepped through the door and into a massive library.  His eyes widened as he gazed at the rows upon rows of magical spell-books. He hurried among the shelves looking at the bindings searching for a book that might prove useful. He stopped as he reached a small podium at the end of the room. On it rested a book bound in leather of darkest black with silver runes traced along it. He picked up the book almost reverently and clutched it to his chest. He placed the book in a backpack he carried with him and turned to search some more. As he turned he notice part of the shadows were staring back at him. Fear clutched his chest as a darker shadow parted from the rest of the darkness. Silak cursed his stupidity for not thinking there would be a guardian. He ordered his pet to attack the thing of darkness in hope it would be able to do something against the monstrosity. The skeleton got no more than two steps before the ink black, shadow raised what might have been and arm and spoke a word. The skeleton exploded in a cloud of bone dust. The shadow then pointed at Silak. He had barely enough time to raise a spell of shielding before the bolt of poison struck him. Silak breathed a sigh of relief and prepared his counter spell. The wraith was quicker, moving in to touch Silak with hands as cold of the grave. He gasped for breath as the chill filled him and the words to his spell slipped from his mind. Silak stumbled away to the other side of the room in attempt to get away. The wraith glided over to where Silak cowered against the floor, its arms raised in spell casting. Thoughts raced through Silak's head and out the other side before he could grasp them. Then one thought rang in his mind, the scroll! He fumbled at his belt searching for the scrap of paper that was his only chance. He unrolled it and quickly scanned the contents. He forced himself to take a breath and calm down. He began to chant the words. Hearing them the wraith paused, knowing the spell. It rushed to finish its spell before Silak could his. A burst of acid flew from the wraith's hands just as Silak finished his casting. The scroll burst into flames just before the wave of acid hit the young necromancer. The wraith screamed in pain and anger as the scroll's spell took effect. Pain filled Silak's mind pushing out all other thoughts. Happily he let unconsciousness wash over him and carry him into the cooling black void.
<br><br>
Silak woke in the same room that he had spoken with the heads of the orders. The pain that had covered him was gone. He looked around, the table and chairs were not there. Suddenly they were, as if they had been there the whole time, just like the last time Silak had been here.
<br><br>
"I take this to mean I passed, master?" Silak asked.
<br><br>
"Yes you did," the leader of The Order of the Dead said in his quiet voice. It still unnerved Silak to hear it. "But at great cost to yourself," he continued. "Look at yourself young acolyte." Silak looked at his hands and his voice choked in anger and surprise. His hands were horrible scared from the acid. His once beautiful scales burned away. Those left were gray and dead. He reached up to his face and could feel the same marks on his face.
<br><br>
The head necromancer began to laugh again.
<br><br>
"Yes, we must sacrifice certain things for the power. Your sacrifice is trivial compared to others." With that statement he reached up and drew back his hood with hands that were nothing but bone. The hood fell back revealing a skull bleached from years of being fleshless. Instead of eyes there were only two brightly glowing green fires. Silak imagined fleshless lips drewing back in a smile at the sight of his discomfort. Even the other heads of magic turned away from the gruesome sight. The head necromancer drew his hood back over his head and placed his hands in the folds of his sleeves.
<br><br>
"Welcome to The Order of the Dead, acolyte Silak.  You will be a welcome addition. Go now and advance your skill in the world, you may return here at anytime to learn more of our art." Silak bowed low to the assembled magic users. When he looked up he was outside of the tower staring at the ornate entry doors. The sun was just coming up and the city was stirring to life. Hiding his scared visage in the folds of his robes Silak hurried to his small room to gather his things. As he was preparing to place his belongings into his backpack he noticed something was all ready inside. He slowly drew out the book from the library. Clutching the book to his chest he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. His face twisted in rage and he hurled a bolt of power at the glass, shattering it. Looking back at the book he held in his hands he smiled again and finished packing. Making sure to avoid the townspeople, Silak slipped away into the forest as the sun climbed higher into the sky.
