Well now ya's sure she done run off?  I mean she could have had da snot beat outta her.  And while almost deaded, and ya's not round, da pally type done run up and did the sparkles dat feel good.  She might jist be thinking "Okay how's I's gonna done say thank ya's?"  And DEN she's figurin…  Welpers, I's can help bashy.
<br><br>
It's hard sometimes being a Bashy.  I's knows I's try ta be da bast bashy I can.  I's stand der and git thwaped fer da Holys, and smacked around.  Der's blood flying from me mouth, I's gots a gaping side wound, der's guts all over me legs and what's I do?  I's still keep screamin at da nastys and a swinging until I's fall down so da Holy's won't.  It's da only thingy I can do.  Git beat up again and again.  I's can't pray ta da Tribunal and bless someone, I's can't finger wiggle and make mean sparkles fly.  I's can only poor da red stuff inside me out fer me friends.
<br><br>
So, I dunt thinky maybe she lefted ya's cause dis pally is in her eyes better dan ya's.  I thinky ya's gots ta member what we bashys can do to say "I's done thank ya's fer dat" in one way.

<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
I am, as my race is so crudely referred to, an "Inkie", or a Teir'Dal. This has presented many, many problems for me, a struggling wizard, across the lands of Norrath. It seems wherever I go, people are more concerned with trying to kill me then to understand my dilemma. I worship no gods of an evil nature, as I see it only encourages them. And yet, though I persist in making the local gnoll or orc populations relatively extinct, the citizens of nearly every city I come to are hell-bent on putting my head on a pike. I can tell you, this is a discouragement to a growing wizard, just trying to make a living, like everybody else. Now, barring the act of rooting everyone in a city at once, so they are less inclined to run up and take a slash at me, can you suggest any other methods I may be able to win the trust of my fellow Norrathian, or at least get them to stop attacking me?
<br><br>
Sincerely,    Azrien

Dear Azrien,
<br><br>
Ya knows I thinky it's all them Voices o Hate jist flat out runin it fer ya's.  I's met one once.  He liked doggies and beasts which I's surprised ta finded out.  Kept talking bout em while talking ta me.  Well  I thinky at least.  He was talk'n ta me in a way I's couldn't understand him to good fer a sec.  But dat was da okay dokay part.  Da unokay dokay part was… he was sick!  Ayeps sick!  I's never ever seen a wood elf so bit by a rabid in me life!  Da holy has tried ta cast cure sick stuff on ya's type afore but it dunt worky.  He said it was da will o da Tribunal ya's looky so messed up and ya's must of done something really bad.
<br><br>
I thinky most see ya's dis way.  And wiff peoples likes these Voices running around  looking at ya's all funky like DIS:

<br><br>
Even DIS!
<br><br>

<br><br>
It's no wonder da other peoples dunt like ya's kind so much.  Perhaps iffen ya's can, ya's should change how ya's looky.  They's not gonna see past da fact that ya's look like ya's gots da rabies super bad when ya's walk into da shop.  They all thinking bout "Oh Honey!  Git da lil human-cub up stairs!  What do ya's mean not now there's a half elf yer trying to make a sale to, talk ta ya's in 2 hours?!"  and stuff.  SO they throw ya's out if not jist thwap ya's.

I's can understand da frustration.  It's like I's born dis way what's wrong wiff it?  I know I'd never felt dat way in me life until I went ta da rangers home.  I's standing there wantnn ta walky inta da bank and see dey made da doors to small so Oxes can't git in.  I mean…  NO ONE builds doors like dat unless dey dunt want Oxes round.
