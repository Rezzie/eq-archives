<b>Part Twelve</b>


<br><br>


   Gwyn was at the bottom of the stone steps that led to the upper palace when his sister caught up to him, seizing his arm.  He spared her a furious glance and wrenched out of her grasp.  
<br><br>
   "He's getting away!" he shouted at her.
<br><br>
   "No, <em>we</em> are," answered Kinory, and dragged him back the way they'd come.  He dug in his heels. 
<br><br>
   "I have a sworn duty, Kinory.  That may not mean much to you, but to me…"
<br><br>
   "Your duty was sworn to a man that is now dead!  Just as you will be, if you go haring off in search of revenge.  This is <em>his</em> territory."  She stabbed a finger in the direction of the fleeing Commander.  "He can say anything he wants, and who do you think they will believe?"  She let go of him abruptly.  "But go on and get killed if that's what you really want.  Gods know why I'm trying.  If it were up to you, I'd still be in that cell, awaiting execution."  She stalked down the corridor. Gwyn clenched his fist in frustration.  He glanced up the stairs, and then gritted his teeth.  She was right.
<br><br>
    "Where did you get so cynical?" he said, following her.
<br><br>
   "How did you stay so naïve?" she retorted, and came to a halt, looking up at a narrow window high on the wall.  In half a minute, she had scaled the rough stone and was fiddling with the lock.  A click, and the window swung easily open.  She paused, one foot outside, and glanced down.  "Are you coming?"  She vanished into the dark outside.  He looked down the hall toward the cellblocks, thinking of the men he'd left in there, and took a step away from the wall.
<br><br>
   From up the stairs, a cry arose, and footsteps pounded toward him.  Somhan had brought reinforcements.  Cursing the man, Gwyn sheathed his sword, and leaped, catching the lower edge of the window.  He struggled through the tiny window, and dropped heavily to the ground outside.
<br><br>
   "For gods' sake, keep it down," hissed a shadow.  He jumped.  
<br><br>
   "Kin?" he asked.
<br><br>
   "No, it's Erollisi Marr, come to fulfill your every desire.  Can we go now, please?"   The shadow melted along the wall silently.  He had a hard time actually keeping it in view.  Kinory's shape seemed to meld with whatever she was next to, and then suddenly he'd notice her ten feet further on, gesturing impatiently at him.
<br><br>
   He caught up to her once again, at the outer wall.
<br><br>
   "You walk like an elephant.  You're actually quieter when you <em>don't</em> try to sneak," she muttered.
<br><br>
   "Excuse me, I'm sure." He answered in a whisper.  "I didn't have the benefits of your no doubt extensive education in…"
<br><br>
    She clamped a hand over his mouth, pressing him to the wall.  Above, he heard the jingle of mail and then scuff of boots.  A squad of Militia ran by on the wall top.  Kinory stared him in the eyes, laid a finger over her lips, and then pointed to herself, then upward.  Another, somehow explicit gesture indicated that he was to stay by the wall or she would personally stake his feet to the ground.  
<br><br>
   A breath of air against his face, and she was gone.  If he squinted upward, he could just see a patch of shadow that flowed toward the top.  There was a pause, and then he saw, outlined against the lights of the city beyond, his sister gesturing him toward her.  He climbed the wall, if not with her grace and silence, at least with credible speed.
<br><br>
   "Thought I was going to get old and die up here, waiting."  He opened his mouth indignantly, but she was already gone over the outside edge.  He followed, swallowing his irate words with difficulty.
<br><br>
   He continued to follow her until she at last stopped outside a particularly disreputable looking tavern, and turned to him.
<br><br>
   "This is where we part ways, Guardsman," she said setting her jaw.  "Ok? The docks are to the right, or you can follow any street to the city wall and follow that to a Gate.  I'm not a tour guide, and I am done babysitting you.  Leave tonight and the Militia will never catch up to you.  They're even more ineffectual outside the city walls.  But I expect that you know that."
<br><br>
   "Yes, nothing much has changed since I served in the Militia… but what about you?"  He caught at her arm as she turned away.
<br><br>
   "Don't worry about me," she said, with such ire in her tone that he let go of her and took a few steps backward.  
<br><br>
   "I wouldn't have let them kill you, Kin. I would have found a way."   She stopped in her tracks.   "You're still my sister," he said.  She turned around.
<br><br>
    "I stopped needing you to take care of me a long time ago, Gwyn.  So don't pretend like I owe you any favors." She advanced on him, mouth twisted.  "Faydark is a long way away and a long time ago.  Things are not the way they were, and you can't put them back again.  I am not a part of your world anymore.  As far as I'm concerned, you <em>are</em> dead.   Alright?  Understand?"   She took a deep breath.  He saw the glimmer of tears in her eyes.
<br><br>
    "Kin..."  He reached out, but she was gone.
