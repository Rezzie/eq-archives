As I was wandring to and fro, I spied a soaring sight,<br>
A wood elf maid with hair of gold engage-ed in a fight.<br>
A Deathfist Foot, its lips snarled back, did press her hard and fast,<br>
And brave, brave Ambi showed no lack with sword in her hands clasped.<br>
On hillside did the swords ring high-- Foot massive, Ambi small,<br>
But, oh, her smalling frame was spry, and blow by blow did fall.<br>
<em>Ambi elf, your soul is brave! Your spirit made of fire.<br>
You did not run, nor ground you gave as you leapt into death's pyre.</em>
<br><br>

But fate had chosen differently, as Ambi soon did tell<br>
For Foot stood straight, a stone sentry, as if wounds were not felt.<br>
Soon sweat and blood ran down her chest and mingled in her hair.<br>
The Deathfist raised a howl to test if bravery turned despair.<br>
But Ambi stayed so proud and true, though strength began to fade.<br>
E'vn when the death-blow cleaved her through, her brave choice had been made.<br>
<em>Ambi elf, your soul is brave! Your spirit made of fire.<br>
You did not run, nor ground you gave as you leapt into death's pyre.</em>
<br><br>

Her winsome form fell quickly down in crumpled bloody heap,<br>
The Foot took rib-bone for a crown, with blood he striped his cheek.<br>
Till one who watched the fight took heart, though cowardly in act,<br>
A moment late played out his part and ran Foot through the back.<br>
But Elves don't weep, kind dwarves don't mourn for Ambi's fall this night<br>
For she did test and was proven born with a warriors gift of fight.<br>
<em>Ambi elf, your soul is brave! Your spirit made of fire.<br>
You did not run, nor ground you gave as you leapt into death's pyre.</em>
