We are planning to do an 'all roleplaying' issue very soon.  If you have an article about how to roleplay, or what makes roleplaying fun, or something along those lines, or any suggestions about what you think we should cover, please send it in right away.  We hope to do this for Issue 75.  Also, please send us your art.  Now that all of the other sites are asking for featured art, it seems that we don't get any.  That makes me sad, and keeps Archanalia real busy.  So please, send in your art.

<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="-1">
	South of the Rathe Mountains set into a foreboding wasteland is Oggok, City of Ogres. Bred for war and ultimately the destruction of all Norrath, Ogres are one of the most fearsome races you can play. While they are notoriously stupid, they are unlike their Troll neighbors in that they have a strong militant culture honed in the very likeness of their creator, Rallos Zek. All other life on Norrath are either cattle or enemies to Ogres, and both are there to be eaten.

I love this day.
<br><br>
It's one of those rare occasions where nobody is too busy to come have a drink with me.  I typically like to roll out of bed (or off the floor, out from under the table, out from behind the bar-from wherever it was that I spent the previous night) and peel whatever lovely thing I've spent the evening with from off of me.

Let me say a few words on stereotypes. Or rather, let me say more than a few words, and if you don't understand me than you must be an ignorant troll or perhaps a degenerate halfling. Do you see where this is going so far? I hope not, because I haven't gone anywhere just yet.

Dear Oghma,
<br><br>
	I am an enthusiastic Wood Elf Bard Fisherman. My favorite spot for fishing would have to be the Kaladim docks. There are 3 docks there, and you get a great view of the sunset and sunrise, plus I am surrounded by the wilderness. The docks are also the foreign quarter of Kaladim, and there are many shops around the docks that are owned by many other races from Faydwer<b>...</b>

Greetings! 
<br><br>
I am known as Faylina, aspiring Bard of Kelethin; and this is my tale. 
 <br><br>
Many months ago while supping with my father, a messenger arrived at our tree-hut.  He gave news that one Sta'vius had requested my presence in the gnomish city of Ak'Anon.  It seems that Sta'vius' father and my adventuring mother had traveled together many years before and the slight tinkerer desired our families remain close<b>...</b>

	It was a warm spring day, and I was daydreaming by the main lake in Felwithe.  Actually I was supposed to be studying, but instead I was trying to figure out where the large bass that I had almost caught yesterday might be hiding.  It was fairly warm, so he might be under the bridge. But on second thought, he could be deep in the middle of the lake. I had just about decided that I could forget about the rest of the days studies, when I heard a voice from over the wall.

I'm sorry to write to EQX, but was unable to find Foxglove's email address.
Foxglove,
<br><br>
    Your article "<a href="../Issue69/parttime.htm">Part Time</a>" was wonderful. You described my evenings, right
down to the snoozing husband. I have been struggling with the feeling of
"missing out" because I don't have a lot of playing time, either. I also
have children (2) and one of them, my 11 yr. old son, plays EQ,too, so I
have to give up afternoon play time to him (he keeps his grades up so he can
play EQ or UO)<b>...</b>

<b><u>Role-Playing in Norrath</b></u>
<br><br>
<em>I think that EE is definitely on to something, here.  I really like when people care about what they're doing, even if it is a glorified Internet game.  I myself really enjoy Everquest, but I have a plea.  I have long ago shut off OOC, and everything else, till I am down to just shouting and saying.  The problem is, as much as I'm interested in the roleplaying of the game, I still am bombarded by loads of shouts and messages that seriously detract from roleplaying integrity<b>...</b>
