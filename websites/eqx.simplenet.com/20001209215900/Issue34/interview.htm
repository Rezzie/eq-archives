<p style="text-align: justify">

Charles Flock works for Sony Interactive Studios.  He is the Beta Test Manager for an anxiously awaited game called EverQuest. He has a seventeen-year-old daughter and fourteen-year-old son.  I was honored that he took time out of his busy schedule to speak with me and grant me this interview.  Sorry for the lack of EQ related questions, but I didn't want to risk getting anyone into trouble.  Besides I want the game to be a total surprise for me when I get to play!  This is a more interesting interview anyway.  Charles is a very interesting person and just a pleasure to talk to.
<br><br>
Here is how it went…. 
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Mr. Flock welcome, and thanks for taking some time out of your busy schedule to talk with us.  You are probably the second most popular guy in the EQ scene right now.  I'm sure about 40,000 people out there would love to be one of your offspring right now.
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So they tell me
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Including me :)
<br><br>
He laughs.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'll just call you Dad
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahem
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   If you can, tell us how one becomes a beta test manager at Sony?  How the hell did you do it?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Well, I was in the right place at the right time.  Sony Interactive was just starting a San Diego test dept. and they needed a Mgr. My brother called me.  I sent a resume.   I was interviewed and hired.  Btw, my brother is the president. I suppose that helped.  Well, he is the president of the #2 Playstation developer.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow!!
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Have you heard of, and do you think Richard Bartles MUD archetypes hold true? 
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the Bartles paper was a very well done exposition of RP prototypes.  A must read for any serious rpg'r.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where do you think you fall in his rankings?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone falls in several places, I think. I am mostly exploring social I suppose.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EQ is often compared to a mud, and it would appear that most of the development team has played them.  What do you think people want out of a MUD?  What do you expect out of a mud.  What satisfies you?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I missed the heyday of muds I'm sorry to say but what little I have played them I'd say the interaction of players and the solving of the DM's puzzles and quests, which is what makes them fun.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's your history with RPGs?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started out on the original "Adventure", sometimes called "The Big Cave" in the early seventies. When I got a Commodore I played Zork, Ultima's, Bard's Tale etc.  I was compooterless for a few years so I missed the beginnings of on-line rpgs like meridian and the graphical on-line muds.  Also I was pretty much an adult when D&D and other pen and paper games came out so I would say I missed out on those too. It' hard to find players when your the only grown up who wants to play them.  I had the games and figures, dice etc. I sorta played by myself. My then wife thought I was nuts.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When you played characters, what types of characters do you find most satisfying? 
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm. It's not the type of character so much as my self perceived success at RPing them. If you mean what types do I like to play, I'd say good aligned PC's are my favorites. Pals, Bards, Mages.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why Mages?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried my hand at dark elf necros but felt pretty silly as I continued acting like a paladin.  Not a successful necro when you give gold to the poor or save their necks.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And least satisfying?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Least? Well, humans I guess. Because I am human in rl it's not removed enough from everyday life to get me wrapped in the fantasy.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In your opinion, where do you think online gaming is heading?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As more people get on-line and as the technology moves forward online gaming is going to become a major source of recreation and cyber socializing. Where else can you meet and become gaming partners and even friends with people from all over the world? This is a genre in it's infancy but has a vast potential.
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need a better substructure to resolve the latency problem but I believe that is coming within a very few years.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Now talking about modern day online multi player rpg's.... Player killing has become a huge topic during conversation about online gaming.  What are your feelings on Pkilling?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I think the Quake types are extremely detrimental to on-line gaming. It's a shame that true rp PKing is virtually eliminated by the "<em>d00d</em>" types.  I play with my switch on most of the time.  It didn't take an hour to be randomly PK'd.   The guy went so far as to get his other higher level character and come back to get me after our IC battle.   It was actually fun until he decided winning was more important than acting out the developing scenario. Both of us were level one and it could have been a blast. Gnome vs. Dwarf.   This is why Brad put the switch in. If PK'ing was always part of a greater purpose it plays an essential role in game immersion.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are your feelings on guilds, and do you plan to join one?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Again, in principle, Guilds are fine but they turn into social cliques I find distasteful. So no, I won't be joining one officially.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Do you feel that in an RPG setting that people should have vast character backgrounds? I have noticed quite a few have taken the time to write histories and dispositions for their characters. Do you condone this activity, or do you find it extreme? 
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I think it is premature. A character needs time in the environment to find out who he is or is going to be. Too much history becomes defeating I think. Being consistent with the world that you discover is better than trying to invent one before hand. A little background is necessary. But only a little.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often speak of my family and how the computer has effect our relationships, and ultimately how we cope with it.  What does your wife think of the computer, and how much time your family spends on it?  Is she also a Geek in training?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not married at this time. Serious relationships are too complicated. Maybe I'll get back to that scene in a while, but I'm pretty satisfied the way things are now.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear that ladies?   He is available!
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   As far as our becoming a compooter family that is definitely happening. My daughter has just recently discovered the fun of interacting with people from distant places and spends about six hours a day on line
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My son is a typical (no offense kids) fourteen year old power gamer. He has spent a few hours a day playing <a href=" http://www.tanarus.com">Tanarus</a>.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   How many computers to you own to accommodate this?
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Hehe. Just one but with the inevitable fights for access I'll probably get a second sometime this year. Teens are too expensive.!
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ONE!  Oh there would be blood shed in our house!  Mostly mine!  The kids would murder me.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Every kid had heroes growing up. Who were your top three idols when you were young? Who are your top three now? And why? 
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I grew up in the 60's when heroes were scarce. I admired the astronauts. Various writers have always been an inspiration to me.  Oh and Clapton. I play guitar so he was important to me, and Today?   I don't think I have any heroes. I admire my brothers.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your stories on EQX have been just wonderful..  What inspires you to write like that?  who are your influences
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My main influence has to Cormac McCarthy. I definitely try to emulate his style. For subject matter I guess I'm Tolkien inspired. Writing for me is almost automatic. I create a character then completely lose control of the situation. I am always surprised where the stories go. It is a lot like taking a guitar solo. You have a basic idea but something happens that sends you helplessly on a tangent.  I have only written three stories so far. Well, two and a half. I hope to get better at it soon.  You guys are my inspiration. Great stuff.   
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I want to do one story for each of the different fantasy races.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I hope I say this for all our readers.  We hope you continue to write for us :)
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I certainly plan to.
<br><br>
<b>Razor:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're the first and only colonist on the moon. You don't expect any others in your lifetime. You have the essentials; food, water, shelter, but nothing else. You get one luxury item from a very short list: a fast computer and a fast connection to the Internet or another human being. Which would you chose and why?  <em>For the record..  This was from Absor.. haha  (he's weird that way)</em>
<br><br>
<b>Flock:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well ask me this at another time and I'd answer differently but right now I'd go with the compooter. I tend to be a little agoraphobic so being alone doesn't bother be. Being lonely is a different thing. You're never alone on the 'net.
<br><br>
EQX wants to thank Mr. Flock for giving us his time.  And don't forget to read his wonderful
