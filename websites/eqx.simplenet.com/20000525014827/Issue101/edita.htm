My printer doesn't work!
<br><br>
I only wish that this particular problem was something that you folks cared one tiny bit about.  Because if you did, right now I could dedicate this entire editorial to my frustration over that fact...
<br><br>
Instead I'll talk about something just as unrelated to EverQuest.  I want to dive back into talking about my weekly pen and paper game.  It's a revival game, a sort of back to our roots thing.
<br><br>
We're revisiting the Giants.  You experienced D&Ders will know this.  The big fellas raid Human territory all the time when their own supplies run low.  But they do so as individuals or small family groups.  It's a pain for the Humans, but it's not a trauma any worse than any other that frontier folks go through all the time.  Many years ago, however, the big brutes got organized.  Instead of raiding, they were conquering.  And at the time it was up to some heroes to put a stop to that.  When we tackled the job, we failed.  Yup.  But then, we have to work under the evil GM.  You wouldn't have done any better, I tell you.
<br><br>
Actually, it wasn't a complete failure.  We did discover that it was Drow organizing the Giants, and, though I can't remember how, we managed to disorganize them enough to stop the raids.  I think we just passed enough information on to the powerful NPCs of the world and went home to lick our wounds.
<br><br>
In fact, the only parts of that game that I remember real clearly were that we weren't even able to penetrate the Giants' steading until a one day player showed up with a Dwarf wearing some sort of gloves of digging.  We had been poking around that place for days trying to find a way in, and couldn't.  Then this guy shows up for one game and digs us in.
<br><br>
And the other thing I remember is what happened once we got in.  One of our characters went down, unconscious but not yet dead.  In the only act of heroism that we've ever seen him perform, our assassin grabbed the unconscious PC and slung him over his shoulder in order to get him out alive.  We were all a bit shocked, but nobody said anything about it, afraid that he might suddenly realize that he was being nice and stop for fear of it ruining his reputation.  But the Giants were in pursuit.  And Giants use <b>really big</b> crossbows.  Normally, as a ninja/assassin, our new hero would be able to dodge such a large missile.  But at that moment his heroics burdened him with an extra 200 pounds, and he wasn't feeling very agile.
<br><br>
Me, I woulda dropped the chump and ran like mad.  But our assassin was still feeling heroic, in his own way.  He slightly shifted his burden, and kept running.  The bolt was well aimed.  But our hero had a few feet of flesh to shield him.  The bolt penetrated the Human (Half-Elven, maybe) shield and poked gently into the back of our hero.
<br><br>
He made a good point, at least he recovered the corpse.
<br><br>
So now it's ten years later, and the Giants are at it again.  They've conquered several small Human frontier towns, as well as a few Elven forest villages.  So, once again, the call goes out for heroes to do something about it.  Me, I drag out a character that I haven't played in years.  If anyone else showed me this character, I would have been wondering what Monty Haul game this jerk usually played in.  I mean, what kind of goof has a character that is a multi-class magic-user/cleric, with psionics (wild talent) and is also a weretiger?  He's also loaded down with nearly every useful magic item in the book. TWO rings of wizardry?  If it was someone else's character, I would have been shaking my head and, most likely, I would have had a low opinion of the player.
<br><br>
In fact, I think the rest of the group was doing exactly that.
<br><br>
But, of course, it's my character, dammit, and I earned everything.  I can recount how I gained most of those items.  I can ever recount how, as a guilty player, I purposefully lost some even more powerful items.  Playing that character sure did teach me a bit of a lesson about jumping to conclusions.
<br><br>
But that's not the only thing I learned.  I also learned that a character with two spell casting classes at tenth level, all of the magic items in the world, and a bad case of turning into a big monster when he's angry, is a very complicated character.  It took me a week to update the character sheet so that I could play him.  And playing him is tough.  I have to balance his immense magical power with the fact that he's paper-thin.  Two swaps from a giant and he's a spot, mulch.  If I can walk that line, he is the most powerful character that I have, even more so than Absor, the bazillionth level bard.
<br><br>
Despite common belief among my jealous co-players, it's not his power that makes him fun to play.  Well, it's not <u>just</u> his power that makes him fun to play.  It's the fact that he's such a complicated person.  He started out a fun loving jokester.  His worship of the cat goddess Bast tended to make him playful.  And his love for magic made him a collector.  He would take the silly treasure, as long as it was magical...  "Hey, you guys don't really want those rings of swimming, right?  You won't need them now that we've defeated the watery enemy.  I'll take them as my share of the treasure..."  At one time he had six rings of swimming.
<br><br>
But somewhere along the line his humor became bitter.  I think it was after he was bitten by a lycanthrope and was unable to account for his actions on the nights when the moon was anywhere near full.  It's not easy being a healer and suspecting that you are a murderer as a hobby.  He became rather unpleasant, and very paranoid.  He started spending less and less time in cities, and more time as a recluse.  There didn't seem to be any way for him to remain sane and still fear that he was killing the same people that he protected.  So he vowed to stay away from them.
<br><br>
And then, he me god.  He found a magical trinket during his travels.  He used his psychic powers to learn of its past.  It turned out that the last one to possess the item what Bast herself.  It also turns out that the item had the power to summon her, and in a time of need, he did so.  He called the goddess of Cats in order that she might protect her own kind when it was beyond his skill.  She did so.  And she also changed the nature of his illness.  He was no longer a werebear (that's what the D&D books told us that a Choatic Good character would become cursed with lycanthropy), he became a weretiger.  It was a bit of a comfort to him.  And after several years in that form, he gained control of his rage and was able to transform when he needed to, though it was still beyond him to prevent the change on the full moon.  He remained a hermit.  He spent his time protecting the creatures of his goddess.
<br><br>
Most recently he traveled to the Bad Place.  Most of you D&Ders would call in Ravenloft.  While there, he lost control of himself.  In that place there is no 'control' for the cursed.  He gained the full rage of the beast, he became a true were.  There is a distinct difference between a cursed one and a full lycanthrope.  He became far more powerful, but he was also no longer a half-elf.  He is now a monster.  He angers easily, and when he gets angry...  well, to steal a great line from a sad television show, you wouldn't like him when he's angry.
<br><br>
He is a very different character now.  He no longer cares for humans (or Elves or Dwarves...) much at all.  At times he nearly forgets how to speak the common tongue.  He does go into town once every few years to gather a few items that he needs, like spells or training, but he lives exclusively in the wild now.  He doesn't do so to protect these people, but because he no longer cares for them.  He finds them stupid and boring.  Tedious.  And now that he has decided to join with the current group of heroes, it's interesting to see how he interacts with a bunch of strong-willed Human types.  One of them just happens to be a werewolf hunter...
<br><br>
I'm sorry for the non-EverQuest nature of this editorial (and, I guess the non-editorial nature of it).  But I do so enjoy pen and paper roleplaying.
