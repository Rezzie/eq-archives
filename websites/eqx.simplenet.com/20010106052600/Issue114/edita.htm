I can't do it!
<br><br>
There are NOT enough hours in the day!
<br><br>
Part of it is my fault, I know.  I tend to do things the slow and established way.  Take EQX for example.  I'm quite certain that some innovative young whippersnapper could get it all edited and ready for the web in half the time it takes me.  But by the time I sit down to do something like this I've only got enough time to get it done the old way, not enough to experiment with new ways, even if the new way might save me time later.
<br><br>
That, and I think slow.  Not all the time.  I'm pretty good when put to the test in a game, for example.  When the situation calls for a snap decision, I have no problem making one.  But when it comes to being creative, I'm as slow as...  well...  I'm as slow as a...  hmmm...  slow as a snail.  It takes me twice as long as others to come up with an end to a story or a topic for an editorial.  I'll stand by my creations once they finally appear, but I can't stand how long it takes me to make them show up.
<br><br>
And now I find myself overwhelmed with things that require creativity.  Before the weekend is over I'll probably just shut down.  If you don't hear me crying violently from within the paper-thin walls of my tiny apartment on Monday (or huddled on the floor of my tiny cubicle at work), then you'll know what happened.  You will, the people at work won't be able to tell the difference.
<br><br>
I guess what I'm trying to say is this, I don't have a clue what to write about in this editorial.  My mind is flooded with ideas for the D&D campaign that I'm working on (well, flooded is a very generous term, it's more like I'm busy squeezing the blood out of the turnip of my mind).  I'm also dreaming of ideas for Neverwinter Nights modules.  Then there's my intense desire to help an old friend with one of his creative projects (I don't know if it's a secret, so I won't mention it, but suffice it to say that it, too is a creative project).  I've also been writing two separate stories about the same character.  I have no idea why I'm doing that.  I suppose that I harbor a secret hope that I can write two half stories (one of my best and most useless skills - writing half stories) and stick them together to make a whole.  Dang, that would be nice, finishing an entire story.
<br><br>
Though with all of this going on I just haven't played EQ at all in the last several weeks, so how in the world can I write about it?
<br><br>
I guess I'll have to save up, nurse my creative energies, and give you something spectacular and EQ-related next week.  In the meantime, enjoy this issue, and hold on for the Ruins of Kunark, the rumors sound pretty good about it.
