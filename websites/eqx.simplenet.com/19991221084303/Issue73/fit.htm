QEYNOS -
<br><br>
The Darkpaw gang has again struck, interrupting the snake-hunting ritual of a handful of inexperienced Qeynos residents.
<br><br>
"Damn gnolls won't give us a moment's peace," said Altuk Moorn who witnessed the assault performed by the notorious Flippy Darkpaw, "We were minding their own business, squashing bugs and hacking up snakes when that bastard came in and cut a bunch of us down.  It was so senseless."
<br><br>
Reached for comment, Djerr Darkpaw, spokes-dog for the Darkpaw clan, had this to say:
<br><br>
"BBBBBAAAARRRKKKK!!!!! You humans will pay for ruining our homeland!!  GRRRRRRRRR!!!!! Family Darkpaw of the Sabretooth Clan will slay you all!!! BARK!"

Hoi there! Lrets D'pearl here with the latest in breaking news across the lands of Norrath! 
<br><br>
For many years the Aqua goblins of Dagnor's Cauldron have held a virtual monopoly over the amusement park industry with the construction of the "Cauldron Water and Theme Park". However, in the last year, the Aqua Goblins have had their lofty position as kings of the Amusement parks toppled by the ingenious minds and creative works of the Gnolls of Black Burrow. As reported several weeks ago, the Gnolls of Black Burrow opened their Black Burrow Water Park and introduced what is now being called the revolutionary interactive water pool. Black Burrow owners turned a simple, and mostly boring, swimming pool into a nail biting and blood pumping experience by adding live razorgills to their pool. The addition of the razorgills met with unprecedented success, drawing untold numbers of visitors from miles around just to see the wondrous pool. Walking into the place, I could barely see my feet for all the people crowded into that place! :) 
<br><br>
One would think that the Black Burrow water park owners would be content to sit on their laurels and bask in their success as the platinums rolled in, but this is not the case. Just yesterday they unveiled a new attraction which is predicted to draw even more spectators to Black Burrow (<em>snort! Great! Just what we need! More people in Black Burrow</em>). With the use of highly specialized illusion magics and levitation spells, the Gnolls of Black Burrow have created the "Virtual Swim Experience"

<br><br>
Owners say that this ride was created to meet the demands of those people that did not have the swimming skill ... or cajones ... to take a dip in the interactive swimming pool. Hopes are high for this new attraction, and judging from the reaction of park visitors, the "Virtual Swim Experience" looks to be a winner. As can be indicated by the reaction of a local visitor from Qeynos Hills," It is so real! I cant believe how they captured every nuance of the act of swimming! I never need to swim again!" 
<br><br>
In light of all this activity, the Aqua Goblins at "The Cauldron" have finally decided to respond to those upstart Gnolls on Antonica. I was one of the first people to see the unveiling of The Cauldron's new "Penny Arcade" With the inventive use of local decor, the Caudron goblins have done an amazing job of capturing the ambience of Dagnor's Cauldron. The penny arcade holds a plethora of amusing skits and stories captured on magic globes which can be viewed through eyeports cut into walls designed to emulate the cliffs of Dagnor's Cauldron. Literally hundreds of plats were spent to create this penny arcade, and let me tell you it is evident when first entering the place.

<br><br>
What this all means ... well, all I can say is how lucky we citizens of Norrath are, as we find new and funner things to do across the lands of Norrath ... on a daily basis. Now all we need is a Virtual Life experience ... then we won't need to live lives anymore! Now THAT would be revolutionary!

This is Lrets D'pearl Aspiring Bard Extraordinaire and Freelance Reporter for Fit to Print signing off until next time, with a special report on HOW those ladies of Norrath can wear Metal armor without getting shredded to pieces, and the question everyone has been dyeing to ask ..."Does it really give them that much protection?"
