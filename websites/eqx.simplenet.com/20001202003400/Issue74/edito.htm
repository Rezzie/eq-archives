Once again, I’ve started another character <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
.  Oghma languishes at 14<SUP>th</SUP>, waiting for friends to catch up, I’m busy trying to level my F’leurs DuMal Character, I have a small band of short characters (Dwarves and gnomes)  called alternately the Lollipop Guild or the Underfoot, I have a gnome enchantress learning the ways of jewelry, my step daughter has a character that I play for her, and here I am starting another character – I must be insane!  I have a life, too – really!
<br><br>
I started a half-elf bard on the new Rodcet Nife server named Bian, and I wanted to try something that I knew was possible – leveling without fighting.  I decided to do as many quests as I could find, and see where it took me.  It was one way of defining my character (&quot;I’m a runner, not a fighter&quot;) and also learning more about the quests available in Qeynos, since I haven’t really played in Qeynos since phase II of the beta test.  Qeynos was the first EQ city Verant created, and had, at least to my knowledge, more quests available.
<br><br>
I started with a bard quest, and made 2<SUP>nd</SUP> level on that quest alone.  Ranging into North Qeynos, I discovered another, and then made 3<SUP>rd</SUP> level while doing two North – South Qeynos quests and two Surefall Glade to South Qeynos ones, and another North Qeynos – West Karana one.  I carried 4 separate quest items in my inventory at a time, running from quest to quest. I was 1/2way through 4<SUP>th</SUP> level when I had to cave and start killing things, because I got hungry ;). This took actually no more time than it would normally take to reach 4<SUP>th</SUP> level, which I thought was encouraging.  I also did not have to kill a single NPC to complete any of these.
<br><br>
The key here is that I repeated the quests over and over, when I thought it made sense to repeat them.  I didn’t repeat a quest if it seemed like it was dead end, or if it wasn’t a quest that made sense to re-do periodically.  I wound up in a sort of weird place for a character – my singing skill was 25, my sense direction 20, and my 1-handed slashing, defense, and offense were all 1 or 0.  At fourth level, with all those hit points, a fire beetle was spanking me.  I actually had to run to the guards.   The bard lookout must have been laughing his ass off.
<br><br>
I also tried to do a quest which went all the way into South Karana – and boy was that scary… level 3, stripped naked, racing past treants and lions.  I almost made it, but a cyclops came up to me just as I found my target NPC and, well, Bian was found later, weak as a kitten, outside the North Qeynos gates…
<br><br>
I saw on the Stratics site where the Periodic Poll asks whether Verant should changes quests to give more experience/rewards, and in light of my experiences to 5<SUP>th</SUP> level (I just HAD to get Selo’s Accelerando, now I’m a runner with ooomph)  I’m not sure we really need the exp. points/rewards boosted – except in some specific cases.
<br><br>
If a quest is repeatable, it serves several purposes.  It can give a small amount of experience, a small amount of money, and bring a faction level up to a more useful level.  The bard merchants in Qeynos LOVE me, and I’m making good money selling only to them.  Repeating it gives you those advantages over and over, and I think that is a GOOD THING.  Eventually, the experience bonuses are too small to make a difference and you move on to bigger and better quests.
<br><br>
My &quot;bigger and better quest&quot; was the one that took me into South Karana.  When I made 5<SUP>th</SUP> level, I ran like the wind into South Karana, did that big important quest, ran back to Qeynos, and got: 7 copper and a barely noticeable exp. boost.  Now, I can understand that for a quest from one end of Qeynos to another – but to run to South Karana, five zones away, where there are scarecrows and lions and centaurs and bears, oh my!?  At least Dorothy got some magic slippers…
<br><br>
This quest was of the run-once variety, also, with no real &quot;story line&quot; reasons to repeat it besides a faction hit.  I think there should be a file kept of the characters who complete these sort of quests, and boost the rewards. Many quests have the rewards increase as you repeat it, with excellent results, and perhaps this is one of them, but an effort of that magnitude really deserves more.  I will probably try to repeat a few times, because I did discover one good thing from this experience: Many quests point to more quests.
<br><br>
I’ve discovered 5 or 6 other quests from running these, and while I know some of them I am not ready for, it is very cheering to know that Verant has thought much of this out.  There are quests that require more than one party member, and some that require specific classes, even if any class can do that particular quest.  I am getting a sense of the relationships that exist between all the factions, and finding real tension in the Surefall Glades.  It’s <I>interesting</I> I’m looking forward to finding more, but I think that I will start killing now, even though a decaying skeleton may hurt me badly <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
.  I’m also going to bring along a ranger, who can track some of these elusive npcs, and forage for food out on the Karana plains.
<br><br>
If you see a guy named Bian racing past you in a blue glow, the sound of a beating drum marking each footfall – say hello!
