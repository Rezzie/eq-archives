I just finished talking to a friend of mine.  This friend, along with some others, have been playing on a different server than I do.  And yet, he wants me to start a character and join his group…  But he's already 9th level, and I already have a main character to play (along with a real serious desire to play another one) on a different server.  This situation is one that causes some folks a bit of stress about the way EverQuest is set up.  Some folks can't play as often as their friends, and others just started later.  So is there a way to catch up and keep up?  First, read <a href="parttime.htm">this article</a> by Foxglove...
<br><br>
Well, I decided to create a character on that server and see if it's at all possible to keep up with a group that plays more often than you do (since these are their main characters and my tertiary character) and have a large head start.  Knowing that this would be the case, I chose my character carefully.  At the time he called, his character was in ButcherBlock, so I would have to be able to get there in one piece.  That rules out Barbarians.  It's just too far for me to travel to meet them, even if I get bound to Kaladim.  The group is of the goodie-good type (he's a High Elf Wizard), so I would have to be able to travel with them.  That rules out Troll, Ogre and Tier'dal, unless I wanted to play with them much later, after I convince the goodies that I'm a nice Ogre.  I'm currently playing a cleric, and the character that I want to play with the EQX folks is an enchanter.  So I was inclined to play a warrior type.  I really don't like High Elves (I don't really know why), so they were out.
<br><br>
I finally settled on a Human Warrior.  Really for two reasons.  One is because I have a character personality in mind for him.  And the other is leveling.  With a Human Warrior I should have a better chance of catching an keeping up with my friends, even part time.  A Human warrior should advance the fastest of any race and class combination.  I chose Freeport to start in, heck it's only a short boat ride from ButcherBlock.  And then I was off and running.
<br><br>
I did no roleplaying at all.  Heck, I think I talked to one person all night, and only because he seemed just so intent on being nice to me.  He tried to save my life when I got in over my head, but he was too late.  He messaged me with an in character apology for not being able to save him.  I told him that death was a part of my work, and that his help was appreciated.  And then I went mute again.
<br><br>
All I can say is, wow.  I've spent the last two weeks puttering around with my Tier'dal Cleric (Voice of Hate), roleplaying and yelling at NPCs (that's actually fun, in a way.  And it makes the other PCs nervous.)  In about 20 hours of play time, he's reached 7th level.  In just over 3 hours my warrior is 4th.  I'm guessing that if I keep playing him as a mute, non-questing, monster slaughtering cretin, I'll make 7th in one more night of play.  That's pretty fast, for me anyway.
<br><br>
Why do I bring all of this up?  Well, we've heard a lot lately about characters over 30th level, cheating and banning.  The EQ dev team announced four bannings this week.  I don't know who those people were, nor why they were banned.  I suppose if I was in a position to know, I wouldn't be able to tell you.  And it really doesn't matter to me.  You see, I know the system, and I know the folks running it.  Those four players were warned that they were doing something that could cause them to be banned from the game, and they continued to do it.  They needed to be removed.  Just because a character is high level, does not mean that they cheated to get there.
<br><br>
Now I know that some of you don't agree with some of the things that Verant would chose to ban people for.  Let's look at those things.  Banning revolves around one paying customer interfering with the enjoyment of the service of another paying customer.  It's a lot like the Constitution of the United States.  We're pretty much free to do what we want, unless we start screwing it up for others.  So that explains the restrictions on foul language, harassment and general offensiveness.  Warnings and then banning for such things seems like the obvious choice, and I don't see how anyone rationally disagree with something like that.  And I think even those that create third party 'cheat' programs understand why Verant would ban those that use them.
<br><br>
The real heated debates come up when we start talking about banning people for 'exploitation'.  Verant will warn you if you are exploiting a bug in game.  I'm not sure how many warnings you get, but after the last one, you are banned.  The arguments come in two forms.  1)  If Verant calls it a bug, then they should fix it.  It's not our job to worry about such things, and there is no reason to penalize us for their mistakes.  2)  Abusing of a bug makes the game less fun for those around you.  Let's examine both.
<br><br>
1) Verant should fix the bugs and not penalize us for them.  The logic here is that the game is now in its final version.  Anything that is in it right now is, therefore, not really a bug.  And if they want to call it a bug, then they should fix it.  It's not right that paying customers should be held responsible for knowing what is and is not a bug.  If it's in the game, I'm going to use it.
<br><br>
2) Using a bug to advance is unfair.  It rewards the cheater for cheating, while the rest of us have to work for everything we get.  It makes many players very unhappy to see others advancing faster, getting better stuff, and doing so at little or no risk to themselves.
<br><br>
Well, I agree with both of these arguments, at least in part.  First and foremost, I think less of people that abuse a bug to get ahead.  Yes, it's probably a poor way for me to see things.  But I see it that way.  But I don't go so far as to say that it ruins the game for me.  I just don't like it.  But I can play on and ignore them.  After all, there will always be someone further along than me, and most of them are not cheating, so why worry about it?  And I also understand that this is a final game, one that we are paying for.  We shouldn't have to worry about what we are allowed to do without being banned.  If it's a real big bug, Verant should get right on it and fix it.
<br><br>
So here's what I want to see.  I would like for everyone to take the moral high road and avoid using bugs whenever they see them.  And I would like to see Verant fix the big bugs right away. I won't get either.  It takes time for Verant to find and fix bugs, and not all people care to meet my moral standards.  So I just play and enjoy the game in my own way.  Slow, in-character, and with people that I like.
<br><br>
I also wanted to touch on what to look for when you think you might have found a bug.  I'm not talking about the easy to spot bugs, video glitches or broken vendors.  I'm talking about game balance bugs.  I'll make up some examples.
<br><br>
You kill a decaying skeleton.  You find five gold on it's corpse, along with a piece of small cloth armor.  WOW! you think, that's a lot of money, more than I've ever gotten off of anything that I could kill at first level.  So you go looking for decaying skels.  You kill a few more, and all of them have on some sort of cloth armor and several gold pieces.  Now you need to stop and think about what happens next.  You KNOW that finding eight to ten gold pieces in value on a first level monster is too much.  This, most likely, is a bug.  Especially if you are only finding this money on the decaying skeletons in one zone, and it's a newbie area.  The moral response is to /petition the problem (please, always send a detailed petition.  If the GMs can't get to it while you're on, they will at least have a good idea what the problem was), then use /bug to report it.  And then, well, don't kill any more decaying skeletons.  Soon enough there will be a lot of people killing them, and you will have the pleasure of feeling morally superior to them, even if your character is still struggling to make ends meet and goes hungry once in a while.  Maybe in a few days, kill another decaying skeleton and see if he drops the same loot, or ask someone that you see killing one.  If it's not fixed, report it again.  Soon enough you won't need to kill decaying skels for loot anyway, so move on.  Similar things come in the form of quests that give far too much of a reward for the work required.
<br><br>
Later on you are running away from an Orc.  You run to a certain spot, say behind a tree.  The Orc gets stuck there.  He can't reach you anymore.  So you kill him with spells.  You discover, after another attempt, that you can stick Orcs in that tree every time.  Again, report it and don't use it.  The exact same thing applies when you climb up into a spot where the monster can't reach you, but instead runs aimlessly toward you.  Monsters should be able to climb anything that you can climb.  Failure to do so is usually a bug.  There are some places in this huge world where the monster can't find the proper path to it's target.  Using those spots is considered abusing a bug.
<br><br>
If you are warned about doing these things, stop doing them.  Regardless of your stance on it, even if you think that they have no right to ban you for 'just playing the game'.  You will, eventually, get banned doing these things (and I'm happy about that).  But don't worry about it, either.  I've read posts from people that fear being banned for doing something that they did not know was exploiting a bug.  Use common sense in the first place, and you'll probably avoid all kinds of potentially bad situations.  Also, they will not ban you without warning.  So if you are warned, stop.  If your intentions are good, you'll be fine.
<br><br>
And look out Bristlebane, you've got a new mercenary for hire to deal with, and he's comin' up fast.
