<b>LANDFALL</b>

<br><br><br>
Zion's mug of spirits was drained. He set it down, wiping his lips in 
muted satisfaction. A barmaid appeared with a platter adorned with 
foaming mug flanked by a well tanned bosom. The Erudite gratefully 
accepted the ale.
<br><br>
"We had sailed into the Iceclad Ocean, driven to the foreign coast by a 
maddened sea titan who cursed us into a maelstrom. Some onboard new the 
land as Velious, I was one of them. Up to that day no one knew what had 
gone wrong. We had simply been tossed south by one hell of an ocean 
belch.
<br><br>
  Presently our drowish captain-The Overlord-had stepped from his cabin 
and surveyed the scene. On the southern horizon, bright and white in the 
midday sun was what looked like a mammoth iceberg stretching from East 
to West out of eye reach. It was quite featureless.
<br><br>
  The Overlords face was hard, even for a Dark Elf. Steam billowed from 
his nostrils into the artic air.
<br><br>
'It's cold.' He stated simply.
<br><br>
  As if to punctuate his words, a blood chilling wind rolled over the 
ship. It hit us like a slap in the face. Overlord nodded as if he had 
seen enough. He turned to the First Mate.
<br><br>
'Copper, check the inventory and outfit a party. We will make landfall 
tomorrow.'
<br><br>
With that, the Captain returned to his quarters and shut the door. The 
crew erupted in protest (they waited until Overlord was out of sight), 
Copper stood on the poopdeck gangway.
<br><br>
'Boys, I don't need this.' he said, brushing flecks of ice off his 
beard.
<br><br>
'Why in the eight hells are we <i>staying</i> here? We should turn 
around and hightail back home now!' a bald crooked tooth thug named 
Kobold protested. Most of the crew seemed to agree.  Copper shook his head and glanced at me, I was sitting on the forecastle 
railing staring out at Velious, only half listening to what was going 
on. Copper knew what I was thinking. <i>Somebody got us in this mess, 
I've seen it too many times before</i>.
<br><br>
'Boys, boys.' Copper replied (he always called the crew "his boys"), 
'I've checked our logistics, we were only half a day away from home when 
the storm hit. We had a few days of rations left and now we are 10 days 
from Antonica. Gentlemen, we are thoroughly in the shitter as they say in 
Freeport. If we head home now, the only thing that'll reach home is a 
ship full of dead and half crazed men.'
<br><br>
When Copper explained, the men listened. As the sails were moored and 
the oars extended, the First Mate joined me on the bow.
<br><br>
'Talk to me Zion.' Copper planted his aft on the railing. His burly 
demeanor seemed to make the ship pitch forward a bit. Looking out at our 
destination, he grimly tossed pieces of hailstone into ice blue sea.
<br><br>
'Never rains but it pours, eh?' I replied.
<br><br>
'Rain?' Copper glanced at the hail peppering the deck. 'We just got hit 
with the mother of all pissed off hurricanes.'
<br><br>
'Well Copper, you want to know what I'm thinking?'
<br><br>
Copper nodded, 'It's probably the obvious.'
<br><br>
'Somebody is angry at us. And not just anybody. Somebody you definitely 
<i>do not</i> want angry at you.'
<br><br>
Copper was quiet for awhile after that, then he spoke.  'Flint steered us 8 degrees off course, into the Buried Sea. That was 
where our hideout was back in the old days.'
<br><br>
'Do you remember what happened there that made the League relocate?' I 
asked.
<br><br>
'A damn Tsunami wiped out the entire southern zone. That was back in the 
Bane Wars when everything was crazy.'
<br><br>
'Thats right,' I said. I was leading to something, 'We are in a very 
peculiar area of the world.'
<br><br>
Copper caught on to my tone, 'What do you know about this area?'
<br><br>
  Another curdling breeze hit us, listing the ship slightly. It was as 
if Copper had angered something by simply asking the question. 
'Eons ago, long before any ice touched these lands, and when the oceans 
where young and boiling, the Crystal Wyrm Veeshan clawed the navel of 
Norrath, and from the wound sprang the first to walk and fly over our 
world. The High Elves called them the Wyrms in later ages, and we of 
Odus knew them as the Titans. The Fore-Beasts that gave birth to the 
races of Dragon. They ruled each other for untold ages, until Tunare 
raised the High Elves from the waters of Elizerain. And with the First 
Elves came the High Elf Empires of Illianth. The Illianides battled the 
Titans, who had rebuked the new gods that came after Veeshan. The 
haughty Titans were defeated and enslaved, and the Elven God-King Ausaar 
shackled the sea beasts the ocean floor, and froze the land dwellers in 
the nest from which they sprung, in Velious. But as time passed the 
Flame of Illianth dwindled, the sons of Ausaar returned to the sacred 
Elizerain, and the red years before the raising of men had come upon 
Norrath. During that time, some of the shackles on the sea floor 
broke--and some of the prison glaciers in the Abyss thawed. And those 
beings the crawled from hence are slow to calm and quick to anger, and 
theirs is a fury not seen since the skies of Norrath where an eternal 
crimson.'
<br><br>
Copper squinted at me quizzically, 'Zion, I trust your judgment and so 
does the captain. But what makes you think your story has anything to do 
with us?' 
<br><br>
I glanced to the side and caught a sailor sitting on the edge of the 
deck, eyes wide and unblinking--staring to the horizon. He wasn't 
wearing a cloak and was silently mumbling to himself nervously.
'Why don't you ask Denin?' I replied.
<br><br>

  '<i>Calcatrix!</i>' Denin whispered harshly, holding his bottle of ale 
in a deathgrip, 'it looked right at me!' the old pirate was pale, any 
hair he had left through his years of seafaring was gone in the last 
couple of days.
<br><br>
The crowd of pirates around his huddled form murmured amongst 
themselves. Overlord stood directly in front of him, looking grim as 
usual. I could tell by his eyes that he was thinking, searching for the 
meaning of that name, then his eyes found me.
<br><br>
My heart had leaped at the uttering of the name. I knew of Calcatrix.
'Calcatrix is a Gnomish name meaning "The Chariot"' I said, the pirates 
all turned to me. 
<br><br>
'After the Titans where defeated by the First Elves, Calcatrix and his 
brothers were enslaved by Ausaar and chained to entire seagoing fleets. 
They were the work horses of the High Elves, drawing the vessels at 
fantastic speeds over the waters. In later ages when Calcatrix's masters 
were no more, he escaped from his prison in the Blue Divide. That was 
quite a long while ago.'
<br><br>
Overlord looked back at Denin, who shivered and bowed his head.
"I think I pissed him off...sir."
<br><br>
Overlord had a way of swearing without saying a word, and with that he 
looked back out at the ice encrusted ocean.
<br><br>
"When the ice is thick enough to be safe to walk on, we hike it to the 
land proper. I want us off the water as soon as possible."
<br><br>
Overlord believed us safer with the peril of Velious then with the peril 
of Calcatrix. We did not know that by that time the next day, we would 
know he was quite wrong."
<br><br>

Outside the tavern, a deep thunder lolled in the distance. Candles 
flickered. It seemed like the evil of the tale had followed Zion and was 
listening somewhere out in the far reaches of the Sea. Zion noted and 
empty chair by the bar.
<br><br>
"That old chair, perhaps I might have held our old comrade Inwo had 
things not gone awry? But the poor fellow perished, and was but the 
first of many who would on the wretched frozen isle. We made landfall 
that afternoon, trekking across a vast icesheet that crowned the coast 
of Velious. There was no life to be seen. Not a bird or even a polar 
bear. That dismayed us since we need furs and meat. Then the sun went 
down. We thought we knew cold before, now we were in great peril of not 
surviving till morning. Our good wizard Muiy was sleeping fitfully in 
Freeport, and we were hard to start a fire without him. We lasted a 
quiet, cold, fretful night. We rested as best we could, but little did 
we know that the coming day had some extraordinary things in store for 
us..."
