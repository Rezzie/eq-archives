Welcome to Rivervale, City of Halflings. Here we find a pleasantly unique role-playing environment, although the race itself carries inheritance from other classic RPG references such as The Lord of the Rings. It would be difficult to create a role for a Halfling without inheriting some of this history, but the first step to breaking away from the predefined roles can be an easy one. Looking at the Rivervale communities, there are three main social organizations that make up the majority of the community. 
<br><br>
The first thing I notice is the lack of University or Modern Schooling. What they have instead is a very strong Clerical and Druidic farming community. This seems to suggest that they are old fashioned, and opposed to the rapid growth and advancements of big city life. These Halflings would be solid, stoic farmer types who typically distrust the ways of modern society. Without borrowing from classical literature it is still safe to say that the farming community of Rivervale would be opposed to change and not likely to get up and leave home for adventure or conquest. Yet it still happens, as there is always a noble cause calling to these normally docile Halflings that brings them out into the world.
<br><br>
Looking further into the community in Rivervale one finds a strong sense of independence. Halflings have their own breed of law enforcement that reaches all the way to Neriak where they combat the Dark Elves. These brave Halflings are called Deputies, and they travel far and wide to protect their kin. Much closer to home are the Goblins or RunnyEye, which are hell-bent on destroying Rivervale and nearby HighHold. The Deputies do battle with all this and more in their never-ending quest for peace. The image itself of the Deputy NPC lends to a cowboy law-dog impression, and the cultural makeup of Halflings goes further to suggest that image.
<br><br>
	The Third facet of the community is the family-structured Rogues faction, made up primarily of Bristlebane followers. These tricksters, rogues and merry-makers collectively might be the largest group of Bristlebane followers in any one place in Norrath. Never was there a party like a Halfling's party, and never will one find more beer and laughter than in the Fool's Gold Inn. They love their food and to gamble, and they love comfort. 
<br><br>
	The Halflings of Norrath have a uniquely diverse culture unlike that of most other races except humans. Here we have farming druids of Karana who harbor peace, warrior-poet Deputy law enforcement and happy-go-lucky Bristlebane followers. It reminds me of a feudal-communistic patriarchal structure of sons following their fathers, and unions of allied trades forming subsets within the greater community. Each subset would be self sufficient of the next, while lead by common or allied leaders. Through observation of this cultural makeup we can start to imagine what might motivate a Halfling to take up a life of adventure and fame. What is your motivation to leave home? 
<br><br>
When you consider rationalizations common to any race, many of them would apply just the same to a Halfling. Perhaps you have ties to a band or guild whose charter and dedication calls for a life of travel to uphold justice, or teach the ways of Karana or Brell. Perhaps you were spurred by the threat of Goblins to crush evil elsewhere in the world. You take with you the way of the Deputy, forever a ronin cowboy. Or perhaps a peacekeeper, or travelling scholar and storyteller. No matter the reason, your Halfling unless mentally ill would value comfort and fun, as it is their nature.
<br><br>
Once you have the basic questions you would ask creating any character, consider the role you take when leaving home. Why did I move to the big city and leave comfort of home? Also keep in mind your sense of humor. There are no end to those who would make fun at your height and furry feet. Surely a Halfling hero would have a good sense of humor, or at least a good retort to the usual canned jeers. 
<br><br>
Lastly as always, research the factions in Rivervale and the surrounding regions to find what you can about in-game RPG element and factions. These will help you shape your role. Ask other popular Halfling role-players what it was for them that led them to leave home. After all, there could be no greater hero or inspiration than a player, and no better justification for your cause than a real story to be told.
