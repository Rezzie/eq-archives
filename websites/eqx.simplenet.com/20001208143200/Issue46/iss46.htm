	The darkness was intruding, cold, in the fog. Tricks of the light and fog sent images of creatures stalking his forebrain, which in turn sent ripples up his spine. With a wry shake of the head and a lopsided grin, Jared shrugged it off and continued to walk towards the cathedral. Tonight was a good night, a night of joy - why was he then thinking of monsters and ghouls right out of childhood nightmare? He didn't know, and with another grin that quickly turned into a soft chuckle, he picked up the pace.

Aye, that's me.  I'm a gravedigger.  Been one since as long as I can recall.  Well, that's not entirely true, I was a young kid once.  Don't remember what I did then.  But ever since I started working, I've been a gravedigger.
<br><br>
Good at my job, I am.  Forty years I've been a gravedigger and now I'm the chief gravedigger of Cabbot.  Cabbot's a small city in eastern Karana, a small city with a lot of graves.  You see, the people of Cabbot don't live very long.  In between the ogre raids and the passing plagues, we have a lot of deaths.  That's not a problem though, it keeps me busy.

	It was his hunger for power that placed him in this horrible plight, he realized as he hid behind a pile of rubble from a ruined wall.  He had let himself become overeager for power and wealth and now he realized that he might end up paying the final price for his lack of wisdom.  Sadly Xar, a young necromancer, let his thoughts drift back to the events preceding this night as the liche's minions searched through the ruined tower around him.

Paladriel of Fay restrung his precious oaken bow as he lay pressed against the green grasses of the rolling Rathian bluffs. Testing the horsehairs with a harmonic pluck, he was satisfied with his weapon and lay it carefully beside him as he glanced to the east across the barren breast of southern Antonica. The ranger pleated his brows in his usual halcyon expression. Bright blue eyes slowly observed their surroundings; a long, thin nose was flared and pinkish in the cold night air<b>...</b>

Until age twelve I lived in a fairly small town outside of Parkersburge, West Virginia. It was a thirty-minute drive from downtown.  Actually it was called an addition, Mattheny addition.  I'd be surprised if you found more than fifty houses in that neighborhood.  Once you entered the addition there were three roads you could travel, each road not more than five hundred yards.

The wiry elven ranger crawled to the top of the hill and carefully peeked
over the top, then turned and furtively gestured for his companion to
follow.  Significantly less agile, the old wizard made his way to the top of
the hill and looked over it's crest at the carnage spread about the road.

My daughter, Bethany, has taken up playing EQ with me. She really loves the
game, and since it is so lifelike and immersive she sometimes gets
completely oblivious to the fact that it's happening on the computer and not
real (sound like anyone YOU know?).

Oh, that’s a toughy.  Seeing as how EverQuest has this non-disclosure agreement we don’t even know who the authorities are on that part of things. But as an observer here’s my best comparison.  Scoring is 1 pt for a yes answer…

With the first parry he saw three more approaching from the left and another group from the right<b>...</b>
