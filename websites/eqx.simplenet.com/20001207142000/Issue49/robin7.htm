	As the party began to break camp the next morning, Oghma pondered Beldro's story.  He knew that though the dark elves were master liars, every lie has in it a bit of truth.  Beldro's tale of the theft was plausible, though some of it was a bit boastful, as the dark elves reveled in outwitting each other.  Oghma sometimes thought that if the dark elves would stop warring on each other, they would take over the world.  It was also reasonable to assume that the dark elf clan the book was stolen from was hunting down the thief.  Loss of face was, in dark elf society, a painful blow to a clan and the restoration of that clan's prestige was of the utmost importance.
<br><br>
	What puzzled Oghma the most was Beldro's motive for stealing the book.  Part of it was of course the power obtainable by the acquisition of a necromantic tome, part of it was the act of embarrassing the clan stolen from, since it was likely Beldro and Zasstryn's stock had just risen in dark elf society, but there was something else.  Beldro recruited Zasstryn for his skills, but there was perhaps another reason he had made an alliance with that rogue.
<br><br>
	Oghma had noticed Beldro copying down pages from the book last night.  Why would he copy and not study the pages?  Oghma thought back about what he had heard of necromantic tomes in general.  He knew some of them carried powerful curses that caused wasting diseases, or attracted the attention of the more powerful denizens of the undead world, perhaps even a demon.  Some detailed a method of obtaining immortality through the necromantic resurrection of one's own corpse.  Could there be a side-effect that this tome possesses that is useful to Beldro, beside the spells available in it?
<br><br>
	"Beldro?" asked Oghma.  "Don't a lot of those books have curses on them?  I mean, aren't you taking a risk by even carrying it?"
<br><br>
	"No," boasted Beldro. "Dark elves are immune to the curse embodied in this book. All other races will be cursed as soon as they open the book."
<br><br>
	"What's the curse?" asked Oghma.
<br><br>
	Eyes narrowed, Beldro looked at Oghma "Seven years bad luck," he said.
<br><br>
	Oghma nodded, secretly elated.  That was the key! Beldro wanted to keep from everyone the true effect of the tome on non-Tier'dal individuals.  Seven years bad luck, indeed. "That's a curse no one would want," Oghma agreed.  "Who wrote this tome?  I'm curious, because I like the study of knowledge in general.  Was it a dark elf?"
<br><br>
	"It was a dark elf, the mighty Uesin," replied Beldro.  "He was once the strongest necromancer in the world, and few now rival his powers at their peak."
<br><br>
	"Was there anything he was known for?  Something specific, perhaps?"
<br><br>
	"He was a master at draining life from the living," said Beldro, glancing at the dwarf.  "Why, are you thinking of becoming a necromancer?  Or perhaps you wish to steal this tome from me?"  Beldro grinned evilly.
<br><br>
	"Ugh, no, you can play with your dead bodies all you want.  It's life and the living that I care about most," Oghma grimaced.  Looking around, he saw that the party was up and ready to go. "Where are you headed to now?" he asked the dark elves.
<br><br>
	Zasstryn and Beldro looked at each other. "We're headed to High Hold, then down to Grobb, said Zasstryn.  "Want to come?" Zasstryn snickered.
<br><br>
	"No, thanks!"  Oghma chuckled. "I'd be just so much meat to kill in that town.  You go play with your Ogre buddies."
<br><br>
	Oghma watched the two set off to the east. Two dark figures bundled, not against the cold, but against the light of day.  He imagined that they would find a cool cave before long to sleep in, and then begin traveling by night, as did all dark elves.
<br><br>
	Mundas approached Oghma. "Well, did you find anything out?  I wonder how you can stand talking to those two, they are so mean and evil looking, but they have really nice cloaks, the kind with just a little gold fringe, and red, really bright red, I like bright red."
<br><br>
	"Gather around folks, I'm out of ideas," Oghma said.
<br><br>
	Elaan laughed.  "You, out of ideas?  That's about as likely as you being quiet for more than three minutes."
<br><br>
	Amlaith chuckled.
<br><br>
	"Right, thanks Elaan."  Oghma smiled wryly.  He related his conversation with Beldro to the group, filling them in on Beldro's boasting and his evasiveness about the tome's powers. "So, does anyone have any thoughts?"
<br><br>
	Elaan cleared his throat. "I heard some things about life draining from my guild master.  It is said that some can drain life and absorb it into their own, and some can slow it to a mere trickle and slowly sap the life out of a person until they are dead, sometimes taking weeks, even months."
<br><br>
	Mundas added, "I've heard of this Uesin, he knew ways to control people by making them feel better while still draining the life out of him.  There was a necromancer in my village, he was really really tall, almost three feet, and always smelled like rotting dirt, he was kind of stinky and lived outside of town in this hut, really, near the graveyard…"
<br><br>
	"The point, Mundas?" Oghma asked.
<br><br>
	"Oh, right! Well, he talked about drugs that could mask life-draining, so that the person would feel better for a bit, and then when there was no drug, they would feel much worse, though, and then need more of the drug."
<br><br>
	"Zasstryn's an assassin."  Amlaith spoke.
<br><br>
	"So if we add all this together, we have a tome whose powers may include life-drain, a dark elf assassin, and the potential ability to control someone through drugs as they die slowly."  Oghma pondered.  "Who would be a good target for such an attack, one who you would need to control before death?"
<br><br>
	"A ruler of some sort?" Amlaith asked, interested.
<br><br>
	"A very wealthy man?" added Elaan.
<br><br>
	"A powerful mage, so that Beldro could force him to teach his skills or give him his spells?"  Oghma thought out loud.  "They said they were headed out to High Hold, and assuming that was true, I've heard there was corruption in the High Hold military.  That might be a target, since so much money passes through there."
<br><br>
	"I doubt a dark elf could get so close to a king or ruler of a large nation, but High Hold sounds about right," Elaan mused.  "Perhaps Beldro is looking for pure profit here, and not some dark way of advancing evil."
<br><br>
	"Well, what can we do about it?" Mundas asked. 'I mean how can we stop them, or do we want to?  Does it really matter if Beldro makes some money off of corrupt officers?"
<br><br>
	"It does matter if Beldro has control over someone important.  It's then more a danger, since Beldro could lead an army through High Hold, if he had access to it.  With the prestige recently earned, his clan may have the pull to get enough dark elves to take over High Hold."
<br><br>
	"What if that trip to Grobb is a recruiting trip?  He could find an army there easily!"  Elaan said worriedly. "An army of ogres and inkies, all going through High Hold?  It's a strategic place, too, don't forget.  It threatens many cities, Rivervale, Qeynos, Freeport.  The pass is the way to get to all those cities."
<br><br>
	"We have to stop him!" cried Mundas.  "But how?"
<br><br>
	"The trip to Oggok may be a lie, or a misdirection.  But we had better be prepared! Let's look at our assets - we can track them, with Banner and Amlaith," Oghma surmised.  "The magical aspect has to be taken care of by Mundas and I, and Elaan will have to deal with whatever undead they throw at us, and we'll have to fight Zasstryn too.  Those two will not make it easy, however, they are very cunning."
<br><br>
	"Wait!" Mundas began rummaging in his sack.  "I've got something that will do the trick!  It's in here somewhere."
<br><br>
	The party looked on with interest as a random assortment of objects came out of Mundas's pack.  A mixing bowl, a small, star-shaped fruit, an outrageous fuschia feathered hat, and a hill giant-sized boot were added to the growing pile at Mundas' feet.
<br><br>
	"How does all the junk fit in there?" Elaan wondered. "Next he'll pull out a saddle and a horse to go with it!"
<br><br>
	Mundas squealed in triumph. "I got it! He reached into his pack and pulled out….
