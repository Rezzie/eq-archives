    a debate briefly sparked in the everquest newsgroup a little while ago about dragons in
    everquest.&nbsp; I will summarize for you what I believe the results were.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; After much debate, the Bill spoke out.&nbsp; They are not currently planning
    to have dragons as PCs, and at most have a lukewarm feeling for the idea.&nbsp; They do,
    however, plan to make some draconic monsters. <br>
    <br>
    Here is a reprint of some storyline on the <a href="http://www.everquest.com/fr_almanac.htm">EverQuest homepage</a>:&nbsp; <br>

    THE FIRST AGE: DARKNESS AND DRAGONS<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; It is rumored amongst most of the intelligent races of Norrath that first
    came the Dragons. Whether this is fact or Dragonkind propaganda is not important, for
    which is more vital, the truth or what the truth is believed to be? It is said that
    thousands of years ago the world known as Norrath was &quot;noticed&quot; by Veeshan, the
    great Crystalline Dragon who rules the Plane of Sky. Pleased with the conditions on
    Norrath, Veeshan deposited her brood onto the frozen continent of Velious.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Then, with one swipe of her mighty claws, Veeshan opened several great </span><br>

    <span style="text-align: justify">wounds on the surface of Norrath, thus staking her claim
    to this promising new world.<br>
    </span><p>I will make an attempt to analyze:<br>
    <br>
    Apparently, dragons were first to come to the world, as these histories that declare
    themselves as rumours are almost always true, else people would not bother to repeat it
    (most cases).&nbsp; The mention of&nbsp; &quot;Dragonkind propaganda&quot; seems to
    indicate that &quot;pure&quot; dragons are an intelligent, sentient race.&nbsp; The fact
    that dragons were the first to come here also seems to indicate that dragons will be very
    powerful, and very rare.&nbsp; From posts however, I have gotten the impression that there
    will be many lesser dracoforms to mercilessily slaughter.&nbsp; Dragons, however, seem
    more the type to either neogotiate with or have incredibily boring and drawn out battles
    with if you're foolhardy enough.&nbsp; Hopefully, they will be a high AI race that you can
    ally with.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that Veeshan marked Velious with her claw seems to
    indicate that (a) dragon(s) will be present there, most likely a good deal more powerful
    than elsewhere.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Some items open to speculation:&nbsp; will dragons have claimed territorities, or will
    &nbsp;&nbsp; they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wander?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will&nbsp;&nbsp; they&nbsp; be <br>

    with a level of interactivity other than see it-kill it (Bill seemed to indicate that they
    would)? What about dracoforms (serpents, hydras, etc.)?&nbsp; Do dragons continue to
    influence the worldplot of Norrath today?&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Are there any dragons that maintain a power structure and plot, or are they confined
    within the range of solitary to small groups?</p>
    <p>Being as biased in favor of dragons as I am, I can simply hope that the EQ team will
    make the dragon an intriguing creature, at least as much as humans and humanoids and
    hopefully more.<br>
