I logged out last night with a feeling of disquiet.
<br><br>
I've always been a casual role-player.  I'm not much for thees and thous, nor am I a big fan of constantly monitoring in and out of character speech.  I figure that most folks know which is which, and while I try to keep all my says in character, group talk and tells are often out of character.  In that sense, I guess, I'm not much of a role-player.
<br><br>
Where I do well in role-playing is making a character concept.  Almost all my characters have a personality, a raison d'être, and some sort of self-imposed limitations.  An ogre warrior might constantly pick up the next weapon because he always thinks it's better than his last, even though it's rusty.  A wood-elf druid might always aid a passerby, whether they need it or not, no matter how much mana she's got.  If I took the time, I could write a coherent, internally consistent biography for all my characters. When it comes to taking a concept and playing within it, I think I do pretty well.
<br><br>
While playing Oghma, though, I recently took a big step outside my persona, and I'm not sure I like it, or how to recover from it.
<br><br>
As a semi-public figure, Oghma is both a persona and a "person".  I often get tells and hello's from people who have read me in print somewhere, and often have nice experiences.  I often group up with folks and play together, though I'll admit to disbanding from groups who are not in good control of themselves and risk getting me killed.
<br><br>
As often happens, someone I played with advanced their character quite a bit faster than Oghma did (I'm cursed with 4 mid level characters and not a single high level one), and wound up coming back to Faydwer.  I gave them a tell from another character, saying hello.  We chatted a while and talked about starting up other characters and playing together.
<br><br>
In the course of this, he offered me some nice items that he had gotten from his travels and was no longer using, or able to get again quite easily.  It was quite a generous offer, and we discussed which items should go to which characters.  And I think this is where I took a left turn somewhere…
<br><br>
Oghma has always been more of a giver than a taker, but recently he got an item from another high level character and now all of a sudden I feel like Oghma is getting to be a beggar. He's gone from the wise old dwarf now to something I'm not sure I like, and I need to reclaim his personality.  I tried to back out of the deal while it was happening, but then found that they had gotten an item especially for me, so turning it down would have been wrong.  Now I am twinked about 5-10 levels above what I should have, which isn't horrible since it's only one item, but I'm disappointed in him.
<br><br>
I think it must be the love of magic that made Oghma flip over to the greedy side of dwarvishness which he so dislikes.  Oghma has always been a recorder and teller of tales, trying to be the living embodiment of dwarven culture and history (I know it sounds a little grandiose, but hey, that's Oghie), and the same time showing the world that not all dwarves are greedy haters of elves.  Oghma, always spiritual, has gotten his soul a bit grubby.  
<br><br>
As a priest of Brell, I guess he would pray for forgiveness and try to understand himself better.  Give up the item?  What would Brell want me to do?  I may be better able to serve him with it…
