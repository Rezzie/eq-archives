After careful consideration I have decided to cover a subject that affects everyone, guilds and how they interact both internally and externally. Recently I have heard people complaining about things such as maturity levels of the members, organization and activity of the guild and others such factors.  I am not sure if this is due to the quality of the guilds out there, the quality of the potential members, or just the fact that good online gaming guilds are hard to come by.  I will try to elaborate on some of the problems I see, give a general synopsis of what I feel a guild is, and also tell you the story of how I decided to join a guild.
<br><br>
For those of you looking for a guild, depending on your reasons for doing so, there are many factors to consider before pledging your allegiance.  The first and foremost is the quality of the members.  Every guild gets it's rotten egg, so I am sure that no guild out there is perfect, but the guilds that have a lot of rotten eggs are the ones to look out for.  How to look for this is the question at hand.  How can you tell what the members will be like?  Simple enough, most guilds use many forms of communication including IRC and ICQ.  Through multitudes of in depth conversations with members you will be able to assess if they have the same interests as you do and also ascertain whether or not they will fit your playstyle.
<br><br>
Another problem with guilds is finding one with members that are going to be playing on your server of choice and that will be online at the same time as you.  What purpose is there in joining a guild that will be separated between many servers and have members that all have different online schedules?  You are joining a guild in order to have the support of that guild in-game, so you will want to confer with the members to determine the members schedules and also find out if they are willing to find one server and stick to it.
<br><br>
	Now on to one of the biggest problems.  Is that guild's philosophy the same as yours?  You surely wouldn't want to join a guild of player killers, when you yourself are against player killing.  Another issue is that of whether the guild will role-play or power game, or both (read my <a href="../Issue28/power.htm">previous article</a> on that subject.)  Do you want to just sit in a tavern and drink ale with your guild members, acting in character completely, or would you rather just go kill anything in site to gain experience and raise your level, or a combination of both?  What if you are an adventurous heart and the guild you are joining is more like an army?  That surely wouldn't fit into your agenda!  Another thing to think about is that of whether or not the guild isn't friendly towards other guilds causing wars and possibly ostracizing you from the rest of the community.  Consideration of all principles of a guild are key in having a successful relationship with that organization.
<br><br>
	Those are some of the major considerations when joining a guild.  There are some other minor ones that may only apply to your preferences, but after a long time of talking with the guilds out there, I know that they are more than welcome to elaborate on any questions you may have.  It may seem like a huge task to find a home for your online character, but taking the time is well worth it when you consider the problems associated with joining a bad guild.
<br><br>
	Now I will tell you my feelings on guilds, what is important to not only the members but to the people running them.  The most important quality of a guild in my mind is the members.  If you cannot befriend the members and be able to have a good time with them in and out of the game, then there will only be problems.  Not everyone in a guild has the same exact interests, but as long as you share some and can talk about those in particular then you should be ok.  Without a common bond friendship is hard to establish, and after seeing so many guilds fall apart, I have realized that friendship is the only thing that will keep a guild running smoothly, because when you are friends the guild runs itself.
<br><br>
	In my opinion guilds are not an organization you join to further yourself, they are a group of individuals that you enjoy playing with.  Joining a guild to obtain status, wealth or power is plain ignorant.  A guild is something that goes above that, something where the people gather to accomplish a goal, or to just have fun.  Hell, your goal could be to just have fun, or it could be to rid the world of player killers, or to sit in the tavern and drink way too much ale.  Never use a guild as a way of making yourself feel important, it just won't work for you or the other members.
<br><br>
	When you are involved in running a guild there are a lot of things some of the members don't understand or just don't care about.  I think you should involve the members in the workings of running the guild, in case you are absent for a period of time, or just to make them feel like they are important.  This in time will make the unity of your guild stronger.  I don't believe that one person should have to run a guild all by himself, it would send him to his grave.  Have all the members involved in one way or another.  Be it through a structure of some sort, or just duties that they as guild members need to perform for the sake of their brethren.  People like to feel important, and if you make them feel important, than they will respect you even more.
<br><br>
	My last feeling on guilds is that of lasting quality.  I personally think if you find a group of people that you identify with and have a good time with that you should make sure that your guild transcends games.  Be it switching from Ultima Online to EverQuest, or playing Starcraft or Myth when your server is down.  There is no need to limit your guild to one game, and if you can play other games together than you know you have something going for you.  You don't even need to change the name of the guild, you can continue to use it, unless of course your guild is named after a portion of the game you created it for.
<br><br>
	Now to tell you how I became involved with a guild.  I will try to make this as brief as possible and will refrain from using the name of my guild or the members names.  This is just an example of how a guild can benefit you and how you can benefit a guild.  This took place in the first week or so of the full release of Ultima Online.
<br><br>
	I had searched for a guild for a few weeks before the release of UO just for something to do.  I knew deep down in my heart that I was a loner, an adventurer that didn't want any strict rules, dues, or agendas.  So I didn't join any organizations and spent my time wandering around, looking for adventure.  I did my fair share of dying, but was still doing ok without the support of others.
<br><br>
	Then one day something happened.  I was hunting in the woods when a huge troll came barreling towards me, hungry for my blood.  I wasn't a very powerful warrior at the time and was ill equipped to take on such a behemoth.  I ran for quite a ways, troll hot on my trail, when I saw a man ride up on a horse, dressed in battle gear and wearing a blue robe with a green cape.  He asked me if I was in need of help, and I of course accepted.  
<br><br>
	We attacked the troll head on; the battle was long and took a lot out of my savior.  He fell underneath the troll's huge axe, he died to try and save me.  This affected me, I knew that I could not let his death go unavenged.  I circled the troll for a good ten minutes, trying to figure out the best battle plan, and meanwhile guarding the fallen knight's corpse.  To my surprise, the knight returns having been raised from the dead by a healer, which I had seen none for miles, and started to grab his belongings.  He was surprised that I did not loot his corpse and head for the hills.  He drank a few healing potions he had with him and jumped right back into the battle.  We slew the wretched troll and divvied up the loot.  
<br><br>
	This is when I knew that I had made a life long friend.  He offered to give me a reward for guarding his belongings, which I refused.  He mentioned the name of his guild and offered to introduce me to the rest of the members, but I declined, informing him that I was a loner.  We parted ways and said our good-byes, both wishing each other the best of luck.  
<br><br>
	Nearly two weeks later we met again.  He was hunting in the same area I was with a few of his guildmates.  He recognized me and we chatted for awhile.  My interest in his organization grew and I agreed to visit his home and meet with his leader.  During this meeting the philosophies of the guild were described to me, and surprisingly enough, they were really close to mine.  I decided to enlist with them and give up my wandering to become a part of their organization.
<br><br>
	I pretty much was free to be the wanderer I was born to be still, but could choose to adventure with them if I wanted to.  They didn't ask me for money, didn't require me to follow any orders, and left me free to do what I wanted to.  I quickly fell in love with the guild, never having brotherhood like that in any other game.  We were friends that played, had a good time, and helped each other out.  There wasn't any greed involved at all.  
<br><br>
	That is my story, and my guild has stuck together for the most part and we are making the transition into Norrath.  The key elements to success in a guild are completely subjective.  In my eyes though, a guild will fail if the members can not be friends.  Others think a structure is necessary, but I don't believe it is as long as you have quality members.  I will close by stating that this is all in my opinion based on observations I have made in more than one game.  I am sure that many will disagree with the statements I have made, but I hope that more will agree with it.  The more that agree with it, the better guilds we will see in EverQuest!
