Dusk.
<br><br>
The triumph of darkness over the retreating light. The passing of lights influence over the land. When the balance between good and evil begins its shift.
<br><br>
Soon shadows will populate the grounds, multiplying with each heartbeat. Darkness will once again triumph over the weakening light, releasing the servants of night.
<br><br>
And so they come. Seduced by the twilight's dance. For the ritual necessitates those that carry the nourishment of darkness. They surround me and I feel the darkness begin to envelop me.
<br><br>
Thus does the darkness replenish me... reconciling the evil in some blasphemous parody of photosynthesis. Transforming the unsettling into something unholy.
<br><br>
The dance is one I know well. How exhilarating, the sounds of their eager approach as evils children spring forth! Anticipating the moment of the sun's banishment.
<br><br>
The creatures of the dark. A blood moon. The soil itself. All bring forth the dark cache of evil to me. And so I feed, in a demanding ritual of slathering hell-blood spilt upon my form of darkness, gasping in the rush of its evil stimulation. My body climaxes, the orgasmic wrenching shooting agony through me.
<br><br>
I think of all those who have tried to control evil. To find it's hidden secrets. But these are but fools for the secrets are eternal. Laid before our eyes every day. Every night. Their meaning is impossible to grasp. So they reach for lucid thoughts, those that will calm them and bring comfort.
<br><br>
I turn myself and look at the entrance to Neriak. A smile smears across my face. I revel in the fact that most of it lays beneath the ground.  Not long ago I had been taught that in the absence of sunlight dwells evil, and the greatest evil lives below... underground, in eternal blackness. Underground where madness reigns. Where the gods' (of light) grace is forbidden.
<br><br>
Forever.
<br><br>
I sit upon the ground and think of the tales all the other young Teir'Dal are speaking of. A Battle for the Book they call it, in Freeport. The Blood Coven was the driving force and, of course, the Teir'Dal were victorious.
<br><br>
As the darkness fills me, I try again to think of my past... All I can remember is the last few weeks. And that is sporadic at best. I remember talking to the daydweller Ordieth as he touched my mind... I remember seeing the Teir'Dal warrior named Datal who appeared to know me... I remember seeing the kindly woman Svart of the Coven who gave me a doll even though she did not know who I am.
<br><br>
But there are days in-between that that I remember nothing of. One day I would fall asleep next to a tree in the Nektulos forest and the next I am back in Neriak. But it isn't the next day. It is days later. And I am dressed different. And my body is sore as if I had taken a long trek.
<br><br>
But that cannot be, I know how to gate myself back... but my body aches just the same. And I cannot remember anything of those days.
<br><br>
Just terrible dreams. Dreams of three... hags... dreams of cats... dreams of the mountains and the plains...
<br><br>
My head throbs in pain as I try to remember more! I can do nothing but put my hands to the side of my head and scream in pain! But it doesn't stop!
<br><br>
I get up and run into Neriak... run past the Priest of Discord... past the bank... all the way to the Church itself. 
<br><br>
I make it to the Church of the Spires of Innoruuk (the Great Church of the Teir'Dal people). It is the original Church, the brotherhood which all Clerics of Innoruuk are born into. It is the extension of Innoruuk's power on this world.
<br><br>
Once inside it's walls, I say my little prayer:
<br><br>
"My mouth is the Mouth of Innoruuk. The Children shall not stray, the body shall not fail in His service. "
<br><br>
As I sit in the Church, the pain seems to subside. I stand up and speak of things I should not know. I have never seen my teacher for training. I know many things I should not and I cannot recall from where I learned them. The only things I can recall learning is to use a weapon or to learn to tailor my own armor. But always when I do such things, there is a little voice in the back of my head... voices, actually.  Telling me that I do not need to learn such things. Voices I know... voices I have dreamed of.
<br><br>
I try to recall my mother's face... but all I can see is blood. My father... well, most Teir'Dal do not know their father. But I know my Father well, for he is the Father of all Teir'Dal. It is to him I turn to. I wish I knew my mother, though. Perhaps she is one of the skeletons the Necromancers use...
<br><br>
Again, the voices assault me!  They do not wish me to think of my mother… of my past.  Their screams echo inside my head.  I have learned of one way to cease these voices.  I stand before the empty room and let the words begin to flow through me.  I am unsure how I learned them or why I speak them with such conviction…
<br><br>
"Listen to my words, for my mouth is the Mouth of Innoruuk. 
<br><br>
"In the time that all was dark, Veeshan, the Winged Mother, came upon this world while hunting. She saw that it was rich and promising, and would nurture her great children, and so here laid her eggs. 
<br><br>
"Hail the Name of the Winged Mother! 
<br><br>
"The Creeping Coward Brell Serilis discovered her nest, and through treacherous cunning made pacts with the other gods to steal the world from the Winged Mother. 
<br><br>
"Curse the Name of the Creeping Coward! 
<br><br>
"The gods in their council said 'Let us not speak of this to Innoruuk, for He is great, but by trickery we may have what is rightfully his, as well.'
<br><br>
"Revile the False Council of Gods! 
<br><br>
"Then the gods covered the world with their worms, and these worms crawled to all the corners of the world, and grew into the Others. 
<br><br>
"Hate the Children of Lying Gods! 
<br><br>
"But Our Father could not be deceived, nor can He be thwarted. 
<br><br>
"Praise the Will of Innoruuk! 
<br><br>
"He took for His own the first Queen and King of all the Elves from their thrones at Takish-Hiz. He led them from Tunare, the False Mother.  He lifted them from their ignorance and showed them His Will. 
<br><br>
"Bow to the Name of the Eternal Queen and King!
<br><br>
"We are their children. We are the instruments of Our Father's Will. We shall destroy the offspring of the false gods and cleanse the world of their treachery. We will deliver this world to Our Father. 
<br><br>
"Strive for the Day of Darkening!"
<br><br>
My head is again my own. I grab my staff and the doll I have named Hope (I know I am too old for such things... but I feel as if I was just born. I have no memories of my own). I gate outside and see a shadow wolf walking by. It is time for a new gorget, I think as I feel the power of furor rush to my hands...
