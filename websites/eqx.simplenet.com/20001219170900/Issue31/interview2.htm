<p style="text-align: justify">
Well here is the first of my many interviews of folks from the EQ Community that I have planned for EQ Express.  My first subject is Kunzite, High Wizard of the Tower of Sorcery, and he had a lot of things to say.  I hope you all enjoy!
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Greetings Kunzite! Are you ready to start?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ok!
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  There are quite a few EQ fans that will read this article.   I'm sure those readers would like to know a little about you.  Give us some background on your profession, education and hobbies?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Well, I don't have a profession, because I'm in my last year of high school.  That also covers education...
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And your hobbies?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hobbies...  Hmm...  Well, I play computer games....  And I play RPG's...  Not much else...
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hehe, that is ok, pretty much a diehard RPG fan then?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yes.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  How do you feel about guilds?  Do you plan to join one?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm basically ambivalent.  I don't plan to join one at the time, at least.  I am, however, in a general gaming guild, and most of us will be playing EQ, the Adventurer's Guild.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ok!  On to the next question.  Do you feel EQ will live up to the name its fans are creating for it?  Why?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No.  As with most games of this type, the fans make more out of the game than it actually is.  As I look at message boards these days, and for the past 8 months, I notice that the people expect far too much out of this game.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Really... That is understandable, but we can only hope that the beta testers will make it a game that will be suitable for all...
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The game will be good, and I believe it will be better than any other game at this time, however, it will not meet our expectations.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you had just one wish.  One thing you would like to see included in EQ.  What would it be?  Why?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hmm...  That's a tough one.  Probably spell research.  I want to see mages able to research spells, not merely find them.  For the research system, I want to see something interesting that can maintain a person's interest for a long time, while simulating "real" spell research.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Interesting answer.  I am sure that would be a great addition to the game.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Do you feel that in an RPG setting that people should have vast character backgrounds? I have noticed quite a few have taken the time to write histories and dispositions for their characters. Do you condone this activity, or do you find it extreme? 
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I very much agree with this.  It is not necessary, but I do find that a character with a background, and especially one who has been played before (and thus has a predetermined personality) is a much more believable character than one without any solid background. Also, I find that a lot of characters without a background, when asked, seem to fall into the "default character background" of RPG's: My village was destroyed by [insert monster], and I was the only survivor, blah, blah.  One can gather from this that at one time the world must have been a *very* populous place...
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I remember my very first character background, kinda read just like that. Hehe...
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  What type of history do you have with RPGs in general? How many pen and paper games have you played?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My experience lies mostly in AD&D.  Though I have dabbled in others, I play mostly AD&D.  I've been doing so for the past 5 years, as much as I can.  I've been playing CRPG's for about 7 years now.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  How long have you been a member of the EQ community? I know that I have been researching this game since mid-December and am just curious to see who else has been drooling over this game for 6+ months.
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I first heard of EQ in September.  I wasn't highly involved in it until... sometime in December, I believe - when EQ Vault opened.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I was too busy playing that "other" game in September, but finally was exposed to EverQuest in December.  Haven't thought about anything else since.  *smiles*
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  From what you have read about the game, how do you feel the party system is going to work? And what do you feel will be the best possible combination for a party?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The party system looks like it's going to work, in my opinion.  A good party for general adventuring, hmm...  That would probably consist of 2 Paladins/ShadowKnights (interchangeable), a Rogue, a Wizard, a Cleric, and a Magician, or a Necromancer.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pretty good combo there.  Can't wait to see how it will work!
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  There has always been a huge debate over the pvp switch. What are your concerns regarding this topic and which side of the switch will you reside?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I believe the switch is an excellent idea.  The removal of PvP from the game for those who wish to go without is a great step in making this a better RPG - as long as it is properly explained within the game.  I will probably be, as many others, non-PvP until I see whether I believe it is worth entering the PvP world.  I believe it will either degenerate into the mindless slaughter that was UO (in which case I will remain firmly non-PvP), or become a balanced RPG environment (in which case I will become PvP).
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  What things do you see in EverQuest that make you want to play it more than Asheron's Call?
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Races, for one thing.  I haven't looked into Asheron's Call much, but I don't see it as comparable to EQ in the same fields.  I find a single playable race dull, and boring.  The Asheron's Call magic system, to me, leaves much to be desired. EverQuest's races, classes, magic system, and even the openness of the EQ team make me prefer EverQuest.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Maintaining a quality web site is a lot of work. What keeps you motivated to do all that work? 
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hmm....  Mainly interest in EQ and magic.  Which, also brings up the point that the Tower hasn't been updated in almost a month..  And, frankly, I lost my password.  The problem should be rectified by Monday.  Boy, I have a lot of updating to do.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Haha, I won't ask how you lost it.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And now for the silly questions that I just have to ask! (you can all thank Absor for these) *smiles* You're the first and only colonist on the moon. You don't expect any others in your lifetime. You have the essentials; food, water, shelter, but nothing else. You get one luxury item from a very short list : a fast computer and a fast connection to the Internet or another human being. Which would you chose and why (or who)? What if you were only going to be isolated for two years? 
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  An interesting philosophical question.  I would probably choose the computer/internet both times.  I like my solitude, and, as far as I'm concerned, I can interact with someone as much as I need over the Internet, and I have millions to speak to, including most people I already know, rather than just one.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Superman or Batman?  
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ah.... Batman, I guess...  That is, assuming you're asking which one I like better.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hehe, yea, personally I hate Superman, only like Frank Miller's Batman. Anyhow, thanks for the interview.
<br><br>
<b>Kunzite:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It was interesting, and quite an honor.
<br><br>
<b>Elaanilus:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The pleasure was all ours!
