<em>Discuss what makes a good beta tester for those who may be new to the process. Explain what needs to be learned from a public beta test, and the process behind that learning.

<br><br>
Now for the analysis.
<br><br>
STATISTICS:  While one might think that the physical skills, such as Manual Dexterity might be of great importance, in beta testing it is far more important to be bold than to be skillful.  What designers want to know about is what has happened when you used their new skill, spell, weapon, or when you went into a new area where nobody has yet ventured.  This means you'll spend a great deal of time rebuilding from defeat and from glitches which crop up unexpectedly, but discovering such problems IS the purpose of beta testing.
<br><br>
That's why Observation is the highest.  You must notice what was happening when the problem occurred.  (Were you under attack?  How high was the "ping" on your internet connection?  What EXACTLY happened before the lock up, and in what order.)  I mark common sense at the high end because you have to know when to bother the designers with a bug and when not to; Additionally, you need to have the good sense to follow procedure and do the obvious things-Like following directions, reading the manual, etc.
<br><br>
Believe it or not, attention can wane during a beta.  Let's say (Now hold your laughter just a moment please…) that [gasp] the game doesn't start out to be everything you expected.  (Okay, you can laugh now.)  You still need to stick with it and, given the opportunity, communicate to the proper individuals exactly what didn't work about the game for you.  Attention span also comes in when you figure that you will be doing a lot of rebooting your system from lock-ups, explaining what happened, rebuilding characters that were killed by monsters that were too difficult for it, or rebuilding because you fell off of a cliff, or were simply dinged by a bug in the game.
<br><br>
And it's necessary to do a bit of upgrading.  The latest versions of relevant software must be put onto your system.  Direct X, Glide, Video and Sound drivers all need to be on their most recent full release version.  You'll need the somewhat minor technical skills involved in performing such upgrades.
<br><br>
LANGUAGES:  It's necessary to have a rudimentary knowledge of techspeak.  When you are asked if you had a lock up or if you were booted, you'll need to know what the difference is.  Are you using a D3D based card?  Glide?  You don't need to be an expert on building computers, but you should be able to answer basic questions about your system:  Namely, how much RAM you have, what kind of 2D and 3D cards you have, speed of your modem, how fast you are connecting at, your ISP name, space on the harddrive, processor speed, etc.
<br><br>
If you bump into a player and they start using lingo you don't understand, simply ask what they mean.  Some people can't put it into english, but if they can, then that'll be helpful to you later when you run into a designer who wants to know about your problem.
<br><br>
EQUIPMENT:  You don't have to have the fastest processor on Earth, but often it is necessary to have one that is above the minimum requirements for the game.  Why, you ask?  Because often the early stages of development leave a game in a state where it has not yet been fully "optimized".  That is, it hasn't been refined to the degree where the lower end of their scale can handle it.
<br><br>
Remember, RAM and lots of it!  The less time that your computer spends swapping from the harddrive the smoother it will run.  Get double what they minimum requirement is.  This will help you immensely, though they often will let you in with only the minimum amount.  This isn't a "deal killer" to a possible beta tester, it's just one of those things that will really help YOU.
<br><br>
You must have lots of space on your harddrive.  Let's say you are given a disk with 450MB of info on it.  If you run from the CD that's fine.  If it all installs to the harddrive then you want to have a lot more than 450MB available.  Be sure you have 1GB of free space available before the install of a beta--Again, you can get away with less, this is just what I suggest you have available when asked.  (Don't lie!  Just go buy a harddrive.  They're darn cheap!)
<br><br>
Having an ISP or internet gateway to connect through is obviously necessary.  I know that's a no-brainer, but what the hey… I'm filling space.
<br><br>
SKILLS:  The ability to forge a sick notice may be necessary, as you'll want to put in lots of hours of overtime… in the game!  Forget work!  Be sure you have your priorities in order!!  Homework should be done before you get home at night (provided you went to school) so that you can jump right into the game.  FAQ foraging is an underrated skill.  It's best you read the FAQ to learn some of the things the game will offer.  This way when you wander around the world of Norrath you'll have in mind some things that you'll want to try out.  They may not be operational in early beta, but be prepared.
<br><br>
SPELLS:  Use this spell to get the wife, girlfriend, or parents off your back for a while.  They don't need the computer anyway.  You have important business!
<br><br>
And like all RPG characters, you, the beta-tester, must have a history.  Assemble your list of background in games both online and paper and dice role-playing games and have it available when asked what kind of experience you have.  Treat contact with sony a bit like a job interview--You want to be prepared for questions about your experience.
<br><br>
Well, with any luck, Plazageus of Newbieland will make it into one of the early stages, but if he doesn't, it's still important to participate in those late stages.  Because next time a game comes up he'll be able to say that he participated in the EverQuest beta.
