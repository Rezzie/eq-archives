I recently read Brian Hooks <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/ask/editorial2.htm#jun-16">article at Voodoo Extreme</a> about camping, and what his solution for it might be.  It's a very smart analysis.  He has all the reasons for camping and its affects nailed.  But I think his conclusion will prove wrong.
<br><br>
Mr. Hook concludes:
<br><br>
'But in the end, this is really what it will take to solve the camping issue - take the world of Norrath and make it a lot bigger, not just geometrically but in terms of zone allocation. For example, I would take Crushbone and split it into three similarly sized zones: the castle (for player levels 15-25), the castle grounds (6-15), and the Greater Faydark centurion camps (5-10). Make each of these "sub zones" comfortably handle 30 players, and all of a sudden the players will find it a little easier to breathe.'
<br><br>
He seems to have failed to consider the reason that the server population is averaging near 1,500.  Remember, there is no limit to the number of people allowed to play on a server.  People leave a server, or never start on one, because it's crowded.  Open up a server with more zones and all you'll get is more players per server with just as much crowding.  People crowd a server until the population reaches the absolute limit that they can take, and then they leave.  Their tolerance is based on how much they have invested in that server, either in characters or friends, or both.  It would be hard to pry me from my primary server.  But if I had just started there, and had only a few friends on the server, I would be far more likely to move to a new server when it got a bit crowded.  No matter how big the land of Norrath is on any server, it will fill until those tolerance levels are met, then it will stabilize.
<br><br>
Simply increasing the size of the world will not work as a solution for the crowding problem.
<br><br>
Actually, I <b>can</b> think of one situation where this would work.  If the servers themselves started to crap out after a certain level of players was met.  Let's say the land mass of Norrath (and its NPC population) were doubled.  People begin to feel free and happy.  But more and more people start on the server.  They also feel free and happy, so they stay.  Soon the average number of players on-line at peak times is 2,000.  They still don't feel crowded.  But now they find that their world is less stable.  The servers start to bog down, creating lag.  Now new people join up and find the world free, but a bit less happy.  The average reaches 2,200.  Now new people log right off and find another server.  Moving from the gates of Qeynos to the city clock is a trial due to the lag.  People already on the server, but with less attachment to it, find a new home.  The average population drops back to 2,000.  People have enough space.  Camping happens, but it's not a bother because it's not crowded.  But people complain about lag and warping monsters with the same volume as they used to complain about camping and crowding.
<br><br>
Pick your poison.
<br><br>
The real solution is to open up eight more servers, offer a one time chance to move characters around to any server they want, and then only allow 1,000 characters on a server at a time.  Raise that limit each time you make the playing field bigger.  It might suck to be unable to access your primary character.  But it would be a lot more fun to play a secondary character on a much less crowded server.  Please, please keep making the world bigger!  But don't think that it will solve the crowding problems.
