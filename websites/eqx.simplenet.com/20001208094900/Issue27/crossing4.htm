As Janell forms a reply, she spots something on the path ahead.  Completely
out of place in this snowy landscape, in his gawdy clothing  and armour,
walks a dark elf.  He strides about as if he owns the place, moving towards
the pair with complete confidence.  Before Janell could reach her volatile
friend, Angaram draws steel and launches himself at the intruder, shouting
obscenities that she'd never heard before.

The dark elf pauses in his stride and stands his ground, smiling
enigmatically as the armoured dwarf barrels at him like an avalanche of hair
and chain mail.  Just before contact is made, however, the dwarf collides
with an invisible obstacle and rebounds into a snow bank, disappearing from
view.  The ensuing string of epithets put his prior tirade to shame and
Janell blushes as she strides forward.
