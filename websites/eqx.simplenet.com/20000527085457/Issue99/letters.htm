		<em>[Ed. Absor - I'm sorry that I haven't been answering all the letters that I've 
		received about the Rogue tale, Moog and Aklar.  I wanted Aklar to <a href="aklarletter.htm">explain it to you all...</a>]</em>

While I miss Auntie Moog's column but after reading the new
replacement's (Gainam) writing, I must say that he is quite good and
bring to the column his own brand of "humor". Hmmm....how about both of
them sharing a column or have 2 separate ones? Just a thought:)

<em>[Ed. Absor - I suppose that, as a Tier'dal, you appreciate his... humor more than I do.  Well, he seems to be upsetting the staff here with all of his Hateful commentary on our clothing, appearance and the legitimacy or our births.  I think, in this case, my usual tendency to accept everyone will have to be overridden by a more basic need for peace among the staff.  <u>Side note</u> - Thanks!  I've had a blast writing him!]</em>

The Nameless is the entity that created all the gods, just thought you'd like to know :)

 While Fennin Ro and most others that you  mentioned have no history, if
 you read the history of Norath, The Nameless is  the entity that created
 the (minor?) gods you can choose to worship, and then I  think Vallon and
 Tallon Zek are supposed to be the sons of Rallos Zek...And  Tarrew Marr
 sounds like another desperate attempt to get a new server  name...He's 
somehow related to Erollsi and...Doh, the two Marr  twins...

<br><br>
<em>[Ed. Oghma - Heh, yes exactly :)  Like you, I know one or two facts about each of these
dieties.  The Nameless does show up in an official history, but well, we
know he's Nameless and that he created some gods... so... now what?  I
mean, he could be a monotheistic god! I'd like to see more, and I'll write
more too, but I like to believe that there is a point in a game world's
creation where events become events, and history is made by the players.
Up til now, really, it's more a run from quest to quest, or just a
camping/levelling fest - not a living, breathing world.  Thanks so much for
responding!]</em>

Lil Archy (Issue 97)
<br><br>
While I understand the humor behind the cartoon, I might consider pulling it
after what happened in California over Halloween.  A 12 year old was beaten
nearly to death with a golf club and then stabbed multiple times with the
shaft when it broke.  He had simply gone to the house trick-or-treating.
Some people might really be upset after reading this comic.  Trust me, I
know that he had no idea something like this would happen when the comic
strip was gone.  Just wanted to make you aware of the situation.
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
   Edward Myers

   <em>
[Ed. Absor - Well, I certainly understand the concern.  And we're not at all insensitive to the fate of that child and the coincidence of that particular Lil' Archy.  However, I do think that we all need to be a little less worried about coincidental relationships between our entertainment and the horrible things that happen in this world, and a lot more concern in finding out why these things happen in the first place.  If I for one instant thought that Lil' Archy was anything but just plain funny, I would pull it.  But I just can't see it the way you do...  
<br><br>
Beyond anything else, our sympathies are with the family of the victim.]
