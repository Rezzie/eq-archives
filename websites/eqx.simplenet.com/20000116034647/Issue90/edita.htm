<p style="text-align: justify">Well, week after week I get the chance to come in here and tell you all what I think about something.  Often it's something not very strongly tied to EverQuest.  After all, we've been doing this for nearly two years.  EverQuest is a great game, but seriously, how much stuff am I supposed to be able to talk about relating to just one game?</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">A quick side note about that one game thing.  Verant actually has two games available for you to play.  And the other one is having a free weekend right now.  I've complained in the past that they are letting their best game fade out for lack of advertising.  To my shock I actually saw a note in the update for EverQuest about the free Tanarus weekend (which, of course, meant that it got onto the front page of all the news sites).  I encourage all of you with a desire to blast the heck out of people from all over the world in a well crafted, team oriented tank-style combat game to head to <A HREF="http://www.tanarus.com/">www.tanarus.com</A> and PLAY.  And I applaud Verant for <B>finally</B> doing a bit of promotion for this great game.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Onward…</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">As luck would have it, this week I do want to talk about EverQuest.  I usually try to stay off the dead horse topics.  But not this week.  I'm going to turn necromancer this week and bring up one that should have been buried ages ago.  And I guess it's because it hasn't been buried that I want to talk about it.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Twinking.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">First off, it really is twinking, not tweaking.  From what I've been told the term twinking comes from MUDs and, basically, refers to Twinkie, the pastry.  You know, spongy cake outside, soft mushy lard middle.  It seems to have referred to the high level characters going around and aiding low level characters so that they could advance faster, with tactics like beating a monster to near death and letting the newbie kill it for the experience and loot.  It came to use in EverQuest early in the beta tester.  The testers put a slight spin on this term, adding the idea of giving characters items that are far beyond their level in order to help them advance…</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">No matter, really, the precise origins of the word.  Twink is what you call that soft mushy lard character wrapped up in a firm spongy equipment covering.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">The word tweak I can find in the dictionary:</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Hehe, part three says <I>small adjustments</I>…  I don't think that when people talk about twinkers that they are referring to characters that have been slightly adjusted, say with a couple of platinum pieces.  So, for me at least, the term Twink is the better of the two.  But to get in arguments over which is the right term is pretty silly, and is generally a way to avoid the point of discussion, and that is; is it wrong to Twink?</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I really like the idea of calling the giving of items of great power to lower level characters as Twink, like the pastry, because they both taste foul.  To me anyway.  But since this is usually an emotionally charged issue, I'll do my best to present both sides of this issue.  But it's important that you know my bias, and know now that when all is said and done, I plan to present a solid argument against the practice, and I'll even be bold enough to ask Verant to put a stop to it.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">So, as is good argumentative form, let's start with the reasons that twinking is good, so that I can shoot them down one at a time (if all goes well…  I wonder if outlining these things before writing them would help…).  I'll be taking points from people that support twinking, these are all arguments that I have seen used in favor of twinking, paraphrased, of course. </P>

<OL>

<em><LI>I've been through the low levels too many times.  They are boring to me now, and I give my character extra stuff to make it easier and quicker to get out of the newbie areas.</LI></em>

<p style="text-align: justify">I certainly understand this.  I'm like Oghma, I've played a lot of characters, switching to new ones before the old one gets too stale.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">But… if I've been starting so many new characters and then moving to new ones at about the time they are ready to leave the newbie areas, then maybe I don't think the newbie areas are boring.  This may very well just be a difference in personality types, but I like the newbie thing.  Low level characters tend to be just learning things, experimenting with their skills and the area of their home.  They tend to be a lot of fun.  But I'll easily concede that this is probably just me (and others like me).</P>

<em><LI>I'm a role-player, not a power-gamer.  A character can't start doing things and experiencing things until they are high enough level to travel and see the world without being killed the second they leave the safety of the newbie area.</LI></em>

<p style="text-align: justify">I accept that the game is more interesting and exciting at higher levels and in the higher level zones.  But anyone that says that role-playing doesn't begin until 10<SUP>th</SUP> level (or something like that) hasn't a clue about role-playing.  There are so many potentially life changing events that can happen at the lower levels that to breeze through them in order to get passed them is depriving your character of his life experiences.  The low levels, just like our real life youths, are the formative periods for characters.  I have a seventh level Dorf who has attained a serious hatred of pixies that I didn't know he had until I started playing him, and playing that out is always interesting…</P>

<em><LI>People that don't like twinking are just jealous.</LI></em>

<p style="text-align: justify">Maybe.  Certainly some of us are.  But just because someone doesn't like it does not mean that the reason is jealousy.  As I intend to show, there are a few good reasons to discourage and dislike twining, though some of my arguments will involve this point, and jealousy is certainly a factor here.</P>

<em><LI>It doesn't hurt anyone, so why shouldn't I do it?</LI></OL></em>

<p style="text-align: justify">This seems to be the key argument, and the hardest one to deal with.  The answer to this one is tied up in the economy of the game, people's emotions, and all sorts of other issues.  However, I also feel that I can show that it does, in fact, hurt others.  And if it hurts others, it's bad.  It seems that the reasons in favor of twinking are, essentially, numbers 1 and 2 above, and can be summed up like this:</P>

<B><I><P>Twinking is something that makes the game more fun for me, and it doesn't hurt anyone else.</P>
</B></I>
<p style="text-align: justify">If this were true I would certainly accept twinking and it wouldn't be a topic of such great debate over the net.  What I need to do here is show you all how it is that twinking does hurt others.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I'm going to cheat a bit here and paste in something that I posted to a newsgroup.  I've been trying to write it over, but I can't really make it sound any clearer than I did the first time:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Twinking affects the short term environment for those of the same level and in the same area as the twink, since the twink can effectively destroy the monster population at a rate that makes him/her the equivalent of (depending on the volume of the twinkage) as many as four or five characters of the appropriate level. This adds to the effective crowding of the zone, affecting those that are playing there. </LI>
<br><br>
<LI>Some people do bad things when playing twinked characters simply because they can, such as kill stealing. This leads to mistrust and hatred, something that most moral people like to avoid. This adds to point number 5.  While not in anyway a direct result of twinking, such bad actions are often taken by twinked characters, and it's hard to deny that there is a mentality involved that often leads to seeing the two together.</LI>
<br><br>
<LI>Some people do bad things (extreme camping of twinkable items) in order to twink their guild or their own characters. This leads to the same sort of stuff (hatred and mistrust) that number 2 suggests, and also adds to point 5. </LI>
<br><br>
<LI>Twinking is rarely a one step process. Once twinked for powerful stuff at 1st level, the character will often be twinked for better stuff at higher levels (banded becomes rubicite). This leads to a flood on the market for the earlier twinked items (banded in the example) when finally the twinker is done with it. </LI>
<br><br>
<LI>This is a key point, one that too many people ignore. Twinking leads to bad feelings (see reasons 2 and 3 above). These bad feelings cause people to hate, and hate is bad in any environment, EQ is no exception. Proponents of twinking claim that it is the fault of those that get angry about it (often calling it jealousy) for not accepting them. But those that get upset have some basis upon which to base that anger (see points 1-4 and others that I'm sure I missed), whereas the twinker only has the claim that he/she isn't hurting anyone (blatantly false since there is anger involved, and there are points 1-4) and that they get bored playing at the low levels as their defense. </LI></OL>


<p style="text-align: justify">The logical conclusion, to me anyhow, is that the ones that should bend are the twinkers, since all they are doing is relieving boredom (solution there is that they don't enjoy EQ, it's boring, move on). </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Certainly nobody can deny that twinking has caused a lot of bad feeling in our community.  A lot of it directed at the twinker, some at Verant for not stopping it, and a lot of it from the twinkers who are tired of being treated poorly and called names (like twinker).  In all the muddle of emotions the one thing that I come away with is a distinctly unpleasant feeling, the sense that all of this anger is not good for the game.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">This is a two sided issue.  The anti-twinks will claim that the twinks should stop doing it and all will be well, emotionally.  And the twinks would claim that all this bad emotion is due to the intolerant or unstable nature of the, perhaps jealous, anti-twinkers.  And they are both right.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">If you are a twinker, please stop and think about the emotional affect you will have on your community as well as the affect you have on the economy.  I honestly think that this emotional rift should be enough of a reason not to do it.  I think it's unfair to put your own needs (as petty as they are) above the needs of others (who may also be petty).</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">If you are an anti-twinker, stop calling twinkers names.  If you must be angry at them, keep it to yourself.  It's just as much your responsibility to do the right thing as it is theirs.  I never accuse anyone of twinking, though I won't group with them or aid them, unless I like them a lot for some reason.  It is possible for a character to legitimately, and with much work, gain items beyond their level.  I know someone that spent a lot of hours as a tradesperson, buying and selling things, making items and searching for ingredients.  She became wealthy enough to purchase items beyond her level.  There are reasons of economy here that I think make this a bad thing, but it's certainly not wrong for the player to do this.  They should be treated well, almost as heroes, for doing something out of reach.  If your group of low level characters manages to raise an army (picturing thirty drunken Dwarves storming Crushbone) of other low level characters to defeat an enemy that others think is beyond you, you should be praised, not cursed.  If you fulfill a quest (maybe even a GM generated quest…) that takes forever and requires great sacrifice and at the end are rewarded well, you should be praised, not cursed.  And some of us will put off buying things, like armor and spells, for several levels in order to purchase something really nice.  While not heroes, these folks are not villains either.  It is always best to assume that the people you meet are 'good' people and be wrong then it is to once accuse an innocent.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">In all honesty, I should be done now.  I think we all know that twinking causes emotional distress to the community, and that hurts people.  This should, really, be enough of a reason to justify my claim that twinking is bad.  Add to that the problems of economy that twinking accelerates and I can't see how anyone could do it.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">There is a lot underlying this issue, and the biggest part of it is the EverQuest economy.  In EverQuest we have an infinite source of new 'stuff' with a nearly perfect retention of the old 'stuff'.  Let's say that every day there is the potential for 10 Minotaur Axes to spawn.  And let us say that on the average day 8 of these axes are harvested.  After three days there are 24 Minotaur Axes in circulation where there were none before.  These axes will have a high value, after all there are only 24 of them.  The people that have them are keeping them because they need to use them.  One weeks later there are 56 more axes in the economy.  Add that to the 24 that are already out there, and there are 80 in circulation.  Let's assume that by now the folks with the first 24 have moved on to better weapons and no longer want their axes.  They want to sell them, and they can demand a fairly good price, having nearly one third of all the axes available.  But one month later they'll only be worth a few platinum because those 24 are less than one tenth of the available axes.  The price goes down, and therefore the average level of Minotaur Axe owners goes down.  Down below the level required to actually earn that item by killing its owner.  Soon enough Minotaur Axes are newbie equipment.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Twinking, and the practices that it engenders like item camping for guild members, exacerbates the situation by shoving better items than Minotaur Axes below their sale value (basically free).</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">So along with attempting to convince people not to twink, I also want to suggest that Verant make some fundamental changes in the economy to straighten this out.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I know there are supposed to be some sort of soft level limits on items, and that's the approach that I like.  Hard level limits are too arbitrary and harsh.  But your current soft limits are far too soft.  Tighten them up.  I would like to see each piece of equipment have a number associated with it.  For example armor.  Give a wooden shield a Wearability Number of, say, 10.  A Banded Helm might have a value of 14.  A Rubicite chest piece might have a value of 50.  The game would add up these values for all armor worn.  If that value was over the characters Defense value, subtract the remainder from the characters Defense and Agility scores.  I'd like to see it where a 1<SUP>st</SUP> level warrior in full steel armor can't walk because of it's weight and his unfamiliarity with the equipment.  The same could be done with weapons, give them numbers and compare them to the characters Offense.  Compare caster items to the users mana points, and subtract if the item is too powerful for them.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Yes, people would still twink.  But they would have to hold that rubicite on their 50<SUP>th</SUP> level character until the lower level one reached a reasonable level.  And he'd have to reach that level without the aid of the rubicite.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">To 'fix' the economy now might be too much of a shift in the game to be feasible.  But there really needs to be a greater money and item sink, or the economy is going to bloat and die.  Here are some of the ideas that I've heard and liked.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Item decay.</em>  I know that we've been told this won't happen.  But maybe it should.  Allow craft skills (with expensive components) to repair items.  Let enchanters repair magic items with a new skill.  Let Tinkering, Tailoring and Smithing repair items that are appropriate, like Tailors could fix leather and robes.  And have NPCs that do it too.  Maybe even include a chance that the item gets broken permanently during repair by a trade skill.  If done by an NPC the item never breaks, but they charge a very high price for the repair.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Looting Monsters.</em>  If an intelligent monster kills a PC, let the monster loot them.  Have it take one item from them and their cash.  So if the PC hunts the monster down he can get his item back.  But have the NPC lose some of the cash, and add a chance for the item to be broken by the clumsy monster.  And certainly let the monster use it if it can.  I would love to see someone trying to get their sword back from an Orc as the Orc slashes the heck out of the hero.  Though I do see a problem here.  This might lead to an exploit wherein PCs train other PCs with monsters then kill the monster for the PCs items…</P>

<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Bank Rent.</em>  Have the banker take 5% of all cash withdrawn.  I don't know how those guys earn any cash as it is…</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Whatever you do, you need to find a way to take items and cash out of the economy.  And you need to do something more definitive about twinking.  It's not really possible to address one without mentioning the other.  Maybe a tighter economy would reduce twinking enough on it's own, since items become far more valuable.  Maybe reducing twinking will aid the economy by keeping the value of items a little higher.  I don't know for sure.  But I'm starting to think that something needs to be done.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Oh, and items don't hurt people, twinking does.</P>
