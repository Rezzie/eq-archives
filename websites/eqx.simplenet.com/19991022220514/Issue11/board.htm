	<big><big>I</big></big> would like everyone who reads this article, and feels that they have
something to say about it, to do it!  However there are a few rules to
get out of the way before we go on.
<br><br>
1)  Things that I say or do in The Killing Grounds do not necessarily
reflect the feelings of EverQuest Express.<br><br>
2)  While I do want this to become a debat of sorts, I don't want, and
will not allow it to become another area where people feel the need to
consitantly flame one another.<br><br>
3)  Please, when responding, no foul language.<br><br>
4)  Finally, I might not always have the room put all of the responses I

get on the page, and I might sometimes try and shorten what someone
says, and if I inadverntantly change what you mean, sorry.  Please just
send me an e-mail and I will correct it the next issue.
<br><br>
Now, on to the meat of the matter.  What is probably the most important
aspect of an Online RPG, as respects to whether or not it does well?  I
would have to say that most of you would agree that the issue of player
killing, and how it is handled, is probably number one on the importance
list.  The few hundred or so games that I have played between MUDs,
MOOs, M59, and UO, all handle it a little different then the next, but
all are close to the same.  So I would like to see what all of you
think.  <a href="mailto:toturi@usa.net">E-mail me</a> and tell me, and I will
try and give percentages for next week.

1)  The Switch:  This is how EverQuest is going to handle it, at
character creation you decide whether or not your a pker, and then it
will change in game if you change how you act, ie:  Try and attack some
one, heal a pker attacking another pker, etc.  This is somewhat of a new
idea, or atleast one that I personally haven't play.  This looks to be
great system, but we will have to wait and see.
<br><br>
2)  The Reputation:  Only Ultima Online really used this in a game
system.  If you were a player killer then you had a bad notoriety,
couldn't go into towns, and were killed on site by city guards.  In my
opinion, this was a bad system, besides limiting access to an area to an
entire group of people, it created two groups of pkers.  The "Evil"
Pkers, and the pkers who hunted them down (and yes that still makes you
a PLAYER killer).
<br><br>
3)  The location:  This is one that I have seen on a lot of MUDs and
such, and is not to bad.  If you want to kill other players, you could
only do it in certain areas.  The only bad side that I found with this
is that it limits what types of things can happen throughout the world.
<br><br>
Please mail me with which you think is the best way (number them 1, 2, 3
in the body of the text please), and we will see what everyone thinks.

There is another important thing to think about when it comes to
role-playing and player killing.  Many believe that player killers are
just a bunch of losers who want to take advantage of weaker people.
Many player killers think that anyone trying to stop them or losers.
This really must stop, unless it comes from the character, not the
player!  Here is what I mean, if your a 'good' fighter, and you want to
go out adventuring, what reason do you have for trying to stop a group
of pkers?  Money?  Possibly, if some one is willing to pay you.
Adventure?  This is at least a good option, some of the most fun I have
had is playing tag with other players.  Now the Pker's turn, what reason
does he have for killing you, the 'good' fighter passing across the
highway?  Money?  Possibly, if he considers himself a highway bandit and
likes to play that type of role.  But even so, why waste the time on a
fighter, he probably doesn't have much money on him.  Now it can be
really cool if the pker's can figure out a good reason to attack that
character role-playing wise.  How about he feels that your going to
disturb his wifes grave that is close to the road (alright that is kinda
lame), or maybe he thinks that it is his job to protect the road from
evil people so that others can travel the road.  I think you get the
idea, if done for role-playing reasons, anything someone does should be
considered a cool thing.  I personally can't wait to play a Shadow
Knight that feels it is his job to rid the world of Paladins because
they force people to live according to their moral code.  So I might be
a pker, but I wont hurt anything that isn't a Paladin.  Once again, I
would like anyone who has a feeling on the subject to mail me (these
annoying reminders will stop once I start getting more mail then I can
handle ;).
<br><br>
Well that ends my rambling for this issue, hope to see you next!
