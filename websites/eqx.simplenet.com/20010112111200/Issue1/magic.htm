    align="JUSTIFY"><small> </small><big><big>M</big></big>agic is a big part of every RPG. It
    affects a lot of the game. And that is also the case in Everquest. In some of the most
    played RPGs of recent time like Diablo and Ultima Online magic was a pretty big part of
    the game but it did the magic system was not big at all. In Diablo there was approximately
    32 spells that were used and in Ultima Online there is approximately 64 spells that you
    can use. But in Everquest there is 5 schools of magic with their own unique spells and
    there have been rumors of the Bard class even having magical songs that they can sing.
    Here are only 2 of the types of magic that will be in Everquest. Now there has not been
    much info given out by the EQ staff so some of this is going to be the given info and
    speculations. <br>
    </font></p>
    <b><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p align="CENTER">Necromancy</b></p>
    <p>The first type of magic is<font face="boldPS" size="3"><font face="boldPS" size="3"> </font></font>Necromancy.
    If you choose your character to become a Necromancer well then you can't use any of the
    things that go along with the other schools of magic.&nbsp; To be a Necromancer you will
    most likely have to be of bad notoriety since you will summoning undead which are most
    likely always evil. The types of undead that can be summoned or unknown right now but will
    most likely be the same types of undead in most of the other RPGs. For example, you will
    probly be able to summon skeletons, zombies, ghosts, and hopefully maybe even liches.</font></td>
    <td width="33%" height="387" style="text-align: justify"><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p
    align="JUSTIFY">A Necromancer will probly not be able to summon the stronger types of
    undead to keep him from being too powerful, but you never know. If the EQ staff does let
    Necromancers summon the more powerful undead as they become more powerful then they will
    probly be summoning vampires, werewolves, wraiths, along with some other strong undead. <br>
    </p>
    <b><p align="CENTER">Enchantment</b></p>
    <p>The next type of magic that there is in Everquest is called Enchantment. Now being an
    Enchanter could very well be a profitable business. One of the powers as an Enchanter is
    the power to magically enchant weapons, armor, and mabye they will be able to enchant
    other items besides weapons and armor. An Enchanter could make a good living simply by
    using their power. They start a weapons shop and have the weapons enchanted and sold which
    would make a lot of money for them in the long run. They can also enchant weapons of
    traveling Warriors for a price. <br>
    <br>
    Now many of the players that are used to being a Warrior and like it a lot can take
    advantage of the Enchanter class. This could be done by having your Warrior already and
    then making an Enchanter character that would only be used for your Warrior's weapons and
    armor. There was also a discussion about this on the Everquest newsgroup.</font></td>
    <td width="34%" height="387"><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p align="JUSTIFY"> Here is some
    of the message that Brad McQuaid (Everquest Producer) posted on the newsgroup about this
    subject. &quot;<i><b> If you want to make an enchanter to enchant some weapons of yours,
    and he only exists to do that, and you give those weapons to your warrior, I really don't
    care. I don't consider that abusive (and, btw, 'enchant weapon' is most likely not going
    to be a first level enchanter spell.</b></i>&quot; So as you can see it will not be
    considered cheating or anything like that but you will probably have to play a little bit
    with your Enchanter in order to get him to be able to cast Enchant Weapon for you. Then by
    the time you've built your Enchanter up to that level you may even want to continue to use
    him instead of your Warrior. </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The class of Enchantment will probly turn out to be a very good choice
    for a character who wishes to make money, help people out at the same time, and also still
    be involved with magic. Usually characters of magic don't have many ways to make money
    besides maybe inscribing spells but atleast this class can make money. </p>
