Morality and the Internet.
<br><br>
Two words that won't work well together.  Not that they can't, they just won't.  This week I've been barraged with examples.  Fox replayed their segment about stings made on Internet child pornographers.  Not only are these guys selling child pornography to anyone with money, they are also stalking new 'models' over the Internet.  These guys were actually driving hundreds of miles to meet with these children.  I can't even get into how disgusting that is.  But these guys would be perverts at the least without the Internet, criminals more likely than not.  The Internet, however, is probably enhancing their activities with its ability to make them feel safe and anonymous.  I'm sure there are pages of psychiatric work out there covering this, and really this particular subject is too heavy for a game fan site editorial anyway.
<br><br>
I was also recently reminded that I lost a few hundred dollars worth of trading cards over the Internet.  I set up a trade with a guy, no, a kid (I'll not name him here, as much as I want to) living in Florida.  I sent my cards, he never sent his.  Sure, it was partially my fault for not taking better care in my dealings.  A little research would have told me that others had lost stuff to this kid.  But if I had made that deal in person I couldn't have been ripped off, unless this teenager is a lot bigger than I picture him…
<br><br>
And we all know how people act in chat rooms and on news groups.  For a while now I've wondered what it would be like to take a common news group flame thread, transcribe it to paper, and have some folks act it out in a Carl's Junior.  I bet it would lead to some arrests.  And I also bet that the same folks that type that crap up on a public chat room would not volunteer to be in my play.  They feel particularly safe hiding behind a few hundred miles of phone line.
<br><br>
The same thing applies to those of us playing games over the net.  I can play a few hours of basketball (ok, I can't anymore, too many doughnuts and too many hours in this chair…), and hear fewer truly offensive things than in ten minutes playing a game on the Internet.  I still love Tanarus, even after more than a year of playing.  But I've popped into an arena, using a new handle (so that nobody knows how lame I am by name alone), and been called lame, cheater and other less printable things before I've even had a chance to be lame or to cheat.  You've all seen it.  But to me Diablo started something even worse.  I can tolerate all the name calling that anyone can deal out.  But when someone takes the rules of my games and twists them, then I get mad.  And Diablo was the hallmark of cheaters games.  Folks found easy ways to turn it from it's purpose as a game and into one giant game of 'mine is bigger than yours'.  Then came UO…
<br><br>
But if these folks were to cheat in a game of Risk, Diplomacy or poker (you all remember those games that you play with people that you can actually see…), we'd kick their butts.  Instant wild west justice.  Most folks never really even think of cheating if they believe that there is a likelihood that they will get caught and punished.  But over the Internet they can hardly get caught, it's so easy to change a handle or find a new e-mail account.  And they never get punished.
<br><br>
But in real life a little punishment goes a long way.  Recently I read reports from the Magic: the Gathering World Championships.  I think I mentioned a while back the rampant accusations of cheating in the game.  Well, reports have it that the judges were very strict and vigilant at the most recent Worlds event.  Match loses and even an ejection were the results.  And I have not been able to find one report complaining about this.  That community seems to be quit pleased with the results.  And I am guessing that the amount of cheating in that game decreases significantly.  Heck, players may actually start to enjoy the game again.  But with Diablo there was no punishment for cheating, and so it continues.
<br><br>
I was going to relate an ancient bit from my personal experience with a card cheater at our then monthly poker games.  But it amounts to the same thing.  Some enforcement and the problem was solved.
<br><br>
And Elaan covered pretty well my feelings about the posting of the 'Beta Manual' in an <a href="violated.htm">article</a> this issue.  But he only yelled at the original poster.  I would have taken it further and berated those that reposted it as well.  Perpetuating a wrong is not a good thing.  In other words, two wrongs do not make a right.
<br><br>
It's just too easy for us to allow ourselves to indulge the dark side of our nature when we feel secure behind our monitors.
<br><br>
We Internet gamers have a unique place in the world.  We get to meet and be involved with other people from around the world.  But we have to realize that this is a frontier world that we venture into.  The only street signs out here are the ones that are put up by its citizens.  And a lot of them are just plain wrong, leading us to places that we wish never existed.  There is no real law here either.  Sure, some folks got busted on that Fox show, but if they got 5 perverts, there are 500 more out there that they didn't get.  And there is certainly very little of what I would call morality.  Let's not forget that we learn our mortality from our society.  If we learn in Junior High that blowing up toilets with M80s is considered wrong, eventually we may just stop doing it.  If we realize that society deems murder a bad thing and places harsh punishment on those that kill others, maybe we won't do it.  Sure, some will anyway, that's human nature.  But if nobody that has any respect in the community tells people what is wrong and what is right, then there is no morality.  And without it we don't have the right to tell people that what they are doing is wrong.
<br><br>
We, as a community, need to quietly but firmly press some morality into the fabric of our frontier world.
