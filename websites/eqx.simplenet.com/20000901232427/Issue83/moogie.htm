<b><em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I have a problem. I am a half-elf rogue that is not very liked. I have tried everything to be liked. When I meet a girl and hunt with her I usually insult her playfully (which is not well received) at first. Then after I get hurt a lot by what ever we are killing( and loot the corpse) to protect her. Then I tell her she looks good in her skimpy clothing. After I complement her ass she hurt's me(ether a slap or kicks me in the groin). I try to hunt in the sewer's of qeynos to cover up my body oder(Half-elves have naturally bad body oder). Also mages very rarely heal me and when they do I'm the last one they heal. Is this because I'm a rogue because if it is I will kill them while they sleep. How do i get people to like me?

   Moog not know what problem is… sound like you acting normal to me…  Maybe you just hunting with wrong kind people.  Come hunt with Moog, I like you fine!

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
I am a proud member of the first elven race of Norrath the Teir'dal. I have taken a path many Ogres and Troll choose but few of my kind, that of the Shadow Knight. As such, I have sworn to destroy all things my faith decrees is vile such as dwarves, wood and high elves and such things. But, recently, I have seen a group that has sworn to destroy all I hold dear. Namely Ogres, Trolls and Teir'dal. They call themselves the Order of the Mithril Warhammer or Mithril Warhammers for short and are lead by a vetran dwarven paladin. I must admit, he truely annoys me with his self rightous help others attitude but, I can not find a group to counter these do good tree huggers. I was hoping with your many contacts you might help me find a group to meet with so we could wipe this blight off the face of Norrath once and for all. Bet they have nice loot!!!

<b> Dear Taal
 <br><br>
    Moog not know much about all this group stuff.  When Moog go fight, she fight alone.  But then, Moog is older and more barshing under her belt than lots people…   Why not make own group, stead of looking for one?  Then you can be big boss, get more loots, have more fun. Yes?     Moog feels that luv knows no races.  So he just barshes whoever he wants on head with luvstones.  (old Troll myth…romantik, eh?)  But don't marry no one because they cute.  Marry cause you gonna like them when cute wears off.

<em>Dear Aunti Moog,
<br><br>
Why doesn't any girl like dwarves?  Every female of any race I talk to says they aren't interested in me, even dwarves!  I am the best looking of dwarves, but all the girls ignore me!  I like the wood elves, of course, but some of the gnomes are cute too... please help me!  oh, and no trolls or ogres.  But i COULD manage a barbarian.....

 Dear Bryarr

    What's wrong with trolls?  Now Moog's feelings hurt…

<em>Dear Auntie Moog,
<br><br>
 I dont know whats wrong with my friend Oarbok.  he is what i call a tamed Ogre, but still likes to bash peoples skulls open.  i don't understand the complex that all ogres trolls and drows have.  , could you clear this up? or will i have to kill you and make armour of your hide?

Dear Morgain

   No need to fight Moog, lil humie, Moog answer you.  Trolls and ogres need to have funs, too.  And all you humie, elfie games are too hard.  So we play our kind games.  "Barsh skull open" is very old, very traditional.
