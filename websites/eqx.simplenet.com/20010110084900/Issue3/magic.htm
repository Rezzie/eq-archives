<big><big>A</big></big>s many of you who read the EverQuest message boards and news group will know that there has been a lot of talk whether there should be Moongates
or a type of Recall spell in the game. There have been posts where people would not
like them in Everquest at all and posts where people would like them in a game but
with some differences than the way Ultima's Moongates were used. Also there have
been posts about the good and bad parts of recall type spells.<br><br>

<b>Moongates</b><br><br>

Some people have been posting that Moongates should be in the game but
with some modifications. For example, there was a post on a message board that
said you should only be able to use then maybe once every two hours. Another
thought was to only have them available to certain mage classes that would be able
to cast a spell for it. So people would still like to have them in Everquest just not the
same way Ultima had them.

However, some people just would not like Moongates in EverQuest at all. One
person posted that Moongates should not be in EverQuest because they take away
from the adventuring. Instead of being able to adventure into the wilderness
between each city fighting your way through you would only have to walk through a
Moongate. Another post said it would take care of the all of the PKs hanging out
around the Moongates waiting to kill and loot. Well that won't really be a problem
with the PK switch though but it should be considered. Also people were getting
mad with the area being over crowded by tame animals, furniture and useless items
along with the frustration of usually not being able to go to the right town you
wanted to but instead going somewhere else or sometimes actually staying at the
same Moongate.<br><br>

<b>Recall</b><br><br>
In Ultima the Recall spell was thought by some to be a bad spell to have in
the game. They thought this because it was a sort of abused spell. It was
sometimes used by PKs so that they could kill someone, loot their body, and then
Recall the hell out of there. Also it was used by the weaker players to loot
something like a lich, drake, or even a dragon that was killed by a stronger player
and was therefore left with no reward. This made people come to hate the spell or
for some, love it.<br><br>

Some people would prefer to have a Recall spell in EverQuest or a similar
spell for a few reasons. One person said that if they wanted to adventure with some
friends that were across the map they would rather recall to a nearby town instead
of wasting 2 hours of playing time having to walk to them. Also people just want it
for the sake of not having to walk and instead going to where they want to go.<br><br>
