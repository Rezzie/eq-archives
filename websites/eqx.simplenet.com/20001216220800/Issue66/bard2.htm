The next morning, in the cold light of day, the idea seemed like career suicide. She spent the day in uncharacteristic silence, but Thagor did not mention it.  He took her on a tour of Kaladim, showed her all the changes that had occurred since she'd been there last, and proudly displayed the forge he had established with his brother and the money he'd gathered in the years of his adventurous youth.  In the late afternoon, he begged off to go conduct services in the local temple.  He was still a cleric, and took his duties to his god most seriously.  Alone in his house, Elnore put her head in her hands and tried to think of a way to save her reputation.  She would never, if she lived as long as a High Elf, live this one down.  
<br><br>
   The dinner hour approached, and both Thagor and his guest grew steadily more nervous.  The time grew near for Elnore to meet with the boy, and she dreaded it.  When the knock finally came at the door, they both jumped in their seats.  Thagor opened the door and let in his nephew.
<br><br>
   The lad was tall for a Dwarf, and fair, with wheat coloured hair and bright blue eyes that were alive with some indescribable passion for life.  They riveted her, caught at her soul, and did not let go.  The Dwarf was one of the most intensely alive people she had ever met.  She understood well how Thagor would have found him difficult to refuse.
<br><br>
   "Elnore, my nephew Amgho.   Amgho, my old and dear friend Elnore."
<br><br>
   "A pleasure," said the young Dwarf.  Elnore returned his bow with a feeling of surprise.  His voice, although rough of course, and deep, had a rich tone to it, a kind of resonance.  She straightened, hesitated for an instant, and then held out her hand.
<br><br>
   "May I see your hands?" she asked.  Amgho paused and then tentatively stretched his hands toward her.  She took them in hers, turned them over and then back again.  They were untypical of the usual miner's paw.  The fingers were long and straight, the bones articulated.  They showed none of the cramped and calloused roughness that she expected.  She let him go, her thoughts racing.  Thagor opened his mouth, closed it, and then took a deep breath.
<br><br>
   "Shall we?" he managed.  Elnore nodded absently.   Amgho watched her with those burning eyes, his whole heart writ large on his face.  They retired to the dining room to eat.
<br><br>
   Amgho barely took his eyes from her the whole time they were at table.  Elnore found it difficult to eat under his scrutiny.  At last she threw down her napkin and spoke abruptly.
<br><br>
   "Your uncle has informed me you wish to become the first Dwarven bard in the history of Norrath."  Amgho flushed brick red at her tone, but nodded.  "Well, he has a claim on me, and for the sake of our friendship and the memory of his bravery in the service of my family, I will honour it.  If," she held up a hand as the young Dwarf started from his seat in joy.  "If you can prove to me that I will not be humiliating both you and myself in front of my Guildmates."   She stared challengingly at him.  "Sing."
<br><br>
   With one uneasy and almost apologetic glance at his uncle, Amgho opened his bearded lips and sang.
<br><br>
   His voice was like the slow movement of earth, raw yet rich and full of promise.  Its low timbre was rough, yet somehow not unpleasantly so, and he was perfectly on key.  He sang an ancient lament in Feir'dal, about the kidnapping of their ancient king and queen by Innoruuk.  His pronunciation of the Elder tongue was perfect.  His voice throbbed with the grief and loss, caught every nuance of hope and despair that the ancient songsmith had struggled to show.  His talent staggered Elnore.  His was a powerful Bardic gift.  
<br><br>
   When he was done, there was silence in the room.  
<br><br>
   "Ready yourself," Elnore finally said, her mellifluous voice unsteady.  "We will leave in the morning."  The young Dwarf's face blazed with joy.  Thagor gave a mighty sigh.
