I've had some experience running auctions, and I wanted to share some of the things I've learned.  It's often better to be organized in an auction than to be constantly spamming the auction channel with twelve items in a single message, along with every other auctioneer in the zone.  A good auction will get higher prices for the people selling, and more items out for those interested in buying.
<br><br>
First off the auction channel is a "floor" and not a channel for broadcasting items for sale or trade.  An auction is for a player to announce he has an item for bid, and there are certain things he will want to identify with this announcement.   I will take you step by step with notes of how I'm going to auction an executioners hood that I want to sell.
<br><br>
/auc is the floor open?<br>
(You always want to make sure the channel is clear and your not stepping on someone else's auction in process.)
<br><br>
*Assume the floor is open
<br><br>
/auc I have a rare Executioners Axe for bid.  The stats on this item are AC 9 +5 Dex weight 1.5 can be worn by (class) (race).  The minimum bid for this item is 400pp.
<br><br>
Notice that I gave complete stats for the item, as well as which class/race can use it.  In a large auction with many interested players, the number of tells can get overwhelming and confusing.  Some tells can get missed, and those tells could very well be the one player that will pay the highest price.  These tells happen when a player wants to know more about the item s/he is bidding for.  If you give them the knowledge they need with your bid, you won't need to answer questions like "Can bards use that?" or "Is that a magic weapon?"
<br><br>
You can also use "no min bid" meaning any amount can be used to open the bid.  This really gets people excited.  I like to do this for items like fine steel swords. If you do not get a bid say in thirty seconds announce withdrawn or something to that effect due to lack of interest. You can try at a later time.
<br><br>
We now have the floor and have declared our item and the minimum amount we are going to accept for the item. All players should use the /auc to bid on your item so all players involved know a REAL player is actually bidding and your not trying to pump up the bid yourself. DO NOT ACCEPT SILENT /tell BIDS!!!  If you do, and get caught bidding it up too often, you'll get a bad rep and no-one will trust your auctioning.  /telling someone "Oh, that other guy decided not to buy it" gets people suspicious after a while.

Dave auctions " 400pp"
<br><br>
(Dave just started his bid at 400pp)<br>
(Its always common courtesy to acknowledge a bidder by saying his name and what his bid was.  I do it like this.)
<br><br>
/auc 400pp heard (hrd) Dave
<br><br>
(This lets Dave know that his bid was accepted)
<br><br>
Jeff auctions " 450pp" 
<br><br>
(now you have a challenger)
<br><br>
Again…
<br><br>
/auc 450pp hrd Jeff
<br><br>
Joe auctions "What's on the floor"
<br><br>
(Late comers will commonly enter the game during the auction or wonder what all the excitement is about and all that money..  So you might repeat your bid like this..  You might even draw more attention to your item and push your total even higher)
<br><br>
/auc I have a beautiful rare Executioners Axe for bid.  The stats on this item are AC 9 +5 Dex weight 1.5 can be worn by (class) (race).  The current bid is is held by Jeff at 450pp
<br><br>
Now, excited about the item, Joe bids.
<br><br>
Joe auctions "600pp"
<br><br>
/auc Wow!!  Joe challenges the bid with a horrendous bid of 600p HRD!!
<br><br>
(Get excited about bidders.  It gets them pumped up and more people will jump in and start bidding, wanting to join in on the fun.  Hell I can get so excited with a good auctioneer I'll bid on stuff I don't even need just to enjoy the fun.)
<br><br>
Jeff auctions "OUT"
<br><br>
(Jeff is letting you know he is no longer interested in that item at that price, but keep going because you still don't have a winner yet.)
<br><br>
Silence…..
<br><br>
/auc Executioners Axe 600pp Going once
<br><br>
Silence 
<br><br>
/auc Twice
<br><br>
Dave auctions "610pp"
<br><br>
/auc Whoa Dave keeps the bid alive at 610pp
<br><br>
Silence…
<br><br>
Joe auctions "700pp"
<br><br>
/auc Joe comes alive again with 700pp!!!
<br><br>
silence…
<br><br>
/auc 700pp for the Executioners Axe going once…
<br><br>
/auc Twice…
<br><br>
/auc Thrice ..  
<br><br>
/auc the Executions axe is….      ..   (build the suspense)
<br><br>
/auc SOLD!! To Joe for 700pp
<br><br>
/auc The floor is now open
<br><br>
This lets the next person to take the floor.  Normally the floor is owned by the first person that gets his item out..    All other items are ignored… 
<br><br>
::::::::::DONTS::::::::::::::
<br><br>
These are examples of what and auction is NOT for.  You can request these folks to please use /shout or /ooc, so that those who are following the auction can turn those channels off, and it keeps the auction channel open for serious bidders.  Auction channel flood is very annoying, and sometimes makes it impossible to follow your bidders.  
<br><br>
Examples:<br>
/auction I have a bronze long sword for sale for 10pp send me a tell if interested<br>
/auction Im looking for a Helmet.. I'll pay good money
<br><br>

I hope this helps you guys.  I ran an auction on Saturdays and made over 3000pp that I never would have made just declaring a set price.   I had over 20 players show up who also had items to auction, and we drew in about 100 people into the zone to enjoy the bidding.  We estimated about 10,000pp was traded that day.   It was a lot of fun and brought back some of the mud day memories for me.
