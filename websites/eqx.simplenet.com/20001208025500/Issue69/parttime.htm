<p style="text-align: justify">It's dark.  The blinds are drawn.  You've managed to get through a full day of work, survive the commute home, fix dinner, bathe the children, brush their teeth, and read bedtime stories.  Since then, each child has gotten out of bed and called you for something at least twice.  You're exhausted.  </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Your husband came home late, as usual, and you shared the reheated dinner in the kitchen.  While he stretched out on the couch to relax, you dug your running shoes out of the closet and padded around the neighborhood for some exercise.  The misty trees reminded you of Greater Faydark (although the bats are much smaller, and you're not carrying a splintered club).  After a short shower, you brushed your teeth and dressed for bed.  The two of you spent some time talking, or watching TV, or doing whatever struck your fancy at the moment, and you shared a sleepy yawn.  </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">He's upstairs snoozing.  You're downstairs waiting for the latest patch to load.  It's after 11:00 pm, and you're just <I>now</I> finding time for Everquest.  </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Welcome to the world of the part-time quester.</P>

<hr color="black">

<p style="text-align: justify">I've had Everquest for a week, and I'm hooked.  The catch is while my friends are off killing mammoths in Everfrost, I've just now squished enough bats outside Kelethin to make it to level 2.  People around me are casting strange spells that I've never seen before and discussing quests that will lead them to far-off cities.  They're tackling orc centurions while I consider the best place to sell wasp wings.  They run down the Kelethin rope bridges and leap across platforms, while I'm still carefully picking my way around, trying not to fall.  Needless to say, I feel a little underclassed.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Then again, I've been in this situation before.  I had a Diablo Battle.Net account number under 3000 but never made it to level 40.  I played UO for months and never mastered mark and recall.  By now I know going into a game that I'll be behind everyone else before the first day is through.  But I also know that part-time gaming can still be a wonderful outlet.  Sure, you'll never be the hottest thing swinging a sword, and sure the game is more like a short break than an epic adventure to you, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun.  </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">The world of the part-time quester can be a little odd.  After a few weeks of play, you don't consider yourself a newbie anymore, but you're so far behind all of your friends, the prospect of ever being able to adventure together seems remote.  All in all, your puny little character seems a little hopeless.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">It's not. </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I'm certainly no expert, but I've found the following pointers to be useful.  If nothing else, they make me feel a bit better about my situation and the fact that while my friends are rattling around in full chainmail, I scarcely have enough money to buy a cloth wristband.</p>


<UL>
<B><LI style="text-align: justify">Keep Your Balance.</B>  Everyone struggles to balance the different demands on their time, from work or school to family, friends, and whatever else they've got going on.  Try not to get frustrated if you hardly have any gaming time at the end of the day - the fact that you're part-timing shows that you're handling other responsibilities (or at least doing your best).  </LI></UL>



<UL>
<B><LI style="text-align: justify">Enjoy your Games.</B>  Just as important, don't feel guilty about taking the time to play now and then.  Sure, you've got lots of irons in the fire, but you've got to take time to unwind, be a little creative, and enjoy your "me time."  Doing the things that make you happy now and then is more than selfish fun, it's something that keeps you from getting completely ground down.  Some folks read books, some paint pictures - we whack monsters online.  What's not to love?  I admit I get far too little sleep some nights, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make to squeeze in a bit of frivolity.</LI></UL>



<UL>
<B><LI style="text-align: justify">Avoid the "Get a Life" Syndrome.</B>  So you're still stuck at level 4 after a month of play - whatever you do, don't start traipsing around advising the high level characters to "get a life."  Be honest and admit that you, too, would likely be playing much more if you had the opportunity.  Just as your slow advancement doesn't make you a bad player, their online achievements don't make them bad people.  There's always more to your fellow players than meets the eye.</LI></UL>



<UL>
<B><LI style="text-align: justify">Keep Current on Game Information.</B>  Don't let yourself get to the point where you toss your hands in the air and shriek "I don't even know how to play this game."  Read the manual several times.  Breeze through message boards regularly.  Check the updates on the EQ websites (there are some amazingly helpful sites out there).  You'll feel much better if you understand the game mechanics, trust me.</LI></UL>



<UL>
<B><LI style="text-align: justify">Avoid quest spoilers.</B>  Spoilers are called that for a reason - they ruin your fun.  Worse yet, when you can't even afford a rusty dagger, hearing about a special weapon quest in another city shifts your salivary glands into overdrive.  The problem is that it may be a very difficult quest that you, in your ragged, shabby state, won't be able to complete for quite some time.  Stick to the minor quests in your area, and keep reasonable goals.  If you discover and solve the quests for yourself, you'll be justifiably proud of your accomplishments.  If you try to force yourself through solutions that you read on some cheat page, you're turning it into more of a task, and the <I>last</I> thing you need is more work.</LI></UL>



<UL>
<B><LI style="text-align: justify">Admit that you're having fun.</B>  Ok, so stepping on rats isn't as glamorous as skewering orcs, but it's not that much different, when you think about it.  Why do you want to solo advanced monsters so quickly?  Probably because they drop more goodies and give more experience.  But remember, everything is relative.  One day, you'll be swatting orcs around and wishing you could solo minotaurs.  In other words, it's ok to want to advance, but if you let it spoil the fun you're having <I>now</I>, then you'll never have fun at all. </LI></UL>


<p style="text-align: justify">and finally...</P>


<UL>
<B><LI style="text-align: justify">Stop playing catch-up.</B>  If your friends are levels ahead of you, you'll never catch up.  Ever.  Be realistic.  Maybe they'll start a new character and bum around with you, but unless something drastic happens to one of you (perish the thought), you'll never be able to pack in all of those extra hours.  Talk to your friends and enjoy the tales of their magnificent journeys, but remember that there are plenty of folks your level walking around, and plenty of part-timers in the same boat.</LI></UL>


<p style="text-align: justify">Your journeys are every bit as enjoyable, and you should be every bit as satisfied with your skills.  So heft that worn club and whack a few bats.  Just watch out for splinters.  And guano.  Otherwise, you'll be just fine.</P>
