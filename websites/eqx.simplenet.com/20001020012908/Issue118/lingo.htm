  DON’T TALK LIKE THAT!!</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I, 
  actually Absor, recently received an email in regards to my “guide” on <a href=../Issue117/barbdiction.htm>Common 
  to Barbarian</a>. Actually I am glad the individual took the time to write in 
  because it brings up an issue that has quite a history with me and the mode 
  of speech or “lingo” I use when playing a Barbarian. This topic, however, is 
  not limited to just the mode of speech I use, but any mode of speech players 
  use trying to give their characters more depth. Here’s the email:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>I 
  am not usually one to complain, but when I read the Common to Barbarian section 
  in issue 117 I had to. It may just be a server difference (I hope). What is 
  called Barbarian on in the article is far closer to how Trolls and Ogres speak 
  on the servers I've been on. I spent about a month as a Troll and several more 
  months as other races, so I should have a pretty good understanding of their 
  language. All Barbarians that role played an language around me, even in Halas, 
  have used a Scottish language similar to Braveheart or the appropriate Highlander 
  flashbacks. I'm having to restrain Snuggleguts from smashing you for attributing 
  his language to puny humans. I am sure that there are Barbarians who are equally 
  upset about the language mix-up.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  Thanks for listening to my ranting, Khamul writing for Snuggleguts, Troll Shadowknight 
  of 14 seasons P.S. I know Everquest is just a game, but its such a great game 
  with a rich, largely player created environment.</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There’s 
  several issues revolving around lingoes but let me address them one by one completely 
  out of order.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>I 
  spent about a month as a Troll and several more months as other races, so I 
  should have a pretty good understanding of their language.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I 
  think it’s really great that people have spent quite a bit of time noticing 
  other lingoes players try to use. That this person noted some similarities between 
  the lingo I portrayed and Troll, yet not call it outright Troll, is very observant. 
  Of course to my eye, Troll and my version of Barbarian look totally different. 
  Following in line with what Khamul states he should know about Troll since he 
  spent a month as one, I shall also state that I should know about the Barbarian 
  lingo I use. I have been using this lingo for seven years to depict a Barbarian 
  Drawl.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Some 
  History</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Eight 
  years ago playing a game called Drakkar a friend of mine Zoddie, known as Zodiac 
  and Zzerker, and I, known as Onyx and Onnie, came up with the pattern style 
  for the lingo used in my Common to Barbarian Guide. It was developed over a 
  period of two years playing that game. In fact Gimili, a Sysop for Drakkar who’s 
  been with them for ages and still is, perverted the lingo even further. He’ll 
  say “yew” while we’d say “ya’s” and so forth. The lingo was in it’s final form 
  and as you see it now well before Ultima Online even went into it’s first phases 
  of alpha.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When 
  I came to the Avault Newsgroup Forums where the developers talked to the players, 
  EverQuest was not yet in beta nor had they even put a start date on phase 0.5. 
  I used this lingo under the persona of Onyx for posting IC statements and joke 
  replies to messages. I was told by a couple of people that the lingo was UO 
  knewl d00d speech and the forum was going to burn down in effigy because of 
  it. That knewl d00d’s seeing me speak in that manner would encourage them to 
  flock to the forum. I had no idea at the time what a knewl d00d was, nor how 
  on earth my lingo would relate to them. I had never played UO, so I set about 
  trying to figure out what they were talking about.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Lo 
  and Behold, I went to a page that was listed with someone’s name, I forget now, 
  calling themselves the Role-play Master of UO. It showed a screen shot of a 
  knewl d00d saying something like:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “1 
  \/\/1|| |<1|| dat”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
  only word I could understand at the time was “dat” of course. I had not been 
  exposed to this other mode of speech. I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. 
  I looked in other places and sure enough “dat” and “da” were all over UO. I 
  by no means claim ownership, nor do I think Zoddie would, we never even thought 
  of getting a copyright on it... darn it. But I did find it vastly amusing when 
  our friends, upon being asked, told us how they started “dat-ing” and “da-ing” 
  and soon many on the server/shard were doing it. Perhaps “ya’s gonna kill dat?” 
  was all over another game, I don’t know. I have played LoK, NWN, etc. so has 
  Zoddie and other friends, and I had not seen it unless we were using it. It 
  is possible that we were the sole originators. Many people in Drakkar would 
  use that mode of speech and it’s merely an assumption of mine that possibly 
  that’s how it spread into UO. I could be completely wrong and it just evolved 
  there on it’s lonesome. The point of where it came from however really isn’t 
  an issue.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>More 
  History, but not so long ago</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
  first time I was in Western Karana during beta Oxesiess started throwing a fit. 
  She had talked to Tiny Miller. I had not known until then that EverQuest had 
  put a lingo in for Troll and Ogre speech which contained some key basics Zoddie 
  and I used for Barb. Oxesiess’ fit was about Tiny not speaking properly. I think 
  the Monk with me thought I was nuts for yelling at an NPC and trying to correct 
  his speech patterns into a more Barbish style. Since that day, and even before, 
  I have been informed by a few players or followers of the game about several 
  things:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 1) 
  You don’t talk right<br>
  2) I can’t understand you<br>
  3) You sound knewl <br>
  4) Barbs don’t talk like that <br>
  5) You’re speaking like a Troll</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Wash 
  rinse and repeat. Of course in my mind, Trolls and Ogers speak more like Oxes, 
  NOT the other way around, since the speech predates them crawling out of the 
  mud, swamp, or changing from frogloks. This still however is not the main point. 
  The main point is...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WHAT 
  does it matter?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Should 
  my barb perhaps use the word “to” just like the other 12 races because “ta” 
  is reserved to Trolls and Ogres only? All the rest of us need to speak not using 
  the word “da” because that’s reserved as well. It’s okay for us other 12 to 
  share the word “the” but not “da”? How would you attribute Ogres and Trolls 
  learning to talk in the first place instead of only speaking Froglok? Think 
  the dark elves took time off from being so superior and evil to teach them? 
  Couldn’t a character possibly with heavy human background have been involved 
  in such a thing through their portion of the tribe? What about the barb in question 
  coming from a tribe in Ro which supplies food shipments to Halas? This causes 
  the barbs to heavily interact with Ogres and Trolls. The results is the barbs 
  speech warped over time. This couldn’t have happened? There are all sorts of 
  possibilities here, none of which are to be ruled out and I haven’t even really 
  started racking my brain.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> How 
  many have actually sat down and tried to create an entire lingo? Honestly if 
  anyone has I would love to hear it. I am completely fascinated by lingoes and 
  ways to pervert speech so that your character SOUNDS like they have a drawl. 
  It is not an easy task to have text reflect annunciation of words. A high-elf 
  could walk up to Oxes, start speaking like Oxes, and she would be completely 
  enthralled. She would most likely not even notice until she had “thunkered” 
  that the elf was speaking like her. Is this WRONG or something to get upset 
  about because the high-elf has a drawl? Absolutely not. Perhaps that High-Elf 
  has a past history of spending childhood years with the tribe Oxes was in and 
  grew up speaking like them vs. the parents. Makes sense since that’s what the 
  child would have heard predominantly.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When 
  I hear lingoes I think of it as that extra little touch people are giving their 
  characters. It’s like wearing a wrap with that black dinner dress. I honestly 
  cannot fathom why other players instead of trying, in character, to find out 
  someone’s background feel the need to stand up and inform a player that they 
  are “Doing it Wrong”.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
  different modes of speech for barbs I hear not only on my server but also in 
  the forums, range widely from heavy “Aye’s”, to Oxes “Ayeps”, to “Yah!” I attribute 
  these to different tribal upbringings. Such as the difference you can hear from 
  a Northern Accent in the US and a Southern one, or a British Accent and an Australian. 
  Should I be running around telling the barb who says, “You know I really need 
  to go educate that fellow shaman on when to blast and when to heal” that he 
  sounds like the average wizard when he speaks? I think not.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I 
  seriously hope to one day meet an Ogre or Troll Role-played with some snap for 
  languages so I can get into a argument with them just for fun. Until then, let 
  me give some examples side by side of Common, Troll, and my mode of Barbarian:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Common: 
  Think</i><br>
  Troll: Tink<br>
  <b>Barbarian: Thunk, Thunker, Thunkered</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Common: 
  We slaughtered them all perfectly!</i><br>
  Troll: Me barsh dem froggies gud<br>
  <b>Barbarian: I’s done bashy good! (or) I’s made all da lil beasties DEADED!</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Perhaps 
  it’s just me but I see a pretty big difference. Here’s more.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Common: 
  Did you see the humans around here?</i><br>
  Troll: Did yoose see dem humies round?<br>
  <b> Barbarian: Did ya’s see da humans round ere?</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Common: 
  That was a powerful spell my friend.</i><br>
  Troll: Dats sum gud mojo yer doin dere<br>
  <b>Barbarian: Dat was an awesome finger wiggle’n ya’s did.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Common: 
  You shouldn’t eat those dwarves because the little bits stink in your teeth.</i><br>
  Troll: Yer shoudnt eet dem dorfs cuz dem bits stick in yer teeth.<br>
  <b>Barbarian: Ya’s should’n eat da lil uns cause da lil bits stick in yer teeth.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Common: 
  Put me in a spot will you? Prepare to die!</i><br>
  Troll: put inna spot? me barsh yoose<br>
  <b>Barbarian: Put me in da spot will ya’s? I’s gonna bashy da snot outta ya’s!</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Verant 
  has not released an official language guide to this game and until they do really 
  no one can claim a “Proper” way. I seriously doubt they will however, since 
  it limits players in the various aspects of developing their own lingoes as 
  added background for their characters. There are NPCs that speak with a lingo 
  up in Halas, though most NPCs don’t. I think Verant meant to put it in the game 
  but just ran out of time. The basis for that thought is that there’s one particular 
  NPC that if you speak to him regarding one quest, he replies in regular English. 
  If you speak to him regarding another quest, he replies in a lingo. Are all 
  the barbs who don’t speak with perfect English like he does on the one quest 
  wrong? Are all the barbs who don’t speak with his lingo on the other quest wrong 
  in their speech patterns? I’d have to double check but I am almost 100% positive 
  he uses either the “da” or “dat” when he talks. So, does this mean all the barbs 
  trying to emulate a “Braveheart” sound but don’t use “dat” or “da” are wrong? 
  Of course not.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Enjoy 
  or have fun with the creativity people are trying to bring and the depth they 
  try to add by opening their mouths. This applies to those that have decided 
  to Role-play with the “Thee or Thou” to the “dat’s” to the “dorfs”. I hope anyone 
  who has encountered the “You’re not doing it right” or “you sound like (insert), 
  not what you’re trying to sound like” will do like me, just keep role-playing 
  along. There are no hard lines for how we all should sound, there is no right 
  or wrong.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There 
  is a part in this email that’s dead on, <i>“P.S. I know Everquest is just a 
  game, but its such a great game with a rich, largely player created environment.”</i> 
  My guide was written in fun and nothing more. Something on the lighter side 
  that I hoped people would laugh at with translations from a single word spoken, 
  into about 9 words. The P.S. sums up the whole reason I wrote the guide in the 
  first place, that last P.S. is so true and I hope it never stops. Particularly 
  with <b>encouragements</b> like the one that follows, which have and most likely 
  always will confuse me, <i>“I am sure that there are Barbarians who are equally 
  upset about the language mix-up.”</i></font></p>
