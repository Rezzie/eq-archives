The night was young but yet I was very tired.  As of late, my training has begun to slow in its progression.  The voices have returned to me… assaulting my mind over and over.  Visions cloud my mind… of the Great Deceiver Thepa… of the Feir'Dal invading our homelands… of the Humans slaying our young…  And now a new one comes to me as of last eve.
<br><br>
When I returned from Lavastorm, I heard many conversations.  Most were talking of the "Daughter of Innoruuk".  I believed, at first, they spoke of me.  I have been told by many that I am the Daughter of Innoruuk, a Firstborn.  But as I walked about the huddles of Teir'Dal and our allies, I hear a name over and over again:  Lanys T'Vyl.  It was she they were calling not only the Daughter of Innoruuk but also the Avatar of Hate.
<br><br>
All of a sudden, I felt very sleepy.  I thought to return to the Spires but my body did not feel like it could make it that far.  Instead, I found a tree not far from the entrance of Neriak and hid myself there as I laid myself down to rest.
<br><br>
That night, I had a terrible dream.  I do not remember the specifics, but I do remember what I learned from it.  It showed me that Lanys is not the Daughter of Innoruuk but instead a False Prophet; the woman who appears to be Teir'Dal and claims to be the one and only true Innoruuk's Daughter.  But I know the truth.  I know that she is actually the spawn of Thepa and such knowledge shall be spread to my people to save them from her blasphemous words and deeds.
<br><br>
And as I awoke, I heard them... the voices had returned.
<br><br>
"The Deceiver's Child is back" they whisper in my head over and over.
<br><br>
I grab my Hammer of Wrath, given to me by my Father Innoruuk and walk forth to teach this wench the true power of the Father.
<br><br>
When I reached the entrance of Neriak, I saw a mass of Teir'Dal and Trolls surrounding a woman.  I begin to walk towards her when she says to me, "Ahhh, the falsechild."
<br><br>
This one would be tricky indeed.  Using my own words against me.  But it was not something I had not already expected.  When one does battle with the God of Pain known as Thepa they know that tricky and deceit are his main tools.
<br><br>
I simply say, "I am the Mouth of Innoruuk."
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, "I am Innoruuk's <b>true</b> Daughter."
<br><br>
A foolish Teir'Dal by the name of Shakrot says "This doesn't look like a mouth."
<br><br>
I say, "Nay, you are but a falsehood."
<br><br>
"Liar! Falsehood!" the spawn of Thepa screams as she beseeches her father to aid her, knowing my words... my very presence would show her true self.
<br><br>
A few moments after she screamed those words, I felt the world flash before my eyes.  I knew I had been struck down by the gods.  Actually, one god.  Thepa, the Great Deceiver of the Teir'Dal.
<br><br>
But death was not to be mine.  I felt my life slip back into me... but I was no longer in the Neriak entrance.  Instead, I was in my home... my Father's home.  The Spires of Innoruuk.
<br><br>
I quickly make my way back to the entrance.  As soon as I am there, I face the falsechild again.  She looks into my very soul, trying to pierce it with her father's gaze.  But I knew behind that stare was a scared child.  Her father was not strong enough to slay the faithful child of Innoruuk.  I say to her, "Do my words scare you, falsechild?  Do you fear the Teir'Dal will see through the minion of Thepa's charade?  It seems that the Father has given me life again for a reason.  To prove against your heresy."
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, trying to cover up who is actually striking me down, "Innoruuk shall strike you down again, Heretic!"
<br><br>
"And the true Father shall give me life again, false one.  The Father is greater than your power, Minion of Thepa."
<br><br>
Again, our gazes meet.  The battle of wills commences.  She stares into my eyes and sees that I am my Father's child, my will indomitable.
<br><br>
"Strike me down, though, if it makes you feel better... show your weakness," I say to her.
<br><br>
One of the Father's faithful by the name of Jamaer shouts, "Lanys T'Vyl is a kinslayer!"
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, "I call upon the Lord of Hate, my Father! Strike down the false Daughter, and teach her a lesson!"
<br><br>
Another Teir'Dal comes forth, asking "Where is this newcomer with such power?"
<br><br>
I scan the skies, looking for this beam of power supposedly from Innoruuk to strike me down.  None comes.  "It seems he has spoken, false one."
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, "You are the child of the Deciever. And you shall pay, foolish girl."
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Shakrot scratches her chin, not knowing who to believe.
<br><br>
Finally, the power of Thepa strikes me again... and again I receive life from my Father in the Church of the 3rd Gate.
<br><br>
Again, I return to the entrance.  I knew I had bested her.  I have spoken the truth over and over, never laying a finger upon her.  The truth was my weapon in those battles and it struck deep.
<br><br>
I returned to the entrance to see Lanys T'Vyl killing many Teir'Dal.  All the while yelling "Foolish Heretic!" or "None may touch me!"
<br><br>
A wise Teir'Dal by the name of Telan approached the Deceiver's Daughter and asked, "How do we know you are who you say?"
<br><br>
She replies by only saying, "Telan, you question my powers and my heritage?"
<br><br>
He replies by saying "That I do, for anyone can protest that they are what they say."
<br><br>
I had heard enough of her blasphemy.  I had seen enough of her slaying my kin in the name of her father Thepa, God of Pain.  No more Teir'Dal blood would be shed!
<br><br>
I shout, "Lanys the Falsechild is a kinslayer!  Would our Father Innoruuk wish His child to slay His people?!  Hear the true words of the Father, not the speech of the Daughter of Thepa!"
<br><br>
But already some of the Teir'Dal had turned from the Father and had not known it.  Rajaat, a young Teir'Dal says, "Not all of Innoruuk's children are loyal, and thus many must be cleansed Kallystra. The blueness of your skin does not reflect the blasphemies spewed forth from your mouth."
<br><br>
But in my defense, many Teir'Dal speak forth.  One was Melisandre who said to the masses, "Kallystras words ring true in my ears! Lanys is a false prophet of our Father Innoruuk."
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, "I shall prove it to you..." as she sets an icy glare upon Telan.
<br><br>
Another Teir'Dal by the name of Ayria says, "She is back..."
<br><br>
Jedig says, "Who is?"
<br><br>
Ayria says, "Kallystra."
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, "Father! Teach this mortal a lesson!"
<br><br>
But I shout to the crowd, "Who is the false child here?  Lanys slays our brothers and sisters when I speak the truth... would the spawn of Innoruuk do such things?"
<br><br>
Fatallia says, "Why do you kill your own brethren Lanys?"
<br><br>
I say to Lanys, my eyes burning with the hatred of the Father, "Would you kill the children of Innoruuk again, kinslayer?"
<br><br>
Another Teir'Dal by the name of Fiilch shouts, "Who kills our kin in our homeland?"
<br><br>
"Would you kill the Father's shocktroopers of darkness?" I ask her again, waiting for a reply.
<br><br>
Azreal shouts, "The so-called spawn of Innoruuk seem all too eager to slay each other for less reason than that."
<br><br>
Again, I question her before the Teir'Dal and our allies "What have you done for our people aside from kill us?"
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, "Kallystra, you have two choices... serve or die."
<br><br>
I respond, "I have saved the masses in Nektulos. I have helped stop the spawn of Thepa.  I am in Nektulos daily, healing my kin and readying them for battles.  I helped stop the kinslasyer."
<br><br>
But she does not answer me, just stands there, at a loss for words.  The sword of truth was deep in her gut indeed.  I give it another thrust...
<br><br>
I say, "You have done nothing. You slay the Teir'Dal.  Not even the kinslayers, but the Father's faithful.  You have even slain members of the Blood Coven who serves our Queen!"
<br><br>
Melisandre shouts, "All should know the power of our Father.  We do not need her or her falsehoods to know the truth!"
<br><br>
And then another Teir'Dal questions her. Fatallia asks, "How was Giua a heretic?  Why did you kill him for just questioning you?"
<br><br>
Greblik shouts, "Kazeek thool wud hab nun ub dis!"
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, "Telan, you wished proof?" as her hands fill with power, ready to strike.
<br><br>
But, before she can slay another of the faithful, I stand between them.  If any would take her wrath, it would be me.  I say to her, "You are not the Father, your word is not law."
<br><br>
Fiilch shouts, "The Will of Innoruuk is not in the hereafter, but in the present, carrying out his will upon those that his hatred is poured out on."
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, "I am the Father's ephemeral hand"
<br><br>
I say, "You alone do not command who lives and dies.  You are nothing but a spoiled child full of power."
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, "Innoruuk, Lord of Hate! Teach this mortal a lesson and show him your power!"
<br><br>
Fatallia says, "I do not think the father would agree with your harsh judgement."
<br><br>
Melisandre shouts, "May the father of us all bring pain and suffering upon those who listen to the falsehoods spewed forth by Lanys T'Vyl."
<br><br>
Lanys stands before me, power at her fingertips, ready to strike me.  She raises for the kill when I say, "Kill me again, though.  Show your true colors and allegiance.  I have not raised a hand to you, child.  But kill me again."
<br><br>
Fatallia says, "Lanys T'Vyl if you touch Kallystra you are abusing your powers."
<br><br>
Lanys T`Vyl says, "Kallystra, your insolence shall be silenced. Your Father who gave you speech, shall now take it away."
<br><br>
Quickly, I felt the power of Thepa the Deceiver about me.  I tried to speak, but could not.  I tried to yell and shout, but no words came forth.  I tried to speak to those with my mind... but he even silenced that.  And many have noticed that I was speaking but words would not come forth...
 <br><br>
Fatallia says, "Lanys T'Vyl has let her power go to her head."
<br><br>
Azreal says, "Who is it that claims to speak our Father's words?"
<br><br>
One of the Blood Coven's faithful by the name of Qynnralla saw the Deceiver's child about to strike another of the Father's children.  Qynnralla strikes with a fury and the fight begins.
<br><br>
Many of the Teir'Dal are upon her.  I cannot stand back and watch their blood spill at the hands of the Daughter of Thepa.  Over and over the Father's power of Furor strikes from my hands into Lanys' being.  And when my mana was depleted, I grabbed my Hammer of Wrath and began to strike her.  All around me, Teir'Dal were falling by the power of Thepa.  But my will was indomitable and I fought on.
<br><br>
Lanys' few minions and followers surrounded her, trying to save her from my wrath.  Spell after spell, they cast upon me, but most were shrugged off.  I am my Father's daughter and I would pull her blasphemous tongue from her mouth if it was the last thing I did.
<br><br>
Finally, I noticed that Lanys was not hurt.  When I first saw her, I took her measure and noticed her skill was well beneath my own.  But somehow, the power of furor and the might of my hammer were not harming her.  I looked around me, striking those Teir'Dal that would try and stay my hand of hatred.  I would fight them all to my death.
<br><br>
But one of the Father's faithful saw what I was trying to do.  He was stronger than I and enchanted me to his will.  He then had me run behind him, all the way to the Commons and away from harm.  My blood boiled with hatred for I wanted to show the Deceiver's child and his new found minions their error of their ways in turning their back on the Father.  But this Teir'Dal that saved me was wise.  At the moment, it was not a battle I could win.  Not alone.
<br><br>
So, when we were far enough, he tried to talk to me but I could still not reply.  My words scared Thepa greatly and he did he best to make sure I would not be heard.  I bowed before the brave Teir'Dal that saved me and gated to my home, the Spires of Innoruuk where I would regain my strength and my speech... and plan the downfall of the Deceiver and his child Lanys T'Vyl.
