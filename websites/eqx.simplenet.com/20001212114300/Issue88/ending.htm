When Darvinn and t'Ceira saw each other again, their hearts were full and their soul's were sad.  t'Ceira jumped to hold her love and flew right through him as if he were air and the curse was sealed.  What they didn't know was the Hargor's spells were set to take effect the moment they tried to touch again. 
<br><br>
Rumors abound in the land of what could break the curse.  One says that a Greater Light stone, summoned from a High Elf and dipped in the blood of a Sand Giant, delivered to the couple by a Gnome would break the curse.  Yet another says that the Scythe from a Specter used to kill a Cyclops, combined with the feather of a Griffin and then given to t'Ceira by a Troll Warrior on his or her knee would break the curse.  And still another speaks of a Wizard casting a simple spell on a simple snake fang, filled with the essence of a Skunk, when it is plunged into the heart of Nagefen would break the curse.  And all of us know that the death of Hargor himself would break the curse.  No one knows where Hargor has disappeared to.  No one knows what he has up his sleeve.  No one knows the evil things he has in store for the future.
<br><br>
There are many who flock to t'Ceira and Darvinn's cause.  There are many who band together keep the two apart.  No matter what side you are on, you have now heard their story.  Yet, it is not done.  It has not been ended!  When will the curse be broken?

<em>The final pluck of the Bards chords lingered softly in the smoke filled  room of the Freeport Inn.  Not a sound was heard as the patrons shuffled out except the tinkling chime of silvery coins falling into the bowl left on the floor.  The Bard, packing up his belongings for the evening, slipped up to his room and the haunting memory of the song hung in air.</em>
