My life is a patchwork of things I have seen,<br>
A myriad visions of places I've been.<br>
I've traveled through Freeport,<br>
And then to the 'Vale,<br>
Now on I shall wander through storm and through gale.<br>
<br>
A patchwork collection of items I hold,<br>
From new-crafted armour to weapons of old.<br>
My gloves were once Waji's,<br>
My lute came from Dain,<br>
My cape and my axe were the Pencerdd's domain.<br>
<br>
Amrothe the master exerted his art,<br>
And smithied the shirt that now covers my heart.<br>
My boots from Sephira,<br>
My drum from a store,<br>
My belt from a goblin who needs it no more.<br>
<br>
One day in the commons I heard a sweet sound,<br>
And outside the tollbooth Isara I found.<br>
On hearing her music,<br>
I started to sing,<br>
Isara then gave me her magical ring.<br>
<br>
A patchwork collection of chattels am I,<br>
A many-hued traveler 'neath Norrath's sky.<br>
Belongings around me,<br>
My mind full of song,<br>
Exploring forever the place I belong.<br>
