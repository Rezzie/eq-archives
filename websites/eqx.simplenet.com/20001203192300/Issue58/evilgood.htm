Almost all of my characters fall in the good to neutral range.  I've played Oghma, the dwarf warrior and dwarf cleric.  I've played Elanor the high elf cleric.  Arthedain the Paladin, Amlaith the ranger, Amergin the bard (lot of 'A' names there… hmmm) - all were good characters. I had some mage-types too, who were neutralish.  I picked a troll once for a while to have fun, but it wasn't a developed concept, more like a "let's see what the troll area is like" type of character.
<br><br>
Because of my dwarvish sympathies, I disliked dark elves.  What a nasty race!  Ruthless, cruel, dedicated to causing suffering in the world, and arrogant beyond belief.  I couldn't imagine, really, a mindset that would have me enjoy playing a dark elf.  In the 20 years I have played RPG's.   I've only played one Drow, and that was because the campaign was all Drow, and I had no choice.
<br><br>
Then one day I was cruising the web, looking at poetry sites.  I have a bachelor's degree in French Literature, so I was checking out the French poets I could find.  There was a great site for <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Metro/1301">Baudelaire translated into English</a>.  Baudelaire was a mid 19th century poet whose works were full of anguish and hate, morbid fantasies and mockery of the status quo.  It is telling that he was one of the foremost translators of Edgar Allen Poe's works into French. Poe is about as morbid and weird as they come.
<br><br>
	Here's an excerpt of Baudelaire's poetry:
<br><br>
<center>"When by an edict of the sovereign powers <br>
the Poet enters this indifferent world, <br>
his mother, spurred to blasphemy by shame, <br>
clenches her fists and condols God: <br>
Why not have given me a brood of snakes <br>
rather than make me rear this laughing-stock? <br>
I curse the paltry pleasures of the night <br>
on which my womb conceived my punishment! <br>
Since I am chosen out of all my sex <br>
to bring this scandal to my bed and board, <br>
and since I cannot toss the stunted freak, <br>
as if he was a love-letter, into fire, <br>
at least I can transfer Your hate to him, <br>
the instrument of all Your Godly wickedness, <br>
and so torment this miserable tree <br>
that not one of its blighted buds will grow!'"</center>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Reading that poetry gave me a different insight into the dark elven race. I saw them as dispossessed outcasts, struggling to maintain their head high after repeated snubs and brutal wars.  A highly cultured and literate race, forced to live in darkness until darkness is what they became, enraged at the twists of fate. How twisted, how beautiful the language of their poetry was! (Was Baudelaire a dark elf?) The perfect EQ minority, as it were…
	<br><br>
I made a Shadowknight character, and started in Neriak, City of Darkness.  That was, I think, the clincher.  Neriak is so Dark Elvish that you feel oppression of the world outside and the arrogance and might of the race inside Neriak.. It is a beautiful, terrible place where the walls speak to you of your races tribulations and the power you once had, and will have again!  I began to sneer at the humans and ogres in the Foreign Quarter of Neriak.  Who let these punks in? I thought.  I began to love the Tier'dal as a role-playing experience.
	<br><br>
Now I had a dilemma.  I'm not a mean guy!  I'm pretty laid back, I believe in forgive and forget, and in doing unto others as you would have them do unto you.  How am I going to play evil?
<br><br>
Evil is about caring about yourself over others.  It is about increasing the chances that those around you will fear and hate you.  Evil is also about making the world a worse place to live - for everyone else.  It is totally opposite what I believe about playing in a MMORPG.
<br><br>
BUT - the ascension of evil is my ultimate goal as a Tier'dal.  Anything I could do to make evil flourish is also a Good Thing (or evil thing? I'm confusing myself!).  I began to help out other dark elves in Nektulos if I could.  Running past a Tier'dal mage being overwhelmed by foes, I helped him dispatch them.  "One serves Innoruuk as best one can," I frequently stated to their expressions of thanks.
<br><br>
I even macroed that sentence.  I found myself macroing other things, like emotes (/em sneers.)  I switched my language to Dark Elvish, and refused to speak to those barbarians who could not speak that most beautiful language, the language of the Tier'dal. 
<br><br>
I found that a delicate balance exists in the expression of evil.  To my fellow dark elves I was a tad condescending at times, but at the same time never crossed the opposite line to actually being jovial or friendly.  To the other races, I was rude, ignoring them or talking over their heads as if they weren't there.  I would make fun of them in Dark Elvish, making all the Tier'dal crack up while the other players were ignorant of what was being said.
<br><br>
I know there are things I have yet to do, such as go PvP, but that day will come soon.  I must rid Nektulos first of it's oppressors, then strike out into the commons to raise the banner of Innoruuk to it's rightful place - the dominance of the world by the Tier'dal.
