    Now, I am not usually one who believes in any version of the &quot;slippery slope&quot;
    argument. Just because one thing happens it is not always the case that it will lead to
    other, more extreme things. But I also believe in prevention. So I will tell you what I
    see as a worst case scenario. Picture this situation exacerbated by the introduction of
    the inevitable random player character killers. A further separation occurs between the
    switches. Soon there is little interaction between the two. After a while those that are
    UPI switched start to feel like they are on UO. Most of the role-playing types that are
    UPI start over as non-UPI characters or just quit altogether. Due to the proliferation of
    random character killers in the UPI realm, non-UPI characters say a few I-told-you-sos
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to </td>
    <td style="text-align: justify" width="242"><br>
    completely avoid all UPI characters. Soon we have a Norrath full of non-UPI characters
    chatting in olde English filling the taverns, and a mad genocidal killing fest in the
    woods amongst the UPI characters.<br>
    <p>All right, that won't happen. But I sense that we all feel a solid separation between
    the two types of characters. More strongly than we do between a necromancer and a healer,
    an ogre and a dwarf, or even male and female. So what the heck is my point? Well, I might
    have some game suggestions for the designers to reduce this problem, but that is a
    different article. Mostly I just want to encourage all of us to ignore the switch once we
    are actually playing the game. If your character would heal that warrior, heal him without
    considering your switch implications. </td>
    <td style="text-align: justify" width="242">If your character would attack that thief, do
    it, don't look at his switch. Let's find some reason other than the switch to distrust our
    neighbors.<br>
