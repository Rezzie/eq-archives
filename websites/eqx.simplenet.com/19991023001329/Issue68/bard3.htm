   The trip back to Kelethin was swifter than her previous journey.  Though untutored and incapable of performing the magic himself, Amgho learnt the drumming song quickly, and his voice supported hers in her songweaving.  They nearly flew through the countryside.  The grass at the side of the road bent over in the wind of their passage.   The travel that had taken her four days to complete alone, was over in two and a half.  They arrived at Kelethin late in the afternoon of the third day.
<br><br>
   The soaring platforms and dangling bridges of the Wood Elf city fascinated and terrified Amgho.  On the trip up to the city proper, he remained in the center of the magical lift, clutching her arm with fingers that gripped painfully tight.  They reached the top and she urged him gently forward.  Shamefaced, he loosened his grip somewhat and muttered apologetically to her.
<br><br>
   "I'm not good with heights." 
<br><br>
    Her doubts mounted, but she pushed forward.  How was he to live in the soaring city with a fear of heights?  As they passed along the swaying bridges and flimsy-seeming ramps, the Wood Elves glanced sideways at the stumpy Dwarf with thinly veiled amusement.  He was aware of it and grew silent and resentful.  By the time they reached the Songweavers Guild house, he wore a glower that could have cracked rocks.
<br><br>
   "Did you think it would be any different?" she asked him quietly.  "The people of your city treat me not only with disdain but distrust.  Think yourself lucky."  His glower grew heavier, not less, and she sighed to herself as she pushed open the double doors.  
<br><br>
   The entry was empty, but from within came the sound of laughter and song.  They were practicing for the great open concert, Elnore knew, the one she should have been training her students for this past week.  She took her courage in her hands.
<br><br>
   "Stay here," she told Amgho, and went down the hall to the last door.  She took a moment to ready herself and then entered.  
<br><br>
   The Senior bards were sitting in a circle, tuning instruments and humming, adjusting the sheet music in front of them.  A new composition of the Guildmaster, it was to be performed as the highlight of the Summer Solstice Concert.  She was to have sung the solo.   As things were now, she would be lucky to be included in the chorus.  
<br><br>
  As she came through the door, all activity stopped.  Her guildmates looked up with welcoming smiles, and Sylia Windelhands, the Guildmaster, set aside her flute and stood.
<br><br>
   "Elnore, I am surprised to see you return so soon!  Did you outdistance the wind?"  Sylia laughed merrily.
<br><br>
  "Indeed, I left it choking on the dust from my boots."  Elnore smiled in return, but could not summon up the mirth to match Sylia's.  Sylia raised an eyebrow.
<br><br>
  "You look troubled, Elnore.  Was your friend well?"
<br><br>
  "He was well."  Elnore squared her shoulders.  "I have brought a hopeful, Guildmaster," she said formally.
<br><br>
   "But, Elnore, that is good news," said Melwyn Di'Rathe, his brow creasing.
<br><br>
  "He is…" Elnore's purpose faltered in the face of her fellows' waiting expectation.  "Unique," she finished lamely.
<br><br>
   "Unique?" asked Sylia.  "Uniquely talented?  Uniquely young? Uniquely old?  You pique my interest.  Bring in this hopeful, and let us have a look."  She sat down again, smiling.
<br><br>
   "Very well," Elnore sighed.  She turned, and leaning out the door, waved Amgho to her.
<br><br>
  There was dead silence as he stepped through the doorway.  For a long moment, no one moved or spoke.
<br><br>
When Sylia parted her lips finally, Amgho forestalled her with an abrupt movement forward.  He stumped into the room, his heavy brows drawn low over his deep-set eyes, his entire body radiating determination.
<br><br>
  "I know well what you are all thinking at this moment," he began.  "I know it well, because it is the same reaction I have gotten all my life, ever since I felt the call of the bardic gift. I ask only that you restrain your jokes, your laughter and your outrage until I have had a chance to prove you wrong.  At least give me a chance to change your minds."
<br><br>
  They stirred, drawing breath, and Sylia held up a hand.
<br><br>
  "Let him," she said, her eyes sharp.  She leaned forward.  "Show us, then young Dwarf.  Change our minds."
<br><br>
  Amgho drew himself up, that same wild hope and joy blazing in his face that Elnore remembered from Thagor's house.  He closed his eyes for a minute as if overwhelmed by emotions that he could not voice, and the relaxed visibly.
<br><br>
  "I will sing you 'Anthiel's Lament'," he said.
<br><br>
   "You have courage, at least,"  murmured Sylia.  Amgho flushed heavily, but his resolve did not waver.
<br><br>
He opened his mouth and his vibrant, raw, powerful voice flooded out, wiping the half smiles and scornful anger from every face.
<br><br>
   When he was done, there was silence again.   He stood stolid and still, like a tree stump, and waited.  Finally Sylia stood.  He looked at her with his heart in his eyes.  She came to him, and took his hands, as Elnore had done, examined them, and then let them fall.  She gazed at him for a long moment.
<br><br>
   "You may stay.  Of course you may stay with us, and learn."
<br><br>
   Amgho's smile lit his whole face, and he took in a shuddering breath.  He scrubbed at his eyes roughly.
<br><br>
  "Thank you," he whispered.  
<br><br>
  "Thingal, will you show him to the apprentice's quarters, please?"  Sylia asked the Apprentice Master.
<br><br>
   "Willingly," said Thingal, and set aside his lute carefully.  "If you will come with me?"  He escorted the jubilant Dwarf to the door.  Amgho paused as they passed Elnore, and clasped her hand briefly.  He seemed about to say something, and then did not.  He simply smiled again.  She nodded, her heart filled suddenly with affection for the strange, passionate Dwarf.  Then he was gone.

   Amgho went to bed that night exalted and filled with a strange sense that he was moving through a dream world, that tomorrow he would open his eyes and find himself back in Kaladim, staring at the stone ceiling of his small room at the forge.   He lay down and closed his eyes.  The breeze from the open window caressed his face, stirred his beard and hair.  He could hear the leaves of the trees moving, whispering.  The platform seemed to move slightly under him, and he clutched at the bed, thinking of the hundreds of feet of empty air between him and the forest floor.  He would have to get used to it.  There was no way that he could go home, not even if he became the most famous bard in the history of Norrath.    His uncle had expected him to fail, and would not be best pleased that he had not.  His father...
<br><br>
   Amgho turned over in the soft bed, uncomfortable.  His father would disown him.  He had told him that he was taking a trip to see about the prospects of selling armor to shops here in the Wood Elf city.  How he was to tell him the truth, Amgho could not imagine.   His father would disown him, and likely strike him from the family records.  He could just see the veins popping out on Malkior Bakosh's head, his eyes blazing, his beard standing out from his face like the spines of a porcupine.   Amgho scrubbed a sudden moisture from his eyes.  He had known the price he would pay when he had set his feet on this path.  It was over late now to be mourning the bridges he'd burned.  And to be here, to study music...  The pain in his heart turned to joy.  To be allowed to sing.  
<br><br>
   "I would do it again," he told the whispering night.  And slept.
