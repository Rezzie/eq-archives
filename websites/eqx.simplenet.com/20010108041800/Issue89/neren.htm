<br><br>
	"Tuluvdar!" said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	Tuluvdar ignored them and entered the Soldiers of Tunare.  A minute later, Heartwood, Laughingwater, and Tuluvdar ran up the ramp and past them to the ranger guildhouse.  Neren thought Heartwood said something to Duror.
<br><br>
	"Did you have any lessons with Maesyn?" Neren asked Gilerrin and Renidyen.
<br><br>
	"I reached the rank of two today after killing some bats," said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	"I was just looking around," said Renidyen.  "I still can't decide what to be…"
<br><br>
	Neren sat down, and noticed Duror had brought the staff along.  Duror had dropped it near Neren.  Neren picked it up and rested it on his lap.
<br><br>
	"Well I kinda want to be a paladin… I mean the life of a glorious knight - the soldier of goodness..." said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin laughed.
<br><br>
	"Paladin?!  Why not choose the path of the rangers?  A paladin!  You'll have to show yourself a lot you know; you'll get a bunch of attention."
<br><br>
	Renidyen smiled wistfully.
<br><br>
	"What?!  You want that?" said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	The Wood Elves looked at each other.
<br><br>
	"I've always loved attention.  You saw when I tried to show my talents in class," said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	"Yes, but we thought you were just fooling around," said Duror.
<br><br>
	"I wasn't.  I wanted to do that.  I have no doubt that my father was proud of me."
<br><br>
	"But he's a Human!" said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	Neren stayed quiet as usual.
<br><br>
	"And you want to be paladin all for attention?" said Duror.
<br><br>
	"No, I just like being the 'soldier of goodness'. "
<br><br>
	"Soldier of goodness!" laughed Duror.
<br><br>
	"You know, you Wood Elves are too reclusive to the rest of the world."
<br><br>
	"Hey, that's not true; we like exploring," said Gilerrin as Duror said, "No we aren't.  We just like our home."
<br><br>
	"But you don't like meeting other races.  My mother was lucky enough to find someone like my father."
<br><br>
	"She's a Half Elf herself.  Besides, she's crazy," said Duror.
<br><br>
	Renidyen glared angrily at Duror.  Duror shied away, feeling guilty.  Gilerrin stepped in between them.  Renidyen thought about fighting, then sat down.
<br><br>
	"She's not crazy.  She just does things unimaginable to you Wood Elves," said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	He waited for a rebuttal, but none came.
<br><br>
	"Many Humans like showing off their bravery, that's all.  Most of them like attention and glory.  You just like defending and exploring.  Don't argue with me; I've noticed.  Any Half Elf needs to watch his or her own tail."
<br><br>
	Neren felt sorry for Renidyen, but showing his sympathy would have been a shame.
<br><br>
	"I'm sorry," said Duror.
<br><br>
	"Apology accepted," smiled Renidyen.
<br><br>
	<em>That was a short chat</em> Neren thought.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin sat down.  Neren continued playing with the staff as Duror paced around them.  They were quiet and could hear the muffled noise of the conference.
<br><br>
	After what seemed an eternity, Dill Fireshine opened the door to the ranger guildhouse.  Several Wood Elves rushed out and up the ramp that led the to bank.  The Heartwood Master met them, and began to speak in a storytelling manner.
<br><br>
	"It's true: Gonanin, a Half-Elf bard, has killed D'Vinn.  Ambassador D'Vinn is dead!  The Dark Elf that has tried to destroy us by trying to recruit the forces of the Orcs is dead!  We should be celebrating, but no, we can't; life goes on; a group of Humans have just warned us of increased activity in the Nectulos Forest."
<br><br>
	<em>D'Vinn…dead?</em>…Neren thought.  His thoughts seemed to come apart.
<br><br>
	"A Human ranger ventured into Neriak's hidden entrance and came back scorched," continued Heartwood.  "She's with us right now, recovering mentally at a house someone where in or near the rogue guildhouse.  This is too much of a coincidence; we think the Teir'Dal are planning to attack us.  I'll explain the details later."  He frowned.  "Neren and Gilerrin, come with me.  Duror go the bank and get two staves from Neren's account.  Say that I sent you.  Renidyen, your parents might be worried about you."
<br><br>
	Neren's mind spun.  <em>Too fast…too fast…I know D'Vinn…</em>
<br><br>
	"Worried about me?  They're in Qeynos right now!" said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	Heartwood gave him a map, some money, and a passport.  "Hurry, catch one of the new boats in the docks.  It's too dangerous for you here!  Go!"
<br><br>
	<em>What's too dangerous?</em> Neren asked himself.  He concentrated and gathered his thoughts.
<br><br>
	Renidyen was staring dumbfounded at Heartwood.  Heartwood ran to the platform with the main lift.  Neren and Gilerrin followed them.  Neren looked back and saw Renidyen staring after them.  He knew he wouldn't see Renidyen for a long time.  But there was no time to grieve; he reached the main lift with Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	He found many Elves riding the lifts up to Kelethin with foraged food and water.  Guards and volunteers created traps and walls, leaving a few to patrol the city.  Confused tourists were lead to the highest platforms of Kelethin.  He saw many Dwarves distributing buckets of water around all of Kelethin.  Many Kelethin leaders and guild masters were overseeing the work, levitating above all of Kelethin.
<br><br>
	"Here," he heard someone say.  It was Llienna.  She gave him a staff.
<br><br>
	"Is this your gift?" Neren grinned.  Duror must have given Neren's staff to her.  He looked around and found Duror talking to Heartwood.
<br><br>
	"It's a nice weapon: smooth, hard, light, and well-balanced.  Your father was an excellent craftsman.  He was one of the best in making steel weapons," Llienna said.
<br><br>
	"So, what were you planning to give me?"
<br><br>
	"Look at the time, you idiot."
<br><br>
	Neren noticed the sun still low in the sky; it was far from touching the highest tree.  He beamed a foolish smile at Llienna.
<br><br>
	Duror was saying to Heartwood, "…battle?  We should've been warned earlier!"
<br><br>
	"Duror, the war hasn't begun yet.  Within a month we will fight, but we need to prepare."
<br><br>
	"In a month?  Why the rush then?  How do you know that they will attack us anyway?"
<br><br>
	"<em>Within</em> a month.  That's the Humans' estimate.  But I know the Teir'Dal; they are clever, fiendish foes.  I fought in the war where Neren's father died."  Neren winced and rubbed his right eye.  "And with the aid of the Orcs, they can strike us within a week.  In fact, they might be in Faydwer right now - at this moment!" Heartwood continued.
<br><br>
	"Why Kelethin then?"
<br><br>
	"We are hated the most by the Teir'Dal.  After our victory in the Nektulos, I think they would strike us instead of the High Elves.  They obey the law of hate."
<br><br>
	<em>I thought the High Elves also fought in the battle at Neriak,</em> thought Neren.
<br><br>
	"I've been thinking: in order to reach us they will have to pass the Butcherblok Mountains.  Shouldn't we be helping the Dwarves?"
<br><br>
	"Think again.  Why would the Teir'Dal travel along the path?"  He showed Duror a map.  "Here is the main path.  Renidyen should be walking on that path right now.  As you can see, the Butcherblok Mountains are extremely hard to penetrate, although Kaladim reported troubles with the goblins and other monsters.  We think they will come in from west of Dagnor's Cauldron… right here."  He marked an "X" on the map.  "It's the perfect place to gather reinforcements; there the necromancers could harness the forces of the mystical House of Unrest."
<br><br>
	"Why -"
<br><br>
	"Why not defend from there?  Because a Dark Elf stronghold called Castle Mistmoore is not far from us in the Lesser Faydark forest.  I heard from High Elven enchanters that Mayong Mistmoore was communicating with Innoruuk.  I have no doubt that Innoruuk has also been communicating with the necromancers in Neriak.  This link could be dangerous.  If Mayong attacked us while we were defending the coast of Faydwer, we would be massacred."
<br><br>
	Enchanters had the ability to cast illusions.  One spell was called Illusion: Dark Elf.  Unfortunately, these "spies" had to learn the ways of Innoruuk, the "Prince of Hate" god that created the Dark Elves, to interact with others.

<br><br>
	"Massacred… Castle Mistmoore…" Duror trailed.  "Heartwood, I think we have another dilemma.  I heard the Gnomes of Ak'Anon were weakened by a recent Minotaur raid led by a Gnomish necromancer who calls himself Meldrath the Malignant.  The Gnomes cannot stand another assault without the aid of us Elves."
<br><br>
	"True.  We have discussed that earlier in the ranger guildhouse.  We know of Meldrath.  But we need more reinforcements.  Without the Ak'Anon, we only have Kaladim, Felwithe, and Freeport.  Freeport is far though, months away.  The Dwarves have promised to send all available guards and have even said that if they weren't attacked within a quarter day after the siege began, they would send all their guards.  Oh yes, I forgot to mention the ranger outpost out in the Lesser Faydark.  They will supply us much food and water along with their fifty inhabitants if they all agreed to fight with us; no not if - they <em>will</em> come and defend their famous Elven city."
<br><br>
	"What about Felwithe?"
<br><br>
	"The Teir'Dal also pose a threat to them, but Felwithe's marble walls and doors are impenetrable to all save magic.  Magic itself can destroy the city.  The High Elves have posted a few elite guards led by Captain Silverwind though."
<br><br>
	"We are also planning to create an underground passage between Kelethin and Felwithe -"
<br><br>
	"An underground passage?!  Impossible!  Where will it end? In a trunk? That has a lift, leading to the main platform?"
<br><br>
	Heartwood smiled.  "Actually yes. Furthermore, the other end of the tunnel will end at the Nexus of the Art.  We already have a squad of Gnomes and Dwarves there."
<br><br>
	Neren knew that the Nexus of the Art was a strange structure, which was believed to have special teleporters.  Each teleporter transported a person to his or her guildhouse.  Neren recalled that his mother had told him these guildhouses were called "Halls."
<br><br>
	"How long will it take to complete - don't you realize that the Dark Elves might come while we are making this tunnel?"
<br><br>
	"Yes we do.  That's why we have created magical beams.  If the Teir'Dal notice our construction and try to invade it, an enchanter could cancel the beams, thus collapsing the passageway."
<br><br>
	<em>Ingenious,</em> thought Neren.
<br><br>
	"We have analyzed the number of opponents: Teir'Dal, Mistmoore, Meldrath and his Minotaurs, Gnolls from Antonica, Orcs, and undead.  Although vulnerable to fire, since Kelethin is the strongest city besides Kaladim in Faydwer, we hope to convince the Gnomes to evacuate Ak'Anon and help defend our city.  You see, if we were destroyed, Ak'Anon will also meet its fate.  Felwithe would be invaded.  Kaladim will be the last stronghold on Faydwer, but surrounded it will fall.  Freeport would eventually yield receiving not aid from Faydwer, but Dark Elves.  Also, the corrupted guards there would run away at the first sight of an army.   Rivervale and the remaining cities may stand though.  Still that's five entire cities lost!"
<br><br>
	"I think you're being a bit pessimistic," said Gilerrin.  He proudly said the word "pessimistic" as if trying to act mature.
<br><br>
	"Imagine it: thousands of Gnolls, Orcs, and undead and hundreds of Dark Elves and perhaps a couple of Trolls and Ogres versus only hundreds of Dwarves, Elves, and Gnomes.  If Kelethin is burned down with the rest of Faydwer, the Humans at Freeport would be forced to flee to Qeynos.  Antonius Bayle, grandson of the famous Bayle that created Qeynos and had the continent Tunare renamed after him should be able to muster enough forces to protect Rivervale."
<br><br>
	Neren intervened.  "Well how do we know there are thousands of Gnolls?  How do we know there are thousands of Orcs?  How do we know there are thousands of undead?  And if there are thousands as you say, I still think Kelethin is too strong for that.
<br><br>
	"We can just sit around all day, shooting arrows and spells at them.  They can't target us with spells while we're out of sight.  We can disable the lifts.  We have enough water and food to last for years in a siege.  I have no doubt that then others from Antonica will help us.  If they try to burn Kelethin down, we can use water and earth.  If they levitate off the ground, we can easily shoot them.  If they try to burn the whole forest down, let Tunare strike them!"
<br><br>
	Duror wasn't too bright when it came to strategy.  Neren saw Duror struggle to comprehend Heartwood's eloquent statements. Strangely enough, though, for a foolish person, he stored an incredible amount of mana.
<br><br>
	"We've discussed this in the council already," said Heartwood.  "We know that Gnolls and Orcs leave few behind at their home when they attack.  Based on the Humans' estimates, the Gnolls in Antonica number about two thousand.  There are about seven hundred Orcs also in Antonica.  In Faydwer there are more than a thousand and half, most belonging to Crushbone.  Kelethin is not invulnerable -"
<br><br>
	"- I'm not saying it is -"
<br><br>
	"Kelethin is strong, yes, but necromancers can weaken the wood.  I doubt we will have enough water to defend from fire and still have enough to drink.  You underestimate their use of fire.  They have no care for its dangers; they only want our destruction.

<br><br>
	"You must realize that Tunare might not help us.  Wait, let me continue.  If she did, she would bring Innoruuk's wrath.  I don't think the other gods and goddesses would want to join a battle between Tunare and Innoruuk.  Besides, I am sure that Innoruuk has been feeding on his hate all these years.  He may even be more powerful than Tunare right now!  I know she doesn't want to start a war she would lose."
<br><br>
	"You talk as if you knew Tunare herself.  How would you know what Tunare was thinking?"
<br><br>
	"I know you are a great debater, but -"
<br><br>
	Rage enveloped Neren.  His want for revenge for his father's death fed his anger.  He closed his fists a little.
<br><br>
	"Kelethin may or may not stand, but Tunare will protect <em>us</em>.  She would never abandon her children.  Any mother would fight to keep her child, right?  We Elves will survive at the end.  I can't say I know this, but I feel this.  Kelethin may not survive, but its spirit will.  Our memories of Kelethin and Felwithe <em>will</em> aid us in destroying the Dark Elves!  By Tunare, I know she will preserve us.  She <em>will</em>."
<br><br>
	Heartwood was surprised by Neren's intensity.  Neren's eyes began to return to normal, his blue eyes showing through the illusion of red irises.
<br><br>
	"I'm sorry," said Neren, knowing he had been disrespectful arguing with an elder.
<br><br>
	"No, I was just… amazed."
<br><br>
	"So why the staff?" Gilerrin said, twirling a staff around carelessly as if he had not witnessed the recent event.
<br><br>
	Neren noticed a mark on the staff.  "Careful - don't break it or you'll have to pay me its worth."
<br><br>
	"Break it?" Gilerrin said incredulously.  "By Tunare, it's steel."
<br><br>
	"Follow me," interrupted Heartwood.  He led Neren and Gilerrin down the lift.
<br><br>
	Once they reached the ground, Heartwood led them across a hill.  Gilerrin recognized the route.  "Heartwood, we're going to the Ruins."
<br><br>
	<em>Ruins?</em> thought Neren.  A minute later, he saw it.  The Ruins was an old structure composed only of large stone pillars.
<br><br>
	"Legend says this used to be a temple of Tunare where many High Elves came to worship her and nature, but the Orcs set fire to it a long time ago.  Now it is cursed with skeletons.  Gilerrin, show Neren around.  I'll be watching you all.  If you find a large band of Orcs or Dark Elves, run back to Kelethin and report to me."  Heartwood cast a spell and disappeared.
<br><br>
	The Elves looked at each other.
<br><br>
	"So we're supposed to hunt around here?" said Neren.
<br><br>
	"I guess so - do you know how to cast spells?"
<br><br>
	"I think I do, I haven't cast a spell in years though.  The only spell I know is 'Burst of Flame.'"
<br><br>
	Neren clenched his fists and closed his eyes.  Fiery magic enveloped his wrists and he threw his arms up and outwards.  A bat was struck and began attacking him.  Neren easily dispatched it with his staff.
<br><br>
	"How many do I have to kill?" he said.
<br><br>
	"Tunare will tell you."
<br><br>
	"Eh?"
<br><br>
	"You'll see."  Gilerrin tried swinging his staff.  "Ha!  A ranger wielding a staff."
<br><br>
	"It's your only weapon after you two-hander broke."
<br><br>
	"Not anymore."  He crushed a skeleton that didn't know how to properly use a bastard sword.  He gave his staff to Neren and brandished the sword.  Neren strapped the retrieved staff to his back.
<br><br>
	Neren cast Burst of Flame on a giant wasp drone.  Unexpectedly, several wasps attacked him.  Neren swiped a drone away and looked for another target.  Unfortunately, the "dispatched" wasp attacked him again, but Gilerrin bisected it.
<br><br>
	"Ouch!" said Neren.  A drone had stung him.  His lust for battle enveloped him and he attacked the remaining wasps in frenzy.  Gilerrin cut down another.  The remaining three were expertly crushed by Neren.
<br><br>
	Neren gingerly yanked the stinger out from under his right arm.  He grimaced in pain.  <em>Tunare, I should be used to this by now.</em>
<br><br>
	Gilerrin found a wandering Orc pawn that was wearing a tunic that obviously had once belonged to a Wood Elf.  Both Neren and Gilerrin were wearing comfortable leather armor, Neren without a skullcap.  "Anyone need an old tunic?" he joked after crushing its head.
<br><br>
	"You shouldn't be so blunt about someone's captivity."
<br><br>
	Neren realized the tunic must have belonged to an Elven child that was captured by the Orcs not too long ago; there weren't many rips in the small shirt.  He kept it, vowing he would find the Elven slave.
<br><br>
	After killing a few more bats they rested and counted their loot: an old green tunic, several bat wings, and some copper.
<br><br>
	"I feel more powerful.  And I feel stronger!  What's wrong?" Neren said to himself - or so he thought.
<br><br>
	"Thank Tunare for that.  You've just reached the second rank of druids."
<br><br>
	Neren realized he spoken aloud.  "Wow."
<br><br>
	"That's all you have to say?"
<br><br>
	Neren examined himself and found that he was looked physically the same.  He stood up, feeling he was full of mana.  "Full mana."
<br><br>
	"Neren, can I borrow some platinum - I need to buy a shield and polish this weapon."
<br><br>
	"No need, Duror's father can craft any shield easily.  I'm sure he'll make one for you for free.  And for your weapon, ask Duror's sister for a new one.  Anyway lets -"
<br><br>
	"Did someone say my name?"  Duror rushed into the scene.
<br><br>
	Neren tossed him his staff and pulled out the other.  "Help out."
<br><br>
	"What are we doing out here?  Isn't it dangerous?  What if we were suddenly attacked by a Dark Elf?" said Duror.
<br><br>
	"I wish you hadn't said that…" Gilerrin said gravely.
<br><br>
	A male Dark Elf grinned mischievously at them as he stepped from hiding.
<br><br>
	"Stand back," said Neren.  He faced the Dark Elf and went into attack position.
<br><br>
	To his surprise, the Dark Elf laughed and dissolved into a High Elf.
<br><br>
	"Ailaden!" Duror shouted.
<br><br>
	Neren gaped at the High Elf.  "By Tunare!  You thief!"
<br><br>
	Ailaden grinned good-naturedly.  He proudly showed them his 30th rank badge of enchanters.  "Tunare yourself.  Long time no see.  Just came to visit Kelethin and find what all the bustle's about."
<br><br>
	Neren heard a strange sound as if someone was sick; Duror had seen the bat corpses.  "Feeling alright?"
<br><br>
	Duror braced himself for a moment, then said, "I'll have to get used to killing things."
<br><br>
	"Well, it's kinda complicated," Gilerrin told Ailaden.  "The Teir'Dal want to -"
<br><br>
	"Hey, Gilerrin, lend a hand.  I think I heard someone…" hinted Neren.
<br><br>
	"I'll explain later," said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	"He should be alright in a few a minutes."
<br><br>
	Duror threw up.
<br><br>
	"I wish you hadn't said that…"
<br><br>
	"Oh shut up, Gilerrin."
