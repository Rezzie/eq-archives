<b> -- Freeport</b>
<br><br>
"The ground shook so frightfully!  I'm a bit ashamed to admit it...  well, I was so scared that I jumped from my sunny spot on my roof and hid under my bed!" - Poinilla Quickfingers.
<br><br>
Even the most steadfast merchants were sent scrambling to pick up their wares.  Armadillos were found curled up all over the desert.  Tents collapsed, shingles fell from roofs, ships smacked soundly against their moorings and heavily armored knights were toppled.  Theories as to what could cause the ground to tremble so violently are as varied as the people that create them.
<br><br>
"It's that rascal Bristlebane trying to stir things up" - Fernun, High Counselor of the Church of Brell Serilis
<br><br>
"What are you talking about?!  How dare you say such a thing!  You know as well as I do that only Brell would stir up the ground like that.  What sort of trouble are you Brell babies tryin' to cause here?" - Meng, Human... Borrower of Small Items.
<br><br>
The guards were able to break up the ensuing brawl.  Afterwards one of them was heard to say, "Stupid fanatics, don't they know?  It's just Veeshan rollin' over in her sleep."
<br><br>
Well, it has taken most of the morning, but this reporter has discovered the true source of the shaking.  While traveling the desert seeking evidence, I stumbled across a camp of natives.  Not just any desert natives, though.  This was a camp of mighty Sand Giants.  They were all asleep so, grasping my handy drum in case a speedy retreat was in order, I made my way quietly into their camp.  The smell of alcohol was overwhelming!  There were broken casks and coyote bones everywhere.  But the strangest thing of all were their shoes.  Each and every giant was wearing a pair of tremendous wooden shoes...
<br><br>
Research shows that last night was the Festival of the Great Water.  It seems that the desert dwelling giants believe that their ancestors crossed the ocean by putting their feet into the sailing vessels of the smaller races and walking across the water.  So in celebration of the day they set foot on Antonica they drink all night, and at the rising of the sun they put on their wooden shoes and dance.
<br><br>
Thank The Mother that they were thoroughly drunk by the time the sun rose and unable to dance long, or all of Freeport may have slid into the ocean this morning, and I wouldn't be here to report these events.
