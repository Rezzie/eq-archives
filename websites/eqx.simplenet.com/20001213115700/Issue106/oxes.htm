<em>Dearest Oxesiess,
<br><br>
You are the barbarian woman I have always dreamed of.  Come away with me, to the cold north where I shall drown you in the finest Halas ale and we shall dine on freshly killed Mammoth, slain with my bare hands.  I will wear my finest kilt and you can wear [Letter edited for content].
<br><br>
 With all my heart,<br>
 Nomo Orcpealer, Warrior of Love

Hi ya's Nomo.  Welp dat's right kind o ya's and stuff but... I's likes ta kill
me own Mammoth ta be honest.  I's founded dat most barbs slice their mammoth
different in battle.  It all is depend'n on what parts ya's like bested.  Dat
and...  iffen I miss da boat to Halas and have ta swim, it means me armor gonna
be all clean, which is right unbashy.  Now, bout this think'n yer gonna drown me
in stinky ale...  Phaw!  I'll see ya's at da Pit o Doom three days from now and
bashy da snot outta ya's.  Then let's see ya's try ta killed me wiff booze!

<em>Dear Oxessies,
<br><br>
The time of darkness is upon us.  Man and beast shall come together in an orgy of violence that will leave bodies piled toward the heavens.  The sky shall be torn open and Blood shall bathe the world.  And the clerics of all the gods shall join hands in prayer that their souls be spared the carnage of the coming of the end times.  Ai! Ai! Merciful lords save and keep us!
<br><br>
 Sincerly yours,<br>
 Mirez the Baker

Ya's gots dat almost right, but not really right.  O course I can tell yer not
from Halas, otherwise ya's would know excatly where da Sun came from.  See it's
like dis.
<br><br>
Back long long times ago, it was dark except where there were fires round
Halas.  This was a HUGE problem cause up there wiff everything white, peoples
would git losted all da time in da dark.  Dat and it wasn't to purrty which was
da biggest problem.  Welpers da Holy Shamen all gotted together and had a talky
bout that cause some of the Tribe was talkin bout up and moving.  The ones
thinky o leaving were da Doggie Woof-woof raisers.  Wiffout them, peoples would
be losted ferever.  So da Shamen didn't want em to leave and figured out away ta
fixed da problem.  All da Shamen in Halas went all over da Norrath to every
place dat had fire beetles.  Den, all at da same time, dey all slashed every
single last growed-up fire beetle at once.  After dat da leader o da Holy's done
prayed ta da Tribunal while all da other Shamen started another medicine spell.
Together like dis, while da super duper important holy talked ta da Tribunal, da
Shamen did medicine which made all da fire beetle eyes float together.  Da eyes
were so many, and so big and stuff all floatin like dat in a huge round thingy,
dat dey fell away from Norrath and into da sky.  So now, the snow in Halas
changes purrty colours twice day. Oh! and I almost fergetted. Da Doggie
Woof-woof raisers didn't leave.
