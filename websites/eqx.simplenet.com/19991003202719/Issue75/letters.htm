Great and mighty Absor:
<br><br>
okay, I was going to write this completely in character, but then I decided 
that that would be going COMPLETELY over the top; so plain, Pacific 
Northwest English it is:
<p><p>
I've found that the best way to make people "get it" on a server isn't to 
duel them, isn't to chide them for being out-of-character, etc.  All of 
these responses are completely OUT of character for the role-player.  I fnid 
that responding IN-CHARACTER to out-of-character requests is the best way to 
gently nudge others to conform ... for instance, when someone /shouts "Can 
someone give me the /loc to the entrance for Crushbone?," I - as Serona of 
Felwithe, cleric in the service of Tunare - respond with "I know not of this 
loc of which you speak - but if you head due north of the city, you will 
find the fortress of the orcs."  I've responded in character.  If someone 
asks "what level are you?" (I'm /anon), I respond in character with "I am of 
the fourth circle of my order."  Foolish of them if they think I'm only 
fourth level - but if they think IN CHARACTER they'll figure out I'm between 
14th and 19th level.

<br><br>
You can never FORCE someone to behave a certain way in a freeform 
environment; you can only affect your own behavior.  But if your behavior 
and lack of response to THEIR behavior can nudge them - that is the best.

Just to let you know, alot of the taverns do have an in game message
board that can be posted to and read from. My guild is actively taking
part in the Heartstons Quest on Fennin Ro, and this is how we have come
by some of our information and quest clues. So there is already a
working message board of sorts in the game already it just isn't very
well known. Just thought you should know, as this seemed to me to be
what was asked about.

I think that EE is definitely on to something, here.  I really like when people care about what they're doing, even if it is a glorified internet game.  I myself really enjoy Everquest, but I have a plea.  I have long ago shut off OOC, and everything else, till I am down to just shouting and saying.  The problem is, as much as I'm interested in the roleplaying of the game, i still am bombarded by loads of shouts and messages that seriously detract from roleplaying integrity.  I really love your articles about roleplaying the different races, but I would really love something more general.  I think it would be great if you could write an article that encourages Roleplaying...staying in character, keeping the world of Norrath it's own.  I think that a push for people to roleplay better would be well worth the trouble to improve an already fantastic gaming environment.  Let me know what you think.
