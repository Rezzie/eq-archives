"Two left Yvette," he reported. She seemed to hear but continued to
concentrate on the corpse of the Warrior. He nodded and turned to see Bren
coming into view, the Paladin just behind him. The Ranger stopped and began
to fire arrows at Bastion, who nimbly made his way to the Paladin, but not

other for a second before locking in sword play; Shadow Knight to Paladin,
God vs. God.

The Ranger drew close to Yvette for the kill when he heard the summoned
undead raise to life. He swore are turned to fire, littering the unholy
shadow of the Warrior with arrows, hearing the unearthly chanting from Yvette
as the undead warrior closed upon him, delivering night to his world of
trees. Bren died poorly.

The undead then charged the melee for the Paladin, who broke away, seeing the
odds closing on him and called upon the grace of the Light Bearer to defeat
his foes. His sword became bathed in a holy white fire and he cleaved into
the undead, shouting words of holy power, stripping the undead of its flesh
and driving in into the earth. Bastions ears bled from the sound, and he
winced as he drove into the fight, striking the blow that would win the
fight.
