Well, many of you made it easy for me to come up with an article this week.  As I've mentioned previously, I receive between zero and two e-mails a week regarding my weekly rants in EQX.  More often than not, I don't get any mail.  This week it seems I broke the curve.
<br><br>
I would like to re-address some of this mail (No pun intended).  Let's take some of these in the order I received them.  From each of these I will generate at least one question that would be something I would like to know from Verant Interactive and from the public in general.  No truth to the rumor that this one is put up first because the reader said I was…
<br><br>
<blockquote>"…totally right about Everquest and it's repetitive boredom. I totally agree with you and i to will soon be leaving everquest(not because I of your article but for the same reason's).  In fact the only reason I haven't left already is for one reason… What I want is some thing that is customizable yet realistic (I don't think the option of being a troll as opposed to a human is as customizable as choosing hair, eye, skin color's and facial feature's on one race)… You talked about how you wanted an MMORPG like a Pen and paper RPG (which to me mean's a hell of a lot more dynamic quest) so make one…"</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
That is only an excerpt.  The reader also mentions the innate "dorkyness" of P&P RPGs and brings up the subject of Asheron's call (Microsoft's own Massively Multi-player RPG).
<br><br>
First, thanks for the head-swelling words.  I too would like to see more selections regarding character appearance.  From what I understand, each new "skin" they create bogs down the game just a little more.  So I simply pose the question: 
<br><br>
<b>1)  Is the selection of faces and body types limited because of it taxing system resources, or because the artists were told to move on to the rest of the world?</b>
<br><br>
I almost came up with a question regarding questing, but perhaps it will come from one of these other letters.  Here is the next one…
<br><br>
<blockquote>"I read Archnalia's article, "Identity Crisis", and I really made me think. I would like to talk to him about lots of things. Could I please get his email?"</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Oops… No question here.  Just a big ol' pat on the back por moi!  Hehe. My e-mail address is webstudio@earthlink.net I usually reply depending on quantity of mail.  On a slow week you can count on it.  This week, not a chance.  Now for another mail…
<br><br>
<blockquote>"Bravo. Hats off too issue number 81's article. Way too go. I feel the very same way as you. Disheartening as it is."</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Okay, another pat on the back (If you had a shallow opinion of me before, I'm sure I just broke new depths).  Here's the question…
<br><br>
<b>2)  Will we ever be happy?</b>
<br><br>
I just ask this because with all that Verant has smartly crafted, you'd think that we were not capable of satisfaction.  It's easy to sound like a malcontent, not so easy to express what you are looking for and why this didn't/doesn't quite work for us.
<br><br>
<blockquote>"I have to say thank you to Archanalia. What for? For helping me finally find out that I wasn't the only person who was experiencing these feelings of repetitiveness in EQ. I've been wondering if anyone else had been feelings this…[I snip a lot of interesting banter to get to what I want to discuss -Arc]… all I could see on my screen was this non-stop prittle prattle and chatter between everyone in the zone. Not just in /ooc, but /shout as well. Well, I blew my lid, even though I hadn't been role-playing for awhile. I guess all the bottled up anger and disappointment over the RPing ability in EQ had just gotten to me. I began to rant and rave over how non-immersive the zone's chat made the game, and how it was nearly impossible to role-play in such an environment. Then I went on to say how un-immersive the game was, with it's repetitive environment. My rant lasted a few minutes at the most (whereas their public chatter about the latest "real world" topics was nearly non-stop), the whole time I received public flames and comments such as "up yours, jerkoff." Needless to say I was disappointed…" </blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Oh my.  I haven't suffered the barbs of the /shouting public, but that's just because I've seen them get clobbered by the counter-rants of the inconsiderate morons.  I have the example of poor folks like you to keep me from living the same fate.  The sad truth is that there will NEVER be a way around this behavior.  And shouting them down is a self-defeating action.  They pay $9.95 like you do, and they are going to remind you of this if necessary.  The question…
<br><br>
<b>3)  How do we get people to stay in character?</b>
<br><br>
Next letter I print in its entirety.
<br><br>
<blockquote>"I was just reading your latest article called "Identity Crisis". In the ending part it said "So I feel my time with this game and this magazine is coming to an end." I am unsure if this is meant as a sarcastic comment, or has truth behind it, but I would be greatly disappointed if your articles and stories were to end. Sure they might piss off about 80% of the public in one way or another, but where's the fun if it doesn't. I currently do not have EverQuest, but am planning to get it shortly, I was thinking about it but I do believe your articles pushed me over the line. Most of them might be pointing out bad points of the game, and problems with role-playing and such, but I figure, if a game can cause this much debate between players then its worth a look." </blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
First, thanks for the words of encouragement!  I do honestly feel that I can't keep my interest in doing these articles up forever, but I managed yet another week <em>with</em> an article.  Our weekly newspaper has had a number of purposes.  First we wanted to get the gospel of everquest out there where folks could read it.  Next, we wanted to be entertaining, hopefully we'd be informative, and primary to many of us, we'd like to promote change for the better by shaking the EQ playing public into action.
<br><br>
GREAT, I'm glad you are getting the game.  It's well worth the cost.  Next, it's always nice to see that we have such things as "loyal readers".  After all, being in the less respected "bastard" print media  of "the internet", we are prone to think that the attention span of websurfers takes them through our site just once or twice ever.  My editor assures us we get thousands of hits each month, but then he's in the business of keeping us motivated.  Last point, I suppose is that any letter should be considered a good letter (even the hurtful and angry ones) because we've elicited a response and promoted conversation.  Thanks for reminding me that.
<br><br>
Next letter (edited for length)…
<br><br>
<blockquote>"Just had to write and say a big 'EXACTLY!'…Who plays with the same group enough to expose any character traits?… They absolutely must provide more skins for the characters. One night I was with a group that had 2 other clones of my character! Not very fun. Using a different camera view during the battles, I couldn't tell which one was me!  (Archanalia touched on another issue in this section - the lack of gold/xp unless you camp, and the feeling of 'what am I doing wrong' when you see lower-level characters loaded with pricey items - I hear you! I have often wondered the same thing.)…"</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Thanks again.  I guess it's still "ranting" if folks agree with me, but at least I feel better about it.  That was last comment in parenthesis was the thing holding me back there for quite a while.  I'm playing a rogue and I come up to something that is "blue" when I /con it.  I start fighting it, and half way into the fight it's obvious that I've made a poor choice of opponent, as it proceeds to rip me up but good.  So as I spin into the overhead view, looking down on my body, the words come to mind…
<br><br>
<b>4) Blue text my ass!</b>
<br><br>
Well, not really a question was it.  Let's try again.
<br><br>
<b>4)  How are the /CON ratings based?  Purely on level v. monster?</b>
<br><br>
Okay, my warrior character could beat ANY character of "blue" caliber.  Hands down.  Explain to me how this equates to my rogue constantly losing to blue opponents.  Does this rating assume that the races/classes are created equal?  If so, that's a big failing.  From what I recall in all the pre-release rhetoric, Brad himself said that the races will not be balanced.  So how then do a 7th level Fighter and a 7th level Thief each get the same opponent to /CON the same, yet one always wins and the other loses about 8 in 10 times (unless he runs like heck… a highly underrated skill).
<br><br>
And another letter…
<br><br>
<blockquote>"I read your article about the lack of roleplaying. I feel the same way, although im new at this.  I've been playing paper-rpgs for years and of course its impossible to make the game that complex, but i think it could come much closer with just a few minor adjustments. <br>
1. It shouldn't be to hard to dedicate a server for roleplayers. <br>
2. Reduce the number of monsters close to towns. Its actually silly with all these skeletons and bats aimlessly moving about the place. That would also force people to form parties to a greater extent (cause of the greater distances they have to traverse). <br>
3. Awarding experience for all tasks you would perform (not only combat). "</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
I've been hearing about an "RP Server" for about a year now, since long before the game hit the shelves.  Verant's contention is that all servers are "RP" servers.  The advocates say that an RP server would allow for the easy disposal of folks who don't roleplay because they KNOW the server is there for role-playing and therefore they have no recourse against being OOC (Out of character) all the time.  My comment is that there won't be enough room for all the folks who will want to be on there.  So…
<br><br>
<b>5)  Why not enforce the role-playing rule on all servers and have a few "Non-rp" servers.  This <em>IS</em> a role-playing game.</b>
<br><br>
As for creatures close to the cities, just picture having to run all the way to Qeynos hills to kill your first couple of monsters, then *poof* you're level two.  Run all the way back.  Train.  Run all the way out again… etc. etc.  The first three levels go too fast for that, in my opinion.  Besides, if you move the zones out further then there's a greater amount of unused space in the game; Dead space makes for wasted resources.  They're trying to make the game BIG and LOADED with stuff.  Not always the right approach, but I can't argue with their intent.
<br><br>
Good suggestion on that third one.  Maybe you should get Experience for successfully making leather armor.  It could be progressively less as you make more armor, with your 12th suit of armor giving far less experience than the first.  So you switch to sharpening weapons, etc.
<br><br>
The last letter I'll cover was very long (Probably as long as this article) and it very adeptly touched on the players experiences in the game.  Here's the first paragraph…
<br><br>
<blockquote>"I read your article. As per normal, it was well thought out and I can empathize with many of your points. However, I think you've fallen prey to the same high expectations that you've warned against in previous articles (such as Earnest Goes to BB)…"</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
You needn't go any further than that.  You are right that I have begun to expect too much from the game.  It came about in a different way than I had expected it too.
<br><br>
The kind of expectations I was warning about were pretty much those of the dreamers who stare at the screen caps and salivate, taking the press accounts of the game and making them out to be reflections of what they wanted in the game.  I got everything I expected from the game and more.  The problem is that I expected it to all stay new and sparkling to me and that I would always be discovering things.  There isn't much I've discovered for myself now.  On any given night I can go online and type /WHO 50 ALL and I will get at least 3 people who have reached level 50.  At least 3.  And that's just on my server.  20 Servers, averaging 3 each, means there are 60 people at level 50.  Not that hard to believe in a game of thousands.  But it means that with there being many, many people above level 30, the chances of you finding something that you haven't heard about already are pretty slim.  That's where my expectations fall.  I didn't expect to be first to do anything, but I did think I could discover some things before the online sites spilled the beans and the rest trickled down through /SHOUT and /AUCTION channels.
<br><br>
If these letters have taught me anything, it's that every once in a while I can stir things up a little, but more importantly that if I feel alone in my travails, I just need ask the public and undoubtedly there will at least be one other person who feels something similar.  I would like to thanks all those who took the time to put their thoughts in print and send them my way (via our editor).
<br><br>
To contact me, you don't need to send letters directly to me (at webstudio@earthlink.net ) as our editor still likes to occasionally read what's being said and post some on the letters page.  Thanks again and happy hunting.
