The drill is simple but effective:  Angaram drives into the group, chopping
wildly and maiming every gnoll in his path... Janell skirts the edges and
uses her longer stride to chase down and kill those that choose to flee.
The gnolls, though far outnumbering the pair, panic and scatter to the
winds, forcing the adventurers to chase them through the heavy snow banks.

After a few moments of heated melee, the foes are defeated.  Angaram loudly
hums a bawdy tune as he sorts through the bodies, looking for anything of

touching the dead beasts.

"Bah, nothing as usual...worthless vermin" mumbles the dwarf as he
approaches the carts.  "Anything there?"

"Just the usual...meat, hides, some trinkets.  Still, it will more than
cover our expenses with some beer money for you later, though not enough for
women."  Janell chuckles.
