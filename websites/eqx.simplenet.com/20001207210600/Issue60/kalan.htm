"…and that's all there is to it, my bald barbarian friend.  Pick one off and bring it to me."  Kalandriel wanted to slap that sickly smile off the fat merchant's lips, but as a moneymaker this job seemed easy.  And he wasn't bald; it was just thinning from too much time indoors.
<br><br>
"And ye be sure this new creature be dangerous?  I dinna want to go bashing in on a possibly peaceful village."
<br><br>
"Of course, of course.  They've been raiding over the border and raising a ruckus.  All that, all that.  My diviner associate foretold these horns will be valuable.  You'll even be famous, first one to bring down one of these new creatures.  All sorts of fame…don't know why I'm paying you at all…"
<br><br>
Kalandriel raised his hand to stop the fat man's sputtering, "One and half gold per horn, and I'll mention ye to the bards if they can make it this far north this time of year."  
<br><br>
Kalan stepped out into the welcome frigid air of Halas, his home.  Unconsciously, he ran his fingers through his thinning red hair as he strode to the safe house he kept his best equipment at.  "Fragging son of a froglok prolly couldn't drag his bloated carcass out of there even if there wasn't any fighting to be had.  Worthless southerners."  But the soothing wind soon cooled his thoughts and it was with a smile that he donned his chainmail shirt.  "Two days hike, one smack upside the head, if these things be 'avin heads, and three easy gold in me pocket," and with that Kalan slung his backpack and started to lope towards the dale the merchant had described.
<br><br>
He was a striking figure striding through the forest, braided red hair trailing behind.  Under the chain shirt he wore just a padded tunic that left his arms bare.  A simple steel mace hung from his side and a wedge shaped shield was strapped to his backpack.  On closer inspection it was obvious why he carried a mace instead of a claymore.  His face was softer than the typical weather-beaten warrior's.  And while he held the imposing figure of a barbarian that he inherited from his father, he was definitely softer around the middle from too much meditation "and not enough wenchin' " as his comrades put it.  Even now his thoughts were on Quellious as his long stride ate the distance on the second day of his journey just as they had been since he had discovered Her and his need to find what his life was missing.  But his thoughts were jerked back to the forest by a familiar feeling at the nape of his neck.  He slowed his pace and pulled the strap to drop his shield to his hand as he muttered his favorite charms in rapid succession.  Unslinging his mace as he crept forward, he strained his senses to their limit to find the entity he knew was there.  A faint crunching of snow turned him slightly to the left, and a quick feeling for his sense of direction told him that he'd stay down of the prevailing wind.  As the trees started to thin by a silent, frozen river, a figure came into view that could only be one of the creatures Kalan was sent to find.  The creature was an impressive sight even at five feet high.  A head like a cross between a gnoll and a ram topped a body that looked like it would rival a dwarfs for compact power.  Its hairy back was towards Kalan at about thirty yards away as he approached the last of the trees, and Kalan expected an easy victory as he prepared a sickness curse for his prey.  But there was something about the way the creature was standing there that made Kalan hold back his spell.  He (Kalan assumed it was a he) was facing into the wind with his head thrown back.  Kalan could see himself holding the same pose on a crisp day such as this, only with hair instead of stubby curved horns.  So with a quick prayer to Quellious in the spirit of trying something new, Kalan eased his shield to the ground and hitched his mace behind him.  Straightening up and spreading his empty hands before him, Kalan stepped forward and said "Hello."
<br><br>
Before the word was even completely out the creature had spun around and drawn a knife Kalan hadn't noticed.  Resisting the urge of all his charms compelling him to spring to battle Kalan stepped forward and added "I'm not here to fight."  At the word 'fight' Kalan could see the creature tense so he hastily added, "I would like to trade."  At this the creature's eyes merely narrowed.  "I would like a horn..." and the creature's left hand flew to his head in a gesture Kalan found so familiar that he almost didn't notice the creature was advancing towards him with a snarl.  "No no no not yers of course, maybe if one of yer folk lost one in an accident."  Seeing no change Kalan quickly pantomimed something falling on his head and then rubbing it with one hand as he bent to pick something up with the other.  As he held out the imaginary horn he realized with a start that the creature had closed to ten feet, and even more surprising was that the snarl had faded to simple suspicion.
<br><br>
"Forwhat?"  The mouth wasn't quite made for human speech, but the gravelly voice indeed came from the creature.  Without missing a beat and feeling a glow from his goddess Kalan unslung his backpack and knelt down.
<br><br>
"Food perhaps?  I imagine money wouldn't be too helpful but this food is..."
<br><br>
"Firekit."  The creature's slightly clawed hand pointed at Kalan's tinderbox and he was not surprised this time that the creature had edged up while Kalan rummaged through his sack.  "Lugwof can hunt.  Don't have firekit."  Kalan withdrew the wooden, wax-sealed box and nodded.  "For horns.  Stay here."  Kalan could almost here the implied 'sucker' as Lugwof turned and sped off, but he'd be able to buy a case of tinderboxes with his bounty.
<br><br>
As Lugwof disappeared out the other end of the clearing Kalan retrieved his shield to sit on and pulled out one of the scorned iron rations.  "I wouldn't eat this either if I could hunt," he muttered as he waited.
<br><br>
Kalan returned to that river clearing several times in the next month.  Each time he traded steel tools and such for uncut gems and an occasional broken horn to justify his trips to others.  Kalan always made sure to rough himself up when he came back with horns to try to keep others from hunting Lugwof's people, but his slow stream of wealth couldn't go unnoticed forever.
<br><br>
He was at the clearing again hoping to get some information about Lugwof's tribe this time (Lugwof had always grown cold at the suggestion before) when he saw her.  She was one of Lugwof's people, clearly female, and about the same size as he.  She hesitated at twenty yards under Kalan's gaze and slowly worked out "Lugwoffriend.  Please," as she gestured back the way she came. Kalan hurried towards her, and as she broke away he intoned his speed charm to keep up.  Kalan lost sight of the female just as he came to a small clearing at the side of a hill, but he could instantly tell why he had been summoned.  Seated next to a partially concealed cave was a man in full chain mail bandaging his wounds.
<br><br>
"Hey there friend.  Come to join me for a bit of sport?  Just taking a breather here and then I'll wade through them again."  The warrior said with a friendly smile.
<br><br>
Kalan's mix of gypsy and barbarian blood boiled quickly, but he stayed calm as he dropped his shield to his hand and pointed his mace at the object of his rage.  "Ready yourself to see yer god, southerner."
<br><br>
The blond warrior made a show of getting up and said "Excuse me?  You must be mistaken.  I'm just here for some fun and..." and with that his left hand flicked a dagger at Kalan's head as the other hefted his dark two handed sword and charged.
<br><br>
Kalan started to intone the words to his most powerful spell as he shifted his shield to take the dagger.  The warrior pulled back to swing as a greenish black cloud formed in front of Kalan and then jumped into his face.  He checked his swing and stumbled as the sickness came over him, but he turned his dipping sword into a fierce thrust that Kalan barely had time to come out of his trance to block.  Then the battle was joined and the warrior's clearly superior skill was countered by the many freshly bound wounds that were oozing blood down his limbs.  But Kalan didn't have time to wear his wounded opponent down, so he stepped inside his opponents swing with his shoulder behind his shield and slammed into him as he brought his mace down into the side of the man's left knee.  Kalan followed him as he stumbled back a step counting on his shield to handle the expected horizontal cut.  But as the warrior swung he shouted a word that stung Kalan's ears to even hear and the sword bit right through his shield and into his unprotected upper arm.  Pain and then cold lanced through his body as he nearly went down on his right knee but then with a howl he lunged forward and thrust the tip of his mace under the man's chin, snapping his neck back.  The warrior staggered back a few steps with a look of dazed surprise and dropped to his knees but he inverted his sword and leaned on it to keep from going down.  His left arm hanging uselessly at his side, Kalan stalked forward with his mace held high.
<br><br>
"Mercy!  I did not come here to fight barbarians and witch doctors.  I was merely looking for treasure!"  The man looked up and met Kalan's eyes, and at what he saw there he feebly tried to regain his feet to defend himself.
<br><br>
But then the fire faded from his eyes and Kalan said "Then drop your sword and leave this land.  If I catch y' here again I'll truss you up and roll you into the cave you sought to despoil."
<br><br>
"M... my sword?  But..."
<br><br>
"Drop it!"  His hands flew off his sword as if it burned and he staggered over to the nearest tree.  Kalan snatched up the sword and stowed it alongside his backpack as the warrior worked his way from tree to tree in the direction of Halas.  Kalan didn't spare another glance at him as he jogged to the cave.
<br><br>
The sight of the entrance chamber immediately sunk Kalan's heart.  Four of Lugwof's people lay strewn, bloody about the room.  Kalan moved to go deeper into the caves when a slight motion caught his eye.  In a flash he was on his knees in front of the creature pouring his heart into a healing spell to keep him from slipping away.  The blood flowing out of his many wounds slowed, and the major gash in his side had sealed over when Kalan felt a hand on his shoulder.  He looked up into the face of a white haired one of them who pointed to the only hallway out and said "Go.  Help," as he knelt in Kalan's place to bandage up the remaining wounds.
<br><br>
Kalan walked as if in a dream down the hallway and into a wide cavern.  There he saw the female that had found him and she led him into the room of wounded and dying.  Kalan knelt at each one in turn and poured out his prayers to Quellious in the name of simple good.  He helped many, and saved a few, but the strain of healing so many took its toll and he awoke with a start to find he had passed out on the floor from his efforts.  He looked around and saw that the bodies had been taken away, and to his surprise someone had draped a blanket over him and bound his arm.  His wandering eyes alighted on movement from the entranceway as another of the creatures walked in, appraised him, and then motioned for him to get up.  Kalan stood, feeling emotionally exhausted but physically relatively sound and followed him to a grand chamber where a giant for these people stood on a dais adorned in furs and surrounded by warriors wielding swords.
<br><br>
"You are Lugwoffriend?" boomed the leader.
<br><br>
Kalan could only nod, but then, remembering himself, he straightened up and managed to say "Yes, your highness."
<br><br>
"You stop?"
<br><br>
Kalan shrugged off the giant dark sword from its backpack strap and threw it clattering at the feet of his guards.  "Yes, your highness."
<br><br>
At that, the king stepped down from his platform and amid sideways looks and growls from his guards walked up to Kalandriel.  "We thank.  But you not see us again.  More will come.  We go under again."  The king made a gesture and a child ran up holding a golden mace out before him.  "Take this to remember.  Found under."  Kalan gingerly took the mace from the child's hands.  It wasn't pure gold, but some gold colored alloy.  And it was covered with runes he could only guess the meaning of.  "Now you must go.  We leave."  Kalan bowed and stepped backwards as the king rejoined his guards and the onlookers that had gathered started to disperse.
<br><br>
Kalan walked numbly out of the great chamber and was stopped by the female he first saw in the archway.  Gingerly, she reached out for his hand and then led him to one last room.  It was smallish, clearly a living quarters, and a bloodied sword lay against the wall next to a pallet with a fur-covered mound.  She pulled back the top of the fur to reveal the still face of Lugwof, the face Kalan had grown to look forward to, the face he hadn't considered he'd never see again.  Kalan dropped to his knees as she watched his reaction.  Then she reached over to a stone table and picked up a small figurine, which she brought and closed Kalan's hands over.  Then without a word she disappeared, and Kalan never saw her or her tribe again.
<br><br>
Kalan stepped out into an evening that wasn't like any he'd known before.  The chill wind matched the chill in his heart as he set out for home and thought about what the day meant.  "How can this be the way it is meant to be?  Even if I had struck down that lout his dark gods would've thrown him back to the land of the living."  He pulled out the small sandalwood figurine, "But the hands that made this for his wife will remain still forever.  I can't believe that the thin line of civilization that puts us above his tribe is enough to earn us practical immortality.  My people don't deserve that much more than Lugwof's, there has to be a reason somewhere, or at least an ending."  And then Kalan knew the quest that he had been trying to find.  He squared his shoulders and set off for home with his brow furrowed in lines that hadn't been there before.  With the help of Quellious to guide him, Kalan set off to find the End.
