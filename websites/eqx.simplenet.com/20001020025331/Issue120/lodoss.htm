<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
  have been an anime fan for as long as I can remember. For those of you who don’t 
  know, anime is the Japanese word for “Animation”. So, therefore, anime is classified 
  as a cartoon made in Japan. If you are already familiar with the genre, you 
  can skip the rest of this paragraph. Anime is very different from American cartoons 
  in many ways. It covers a wide range of subjects, from everyday teenage troubles, 
  to saving the world from utter annihilation. Unlike American toons, anime isn’t 
  just for kids, as it caters to all age groups. There are children’s shows (<i>Doraemon</i>), 
  and then there are more adult oriented anime (<i>Akira</i>). Because of the 
  wide range, you can easily find an anime that fits what you like. There are 
  comedies, sci-fi series, fantasy, action, historical, and most are a combination 
  of these (For example, <i>Rurouni Kenshin</i> is an action/comedy/historical 
  anime). Anime is very versatile in that even the comedies have some tearjerker 
  scenes in them, while the action shows have spurts of comic relief. Most anime 
  springs from manga (Japanese comics) but every once and a while, an anime series 
  will inspire a manga series that goes with it, and sometimes takes a whole different 
  storyline.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> What 
  I want to talk about is a particular anime, <i>Record of Lodoss War</i>, which 
  is one of my all time favorites. I didn’t see the connection between it and 
  EverQuest until I introduced it to my brother a while ago and remarked, “It’s 
  like EverQuest; you’ll love it.” Now for the story: On the accursed island of 
  Lodoss, which was split from the continent in a battle between two goddesses, 
  monsters have begun to grow in number and ravage the countryside. To solve this 
  problem, six adventurers gathered together. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="cutedeed.jpg" width="331" height="331"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Parn: 
  The young warrior, Ghim: The old dwarven warrior, Slayn: the wise mage, Etoh: 
  The priest, Woodchuck: The thief, and (last but not least) Deedlit: the ultra-kawaii 
  (cute) High Elf. Sound familiar yet? Looks like they have a pretty well balanced 
  group there. Well, they need a bard. The closest thing is when Deedlit plays 
  a lute in one episode, so that’ll have to do ^_^</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Actually 
  based on an AD&D spin-off, <i>Record of Lodoss War</i> is an EverQuest fan’s 
  dream-come-true. It consists of thirteen episodes that revolve around the six 
  heroes and their quest to save Lodoss from the various forces of evil (Recently 
  I discovered that a spin-off TV series was made). These include an evil witch, 
  an ambitious king set on conquering the island, a couple of dragons, and the 
  goddess of destruction herself. With a deep plot and excellent characters, <i>Record 
  of Lodoss War</i> pulls you right in. I’ll use the first episode to explain 
  the series because episode 1 is a prologue to the rest of it. Sort of like a 
  commercial for the series. It starts by introducing the heroes as they enter 
  a dwarven tunnel. Soon, the stone gargoyles around them spring to life, and 
  Slayn uses his magic to hold them off while the others run further into the 
  cavern. Something powerful is trying to stop them. While traveling through the 
  tunnel, Parn and Deedlit get separated from the rest of the group. Just when 
  they are about to reach the end of the tunnel, they awaken the sleeping dragon, 
  and the real fight begins. The “Prologue to the Legend” does an excellent job 
  of setting the scene, introducing the characters, and pulling you into world 
  of Lodoss. But this one episode doesn’t do the whole series justice, which is 
  filled with action and adventure. I especially loved the Dark Elves, and while 
  only one had a pivotal role in the series, they add a sense of intrigue to the 
  whole plot. You can see the years of pent up prejudice and hatred as Pirotess 
  (The sexy dark elf) and Deedlit fight. Some other memorable scenes are the ballroom 
  dance where Deedlit seems to be dragging a bored Parn around the room, or the 
  inevitable battle between King Fahn and Emperor Beld for control of Lodoss.

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
  next part is somewhat of a warning. The series is very different from the cutesy 
  picture I included with this article. <i>Record of Lodoss War</i> would get 
  a PG-13 rating for violence, language, and partial nudity (in the end). None 
  of these detract from the storyline or the overall experience. <i>Record of 
  Lodoss War</i> is an excellent story of courage, heroes, and love. I recommend 
  it to anybody who loves EverQuest, anime, a sirgood fantasy series, or just 
  wants to dabble into something different. <i>Record of Lodoss War</i> can be 
  found at most video stores that carry anime. I recommend the subtitled versions 
  to hear the original voice acting, but the dubbed version may be easier for 
  beginners. I give it a 9¾ out of 10. Only because Deedlit likes Parn and not 
  me >;)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If 
  you’ve seen <i>Record of Lodoss War</i> and are interested in seeing other anime 
  titles, I suggest looking into the following (just some personal favorites):<br>
  <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion<br>
  Rurouni Kenshin<br>
  Saber Marionette J<br>
  Princess Mononoke</i> (In theatres)</font></p>
