Please... keep posting about your campaign! I had a feeling, but until you described your initial adventures....it was then that I knew, you've been introduced to Planescape, cutter! My favorite setting of all time. The webpage I'm working on will actually be featuring some ways to link EQ and Planescape. I'm not going to get into too much detail with you now...you're being introduced in a great way, and I definitely don't want to spoil it ;)

<em>[Ed. Actually, we've done planescape a few times.  It's an interesting setting.  And everyone can blame you now if I don't ever write about EverQuest in my editorials...  :P]</em>
