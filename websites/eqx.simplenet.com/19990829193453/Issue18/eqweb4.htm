Thinking of making an EQ site, but are discouraged by all the sites that seem to be
popping up lately?  Or perhaps you are more concerned by not being able to compete
with the large sites out there.  Well don't because you can beat the crap out of any
of the EQ sites out there, you just have to have a little motivation, creativity, and
patience.  Join me in my the final part of a four part series on how to create an EverQuest
page that will get noticed.

Now you are ready to advertise your web page (if you haven’t died by now waiting for
me to write this last article).  This last article will be of the do’s and dont’s
(or if the Laws of English I know hold true, don’t’s) of advertisement.  Not long,
but to the point.

If you want people to come to your site it might be a good idea if they know about it
(you know?).  So how do you spread the word?  Do you go into #everquest and annoy
Dach with a constant message of "Come visits my page, Bob’s Cool EverQuest page!"
(and if you read my other articles you know I’d have to kill you if you titled your
page this.)?  No, you do not.  It <B>is</B> fine by me if you come in and say "Hey,
I have a new EverQuest page up if anyone wants to check it out".  Only say it once
and people will get the point (hey, I might even put it in the topic if you are a
good boy).  Then if anyone wants to see it you can give them the address.
