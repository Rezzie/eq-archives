	<big><big>"...H</big></big>e appears to be changing.  His teeth grow, the hair on his head and all down his exposed arms lengthens.  He lets out a howl as he drops to the ground on 'all-fours'."

Naturally, at this point every player declares his intent to reach for his silvered weapons or put on his wolvesbane underwear.

What strikes you as wrong with this situation?  If it was the fact that every player knew how to counteract such a beast, then you are in the same boat that I am.   While anyone who has seen a werewolf flick would know what to do, a great deal of the time during a role-playing game the players already know what to do against most creatures, even if they've never encountered one with this character.  Unfortunately, the referee or gamemaster here has just had a bout with "Pre-learned animal killing knowledge" (P.L.A.K.K.).

We've all had PLAKK.  Nothing kills game originality dead faster than a bought of PLAKK.  And sadly, in this world of high commerce, where it is important to companies to make clones of what is already available and familiar, there are few out there trying to cure PLAKK.
<br><br>
If you've been around Roleplaying games long enough then you are familiar with the Achilles heels of nearly every monster in the book.  (The prime example of "the book" being the original AD&D Monster Manual.)  You know what makes a Ghoul shiver in terror, how greed can manipulate many a dragon, and you probably know how to draw an elder sign from memory.  This is all fun and useless trivia in the real world, but when you enter a game with a first level character and you already know how to slay the Demon Lich then your game is riddled with PLAKK.

The obvious cure for such a thing is for the manufacturers of new games, such as Everquest, to rewrite the book.  What if wooden steaks weren't the quickest way to a vampire's heart.  Or better yet (to paraphrase John Lennon) "Imagine there's no [vampires]".  Sound boring?  Not if there are lots of suitably dangerous enemies for you to fight.
<br><br>
Essentially, what I am saying to game developers is "Break the Mold" (Or more succinctly, break the grip of PLAKK).  Games last longer and combat is more dramatic if the hero has to actually work at the solution to the scenario.  Do away with much of what you've seen previously.  No kobolds, no bugbears, no shambling mounds.  And of those borrowed elements that you do choose to include in your game, change their behavior, weaknesses, and make them beasts to be truly feared by players.  With your help, we can stomp out PLAKK in our lifetime.
