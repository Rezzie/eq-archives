<b><u>Role-Playing in Norrath</b></u>
<br><br>
<em>I think that EE is definitely on to something, here.  I really like when people care about what they're doing, even if it is a glorified Internet game.  I myself really enjoy Everquest, but I have a plea.  I have long ago shut off OOC, and everything else, till I am down to just shouting and saying.  The problem is, as much as I'm interested in the roleplaying of the game, I still am bombarded by loads of shouts and messages that seriously detract from roleplaying integrity.  I really love your articles about roleplaying the different races, but I would really love something more general.  I think it would be great if you could write an article that encourages Roleplaying...staying in character, keeping the world of Norrath it's own.  I think that a push for people to roleplay better would be well worth the trouble to improve an already fantastic gaming environment.  Let me know what you think.

   Role-playing.  Taking on the characteristics and personality of another person.  Usually done for the purpose of having fun, as with Role-playing games, but also used for therapy, for the treatment of traumatized children, and as a release from the pressures and demands of real life.  Even within the same frame of reference, it can mean very different things to different people.  In RPG's, like Everquest, for some it means strict rules, the use of Olde Englishe, refraining from using 'out of character' speak at all, or even, as in Norrath, not using the /shout channel, because it is not realistic that everyone in an area that size could hear you.   And I am all for an atmosphere of RP in Norrath.  It <em>is</em>, after all, a RPG.
<br><br>
   But it is also, as Daedhel mentions, an on-line game.  Or, as he puts it, a glorified Internet game.  Hehe.  Literally thousands of people play it, often more than a thousand on the same server at the same time.  And that is the point.  Not everyone will agree with such definitions of RP.  For some, this is too restrictive, and watching what they say and who they say it to, would get in the way of their fun.   With pen and paper games, this is not usually a problem.  The games are among fairly small and close-knit groups of people, who are playing together because they all have the same idea of what fun is, and how they want to play the game.  With EverQuest it becomes hugely problematic to even define RP in such a way that most people can agree on, much less enforce such standards.  The talk of a RP-only server brought to light such issues.  Unlike PvP, which is easy to define and implement, there is no feasible way to <em>make</em> someone roleplay.
<br><br>
   That being said, I fully agree with Daedhel in that a lot of people just aren't making an effort.  I tend to RP fully only when I am with others who do so, but when I <em>am</em> around people like that, I go all-out.  It is tremendous fun, and I respect their wish to fully immerse in Norrath, and leave all real life stuff outside.   While I find it gets tiring after a while to translate everything into <em>Thees</em> and <em>Thous</em>, and it gets somewhat problematic during fights…('Attack the foul beast upon thy left, my brethren.  He seems most feeble and the others mighty!'  'Erm, what?'  'One blue, two gambles.')… still, it adds a whole other dimension to Everquest, and makes the game richer and more (to me) enjoyable.  When people use the /shout channel to discuss last night's hockey game, or the various benefits of troll SK's over human ones, it tends to detract from the effect.   And all too often, a request, however politely worded, gets nothing but a rude response.   Even if they do comply, they will express surprise that you would even care about such things.   I am surprised that they do not.  Even if you yourself don't care to RP, an awareness of the type of game it is that you are playing surely is not too much to ask.   I always keep out of character references and comments to the /ooc channel, or if in /groupsay or /tell, I put a little (ooc) in front of what I'm about to type.  Sure, it takes a bit of extra effort, but in the long run, it's worth it.  
<br><br>
   Without the RP aspect of Everquest, it becomes just another "whack that monster" game, with nothing to charm you but the (admittedly) beautiful graphics.   Verant has put a great deal of effort to encourage people to experience what Norrath could be, were everyone to at least respect the RP aspect of it.  Player-initiated Quests, and interactive ones that the Guide Program will hopefully be running in the future will help to encourage this as well.  Guides, too, in my experience, have made an effort to RP with the players that they are helping, and nothing encourages someone to RP like a dedicated RPer initiating it.  Kudos to Senior Guide Semiramis, who is always in character, even when assisting someone with a technical problem… not an easy task.
<br><br>
   In the end, all we can do is ask, encourage, and give good examples to those that are making it hard to maintain that immersive atmosphere.  It is a free world, and the anonymity of the Internet tends to bring out the worst in some people, but, still, we can but try.  The best way to convince others that RP is an integral part of Norrath, is to show them what a great time we are having while role-playing our little pixilated buns off.  As a last recourse, we have the /ignore (player name) command, which I don't like to use, but have done so on occasion.  Of course, at times it seems that one would have to ignore half of Norrath…
<br><br>
    Go forth, my friends!  Battle monsters, the undead, and, if it be thy pleasure, one another!  Fight evil, or good, as thy nature dictates.   Be courteous, be wise and most of all, be tolerant.   May thy steel be ever bright!
