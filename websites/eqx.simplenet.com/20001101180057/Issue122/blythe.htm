  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Blythe</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Blythe 
  rubbed his hands together quickly, trying to stay warm. A small fire darted 
  in front of him, the flames rising and falling with the beat of his heart. He 
  looked into its depths. It reminded him of the fire inside of him, the fire 
  that had caused him to run away to this forgotten land. He could still feel 
  the hands of his father on his chest. Squeezing the life from him. Only a slight 
  whisper from his mother had brought the man’s anger to a close. Blythe had never 
  imagined that the news of his marriage to Hena would bring this. She was such 
  a frail flower, dancing in the corners of his mind. His father had cried at 
  first. He figured it was from utter shock that the strongest man of the elven 
  lands would become like a child. Blythe had looked at him with the deepest concern.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “Don’t 
  be sad to see me go pa... we won’t be leaving for long... our honey moon should 
  only last a few days.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Blythe 
  saw the color of his father’s face fall from the purest white to the red of 
  the inferno blazing before him.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blythe 
  fumbled with the choker around his neck. The only thing he had to remember Hena. 
  He clutched its emeralds, feeling every contour of the gems. A tear fell down 
  his face and the fire died. He sat on the barren earth in darkness, not caring 
  what befell him. His life’s desire was over.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“How 
  dare you disrupt our family, Blythe! Let your girl know that she is never welcome 
  in your prescence!” said his father, as Blythe reeled back in a stupor. Blythe 
  spun on his heels and fled from the room. He leapt off the top of the stairs 
  to the forest floor. He remembered feeling no pain whatsoever. Blythe dashed 
  across the forest to the other edge. The slums of the high people. He drew the 
  cloak of fur around him as he ran, so no one could report the obvious to his 
  father. As he finally reached the door to her dwelling just above the earth, 
  he sat down to think about the best way to approach the situation. I will tell 
  her the whole thing is off, he thought. He caught his breath and felt a strong 
  determination and courage in his breast. He rapped upon the door five times.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blythe 
  awoke in the morning to the call of a wild bird. It sounded close. He felt for 
  the bow and his quiver of arrows upon the ground in the hours just before the 
  appearance of the sun. Grabbing hold of them, he climbed to the top of the nearest 
  tree. He could see the bird, it was slightly bigger than a raven. He would take 
  it down in one shot to the head. He felt the direction of the steady wind and 
  aimed slightly to the left of the bird. He fired, with a silenced twang. The 
  bird gave a shrill cry of terror as the arrow was sent flying into its beak. 
  Blythe hurled his quiver and bow to the ground in anger. He was a failed hunter. 
  Not to mention a failed husband.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hena 
  answered the door, without a second thought. Rapping upon the door five times 
  was their secret custom for entry. He smiled as she appeared in the doorway 
  in her nightgown. “You awoke me, Blythe.” </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
  smiled despite himself. “I came to keep you company in the darkness of this 
  day.” </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“This 
  darkness would never touch me.” She poked him. “There’s no reason to fear for 
  me.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “Well 
  invite me in at least. Maybe I need protection.” </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hena 
  laughed. “Imagine a meathead like you needing protection.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He 
  looked her deeply in the eyes and suddenly his courage failed him. He turned 
  his back to her so suddenly it put out the candle that she held. He was choking 
  on tears.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> She 
  laughed again. “Very funny Blythe. Wheres the strong man I know so well?”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “His 
  father has killed his hopes and desires, Hena.” He paused for several seconds. 
  He could feel her hand shaking on his shoulder. He felt the need to reach out 
  and hold that hand. He knew it would only delay the inevitable.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “He 
  has said that you are not welcome in his prescence...” he said, turning back 
  around to face her. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She 
  looked confused. “But...”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He 
  held a finger to her lips. “We will run away together. There is more to the 
  world than this dreamless place that we live in.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “Blythe... 
  I will go anywhere with you.” She said, tears running down her face.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “We 
  shall leave on the morrow then.” He said as he disappeared into the darkness.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> She 
  blew a kiss to the night which held the man she loved.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blythe 
  sat in the same tree for three days before his need for drink overwhelmed his 
  depression. He shifted his weight slightly and came crashing to the ground. 
  He felt sore everywhere, but he felt no cuts when he mustered the energy to 
  stand up on weakened legs. He put his head to the ground and began to sniff 
  for a supply of water. He found a faint trace of it westward and dragged his 
  body toward it.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blythe 
  slept the rest of the night in his own bed when he got back from Hena’s house. 
  He prayed that his father had not noticed him slip out. Sure enough, his father 
  was fast asleep in the bed next to his own. He quickly fell into deep dreams 
  where his love for Hena overwhelmed all of his problems, past and future.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
  Blythe finally reached the water he scooped his hands down into it and splashed 
  it upon his face. The cool refreshing sensation made him jump into the water, 
  regardless of his safety. He drank the water that surrounded him and let the 
  current carry him to wherever it felt like taking him.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> After 
  several hours he heard a churning of water and looked about. He climbed out 
  of the water quickly and examined the strange contraption that had almost taken 
  his head off. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Who 
  goes there?” came a fierce voice.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Blythe 
  spun around. “A weary traveler that has come from far reaches of this world.” 
  He found himself facing a man half his own height. A gnome.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
  gnome looked at him inquiringly. “I haven’t seen an elf since my return from 
  your fine city several years ago.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “I 
  never appreciated its beauty. Probably because I have never left its confines 
  before. What is that machine there?”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “Its 
  a hydropower generator I use to fuel my flying machine.” The gnome smiled.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Blythe 
  gaped at him. “Wow.” Was all he could utter.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
  gnome smiled. “Didn’t catch your name by the way. My name is Pinter the Second. 
  After the great adventurer of old.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “Blythe,” 
  Blythe said as he attempted to take in his surroundings. He was in some kind 
  of outdoor workshop. “You don’t practice magic from Pinter’s time do you?”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Pinter 
  the Second laughed. “No. I’m a mere tinkerer looking to better our lives here 
  with new machines. You are welcome to stay here as long as you like if you will 
  help me with the daily chores.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Blythe 
  nodded and grinned. “I will stay here as long as you will let me. This place 
  is amazing.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Pinter 
  lead him to the sleeping quarters which were dug into the earth. The beds were 
  too small for Blythe and he said he would sleep outside. Blythe smiled to himself 
  as he looked at the new window of opportunity he faced. </font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When 
  Blythe awoke, he smiled as he recalled his dreams of Hena. He jumped up in bed, 
  ready to start the day anew again.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A 
  knock came upon his door. “Come in,” Blythe called.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> His 
  mother appeared. Her face looked grave. “Your father is at Hena’s. He saw you 
  come in last night.” She looked at him sadly. “He told me not to tell you of 
  his actions with threat of death. Your father has gone insane with any thought 
  of saving Hena. I would leave now if I were you.” </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  feeling of agony rushed up inside of his body and he barely managed to hold 
  the anger toward his mother for not waking him sooner. He rushed past her and 
  flew down the steps and was before Hena’s door in five minutes flat. He threw 
  the door open. Hena lay upon the floor, blood still flowing from her wrists. 
  He looked at her in silence and removed the choker from her bed, placing it 
  around his own neck. He failed to see a note upon the table. The note read:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Treasure 
    your time on this land, Blythe. I can’t leave. This is my home. Listen to 
    your father and don’t be angry. There is nothing either of us could have done 
    to stop this. I will love you forever.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Hena</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Blythe’s 
  hands shook. He raced out the door in a fierce rage. He could smell his father. 
  He was at home.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Over 
  the first few weeks at Pinter the Second’s workshop, Blythe proved himself willing 
  to take on more than his share of chores, often helping Pinter with his own. 
  He organized the wheels quickly and correctly. He was ten times the cook Pinter 
  was. The list went on.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> One 
  day as he was watching Pinter fiddle with a hydro powered light, he asked, “Is 
  the magic of Pinter the Adventurer truly dead? It is said that it lives on in 
  the city of Yugan.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Pinter 
  shook his head. “That is the stuff of dreams, boy. It is merely a legend.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “Can 
  I try out some of these machines Pinter? I promise I won’t damage them.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Pinter 
  thought for a moment. “Everything but the light. It isn’t ready yet.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Pinter 
  watched for several hours as Blythe dug tunnels through the Earth, looking for 
  metals to be used for the wheels and connectors. When Pinter suddenly seemed 
  tired, Blythe recommended that he should get some sleep.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Pinter 
  nodded. “Don’t take the flying machine out. I’ll see you in the morning.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Blythe 
  kept riding around in the mineral searcher til he was certain Pinter was asleep.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> “I 
  will find you, Hena.” He whispered to himself. A crazed glassy look had enveloped 
  his eyes. He crept quietly to the flying machine. Pinter had posted a warning 
  sign on the side of it. “This machine is totally unsafe and may crash at unknown 
  intervals.”</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Blythe 
  sat down and began to pedal quickly. The flying machine quickly took off, and 
  Blythe found himself rising quickly. He looked into the sun. “I am coming, Hena! 
  He shouted toward it. He grasped the choker around his neck. Suddenly, the flying 
  machine began to sputter and one of the blades of the propellor broke off and 
  fell to the ground far below. “I am coming to join you Hena.” He whispered. 
  He tossed the choker toward the sun and watched as it disappeared in the distance 
  as he fell downward, back to the earth. </font></p>
