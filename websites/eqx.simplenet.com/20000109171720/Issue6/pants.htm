<b>Part 1: FETTP!</b><br><br>
	I was involved in a guild on former world (Meridian 59) and our battle cry was "FETTP!". Understand that while some guilds promote honor and loyalty, we mainly promoted humor and Oreos. Now the story behind this goes back to the days before even the first update had come out. Characters’ feet didn’t move when walking, many creatures were non-animated sprites, and there was only one choice of fashion: Pants or no pants?
	<br><br>
	There were only blue pants for men and red for women. Should you go without pants, you would be clothed in dark brown leggings which faintly showed an outline of a "butt". You can probably guess the style of our guild.
	<br><br>
	Well, one Christmas, several players bought a massive amount of men’s and women’s pants and ran around distributing them at random. Now before, it had always been a sign of our unity to go pantless. However, in this case, our guildmaster was approached by a well-wisher, and, not wanting to refuse the gift, accepted the offer. Another guild member was standing next to him and saw the exchange. There was a very serious discussion going on over guild sends due to the current guild war they were involved in. Not wishing to make a big deal over the matter, the guildmaster said, "He offered. I accepted. That’s the end of it". To which the guildmate next to him responded, "Freak ‘em. Take the pants!" (although the first word was a bit more… er… colorful term). This flashed across the screen of every guildmember and was instantly a classic. Thus, FETTP has been and will always be the battle cry of our guild.

<b>Part 2: The meaning of FETTP!</b><br><br>
	Now that is definitely one of those you-had-to-be-there kind of situations. I was not telling so much for laughs but to make a point. In online games, character appearance, which includes any item which can be seen by others as you wear it as well as facial features, gender, and in EverQuest, race, are an integral part of the online community. This entire event, and thus a big part of our guild heritage, was based on what the programmers probably considered an extremely minor game feature.
	<br><br>
	Whether you have really considered it or not, we are in a completely unique situation in the history of human interaction. For the first time ever, we may enter into a society in which we may choose the face we wear to others. As modern humans are about 85% visually oriented, this is no small thing. Sure, people have been storytelling and role-playing in some form since the beginning of the human imagination. That, however, was dependent on the mind’s eye of the persons involved. There was no way of knowing if the image the storyteller, or participants (players), had in their mind was in any way similar to the listeners or other participants. Now we are able show to others exactly how we wish to see ourselves, or as close as we can under the restraints of the game’s design.
	<br><br>
	Also, many of EverQuest’s future players have common traits. One of which seems to be a voracious individuality. While we do have many common interests (name the Star Trek: TNG pilot episode. . . See? We all know! -- Encounter at Farpoint), I doubt that there are many people who will play EverQuest and not have some totally singular, some would say bizarre, part of their personality. All of this means that we will not particularly like to look like someone’s twin in the game. I believe that, no matter which race seems to the most popular now, the most used races will be those that are the most customizable.

I, for one, am optimistic about these features in EverQuest. This is mainly because the developers seem to be of the same ilk as those who will play their game. They are gamers, and play most of the online games now available, and I’d bet my tricorder that they like anime and cannot wait for the next Star Wars movies to come out. Knowing all this, I would hope that they have similar feelings about character appearance, whether or not they have yet voiced them consciously.
<br><br>
	I would hope that there are a great deal of variations that a player may choose for his or her character, even once they are in the game. While I know that all of this makes more work for the EverQuest team, I would certainly be willing to wait a while on new lands to travel too so that people could better individualize their characters with a huge variety of clothes and weapons. It would be better for players and would especially encourage players new to online games to stick with it, not to mention that it helps to encourage more role-playing.
	<br><br>
	In conclusion, I sincerely hope that EverQuest furthers the playability and role-playability of multi-user graphical online games. I have heard EverQuest referred to as a "second generation" graphical MUD. This implies that EverQuest will draw upon the accomplishments and failures of other online games to set a new standard for the medium. Certainly the importance of pants is not something that any of the first generation of  graphical MUDS could have foreseen, but, hopefully, there will be a whole new world of fashion technology to enter later this year.<img src="eqxpics/smileico.gif" hspace=2 vspace=10 border=0 align="left" alt="">
