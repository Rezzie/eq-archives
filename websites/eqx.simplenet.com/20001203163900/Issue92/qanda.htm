<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been playing EQ for months now. I have two level 8 characters. I love the game, or perhaps I am just addicted, but I have begun to wonder if there is more?  I normally play with two friends from RL. This is great fun but I find it limiting since you pretty much need a group to do anything fun. (Truthfully, the part of EQ that has me hooked is the fact that it is real people playing not just a computer-AI.)  I see lots of announcements about things like "Druid Council Events" and I see lots of people with guild names. It seems like there is a lot of EQ stuff out there that I am missing, but I cannot figure out how to get hooked up with these things. Is there a document out there that explains some of these player-created features? (Verant's documentation is terrible!) Or do I have to convince more of my friends and family to join so we can create our own guild?

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting your friends and family to come play can be a lot of fun, but there really are LOTS of avenues to adventuring with others and participating in events of all kinds.  First, it might help to go over some of the possibilities.  Verant is in the process of building its quest program and open quests are being seen on all the servers.  These are typically not announced so the main thing here is to keep your eyes and ears open for the appearance of unusual sounds and sights in the zones your frequent.  If you see people running madly around and hordes descending on a spot, you'd probably want to get closer and forming a group with others to coordinate tactics.   My understanding is that the quests are being designed so that adventures will be available for players of all levels and all races.  I haven't heard too much about individual quests but gee, I hope there are some eventually.  I keep dreaming of a realllly hard quest for bards where I could earn an instrument that stays in tune and is the envy of all those around me.  Beyond the quests and events being implemented by Verant though are the player-run happenings which are announced on the various websites.  You might want to check daily on your favorite EQ news website (i.e., the official EQ website news and message boards, EQ Vault, EQ Stratics, etc.) where individuals and guilds announce the adventures and events planned by players.  Most of the announcements say when and where and invite you to sign up or show up and you should feel free to do so.  It's a great way to meet people and have fun.  Some guilds, like Soerbaird, also put on plays and concerts to amaze and amuse you and I highly recommend them.  You can also check links from the newsites or search for links to various guild sites and class-oriented sites for other listings.  Here, I'll also put in a plug for good old fashioned friendliness.  If you see a group of people all belonging to a guild, take a few minutes to say "hi" and ask about their guild, what they do and if they sponsor events.  Of course you don't want to ask them about this as Lord Nagafen breathes down their necks, but mostly people plan events because they want others to come and share the fun and you'll soon be hearing the when's and where's.   Finally, if you have a good idea for a player-run quest or event, you might even try planning one too.   I often come across players announcing a quick quest for newbies, sometimes as simple as finding the way across a zone for a helpful item, and think this is another way you would soon meet people to group and adventure with.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I quit EQ several months ago and I'm now thinking about rejoining again but I have two questions that maybe you could answer.  1) How long are characters retained on the server after someone quits? (I want to use my old characters and not start over)  2) Is there some way to change a +pvp to -pvp on the regular servers?  I had heard (shortly after I quit) that GMs had come on-line and were changing people who wanted to be -pvp again.  Is this true or is there some other method.
<br>
Thanks Tenanth
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The official EQ website does have a section on account information and it's my understanding that your old characters are retained on the server for six months even if your account is inactive.  You might want to go to the site to check and you can also email the accounts people on exactly the best way to go back to active status.  As to your second question, Yes, Yes and Yes, you can now return to non-pvp status.  I've heard from friends that each server offers a way to do this so your best bet is to reactivate your character, petition the guides or GM on your server and ask how to get started on returning to non-pvp status.    If you've been gone awhile, you might also want to check old news to see some of the changes and additions to EQ since you last played.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a quick question about skills and how they advance. For example, I hit Level 13 as a Warrior recently. Being a clever fellow, I had saved up several training points. Because of this, I was able to put 20 "practices" into Dual Wield. Now for the question.  Why did my first increase say "Your skill in Dual Wield has increased (33)"? Did I miss something along the way? That had me confused for, well, a minute or two, at least.
<br>
Thanks,GrugarBertoxxulous
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm, this is a headscratcher for me too.    A cleric friend of mine explained it like this:  When you gain a new skill, it starts at a number equal to the level at which you receive it.  Thus, if  you gain dual wield at level 13, your skill level begins at 13 (or near 13) and your practices will then add to it.  Hope this is the answer you are looking for.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;More of asking an opinion than a question. If the new "Yield" rule goes into effect it seems it will be exploited to the max and make a lot of people mad.  For example if I go to Qeynos at level 30 to gather batwings and a level 3 player starts following me around  he or she can keep telling me to stand aside that's my bat every time. This would also be true of necros looking for bone chips and I am sure allot of other examples exist. The way to stop camping is to spread the wealth randomly over a zone not in just one place on 1 spawning mob, not by forcing players  to stand aside.  I would greatly value your views and others on the yield issue.
<br>
Mcduff Frostwind
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, first it's probably a good idea not to jump to conclusions about how the "yield" issue will be implemented until it has been tested out and actually added to the rules.   However, I think that in a worst case scenario, you might run into an obnoxious person doing just as you have described.  On the other hand, even now, many higher levels in need of lowlevel items for spells, etc., add to the local economy by buying up the fruits of newbies'  labor at an amount beneficial to the lower level player.  As my cleric friend said, he "cannot think of the number of times I have seen level 20+ necro's shout, 'Buying bone chips, will pay 1 plat for 20'".    Somewhere at cleric school he must have gained some insights into life in Norrath as he also added, "The yield rule shouldn't turn people into obnoxious jerks, -- some people already are obnoxious and you cannot blame a rule for that."   Let me know what you think of it once the "yield" rule is in place.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to know why I can't get online I can't even get past the third logo with out it closing I've done no bad things I deserve an answer on the reason I can't connect.
<br>
Audie
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure from your question if you get any messages at all as you try to enter the game and what you mean by the third logo so this is going to be a sketchy answer and you're welcome to write with more information.  First, if you haven't tried doing so yet, you might email </FONT><A HREF="mailto:accounts@sony.station.com">accounts@sony.station.com</A> and verify that your account is all set up and working.  Next you might want to reinstall your game just in case.  Assuming you still can't get through to the chat server, you will want to email either <A HREF="mailto:eqtech@verant.com">eqtech@verant.com</A> or <A HREF="mailto:debug@verant.com">debug@verant.com</A> (they'll need your complete system specs and the dbg.txt file), and ask for help figuring the problem out.  If you are getting to the chat screen and then cannot get to a world server from there, it is possible you have a problem with a file in your EQ folder and you will need a fix for it which unfortunately I don't know.  Look for a red name in the chat room or go ahead and mail the addresses listed above and ask for help.  I believe the correct number for tech support is 619-554-0144 but it is a toll call so email or chat help might be the first way to go.  I hope to see you having fun in game soon.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it normal for a bag containing 20 water and 20 food rations and two bandit tongues (Qued's and Keldyn's) to disappear in CB as I was looting my freshly rotting corpse?
<br>
Yilelen
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope, it's not "normal" but it does happen occasionally, especially if the bandit tongues are lore items.  If this happens again, you might want to petition the guides or GM on your server and ask that they "bug" it and also inquire as to whether there is any policy that would allow your disappearing items to be restored to you.   I have heard that sometimes it's possible, although not always, so it's worth a try.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can I get information on learning to research and on what languages I need to read the Wizard's Canon and Doctrine of Wizardy books?
<br>
Yilelen
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't come across a wizard to ask on this one yet, but the informative cleric mentioned above did say that he overheard a magely conference where someone was saying that the Canon takes Old Erudin and the Doctrine might take Giant.  He wasn't sure as eavesdropping is an inexact art at best, but also offered the information that there was a statement in a patch about 4 patches ago that there is an npc in the game that will help with research.   You might want to seek it out for more accurate information.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm curious...  When I cast spells as a ranger, I can't tell how much damage they do.  No message comes up telling me how much damage my lick of fire does, or how much I've healed someone for.  Now, I've played a wizard and noticed that I DO get to see the damage I inflict.  Just wondering if there is something I need to adjust or if I can't tell the effect because I'm a ranger.
<br>
Adaanya
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rangers seem to have to guess at the damage or healing they do although it seems like on the healing you can ask someone to watch the hitpoints over several heals and come up with an average heal amount.  Is lick of fire a DoT spell?  (Sorry but although I enjoy the company of many rangers, mostly I'm flirting with them and not paying attention to their skills so I don't know the spells they have very well.  Blush!)   If so, there used to be a way to test DoT damage by casting the spell on yourself.  However, with the recent patch,  casting spells on yourself is considered PvP combat and the spell will not do its full effect so you'll only get an inkling I think.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an question which has grown from the topic of moving from one server to another.  If one has several characters on one server then makes a character on another server, do the characters on the first server remain accessible?  may your songs never end on a sour note.
<br>
Kelledrian
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep they sure do, so you actually have the option of filling up your character slots for every single server in Everquest.    That would be a lot of characters to keep track of, of course, but think of all the bards you could play.  *Smiles merrily at you*!
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do paladins get such a bad rap?  I have had just about every class in the game (except fellow paladins) taunt me for being a goody two shoes!  Also, people accuse me of being a non-roleplayer because I group with necromancers and shadow knights.  Normally, they would be right.  However, my guild's charter asks us to put aside racial and class hatreds.  What can I do to put a stop to this abuse?
<br>
Kiratesl Dwarven Paladin of the Eleventh CircleRealm of Solusek Ro
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think you might have a shadowknight lurking somewhere in your psyche?  It sounds like that might be just the character to play to consort with evils as it is hard to imagine any paladin overlooking the evil and perversions of necromancers, ogres, trolls or shadowknights in true RP fashion.  However, you could possibly still meet your guild's philosophy if you only grouped with the dark side as an attempt to convert them to the wisdom of your Paladin heart.  Not to say they'll accept such an attempt; in fact they might just decide to have you for dinner, but at least that is one way you can stay true to rp'ing a Paladin.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi,  This may not be a question you can answer but Several weeks ago, while traveling through the Butcher Block Mountains, I was attacked by a pair of Dwarves.  Now I am a High Elf Mage and this had never happened before in Butcher Block.  I was lucky and won that battle but now I am perplexed.  The Dwarves dropped an item I am sure is for a quest but I have been all over Kaladim and can not find who to give it to.  Can you help me?  The Item is Glynn and Glynda's Tongue, kinda gross.  Thank you for any possible help.
<br>
Ollimonger
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eeewwwww, gross is right.  Hmmmm, tongue is said to make good sandwiches and ogres and trolls enjoy making a meal off dwarves but that sounds like something more for the Joy of Norrathian Cooking cookbook than the solution to a quest.   Truthfully, I have no idea what you should do with Glynn and Glynda's remaining bodily part but would suggest you keep asking players in the general vicinity as others may have some insights to share.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a Question, not an Answer, but more of a..... hint.   My roguish friend I saw one day while wondering around North Ro told me something very interesting.  I had recently told him that I was not liked by some of the dwarves in Kaladim, so unliked that they would not sell to me!  He told me to literally 'sneak' behind them and then try to sell to them!  He told me it works for him, so it should work for a Monk like me.-Aalon, 15th lvl monk, Veeshan    (OOC): The Rogue is actually my other character named Athek.  To get the vendors to sell to you, you must have the ability to Sneak.  Probably all non-casters get it sooner or later.  Click 'sneak' and if you walk slower than normal, it succeeded (Rogues get a success message, something to the effect of 'You are as silent as a cat stalking its prey'.  However, no one else does).  After you sneak, walk up to the NPC and right click them, they should sell to you.  Sneaking makes their con be 'indifferently' I think.
<br>
Aalon
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, sneaky, sneaky rogues!  Thanks for the hint and I suggest using it with the natural caution and care that rogues apply to approaching any and all npc's.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed the question about how to know what your skill level is - I agree that you need to write it down, but if you're fortunate to have a handheld computer such as a Palm Pilot, you can usually keep track of these things with the memo list.  Bahzell in Errollsi Marr has maxed out 1H Slash, Abjuration, Alteration, Channeling, but can still work on divination and certainly his tailoring at 21 isn't going to do reinforced armor anytime soon.  Holderman in Rodcet Nife needs work on almost anything.  Evark in Brell Serilis has some stuff he needs to work on, but his dodge and piercing is pretty good.  And so forth.  I bought the damn Palm V thinking it would be good for business, but instead I'm keeping it at home for tracking and doing stuff with my EQ stats.  :-)
<br>
Bahzell (or other characters from David Weber's novels)
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like a good idea and more compact than the 15 gazillion computers some players keep going all at once.  Thanks for writing in.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to: How do I check to see how my skills are progressing numerically -- I look at the skills chart in my persona regularly, and see feeble, below average, etc. -- is there a way to see the numbers except for when they advance? If you download EQ parse and do a /log, this will create a log file that you can open in EQ parse. EQ parse(or others) will give you a total of how many skill points you gained and the last skill value.
<br>
Hatep
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for a solution for those of us using the mono-computer approach to playing Everquest.  For those who might have missed the posts, most of the news sites carry information on the parsing software and offer a link to download it.    This might be a good time to say thank you from a lowly bard to all those who offer advice and software helps for people like me in the community of Norrath.  I know, I know, I owe you a song or a ballad on it someday.  But for now, thanks!
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;An addition to the Quiver comments.  When you have any item in your range slot, it will pull from the ammo slot and then from anyplace in your inventory.  For a Monk, I would purchase 20 for each Range slot, and then another 40-60 to carry in my bags/packs.  Thus, I had access to 80-100 shurikens and would never have to place any into my range slot until I completely ran out and purchased additional shrurikens.  With this knowledge, I consider quivers to be useless.
<br>
Thayn
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we issue a challenge to Verant to secretly implement some really cool reason for quivers to exist and keep it secret to see if anyone finds out?  I think so!  So here goes (clears her throat and strums mightily on her lyre), " Verant, if anyone is listening, we challenge you to do something very very cool to quivers!   You don't have to ever tell us if you do modify them, but oh, it would be fun!"
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just wanted to add this to the lost exp question. I have paid close attention to this since release since I tended to die a lot due to trains at the beginning. 1)If you take on something your level i.e. lizardman at level 11 and get killed you loose normal exp. If you do this and 2 more lizards jump in and you get killed you lose normal exp. If you do this and they jump in and you RUN LIKE H*** you lose only marginal exp.  2) You sit on the shore of Oasis and along comes Mr SG and you sit and die so much for exp. normal loss. If this SG hits you and you run...normal loss. Now, if this Mr. SG is chasing someone and gets "dumped" on you (by accident or not) and you run like heck and die. minimal exp loss. If you stay there..normal exp loss.. Yes, I have died A LOT. lol  3)Last one. If you take on a solo and he gets some buddies and you think he's almost dead let me try, then turn and run and still die..normal exp loss.  It seems as if you react accordingly you lose less exp. Bite off too much and you lose normal. If you die from a train and you ran you don't lose as much as if the train were yours. Take something your size, get ganged up on and run you lose less. Push your luck for that high exp gain and then decide to run, tough luck normal exp loss. I consider what I did justifiable suicide so I hope it helps someone.  &lt;g&gt;
<br>
Nesolak
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, its seems like you have made a science of the art of dying well.  Grins back at you.  Thank you very much for writing in and setting out your experiences and knowledge.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 91 you mention that monsters that con indifferent will sometimes attack... for me this has always been due to forgetting that I am invisible.  If you're invisible everything cons indifferent.
<br>
Brack of Atlantic
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good point and thanks for writing in with the reminder.   I'm not sure but somewhere I remember seeing something about even "indifferent" monsters having a teeny chance at attacking you but that could have been in a place for away and a time long ago.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a glowers at you menacingly :)
<br>
Chris
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ack, ok, everyone add "glowers at your menacingly" to your list if you don't have it there.  Thanks for writing.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a baker, I want to move on to pies, muffins and such...Is there any where to buy Pie tins and muffin tins?  I am on the Tribunal Server.  I would hate to think that in order to make pies and such I am going to have to become a potter as well! Can anyone give some help here?
<br>
Yanic
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure if anyone writing in about baking addressed this specifically or not but if the merchants haven't figured out that they can make money selling pie and muffin tins, you gotta wonder about their inherent intelligence.  I'd be glad to say if tins are available for purchase from merchants in Norrath if someone wants to write and let me know, but I plan to stay away from exact locations or spoiler hints.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding baking pies, making dough is actually quite easy, if you know the recipe. Dough is made by combining a snake egg, one flour and one milk in a mixing bowl (not a spit or oven). The difficult part is finding eggs. Either kill a lot of snakes or find a merchant to whom another person has sold a few eggs.   Making pies , however, is a little bit harder. It is not trivial even for a Master Baker (say that carefully!) Meat pies can be made by combining a chunk of meat, pie tin and a clump of dough in an oven or a spit (no spices!) Whether it succeeds or fails you will get the pie tin back, provided you used the correct ingredients. Berry and fruit pies are much the same. Fire beetle eye pies are the only pies that require spices.  For extra credit, talk to the fisherman in the Qeynos hills to learn how to make rat ear pies which require no dough or pie tin!
<br>
Faedor of Erollisi Marr
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing.  Others sent in similar advice last week but I'm including your letter just in case someone missed the last issue.  What do fire beetle eye pies taste like and do you glow after eating a slice?
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a response to the pie questions of #89, 90.   First to make a clump of dough you combine, in a MIXING BOWL: cup of flour, milk and snake egg   The pie recipes are incorrect. Do not use spices.   I have made meat, berry, fruit and vegetable pies.   So for a meat pie you would combine a clump of dough, chunk of meat and pie tin in a oven.   If you fail you get your pie tin back. If you succeed you get your pie tin and 3 meat pies back.   They are tough to make. My skill is 118 and I'm around 60 success I think.
<br>

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for including the comment on difficulty.  Sometimes that helps people know if they are on the right track for skills and success.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;WOW!  Thanks for all the great help with my pie-making problems!  Indeed, I was foolishly attempting to mix the dough sans MIXING BOWL.  Perhaps that explains my numerous charred gloves. ;-)   Since so many great folks chimed in with help - I thought I'd pursue another area of trade skills I am having problems with - TAILORING.
<br><br>
I have maxed patchwork and begun to sew Studded armor - certainly not for profit, as there are few buyers - but to increase my skill.  I believe my skill is somewhere in the low-mid 20's and I cannot train it up, so studded I must try.  Luckily, I have two friends who smith me free studs but I have wasted 4 backpacks full on one successful studded gorget.  What's worse, I HAVE NOT GAINED ONE SINGLE LEVEL in the 16 tries of studded!  My INT is base 75 (79 with Black Iron Medallion) - certainly not Mensa level, but adequate.  My question to fellow tailors is simple - is Tailoring worth the effort?  At least with baking there are some funny recipes, but I see no use for Studded/Reinforced armor with the relatively easy access to banded/magical around.  Before I waste another 32 studs for no level gain - I would like some second opinions on the skill!  (I'm not here to get rich - but I'm certainly not looking forward to wasting time either!)  Also - can ANYONE explain why a failed tailoring attempt results in the loss of METAL STUDS?  Please explain the physics behind the destruction of a metal stud by a needle and thread?  I can understand if I shred the medium quality skin to pieces, but I should be able to recover the studs!!!  THANKS ALL!
<br>

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad all the folks writing in helped you.  Work has started on the above-mentioned "Joy of Norrathian Cooking" but the completion date is far in the future when my tasting trips have included more of the realms.   In the meantime, tailoring is a fit subject for this column.  (Oooh bad pun!)  If anyone has comments for Coventina, that would be great and if anyone can find this bard a pretty dress I can wear, I guarantee you at least a limerick in thanks.   Maroon or dark blue would go well with my complexion and eyes!
<br><br><br>

Thanks again to all who write in both with questions and with responses that help answer other queries.
