As a preface, this "activity" is recommended for the seriously bored role player, as well as those that would like to develop an interesting role. I really wish Ayrent was around to help with this article, since his old article on this same basic subject really would make a great preface to this. The point is to help draw a better picture of your characters persona. I warn you, this is silly, illogical and downright fun.
<br><br>
I did this once in a history class when looking at anthropology, and drawing conclusions on how a historical figure would live in the 20th century. Take it to a RPG level, and think of what a fictional person would be like, strange races and all. This is an easy theme for fans of some comic books that are based in modern or post modern times. Take your character idea, and ask yourself - and others; what would he be like today? What kind of car would he drive? If he had a job, what would it be? Likes? Dislikes? Taste in music?
<br><br>
For example let's take a Troll. I think of a Troll's basic characteristics and think of the world around me. Slowly the vision of a red-necked laborer comes to mind, one who spends a lot of time in the local arcade and at drive in movies. With this I see beer, and bad taste in clothing, and an aura of filth about him. He probably has a very old beaten up Ford Pickup that is only describable as rust colored. He works on it often, and the neighbor parents warn their children to stay away from his yard.
<br><br>
I didn't have to put much thought into it, and I don't really have to think of someone I know. Basic rule of humanity will be that you draw on your surroundings when you role play anyway, so this is not much different. It is indeed silly to take your character development to this level but you would be amazed at what you can come up with for interesting quirks. 
<br><br>
Think about the car they would drive. It has always been a humorous subject to talk about how a car seems to tell about a person, or the feminists toy to torture men about their sexual habits. Whatever. You can be simple about it if you want, like saying your dwarf drives a Yukon to make up for his size, or can get funny about it by saying your Bard drives a Winnabago (sp) and lives at the beach.
<br><br>
Take what you think about those vehicles (perhaps you always get cut off by the same guy driving a Jeep Eagle every morning who reminds you of a gnome) and let it kinda take you through daily life. For me the next logical thought is either about the workplace or someplace in town. You can let the tangents play themselves off but you should keep a few of these certain questions in mind.
<br><br>
The end result should be a real world counterpart of some manner that you can think about when modeling a character. A dark elf could be a corporate raider, who drives a Viper and only dines from professional catering services. Whatever you imagine, this should be a simple process that is not too deep. Keep in mind the whole point is to use your imagination, not to model a character after your co-worker and kill him.
<br><br>
I cannot possibly write this article without mentioning music taste. Many players put in music while they game, since game music rarely outlives the first month of gaming. Even power gamers can attest to certain music fitting a style of gaming. Well, I cannot recommend buying the Peter Paul and Mary collection just to better role play your Elf Bard, but having it cross your mind once may be enough to spark an interesting characteristic. 
<br><br>
ZZ Top is an excellent example of a modern band that has a unique sound that might be easy to identify a RPG character with in the 20th Century. Many kiddy rock bands have absolutely no sense for a RPG element but some are laced with it. We all know these bands, the ones that seem half way into that other dimension. Fans of White Zombie call on the rich mixture of race cars and cheap movies about the undead. Also, try picturing a Dwarf or an Ogre running along with the Mmm-bop stuck in his head, singing aloud very poorly. At very least, whatever you come up with should be humorous. 
<br><br>
The trick might be to transition back to Norrath without taking the Boyz to Men with you, and leaving your car and gold chain necklace behind. Once back in Norrath one should have perhaps a few quirks or things about their personas that were normally not there before, as we adopt a few behaviors and such from the world around us. In my history class, we did this just to get a very rough unprofessional idea at what life might have been like for that historical person. If you think about it long enough from a relaxed point of view, it is not only fun, but interesting.
