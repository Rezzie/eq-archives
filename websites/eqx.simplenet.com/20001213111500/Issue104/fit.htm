"Get out of my office!"
<br><br>
That was the only thing that King Ak'Anon had to say regarding the situation.
<br><br>
What is the situation?  Well, that's what many people are trying to find out.
<br><br>
Someone has been kidnapping Gnomes.  There have been very few clues left behind.  Some bits of white fur, or hair, have been found in the homes of the missing Gnomes.  Often all of the snacks in the house have been eaten, and all of the milk drunk.
<br><br>
All of the missing Gnomes are tinkers of some skill.  Also missing are their tools.
<br><br>
The wife of one of the missing Gnomes tells us that she saw an Ogre in her bedroom, all dressed in rubicite armor.  She claims that he muttered something like "Useless Elves..." and "Can't keep up with the demand...".  However, authorities think that the poor woman was delusional with grief.
<br><br>
If anyone has any clues as to the missing tinkers, please contact the Ak'Anon guards.
