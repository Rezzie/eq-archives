So what's next?  Ultima Online was a success.  EverQuest is a hit.  So what's next for this genre?  Asheron's Call?  Well, despite what they say, it's not going to be all that different than the rest.  I'm eagerly awaiting Neverwinter Nights.  I've heard the good reviews about the company, and I've read some of the promises about what it will be.  But it's still a fantasy based game, and not even a massive mulit-player one at that (though I think it's just for that reason that I'm so interested in it).  No, I mean what's next, after the fantasy fetish dies down?
<br><br>
Think about it…  how cool would it be if Norrath was just one planet of many, and we were a space fairing people, there to exploit it's wealth?  Sure, the programmers would have to remove the Gnolls and replace them with wall-eyed, four legged, tentacle-enabled, blaster-wielding, scaled freaks from Xethos Three, but that would be half the fun.
<br><br>
Picture playing in Niven's universe.  Picture meeting the Puppeteers on some distant planet.  Imagine the thrill of 'zoning' onto a ring world or, better yet, a sphere world.  Or tromping around in Brin's Earthclan universe?  Imagine making your character.  Will I be an asteroid miner or a corporate raider?  Shall I be a methane breather or a stock human?  Or maybe a Dolphin?  Do I want to learn computer skills or combat skills?  Blaster or laser?
<br><br>
I envision a space game where there are worlds like Norrath by the dozen.  Hey, did any of you every play Star Saga?  My brother and I used to play the heck outta that game.  The idea was to travel from world to world, system to system, and trade items or defeat enemies to better your ship and gain enough power to… save the universe?  I forget, since I didn't have the patience to finish it.  That's kinda what I'm thinking.  Characters would start on their home worlds, pecking around like they do now in Norrath, battling the forces of the world in order to earn the money for passage to another world, or to own their own ships.  These ships would take you to other planets, much like the ships in Norrath take you to other continents.
<br><br>
I've been wondering for the longest time now why it is that I've heard nothing about anyone at all building a massive multiplayer game on another genre.  Why fantasy?  I'm quite certain that a science fiction world would be just as popular.  It wouldn't be all that different, really.  Change the effects a bit and Flare becomes a plasma bolt.  Add a lobbing grenade visual and you can use Shock of Force is now a shock grenade.
<br><br>
Well, I do see a few hurdles that would probably have to be jumped first.  Two big ones.  Vehicles and flight.  You'll note that Norrath has neither.  Boats aren't really vehicles, though the rowboats are a darn good start.  I'm pretty sure a landspeeder or pod racer isn't out of reach there.  But flight is a bit stickier.  Those in beta may remember flight.  I got to do it once in Norrath.  At the time I didn't know the controls, so I just bobbed up and down.  I could maneuver myself to the edge of Kelethin to jump off.  The next day, Flight became Levitate.  I was so bummed.  But there's a reason that flight is a real problem in these games.  If you can fly, you can find all kinds of ways to break the system.
<br><br>
How does a Pincer Beetle deal with someone that it can't reach?  How would any non-flying, non-tool using creature deal with it?  If we though Kiting was bad…  And once you add that third dimension, you start to have AI problems.  Pathing becomes a problem in space.
<br><br>
I'm sure there are other hurdles.  But I still can't believe that nobody is out there right now making a non-fantasy game.  A clever designer would be able to tackle the technical issues, especially if they are aware of them.  An even more clever company would have noticed that nobody else is making anything but the tried and true fantasy game.  Where are the visionaries?
<br><br>
But what I really want is a superhero game.
<br><br>
Now there's a fun place to play.  'Zones' like Metropolis or Gotham.  Epic battles in the streets with giant villains.  I picture a game where you get K.O.ed, not dead.  If you 'die' you get knocked out, and most villains leave you alone.  You wake up later, having been dragged to safety by the citizens.  Much like Middle Earth was supposed to be doing, you could die, but it would be rare, and permanent.
<br><br>
Someone tell me how to get the start-up capital and staff so I can start designing games.
<br><br>
Where are the visionaries?  If anyone knows of a massive multiplayer online game that is upcoming and is NOT a fantasy game, please let me know.  I still love EverQuest, but I really see some untapped potential out there.
