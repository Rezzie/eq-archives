OH S$%,<br>
What more can I say, What a plot twist!!!! A story in which I can hardly
wait to read the next issue has now become something even more to be
desired. I can not say enough to Praise the wonderful writing ability of
Aklar. What I can say is please oh please do not let Aklar stop writing for
EQX.

I have read <a href="../Issue83/letters.htm">Tetsujin's comments</a> on AC and comparing it with EQ. I'm also
part of the beta test, and here are a couple of observations I have
made:
<br><br>
1. The character customization
<br><br>
Yes, you can customize your character, but it's quite as great as it
sounds. The skins are a bit basic in AC, and the characters have a
slightly cartoony appearance.
<br><br>
2. Creature placement
<br><br>
Yup, creatures are more spaced out, but to tell you the truth, I feel
this is a Bad Thing(tm). In EQ, you start in a city zone, and (with the
exception to Kelethin I think) you zone once, and you have an area
filled with monsters. Very nice, because it doesn't mean you spend the
next 10 minutes for some more decent prey like in AC (Note: I haven't
been to many of the dungeons in AC, so it may be different there...).
<br><br>
3. The question of grouping
<br><br>
I have to agree on this point, solo'ing in AC is easier, but I have also
just started to do some serious grouping in EQ, and it is ALOT of fun,
and  I originally thought this was one of the main detracting aspects of
EQ...
<br><br>
4. Graphics
<br><br>
With all respect, the graphics in AC are, erm, a little on the bland
side. Tree's in EQ look very nice, vary in size, and appearance. In AC,
the big groups of trees are more akin to orchards.
<br><br>
As I said earlier, the skins are a bit basic, and the monsters
themselves are very low poly meshes, making them look a little silly
sometimes. No zoning is cool, but the horizen graphics arn't as good as
EQ's, and EQ beats AC's weather effects hands down. Or at least I think
so.
<br><br>
5. RPG factor
<br><br>
Can't really comment much on this, as I tend to avoid role playing. When
in a party, talking about experiences in real life, while waiting for
the HP and mana to go back up appears to more fun, and appeals to more
people...
<br><br>
So in closing, is AC better than EQ in my opinion? No, not yet. Note the
not yet. It has the potential to fix alot of problems that EQ suffers
from, and bring in some new unique skills, ie. You don't get spells
perse, but mix your own spells using various ingredients. This is a very
fun thing to do...kinda like research in EQ, except not as
expensive...:).
<br><br>
Still an EQ player,
<br><br>
Matt.

Oghma! Oghma! Oghma!
<br><br>
 (Hahaha)<br>	
  I just wanted to mail you and explain how happy I am that oghma is still 
writing for you folks.  I especially liked this months <a href="../Issue81/edito.htm">editorial</a> over game 
playing and the lack of feeling to do so nowadays.  I also and stricken with 
that "Multiple Character Syndrome" and all my friends hate me for it..  
(Always getting the "what char are ya gonna play today?  Oh, it's another new 
one?  sheesh" line..  Ack)  I like playing for playing, not obtaining rare 
items and trouncing the same NPC's time and time again..  All my characters 
slay what they feel that they HAVE to slay, that's it.  Oh well..  I must be 
one of those sheer minority players, haha..  <br>
			Thank you for another wonderful installment.  Send my 
happines to Oghma!
<br><br>
<em>	I'm hoping that I'm in a temporary holding pattern with the MCS - I played Oghma all week.  The highlights have been as follows: Remembered to train dodge (which I got at 15th level) when I made 16th.  Slain by D'Vinn 5 times.  Saved 12-15 people from being slain by D'Vinn.  Acquired Crushes tunic. Had fun!
<br><br>
I know it's just a matter of time before I re-visit another character, but Oghma has been a blast this week.  I just hope I don't start a new one and continue with one of the ones I already have!
<br><br>
