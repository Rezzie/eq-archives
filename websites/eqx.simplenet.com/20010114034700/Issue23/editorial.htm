<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 23!</font></p>
<p align="justify">
I figure you are all tired of my rants about my D&D roleplaying sessions.  I know my
GM is.  I torture him with them each week as a reminder that his players still have
some minor methods of striking back at him, other than the usual bodily harm.
<br><br>
Besides, we didn’t play D&D last week.  One of our exiled players was allowed to
return for a weekend, so we used that chance to play an unfinished Vampire game.  Ok,
he wasn’t exiled, he moved to San Francisco.  But he was back in town and we stole
him from his girlfriend for a night of gaming.
<br><br>
You may remember that I mentioned that there was a tendency in our black-hearted GM
to use our backgrounds against us.  You may remember that I find that to be the only
way to bring any real life into a campaign.  It might be time to that I rethought
that opinion…
<br><br>
Because I want to get back to building my new ubercomputer I will spare you the gory
details.  Let’s just say that we all suffered.  In fact, the only survivors were
kindred.  Dozens of ghouls and over a hundred mortal servants were massacred by
werewolves.  The oldest ghoul in the campaign, mine of course, was killed holding
off a Gangrel methuselah so that I could escape.  The rest of us got out with a lot
of luck and a little cheating by the GM.
<br><br>
What?  Our demon-possessed GM cheated <em>for</em> the players!  Yes, he did.  You see,
it’s not fun for him or for us to lose any large majority of the PCs in any game.
Sure, PCs die.  Tragic singular events that make statements or turning points in
campaigns.  But if a large number of characters were to die the whole game, the
story, would start to unravel.  And it would be one big giant bummer. So we see a
minor bit of cheating.  The methuselah did not pursue us after destroying my faithful
ghoul.  Certainly he could have been more lethargic than angry.  Or the fact that our
other Thaumatergist was able to transport the whole group by flight, despite it being
a bit beyond any magicians power to carry that many that far.   And let’s not forget
the lupine that managed not to find us despite their amazing skills at hunting the
dead.
<br><br>
But in EQ we won’t have that luxury.  A computer will never be able to make decisions
like that in favor of the players in order to increase the life span of the story or
to just make the game more fun.  As soon as a computer does that, it should start
asking for it’s rights as a sentient creature.
<br><br>
And that’s why characters come back to life in these multi-player on-line games.
Sure, lag can kill you unfairly.  Sure, you could wander into something that is just
way over your head.  Sure, a nasty band of d00dz could off you.  But these are
solvable or tamable problems.  There’s a larger picture here.  That the game can’t
be fun if you don’t get to continue the tale.  But I would also add that the game
can’t be fun if there is no risk.  That’s why the GM doesn’t cheat for his players
all that often, and never in a glaring way.  And that’s why there should be a risk
of ruining a character if he dies too often in EQ.  A significant loss of stats or
levels or whatever should do it.  Don’t think that I am giving up on the idea of
permanent death in on on-line RPG.  I’ll just have to wait for the Internet to
mature, and for the Internet role playing society to grow.  THEN…
