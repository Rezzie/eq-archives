<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Q & A in issue 83 someone asked how to make a macro... My question is how do I memorize spells into the hotkey spots on the bottom left like those on the screenshot shown. I have asked people in game but they always say just click on the spell in the book and grad to the left. I want them on the bottom as well.. thanks for your help 
<br><br>

<br><br>
	 I understand how to set up Macros on the Social Keys but what about hot keys, specifically the user defined ones. I haven't been able to program these keys other than edit the stock ones (i.e. A for attack) provided by Verant. 
<br><br>
- Golodorn, level 10 fighter 
<br><br>
	 After reading your recent answer about how to create macros, it got me to wondering...
<br><br>
Trying to keep my skills honed, I often use a weapon with which I am less than optimally proficient. Occasionally, I get in such a dire straight that I wish to switch to my "preferred" weapon type (in this case 1H Slash).
<br><br>
Is there a way to create a hotkey that will change weapons?
<br><br>
Thanks and keep up the great work.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Macro Issue
<br><br>
Macros can be highly effective in making your character fight better, and especially work better in teams.  Here are some answers and tips.
<br><br>
To hotkey any button simply left click and hold the button until it releases and becomes your cursor.  Move it over to your hotkey pad and left click over the slot you want it to be in and it will drop off your cursor.  This works for spells, social commands, and inventory slots.
<br><br>
<b>Spells</b> - I use my hotkey pad for spells and organize them by purpose.  I have my "combat pad" which currently holds the spells I find myself as a cleric using most often in combat.  I also have a "Buff pad" which has all the buffs I cast during combat downtime.   Just right click and hold on the spell from the 8 spell slots after you have memorized it, and bring it down to a hotkey pad.  I also have on my combat pad the single most important grouping social button you can create - /assist.
<br><br>
<b>Social commands</b> - From your windowed screen, you will see buttons on the middle right which say "Combat" "Main" and "Socials".  Click on the socials and you will see a few rows of buttons that do some commonly used commands like AFK.  These buttons can be hot-keyed, and also can be edited to create your own socials.  You can put any /command in there and make a button of it.
<br><br>
To create a social macro, right-click on a social button that you wish to edit or change.  In the middle "text" box will appear a multi-line form with a heading on top.  Edit the heading to label the button so that you will be able to distinguish it from your other buttons, and label it, of course, with something you can remember.  For example, I label my /assist key "Assist".  Below the heading you can enter a multiple number of commands, one per line.  /say, /g, /assist, /who all friends, all are good candidates for macro buttons.  Each line is just that - one line. The text doesn't wrap.  Also Each line is short - keep it brief, and use more than one line do accomplish a long action.
<br><br>
Here are some of the more useful uses of the social macro:
<br><br>
<b>Pet commands</b> - I have a mage who has a complete bank of pet commands.  When I need to, I switch to the pet command bank and hit the appropriate key, such as the "PBO" key (/pet back off).  I have the "PA" key (/pet attack) on my combat bank of buttons.
<br><br>
<b>Assist</b> - /assist targets and attacks what your target is attacking. Sounds a bit confusing, but here is how I use it.  When grouped I usually pick out one person to be the attacker.  That person selects what the group is to kill by attacking it.  Once the fight starts, I target that person using the appropriate Fkey and then hit the assist button.  If the whole group does the same, we are all attacking the same creature.  Once that foe goes down, the targeting party member attacks another foe and we all switch to that one.
<br><br>
When not grouped and someone is running past me yelling for help, I try to click on the person and heal them.  However, sometimes I target their attacker by accident, so I just hit the assist key and now I am targeting the person attacked, i.e., the poor schmuck running past me. It's much quicker that running and trying to click on some guy fleeing for his life.  If that person then turns to fight and I pitch in to help, I can monitor the character's health bar by flicking back and forth between our mutual foe and the foe's target - the character.
<br><br>
<b>Multi-line social commands</b> -Here is one of my favorites:<br>
/say My God, what does a dwarf have to do to get some peace and quiet around here?<br>
/em grumbles.<br>
/em hunkers down to contemplate the ways of Brell
<br><br>
This is my meditate in the Crushbone throne room button J.  You can make multi-line social by merely adding commands to each line.  Creative players make the combination of emotes, says, and commands fun.  My /assist hotkey has a /say I will help you, my friend!
<br><br>
A friend of mine has a complicated sword drawing and attacking emote which is pretty cool.
<br><br>
<b>Combat commands</b> - for leaders and those of you that group often, common group messages such as "Out of mana", "ZONE", "RUN", and "Heal please" are great hotkeys.
<br><br>
<b>Inventory slots</b> - Inventory slots can be right click, hold, and dragged just like any button.  This is the simplest method to switch weapons - you just must make sure that you keep that slot open all the time for the switch.  Make that inventory slot a hotkey, and hotkey your held weapon also.  It's a more complicated dance for two-handed vs. one-handed switches, I haven't puzzled it out yet, but I know it can be done.  Another thing handy is the use of a inventory slot for potions.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you have a spell cast on you like SOW, and you recast it after 20 mins or so. Does the spell start all over again, or just add to the existing time.
<br><br>
Thanks,
<br><br>
- Deoful 
<br><br>
The spell starts all over again.  I call it "refreshing" the spell, and when I'm in a group I will do it before the buff drops when I am flush with mana and waiting for other casters to rest, so I don't find myself having to buff when I am low on mana.
<br><br>
In all the screenshots out there, everybody looks pretty much the same.  I was looking forward to having my character dress up in flashy clothes act in a general swashbuckly way.  Will I need to quest for armor and accessorize to get just the right look, or are there cheaper solutions, such as buying items of clothing? 
<br><br>

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in time, you will have to quest and get just the right armor and clothing to flesh out your swashbuckly look.  You will also be faced with the disappointing fact that a cloak does not show up, thus robbing your character of a staple item of swashbuckler fashion.
