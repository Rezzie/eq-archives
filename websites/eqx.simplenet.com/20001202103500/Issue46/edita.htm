Last week's game was a shocker, at least to some of our players.  I guess you'll need some background to understand what happened.  This campaign involves characters pulled from many disparate planes of existence.  We were selected more for our potential than anything else.  We were hired to work for a very powerful inter-planar merchant.  He sent us to a realm of you more standard fantasy type, with all the things you expect out of a D&D world.  And we began doing odd jobs for his employees.
<br><br>
We are so far down the chain of command in this organization that everyone was very pleased when we were able to hire a maid.  Now there was someone that <b>we</b> could give orders to.
<br><br>
So, after getting to know each other a bit, we took on a few tasks of our own making.  We rescued a few minor merchants from a gang of slaves.  <em>This was nearly a fiasco.  Our GM had called it the confidence building game, too...</em>  This made us fairly popular.  In fact, based on this fame, we were asked by one of the local council women to make contact with a friend of hers that she had not heard from in a while.  This friend was a druid, and we ended up rescuing him from a witch.  Once again, just barely.  Our successes, marginal as they were, pleased our boss.  Not only were we showing initiative, but we were making a name for ourselves.
<br><br>
So he asked us to deliver a message to a wizard that had worked for him a while ago.  We were to tell him that his services would be needed again.  A simple task.  I think we all knew that it sounded too simple.  But we packed our bags and did as told.  The trip was easy.  Very easy.  You know, the kind of easy that we often refer to as <em>too easy</em>.  As we neared the wizards mound, we noted that all was not right.  Uh huh, he lives in a mound.  Reasonably well hidden, with nice skylights, ample space...  I nice place.  My character was ready to move in.  Especially since the owner was missing.  But there would have been lots of repairs.  The front door was smashed; there were a few large, goopy constructs mucking about; dust; rats; all the usual abandoned lair stuff.  But it was still a nice place.
<br><br>
Nice but for that one room.  In the center was a circle, some of us recognized it as a protective circle.  It was the kind that might be used to keep a summoned creature at bay.  So we stepped in, careful to avoid the golden scribings on the floor.  But a few seconds after we stepped in the dust on the floor began to stir in an unearthly breeze.  Within seconds enough of it had risen to show us what the dust had previously obscured.  The entire room was covered in the patterns of protection.  Too late we realized that we were trapped in some sort of...
<br><br>
Poof.  The dust cleared.  We found ourselves standing on a rock, one of the few smooth ones on this blighted plane.  And in front of us was a small winged creature, with tough blood-red skin.  In its hands it held a small but very pointy looking pitchfork.  The creature seemed actually more frightened of us then we were of it.  So I bullied it into telling us a bit about our situation.  We also forced it to lead us to the witch that might know how to get out of...
<br><br>
Hell.  My character knew it immediately for what it was.  He was from a world like ours, and the wings and the pitchfork were too much of a hint.
<br><br>
Yup, first level characters in Hell.  That was the shocker.  Not to me, I've been a victim of the GM from Hell for too long.  You may be thinking that this is a bit too much.  And, I suppose it is.  But this is not going to be the kind of game where we fight our way out.  If we actually fight anything we're dead.  But if we are calm and rational we will get out.  It's a learning experience for the characters.  A character builder, so to speak.
<br><br>
We haven't finished this little game yet.  We'll be playing it on Halloween, a fairly thematic scenario.  And right now I can't think of anyway to link it to EverQuest, so I won't try.
<br><br>
Oh, and if you want to watch a great Halloween movie, go rent Cemetery Man.  I don't know if you'll find it in your local video store, but if you do I think you'll enjoy it, especially if you liked Evil Dead.
