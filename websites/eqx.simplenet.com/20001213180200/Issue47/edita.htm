<br>
First let me ease your worries.  We got out of Hell.  I know that was your biggest concern of the week.  Glad I could make you more comfortable.
<br><br>
After stepping into a trapped gate leading straight to Hell, our group of first level characters found themselves faced with the smallest devil we will probably ever see.  This little beastie had been set there to be on watch for an invasion of Hell through the portal.  He never really expected it to happen.  But he feared that we must be dangerous folks.  Who but the most powerful would dare invade this realm?  I jumped into bard mode (despite playing a Magic User) and grasped onto that little bit of fear.  I ordered the devil kin to do our bidding and to lead us to an exit.  Reluctantly it complied.  It led us to a witch.
<br><br>
Our path required that we sneak our way across some of the most hideous landscape ever.  The ground was covered in sharp rocks, painful to walk on.  Painful for us, and painful for the rocks.  Within each rock was a trapped soul.  All around us were exploding fireballs thrown out by lava geysers.  All around us were screams.  And then there was the river...  I river of blood that contained the souls of the damned.  We were lucky, one of our characters is a pixie and could change into a large eagle and fly us across.  All of us but the half-giant.  He had to walk.  The only thing that was good about the trip was that he did not fall in, face first.  There was a bit of agony for his when he reached the other side and had to wring the blood and souls from his clothing...
<br><br>
We eventually found the witch.  Her reaction to us was a bit extreme, but understandable.  She tangled us in a web, accusing us of being devils ourselves.  Our thief was out of the spells affect and was able to convince her that we were not native to the place.  She decided to free us by throwing a bolt of searing lightning at our guide, killing him and igniting the webs.  My poor mage, already weakened by the trip, was knocked out by the fire.  Luckily we had one more potion of healing.  I was able to limp around after that with some help.
<br><br>
Our party convinced her to help us.  She told us that the Pillar of Skulls (I think that's what it was called) could tell us the way out.  I desperately wanted her to come with us, as she had helped us and certainly did not belong trapped in Hell.  But she refused, apparently too fearful of leaving her haven.  My character left with a heavy heart.
<br><br>
Again we had to cross the river.  But this time our pixie, Wyland, was too weak to fly at all, much less carry anyone.  The air was hurting our lungs, and the heat was devastating our bodies.  We had been out of water for hours.  So all of us had to brave the terrible river.  All but Wyland who was carried by our giant friend.  Once on the other side I decided to try to rescue one of these poor souls.  There was some discussion about the value of that.  The rest of the group thought that even if I did succeed at rescuing one, it would be an evil soul, one that is supposed to be here.  But Ryan (my character) told them that these could easily be here wrongly, just as we were.  So he stubbornly dipped a strip of cloth into the river, catching a soul.  He stuffed the rag into his now very empty water skin.  If he couldn't save the witch, he would try to save someone.
<br><br>
We arrived at the pillar exhausted.  We could hear the bickering even before we could see its source.  But when we did we were shocked.  A pillar made entirely of heads, heads of all types.  As you could imagine, getting the information we needed was not easy.  After several minutes of yelling at the pillar, an Ogre head yelled, forcing all the others to silence.  The Ogre said it would answer any five questions if we would just push one of our members into the pillar.  Nobody wanted to do that.  Many other heads had offers for us.
<br><br>
"Bring me a devil spine!"
<br><br>
"Pry off the Ogre head."
<br><br>
"Sweet Grass!  Bring me sweet grass!"
<br><br>
But Ryan, still the psychotic ex-superhero, decided that the Ogre would have the best information, and that if anyone was going into the pillar, it would be him.  So he tied a rope around his waist and backed into the pillar...
<br><br>
Now here is where I diverted my character's actions to meet the needs of the player.  I knew that the Ogre head was asking for a sacrifice, nothing less.  I think Ryan would have known it too.  The Devil never let's you off easy.  In fact, during the entire trip to the pillar I had been deciding what Ryan would give up to save the group.  The witch had warned us that they would demand a price.  And Ryan would pay it.  I was thinking that they would be fleshless skulls and that Ryan would gladly give them an eye to rescue his new friends.  And that was something that I as a player could live with.  But I was not really willing to sacrifice the entire character.  Ryan probably would have given his life, and he would not have tied on the rope.  But I was not ready to start a new character.  Sometimes you just have to sacrifice a bit of the character's personality to make the player happy.
<br><br>
So Ryan backed into the pillar.  Immediately he starts to scream.  Dozens of mouths are ripping at his flesh.  He's being eaten alive.  The half-giant pulls Ryan out.  I think that our GM was again being nice.  The heads certainly would have bitten the rope first.  But I'm not complaining.
<br><br>
Ryan was, of course, unconscious.  He was that way for the rest of the game.  The Ogre started calling us liars.  Our group called him a liar.  We had pushed one of us into the pillar.  It should tell us the answers we want.  The Ogre told the pillar that none of them would speak to us again.  And there was silence.
<br><br>
So they pried the Ogre from the pillar.  They enjoyed that part.  :P  Then the Elf that had insisted that we do that told them where the gate was, and that the key to opening it was a brick from the great road.  Only two of our group were in any real shape to travel.  So they went off to the road, leaving the wounded and just plain out cold behind.  They, of course, had to cross the river again.  This time they were attacked by a large ray shaped beast with a lamprey shaped head.  It knocked out the hunter, leaving the half-giant on his own.  The poor guy is not too bright, and he had to carry the hunter the rest of the way.  But he managed to avoid the many flying beasts and reach the road.
<br><br>
The road was a busy thoroughfare.  Our giantish friend waited, and waited, and waited for a chance to run out from cover and dig up a brick from it.  He got his chance when the whole of the host of Hell began to march.  To where we do not know.  We felt some sorrow for those that they were off to attack, but we would not pass up the opportunity.  So the giant gathered a brick and came back to the pillar, again crossing the river...  Poor guy.
<br><br>
All this time I'm holding my tongue.  My only thought was that we might EACH need a brick to pass the portal...
<br><br>
The group gathered it's wounded and started off to the gate, hoping beyond hope that the head of an Elven sage who was condemned to Hell for cheating his customers was telling us the truth.  For each of us that was walking there was one that could not.  Some of us had swallowed potions, not for their magical value, but because they were liquid.  We were a sad looking bunch.  Even sadder when we noticed that there were several flying demons scouting the area.  When they saw us it was a race to the gate.  We arrived just before them.  But they only circled over head, looking too much like vultures.  Very big vultures.
<br><br>
But they were not coming down.  And that meant that there was a reason, something that even they feared.  As we approached the gate there was a large blue creature waiting for us.  It told us that it would let us pass only if we were to take with us a small cube.  One of us started to question the creature, wondering exactly what it would do.  The blue creature created a pillar of fire on top of the poor fellow.  He, and the party member he was carrying, collapsed.  The remaining members of the group agreed immediately to take the cube with us.  We dragged, limped and fell through the gate, all holding hands or some other body part.
<br><br>
Luckily one brick worked to carry all of us through the gate.
<br><br>
We found ourselves on Sigil.  I'll not explain Sigil.  If you know of it, great.  It's the key city in the planescape world created by TSR.  We managed to bribe someone to show us to our employer's home, and lived long enough to get there.
<br><br>
And I did not have to create a new character.  I can now use this as a turning point in Ryan's life.  He was one who could easily give his life for another, or try to.  But when he was a superhero he was nearly invulnerable.  Now he is a mere mortal.  A powerful mage for his level of training, but not the kind of person that can take a bullet, or a crossbow bolt.  He now knows that he will have to be cautious.  He can still do good for people, but he has to do it with his mind and not his body.  I think he's got a much better chance of living a while now.  But I'm going to think up a second character anyway...
