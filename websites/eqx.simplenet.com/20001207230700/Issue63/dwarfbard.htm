   In the mountains of Butcherblock, a cool breeze arose, and blew north across the land.  It ruffled the long grass, rustled among the leaves of the trees, tangled the beards of the dour guards that manned the lonely wayposts.  It passed over the hills and rocky outcroppings, carrying the scent of coal and metal working from the forges, and dipped into valleys to pick up the scent of the wild flowers and the tang of the fiery breath of drakes.  The breeze blew north, and swirled into the pass to Greater Faydark, where a lone Wood Elf stood, gazing across the distance toward Kaladim, mighty home of the Dwarven race.
<br><br>
   Elnore Dal'lithe shivered slightly at the caress of the crisp mountain air.  Her face was brown and smooth, although age had begun to draw fine lines at the corners of her eyes.  Her slight form was slung about with pouches and packs, and the state of her leather armor bespoke a long and difficult journey.  Two axes hung at her belt, keeping strange company with the lute case, hand drum and flute that proclaimed her calling to the world.  Elnore was a bard, and at the moment, she was a troubled troubadour indeed.
<br><br>
   She had received a message from an old friend, a Dwarven Cleric by the name of Thagor Bakosh, asking her to come without delay to Kaladim.  He was calling in an old favor, from the days of their adventuring together in the forests of Greater Faydark, fighting the endless battle with the orcs of Crushbone.  He had saved her life, and more, he had saved her daughter, Kien, from a nameless and weary death in the mines of the Crushbone lair.  She had pledged her aid to him, should he ever call.  He had brushed it aside at the time, smiled and said that he had done as all people of good heart should, and they had never spoken of it again.  Yet now, almost twenty years later, after she had ended her adventurer's wanderings, and settled into a training position at the Songweaver's Guildhouse, he called upon her to fulfill her vow, and come to him as soon as possible.  She had taken up her axes, packed her bags and left.  Now she stood, worried and wondering what had happened.  The letter had not been urgent, exactly, but filled nevertheless with a sense of uneasy supplication, as though Thagor had not wanted to write it at all, yet had been driven to.
<br><br>
   Setting aside her gloomy thoughts, she lifted her hand drum and beat on it gently, calling forth the ancient magic of the bardic gift.  With the rhythm pulsing in her blood and quickening her feet, she ran fleetly down and onto the path that lead to the ancestral home of the Dwarves.  
<br><br>
   She spotted goblins on either side of the path, lurking in the trees, scuttling from the rocks and hillsides to glare balefully at her as she sped past.  She was unconcerned about her own safety, as she had long ago passed the point in her skills where a few goblins could harm her, but their numbers and the boldness with which they approached the path were reasons for worry.  How had the Dwarves let their guard down and allowed them to increase in numbers so?  In her day, the goblins had been wary and fearful, taught by the vigilance of the Dwarven guards that the Butcherblocks were Dwarven territory, and no encroachment was allowed.  Elnore ran on, her thoughts thrumming in time to the beat of her magic.
<br><br>
   With her speed augmented by the music, she covered the distance from the pass to the second waypost in a third of the time it would take any other person.  Night was just falling as she reached the low stone building, and the glow of its lights was welcome indeed.  She claimed traveler's right from the silent glowering guards, and they grudgingly gave her a bed for the night.  By tomorrow night, if she ran through dusk and did not stop for food or rest, she could be at the gates of Kaladim.  She fell into an uneasy slumber.
<br><br>
  She was awakened during the night by a screeching and howling outside the walls of the post, and started up from her blankets with a gasp.  The noise was broken by the war cries of the guards, and she understood immediately.  The goblins had attacked the post.  She flung back the covers and reached for her flute, but even as she grasped it, the noise of combat ceased.  She went to the door and opened it.  At the end of the hall, a guard rose from his post and then sat back down when he saw who it was.
<br><br>
   "Have no fear," he said gruffly.  "We have dealt with the threat."
<br><br>
   "But, goblins attacking a waypost?  When did they become so brave?"  she asked.  She clutched her flute in one hand like a lifeline, a connection to safety and sanity.
<br><br>
   "These are troubled times..." the Dwarf trailed off in the face of her disbelief.  "The Dwarves are not what we were."  His shame was writ clearly on his face, and she withdrew into her room, unwilling to witness his pain.
<br><br>
   The morning sun rose early, and Elnore rose with it.  She ran off down the path, drum in hand, more eager than ever to reach Kaladim and see Thagor.  Things were not right, not right at all.
<br><br>
   It was, as she predicted, nightfall by the time the massive entrance to Kaladim came in sight.  The huge statue of the stern Dwarven warrior above the gates was just as she remembered it, its impassive countenance dominating the hills and mountains around the Dwarven home.  The guards at the gates eyed her askance, but let her through without question.  Things in the city were much as she remembered them, as well, save for the people. 
<br><br>
    She remembered the Dwarves as a dour people, yet capable of merriment and even joy.  These looked as though their lives were devoid of any trace of lighter emotion.  They walked by her without bounce to their step or light in their eyes.  They looked defeated and despairing.  Elnore wondered to herself, and quickened her steps to Thagor's home.
<br><br>
   Reaching his low stone door at last, she paused, took a deep breath, and lifted her hand to knock.  Just as her fingers grasped the ornate knocker, the door opened, and Thagor popped out like an enchanter's magic trick.  He gaped at her in astonishment, and, unable to halt his forward motion, collided violently with her.  The two of them went sprawling in the street.
<br><br>
   "My friend!"  He sprang to his feet and lifted her to hers with one hand.  She always forgot the surprising strength of the Dwarves.  "Are you hurt?  Did I damage an instrument?  Physical damage to you, I know I can be forgiven, but if I have snapped a string on your lute, I am sure that I have forfeited our friendship."  He wore a whimsical yet solicitous grin, and Elnore's heart was glad to see that he, at least, had not forgotten how to smile.
<br><br>
  "I am fine, Thagor.  And you know as well as I that my instruments are protected well against the perils of travel, and the clumsiness of Dwarves."  She gave the hard leather cases a smack.  
<br><br>
   "In that case, come in and be welcome again in my home.  I was just on my way out to see if any news had come from you.  I did not expect your presence on my doorstep!"  His words were light, but beneath them, Elnore could hear again the uneasiness.  She held her tongue, and let herself be ushered into his home.
<br><br>
   It was the same as she remembered, with thick woven carpets, and dark wooden paneling on the walls.  The furniture was heavy and dark as well, in the Dwarven style, and yet the total effect was not stern, but cozy and warm.  A fire burned cheerily in the fireplace, and he bustled about, taking her cloak and packs, getting her mulled wine to take the chill of the journey from her and urging her to the most comfortable chair.  Her belongings deposited in the guestroom, and her feet up on a footstool before the fire, she sipped at her hot drink and eyed her friend quizzically.  His duties as a host fulfilled, he lost his purpose and his good spirits.  He clutched as his own cup with both hands, not drinking, and avoided her eyes.
<br><br>
   "Thagor." She set aside her cup and leaned forward.  "Why did you write me that letter?  After all this time, what is so important that you call upon me now to discharge my debt to you?  Not that I mind, of course, but you worry me.  Something is obviously wrong."
<br><br>
   "It is a… personal matter, Elnore, and one that causes me some embarrassment I fear," he answered, staring at the fire.  "I must ask you to do something that will cause you embarrassment as well, and like as not the whole thing will end badly, but I have no choice.  He is my nephew, and I promised his mother that he would have every chance I could give him to lead the life he chose.  That he has chosen as he has causes me grief, as it affects not only me but you as well, my friend."  He lifted his gaze to hers.  "All I ask is that you allow him to try.  You have influence with your guild, you can give him a chance to prove himself.  I do not ask for miracles, Elnore.  Only a chance."
<br><br>
   "My old friend."  She took his hands in hers.  "Calm yourself.  I do not understand what it is that you ask of me.  Give him a chance?  A chance to do what?"
<br><br>
   "My nephew wishes to become a bard," he said simply.   She stared at him for a moment, flabbergasted, and then began to laugh.  Her laughter pealed out and reverberated around the rafters, and tears formed at the corners of her eyes.
<br><br>
   "A… a Dwarven bard?" she managed finally.  "Oh, Thagor, you have become a jester in your old age."  She poked him playfully in the side.  "Tell me, what did you truly call me for?  A fine joke, but not worthy of the arduous trip I made here."
<br><br>
   He did not respond to her mirth.  His face was serious, almost grim, as he shook his head.
<br><br>
   "I do not jest, Elnore.  The lad is a fool, but I cannot change his mind.  I have given up.  Let him try, and let him see what a mockery he makes of his father's name.  All I ask of you is that he be allowed to come before the Guild master, and audition.  Without doubt he will fail, and you can send him home again.  I am keeping a place for him in the family forge.  I only hope this ridiculousness does not haunt him for the rest of his life.  Dwarves are not tolerant of difference, or those who mock tradition."
<br><br>
   Elnore slowly sat back in her seat.  The Dwarf was serious.  A Dwarven bard?  Her mind boggled.  She could just see the face of her Guild master when she presented this hopeful youngster to him.  Yet she had no choice.  Her word bound her as surely as chains.  She slowly shook her head in resignation.  
<br><br>
   "I will do as you ask, Thagor, but I warn you, it will bring him nothing but pain and ridicule."  She laughed again, with a tinge of bitterness.  "And I will no doubt bear the jests of my colleagues for many a day.  "Still," and she perked up slightly.  "It will make a fine tale.  No names mentioned, of course," she added hastily at Thagor's glare.  His glower faded.
<br><br>
   "I thank you, Elnore," he said awkwardly.  "You are a good friend, and true."
<br><br>
   "It is my honor to serve you, Thagor," she said gently, and meant it.  "Well, when do I meet this extraordinary young man?"
<br><br>
   "I have invited him to dinner tomorrow.  I did not ask you this of my own free will.  I told him the stories of our adventures one too many times, it seems, and he remembered your vow to me when I had forgotten it.  Forgive him his impetuous nature.  He means no ill, truly, but he has a will like iron, and I, in my dotage, have become soft and easily swayed."
<br><br>
   "No harm done, my friend, and I bear no ill will.  The vow was made truly and I welcome the chance to honor it."  She smiled warmly at her old friend, and he returned it with relief.
<br><br>
   They stayed up until the wee hours of the morning, drinking wine and reliving old days.  Thagor's capacity for drink had not diminished in the years that she had not seen him. When Elnore finally went tipsily to her bed, the idea of a Dwarven bard seemed… almost feasible.
