<b>Part Seventeen</b>


<br><br>

   The Temple of Marr was a huge and impressive building of white marble, situated in the most expensive district of Freeport.  The Paladins patrolled the streets here, at the request of the citizens.  The Militia rarely entered the area, and when they did, they came in large groups and did not stay long.  Armed conflict had been avoided so far, but the tension was palpable whenever Paladins and Militia came face to face.

There's so much to work with.  I asked the denizens of the Avault newsgroup Forum.Everquest to give me some names that were in the game that were not very true to the environment.  What I got was a list of over thirty before I stopped taking notes.

<br><br>
	Neren found the art of magic very interesting.  Casting spells became more of a hobby than a necessity.  He reached the rank of four with Duror.  Gilerrin managed to buy a Minotaur Axe and reach fifth rank.  Neren noticed that reaching higher ranks took many more kills than the previous rank to complete.  He also noticed that others kept saying "experience."  Experience, it appeared, was needed to level, or reach a new rank.  Each kill, depending on how hard it was gave experience.

	The events of the last four days have made me glad to have generous and compassionate friends.  My tale begins four days ago.  I had recently made the dangerous journey to North Karana and purchased myself a fine new combine scimitar from the gypsies.  This well-crafted and powerful weapon is a great improvement over my minotaur axe, as it allows me to injure previously invulnerable opponents.

Well, week after week I get the chance to come in here and tell you all what I think about something.  Often it's something not very strongly tied to EverQuest.  After all, we've been doing this for nearly two years.  EverQuest is a great game, but seriously, how much stuff am I supposed to be able to talk about relating to just one game?

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello all I have question for you. I am a Bard and would like to know why I am auto-targeted when grouped as some party members find this a little annoying. Also I was wondering why Bards can't use bow's and Paladins can<b>...</b>
<br>Thank you Koldar

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I and my friends want to play on the same server, but we have chars on different servers right now. I heard there would be some sort of quest so you could change the server and take your char and bank inventory with you?
