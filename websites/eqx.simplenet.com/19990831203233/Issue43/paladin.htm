Damp, salty circles formed on the cracked earth. A short cry was heard, causing twenty birds to flap away from their rest on a scorched tree. An ant paused, sensing the drops tiny vibrations, and scurried of north; leaving it's invisible enemy behind.... Colour was then added, bringing a red hue to the wet circles, giving them the unknown feeling of their creator. The red dripped from another source, it was the cause of sorrow and the taint of internal damnation. The clear, but poisoned drops were the reflection of sorrow and regret; come too late to hold any salvation. What was done was done, the needless waste had passed; only the scar on nature told the story. 
<br><br>
<center><em>It is strange... the essence of man. He enters a war as a baby enters the world, unknowing of the horrors they both hold. He fights blindly for his beliefs, only to be unsure of what they are. His passion rules his reason, but societies' influence changes his passion. 
If a child had the physical strength, he would smash anything that would displease him; such is the history of man. We try to find the answer to this endless question, looking to an enternal figure for comfort and reassurance. All our lives we try to understand, and the question is, why?</em></center>

Again, a cry was heard, softer and more soulful than the first. How many lives where lost? A hundered? A thousand? He did not know. He gazed at his pattern on the dusty ground. The circles had splattered and joined together from the constant heavenly assault, resembling a smudged mess that reflected his insides. The red had stained the earth, having the illusion of healthy, iron rich dirt; a stark contrast to the grey surroundings. The field had been cleared not long ago, but smoke and small flames struggling for life still rose from the barren landscape. The crows returned, seeking food, adding the perfect touch of misery. It seemed as though his soul was struggling to free itself, needing to be away from the madness of its container. Of course, only one thing could free it, taunted his sword, pulling his eyes to the gleaming surface.
<br><br>
<em><center>Not long ago, this man had family, friends and a future. But also, not long ago, this same man sped through the battlefield, eyes wide with horror, killing friend and foe alike.
You see, training for war is not in the arm or chest, but in the soul. Only mental preparation will save you from the untold horrors. Paladins face a death far worse than that of steel or iron, but an inner death; the death of the soul. The lethal mixture of bloodlust and sorrow can break even the strongest of men; their blank hollow eyes tell the unfathomable.</em></center>

And so it was over, another decade or so would pass, maybe more, and it will happen again. This man was sworn to help the needy; care for the sick. This man gave his life from birth to the god's of good and kindness. This man fell to the greed of battle, and to the looting of the dead. This man pointed his sword to his heart and fell, a smile of joy touching his lips for the first time. As tears of joy coursed down his face, his soul, at last free, drifted over the fields, past dead soldiers; through playgrounds of laughing children; through the hearts of crying women, and old men. This is a Paladins fate, and only self-awareness can save him from it.
