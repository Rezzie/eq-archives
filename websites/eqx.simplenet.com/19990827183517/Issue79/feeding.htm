Gurgle has been getting many comments and questions from envious Ogres and irate blue-elves about her adorable little blue-elf pet Cynarra. Gurgle not so much concerned about the blue-elves who rant and rave about not taking them seriously.  However, Gurgle has realized that the many justifiably envious Ogres who see Gurgle with such a cute pet may rush out and get a blue-elf pet for themselves without considering the very serious responsibilities that come with blue-elf ownership!
<br><br>
Gurgle chat today with another blue-elf owner named Ethlinn, who recently got herself a very docile and obedient blue-elf warrior pet named Sabriam, and discussed some important tips for taking care of your blue-elf so it lives a long, happy life!
<br><br>
<b>1. Choosing your blue-elf pet</b>
<br><br>
Not every blue-elf makes a good pet! Go shopping in Neriak; there are lots of them running around, happily bonking skeletons and spiders. At a glance, they all look adorable, but try to pet or pick one up and they will probably bite and scratch, or possibly incinerate you if they're really moody.
<br><br>
Gurgle think that girl-elfs make better pets, and have prettier hair, but most important is little-blue elf's favorite Diety. If little blue-elf worship Innoruuk, they usually are brooding and mopey, will languish about the house and just lie in the moonbeams all night long while dreaming about you suffering in eternal torment and pain.
<br><br>
So get a blue-elf who worship sumbuddy else. Rallos-Zek warrior-elfs are very fiesty and like to play-fight (tho they might accidentally disembowel you once in a while), Solusek Ro Wizard Elfs (like Gurgle's own little Cynarra!) are very smart and can be trained to do tricks, like speak in wierd languages and fetch monsters with their spells. So choose well!
<br><br>
<b>2. Proper Feeding</b>
<br><br>
This one confyoozes lots of Ogres. Blue-elfs are itty-bitty little darlings! So Ogre think "Hm, elf-pet weigh 10 times less than Ogre, must -eat- 10 times less than ogre!" This is very bad way to think!! It funny, but little elfs eat just as much as us Ogres! It's because they're so frisky and hyperactive, running around frum place to place on their little blue legs and barking about death and armageddon at every stranger who happens by when they are healthy and happy.
<br><br>
So, very important to keep blue-elf well fed to keep their energy up.
<br><br>
<b>3. Grooming</b>
<br><br>
Little blue-elfs have very fine, pretty silver hair that gets tangled very easily. It very important to brush out hair gently and carefully, giving them a nice full mane. Be carefully to use gentle touch... if you pull too hard on tangle, blue elf might start yelping rilly loud, start struggling, or possibly harm touch you 121 points of non-melee damage.
<br><br>
Blue elfs have smooth blue skin, but Gurgle not know anything about proper body-lotions for blue elfs to keep them shiny. Girl-blue-elfs, since all their armor is made by Fredericks of Neriak, have their skin especially exposed to the elements all the time, but Gurgle would prolly accidentally bruise up Cynarra pretty bad with big ogre hands if tried to use lotion. So, give pet steady diet of Black Bread to give their skin a nice dark, royal-blue luster.
<br><br>
<b>4. Discipline</b>
<br><br>
Blue-elfs can be excellent companions and playmates. Even so, they are sometimes naughty, and it is important for you to be an understanding but firm disciplinarian when they are. Be sensitive to your blue-elf's needs, and mindful of how they act. Correct them with a stern, incapacitating fist on the noggin when they eat out of your backpack, sharpen their rusty weapons on your nice rock furniture, or try to carve your still-beating heart from your chest in sacrifice to the God of Hatred while you are sleeping. Be sure to catch them in the act, too, or they'll never learn.
<br><br>
Follow these pets and you should be well on your way to a loving relationship with your zany, adorable, and undeniably malevolent blue-elf pet!
