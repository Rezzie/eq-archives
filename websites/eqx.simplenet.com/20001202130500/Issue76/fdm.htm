Much to my surprise, Oghma recently asked me to pen a timeline of events for how the F'leurs DuMal changed their leadership during the tumult of the transition from Beta to Final. I remember the times well, for during the final days of Phase 4, I was inducted as T'aedaryn, Dark Elf Cleric of Innoruuk, but I regretfully never got to adventure with any other FDM. During the transition, Oghma's free time dwindled and he became embroiled with the adventures of Oghma, the Dwarf Cleric, and Kakur, a fellow guildmate of ours in the StormWolves. It was not to be, though, that the FDM's evil head would remain bowed, lurking in wait, for long. 
<br><br>
FDM members, all suffering from similarly overladen schedules as Oghma, wondered what was to occur with the guild, and Oghma's character of T'daven seemed nowhere to be found. It became apparent that new leadership would perhaps be needed for the FDM. But who to step forward? Not I, surely, as but a junior member. Perhaps Beldro, the rampaging Necromancer? Sinen, the well-traveled and prideful ShadowKnight?  Ezmend the Enchanter?  Gainam the farseeing?  Suggestions were made and ideas passed, until Danubus sounded the clarion call for the resurgence of FDM's evil in Norrath by re-creating Sinen. He asked for us to begin the formal email process of submission to Verant, and things were underway, albeit slowly at first.
<br><br>
I decided to do my part by re-creating T'aedaryn, a Cleric of Innoruuk who was born to a well-off family and knew the pains of hard labor only during his apprenticeship as one of Innoruuk's Chosen priests.  He grew up in the shadow of his father, a Cleric who had fallen in battle while healing his fellow Teir'Dal; he both admired and hated his father, both for his ability to save his comrades and his inability to save himself.   In T'aedaryn's early days, he was raised with a brother, Xerix, but both were separated to continue pursuit of their aptitudes.  The Lodge of the Dead, the purist vein of Teir'Dal consisting of the ShadowKnights, Clerics, and Necromancers, had their grasp on both our souls, but Xerix was born to walk a different path than my own as a Necromancer. 
<br><br>
During T'aedaryn's youthful apprenticeship, his proud heart and wandering eye caught Zadrenya, a promising and powerful young ShadowKnight of Innoruuk.  Her devotion to the ideals of the true Teir'Dal, her passionate hatred, her seemingly constant proud sneer, and seductively potent body captured Tae's attentions.  The two would often meet to "pray and meditate" upon Innoruuk's teachings when a spare moment presented itself, as away from their master's eyes as possible, often splashing each other in the moat water around the Temple or drinking each other under the table when leisure reigned.
<br><br>
When Tdaven first approached T'aedaryn regarding membership in the controversial F'leurs DuMal, he was slightly taken aback.  For a brief moment, the memory of his father falling in combat and the notion of joining a militant coven gave him chills.  But he would not let himself fall.  He would prove his worthiness to his people and to Innoruuk.  Thus, recruited before his apprenticeship was complete, T'aedaryn's pride soon flowed to Zadrenya, who expressed curiosity at the group.  Her skills and prowess were an obvious asset, and the fact that she and T'aedaryn were rarely separated made her a wise choice for membership.  However, the tumultuous End of the World, and the subsequent Recreation (the end of Phase 4 and the start of Final), threw these plans into chaos.  Tdaven was apparently unable to rouse himself from the mad poetic visions brought on by the changes in the universe, and succumbed to an endless stream of drink.  Zadrenya and T'aedaryn explored their new world together, slowly and carefully at first, like newborn children.
<br><br>
Soon several reborn members of the F'leurs DuMal surfaced.  Vamen, a promising and delightedly destructive young Wizard, and Valanye, a proudly spiteful female Wizard, joined us in our quests, harvesting Fire Beetle eyes for the Necromantic experimentations of the Lodge of the Dead.  Although these two Wizards were members of the Spurned, derided by the purist element of the Lodge of the Dead, they were our fellow guildmates and, more importantly, fellow Teir'Dal, strong in their stance against the enemies of our people and loyal in combat.  In our conversations I soon began to ponder the spite voiced by Valanye against Tdaven, and I began to wonder (to myself only) if she were perhaps one of the many women Tdaven had loved and dropped, like so many empty bottles and goblets. 
<br><br>
Recently, we were privileged to meet with our new leader, Sinen, who tested our skills and combat effectiveness.  Although he could easily outmatch any of us without further training, he smiled as he informed Zadrenya that the two of them would have to duel, "soon."  Although I understood the need for practice, I knew our energies were better spent at the moment in the destruction of the enemies of the Teir'Dal.  We even had reunion with Xerix, my rarely seen brother, who agreed to hunt with Sinen in the near future.  
<br><br>
After the others retired for the evening, Xerix and I began to talk and he expressed interest in fashion.  Unlike me, able to accentuate my native Teir'Dal charms with varied articles of patchwork armor or whatever else I could get my hands on, Xerix was made to walk the road of the Necromancer, and his tired grey robes preyed upon his senses.  Surely one who had progressed thus far as a potent Necromancer should be able to craft a more memorable and inspiring image.  We talked of Freeport, and the underground movement of the followers of Innoruuk in that city, some of which were actually Teir'Dal.  Eager to prove my prowess by striding into a city of humans and taking what I wanted, I informed Xerix of the secret passages under Freeport of which I knew and asked if I could guide him there.  Thus, we pierced into the heart of Freeport, finding the one sect of humans that had enough sense among them to worship Innoruuk, and although they were happy to see me, their fetid breath and oily smells made my skin crawl.  As soon as Xerix was finished, I was happy to Gate back home with him, not having to walk back through the tunnels clumsily carved by human hands.  We shared a short beer and laughed at that excursion, reveling in victory.

A brief transcript of the rebirth of the F'leurs DuMal, as captured in correspondences:
 <br><br>
<font face="courier" size="-1">From: "Tdaven/Oghma"<br>
Date: Wednesday, March 31, 1999 7:10 PM<br>
Subject: FDM Update
<br><br>
Sauntering in to the Blind Fish from another night's excursion, you go into the back room by the dartboards, where your F'leur DuMal compatriots can often be found. Last month your group played darts with a live halfling, which was great fun, but oddly, no one has been around lately.
<br><br>
Slumped over a table, you see your leader, Tdaven. It looks like his typical alcoholic stupor, perhaps laced with a hint of the hallucinogenic mushroom brandy, but as his face comes into view, you realize that you have never seen him so tormented.
<br><br>
"Dwarves! I'm being haunted by Dwarves!" Specks of froth line the corner of his lips, and his eyes have the dull sheen of one who hasn't slept in days. "I keep dreaming of two dwarves, running around Faydwer, slaying orcs and goblins and the undead at some 'chessboard'! I'm going mad!"
<br><br>
T'daven looks around crazily, and lunges for the near empty bottle on the floor by the table. Upending it, he sucks greedily at the bottle mouth, draining the last drop as if salvation or peace could be found somewhere in the dregs. His gaze turns to you.
<br><br>
"Oghma and Kakur! Oghma and Kakur! Oghma and Kakur!" To your horror, he begins to dance a crazed jig and chant 'Oghma and Kakur' over and over. He spins, and fixes you with an insane stare.
<br><br>
"Do you want to be a dwarf? I'm all hairy and short!" He sits down, and then, mercifully, passes out.
<br><br>
It's obvious that your leader is in no state to lead. You and your fellow members must get together to choose a new leader, and soon. Someone needs to act as archivist, too, since Ezmend seems to have gotten involved in another one of his schemes and has also been absent.

 <br><br>
I understand that you're busy and that Oghma is taking up a lot of your time and your having a blast playing him. That's fine. What I want to know is this: how many of you still want to do the FDM thing? 
<br><br>
Lets get a count on who wants to still do this and go from there. I still want to be involved in the FDM. I think it is a lot of fun and I enjoy the people in it. If we see that we still have some interest, then we can set up a new leader.

<br><br>
Just a little correction. I haven't lost interest in FDM, I've run out of hours in the day to do all my projects. This is my fault, as I am well-known for my enthusiasm for new projects, without checking on my ability to complete them due to old projects still running. 
<br><br>
FDM is dear to me, but I've got to start cutting somewhere. I'll pick up Tdaven when I can take a break, or when things calm down

Subject: RE: FDM Update
 <br><br>
I'll probably still play Gainam, regardless of the fate of the FDM. He'll be my primary if there is an FDM to play him with. If not, he'll fall to a secondary, or perhaps tertiary role. So, yes, I still want to be a part of the FDM.

Subject: FDM--The Future of Evil
 <br><br>
I am writing this little letter to start the ball rolling for our guild. 1st off, This is a rolecall. If you do not answer this e-mail, we will consider you not wanting to be a part of FDM anymore. I will give you all 3 days to answer this e-mail, in case some people are out of town or something. We should still have enough members that want to be in FDM, even on a part-time basis. 
<br><br>
After we find out where our membership is, we are then going to nominate a leader this coming week and then have him get us guilded. I have talked to some of you about being leader and most have no time to be leader. I personally might want to lead us and I know Beldro wants to as well. So, let us know if you might as well. We need to vote on a leader and get FDM guilded soon.
<br><br>
For those of you that might not continue with us, we are sorry to see you go. I know sometimes it's hard to play many characters or we love one more than the other, but you should think about maybe just going a bit inactive instead of leaving us.  Anyways, I think I have rambled on enough. It's now 6 am and Sinen made lvl 5 tonight. I had a blast! Even though Gainam almost lost his corpse =) Hope to hear from you all soon!

<br><br>
Well, Uadara will continue to participate in FDM. But don't expect her around a lot. Recently, I just haven't been playing EQ so much. I think I just burned out. When I do play, it's with Kakur, my primary character. Assuming I do start playing more, I'll be glad to join you all.

Subject: FDM- Follow the leader time.
 <br><br>
I am very pleased to announce that I have gotten positives from all of you. Everyone wants to stay in FDM in some fashion or another. Now we have to get down to the nitty gritty. We must pick a leader for FDM. I have talked to a number of you and you just don't have time to lead, which is fine. I would like to know if anyone wants to Lead or not. I think you all know that I wouldn't mind doing the job. It would be an honor for me to lead such a great bunch of people. I also know that Beldro has mentioned he wouldn't mind the job, too. So, there are two candidates. 
<br><br>
Whoever gets the job can get us set up with Verant and we can be on our way. I hope to see more of you in Neriak soon. 
 <br><br>

<br><br>
Beldro here. Looks like I'll be away for a 10 day stretch while I'm in the field. Ill be getting a few days off when i come back so expect some die hard EQing when I return =) Guess that puts me out of the running for leader, but I doubt I would get many votes since I'm so new to the group heh.

 <br><br>
Well. Nuuin was born, nearly lv3. Hard for me to put down my bard though. After 9 months of beta, and trying out ALOT of things I have not had the enjoyment I have had out of my bard. 
 <br><br>
 
From: "Sinen"<br>
Date: Thursday, April 15, 1999 1:48 AM<br>
Subject: First FDM Guild E-mail Sent to Verant. Now your turn.
 <br><br>
I sent off a list of only 9 people to Verant for the guild thing. Those in the e-mail are: Taedaryn, Zadrenya, (more on her in a moment) Nuuin, T'daven, Uadara, (I hope you didn't want an apostrophe there) Gainam, Orwin, (Ezmend's new char) Zass, and Tarien. (Ian) I left out Beldro and Bremanya just because Beldro is gone and I had already had enough when I got to Bremanya. Now it's your turn.
<br><br>
So, get off your butts and e-mail Verant NOW! =) I will let you know on the message boards what is going on with the approval process. We need more people posting anyway. Get on the boards and let's hear from you.
<br><br>
On the subject of Zadrenya. Everyone welcome a new member to FDM. This is Debbie. She is Amoroth's girlfriend and is a member with a number of us in StormWolves. Oghma never got around to officially introducing her to the guild. Welcome, Deb! Hope to see you and Amo in Neriak soon.
<br><br>
Seeyas all in Neriak! Long live the F'leurs DuMal!
<br><br> 

From: "Sinen"<br>
Date: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 2:11 PM<br>
Subject: FDM almost approved
<br><br>
Just wanted to let you all know that I got the first e-mail back from Verant. They said we are going to step 2 now, which is charter approval. I should hear something back from them in 24 hrs, it said. Well, at least the ball is a rolling again. If all things are said and done by Friday, I can get us all guilded on Sunday. 
<br><br>
I believe I welcomed Dach to FDM on the msg boards, but i would like to do so now in this guild e-mail. So, welcome Vamen to our Order. We trust you will cause pain and suffering, in the name of Innoruuk, everwhere you may travel. Again, welcome to the F'leurs DuMal. (hey! I spelled it right! hehe) 
<br><br>
I would like to ask you all about adding a friend to our ranks. His name is Gaelin. He and I have traveled quite a bit together. He is a lvl 9, almost 10, cleric of Innoruuk. I have known him since the start of final. Seems anymore, that he and I are sorta like Oghma and Kakur. 
<br><br></font>


Since this time, Sinen has had difficulties with his email and his ISP, but has revealed to us in chat that the charter approval has been completed and the guild would be activated.   Meeting times for the Guild GM's on the Karana server were of next interest, and the wait began.
<br><br>
Thus, a legacy was reborn. Sinen was the first among us to don the mantle of the F'leurs DuMal, and is a formidable ShadowKnight in his own right.  Gainam, though, was forced to chastise him mercilessly for speaking with a non-Teir'Dal recently in the Northern Desert of Ro, for in his longing for adventure Sinen became weak and actually associated with the tainted ones while combating Dervishes.  I was so ashamed to hear of this heresy. 
<br><br>
So it commences, the steady rise in power and might that I will use alongside my fellow F'leurs DuMal in ridding Nektulos of the trespassing other races.  Night after night, I take each challenge as it is discovered, learning what I can, honing my skills, and trying to drink Zadrenya under the table.  One day, that might and fury will rise up with the true voice of Innoruuk and allow us to finally purge Neriak of the deceitful, tainted Foreign Quarter's inhabitants and return Neriak to the Teir'Dal!
