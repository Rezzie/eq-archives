After my article on Paladins I began to wonder about religion in role-playing games.  Paladins are clearly organized around a Judeo-Christian "Golden Rule" ethic.  Why is it, then that so many role-playing games use another, usually polytheistic, religious systems? AD&D, for example, uses whole pantheons from elder mythos like the Babylonian or Scandinavian, but the setting is ultimately a medieval setting.  The medieval setting, one would assume, would include the Church as the single most powerful institution as part of it's milieu, but doesn't.  Why do semi-historical fantasy games rarely have the Catholic Church, or indeed any monotheism loosely based on Christianity included?
<br><br>
Early medieval theology is mostly concerned with integrating the demands of reason within the structure of faith in Christianity.  Many of the heresies during this period arise from logical inconsistencies in Church orthodox worship or issues of faith.  The issue of cults and polytheism can be loosely found in the witchcraft trials, but the Church was more concerned with people worshipping God incorrectly than those who don't worship God.
<br><br>
Barbarian societies, whether Scandinavian or Celt, had their own pantheons, but the Christian Church was quick to convert and absorb them.  Many gods and spirits were included in the list of saints, and for many pagans, the worship of the saint of (insert sphere of influence here) was enough to satisfy their pagan requirements.  Only truly organized pagan religions like that of the Druids held out for any length of time, but eventually died out, whether from forced conversions or the political benefits of switching to Christianity.
<br><br>
The Crusades, our source for many of the Paladinic ideals, were a battle between Islam and Christianity, both monotheistic religions.  The re-capture of Jerusalem from the "infidel" was a unifying and inspirational goal for Christians of the era, and a chance for loot and plunder for the non Christians who signed on with the Crusaders.  It is the essence, in many ways, of the ideal of the Golden Rule - except heretics were slaughtered, infidels were burned, and entire cities raped.  No irony there.   I guess the Golden Rule only applies to fellow Christians who worship the "correct" way.
<br><br>
So why, if the Christian Church dominated medieval life, is there such little mention of it in fantasy role-playing games?	
<br><br>
Role-players are, perhaps, skeptics.  Those of us who began playing in the 70's remember the Christian militants accusing us of Satanic worship.  Ignoring that the triumph of good over evil is one of the main themes of Dungeons and Dragons, Christian groups misquoted rule-books and pointed to the suicide of a troubled University of Michigan student who happened to engage in a form of "real-life" Dungeons and Dragons in the steam tunnels of the school as proof that role-playing games were the spawn of Lucifer.  I, for one, lost respect for many so-called Christian friends who behaved towards me much as the medieval Christian church did towards heretics.  Little wonder that fantasy worlds don't often include Christianity, with that bath of disillusionment provided by present-day fanatics.
<br><br>
The desire for an escape from reality may be part of that, too.  We don't have household gods anymore, except the Internet and the television, where we worship daily for hours :).  Maybe it would be helpful to make a little offering to Hermes before we set out to travel, or Aphrodite before a date.  The  lack of presence in our lives of these minor deities and the desire to control their aspects may be why we include them in our gaming.
<br><br>
Is there a spiritual component to role-playing worship? While the clerical characters I have played had a strong moral or ethical component, I am positive that my playing that character did not add to my spiritual experience.  It may have added to my moral and ethical development, however, and in that sense, perhaps prepared me to be more open to spirituality or spiritual thinking. That this was a direct result of my characters' religion, though, I sincerely doubt
<br><br>
With the rise of New Age religions and a re-interest in the Druidical and Wiccan traditions, more players will and are acting out or including their interests in their role-playing experience, which will definitely add color and depth to the environment in which it is played.  In their case, the in-game religious experience would truly approach a spiritual one.
<br><br>
The "fun" of polytheism, though, is why I like playing in polytheistic environments.  It's a great chance for creative oaths, and a chance to create tension based on religious worship not found in another milieu.  It adds depth to the gaming environment by creating a framework of behavior in which to operate.  Warriors can worship warrior gods, mages the gods of magic, and thieves the gods of thieves.  Gods are often archetypal characters like the Trickster or Ruler Gods, which help define how we want our characters to be seen.  'Worship", in any real sense, is rarely a part of it, however.  Perhaps a character wears a holy symbol, or makes donations to the church, but it is unusual for a player, even with a clerical character, to make much of their religion.  It is more for the "color" that we include religion at all in our games.
<br><br>
This is ironic, really, because to the typical fantasy <b>character</b>, the gods are more REAL to them then our own, real life religions.  Your typical fantasy character not only has belief and faith to guide them, but actual witnessed encounters with the gods themselves.  Occasionally a hero will receive an item from a god, or even become a god or demigod!  A fantasy characters' experience with religion is much more concrete than ours.  One wonders if that would make them more terrifying, or less.
<br><br>
EverQuest will present us with a new pantheon.  From what we understand so far, there will be real benefits/penalties to choosing a specific god/goddess.  Perhaps this choice will enable us to run an "aligned" character according to good/evil principles, much like the choice of race.  We can know that most trolls are evil, most gnomes are good (perhaps), and build our understanding of the world on solid fantasy principles. Based on the religious structure of Norrath.  We will read of their powers, and of their struggles and passions.  We will discover machinations and evil, hatreds, loves and the seekers of truth.  Let us engage in the history of Norrath as well as the framework given by the gods and goddesses to create a living, breathing, environment where our small victories are writ large in the tapestry of EverQuest life.
