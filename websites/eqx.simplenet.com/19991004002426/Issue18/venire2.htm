"I will never practice magic," I often told my father.  He would always look at me
with an appalling glare and chuckle like I was just some stupid kid. Then with a
sweep from his enormous hand, I would be cast to the side.  You could here him

since my father’s death.

flawlessly crafted and a credit to its surviving this long.  As usual Gosling read

his energy collected in his hands.  His pupils turned up into his head, leaving a
white empty stare.  It was actually frightening to watch.
