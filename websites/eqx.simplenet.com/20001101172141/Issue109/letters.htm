BRAVO ABSOR!!!!
<br><br>
I am so disapointed with Verant for the exact same reasons you mentioned.  I 
read the discussions on EQVault and it all comes down to a cop-out.  They 
have the ability to reduce out-of-game sales by 95% or more but *choose* not 
to.  Utterly pitiful.  Keep up the good work.

You make some good points as usual, but Verrant didn't copout by saying they lack the resources to police the internet.  As desire would be one of the resources and I don't believe Verrant has the desire to take on ebay.  Quite simply this is a game to make money.  If you spend money to legally shutdown the selling of equipment on ebay.  You will also cut of a good portion of you client base.  
 <br><br>
Do I think Brad Mcquaid invisioned this when he and his crew made the game?  No but the simple fact is they could not publish it themselves so enters Sony, so enters big business.  I believe this game will not be a "commercial succes" five years from know.  
 <br><br>
I disagree strongly about selling any virtual equipment on ebay, but some people do.  For a good majority of the people this is not a role playing game, they as you stated have turned a hobby into a job.

P.S. this was done on the fly with no deep thought so might be syntax and spelling errors.

<em>But that is my point.  Those that are treating the game as a business are destroying it for the rest of us.  Perhaps those people would quit if they were not allowed to sell their stuff on eBay.  But then, if they are allowed to continue a bunch of us that actually play the game for fun will probably quit.
 <br><br>
It's up to them which revenue they want to lose.
 <br><br>
Oh, and they don't have to 'take on' eBay.  eBay would likely be very agreeable to stopping the sales.

On your <a href="../Issue108/edita.htm">article about Ebay</a> ;)
<br><br>
I'm a long-time player of online games, I even implemented a few.  And even back in the good 'ol days of text base MU*'s some offline trading occurred.  I have to agree with you that it's reprehensible that Verant/Sony won't come out and flat out say that selling items on Ebay is illegal.  
 <br><br>
I was a Guide in the EverQuest guide program for a very long time as well, and I can tell you that ALL Guides were incensed the first time we saw Ebay items go up.  As a Senior Guide I regularly got emails about this or that item going up for trade on Ebay.  Not because I asked them to but because the Guides took it upon themselves to keep an eye on it.  Until we were told not to bother by Verant, that is.  "Nothing we can do about it, we can't police the internet".  But you know what?  They could have.  With well over 700 guides in the EverQuest guide program it would be very easy to do. 
 <br><br>
Now, I'm no longer a guide, I resigned over some personal issues as well as some issues with Verant, but mostly I just wanted to have a life again ;)  But your article was Right On The Money (ROTM!!!).  If Verant asked the players to let them know about Ebay or any other auctions.   The players would do it.  They'd be GLEEFUL about doing it as a matter of fact.  And we'd rapidly see the end of Item farming for Ebay.  Heck, we might even be able to use platinum to buy items in game again....
 <br><br>
Anyway, kudos on the clear vision you had in that Article.  Just wanted to thank you for seeing the forest for the trees.

Quake people arnt all bad
<br><br>
Hi iv been reading EQX since about issue 90 and i cant wait for it to come out each week. Anyways on with the letter =)
 <br><br>
    Iv been playing rpg's sice i was 5 years old and they are my favorite type of game. But also i am one of the best 
Half-Life/Team Fortress/Oposing Force players i have yet to meet now i got hooked on shooters when i played Quake for the first time. I have days where i just cant stand EQ! But there are also days that gibbing one more poor soul seems tedious. This said i havent played a text based rpg ever. i also have only played pencil and paper rpg's for small amounts of time; yet i find EQ is one of the best games i have ever played. Most of what i have just said goes for most of my friends as well.(im almost done =)  )  So all the bashing of people who play shooters and who also play on EQ might not be warranted. (hehe im finally done)
 <br><br>
P.S Oghma keep the Posy series going its great!!!!
