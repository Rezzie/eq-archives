<b>Qeynos Hills - </b>
<br><br>
Expectations are high for the three day festival of bards, jesters and all
around freaks called "Bardstock".
<br><br>
Several days in advance people have shown up at the standing stones in
Qeynos Hills and camped out in anticipation of the great string of acts who
are set to perform.  It's even rumored that our esteemed editor, Absor, will
appear on stage to perform a set alongside Bergin and the Firedrakes.
<br><br>
When campers at the site were polled to see which act they were waiting for,
all said they were waiting for someone called "Putrid skeleton", an act
which is not even listed on the bill.  Nonetheless, anticipation is high.
