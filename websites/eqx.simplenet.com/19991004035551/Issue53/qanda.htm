<H1> Q & A </H1>
<HR>
<I><B>Q:</B> When will phase 4 begin?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> As much as I would like the ability to look into Brad McQuaid's 
   head, we have no information on future dates of features or phases. 
<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B> When a bard plays a song, will we be able to hear the
   music?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> In this phase of beta, all the sound effects and music have not yet 
   been implemented.  As of this time, you do not hear any music when a
   bard is singing, but you do see a text message when the song begins, 
   when the effect triggers, and when the song ends.  You also see the
   magical special effects, as if a normal spell is being cast.

<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B> What are the penalties for death?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> This is being changed throughout the beta process, but the bottom 
   line is you lose a percentage of your experience points.  This can cause 
   you to lose a level if you have recently achieved that level.  You also 
   have to trek back to where you died and attempt to recover your corpse.

<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B> What is the lag like in EverQuest with a 28.8 modem?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> The EverQuest Express staff uses many different connection speeds, 
   from 28.8 to ISDN.  No one has reported any consistent trouble with lag.  
   You may load the next zone a few seconds slower with 28.8, but it is not a
   gameplay altering problem.  I am very impressed with how playable the game
   is, even when seeing moderate packet loss.  Keep in mind that many
   optimizations still have yet to be done, so I expect it will only improve
   with time.

<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B> How does the game run with a system that barely meets the 
   published minimum requirements? </I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Here is where you may see some framerate hits and choppy movement, 
   and even slower zone loading.  You can certainly play the game, but you 
   wont be running at a high resolution, and you may want to avoid mass 
   melees.  Optimizations will only help this as well.

<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B> Does equipment rust or wear out over time?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> As Brad revealed in an earlier IRC chat, no.

<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B> How does intelligence affect the ability to learn 
   languages?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> There is no limit to the number of languages you can learn at this 
   time.  Since each language is actually a separate skill, intelligence 
   affects your language learning the same way it affects all skill increases.
   The more intelligent you are, the faster your skills will increase.

<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B> How do languages work?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Through an in game menu, you can select which known language you 
   will speak.  If anyone in the area knows the language, they will receive 
   your message no different from speaking in Common.  If someone does not
   know the language, the message will be mixed up and look like gibberish.

<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B> How important is food and water?  Can someone be a good enough 
   forager that they never need to purchase rations?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Food and water is important enough that you will never want to be 
   without them.  Your character's HP and Stamina will not increase if you 
   are starving.  However, you cannot die from starvation.  Characters 
   with foraging skill can absolutely live off the land and never purchase 
   rations again.  Some magic classes can also summon food at will.

<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B> Can necromancers eat the dead instead of food?  Can trolls eat 
   opponents that he kills? </I><BR>
<B>A:</B> What is with you people? That's disgusting! Although it might fit with our ideas of RP, there is no way to eat the rotting, bloodied remains of hacked up corpses at this time. Some animals do give you meat that is edible, but you do not eat their corpses.

<BR><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B> Will we be able to keep our beta characters in the retail 
   version?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> This has not been announced, but we expect that you will <B>not</B> 
   be able to keep your beta characters after release.
