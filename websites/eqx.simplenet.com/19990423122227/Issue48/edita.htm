Last week's game was a complicated affair.  We were sent on a vacation.  Of course, on the trip back our ship sank.  We found ourselves being dragged from the surf by the house servants of one of the wealthiest men in the country.  I will endlessly chide our GM about the fact that not a single sailor survived the crash.  That seemed a bit odd.
<br><br>
The daughter of this wealthy man was getting married in a few short days.  Somehow we were invited to stay for the wedding.  Some of our more barbaric members wanted to head straight home.  But the rest of us convinced them to stay, as it could certainly help us to be seen at such an event.
<br><br>
The rest of the story is a painful tale of confusing Germanic names and twisted plot convolutions that could have been the plot of any bad mystery soap opera.  It turns out that the bad guy was a vampire, and he wanted the bride to be.  We were forced to hold him off until dawn and then seek out his coffin for a quick staking.  It's not really something that I could possibly explain.  Besides, I wanted to talk about another one of those inside jokes that our group has.
<br><br>
<b>"So what do you turn into?"</b>
<br><br>
Years and years ago I would attend every OrcCon/GenCon convention held in the Los Angeles area.  At those conventions there was this event called the Monster Mash.  A man named Bob Ferguson (think that's the spelling) built this fantastic castle.  It was huge.  It was scaled to fantasy miniatures.  And every level came off to expose the one below it.  The idea was to create a character by spending one million experience points with the rules they supplied, and use that character to assault the castle.  Not a roleplaying game, but one hell of a game.  I think I mentioned this before in an <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue19/editorial.htm">earlier editorial</a>.
<br><br>
Well, in one of those games I foolishly cast a polymorph self spell.  Now, I'm quite certain that Bob needed a better entrance exam for his helpers.  This guy asks me...  "What do you turn into?"
<br><br>
I tell him, "Nothing."
<br><br>
He says, "So you don't cast the spell?"
<br><br>
I say, well, at first nothing.  I kinda just looked up at him and cocked my head.
<br><br>
"Um, no, I still cast the spell."
<br><br>
"Then what do you turn into."
<br><br>
Now I know that this spell allows you to turn into different things.  That's the nature of the spell.  What I'm thinking at this point is that I have been up way too long to put up with this.  It was about round five or six in the game.  Each round took close to an hour.  Mostly due to the large number of players (around twenty for each game), but I suspect that this guy had something to do with it as well.  So it was probably close to 10 pm, and we were looking at quitting around 5 am.  We'd all been up since 8 am. that morning.  So knowing that this guy was going to be my GM for the next 8 or 9 hours was a frightening thing.
<br><br>
"I don't turn into anything, I just cast the spell..."  hoping beyond all my expectations that by repeating this answer enough times I could get him to understand what I was saying.
<br><br>
"Then you don't..."
<br><br>
"Okay! Okay!  I turn into myself!"
<br><br>
"Okay."
<br><br>
Completely unfazed, he turned to the next guy and asked him what he wanted to do for that round.
