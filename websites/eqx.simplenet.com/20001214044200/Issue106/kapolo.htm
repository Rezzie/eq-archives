I stride through the gates of Qeynos. I am a young enchanter of the world of Norrath but the thing is, I wasn't supposed to become one. My feet, slight wobble from my hunger, carry me to the nearest vendor and I request a smattering of bread and Elven wine. Without reaction, the vendor calmly stated that they did not have any more wine and had to settle for some ale. My tastes are fine, but right now, the sweat of ogre would be pleasing.
<br><br>
A worn chair near the stage welcomes me into its fold. Looking up to the stage, a bard is weaving a tune very complex that it is a wonder they do not make mistakes. Larrk, my fellow bard, did tell me young bards do make mistakes.  He also told me when one of these students is near, it is suggested you move far away or your ears will literally bleed. Fortunately, I did not yet have to deal with this affliction but many bar locals seem to have a hard time hearing. 
<br><br>
I withdraw my cape and watch the bard play. She is a half elf, and a follower of Erollisi Marr as suggested by her runes and decorations of faith adorning her tunic and sleeves. My clothes do not have enhancements of any kind, devoting my life to any god.
<br><br>
I am agnostic.
<br><br>
I get up from my chair and walk out of the door, not drawing the attention of any of the locals. My cape is on again, flowing over any stone or any unevenness of the land. My cape is passive to any barrier in its way. As is anyone towards me.
<br><br>
Not a eye is directed to me as I walk through the darkened alleyways. Even the smugglers sneaking through their secret passage don't look at me, though they are probably more intent on the passing guards then a minor elf like me.
<br><br>
My veins actually pulse the very essence of Tunare, as does the entirety of my family. A noble family of paladins and clerics, some of the very best with strong ethics, pride, and honor. Each child of the family L'Arety would be offered to Norrath as squires, to be taught of the ways of the battleground. We were usually picked very quickly for the respectability of the family was great in the world.
<br><br>
A pause comes to my travels as I see an aged man, by the corner of the Fish's Ale, selling apples for five copper. He looks at me with great fear and anger for some reason unknown. I leave and change my form into that of a human and mentally suggest to him, "I am your friend and I do not want to hurt you." He lessens the charge to four copper. I still give him five coins, saying the extra was a tip. I know he will be surprised in the morning when his eyesight gets better and finds the coin I gave him is gold. I would sure love to be there to see the gleam of joy in his eye. Alas, I will be heading back to Freeport... back near the dark hole in the ground named Neriak, home of the accursed dark ones.
<br><br>
Dark elves weren't even able to make it across the ocean and even if they did, get that far into the Faydark. The Storm Guards of Kaladim and the Paladins of my home have signed many pacts with each other to prevent this from happening. At least until the sightings of a true dark elf running right outside the gates of Felwithe were reported and the guards increased their rounds of the premises. Any activity outside was prohibited until more was known.
<br><br>
Speaking of prohibited, seems walking in the middle of the night is kind of shadowy. A Guard approaches and asks me to find an inn or be punished. It is still a good night for a stroll so I try to suggest that I am not causing any trouble. It fails to hold in his brain patterns so I must find shelter.
<br><br>
He guides me to Sneed Galliway's place of work since all the other inns were closed. Sneed was so kind to me... after I made him so... that he offered me his spare bed while many other adventurers had to camp downstairs. The bed was nothing to write home about... straw and cloth... but it seemed like a luxury to be in such fine bedding when last week my place of rest was under a thick oak wrapped in with my cape and some decaying leaves spread for warmth. 
<br><br>
My trip was long and arduous from the green valley of the Faydark. How else can a enchanter become anything in this world when all you fight are the orcs in Crushbone? I have traveled to the Ferrott and helped the Ogres smash "some of the lizzes" (taught by the everlarge Pozak), the Lava Storm mountains, and the frosty peaks of Everfrost. With many I have grouped and many, sadly, have died before me. Some of my cohorts have gotten down on their knees and prayed from mercy from one of these gods... but the gods did nothing to prevent that last mammoth gore or the orc warrior bash. All they could do was become complacent and stare up at the sky with eyes filled with hope, to be drained...
<br><br>
The eyes...
<br><br>
Glowing a bright blue in the dark right outside Felwithe, my kin failed to notice her impending doom. The pair of little spots moved with an unwavering direction towards my beloved sister. Higher up, two brighter green spots moved all around as coordination was not the dark pet's better side. Just death and more death was their job, and with an axe they did it well.
<br><br>
Keria, my sister, was out in the forest, training herself in the ways of the Paladin. It was the night when the proclamation of staying inside the city was announced by the guards. My sister, though tall and with blond silken hair, failed to be noticed by the passing couriers of the news. 
<br><br>
She just slew another orc and beamed as she found a gold in its pockets. The necro beamed a smile as well, bright white, enough for Keria to notice. The sword came quickly up.
<br><br>
The family house on the river running through the city seemed a little empty to me. Many of my relatives and friends dwelt in this house. It in itself was a temple to the god Tunare. Symbols of devotion and runes of praise lined the walls as did etching of each generation of the family L'Arety. Each picture hung whenever the official rank of squire was given. A Paladin had already chosen Keria to be hers and the wonderful oak carving lay on the wall under it's future spot. 
<br><br>
Wondering what was missing, I saw the freshly done picture on the floor and sprinted to the gates. Passing a barricade of guards, I flashed the medallion L'Arety to show it was an emergency and they quickly stepped aside to make way. I'm coming my dear sister...
<br><br>
With each slash Keria took, the Necromancer seemed to dodge. The skeleton named Genarb pummeled the future paladin with bony hand, leaving a welt after each landing. The simple healing my sister could do was not enough to take on the combined combat of the necro, the pet, and the necro's spell of continuing weakness. Every so often, the dark embodied quickly cast a green noxious cloud that seemed to close his few wounds and open a number too many to count on the young woman.
<br><br>
On her knees, fists still clenched on her symbol of faith, she muttered her last resort. She waved a symbol in the air and her necklace filled hand touched her chest. All of her wounds closed and she calmly got up... only to be hit down again with a more powerful spell the dark mage cast.
<br><br>
Over the last hill I went and saw the young holy fighter touching her chest. She is using the healing touch... I might still have time. As I leaped over an orc with change spilling out of it's pouch, I readied Justice, my bronze long sword I was very fond of. I ran, but too far away for the mage to get in one more casting...
<br><br>
A stream of blue was created between the hand of the dark elf and my sibling. Her mouth yelled out incredible pain but as the energy making the sound was drained, the voice was decreasing in volume. Tears in my eyes, I threw myself to catch my fallen sister and tried to use my healing touch on her limp body. She was too far gone.
<br><br>
The dark elf saw my sword at the ready and my armor glinting in the moonlight that actually got through the trees. He knew I was too much of a match and sent his pitiful pet at me. One slice severed the head from the body of the undead and as I recovered from the slash, the foe was nowhere to be seen.
<br><br>
I stuck my sword into the thick mossy earth, went back to Keria's body and knelt down with my head on my knee. Her mouth was closed now as her head was tilted back. Her hair made a wide circle around her head as some sort of halo and her green eyes with the glow of red fading, my father's, just stared at the high moon. I took her hand and out fell the amulet of Tunare that was strung around her pale neck. The impression of the symbol made a reddish form in the palm from how tightly she held the symbol... Her faith.
<br><br>
She called and Tunare did not listen. The healing touch was what someone in belief would be able to use, but Tunare must have seen that a Dark Elf in the Faydark is no match for a minor warrior. Why did he do nothing?
<br><br>
I picked up Keria's now limp corpse and walked back to the huge gates of Felwithe. The guards ran up and backed away as they saw my sister in my arms. Local clerics began to walk beside me canting prayers to make her journey to the other side a safe one. Other side or no, at least she is no longer suffering the intense pain I saw.
<br><br>
I entered Household L'Arety and laid her on her bed and everyone in the house waited at the door. I stood there a minute and brushed a stray hair off her face. Like it really mattered now. I began to put on my bronze gauntlets, but stopped in the middle of the act. I left them off. I then took off my helmet and tunic then left the room.
<br><br>
As I walked down the corridors, I slowly began detaching my armor from my person and threw it to the floor as I walked. By the time I exited the house, I was completely naked of all armor and my cloth undergarments showed. I dove into the river and swam to the bottom. Once there, beginning to feel the effects of the pressure, I withdrew Justice from my scabbard for the last time and stuck it between two rocks. Wedged, it could not be easily removed now or much later.
<br><br>
I came out of the water and yet no one said anything about the act I just preformed. I calmly stated my armor was for any of those pure at heart and walked to the peaceful lake further up the river.
<br><br>
The cool air of Qeynos hit my face as I awoke in the morning. The Erudin Crossing is giving a mist throughout the city, making the smiths heat the coals a bit hotter and sailors to squint a bit more. Thick like the sense of the love I left about my home of Felwithe. I should really miss the smiles and hugs given freely in the House of L'Arety, but then I have to think of the terrible things that happened that one night. 
<br><br>
I visit Crow's Tavern for another drink before I leave. As I pass through the door, several fishing poles are lined up along the foyer. I sure liked to fish back then...
<br><br>
Like my childhood, I asked the nearby vendor for a fishing pole and some bait. He gave me the bait and tackle to me without word or charge. I sat at the edge of the lake and tried to lure some kind of creature from the bottom. I then look up. I see a massive portal house to the three branches of magic. Since my family has no business in the "hocus pocus" I usually ignored the sounds of magic and concentrated on catching one of the trout.
<br><br>
Though today, the casting sounded interesting for some reason. Curiosity got the best of me and I slowly walked up the ramp. I opened the door and saw a table in the center of the room, strewn with jewelry and glowing stones. In the middle, was the face of my sister. Not a picture, mind you, but a image floating in the air. I rushed to the nearest dress wearer, lifted him up, and slammed him against the wall. "WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS! " I demanded. Then I felt limp and my feet began being wrapped by ethereal roots. My strength was draining and I could no longer hold the man in the air. 
<br><br>
"Do not worry friend, it is in honor of your sister. Nothing more," the robed person stated.
<br><br>
I again looked at Keria's face. It was honored with expensive jewels that glowed with energy and wisps circled around the floating visage. Why would these people do this? She was a Paladin and had nothing to do with the casters of pure magic. Why would they honor someone who had nothing to do with them... unless...
<br><br>
I then remembered she often went missing for hours at a time. These absences were her own time and the family let it go thinking she was just exploring somewhere... but never thought she could be exploring the inner reaches of magic.
<br><br>
The kind man showed me her "study". It was in the basement of the Enchanter's Guild and consisted of a desk and several tomes. The man, who's name I found out was Kureo and was just a visiting enchanter, told me that the tomes that now lie still and unturned were priceless and only those who were trained in mind could use them. My pride in my sister grew ten fold.
<br><br>
He saw these gleam in my eye, but didn't respond to it. He further introduced me to the Guild Leader of the Felwithe Enchanter's Guild. The guild master handed me a slightly torn robe seeing that I was beginning to shiver from the cold that was rolling in. It was an old rag. But donning it, I felt something shocking leak into me. I gasped and the two men seemed very surprised.
<br><br>
"Noble Paladin, did you just gasp from some kind of power?" Kureo asked.
<br><br>
"Yes... I did. I felt it as soon as I put on the cloth this kind fellow gave me," I replied.
<br><br>
The two enchanters turned away from me and discussed something hard and fast. I heard mention of my sister and the thought she was the only one, and something else about converting.
<br><br>
They turned back to me and showed me a piece of parchment. They asked if I could understand it and memorize it. It took me awhile to make heads and tails of it, but I finally figured out the patterns and realized that I could now grasp something from far away and squeeze it's throat. 
<br><br>
Surprised at my accomplishment, they asked me a question that I still do not even know now was the best choice for me. I was a L'Arety being asked to be a finger wiggler. Pride, honor, and faith prevented any member of the House L'Arety from joining a guild of what they considered to be for those for the weak in body relying only on the mana that we used to enhance and heal.
<br><br>
Those eyes, intelligence wavered throughout Keria's bright green eyes. I could see it all now. She was not meant for the life of a healer who would battle every thing in her path for the lay of hands on a dying ally. By Faydark! That is why she still used the short sword. Her intense studies have trained the mind but not the body.
<br><br>
I tried to push the idea of becoming one of them out of my mind for what seemed an eternity. Then I weighed the fact I had no belief in the god that I worshipped for the past decades of my life. I then saw no reason to fight for a god that I had no trust in.
<br><br>
I shuddered that I could no longer lead the life I dreamed as a child. Walking into the middle of the battlefield and seeing the hearts of countless raise knowing that a L'Arety paladin was in their midst. Laying hands on someone as low ranking as a squire, because I couldn't let any one die. Drain my entire wisdom into healing the warrior dealing the final blow to the orc leader while myself being torn by orc centurions.
<br><br>
As I strolled out the next day, the guards wondered where I was going. Kureo made them forget I ever existed. "It will be much easier," he explained to me. He shook my hand and gave a quick hug before I walked down the path of the hill in front of the High Elf city. 
<br><br>
Keria, I will remember you...
<br><br>
It is now my time to leave this city. I pick up my runed staff and proceed to walk out the gates of the Human city. I turn my head to gaze at the slowing shrinking city. I laugh to myself for if I squint it looks like my home, Felwithe. 
<br><br>
Maybe I will visit, but am I ready for the pain? Am I ready to face my family? Am I ready to live with myself once there?
<br><br>
I also do not know if my lack of faith in Tunare has banished me forever from the house. Ah, another thing I have to be ready for. 
<br><br>
"It will be a long walk," I think to myself as I fumble for my jewelcraft book. I walk into the Karanas with one hand holding the book, and the other my staff. Many runes adorn this staff, much of it gnoll, some in a tongue I have never heard of before, but I know one very well. Many do not see this rune. It is always held tightly under the grip of my hand. With a diamond Kureo lent me, I carved something to give me luck whenever I need the strength. Keria L'Arety
<br><br>
I shall always hold you in my heart, dear sister. Maybe I will find peace with myself enough to start believing.
