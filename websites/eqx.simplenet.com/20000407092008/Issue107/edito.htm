Well, I've gone and lost everything on my hard drive, and some of the things were unfinished stories that were started months ago, and I guess will never be finished.  One of the things it did do was to force me to get a new hard drive, and this on is faster and nicer and my load times are much faster.  But enough about my troubles - Happy New Year!
<br><br>
I have done an unprecedented thing these past weeks - I've stuck with the same character for three weeks - and Posy has reached that wizard milestone, 20th level.  I have had a blast doing it, and have learned much about grouping as a wizard.  Oxesiess and I are working on a huge and hopefully comprehensive guide to grouping, which we hope to finish soon.
<br><br>
Recently I saw a poll on EQSS which asked players how long they intended to play EQ.  The answers ranged from "I'm quitting now" to "As long as I can" and as of this morning, <b>61%</b> of the almost 9000 responding have answered "As long as I can".  I find this really interesting - because if you read the news posts, you begin to think that everyone hates EQ, they are only waiting for their account to run out to quit, and Verant is in the process of screwing the gaming community.  It really annoys me.
<br><br>
Those of us who come from a MUD background are more laid back about the issues that drive people nuts, such as nerfing and camping and overcrowding, because we know what it's like to be part of a community where changes to the game are more taken in stride.  Changes always will happen, and not all of them will be liked.  Game issues do need adjustment, and players should and do speak up about what bothers them.
<br><br>
Players, though, are not always the best judges of what is good for the game.  I remember when the team server was started, it crash instantly because of the massive interest in the new server.  Anti-Verant rants screamed about how Verant screwed up, about how they should have been more prepared, how they "deliberately" planned the server crashes - in other words, any invective that could have been aimed at them was, and with a nasty sort of glee.  Verant added a second server, and I <a href="../Issue85/edito.htm">predicted</a> that a few months down the road the two servers would have half the interest they have now. Sure enough, there has been talk recently of merging the two servers, since the population peaks at about 800 at the busiest times.
<br><br>
Verant makes mistakes and they 'fess up to it when they do and fix it when they can - like the recent Shaman alchemy bug.  They are not perfect, but they do have a vision of what EQ should be like and it appears that people overall like it.  
<br><br>
Recently they opened a new server (the Lanys server), and sure enough for a few days it had a higher population than any other server than perhaps Fennin Ro.  There were complaints then about how it was more crowded than the older servers, and how it didn't fix the overcrowding process - this from a server whose entire population is in the 1-8th level range.  Relax, folks. Sheesh.
<br><br>
I'm going to play Posy on Karana as long as I have the momentum for her, then go back to Oghma for a bit - and then I might play on Test - but what I will do is play, and have fun, and enjoy myself.  Give me a tell if you see me!
