<b>Orcs Beg for Help</b>
<br><br>
BlackBurrow... In an unexprected turn of events, this week an urgent plea was sent out from the orc king for any of those races that are friendly to his cause to send him supplies and goods.
<br><br>
"The war torn land of Black Burrow is beset with outsiders," he said in a statement yesterday, "There are so many and they are so brazen that they just sit in our camp and wait for one of us to poke our head out of a tent so they might slice it off!"
<br><br>
Among the things requested were a fresh supply of mead and new weapons.
<br><br>
Several political figures were reached for comment.  Antonius Bayle, who is currently embroiled in his own sex scandal at home, replied, "Anyone who assists will be stopped by those gallant men and women we've sent to keep the peace".
<br><br>
<b><em>Rumor of the week</em></b>:  A number of figures have been struck down by the enigmatic beings calling themselves the GM, for being abusive to others.  Word is promptly circulated throughout the land and the perpetrator's name is known to all.  And the people rejoice.

<b>This Date in Ro</b>
<br><br>
Today in the Oasis of Marr a massacre occurred. Three ogres and a troll were
seen killing a small village of fishermen. The largest of the three ogres
kept shouting “Ohaobol crush puny humans. Make you sorry you make fun of
Ohaobol!” If any of these murderers are seen in the vicinity, report them to
the East Freeport Militia immediately. (see attached photo.)

Lately in the Feerrott there has been a mass invasion of humans, elves, and
halflings. Rumor has it they are attempting to cleanse the south of its evil
roots. When Bouncer Flerb, the guardian of the bridge in the Feerrott, was
asked for a comment he reportedly stated “Bouncer Flerb smash you! Tear you
limb from limb!” No further questions were asked of him.
<br><br>
Late last night in Innothule swamp the Frogloks tried to invade Grobb. They
seemed to have had enough of  the wretched trolls invading Guk. The
casualties were slim on the troll side, but the Frogloks paid dearly for
their foolishness. A bystander was quoted as saying “Silly froggies. Basher’
s kill em quick and eat em raw!”
