(Okay, so we don't have Razor to kick around anymore.  Somebody needs to inject some real-life into our petty game squabbling.  Here goes!)
<br><br>
Urban legends, some call them.  They're modern stories of daring deed and, quite often, incredible stupidity.
<br><br>
Who does not quake in fear when being told the tale of the hooked killer who stalked lover's lane.  Who can deny the excess of the tales of use of Spanish Fly and powdered rhino horn.  Who does not cringe when they hear the story of Richard Gere's anus versus the Gerbil.
<br><br>
Ah, but these are true because your friend knows someone who knows a guy who was there.
<br><br>
Well, the tale of bucketman is somewhat closer to home than an urban legend, for you see, bucketman lived in my very household.  He was tall, tallest of all us (until my brother and I each reached 18 and shot past him).  But for much of my life he was a giant, with a great salt-and-pepper mane of hair and a cheesy Dennis Weaver mustache (The old McCloud T.V. Series form the 70's.  Too dated a reference for ya?  Get lost, boy, ya bother me).
<br><br>
Because of his many long days spent in the sun (and because we lived in orange county) he was often called compadre or señor, though his name and stock were actually Irish.  And when he removed his shirt or wore short pants the true Irishness of his being shown through in a glaring pasty-white glamour that would make a white russet scream with envy for want of such a complexion.
<br><br>
His black socks were worn in order to reveal the greatness of such pale legs and to compliment the abundance of black fur which flowed over those mighty drumsticks.
<br><br>
His hands were covered with cuts and calluses from his work in the frozen food mines at the local grocery store, and his tie was always splattered with crumbs from his nightly rummaging through the store's "open" and "returnable" food containers.
<br><br>
There was not a morsel of food in our house that could hide from him.  His wiry frame was deceptive for his was the ability, like the mighty ant, to eat many times his own weight.  Ice cream, peanut butter, not a soda cracker or can of beer were safe.  And everywhere he went the smell of tobacco followed like the brimstone of some great beastly dragon-turned-man.
<br><br>
The phrase "bucketman" was first spoken by a comedian on television.  His name has long since been forgotten by any of the family.  We simply remember the punchline of a joke wherein the comedian shouts into the microphone, "Buckteman lives!  Bucketman Lives!".
<br><br>
The true bucketman, who would not be dubbed with that name for years to come, held powers beyond those of any mere family head.  You see, the greatest power of this man was of his ability bend time and space and the long believed solid laws of geometry.
<br><br>
Most heads of household have this ability.  If you stand in the doorway for what seems like a few seconds, then you've "Left the door open long enough to heat the whole neighborhood".  And if you say something smart mouthed then it's "Way past your bedtime".  But bucketman's hold reality is truly legendary.  The fish he caught were bigger than they seemed, his work day was longer than anyone else's and every time he lay his head down for a nap it was only for "just a few minutes", yet he somehow bewitched the clock (and sometimes the calendar) to show that this period was much longer.
<br><br>
So what is bucketman's origin?  All the greats have an origin tale.  Was he from Krypton?  Was he at ground zero of a nuclear bomb?  Did he unload one too many cases of radioactive frozen food off of the delivery truck?  Perhaps some of these are true, but with all urban legends the edges are blurry.
<br><br>
Popular legend has it that he was a mediocre to poor student in school, but by the time my brother and I were born he had somehow changed reality to make himself a straight-'A' student.  His powers might have been simply attributed to latent mutancy and simply have exploded into being as he grew, such as is the case with many of the X-men.  But I believe that there were factors that amplified his ability to change reality.
<br><br>
These factors were 120mg and 40 proof.
<br><br>
Both the secret records of the Marlboro corporation and of Anheiser-Busch show the real truth, but these documents shall remain forever secreted, for the strange collision of events that led to the birth of bucketman shall never again be repeated.
<br><br>
It's no wonder the tobacco companies deny their products change the human physiognomy.  Because if the truth were ever released by a mole deep inside their corporation, we would all go around warping reality, belching smoke like dragons and reeking of distilled spirits.
<br><br>
60 Minutes once tried to tell the tale of the origin of bucketman.  The long-standing tale is that their lawyers pulled the tale out of fear of litigation.  But the truth is that the corporate muckety-mucks feared reprisal from those at the very top of the two corporations who had harnessed the world changing powers and feared that they would be used to rub them out of existence if the story ever aired.  Instead, Morly Safer did a story on child safety seats that week.
<br><br>
All those years I had believed that bucketman's power was more myth than fact, despite what my eyes had beheld many times.  Yet there came a time when I too had to fold to the strength of the bucketman myth.
<br><br>
This was the night of the great rainstorm.  Outside my Southern California apartment which I shared with my brother there was a horrendous shower which washed away the things on our patio and which continued to rattle off of the window.  The phone rang and I discovered bucketman was on the other end.
<br><br>
After some discussion of rain we surmised that the rain was equally bad in his location as in mine.  His apartment was not as secure as ours and he told tale of how he fought the leaking roof with ingenuity.
<br><br>
"You see, I've placed a bucket beneath the leak in the roof.  And I've taken that bucket and placed it inside another larger bucket, so that I can collect twice as much rain."
<br><br>
"You what?" I asked, incredulous at the idea that he could fold geometry to meet his pedestrian needs, "You placed what where?"
<br><br>
"I took a big bucket and put it under the leak.  Then I placed a smaller bucket inside it so that when it overflows I can still catch twice as much rain."
<br><br>
Somehow I had difficulty comprehending this.  I complimented him on his control of physics and passed the phone to my brother who listened intently with an equally incredulous grin on his face to the explanation of this man's victory over the elements and the concept of "volume".
<br><br>
Upon completion of the discussion my brother hung up the phone.  Whereupon I shouted the cry which shall forever be the battle cry of this champion of uncommon sense.
<br><br>
"Bucketman Lives!  Bucketman Lives!"
<br><br>
We don't see bucketman much these days.  But there are still hints of him all around us.  Whenever a man boasts of the great sales at his store, yet fails to purchase anything… Bucketman is there.  Whenever a man devours a whole steer with a side order of buffalo, bucketman is there!  Whenever a man boasts of the healing powers of limburger cheese, bucketman is there.  And whenever a writer needs a cheep laugh at someone else's expense, bucketman is there!
<br><br>
Here's to you, bucketman!  Don't let reality hold you down.
