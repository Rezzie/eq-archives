Hey ya's Boglak, dis da Oxes.  Dunno yer Auntie dat ya's wrote to, but I's can helps ya's, since I's gots da letter and all dat.  Welpers I thinky jist bout everything except da giants a lil'un to ya's, which means der's lots and lots o lil'uns. So thinky bout dat jist a sec.  Okay done thinky about dat?  Good...  Now why they smack da snott outta him.  See.. I's know dis FlooterTooter, Tarell.  Now he comes a sing'n in da jungle.  He's not doin a thingy, jist sing'n in da jungle.  Dunt matter where he comes in ta da jungle, faster than ya's can swing two mino axes der's Bouncer a try'n to thwap him.  So dat's why all da lil'uns ya see a thwap'n yer Bouncer, cause der's no music while da blood and guts are a flyin.

<em>Dear Oxesiess,
<br><br>
I beening one of derm der Paladin types have always been interested in named point shiny bits.  I loves it when da shiny bit that I use to clease the evil of the souls of the unbelievers of the lands of the godless ones has a name.  It makes it  that much more personal ta me. But I cannot seem to find that many swords with names I have two now and they only seemed to be named after their creators.  Any leeds on any really good named swords?
