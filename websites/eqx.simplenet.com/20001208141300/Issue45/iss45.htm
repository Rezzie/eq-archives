Our next issue is number 46, and it will be coming out on October 31st.
<font color="#ff6600"><b>HALLOWEEN!</b></font>  So we have decided to dedicate
that issue to tales of horror from Norrath.  If you have any terrifying stories
to tell, articles about the dead, or any artwork 
suitable to frighten, send them in!  Please try to get them in before the 29th, so that 
we'll have time to review them before publication.

Recently I was blessed with yet another organizational change at work, which ended up moving me into another area within my company.  I'm not one to complain, I like a change from time to time.  But corporate America seems to think if a team is working great together, and things are getting done, it can only mean they need to be re-org'd and split up.  But I won't go there (growl).

While we wait for EverQuest to reach open beta, we at EverQuest Express like
to pretend we are already playing the game.  Here we offer a humorous look
at what our staff could be doing if this were true.  Watch this space, as a 
new staff member will be featured each week.  This week, Keafa.

Rain had whipped in gusts before bellowing winds 
across the cobbled avenues of roaring Freeport. With a keen gasp and 
whistle it blew, ringing the fleeting droplets into almost horizontal 
flight. The lumbering roars of distant thunderclaps could be heard out 
over the sightless sea, with only the flashes of pink-blue lightning to 
offer quick glimpses of her blackened mirror breast.

Got your attention with that title?  Good.  I'd say the buzz about the beta is near a fever pitch.  We've got one newsgroup that is flooded with messages about what a group of disgruntled testers have to say about the game.  On the other group they've receded quietly into fantasy and are running their own campaign in the newsgroup-Re-establishing the tradition of storytelling that was once the mainstay of the Avault forum.everquest group.

Near the end of the first age, when Veeshan's brood was engaged in vicious battle with the denizens of the Underworld for mastery of the Overworld, the Father of the Kuldar was sorely beset. Having fought dragonkind for a thousand years, and prevailing, but barely, over dragonkind, Kul despaired for his people. He could no longer watch the Kuldar dying under the claws, teeth and breath of Veeshan's brood, and decided to seek out Brell Serilis.

Let me get this out of the way first.  Some of you may have read my <a href="../Issue41/edita.htm">editorial</a> in issue 41.  Well, the basic idea was that I once complained that the folks that play mages aren't too bright, and tend to blast the party with their magic too often.  Well, I guess I ain't to bright either.  My brand new character, a brand spanking new campaign, my very first spell...  Whack.  Got two enemies, myself, and the big fighter type.  Fire hurts.  I knocked my own character to the floor, as close to dead as you can get.  The fighter was hurt, but not too badly.  And I got the enemies fairly well.  But I still did exactly what I spend so much time complaining about.  Maybe just playing a magic user causes brain damage.  But I don't want to talk about that anymore.

To Absor and the crew,
<br><br>
I believe the most excited I got about a game, previous to my awaiting the
birth of Norrath, was when I first got the boxed set to 'Forgotten Realms'
(TSR). I would read and reread the many character histories and be transported
to somewhere far away. I would dream of becoming part (figuratively speaking)
of this other world where there were heroes that you would love to follow,
villians you would loathe, yet understand, fantastic adventures and treasures
waiting to be won. I would take my friends with me on these adventures and try
to share the wonder I felt for this new world.
