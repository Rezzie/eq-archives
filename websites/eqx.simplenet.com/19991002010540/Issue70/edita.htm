The Three Little Pigs.
<br><br>
And we huffed, and we puffed, but we had one heck of a time killing them.
<br><br>
Odd how such a brutal thing as the wolf hunting and killing the pig for food can be twisted into a lesson for children about not being lazy and doing things the right way (at least I think that was the moral of that one, I never listened to the moral part when I was a kid).  And in truth many of the fairy tales that folks read to their children today come from much older works that you would not really want your children to read.  Now I'm no expert, but I did a little research.  Did you know, for example, that Sleeping Beauty was raped by the so-called Prince Charming in many of the old tales?  Many of the originals are nasty like that.
<br><br>
If your interested, a good starting place for discovering the tales behind the tales is <a href=http://www.darkgoddess.com/fairy/>Fairy Tales: Origin and Evolution</a>.  Fairy tales can be great inspiration for characters or whole game settings.  I suggest that you look into the myths and folks tales of all sort of people.  There is some very interesting stuff out there.
<br><br>
I was once ran a campaign based on the Arabian world of TSR called Al Qadim.  But it was only afterwards that I picked up a book of Arabian folklore.  I wish I had read it before I wrote the games.  I certainly couldn't have used most of the stories directly as a basis for any of my games.  But reading the fables of a people really does give you a sense of who they are.  The tales of the Arabians seemed, to me anyway, to be based on concepts of pure elemental nature.  Obviously they are filled with things like Efreet and Djin, noble creatures that embody the elements themselves.  But the people of the tales are the same way.  All of them noble in one way or another.  Even the worst of men seemed to be enveloped in, or formed out of, the strength and whims of the elements.
<br><br>
The same can be said of the legends of Japan.  If you are thinking of playing an Ogre, read up on the legends of the Oni.  They definitely won't fit the mold of Ogres in Norrath.  But perhaps some insight can be found there.
<br><br>
In the tale we were building last weekend, six werewolves were barely enough to ruin the three little pigs' day.  These were not the cute little porkers that we know from the cartoons.  These were Skull Pigs.  Huge, disgusting, disease-ridden monsters.  Each of these things was easily a match for any one of our group of young wolves.  But, for once, we worked pretty well as a team, and won out.  We blew their houses down.
<br><br>
Sorry for the short editorial this week (I know you're not sorry though), but I'm not ready to write a full treatise on the value of folk lore and fairy tales for roleplayers, maybe later.
