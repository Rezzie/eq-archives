Winter paced back and forth along the catwalk, growling.  Leaning against the rail, intently sharpening the head of a hunting arrow, was Maesyn True, Ranger Guildmaster of Kelethin and unquestionably the greatest hunter in all of Faydwer.  Periodically, he would lift his gaze to the pacing half-elf, then return it to his work.
<br><br>
"Dammit there must be SOMETHING we can do!"  Winter turned and glared at the elven Ranger, her eyes clear and cold as her namesake, furious that he could remain so calm and collected.
<br><br>
"What can be done is being done.  We wait."  Maesyn did not look up but continued his sharpening.
<br><br>
Winter stood there, glaring at him for a moment before realizing it was not getting her anywhere, then she resumed her pacing.
<br><br>
After a little longer, she stopped and nodded her head, as if she had decided on something, turned and made to walk away.
<br><br>
"No, you won't," said Maesyn.
<br><br>
Winter turned and regarded him in her best attempt at innocence.  "Won't what?"
<br><br>
"Won't go after them."  The Guildmaster finished sharpening the arrow, slid it back into his quiver, then met Winter's innocent gaze with his own unsettling one.
<br><br>
Winter tried to smile, though with the strain on her it appeared more like a grimace.  "Why, whatever do you mean?"
<br><br>
Maesyn's stern countenance broke into a smile as he chuckled at her.  Furious, Winter stalked off, feeling her Guildmaster's laughter following her down the catwalks.
<br><br>
Cursing and swearing to herself, she stalked along the roped bridges and almost ran into Ozymandius as she rounded a corner.  She took in a breath to berate him when she noticed how weary he seemed.  The lines in his face had deepened in the last weeks and his step was not as quick.  He smiled wanly, seeming relieved to see her and asked "Is he back yet?"
<br><br>
Winter took a deep breath and let it out.  "No, not yet.  No word," she said quietly.
<br><br>
Ozymandius nodded solemnly.  "If anyone can find him, they can."  The wizard sighed and leaned against the railing, his head lowered in exhaustion.  "I had hoped he'd be back before I went to Felwithe."
<br><br>
"Why're you going there?"  Winter perched on the railing across from him and regarded him evenly, sitting atop the post on her heels.
<br><br>
The Erudite sighed.  "I must meet with the Keepers to make sure they are prepared for the coming of Vashaar."
<br><br>
Winter shivered involuntarily at the mention of the name, but shook it off.  "Who are the Keepers?"
<br><br>
"The Keepers of the Art are the three magic Guildmasters of Felwithe; Kinool Goldsinger the Enchanter, Niola Impholder the Magician, and Tarker Bladetoss the Wizard.  They wield the magic of all of Felwithe in their hands and must be prepared to deal with the Favoured One when he comes."  The wizard reached into his voluminous robes and pulled out a flask.  He lifted it to his lips and took swig from it, then grimaced and gasped a bit.  He then offered it to Winter, who declined, and he returned it to somewhere within his clothing.
<br><br>
"Do you think they will listen?"  Winter watched the wizard intently, seeing past the weak façade he put up, "he's worried," she thought to herself.
<br><br>
"I certainly hope so.  Without them and the Eldritch Collective of Ak'Anon, we have no hope at all."  Ozymandius stood and stretched, yawning as his body creaked and popped.  Then he straightened his robes and regarded Winter.  "I must be off."
<br><br>
He turned to walk away, then paused and looked back.  "They will find him."
<br><br>
Winter nodded mutely, then watched as Ozymandius turned and walked away.

"I shoulda been a farmer," whispered Cein the Rogue to himself for the dozenth time as he crawled on his belly through the crevice.
<br><br>
"You never hear of farmers having to wiggle into death traps to rescue friends.  Oh no, never risking their lives for no profits.  Mum always said 'Be a farmer, they have a good life' but did I listen?  No, of course not.  Bah"
<br><br>
The halfling continued his descent, wriggling through a crack only slightly narrower than his belly as he worked his way into the castle.  He paused, hearing something, and froze in place.  Several feet below him a Teir'dal strode past, clad in a chain hauberk and wielding a halberd.  The guard paused for a moment, glanced about, then continued his patrol.  Cein remained frozen, counting quietly to himself.  After twenty heartbeats, the Guard reappeared below, walking the other direction, and his footfalls faded in the distance.
<br><br>
Cein counted twenty more heartbeats, then continued his descent, careful and deliberate, though his mind wished him far away from here, screaming for a pub and a mug.
<br><br>
As he worked free of the crevice and glanced down, he saw the ledge that was his target a few feet below him.  Hooking his climbing rod into the crevice, he attached a rope and lowered himself to the ledge without disturbing so much as a single pebble.  Perched on the ledge, he made his way along the wall to the window and tried to open it… it was locked.
<br><br>
"Locked?" he thought to himself?  "What fool would break into a Vampire Lord's castle such that they felt they needed to lock the bloody windows?!"  Cein laughed to himself, then stopped when he realized he was a bit closer to hysteria than he preferred.
<br><br>
Cein slipped his tools from his belt pouch and unlocked the window.  Oiling the hinges, he opened the window carefully and moved into the room, gently pulling the window closed behind him.  Allowing his eyes to adjust to the candle lit room from the pitch night outside, he moved low to the carpeted floor and made his way to the door across the room.
<br><br>
The door was not locked, so Cein parted it a crack and peeked out down the hallway.  Slipping a mirror through the crack, he peeked up the hallway as well, making sure both ways were clear.  The halfling then pulled the door open more and slipped out into the hall, staying low to the ground as he moved down the hall.
<br><br>
Down the hall, around the corner, and down a staircase the rogue crept, his feet making no sound and his ears picking up every drop of water in the ancient castle.  As he moved into the lower catacombs, he heard the sound of slippered shoes on stone ahead of him.  He scurried up the wall and into the rafters of the hallway, his small body fitting neatly into the shadows.  Then, he began thinking like a wall.  He thought stable, protective thoughts, the slow moving thoughts of a wall.  
<br><br>
Beneath him a female Teir'dal walked.  She was clad in loose and revealing silken robes, her indigo skin shining in the candlelight and Cein's position offering him an excellent view down her décolletage.  He continued thinking wall thoughts, despite the distraction, as she stopped beneath him and glanced around, sniffing.  She turned about beneath him, as if searching for something intently, walking up and down the corridor.  Finally, she seemed to shrug and continue on down the hallway the direction she was heading.  Cein quietly sighed in relief, but in a very wall-like fashion, assuming walls can feel relief, which he thought they probably could.
<br><br>
After twenty heartbeats, then ten more for good measure, Cein lowered himself to the floor and continued his trek into the bowels of Castle Mistmoore.  Making his way through the mazelike corridors of the castle, he silently cursed the name of the wizard that asked him to do this.  "I swear, if it's the last thing I do, I will make Ozymandius pay for this" Cein grumbled to himself.
<br><br>
After almost an hour of searching, and three more guards avoided, Cein found the dungeons.  Dark, dank, and dismal, they stank of molding stone and rotting hay.  He crept through the hallway with locked doors along each wall, thinking rat thoughts to not be noticed and straining his ears to hear.
<br><br>
Hearing a shuffling in one cell, he stopped to investigate.  Scurrying up the door, he peered through the barred window into the tiny room beyond, but saw nothing.  "Great," he thought to himself.  "Let's open up a random cell in this wretched place and see what pops out.  I like this idea.  I really do.  Stupid dungeon, why don't they have nametags on the doors."
<br><br>
The rogue slid to the floor, took out his tools, and quietly picked the rusty lock.  Oiling the hinges as best as he could, he slipped the door open and peeked in.  Still seeing nothing, he opened the door wider (wincing as it creaked in protest) and slipped into the room.
<br><br>
Two steps into the room, something fell upon him from above, grabbing at him and forcing him to the ground.  His size and speed giving him a decided advantage, Cein scooted backwards beneath his assailant, slipping his stiletto from his sleeve and prepared to teach it the error of it's ways.  As his attacker turned to face him, Cein recognized him under the dirt and grime.  "Mac!"
<br><br>
Maclir was covered in dirt and blood, clutching an edged piece of stone in his hand as he crouched low and faced Cein.  At hearing his name, however, he paused and peered at the halfling.  "Cein?"
<br><br>
Cein nodded and dusted himself off.  "Mac, your accommodations are awful.  We need to find you a new place to hang out.  C'mon, let's get out of here."
<br><br>
The Ranger nodded and moved to the door.  Cein noted that, though Maclir had always been a bit on the "wild side", he seemed almost feral now.  The halfling pondered what they had done to him here, then shook off the thought… there were things he simply did not wish to know.
<br><br>
Cein slipped out the door and down the hallway, quickly and quietly, while Maclir followed.  The rogue whispered over his shoulder, "Getting out of here will be tricky, and we'll have to hurry.  If we get into a scrape, we do not stay to play but run like an scared gnoll."
<br><br>
Maclir nodded again, staying close behind the halfling and glancing about warily.  He clutched the sliver of stone in his hand, torn cloth wrapped around the base like a handle, and stayed crouched behind Cein, moving as silently as the rogue.
<br><br>
The pair rounded a corner and started up the stairs when a door opened and a guard stepped out.  The guard hadn't seen them yet, and Cein instinctively hopped sideways into a shadowed corner.  No sooner had he faded into the darkness than Maclir leapt upon the guard like a beast.  Before the guard could take in a breath to shout, his lifeblood was spilling out upon the floor, staining the flagstones crimson as Maclir crouched over him.
<br><br>
"Mac!" Cein whispered urgently.
<br><br>
Maclir turned to face the rogue, his eyes dark as onyx, then nodded and reluctantly left his prey.  The pair then ascended the steps quickly and quietly, alert for any further surprises.  Navigating the corridors from memory, Cein soon had them to the first room he entered in the castle.  Glancing out the window, he noticed a group of guards were outside, apparently searching for something.
<br><br>
Cein grumbled.  "Looks like it's time for plan B."  Maclir nodded mutely.
<br><br>
The rogue turned and exited the room, trying desperately to make up a plan B while Maclir followed.  They made their way through the twisting corridors, Cein periodically pausing to check a wall, his skill and experience showing him the false ones over the real ones, and soon they were walking down a well lit corridor with the smell of fresh air coming from ahead of them.
<br><br>
The hallway exited the castle several feet above the ground in the form of a bridge between the main castle and an isolated tower.  Cein glanced over the edge and realize he was right over where he needed to be.  As he turned to tell Maclir it was time to climb, a woman's voice interrupted them.
<br><br>
"You!"  Tisnya stood across the bridge, at the entrance to the tower, menacingly beautiful.  Maclir snarled at her, dropping to a low crouch and preparing to spring.  Cein, not wanting to deal with this, ended the engagement with the simple expediency of tackling Maclir and pushing both of them off the edge.  Maclir tried to struggle free, but years of falling had given Cein the edge such that they fell with Maclir on bottom, the Ranger breaking most of the rogues fall and knocking the wind and fight from him.  
<br><br>
A pair of large Troll hands picked the elf up and tossed him unceremoniously over a broad shoulder.  Tisnya sprung lightly from the bridge and landed on her feet, glaring at the Troll.  "Give him to me, ugly one."
<br><br>
"Me think not, dead lady.  You have other problems."  Trog smiled toothily, not a friendly expression even on his best days.
<br><br>
"Oh?  And what problem is that?" the vampire asked, taking a step towards the Troll threateningly.
<br><br>
"That would be me, actually," said a voice from behind her.  As she turned, the heel of a callused, bare foot slammed into her face, sending her reeling backwards.  The kick was followed by a series of rapid strikes as Kiro stepped into her, knocking her off balance.
<br><br>
Trog turned and set the unconscious Maclir on the ground, drew 8' of two-handed sword, and waded in to help his friend as the dwarven cleric behind him knelt to attend to the ranger.
<br><br>
"Dammit, Cein, you broke him!" Zemadek shook his head and begin to call upon his healing magics to mend the broken bones and wounds of the Ranger, the flickering lights of his spells moving about the elf's body and causing his wounds to disappear.
<br><br>
Cein chuckled.  "He'll live.  You know how stubborn he is, and I was NOT about to sit and debate with him."  The rogue drew his stilettos and maneuvered for a position behind the enraged vampire.
<br><br>
Despite their great skill, the battle was not going well.  Once she recovered from the initial attack, Tisnya lashed out with her vile incantations, evil tendrils of magic scarring the Monk's body as he tried to keep up the assault.  The vampire backhanded him, sending him tumbling, then she dodged the swinging sword from the Troll, turned and grabbed Cein, her icy touch chilling him to the bone.  She lifted the rogue effortlessly to her face, her fangs gleaming in the arcane light of her spells.
<br><br>
"Incoming!" shouted the gnomes Narrath and Gunther from across the tor.  Tisnya paused in her assault on Cein to look for who shouted and Cein took advantage of that opportunity to slip out of his oversized jerkin and fall to the ground.  As Tisnya turned on the gnomes, their incantations completed and lightning shot forth from their fingertips, blasting the vampire against the wall.
<br><br>
Kiro lifted himself to his feet and was stepping back into the fight when the sound of jingling armor alerted him to the presence of others.  Glancing down the tor, he noted a contingent of mailed guards advancing quickly.  "My friends, it seems our party is about to be crashed," he said calmly.
<br><br>
Tisnya, realizing she was outmatched, launched herself into the air and landed lightly on the bridge and retreated into her tower.
<br><br>
"Discretion, it seems, is the better part of valor," intoned Zemadek as he helped the groggy Maclir to his feet.
<br><br>
"Huh?" grunted Trog.
<br><br>
"He means we need to run away," chuckled Cein.
<br><br>
"Oh."  The Troll returned his sword to its scabbard and proceeded down the hill toward the forests of Lesser Faydark, his friends in quick pursuit.  Crashing through the thick foliage with the delicacy of an avalanche, Trog cleared the way to the forest path, then turned and trundled along it.
<br><br>
Maclir ran, with Zemadek's assistance, along with the gnomes while Kiro brought up the rear, casting looks over his shoulder periodically to make sure they were not being followed.  Together they made their way through the dense forest of Faydwer to Kelethin.
