If Taedar can tell his tale, then I should do no less ;)
<br><br>
As the first citizen of Norrath, my path has been filled with wonder and
excitement, peril and terror, passion and pain.  I have walked every step of
the lands, standing upon the very edge of reality and watch it unraveled
before me as new lands emerge.  And each new land, each new beast, each new
experience fills my heart anew.
<br><br>
When first I was borne into Norrath, I walked with the steps of a dwarf
named MacGregor, and I walked alone.  The gods flitted about on their
errands, creating and destroying as they saw fit, while I muddled my stout
way through the world.  Death found me quickly and often, as I rather
foolhardily attempted even the most obviously dangerous of tasks, pursuing
the stability of my new reality.  Once I had determined the extent of my
capabilities, I proceeded into the world to find it's limits.
<br><br>
In the beginning, the edge of the world was quite near and walking too close
to it was treacherous, so I spent most of my time getting killed by the
local fauna in varying ways, again seeking "holes" in my reality.  Most of
the holes I found, much to my chagrin, had teeth around them as I was eaten,
attacking creatures FAR beyond my capabilities.  The days of MacGregor were
filled with much mayhem.
<br><br>
Then, one sunny afternoon, an Avatar approached...Aradune Mithara.  "Make a
wizard and walk with me" he spoke.  Thus was born Ozymandius the Traveler.
Given the places that I would see, Aradune saw to it that I was properly
attired and skilled, then led me to the edge of reality, and beyond.  As
each new realm appeared, I would standing at the edge of it, anxious to step
upon it's soil.  The world was mine to explore, and explore it I did, with
the passion of a child given a new puzzle to solve.
<br><br>
As I traveled the world, gaining wisdom with each step, others came to me
seeking my advice.  I would Guide them along their paths, help them when
they were lost, and they would keep me company for awhile.  But in the end,
only Aradune could keep up.  He would arrive to invite me to a new place,
only to find me already there, wandering about in rapt fascination.  From
the tallest Giant-filled peaks to the deepest goblin infested depths, my
feet led me of their own accord, never resting in their search for new
places to tread.
<br><br>
Gods would summon me to do their bidding, asking of me advice or having us
inflict atrocities upon each other in the name of testing.  Many was the
"What if...?" question that lead to the death of one or both of us.
Aramith, another Avatar of Aradune Mithara, would invite me to travel into
the vilest dungeons with him, seeking out treasure and adventure.  He would
gleefully throw himself into the most violent of places while I stood back
to assist, then I would shake my head, collect his belongings, and make my
way out carefully to await his return.  I love him like a brother, but the
Aramith Avatar has not the common sense that Quellious gave the stones.
<br><br>
As time passed, more and more people appeared.  Slowly at first, trickling
in while the Gods worked to ensure the world would not unravel.  Then
quicker they came, when their caution seemed unfounded.  As these initiates
arrived, they also sought my wisdom, and thankfully it was given, for in all
my travels and all my exploring, the loneliness began to take its toll.
Many allies arose from these new ranks, including the young and impetuous
Taedar, the often dead.  I must publicly acknowledge Taedar in his ability
to die gruesomely, as it does surpass mine own and that of any other person
I've the pleasure of meeting, including Aramith himself.  
<br><br>
Others arrived, including my brothers of old.  With the arrival of my
brothers, the circle was complete.  A new world with old friends to explore
it with.
<br><br>
In all this, I have never faulted in my mission...to make the world the best
possible place for those that follow.  May you soon walk the lands that only
my feet have tread.
<br><br>
Yours,<br>
Ozymandius the Traveler, of The First Order
