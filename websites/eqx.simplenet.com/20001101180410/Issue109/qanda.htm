<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a creature or quest that raises my faction with merchants of Freeport? 
<br><br>
Rangar Fennin Ro
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought this would be an easy one to answer for you but sadly, as charming as you might try to be and as hard as you might fight to win a more favorable faction with the merchants of Freeport, it appears (from a consensus of the available Pillars of Wisdom) that there is no way to raise your faction there.  One guild friend did wonder aloud about a possible connection between the coalition of tradefolk and the merchants of Freeport, but it was a mere musing and although you might want to check it out, I have no knowledge that there is any connection.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question about Social Hot Keys.  I have been trying to make a social with more than two lines in it.  Something like Line1: /s Tag your It.Line2: /s Can't tag the butcher.  But when I run this hot key, it only is showing the first line. (I have checked both mine, and my roommates screens).  Is there anyway to get multiple lines in these hot keys to work?  Another question on the same topic...  Is it possible to ad a target to the phrase?  Eg) /s Tag you're it &lt;&lt;target&gt;&gt;translates into: Ranini says "Tag you're it Nepenthia"  
<br><br>
Ranini
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, I spent a considerable time last night near the orc lift in Kelethin, driving passersby and a very cute gnome "socials" partner crazy with my attempts to find some way to use the social keys as you have described.  As you discovered there is no way to set multiple lines and have more than one of them show up using /tell or /say.   There is also no way to wrap a long sentence to more than one line.  It's the Anti-Bard League at work again!  So to do as you would like, you have a couple of options.  If you are trying to use the multiple socials with someone not in /emote range,  you will have to do each phrase as a separate social and then set each social to a hot key.  When they are set, you simply click the hot keys in order as fast as you can.    Answering your second question, I could find no way to use target with a socials button except if you are using a pre-programmed emote.  In that case, if you target a player and hit a socials hotkey or button, it will name the player as part of the emote.  One thing to remember:  If you are within /emote distance, you can have each line of a social box with a separate emote and they WILL all show up to those around you. Thus you could type:  Line 1: /em hollers, "Tag you're It!"  followed by Line 2:  /em notes, "Can't tag the butcher" and put both phrases on one hotkey.   You can also use preprogrammed socials on hotkeys and set off 5 at once that way.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm wondering, I had heard of quests for mages that included actual armor pieces, not just the robe and boots and circlet, is this true?  If so, where might I go to find out what is involved?
<br><br>
Mindparadox Soulshadow
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a chance to chat with Veldra, a newly minted Pillar of Wisdom, and a level 50 Magician and ask for some hopeful news for you.  Alas, Veldra said that the quests are limited to the three items you mentioned plus a magical bracelet and that the rumors you heard were simply untrue.   Others have said that perhaps necromancers might have some leather armor hidden under their robes, but other than that, I think armor pieces are not something that you as a mage can quest for.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Umm. I don't mean to sound like a dumb newbie but... How do you obtain a last name or make your name like that, because when I was getting my name it didn't let me use spaces or anything of the sort.   Sincerely 
<br><br>
Paliin the Paladin
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What timing!  This past week a new naming policy was published on the EQ official website.  You should go there to read it in its entirety, but in the meantime I will pass along a quick answer from my reading of it and I'll paste in the part about last names.  First, to get a last name, you do have to be level 20.  You can then use the /surname command and give yourself a last name.  However, if you want two capital letters in your lastname or if you want an apostrophe, then you need to petition and ask for a Senior Guide or a GM to help you with your  name.  Last names have to meet the same naming rules as first names except that more than one player can have the same last name.  As you'll see below, last names cannot contain spaces nor can they make or imply titles.  I hope you do find a last name that suits you.
<br><br>
<em>(Copied and pasted from the official EQ Website)</em>
<br><br>
Surname Guidance:<br>
Surnames may not contain spaces <br>
Surnames may contain double capitals provided one of the divisions of the name is not a word, it does not create a title or a sentence, or breaks up a real word. <br>
Surnames may contain an accent ( ` ) provided one of the divisions of the name is not a word, it does not create a title or a sentence, or breaks up a real word. This accent is the only non-alpha character that is allowed in surnames.<br> 
Any number of players may have the same surname. Players wishing to use a surname that's rejected by the name filter as already in use do <b>not</b> need to seek out the original user of that surname to obtain permission.<br> 
<em>Surnames are protected by a Grandfather Clause: If a surname currently exists with spaces, double capitals, or accents, but does not violate the naming policy rules, they will remain unchanged.<br>
Note: Non-words like--D, Da, De, Di, El, Z, Za, Ze, Zi, L, Le, La, Li are unacceptable in cases where the name contains a normal word, as they are references to "The" and implicate a title, in both cases (e.g. D`Kval is acceptable where D`Basher is not).</em>

<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a quick question.  I must have missed something along the way. Where does the word "mob" come from? I mean, it's pretty obvious that it refers to creatures in EQ, but what does it mean? Is it short for "mobile thing which kills you"?   "Monster or Baddie"?
<br><br>
Fanedar,  Cleric Rodcet Nife
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "mob" is short for "mobile".  Tagad, that venerable and frequently-queried Pillar of Wisdom, tells me that the term was applied to moveable objects on muds, specifically on diku muds.  A mob is something that can move on its own and can attack in general.  EQ uses several terms in addition to mobs.  Sometimes players will just refer to all computer-generated figures as npc's or as monsters.   Myself, usually the term I use, while running as fast as I can is, "Oh no, there's an Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!"
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an ooc question and it is really simple.  Do I get any charge for creating a character on another server or is it free?
<br><br>
Rechoolet
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, here I get to extoll one of the blessings of EQ, which is, we can create as many characters on as many servers as are up and running as we wish and it's all for the same good cheap price.  Even a bard can afford it!  I know people who play on several servers just so they can play with different groups of friends so you should feel free to try out a new server anytime at no extra charge.   If you happen to pop onto Veeshan sometime and see me there, be sure to say hi!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My name may not be as long as "I hate my last name" as stated in Issue 108, but the name I sign every document with is actually my in-game name.  I still remember people saying they could tell I  sitting in a room running by  with my name jutting out of the woodwork. =) 
<br><br>
 Spellbounder Kapolo L'Arety
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing.  I've noticed long names disappearing too when dungeon rocks swallow up bits of alphabet only to spit them out again when the player gets up and moves.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another entry for your collection of long names, and this one should get a prize for being so silly - and no, I am not making this one up!  "Happypotatoe Thetatertot," whose server I will not name for fear of her name getting changed by a hard-nosed GM.  
<br><br>
Daeanor
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile, that is a very cute name.   However, even if a GM were as charmed by the name as I am, it looks like the new naming policy wouldn't allow for the name to remain so if anyone is considering emulating this kind of name, it probably wouldn't take root.   (Ok, sigh, obscure pun alert!) 
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Nep,  Just a quick something that I noticed the other day.  Holding "ctrl" while clicking a stack of inventory items selects just one of the item.  Here was I, doing the old combine items to boost skill thing, clicking on the stack, dragging the bar back to just one item, putting it into the kit, repeating for the rest of the items required, when all along I could have just ctrl-clicked to get just one.<br>
Why didn't I try this earlier?  Must be a Troll thing...
<br><br>
Grobalog
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my, you must be the genius of the troll race.  I immediately decided to try out your trick on my stack of meat pies and discovered that it works wonderfully.  Thanks for writing in.  You may have saved hundreds of people from additional carpal tunnel syndrome by your very helpful letter.
<br><br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mino horns are a wind instrument, as I used to play one m'self.   The lighter weight was an advantage, but they do not look as professional as a true flute, so I've gone back to the one my guild supplied =)  May your notes be as true as your heart,        
<br><br>
Evandril, Bard of the 23rd Song, Keepers of the Blood, E'Ci
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahhhh, finally an answer!  Thank you so much for writing in to let us know.   You may have saved the life of one nice bard, namely me, because now I don't have to go argue with some minotaur and brave his awful breath, just to get a horn to try out.  Thanks!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Personaldeodorant defeating Bodyodor...  I recall something like this happening once on the Rodcet Nife server (something like Packetloss defeating Eqcustomers in a duel to the death).  Well, after several duels, we were all quite pleased to see pop up, "VerantGM has defeated StupidNames in a duel to the death!" (obviously done by a GM, since the name included multiple capital letters).  Just thought I would pass this along...  
<br><br>

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh that's marvelous!  Thanks for sending it in and giving us a chuckle!  I guess none of us get to see the witty and humorous side of gm's very often and it's a delight when it shows through.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; About asking for a teleport, ress, other favors.  I like your answer Nep, only one problem:  It is too long if I am somewhere busy.  I might simply not have time to read it before it scrolls.  A simple "You available for a teleport?" usually works for me.   Most of the time I will reply with "Sorry busy", which means I am either in battle, or waiting for a fight/spawn.  If I am busy just reply with "ok" and chances are if you ever ask again and I am not busy I will do it.  People that start to whine will either go on my ignore list, and/or I let friends know and they will have a hard time getting anything from them.  :)  Yes I have done that before, not often though.  Have to give most people credit that they do understand if you are busy and take the first no for an answer.  The most problems I have are in areas like Greater Faydark and for some reason in my hometown of Felwithe.  Just because a person sits down inside a town does not mean they are not doing anything.  I do however announce where I am going if I have room for people before I leave.  And I never charge for a teleport if I am going that way.  Another way to also get more help is if you can contribute anything.  If you are an enchanter with clarity offer it, same with clerics, offer those buffs.  Even if you are lower level than the person giving the teleport (especially for wizards..) any buff is helpful.  Do remember that we get these requests all the time.  Do remember that most people will not go out of the way to do it.  Offer to come to where they are to get the teleport.  Chances are I am not going to teleport to you to pick you up.  If you need a ress try to have a way ready to get the cleric to and from where your corpse is.  Not all highlevels are familiar with all zones.   Hope that gives people some ideas.  There are some that will never help, some that go out of their way to help, some that will help when convenient (most of us I would think).

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks Ardel.  You're right about my /tell being pretty long but hey, some of my customers keep the wine flowing as long as I keep the words going.   If there were an etiquette doyenne of Norrath, I'm sure she would agree that the essential ingredient in asking for help is to remember the person  you are asking is in the game to play and have fun, may be in very dangerous circumstances or quite busy, and would appreciate patience, understand and appreciation. 
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you spend a minute and talk about GMs and Guides.  There seems to be a hierarchy, can you cover it ?  Also, what are they allowed and not allowed to do ?  Why are there more GM events on servers then others ?  Does that require some number of guides to make them happen ?  How do you see the role of guides on the servers as Verant would like to see it and how it really works in real life.  Thanks  -    
<br><br>

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa, I think this is something more up Abashi's alley but actually if you go the official EQ Website there is a really good explanation about guides and gms and what they can and cannot do.  Go to the main Everquest page and then under Support you can find a FAQ about them.  I did some checking in addition to reading the page and came up with some basic answers to your questions.  First, if you do a /who all gm on your server you may see both guides and GM's.  New guides are called apprentices and you can tell who they are by their title and the fact that they are level 20.  After the apprentices learn the ropes of guiding, they are made guides.  You can tell these guides again by their title and by the fact they are now level 50.  On each server, you will also see Senior Guides, still level 50, and lots of times you will be referred to one if you have a name problem or other special issues.   As Abashi said in his posts this past week and as the website says, all these guides are volunteers and don't work for Verant.   I try to be really nice to them and hope you will too.  Who knows when my mouldering corpse may need a magical tug out of the wall!
<br><br>
You will also see GM's on the /who all gm list.  I'm not so sure on this one but I think sometimes you'll see "GM Admin"  and occasionally "GM Lead Admin" or something like that.    These are the people who do work for Verant and who have primary responsibility for the servers.  If something really really goes wrong, like all of a sudden you are dead and no one, not even a guide can find your corpse or if the boats are smashing into each other at the docks like I have seen them do,  then the GM is called in and lots of times is able to help straighten out the problem.   Moving on to your questions about events, I have seen from the boards that there is a difference among servers as to events and quests but the GM-run events seem to be shrouded in secrecy so I'm not sure as to why.  You might want to ask a friendly guide or GM about it but my guess is the response you'd get would be a Mona Lisa smile and the advice to watch for strange or interesting things around you in the world.  Under "What Can A Guide Do For Me" on the EQ website, it does say that guides are involved in dynamic quests so my guess is that it takes a certain number of guides to be around to make an event or quest happen.  Your last question is beyond me.  I'm not sure how Verant sees guides except the website does say they are there to help everyone have a better time playing.  I know that guides have extricated me and my instruments from some very buggy situations and have always been kind and pleasant to me so I see them as a big plus and am grateful for their willingness to help.  As far as my own view of the guides, I think there is only one thing I would add if I could and that would be a way to have the guides help build communities on each server.  The mud I played on for a couple of years often had the "gods" walking among the players, joining in on some frivolities or discussing the religions of the land, etc.  I miss that chance to interact with players and "gods" (or "avatars" or "guides") in more of a community way.  I used to love it when one of the forgers of the mud I played would start a haiku contest on a quiet night or get some storytelling going over ooc.  It seems to me that those times were ways of building communities, sharing laughter and fun, and just hanging out when going out for a night of hack-and-slash was not appealing.   I hope as time goes on we won't just see player-run events -- which can be really fun -- but that we will see our guides get to know us as players and help us get to know each other.  So there's my two coppers on how I see the guide program.  What do you think?

Thanks all for writing in.  I'm so glad when you do and hope to hear from you soon!
