I have spent many days in the Spires of Innoruuk lately, but more in the Nektulos Forest, training my physical prowess.  My skills are advancing quite rapidly and I have even ventured into the nearby lands called the Commons.  I still hear the voices in my head but they are no longer as strong as they once were and they do not scare me anymore.  But something has taken their place.
<br><br>
Just after the Battle for the Book in Freeport, a monk named Amano Jyaku dueled one of the Blood Coven's sisters named Emerld Val'Sharess.  None know what has happened to her for she has disappeared just days after the duel.  But the monk has changed much.  He is no longer a force of good.  He brings pain and despair to all he can in the city of Freeport.  He has also been speaking in a strange tongue, one that none seem to know.
<br><br>
But I do.  It came to me one night in my sleep.  A saw histories long forgotten.  A time when the Teir'Dal were new.  A Great Deceiver was in their midst, his name was Thepa, a sibling of Innoruuk's.  The Deceiver took many of the Father's children and started his own offshoot called the Minions of Pain.  In the end, though, the Father returned His wayward children back into the fold and Thepa was defeated.
<br><br>
But now, the Deceiver has returned in the form of Amano Jyaku, the last of the Jyaku.  His power has been growing daily as he possesses more and more bodies.  His favorites are those that lived a life of good and he twists them to do evil.  The possessions are quite simple.  He or his minions corner a poor soul and when the body is beaten, he enthralls them.  Only those who have escaped with their life and were not defeated have escaped possession.  But as the Deceiver's numbers grow, the chances of winning dwindle more and more.
<br><br>
Recently, the daywalker who touched my mind, Ordieth Lightblade, did battle with Thepa's host.  He traveled to Freeport to free his friend and guildmate Kamas from the Deceiver's thrall.  In the end, Ordieth defeated them both.  Weary, he grabbed Kamas and ran into the Commons.  There, he found me.
<br><br>
Since my first memories, Ordieth has told me that I am unlike all Teir'Dal.  He has told me that I shall bring about a great change in Norrath someday.  I ask him if he too believes that I am the Daughter of Innoruuk but he is unsure.  I am unsure what to think of him.  He professes to keep me safe from harm at all cost… yet at the same time, he was present when my mother was slain and I was stolen from her.
<br><br>
I hear word that my mother has returned from the dead, although these details are sketchy at best.  But I have yet to hear from her.  Perhaps she is ashamed of me.
<br><br>
I warned Ordieth to tie his friend up and return him to his lands.  He was not to untie him for many days, for Thepa feeds upon pain.  If a host is not feeling any pain for a long period of time, he would release him and possess a more suitable body.
<br><br>
'Twas the next day, after the daywalker had done battle with Thepa and was victorious... to a degree. I fear he is blinded by his own... self righteousness, though. I warned him that Thepa's will is not easily broken and that his friend is still in danger unless he is kept in bondage away from all harm and surrounded by things he loved. Instead, though, Kamas walks freely. I believe it shall not be long before he is returned to the Deceiver's fold. 
<br><br>
After killing a few foolish skeletons that attacked me, and collecting their remains, I began walking around... my head full of thoughts and confusion. Before I knew it, I was in the Commonlands. No one bothered me as I walked about lost in my own thoughts. Why has Thepa returned? What does he want? What does the Father want me to do? Why did my mother truly forsake me?
<br><br>
But as I continued my trek through the lands, a human stood before me.
<br><br>
"Stop there vile beast," he said to me.
<br><br>
At first, I just looked around, wondering who he was talking to. Then I noticed it was I he meant.
<br><br>
"I mean you no harm," I said. "I just wish to be left alone."
<br><br>
"I shall not let you stain my lands with your foul essence." The human withdraws his weapon, a mighty two-handed sword.
<br><br>
"Sir, I am sincere when I say I mean you no harm. I have not come here to fight... or to train. I just am deep in thought and wish to continue with my thoughts. If it bothers you, I shall return to Neriak now." I said. I did not have time for such foolishness and this human never did me any harm.
<br><br>
"Aye, you shall return to Neriak indeed, but in pieces, not peace!" he shouts as he rushes towards me, his weapon held high.
<br><br>
Quickly, I mutter the words and feel the power as a flash of light erupts before his eyes. Then, the power of the furor shoots forth, knocking the warrior back. After that is done, I turn around and begin walking back towards Neriak. I feel my message was left with him. I would not kill him, but I would not let him harm me either.
<br><br>
A short distance later, I hear a battle cry again. I turn just in time to see the very same warrior attacking me, but this time he had an axe and a shield on. His shield bashed me in the face, knocking me to the ground. He follows up with a downward slash, trying to thrust his axe into my gut. But I am quick and roll out of the way.
<br><br>
As he turns to face me again, I let loose another barrage of energy that smacks him back, giving me time to get to my feet.
<br><br>
<em>"All I wanted was to be left alone!"</em> I think to myself.  <em>"All I wanted was... peace. But it is not to be!"</em> My body comes aglow with dark powers, my blood surging with them. <em>"Yessss, I can feel it! Pure, seething hatred. No escaping it! Just embrace it."</em>
<br><br>
"Yesss, let the bloodlust wash over me! Just give in to what I truly am -- the Final Embrace -- Death!"
<br><br>
Quickly, I dispatch my magic upon this fool, the furor striking him again and again. He was almost dead, but I ran out of power. I grabbed my staff and met his weapons with my own. It wasn't really a contest, though. He was sorely beaten already with my magiks alone. Finally, the human warrior fell before me.
<br><br>
Dead.
<br><br>
I walk away, blood upon my weapon and hands.  This is the first person I have ever killed. I have trained against beasts and the undead... but this is the first... person I have every slain. I tell myself it was in self-defense but... at the end, I could have walked off. I could have spared his life. But I knew if I did, he would just be upon me again. If not today, then tomorrow.
<br><br>
I start my trek back for Neriak.  I have learned one of the lessons of my Father.  But it was not He who taught it to me.  Nor was it my people.  Nay, it was the humans who did.  They taught me hatred.
