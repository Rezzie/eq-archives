The pounding of his heart echoed the pounding of his feet in the gloom-filled
tunnels. Arthedain raced down the corridor and turned into a large cavern.  His
entire party had been wiped out by Gnolls, and now they were chasing him through

Gnoll or pair of Gnolls and quickly dispatching them.

All he carried now was his sword and shield, and he was beginning to have second

mage showed that this lair had been abandoned for years, but had once held a band of
orcs.  The party had gambled that this band was part of an army that got wiped out in
a battle with dwarves a century ago, and that their lair would be abandoned, perhaps
containing the spoils of war.
