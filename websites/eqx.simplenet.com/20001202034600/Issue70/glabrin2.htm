	It was a warm spring day, and I was daydreaming by the main lake in Felwithe.  Actually I was supposed to be studying, but instead I was trying to figure out where the large bass that I had almost caught yesterday might be hiding.  It was fairly warm, so he might be under the bridge. But on second thought, he could be deep in the middle of the lake. I had just about decided that I could forget about the rest of the days studies, when I heard a voice from over the wall.
<br><br>
"Glabrin," whispered the voice, "Is that you in there?"
<br><br>
As I looked toward the wall where the voice had come from, I saw a pair of hands tackling the wall.  I then saw a pair or familiar mischievous eyes looking over the wall.
<br><br>
"Breandor, is that you?" I asked, knowing full well that it was. "What are you doing here? You know we will both get in trouble if you get caught around here."
<br><br>
"Ha, get caught . . . No way," answered Breandor. " I have come to liberate you from this boring place.  It is too wonderful a day to be locked in here studying. Come with me, I have an errand to run that might be interesting."
<br><br>
Now, in case you don't know, interesting has somewhat of a different meaning when Breandor mentions it.  His idea of interesting would scare the skin off most people.
<br><br>
I looked at Breandor carefully trying to figure out what he had in mind.
<br><br>
"You know Breandor," I said, "I really should stay here studying. After all how will I ever become powerful enough to roam the lands and explore, if I don't learn how to protect myself."
<br><br>
I made a show of sitting down to study when he said the words that hooked me like a fish.
<br><br>
"I have been asked by Sayer Crimp to deliver a message to the dwarven merchants that run the shops at the crossroads . . . in the Butcher Block Mountains.  Are you sure you don't want to go?" asked Breandor as he smiled smugly.
<br><br>
I had been talking about the Butcher Block mountains since before I met Breandor.  I had heard stories of mighty birds that walked upright, of huge bugs that could snap a person in two, of huge ogres that hit with the power of a giant. Breandor knew all this, and knew that my insatiable hunger for knowledge would leave me with no choice but to accompany him. It really was not fair.
<br><br>
"Well . . ." I said to Breandor, "I guess there will be plenty of time for studying later, and I have been studying for a long time today.  In addition Butcher Block is a dangerous area.  I really couldn't live with myself knowing that you might be eaten by some gruesome beast. So, I guess I could go."  With that statement I leaped to my feet and over the wall, ready for the unknown.
<br><br>
Breandor laughed at my enthusiasm, and we started off.  Most of the area we traveled through I knew from our many adventures together, but soon we left familiar ground.  We traveled through the great stone monoliths that powerful mages use to travel the lands. Up and down the hills we went until we finally arrived at a pass in the mountains.
<br><br>
"Here we are," announced Breandor "the pass between Greater Faydark and the Butcher Block Mountains. We must be careful from here on out, let's walk quietly and carefully."  Breandor looked at me and smiled, for he knew that asking me to move quietly anywhere was like asking an Orc to have table manners.  To a Ranger, moving silently was a natural thing.  I am sure I sounded like a herd of Mammoths when I walked.
<br><br>
We walked through the pass and down onto the grassy slopes of the foothills of the Butcher Block Mountains. There is very little I can do to describe the beauty that I saw there.  The majestic mountains towering above, the beautiful sky. My breath was taken away by the majesty of it all.
<br><br>
And then I saw the creatures that roamed this land.  I cowered down as a monstrous beetle strode past our hiding spot.  This creature was as tall as I was, and I could almost feel the ground shake as it passed us.  I looked down the hill and discovered the largest skunk I had ever seen, regarding us with uncertainty.  We slowly back away from the beast, for no one wishes to deal with that smell, and started down the main path toward our destination.  Breandor assured me that we had not far to go. Ahead I noticed another beast approaching us.  It was taller then I was and walked with a purposeful gait past us.  I gasped in wonder at the beauty of this bird-like creature.  I had heard the stories of the regal air that the Crag Aviaks have about them, but the beauty of this bird far surpassed any stories I had been told.  The bird paid us no attention and passed us by.  
<br><br>
"Ahh," breathed Breandor, "There is our destination.  I have to deliver this message to the merchants in the shop ahead."
<br><br>
" Wait!  Over here, get down!" Breandor shouted at me.
<br><br>
I wondered what had gotten him so excited, as I followed him off the road and crouched by a tree with him.  I then saw what Breandor was wary about.  At first I thought it was a normal Orc Centurion, the kind that are found throughout Greater Faydark.  But then I noticed that this one was a bit different.  He wasn't as large as a Legionnaire, but he had an aura of power about him that made me feel that he would be as dangerous as a Legionnaire. He was also extremely fast and his leg muscles rippled as he ran down the path.
<br><br>
"Orc Runner," whispered Breandor to me, "They travel this road a lot. It's a good thing he did not see us, for we would have been hard pressed to escape."
<br><br>
We continued on to the shops and Breandor delivered his message.  We were feeling quite confident and pleased with ourselves as we started back toward the pass.  I must say that I was thinking that this traveling and exploring thing wasn't nearly as dangerous as I had been told. As we traveled along the trail, Breandor suddenly stopped.  He looked around puzzled, as if something was bothering him.  I heard a strange mumbling noise behind me and turned, and saw a green creature approaching me, the source of the mumbling. This was a Goblin, one of the foulest creatures in the land. They are ugly, almost as smelly as Orcs, and have been rumored to eat their own young. I turned to run, and noticed Breandor doing the same. All of the sudden a bright blue light erupted from the Goblins hands.  I was amazed that something like a Goblin could cast spells, and then I found myself with no control over my bodily functions.
<br><br>
It was a strange feeling, almost as if I were watching a play.  I felt myself reach down and grab my staff.  I watched in horror as I raised my staff and brought it down with full force, on Breandors head!  Breandor turned and saw that it was I attacking him.  I saw his face turn from surprise to confusion as I swung again and connected a violent blow to his shoulder.
<br><br>
"Glabrin!" Breandor shouted at me, "What are you doing!"
<br><br>
Of course I could not answer, even though I wanted to tell him what was happening.  As my next blow descended, Breandor pulled out his sword and blocked it.  I swung again, and again it was blocked by Breandor"
<br><br>
"Glabrin.. I warn you. We are friends but if you continue to attack me, I will consider this friendship over and defend myself, "declared Breandor.
<br><br>
I cried to Breandor within my head that I am your friend, I cannot help myself, but of course Breandor never heard my cry.  I attacked Breandor anew, and connected with my staff again.  I saw a look anger cross his face, and this time he attacked aggressively. I had little chance against a trained warrior in a hand to hand fight, and Breandor soon scored many hits upon me.  I began to weaken, and yet I still could not stop myself from attacking. I raised my staff for another blow and I saw a look of victory on Breandor's face.  He took the opening that I had given him and shoved his sword deep within my belly.  I felt the fire of agony burn through me, as I dropped to the ground.  I looked up and met Breandor's gaze and saw the understanding of what he had done, impact upon his face.
<br><br>
"Why did you do this Glabrin?" questioned Breandor, "We were friends, why did you make me kill you?" 
<br><br>
I watched as Breandor dropped to his knees, grief apparent upon his face.  I wished that I could say something to comfort him, to tell him that I understood. But all I wanted to do was sleep, I laid my head on the ground and closed my eyes and hoped that Solusek Ro, would be merciful. 
<br><br>
 As I started to drift away I heard a voice.
<br><br>
"Lo. What has happened here?" said a voice filled with sorrow.
<br><br>
I drifted away . . . 
<br><br>
The next thing I remembered was the same voice I heard earlier.
<br><br>
"Ok," said he voice "That should do it."
<br><br>
I thought to myself that this must be it.  Solusek Ro was here to judge me.  I was determined that he would find me worthy.  He would not find a weak creature here.
<br><br>
I leaped to my feet and announced, "Solusek Ro, you will find me ready to fight, you will not take me easily"
<br><br>
I opened my eyes to see . . . 
<br><br>
Breandor and a strange dwarf regarding me with bemusement.
<br><br>
"Ahh lad," chuckled the dwarf, "I can see you are ready to fight.  I hate to disappoint you, but I am not Solusek Ro.  You will not be meeting him tonight. "
<br><br>
"Thanks to Naroon," interjected Breandor.  "He came across us just as you were almost dead Glabrin.  He healed you then explained to me what had happened.  That Goblin we saw was a Shaman, and he cast a spell on you that put you under his control.  I am so sorry that I retaliated against you Glabrin, but I didn't know what was happening.  Naroon killed the shaman and then healed you."
<br><br>
I looked down at the smiling Dwarf and extended my hand.
<br><br>
"Good Naroon," I said,  "I am in your debt and, I thank you for your timely arrival"
<br><br>
Noon accepted my handshake and said, "There lad, tis no problem.  I am a healer, by the grace of my god, and the Goblins are an evil race.  Actually it is by no mistake that I travel this way.  The message that young Breandor here delivered was for me, asking for my help with a strange sickness that some of the Wood-Elves have come down with.  If you would like the company, I can travel back with you."
<br><br>
"We would love the company," exclaimed Breandor, "If you are ready Glabrin we should probably get you back to the city. I am sure your father will be looking for you."
<br><br>
As I looked up in the sky, I noticed how low the sun hung in the sky. I quickly calculated how long it would take to get home, and let out a sorrowful yelp. My pain for the day was not yet complete, my father would make sure of that.
<br><br>
As I turned to run to the pass, I looked back and yelled, "What are you waiting for, a written invitation!"
<br><br>
Our trip back to my home was uneventful, thankfully, and I will not mention the conversation that I had with my father.  Let's just say that I came to enjoy looking at the walls of my room for many days afterwards.  One thing I decided on that day.  If the beauty and wonder of Butcher Block are any indication of what is out there in the rest of the world, then I need to concentrate harder on my studies.  For the world of Norrath is a large place, and I will be prepared, because I want to see it all.  
<br><br>
Of course I do still need to catch that bass.
<br><br>
...I wonder where he is hiding today...
