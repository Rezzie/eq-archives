"Wow.  Well speed is not a problem with me.  I want fast!"  I say, letting him think his plan of sucking me in was working. "Also I was told to get lots of memory for program storage."
<br><br>
"This computer stores up to four gigabytes of information." He says.

<br><br>
"Now you'll need to buy a modem to connect to the Internet."
<br><br>
"It doesn't already have one?"
