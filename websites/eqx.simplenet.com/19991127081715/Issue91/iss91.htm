	Gorch lumbered through the Faydark, his feet crushing the underbrush on either side of the path, which was made for much smaller feet.  Draped over his shoulder was the unconscious Drock, who he held in place with one hand.  His mismatched armor shone in the early morning light, and around him birds chirped.  Song birds where unheard of in the Innonthule swamps and to finally hear them added a spring to his massive steps.  Behind him the trio of elves followed warily.  Their feet never left the seldom-used path and they made no noise, marking them as experienced woodsmen.  Lillyana watched Gorch carefully. His sudden rescue and willingness to help were extremely out of character for a troll.  However, he did seem genuinely concerned about the dwarf he carried.  Lillyana chuckled at the thought of what Drock would say when he was told he was carried to Kelethin on the back of a troll.  Gorch looked back over his shoulder inquisitively.

<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="-1">
Every online game that I've played in or worked for has had people who try to cheat, or beat the game. Incidents in Everquest are different in a few ways.
<br><br>
1) EQ is much more complex than an old-style MUD.  The more lines of code you have, the more chance that bugs crop up.<br>
2) EQ is much more populated than MUD-style RPGs.  The GM-player ratio in Everquest is really poor.  It is much easier for people to get away with things in the mass of players.  Also, MUD admins were usually friendly with and respected by their players.  It is easier to rationalize cheating against a company that you hate than a friend.

To understand this story, and any others that may follow, you need to know a little about me and about the land. Otherwise, this story will sound like a piece of junk and will be burned ( magic users) ripped apart (fighters) or eaten (Ogres and trolls, though I'm sure some halflings could do this too) by you, the reader.

Whew.  I got a lot of mail on that last editorial.  I forgot how much mail a strongly worded opinion can generate, especially when it's about a topic that generates emotion as strongly as the term 'twink'.  I want to thank everyone that wrote in, even if you hated what I wrote.  I really do want to hear all the opinions on things.  But this week I think I'll talk about something less likely to stuff my mailbox.

I have ahd a problem with a repeatable crash bug in EQ and the only
response to the ten communications (in game and E-mail) has been "don't
use those keys."
<br><br>
While I try not to, and the combination is not a common one, it still
seems to me that a programmer ought to take a different attitude to a
repeatable crash bug.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello all I have question for you. I am a Bard and would like to know why I am auto-targeted when grouped as some party members find this a little annoying. Also I was wondering why Bards can't use bow's and Paladins can<b>...</b>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings!  Probably a question that's been answered before -- how do I check to see how my skills are progressing numerically -- I look at the skills chart in my persona regularly, and see feeble, below average, etc. -- is there a way to see the numbers except for when they advance?
<br>
Thanks! Caileb (Karana)
