	This past week I went to Chicago to visit my family and watch a Bears game.  I took my step-daughter, and we had a great time, even though the Bears lost.  I've been thinking lately about why I like EQ so much, and the game sort of brought up a point.
<br><br>
Many of the games we play, console games like Playstation and Nintendo, and computer games, are played alone.  Like watching a football game, we sit in the room, glued to the screen and watch all the action.  If something exciting happens, or something scary, we jump up and yell, but there is no one there sharing it with us.
<br><br>
In a stadium, when the Bears picked up a fumble, there were 50,000 other people yelling and cheering.   In the tense times when the opposing offense was near our end zones, the stadium noise rose to a roar to try to make the offense make a mistake.  Though I was sitting next to only one person I knew, I felt an awesome kinship with everyone else in the stadium.
<br><br>
Norrath is like this too.  While there are very few people we really "know" in Norrath, there is a kinship that all of us are sharing.  We are all trying to unlock Norrath's mysteries, whether by solving a difficult quest, or by finding better equipment to give us that edge over our opponents, or buying a spell to increase our effectiveness.  We also share by interacting, telling stories of victories, fighting together against a common foe, or laughing at some out of character comment someone made.  Like at the football game, I'd yell "Nice pass!" And people next to me will look over and nod and we'll give each other a high five.  GO BEARS!
<br><br>
It's this kinship that can make for instant groups, too.  I have had my share of bad parties, but just today I hooked up with two complete strangers and we rocked the place.  Warrior, bard, and druid, we all knew our roles and executed them, taking on a steady diet of reds and never dying.  Amazing fights, stressed to the limits, the bard chaining two and three songs together to save us, switching instruments and weapons, the druid buffing and using area spells to drop down opponents that swarmed us.  We didn't yell at him for stepping out of the fight to cast spells, it was his job to cast the spells, and we couldn't afford the monsters turning on him and disrupting spells.  We *knew*  what to do and when to do it, though we'd never played together before then. GO GROUP!
<br><br>
Norrath has it's beer spilling drunks, too.  (No, not the dwarves or barbarians either.)  Kill stealers, campers, rude people - they are all out there - but they do not take away too much from what I do to have fun.  There is always another seat in the stadium to watch the game from, and I'd rather spend my time playing than complaining.
<br><br>
I'm still pleased and excited to play EverQuest, 15 months and counting.
