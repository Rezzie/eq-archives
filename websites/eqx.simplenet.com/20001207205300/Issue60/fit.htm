FREEPORT:
<br><br>
Laevra Starleaf was assassinated in her room at the Freeport Inn
last night. Laevra, a noted Magician and leading supporter of the Elven
Crusade, a proposed war to destroy the Dark Elves, was in Freeport trying
to get support from the local government. Details are sketchy at this time,
but eyewitness reports say that a dark figure was seen leaving the back
ally of the Inn near the time of the incident. 
<br><br>
The Freeport Milita, first on the scene, reported finding nothing but a
dagger of Dark Elven make. It was plain except of the addition of two
glyphs on the pommel. Experts conclude that the Glyphs are Dark Elven, One
For Evil or Harm, and the Other one for Blossom or Flower. With no other
leads, the Freeport Militia are offering a reward of 5 Plat. for
information leading to the execution of the person or persons responsible.
