Once you select your desired class, you get a number of points to beef up 
your default stats.  Stats are typically in the 50 (very low) to 120 (very 
high) range, and wont be easy to increase.  Then you get to chose a deity, 
which is restricted by your class (and maybe race).  Finally, you chose the 
city you want to call home, depending on your race.

As we've all seen in the screenshots, different characters are different
heights.  This means any humans or larger wont even see a gnome standing
at their feet.  I was told that one of the testers likes to play a gnome 
and you won't even see him, so he has to jump.  You'd just see his head
pop up and down at the bottom of your screen.

As a newbie, you will find it difficult to kill anything, unless you have
help or are a barbarian warrior.  Teaming up from day one will be a necessity.
In fact, you may need help just finding your way around the city.  Qeynos and
Erudin are the only cities in the game so far, so most characters start in
Qeynos by default.  The city itself consists of multiple zones, so it is
fairly large.  Another reason to team up is if you die, you will have a hard
time finding your corpse again.  If you are in a party, you can give your
party members permission to pick equipment off your corpse, and then you 
can meet up to get your stuff back.  As a non-PvP, no one else can touch your
stuff, so you'll have to find your corpse on your own!  Of course, if you are
a necromancer, you may be able to utilize a Locate Corpse skill to help your
search.

<b> As a Newbie </b>
<br><br>

I didn't get much of a chance to wander too far, since as a newbie you wont
stray far from town anyway.  But in my travels, I saw a beautiful clock tower
in Qeynos that emits a reddish glow, which is screenshot material at night.
Outside the city, they have populated it with lots of bats, snakes, and an
occasional fire beetle.  Once, strolling down the road out of Qeynos, I 
witnessed an epic battle of 4 partied warriors killing a large group of
various monsters.  This alone wasn't too unusual, but as I gazed upward into
the rolling sky, I saw a character standing fifty feet in the air.  Whether
this was a bug, or a flight or levitation spell I don't know, but it was awe
inspiring nonetheless.
