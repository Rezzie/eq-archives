Once upon a time I was the average male text "Mudder". I logged onto my favorite mud daily, power leveled because it was a competition not a game, and did not think of bringing my years and years of role-playing experience to the game. Then Meridian 59 came along, and I came up with some strange hybrid of role-playing. At first I just started with a main character that was really just me, and no role at all<b>...</b>

Anthiel ran, his lungs laboring, his heart pounding, his muscles aching with fatigue and fear.  He could hear Freygar's heavy footfalls behind him, and the snarls of the Gnolls.  The tunnel curved ever upward, and then, ahead, he could see the door, white daylight seeping under the lintel.

<center><big><b>Can Role-Playing be Defined?</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
Role-playing.  Roleplaying.  Role Playing.  What the heck is 'Role-playing' anyhow?  Well, I think there is a way to define this; and its not the nebulous, un-definable thing that most people make it out to be IMO.  I think it has, just like any other word, a mostly true definition.  Sure, maybe not exact by everyone's standards but definitely something you can contain in a few sentences or so. So, I'm going to try to do that (and spend more than a few sentences backing up my claim....)

<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
The caverns of Kaladim arch over the town like a dark, cozy embrace.  Elves and other outdoor races claim to feel enclosed, but the ceilings are so high they might as well be the limitless sky.  Firmly seated in the Butcherblock mountains, Kaladim is like the race it houses: strong, solid, and implacable.  I only wish that my race was a little less implacable when it came to dealing with other races.  Sometimes, I think, we are a bit too proud of our accomplishments, and too bitter about our reverses.

"Keep it.  I've got more important things to worry about," said Shandar.
<br><br>
Little did he know just how true that statement would prove in just a little while.  He stumbled out of the tavern and into the streets.  The liquor had worn off some, but only a little.  Then he began to sing a sad song, if you could truly call it singing.  It was a song that Shandar had learned from an old dwarf, and Shandar's voice simply didn't do the song justice.  It just wasn't deep enough, and Shandar's inebriated state didn't help matters any.  Nonetheless, the song did always make Shandar feel better, and by the gods, Shandar needed to feel better tonight if any night.

Never underestimate the power of an article's title to grab your attention.  I want to discuss the practice known as "camping" in EverQuest.

First the bad news: At some time during your online life in EQ you will find yourself doing it.  That's right, even folks such as me who hate the idea of sitting around waiting for something to respawn will indeed find themselves parked within sight of a spot known to be frequented by some nasty that is just the right size for me to handle.

I have, of course, received a bit of mail as the result of my last editorial.  I really hate rehashing last weeks editorial, especially when that means that I have to re-read it myself.  So I'm not going to spend any time justifying my reasons for disliking certain names.  As someone pointed out, you either see it right off, or you don't.

I was disappointed to read that Absor mentioned us in his article about Guild
Names.  He effectively made a mockery of our guild name with obviously little or
no real information on us.  He is right, our guild made a name to attempt to
preserve our Tanarus name MOB<b>...</b>

<em>Dear Expressions,
<br><br>
I recently married, in a mud ceremony online, and got married to a woman I had met last year online.  We really hit it off from the start, and have been together since.  My problem is I feel guilty as hell because in real life I'm married!  What should I do?
