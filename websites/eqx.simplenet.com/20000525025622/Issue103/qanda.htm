<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question dealing with the Everquest personal transport system or whatever you want to call it.  I heard that they would implement horses or beasts for people to ride for better transportation.  Have you heard any other news about when they would put this in or how it would work?  Thanks!! 
<br>
Barok
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;From everything I can remember reading about transport in Norrath, I don't believe there are any plans to introduce horses or other beasts for people to ride.  As much as I would love to ride a shining white horse through the world, it would be a pity to subject it to such vile places as Kithicor Forest, so in a way I'm glad we will have to rely on our feet and spells for travel across land.  However, recently, I was given the gift of Mistmoore Battle Drums and my speed song for my groups just got a lot speedier.  So don't lament the lack of horses, seek out some charming bards who will sing you along the path as you enjoy the splendid scenery.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;One question about the PvP servers that has me scratching my head. Now we've all taken that long boat ride from Butcherblock to Freeport and back. When you are on the boat, you are very limited as to what you can do. No Fishing. No Spell Casting. About the only thing you *can* do is practice languages and get drunk.  So, on the PvP servers, it seems like even the weakest of Warriors would be able to bash the heck out of all the Spellcasters on the boat, who would be unable to fight back due to the restriction on casting spells.  So, what do casters do when traveling on PvP servers? Group with melee classes for protection while on the boat?  Thanks,
<br>
Sylven
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your question aroused a great curiosity in me too.  It seems like it would be so unfair to allow an enormous barbarian warrior to flail away on a tiny gnome enchanter with no consequences at all.  I had almost gotten my courage up enough to risk death by going to Rallos Zek to seek an answer to your question, when I ran into two very shy friends of mine, one of whom threatened to disappear the instant I asked if I could inquire about this matter.  They did tease me about being my Pillars of Misinformation, but I am relying on their answers as both agreed that, in fact, there can be no combat between pc's on the boats.  Now if that darn shark would just agree to swim to Erudin instead of flying in to take over the helm by eating all the passengers, complete respite from battle while on the boats could nearly be assured.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail and well met!  My question involves another very questionable topic of the Level 3 song Jig-O' Vig.  There are some people who believe that this song regens mana at a very small level even though our Clarity song is at L 32.  I have personally tested this song with many a mage and after close inspection (and a timer) they said that the song does NOT regen mana of any kind. The L 3 song is a STA regen song which has nothing to do with mana recovery.  Please settle this bardic debate once and for all.  My salutations. 
<br>
Cymis Stormsong
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I did some research on this matter and saw exactly what you meant when you described the bardic debate.  In fact, I couldn't find anyone who seemed to agree with anyone else and unfortunately, didn't happen to cross paths with the Arch-Mage himself so I could ask.  One site claims as much as a 20% increase in mana regeneration with the vig song even at low levels.   However, I must admit that I doubt this as no caster in my party has ever seemed to regen mana faster at all.   However, should the ArchMage come forward and say I am wrong, then I will simply smile sweetly and claim there must have been no mana regeneration simply because I was singing in the wrong key.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering why there weren't any chickens or  why chicken is not available to buy in the market place to use for cooking. We could use good chicken soup on a cold day in Halas.
<br>
Barnes [Raptors]
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't all that long ago -- a few months perhaps -- when someone else suggested the very same culinary treat be added to Norrath and also suggested adding a charge of healing to the chicken soup.  Lonely Halas could become the soup capital of the world with a little work on the chefs and their recipes there.  I can see it now, instead of the dry dusty plazas of Freeport, the trade of the realms could be carried on in the chill air of Halas as the players bargain over their steaming mugs of soup!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are there no answers and only questions in the Question AND ANSWERS section? 
<br>
Siladin
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit I was totally puzzled by your question.  I mean, after all, I sit down every week after wearing my tiny feet into blistered masses travelling hither and yon trying to answer these questions with at least some semblanceof accuracy.   However, a blinding insight hit me!  After all, when anyone looks at the question and answer column on the main sheet of EQ Express, there are only questions.   Notice, though, that there is a link on the left below those questions (not the Nepenthia link on the right which just gives you a list of what I have written but the other one).   So click on that link, and that should take you to an entirely new page filled with both the questions and answers.  I hope it works for you and that you enjoy what you find there.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Neppy, Me ask queeston dat evy un else be askin' only differnt. Whos ya tink am cutea' trollies or ogreses? Me tinks ogreses. Trollies nut as pertty as us ogreses.'ave an dood day! 
<br>
Okk
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my goodness Okk, I am sure you are the darlingest ogre to ever tromp the swamps of Innothule.  However, sadly  enough, my Pillars of Wisdom inform me that in their humble opinions, trolls are cuter.  I will try to write the reason simply so as not to burden your vocabulary.  What I was told was that trolls are much the cutest because of their ears!  If you paint them all white (and chisel the moles off their beaks a bit) they look like giant bunny rabbits.   I don't want to hurt your feelings after you took what must have been a very long time in order to write your letter to me, so I will let you in on a little secret!  I think ogres are very cute and definitely cuddlier than trolls.  Plus, some of them are excellent dancers and great fun to chat away an evening with.  So take heart, even if my Pillars of Wisdom are factually correct, you and I both appreciate the perttines of ogres.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I just started playing Everquest 5 months ago and had the 3 month account plan.  It expired 2 months ago and I haven't renewed it since.  If I renew it now, will I get my old characters back? 
<br>
Morvan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can check on this by calling the Station about your account, but the website says that if you cancel and resubscribe within a 6 month period, your will still have access to all your game characters.  Welcome back, by the way, -- you'll find some pretty cool new things I think!  And of course, you'll find that bards still retain both their music and their charm to make life in Norrath more pleasant for all its citizens.  (Well except for the inhabitants who consider all the bardic people as little more than tasty morsels.!)
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, good Nep!  I play a Shadowknight on the Fennin Ro server, who worships Bertoxxulous in the shrine of Qeynos.  One day my guildmasters quit training me for reasons unknown to me so now I must train in the good town of Freeport.   My question is , if I am one day able to participate in a battle against Innoruuk and we are victorious, will I take a faction hit against the Freeport shadowknight guildmasters who serve the god of hate? Will they also no longer train me thereby practically leaving me nowhere to advance my skills? 
<br>
Sadon Darkfall, 22 Human Shadowknight
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cleric Pillar of Wisdom simply snorted when I asked him your question (after all who better to ask than one who has such close association to the gods) and said, "He shouldn't have crossed the Bloodsabers in the first place!"  However, he did go on to explain that in all probability, since giving a newbie tunic to the shadowknight guildmasters in Freeport does not make you take any Innoruuk faction, if you should  happen to be lucky enough to kill the god of hate, it shouldn't affect your standing with the guildmasters.  He also said, in many cases, if you want to get an idea of the faction of guildmasters and forgot to do this when you were a newbie, you can turn in a newbie tunic to check who the guildmasters like by the faction increases you would gain. 
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi I'm Macca, Shaman of the 13th Circle of Halas. I guess this is more of a suggestion than a question, but why doesn't Everquest got funnies?  I'll explain "funnies" as an example on Christmas Day Santa Claus spawns and travels the world and if you kill him well, same with Halloween, the Easter Bunny, and a few other holidays of the year. It could mean say a giant skeleton eg.  Jack' o Lantern for Halloween or Santa Claus in his sleigh, or a jumping bunny.   Could even be GM run and watch the horror of 50th lvl players as Santa spawns as a gm run player at Mistmoore or Vox and start slaying out of hand. Just a thought anyway. Much appreciated if you could pass on the question and see what Verant thinks of it.
<br>
Macca
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh didn't you get some batwing cookies at Halloween?  Shoot, they were totally delicious!  If I remember right, I think more than one guide or gm might have been seen with a broomstick too.  Or maybe that was a hallucination.   Let's see if publishing your ideas here will bring any new cross-cultural events to the world of Norrath.  I sure agree that it would be fun.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail and well met Nepenthia, I have a question that I have been pondering.  I am a ranger.  Being thus, I attempt to travel the world looking for different societies to converse with.  Even though most (if not all) people know the common tongue, I have been attempting to learn all the languages that I can. My question is this, is there a limit to the number of languages you can learn and is there a limit on how much you can learn of it. Thanks in advance fair maiden  
<br>
Gian
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drat, I love to write long answers but this one will be short.  As far as I know there is no limit to the number of languages you can learn.  Of course, mastery could be considered a limit to how much you can learn of a language, but I think from the way I read your question, that the answer to the limits part of it, is no -- there are no limits to how much of a language you can learn.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, Nepenthia!  The lone mage Freem salutes you from the woodlands of the Faydark.  I have had a question twirling around in my ever-busy mind for some time, but never had the chance to ask.  We magic-users gain experience and skill from removing blemishes for our world, such as Orcs, Goblins and so on.  However, I wondered... do we also gain the mystical experience for simply casting our spells? 
<br>
Freem
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;*Curtseys back and thank you for your polite courtesies.*  Zeddic, the Pillar of Wisdom I applied to for an answer to your question, tells me that you can certainly gain skill by simply casting your spells, however, experience (mystical or not) will elude you should you only sit by the wayside casting away.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, here's a quick question: I am currently playing an Erudite enchanter but am thinking about starting a dark elf character (for the second) time but remember my last experience, I couldn't level at all because Nektulos forest is almost bare of creatures to kill.  Is there a better place near Nektulos/Neriak that a newbie dark elf can level? 
<br>
Rimuldar
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems like for the first five levels, the woods of Nektulos would be the most likely place a dark elf character could gain initial experience.    However, with a little care and some assistance in getting bound to West Freeport (assuming you could make it that far safely),  you might find quite enough bats and orcs and such in the desert near town.  Should you decide to try this risky venture, you'd want to get bound away from the gates of Freeport and avoid the guards at all costs.  Once you hit level 5 or so, then the farther desert of North Ro itself, might be a haven for experience for you.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed that some items have spell effects listed with a certain number of charges.  What happens when all the charges are used up.  Can an item be recharged? 
<br>
Bordador
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll find both items with charges that can be charged again and with charges that cannot be renewed.   Check the item when you get it and especially if it is related to a quest, I believe you may find a way to seek out the manner of recharging.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello. I am a dark elf necro of the Brell Serilis server. A few weeks ago, someone gave me a robe called 'Alliance Robe Blue.' It is AC 4 and magical, and looks blue. I have never seen another person wear one, nor had I heard of it prior to my obtaining it. Many people have asked me where I got it, and if at all possible I would like to be able to answer them. Thanks for your help!
<br>
Branlaen
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I freely admit, up front and in public, that Zeddic told me that the Alliance Robe Blue is in all probability a quest robe.  However, beyond that, I'm sorry but no one I spoke with seemed to know where it came from.  If anyone does know, please inform me so that I won't leave Branlaen with such a lame partial answer.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the expansion comes out will we be able to create Rogue Lizardmen? 
<br>
Lilweyen
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the only "official" word on classes for the Lizardmen is that that there will be monks.  Enterprising information seekers however, have examined the screen shots posted on the Kunark website (which you can access by going to www.everquest.com), in detail, probably with jeweler's eyepieces, and seem to agree that there's a good possibility the lizardmen will also have warriors, shadowknights and some sort of a healer.  The message boards seem to raise all kinds of reasons why lizardmen should also be shamans, druids and rogues.  This answer is, of course, made up almost entirely of speculation, so I guess we'll just have to wait a little longer and see which classes are chosen for the lizzies.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Quick Question...How do I host a small event? And How do I give out prizes? Thank you. 
<br>
Bakoff, Quellios server
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, if you are going to host even a small event --- plan, plan and then plan some more.  You may run into all kinds of unexpected interruptions and it will be hard to predict how many people will come, so planning is essential.  That said, I think maybe the  best way to start to prepare for an event you wish to host is to go to the public boards and read the postings of all the events announced in the last month or so.  That should give you a very good idea of structures you might wish to use for an event, prizes, fees, limits on levels, races and classes, etc.    It would be polite to also inform your local GM and guides of the date and time you wish to set aside, and maybe even invite them to drop in for a drop'o'th'wee and some pleasant chat.  So, once you have a theme for the event, plan the steps from invitations and announcements all the way through to the giving of prizes and  you should be fine.  (I'm not sure how prizes are usually given, actually, so it would also be good for you to attend some events similar to what you have in mind and see how others do it.)   Good luck!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a response to the Ranger in issue 102 asking about doing more than normal damage.
I am a level 25 Ranger, and I just started noticing that I can do more than normal damage recently.
First, you shouldn't worry about not doing as much as mobs, since with good fast weapons you can do smaller amounts of damage very fast.  Second, you need more strength.  You probably aren't going to notice anything below 100.  I notice an occasional extra point of damage with 114 str (buffed - normally 96).  I notice I can do three or four points of extra damage when I get my str buffed up to 121 or so.  Also, from what I understand, this will increase as your weapon skills increase (i.e. as you go up in level)  Time to buy some strength-enhancing armor/jewelry, I'd say.   
<br>
Howwl
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks Howwl for taking the time to write in with your ranger observations.  I appreciate it!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, more of a correction.  The mage you told begging NPCs was of no use really should keep at it; the rewards are great (if late in coming).  From what MY pillars of wisdom tell me, a maxed skill in begging yields platinum, some experience, and even quests you can't get anywhere else.  The balance is that the beg skill does indeed take time to level up, and the NPCs you beg will eventually get aggravated and attack you.  This I have no advice for, but as for leveling, I've spoken to a mage who said he learned his skill by begging his pet while he meditates.  Hope this helps. 
<br>
Olight
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?  Quests that can only be obtained by begging?  What a droll thought and really quite refreshing.  Tell YOUR pillars of wisdom thanks very much for sending along this information.   It is so tempting to immediately run out and start raising my skill in begging except I really do hate to die needlessly -- it is so dreadful for the complexion you know.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Last issue you mentioned,  "I think if you could follow your begging calling among pc's of your own race team (avoiding all others who would be much more interested in killing you than helping you), that adequate wealth might be more easily won than from begging from the npcs. "  I feel it necessary to point out that while this indeed will be less painful than begging from an npc (on a blue server), if such a practice is continued it might generate some bad feelings long term towards such a character (making a living from it) from the PCs, that may have long term effects on the viability on said character.  BTW, my name is a truncated version of Mac An Bhaird (Son of the Bard).  Enjoy EQ Express and while I've not been reading since the beginning, since I have every issue perused has provided laughs, information, or provoking thoughts.  Everyone keep it up!  
<br>
Macbaird
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah Macbaird thank you for writing and  you are probably quite right that someone who only begged might indeed run into some resistance that would slow his progress considerably.  However, I wasn't thinking of the leechiness of a whined "do you have anything you can spare a poor newbie" when I suggested a professional career in begging.  Rather, I was romanticizing the possibility of some skilled roleplaying and built-in amusement around the items begged for.  But, practically speaking, you're quite right.  (Nota bene to any would be beggars:  Put a mandolin in your arms, a smile on your lips and hmm a merry little tune and voila!  You're an entertainer, not a beggar.)
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This question regards Highpass. You see, around my seventeenth season I made my way through this place and was quite pleased to discover that I could now kill those dastardly orcs and gnolls that had made my previous travel so difficult. Joining a group, I rushed over to start beating in their brains with my staff when lo and behold, kill stealing erupted before my very eyes. After much concern and confusion I was told that the area is a Free For All Area and that due to the limited space and the same named creatures that it is near impossible not to accidentally kill steal so it was made one of the few areas in Norrath where this was allowed. At first I was distraught, I couldn't imagine such a method working but after an hour of giving it a try I was amazed at the goodnaturedness of everyone in the pass. None grew upset, several congratulated other teams when they managed to get exp for all the spawned beasties.  It became a bit of a game to see if you could catch all that appeared before the other team did. Freespirited and willing to have a goodtime I jumped in on this new way to fight and became quite adept at it in a matter of days. I spent a week there before it's double edge began to catch me. The frustration of being on the receiving end of a higherlevel, "better" team catching all the exp and you none.  But still, goodnaturedness ruled supreme and there were rare cases of anger.  Until.  A certain fellow blew his top about the area, screaming that we were all lowborn, illmannered thugs,(not quite his terminology, he was nowhere near as eloquent), and then to "prove" to us what it felt like to be kill stolen from he camped and brought back his eldest relation, a level 48 enchanter and proceeded to kill everything that moved for the next hour. His own group was disgraced and pleaded with him to stop and he refused saying that the area should never have been given the name Free For All.  So, Nep, is it, or is it not... Free For ALL?  I have currently moved on to mammoths in Everfrost, but this question haunts me... 
<br>
Niskani, 18th Season Druid of Tunare
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, your question has sent at least 53 people screaming into the hills of Qeynos all driven insane by this ongoing issue that seems to have no answers.  However, actually, after talking to some Pillars of Wisdom in this field, I think I can safely say that no, no matter whether it is Highpass or Lower Guk or anywhere else, these contested areas are not bound by the term "Free for All".  It's actually very complicated because while any npc is available for any pc to attack, there are rules on how those attacks may affect other players.  Many groups will simply choose to share the spawns.  They'll work it out to the maximum benefit of everyone present and like you described, will play in an atmosphere of goodnature.  In this situation, usually there is a rotation for the "valuable" mobs and assistance is even shared among the groups should one get in trouble in a battle.  Lower level npcs will be saved for the players who can gain experience from them, and higher level or lootdropping npcs will be shared in an organized manner.  However, at other times, a group may claim a monopoly, or a group may let the melee members of other parties wear down the target, only to steal the kill in time to gain experience and looting rights, or a group may deliberately interfere with other groups not only by killstealing but by training and other methods designed to get around the pvp block on the non-pvp servers.  In these instances, what some might call a free-for-all becomes a playing nightmare for some players who can no longer enjoy the zone or the game.  At that point, the words disruption and harassment may begin to apply and you will very often see a guide or GM appear as if out of nowhere and warn one or more groups for illegal behavior.  The line between legal and illegal play here is necessarily vague, but if you find that one group steps into every battle you start and takes the npc, or if they do everything in their power to get you to leave or to kill you, it's time to petition and get some help from the guides and GMs.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, something to say about monks.  Instill Doubt.  I have heard of a lot of monks (including me) who shun it.  But one day, I was bored, and had plenty of practices at my guild (17).  I put all 17 practices into Instill Doubt (Intimidation).  At that time I was fighting at Unrest, so I went there to find someone to duel me so I can practice Instill Doubt (Thanks Quong!) up to about 40.  It is currently 48.  First of all, Intimidation is not worthless.  Say you are fighting the hermit, in South Karana, as I do sometimes.  Now, if you pull off an Instill, the hermit will smack right into the stone wall surrounding his house for about... 30 seconds.  Or say a friend is at a bubble of HP and out of mana, and that you, the monk (same goes for rogues) are at one bubble of HP.  Say a mob comes up and attacks your friend.  Get up next to it, do Instill Doubt, then run to the zone like you have never run before.  Oh ya, Instill Doubt is a skill that casts a spell (Fear).  I know that because it is resistible.  If a mob resists it, it says "Your target has resisted the 'Fear' spell!".  Now here is how you get Instill Doubt to work.  Do not punch, do not strike.  Do not get hit.  Try not to move (it has worked for me when I have moved but like once).  Also, I have found out it works more if you are at the mobs side, than behind him.  Oh yea, I'd like to thank Sheklong for talking me into practicing Instill Doubt.  And Soladiel, if you want my honest opinion, I have got to say water is the best pet for a mage.  It is evened out.  It has decent HPs, deals out decent damage, etc.  The second best is probably Fire (lower HP than water, higher attack, and was a damage shield), then Earth (extremely high hit points and casts either Root or Snare, I forget, but has low dex and agi), and then last is Air.  I don't know why Air is last.  Let's see here, low HP, low damage, the only thing good is its decent agi and dex.  You may disagree with me, those are just my opinions. Finally, Vaeryl, I have got to point out that your opinion of high wisdom does not affect mana is wrong.  Lemme give you an instance.  My Cleric, I think, has 110 mana total (I put 15 into it I think, at character creation).  At level 9, he has 216 mana.  Now if I had not put ANY points into wisdom, he would have 189 mana.  Ewww I hope you never make a cleric, put all points into str or something, have a friend with a couple of HPs left and are out of mana.  If you had 110 mana you coulda gotten two more heals off, that's about 60 Hit Points.  Oh ya, trivia time.  Wisdom affects mana for these classes:  Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Ranger, and Paladin.  Intelligence affects these classes: Wizard, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, and Shadow Knight.  I have *no clue* what stat affects Bards, but who cares, they have ONE song that takes Mana, I think, and it's around level 40.  Just in case anyone didn't know :)

Aalon, 20 Monk (woohoo surname time), Veeshan

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Great to hear from you, as usual Aalon.  Hmm I wonder, have you ever thought about actually sitting down and writing an article to submit to EQ Express?  It could be fun you know!
