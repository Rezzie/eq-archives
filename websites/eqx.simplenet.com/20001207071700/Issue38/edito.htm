EverQuest EXPectations
	<br><br>
I decided to stick with the "EverQuest exp" theme on my first editorial, so bear with me if you cant's stand the pun :).
<br><br>
	I read Absor's editorial last week with interest, because he speaks about something that I have thought for a long time.  Online games, or really any computer game, can't replace the role-playing experience you get with a pen and paper role-playing game.  EverQuest, however, so closely attacks that border that I wonder how near to a seamless experience it can be.
<br><br>
	What is it about pen and paper RPG's that we like?  Surely we like the role-playing experience in another world along with the advancement of our character through struggle, sometimes life-threatening.  We like the interactions with our friends, that camaraderie that is created when a group of individuals triumph over some obstacle.  The banter, the long term teasing that goes on, is a big part of it.  Our group has legends that get better and better with each retelling.  Heck, I'll even tell you one:
<br><br>
	<em>Our mage had a gem from a necklace of missiles which was a 9-die fireball.  We were going to attack a bandit camp. We hoped to achieve surprise, since the bandits had a spell caster and were a bit stronger than we were.  The mage was to throw the fireball into the leader's (and spell caster's) tent, and that was our signal to attack.  The mage was about to throw it, and the GM says: "Just roll a d20.  If you roll a 1, you drop it on your foot, but otherwise you should have no problem."  Obediently, the mage then rolled a 1.  To our horror, the  signal to attack became a mushroom cloud where the mage used to be.</em>
<br><br>
	We like the challenge, the chance to use our wits.  I myself love the tactical discussion before an onslaught, the hammering out of an attack plan on the goblin camp, rich merchant's home, or whatever.  I also love that chance to sacrifice for the greater good.  My characters are always the ones brought back from the fight broken and bleeding, having given their all.  (I wonder what that says about me? Do I have suicidal tendencies? Am I altruistic, or a glory hound? :P)  Part of the tactical discussion are situations like Absor's where the idea to solve a particular challenge is very "outside the box" and completely confounds the GM.  All of a sudden, what was a huge challenge becomes incredibly simple when the problem is addressed a particular way.
<br><br>
	From what we've seen so far, in the published information and chat comments, it looks like EverQuest stacks up pretty well.  It has that rich background, that immersive experience we hope to get from a role-playing game.  It looks like, with the different abilities of each class that there will be a good chance to use tactics.  The banter is there too, with the camaraderie.  Anyone who has played in MUD knows that MUD communities happen, and good friends are made.  So what is missing?
<br><br>
	Quests.  No, not really quests, since 989 has been telling us that in-game quests will be available, and that some will be run by GM's.  As a god on MUDs, I have run GM-quests, and they are a blast for the GM and players alike.  What's hardest as a GM is not to make typos as an in-character NPC!  So there will be quests…
<br><br>
	But outside the box thinking will be very difficult.  Perhaps in a GM-run quest, they will be able to reward sideways thought processes, but quests in general, even gm-run, are sort of programmed.  It's hard to find a loophole in them, and if you do, it's probably a bug.  I'm not saying it's impossible, but I am not sure, as a GM, what I would do if the PC in front of my said the one thing I didn't think of, and that one thing would solve the quest.
<br><br>
	As for typing speed, well, I just think of all the dice-rolling I'm missing out on with computer games :). The average mud combat sequence would take 30 minutes in pen and paper games.  I too get frustrated with the need for typing, because even though my typing speed isn't bad, my typO speed is horrible. Wouldn't it be great if you could use audio?  Put a little mike in front of your PC and away you go :)  Maybe that'll be for EverQuest 2000…
<br><br>
	To conclude, I think EverQuest will significantly approach that borderline between pen and paper "reality" and our gaming expectations.  The key will be how many quests, how often, and how much interaction we get from GM's.  Some things, as Absor made clear, can't be done on a computer, so I'll probably stick with my RL buddies for that, even if they do drop fireballs…
