Slsslythk rose from his resting place at the sound of barking growls.  The Hairy Ones
were running around again, and if they caught him sleeping on the flat sunny rock,
they would try to hunt him down.  They had been active lately, and Slsslythk wasn’t
really sure why.   Perhaps it was time to investigate, and get some peace.

Slsslythk moved into a leafy cavern that went underground.  Leaves tickled his skin
as he ducked into the passage.  The dank smells of underground rot, mingled with the
faint, doggy smell of the Hairy Ones rolled over his tongue like a putrid fog, making
his eyes water.

The barking noises were coming from the area that Slsslythk knew was near a great
cavern.  The quickest way to that cavern was through the underground river, though
the chill of the water made him decide to pick up the river farther along its course.
No reason to lose the warmth he had gotten from his long nap.
