<em>Why do Player Killers (the VAST majority, anyway) play sociopaths?  I mean, what society in history has tolerated the wanton death and destruction that these people seem to thrive upon?  What defect in their character makes them crave killing of innocents?  Just a few thoughts that I have been asking myself.  But the most profound, why do we allow them to continue????

This is, in fact, a question I have asked myself many a time.  What is the appeal of PvP?  That is has its appeal is obvious.  The PvP server has as many players as some of the regular servers, and one of my roommates plays exclusively on Rallos.
<br><br>
So, in order to get the side of the +PvP player, I asked him a few questions.
<br><br>
Aklar:  Why do you like PvP?
<br><br>
PvP player (we'll call him, oh, let's say, Rob):   It gives you an opportunity to do away with someone who is annoying you without having to have him accept a duel.
<br><br>
Aklar:  What is better about it than the regular, non-PvP servers?
<br><br>
Rob:  It makes things more realistic.  On the regular servers, if you have a bunch of people who are not your race, they can wander in, kill your guards and there is nothing you can do.  On PvP, someone walks into a territory they shouldn't be in, there will be hell to pay.  That helps create better roleplay.  You no longer have to worry about only NPC's but everyone around you.  And, being able to be killed by someone you thought was a friend helps you realize how true friends are hard to come by.  It helps you form tighter groups, and makes things more dangerous and therefore more interesting.  It makes for better gameplay.  The cap on pking is probably what makes PvP workable in EverQuest, whereas it wasn't on other games.
<br><br>
Aklar:  What do you have to say to those who bash PvP?
<br><br>
Rob:  Don't knock it til you've tried it.  I thought it would be terrible, too, but when I got on it I found it was much more enjoyable than the other servers.
<br><br>
And there you have it.  The words of a die-hard PvPer.  And I admit that his arguments do make sense.  If you want a game that is based on suspicion and fear, that is…
<br><br>
It comes down to a simple question of personal style.  I play on a regular server, and Rob plays PvP.  The computers are in the same room, and all night I hear him cursing and muttering and (occasionally) leaping out of his seat and shaking his fist at the screen.  And laughing while he does it.  I tried out a character on Rallos, and was immediately disillusioned by the fact that the area just outside of Qeynos was a bloody free-for-all of level 3's and 4's.  The minute I stepped away from the guard, whack whack!  Some level 4 monk kicked the crap outta me and then (emoted) spit on me as I crawled back toward the guard.
<br><br>
Mmmm, fun…Very roleplaying indeed.  Bravo.
<br><br>
However.
<br><br>
The Dark Elf and other so-called "evil" races are fiercely loyal, so Rob says.  Any Drow caught killing his own kind has the entire PC population of Neriak on his tail.  They stick together, hound Halflings and Humans that wander in or by their zone, and generally act exactly like the Teir'dal are supposed to.
<br><br>
I think that Verant handled the whole PvP issue perfectly.  Make the switch available, and give them an entire server, all PvP, so that they can hang together and foster the seige mentality that seems to give them their fire.  And they do have fire, and passion, and a love for the game, as long as they can play their way.
<br><br>
The fact is, even on the PvP, the deWds have it rough.  The cap on Pking makes it harder to be a bully.  And grouping is still the best, and sometimes, only way to level.
<br><br>
In conclusion, all I can say is, I don't understand the allure of PvP.  But far be it from me to deny others their fun, whatever I may personally think about it.  What bothers me most is those people who feel that they must enforce their beliefs or playing style on others.  Leave them Sociopaths alone!  They aren't harming you!  And I am bloody tired of all the flame wars and spamming of message boards and general juvenile behaviour, from BOTH sides of the issue.  At the end of the day, I gotta ask.
<br><br>
Why can't we all just… get along?
