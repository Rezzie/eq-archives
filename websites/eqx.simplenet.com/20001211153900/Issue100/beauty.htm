I sit here at the tavern bar,<br>
And pray to Erollisi Marr.<br>
For someone else to be my friend,<br>
Before I age and meet my end.
<br><br>
A lonely life I've always led,<br>
My only friends live in my head.<br>
But now it's tavern dancing night,<br>
And lovely maidens fill my sight.
<br><br>
I see, as I put down my glass,<br>
A lithe, curvaceous elven lass,<br>
A wiggle here, a giggle there,<br>
A golden orchid in her hair.
<br><br>
If only I were not so shy,<br>
A question I would surely try;<br>
I'd ask her now to dance with me,<br>
A perfect partner she would be.
<br><br>
But many suitors gather round,<br>
A lover she has surely found.<br>
My chance is gone - 'twas ever slim -<br>
I'm far too slow and much too dim.
<br><br>
I look upon her radiant face,<br>
And see her dance with so much grace,<br>
She steps so light across the room,<br>
As gentle as a flower's bloom.
<br><br>
But now, what's this?  She smiles at me,<br>
No, no, a grimace it must be.<br>
She sees the ugliness I hold,<br>
Upon my face and in my soul.
<br><br>
Alas a monster she doth see,<br>
'Tis true, a beast is what I be,<br>
My mother was a sweet wood elf,<br>
But father; king of trolls himself!
<br><br>
A thief he prowled the dead of night,<br>
He took her then slipped out of sight.<br>
She fought him hard and struggled long,<br>
But at the end he was too strong.
<br><br>
So now I sit here in the shade,<br>
My only friends my beer and blade.<br>
Mixed race, mixed fortune is my life,<br>
As elf, not troll, I'd choose for wife.
<br><br>
But smile it is, I wasn't wrong!<br>
The elven beauty sweeps along,<br>
And settles down right next to me,<br>
The gods at last have heard my plea.
<br><br>
At first I stumble, tripping tongue,<br>
My words all come out strange and wrong,<br>
But soon I calm and find my voice,<br>
And now we're talking.  Oh rejoice!
<br><br>
We drink, we sing, we laugh, we talk,<br>
And now amongst the trees we walk.<br>
Her life, as well, has not been good,<br>
Her childhood dark and stained by blood.
<br><br>
So many bonds, so much in kind,<br>
So many common threads we wind.<br>
My thanks to Erollisi Marr,<br>
The Queen of Love you truly are.
