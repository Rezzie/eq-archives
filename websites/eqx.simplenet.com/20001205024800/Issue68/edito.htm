I just did something today that really bothered me.  I put someone on my ignore list.  While this may not bother many of you (in fact my adventuring buddy already has 12 on his list), it bothers me.  I try pretty hard to be civil and open and fun to everyone I meet, but this time I had just had enough.
<br><br>
This player had done an ooc request for quest information.  He had done it several times, and when I answered a slightly related question but not about that quest, he ooc'ed his request for quest information again.  I mentioned that 1) I had heard his first couple of requests, and 2) I don't give out quest spoilers.  I received several laughing tells from other players, but this player then started to pester me.  After I thought I had made it clear that I wouldn't tell him any quests, he stopped bothering me for a while.
<br><br>
Then, when I was hanging out at a favorite spot for players, this guy comes up again and asks for help on the quest.  I said no again politely, then he starts talking to his buddy in French, telling him how I won't tell him quest information. (I play on the Karana server, which is the semi-official French server.)  Since I'm fluent in French, I guess he was surprised when I told him (in French) that if he looked at all, he'd find plenty of quests.
<br><br>
Since then, I've heard from him every so often, and he's always asking me to give him a quest. I finally got tired of it, and put him on my ignore list.
<br><br>
I'm not some quest-hoarding snob, really.  I have helped people that I know have gotten stuck on quests, as long as I can tell they have tried to complete it.  I'm not some king of quest knowledge, either, though I know of about 20 quests.  There are others who have more knowledge than I, and I am stuck on one now and may ask someone I know for a bit o help.  I just believe that questing is it's own reward, and I have had to work pretty hard for some quests, and they have not come cheaply.
<br><br>
The real irony here is that the quest he is referring to, I found at first level. I've known about it since the beginning of final (it wasn't in the game during the time I played that area in beta).  It is painfully easy to find, and although you can't accomplish it until middle levels, it's not difficult at all.  This particular player could clean up with it.
<br><br>
During the initial exchange, one person sent a tell to me saying that he couldn't stand power gamers who wanted everyone to give them quest answers, but I've found several rewarding quests, which took little time, and were VERY worth the time spent.  The items I've received have made it a smooth leveling ride.  I'd call myself a power gamer, because I've succeeded on the quests to make my climb more rapid.  
<br><br>
I know that there are also broken quests out there, but Verant's turnaround has been pretty good.  I found one the other day and mailed it in, and it was fixed in two days.  
<br><br>
I guess the conclusion of this little ramble is really this: Quest for yourself.  It's more rewarding in an emotional and a power sense.  There are fantastic, useful items that can be obtained with a little typing between battles. You can then go and sell those items to players for exorbitant prices to fuel your spell-buying habit J. 
<br><br>
And don't ask me any QUESTions.
