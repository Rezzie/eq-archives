	<big><big>V</big></big>agarus fell, not with one thud but with two.
	<br><br>
Sadly, his eyes did not close on their own.  I had to reach beneath his helm and force
his eyelids down to cover that vacant stare.
<br><br>
Blood looks so black in the moonlight.  Once I’d stripped my gloves off and begun to
scrub my hands in the lake they were restored to their usual white pallor.  These gloves
would never come clean, and so I let them drop below the surface and be swallowed by
the reflections of moon and mountains.
<br><br>
Had I always been this ghostly?  I stared at my reflection.  Perhaps it was a trick
of the light; A prank played by the bewitching goddess of the moon or a glamour of the
water sprites.  But I had been born of a civilization half dead, and as such I was
prone to show the defects of my parents.  The white visage that blinked it’s
bewilderment at me was indeed my own.

Somewhere not far off, the night beasts howled.  Canines, most likely.  They would be
coming for Vagarus, his remains lying out in the open where I’d felled him.  And I
would let them have him.  It would be best that no living soul know that I had taken
the life of my friend; If his remains be eaten by wild animals, then so be it.
<br><br>
I am no murderer, or at least I had never thought myself a murderer.  But the
evidence lay a few feet into the bushes.  And what did I have to show for my treachery?
A handful of herbs, a satchel of used clothing, a few weapons which I could not use
and which would fetch little in the bazaar, and that damnable ring.
<br><br>
I don’t know what possessed me.  It was as if it had been mine, or it had belonged to
someone I loved. Because it was too small for his finger, he had hung it from a small
chain, to wear around his neck.  And he stood there, the thing dangling in the breeze,
and as I stared into the opal I saw things… Things so horrid they couldn’t possibly
have happened, yet they were so real.  I saw the pale faces of my people speckled with
dirt as men stood about, flinging dirt into the mass grave where they lay.  I heard
the laughter of conquerors thunder across that place; I could smell the ash of
scorched flesh mingle with the fires which claimed the village structures.

And for a second, as I looked at that time and these things which happened long
before my birth and which were passed to me only in songs of the bards, I saw someone
snatch the ring from off the finger of a dead girl.  "Off" the finger would be a
kindness of metaphor, for he actually snapped the finger off the body and slid the
finger out of the ring.  And as he held up the ring before his eyes I could see his
face, and it was that of Vagarus.
<br><br>
The rush of horror and unheralded rage took me.  I am a magician by trade, and carry
few weapons.  I have little training in the art of the blade, but in my strange
berserk state I pulled Vagarus’ sword from his sheath and swung the thing with
accuracy and perhaps with more strength than I had thought myself capable of bringing
to bare.  His head fell from his shoulders with the same casualness with which one
might take off their helm.
<br><br>
But this obscenity I had seen in the opal’s dark eye was impossible.  My people had
died centuries before Vagarus was born.  And all I could think was that perhaps this
thing was bewitched.  I had heard many tale of cursed goods and as part of my magical
study had read of how to make such a thing.  But I had never encountered one.
