	<big><big>I</big></big> don’t mean to compare Everquest to Ultima Online by any means, but the two do have one thing in common, the ability for players to interact with and even kill other human players.  Of course this type of "anti-social" behavior is discouraged by in-game rules yet just about everyone hates Player-Killers, claiming that we do not role-play, that we abuse bugs, and some will even out right say that we cheat.  This is incorrect for most of us, but yes there are some who cheat and do other out of game things to kill, but that is only a very small percentage.   It is very insulting, not to mention inaccurate, to stereotype EVERY pkiller based upon the actions of such a small percentage.  Lend me your ear and allow me to tell my story.

I have several on-line friends that date back to the BBS days.  On and off we would play on-line games together, mainly Subspace.  When we heard about UO we were all quite excited, and somebody came up with the name Inner Circle.  A name that would soon be widely known, feared by the masses, and respected by even the strongest most cunning warrior/mages of the land.

When we actually received our beta CDs we were all excited beyond belief, well, at least I was.  The beta basically sucked at first, but hey, it was a beta, so nobody was too upset.  Everybody basically did their own things, I was busy between character wipes trying to get a good combination of skills that would help me get off to a good financial start.  Others would spend a lot of time sparing to get their fighting skills high.
<br><br>
When the time came for the release of UO, we had all figured out which skills we needed to start with, and which skills could be quickly learned.  We learned how to advance our physical bodies, but it takes brains as well as brawn to be IC.  It was a learning experience, being able to kill without yourself being killed when outnumbered 2 to 1 is not an easy task, but it is one IC excelled at.  Now I can almost hear the skeptics "BS, you IC guys just killed everybody you saw".  That is true, but we would hang out somewhere, killing just about everybody who came our way until eventually a group would form to try to kill us.  It was at this point we were out numbered, but we were still on the offensive.  These were the glorious battles that we thrived upon; these were the battles where IC proved its domination with superior tactics.

Many say that we just killed newbies, but that is incorrect.  Early after the release when you could double click on a person and see their skill level, profession and notoriety (i.e. The Dread Lord Thumper Grandmaster Mage, or Fred Neophyte Scholar).  In those days we tried not to kill newbies, unless of course they were being annoying or trying to loot our kills.  Hell, we used to let newbies hang around to carry off the loot we didn’t want or could carry.  But for some strange reason OSI felt that the game would be better if nobody could tell the difference between a Neophyte and a Grand Master.  At that time we still tried not to kill newbies, but people took advantage of that, and would dress in leather armor, or even just a death robe, and try to sneak attack us while we were not paying attention.  Well after we were ambushed a few times by this tactic we were forced to kill everything around us.
