Dying has always had its drawbacks. 
<br><br>
I learned the hard way on a fateful day recently when I emerged into the world of EverQuest anticipating some fine hunting with a few friends. I had hoped to gather them for the purpose of ridding the barren, haunted plains of Western Karanas of that damned plague of giant spiders that has been crawling around harassing the natives recently.
<br><br>
It was not to be.
<br><br>
As I removed myself from the Void and stepped back into reality in Qeynos Hills, I looked around and screamed. Skeletons of all shapes and sizes were everywhere. Bodies littered the ground as far as my weak human eyes could see.
<br><br>
I screamed in pain as a sword sank into my arm and frantically began casting a spell to summon my trusty guard Jebkin from his resting-place deep inside the earth.
<br><br>
While casting, I turned to face the unseen enemy who had cowardly attacked me from behind. Multiple screams - much louder than the first - emerged from my lips.
<br><br>
Terror of all terrors, I was faced with a horde of attackers wielding fearsome weapons, some glowing, and all intent on stealing my very soul.
<br><br>
Things began to look grim. That was when I looked up.
<br><br>
My plans to run began to form as I realized that directly in front of me, in the distance, stood a monster so fearsome that my body began to shiver.
<br><br>
The fear racing through me caused my spell to fail and I knew that hope had been lost. Jebkin would not appear to aid my flight, and doom was coming for me.
<br><br>
The demons spawn skeleton king stood 20 hands or more and radiated a ghastly light. As my life energies dripped from me while a host of lesser minions attacked me methodically, the creature turned to stare at me with baleful evil eyes.
<br><br>
In pain, and dying, I screamed out for mercy but none was to be found.
<br><br>
The giant bone king glimmered and light flew from his skeletal hands. I gasped, and was struck. My death came instantly as the beam pierced my chest in mid-flight and blackness came.
<br><br>
Later, I became aware again, having been resurrected by some process I cannot fathom. Those around me claimed it was the benevolence of the gods but I do not have time for their foolish and unfounded beliefs.
<br><br>
Nonetheless I was grateful for the chance to live and breathe again, although found myself naked and cold, with no memory of the arcane arts I had once known.
<br><br>
I meditated, and slowly, remembrance came.
<br><br>
After resting for some time, I began the slow process of returning to the spot where death had taken me.
<br><br>
I approached fearfully, worried that I would be swarmed by the undead legions again. But when I reached the region where I had fallen, the land lay strangely silent. The silence itself spoke volumes about the magnitude of the disaster. Bodies lay hither and yon across the rich green hills. Grass stained with blood squelched under my feet as I surveyed the damage.
<br><br>
A few survivors screamed empty praises of thanks to their false gods as I wept for the dead.
<br><br>
Walking among the killing fields and the foothills, I came upon a strange sight. My own corpse, preserved with a look of ultimate horror on my face.
<br><br>
I was overcome by awe. Strange forces I do not understand work in Norrath.
<br><br>
I bent for a closer look at myself. Seeing my body still and cold, I noticed my arcane tools and manuscripts were still contained in my dead hands and in the backpack I had worn in life.
<br><br>
With a sense of surrealism, I gathered my equipment silently and began once again the battle to meaning here. Norrath is full of ignorance.
<br><br>
I will discover the answers to all my questions and one day I believe the populace will bow to knowledge instead of these archaic gods they now worship.
<br><br>
For now, I thank the unknown forces I seek for granting me reprieve from the undead masses that senselessly spread their demonic chaos through the lands I hold dear.
<br><br>
In hopes of understanding all,
