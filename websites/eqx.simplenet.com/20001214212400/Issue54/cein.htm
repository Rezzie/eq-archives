<p style="text-align: justify">


<b>PART 1: Cein's Departure</b>
<br><br>
With mind to travel the rogue named Cein began,<br>
A journey across the length and breadth of land,<br>
His feet did itch and hunger for the road,<br>
So he began without another goad.
<br><br>
Cein left the vale and crossed forest floor,<br>
Traversing light through dismal Kithicor.<br>
The rogue's bold heart was filled with death and fear,<br>
For comforting walls of town lay nowhere near.
<br><br>
When werewolf from its deepened sleep arose,<br>
The scent of Cein was felt upon its nose.<br>
With movement fast its dread claws were unfurled,<br>
And at the halfling its villainous cause was hurled.
<br><br>
His sense already primed with panicked fear,<br>
Did warn Cein of attack come from the rear,<br>
He spun prepared to fend himself with fight<br>
But thought again when wolf his eyes did sight.
<br><br>
Bristlebane does suffer no fools' pride,<br>
So Cein turned there and broke in fleeing stride.<br>
But hope was dashed when over shoulder peeped,<br>
The wolf at running pace it easily keeped.
<br><br>
With hope ill-dashed Cein offered one more prayer,<br>
In hope that Bristlebane would give him ear,<br>
"Lend me luck and quickness in my fate,<br>
So I might live, and werewolves chase negate."
<br><br>
With recent prayer still lingering on his breath,<br>
The rogue did run and jump to evade death,<br>
A low-borne tree branch Cein caught with his hand,<br>
And swung, flipped once, and behind log he did land.
<br><br>
Pounding heart Cein stilled and then he tried<br>
To blend himself to log so he could hide<br>
From werewolf's hunger heard a-snuffling near-<br>
That life was forfeit this dark night, his fear.<br>
 Hours laid near death's cruel door did seem<br>
The few dim moments wolf sought after him.<br>
But when he thought for sure he had been found<br>
Suddenly wolf left with quiet bound.
<br><br>
Cein gave moments' pause before he rose<br>
And Bristlebane he thanked for flight from foes.<br>
With footstep quiet did Cein then still his heart,<br>
And to the Commons turn-ed to depart.
<br><br>
All you who think to travel darkened woods like roguish Cein,<br>
Take heed at warning served so true by Thief-god Bristlebane.

<br><br>
<b>PART 2: Nektulous</b>
<br><br>
The forest thickened, blackened, dark once more,<br>
As Cein turned north in part from Freeport's door.<br>
Sounds like wisps swept steadily through the night<br>
In Nektulous wood Cein walked prim-ed for fight.
<br><br>
But here his fears were not of wolven-man,<br>
Nor of the giants roaming common land.<br>
Enemies wise did in Nektulous roam,<br>
Teir'Dal, the darkened elves here made their home.
<br><br>
Cein's path then crossed a guarded timber bridge,<br>
Four Teir'Dal warriors poised at crossings edge.<br>
The rogue thought better be to swim across,<br>
And into dank-deep waters his feet tossed.
<br><br>
But waiting there for morsel halfling-sized,<br>
Was a fish that met Cein eye to eye.<br>
Cein stroked to swim and hoped to gain a lead<br>
But learned that feet could not match finn-ed speed.
<br><br>
His lungs near busted, needful for cool air,<br>
And Bristlebane was once more sought with prayer.<br>
So turned he then and took a spear in paw<br>
To pierce the foul-temp'd trout through tail and jaw.
<br><br>
A single thrust was all his lungs would cede,<br>
A fated blow yearned halflings reckless need.<br>
But Bristlebane again heard desperate cry<br>
And guided Cein's sharp spear through fishes eye.<br>
 The fish made part and left rogue with fatigue,<br>
He swam to shore although it seemed a league.<br>
But as he crawled upon the water's edge<br>
Teir'dalish feet were formed in booted hedge.
<br><br>
With second not to spare the halfling left,<br>
The soggy place he laid a moment, cleft.<br>
He ran a dampened pace through limb and brush,<br>
The four Teir'Dal did follow in a rush.
<br><br>
As poor his wind was from his foe of fin,<br>
He outmatched three Teir'Dalish guards in run.<br>
But fourth, unladened with an armored hide<br>
Caught Cein with swordish blow in middle stride.
<br><br>
His choices bound to fight Teir'Dal or die,<br>
The rogue then turned to pierce the dark elf's eye.<br>
But elf was not as lame as fishy bait,<br>
And blocked Cein's deft spear-thrust while in mid-gait.
<br><br>
The two locked down a deadly game of tag<br>
To find one who would take foe's head in bag.<br>
Blow by blow they matched the other's skill.<br>
And could not bring their weapons down to kill.
<br><br>
Cein knew that he had tested Bristle's grace,<br>
And turned and ran another fleeing race.<br>
But elf, who not diminished from their tumble,<br>
Followed rogue to catch him in a stumble.
<br><br>
In vain pride, elf did not see his end,<br>
As Cein grabbed sapling in his spear-free hand,<br>
He whirled round guard with speed, a fury fierced,<br>
And through the Teir'Dal's back his spear-point pierced.
<br><br>
All you who think to try your hand at piercing dark elf skin,<br>
Remember Cein's great running skill, then notify your kin.

 <br><br>
<b>PART 3: Cein at Najena</b>
<br><br>
On plains red-streaked with ash and lava fume,<br>
Cein found himself, a long, long way from home.<br>
Sore from his fights with wolf and fish and elf,<br>
Rogue tracked across that barren rocky shelf.
<br><br>
Miles of wasteland, far as sight could go,<br>
Empty, save for troops of Solusek Ro.<br>
The stench was foul and seared the very air<br>
And halfling found again his creeping fear.
<br><br>
Till his eye was caught across the plain<br>
By sight of city proud, now laid in ruin.<br>
A cliff-face gate most ancient opened wide<br>
One door cast on the ground, as torn aside.
<br><br>
The rogue then measured greed against his fright,<br>
And decided entrance over cautious flight.<br>
With spear in hand he ventured to embark<br>
Through ancient door in then into the dark.
<br><br>
The odor foul grew worse, if not as hot,<br>
And halfling then began a hastened trot.<br>
By gleam of torch he hurried through the halls,<br>
As if his speed could flee the trailing smells.
<br><br>
But soon his run was halted as he found,<br>
A room of magic laced with crackling sound.<br>
As summoners most evil spelled and bled<br>
From blacker reaches, twisted, vile undead.
<br><br>
A startled yelp from Cein did test his fate,<br>
And sum'ners turned to glare at rogue with hate.<br>
Without a moment greater than a breath,<br>
Was Cein found faced with mob of unleashed death.
<br><br>
Quick spun and fleeing down the halls of night,<br>
Cein's foot caught stone, then tripped and lost his light.<br>
But fear of skill outmatched had left its mark<br>
And halfling scurried on throughout the dark.<br>
 When wall of flesh blocked hall in ogrish form,<br>
Cein feared he'd found the pinnacle of harm.<br>
But ogre turned and gave the rogue a grin,<br>
"No worry, half, for Grog do be a friend!" 
<br><br>
Greetings ceased the moment undead massed<br>
Round corner through which Cein had lately passed.<br>
But with a hammer larger than Cein's form,<br>
Grog swung with might and dispatched undead swarm.
<br><br>
Then plumes of fire and plasma hurled through air<br>
As mages dark brought evil spells to bear.<br>
And once again Grog caused attack to yield,<br>
By throwing up his mighty ogre-sheild.
<br><br>
The two new allies swung their blows and struck,<br>
And once again found Bristlebanish luck.<br>
Down fell the mages with their dark intent,<br>
Through cloth and bone Cein's lucky spear was sent.
<br><br>
Soon they rested catching bated air,<br>
When halfling spied a large emblazoned door.<br>
With ogre's head turned tending fearsome wound,<br>
Rogue snuck quiet and slipped into the room.
<br><br>
In cavernous chamber stood enchantress famed,<br>
Najena for whom the ruined city was named.<br>
She waved her arms, her chants tossed like a storm,<br>
Where she cast did elementals form.
<br><br>
But Cein, with wisdom gain-ed from his fear,<br>
Thought better be to sneak than to appear.<br>
Hush-ed rogue made way to witch's back,<br>
And moved through shadows into to alcove crack.
<br><br>
His deft hands slipped into Najena's purse,<br>
And what they found caused Cein to offer curse.<br>
For piles of wealth he pulled from leather bag,<br>
And  none the wiser was the evil hag.
<br><br>
When burst into the room with roaring shout<br>
Came Grog to see what halfling was about.<br>
Najena screamed insulted by the breach,<br>
And sent her minions into ogre's reach.<br>
 Only one thought raced through roguish mind,<br>
Get gold out safe and leave this place behind!<br>
With movement quick and a skill-ed fingers light,<br>
Did Cein run through the door and from the fight.
<br><br>
Soon Grog's footsteps followed from below,<br>
And matched the rogue, Najena in tow.<br>
But flight was prove'd to be the halflings bent,<br>
And two escaped 'tween steaming lava vent.
<br><br>
Once safe and rested from the harrowing run,<br>
The ogre and the rogue deemed journey done.<br>
They split the loot and parted then their path,<br>
The rogue much please the ogre lacking math.
<br><br>
For Cein, before the two of them did separate their ways,<br>
Made sixty-forty split of which the rogue would brag for days. 

<br><br>
<b>PART 4: Epilogue</b>
<br><br>
Roguish Cein now gathers year,<br>
And spins his worthwhile tale.<br>
And Grog will share with rogue a beer,<br>
When he's in Rivervale.
<br><br>
Hearken to the tale of Cein,<br>
You travelers this night,<br>
And know the tale of loss and gain,<br>
That ended up in flight.
<br><br>
For if you think you be so stout,<br>
As brilliant Cein and Grog,<br>
Najena will your heart cut out<br>
And cast into a bog!
<br><br>
Take heed and learn the story well,<br>
Of Cein make legend sing,<br>
And Ogre Grog, a youth in tale,<br>
Now crown-ed Ogre King.
