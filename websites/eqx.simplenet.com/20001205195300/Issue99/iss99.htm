Dear Faithful Reader (and all you others who have at one time or another read some of my ramblings and found them mildly entertaining),
<br><br>
It is with a heavy heart that I bring this news.  I am leaving EQX.

Ever wanted to role-play, but do not know where to start? Hang out with role players often but don't know how to fit in? This can be a challenge sometimes in your day to day in Norrath, even if you do frequently play with other role players. My friends had encouraged me to role-play more, as they said I should be able to after writing so many fictional stories for my EverQuest characters. Well I can attest that bringing a role into Norrath isn't always as easy as it seems.

	In some lands tis the day of the dead...
<br><br>
	So, the darkness descends upon us. The calm world we love and have come to know turns upside down and shows us all how insignificant we truly are. I look out from my tower in Tunare's temple and smirk at all of those people who would call themselves soldiers, adventurers...heroes. I cannot help but laugh at almost all of them. I turn from the sun's light and with ink and quill set out to put my thoughts down once again. The world has felt pain this day...pain through Hate.

Tauithar squinted into the bright light that reflected off of the dunes. In the distance, barely audible, was the sound of the ocean as it met the desert. Tauithar could make out the shapes of palm trees along the coast and everywhere there was sand, lots and lots of sand. Tauithar was currently standing on top of a particularly tall dune clearly waiting from someone. Clearly that someone was late for he was cursing a streak that would make Tunare blush several shades of red. He scanned the surrounding landscape cursing the heat and his armor that seemed to make the heat ten times worse than it was.

For a while now the talk here at EverQuest Express has been about what we are and what we can continue to provide to the EverQuest community.  We looked at the things that we like, the things that we think you like (not always the same thing, I'll admit), and whether or not we can continue to provide you with a worthwhile product.  And if so, what is that product.

This week I find myself at a bit of a loss for what to write for my editorial.   This is not national news, but I'm stuck, and you're stuck with me.  So, I'm going to inflict some of my ramblings on you, to see if you are man enough (or woman enough, or dwarf enough, or elf enough, etc) to take it.
