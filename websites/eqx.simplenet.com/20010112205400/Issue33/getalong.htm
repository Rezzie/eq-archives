When I chose to buy a computer and get involved in online gaming and such, I chose to do it so I could have a good time playing games with other people. Little did I know the complications that came along with it, the greed, the cheating, the mudslinging, and at times complete hatred for others. Growing up on console systems I never encountered this, not even close. In fact, I dreamt of the opportunity to play a game with 1000's of people at the same time. I thought it would be a blast. I thought that every gamer would dream of something like that. I guess I was wrong….
<br><br>
	My experience has been short when it comes to online gaming, but I am not a newbie gamer in the least bit. I have owned every platform system to hit the U.S., including Pong. I love games, in all shapes and sizes, be it rpgs, action, racing, sports, fighting, you name it, I play it. Sure I am partial to rpgs, since I spent a good portion of my youth playing pen and paper games, only to forsake them for skateboarding and women, but hell, we all make mistakes. What I am trying to say here is playing games is my release from the real world. I would make it my job if I could, but it seems like a real hard industry to break into.
<br><br>
	In the past few months I have been watching a general decline in community when it comes to EQ. When it first started, everyone tried to stick together and have a good time except for a select few. Those few were overlooked by the rest and we overcame the adversity on the different forums. Lately the ratio has been raped. I would say we are nearing 50-50 on this now. Guilds are popping up left and right that are there for the single purpose of annoying people. Irc channels have been falling into a state of decadence and the general feel of the EQ community is starting to leave a bad taste in my mouth at times.
<br><br>
	My first few weeks of researching this game back in mid-December were nothing less than phenomenal. The ideas and words, the creative minds coming together for one game, was nothing less than awe inspiring. I instantly felt at home. This was a game made by gamers for gamers. Best of all it was an immersive role-playing atmosphere that many were already jumping on, creating vast character backgrounds and assembling guilds for. It was nearly a dream come true for me to have stumbled into this when I did. I quickly leaped into the fray trying to meet up with some of these people that intrigued me so, and found a home for myself.
<br><br>
	It was a good time, still is a good time if you overlook all the shortcomings that are emerging. That isn't what I am here to talk about though. I am here to try and figure out why as gamers we can't all put aside opinions and enjoy the technology we have at our disposal. When I first played my Atari 2600(sears brand with the funny looking wooden console) it was fun for awhile by myself, but was lacking something. Namely a second player. So I went out of my way to have friends over (doing way too many chores and all that jazz) so I could have a better gaming experience. This continued on for quite a bit. I finally even got my father into playing games which was a task all in itself, but now he is an avid gamer at the age of 42. 
	<br><br>
	I want to have a good time when I play games, as do others. Sure, I don't like to lose, or fail, but know the difference between losing and being an ass. You can say, "Man I can't believe that! That sucks! I had you beat man!" As opposed to "I am going to make your life hell! I will hunt you down and beat you down, and when I am done doing that I will send others to do the same!" Which I have heard the latter way too much in online games. Have online games traversed the boundaries of gaming and taken it to a personal level? If so, I guess I am in the wrong genre.
<br><br>
	It seems that the human disease is infiltrating the gaming industry. It is more like a survival thing now, beating someone out in order to be on top of that hierarchy. Whereas I always thought of games as tools for enjoyment, a method of having fun with others, not an arena where only the best warriors are allowed to live. The computer gaming world has shown me that not everyone can play fair, and not everyone is a good loser. At times, those people who do lose turn to cheating, abusing bugs, mudslinging and many other various forms of poor sportsmanship. I don't understand.
<br><br>
	It is a game. Meant to be played by more than one person as a shared experience. Losing is supposed to make you learn, and try again so you can accomplish something. It isn't there to make you angry, or to make you want to cheat in order to succeed. Losing only makes you a better player in the long run if you learn from your mistakes. No matter what game or what genre. Winning on the other hand is supposed to give you a sense of accomplishment, but only if you win playing the game the way it was meant to be played. Cheating and abusing bugs to win is the same as committing petty crimes in order to make it through life in my opinion and never should bestow any feeling of accomplishment on anyone.
<br><br>
	Can the online gaming community change? Can we bring this wonderful thing that has been brought to us into the next era? Better yet, can we improve on it and make it one step closer to the holodeck? Can we as a gaming community realize the fact that it is a game, meant to be played as one, and there are people on the other side of the phone lines? This brings something to mind that my mother taught me. "If you can't play nice with others, than you aren't going to play at all!"
<br><br>
	I think 989 is trying to go to the next step. Trying to create a better gaming experience for all of us. They have instated the pvp switch for the different styles of game players. Also they seem to be implementing a strict policy on bug abusers and players who find the need to harass others. Plus they have mentioned a nifty ignore feature which will help also. Can the EverQuest community take online gaming to the next step? I am a firm believer that it can! The reason being, that I have met many a great person that wants to call this game home for quite awhile!
