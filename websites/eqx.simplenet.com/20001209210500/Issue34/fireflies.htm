   "Did you clean your room?" a hideous nagging voice called from another room.
<br><br>
"Yup. Sure did." I replied, as I kicked the pile of clothes, laying on the floor, into the closet.  
<br><br>
"Razor pick up that room or I'll have your father deal with you." She screamed from four rooms away.
<br><br>
You see my mother had eyes all over the house.  She could always see the truth, no matter how good the lie.  I called her Bewitched.  She could always catch me at my best tale, but she would never punish me.  This was reserved for my father.  
<br><br>
"You wait till you're Dad gets home!  GO TO YOUR ROOM!"
<br><br>
So I would go to my room and sit, waiting for the executioner to arrive.  
<br><br>
And I would wait, sentenced to die by excessive beatings. 
<br><br>
That wait could be the worse part of the punishment.  Just sitting there thinking about what he was going to do, or how bad it was going to hurt.  I could handle the groundings, I could sit in my room for days playing with plastic army men.  Recreating battles for days at a time.  Groundings were nothing (by the end of the first week I was crawling the walls. But I won't let my Mom know that). 
<br><br>
But I couldn't let that happen today.  I had to make sure I made her happy today.  This was going to be the single greatest adventure weekend of my life.  My three best friends and I were to go camping in  "Dead Tree woods"  (the woods behind my house).  Over seven acres of nothing but pine trees encapsulated in thick underbrush.  It was very difficult to get to our campsite, especially for an adult.  We would setup our camp, make a fire, and tell stories, and of course, run a few missions!
<br><br>
"Alright!" I said as I picked up the clothes from the floor.  
<br><br>
I straiten the room up best I knew how to, and headed out to the kitchen.  
<br><br>
"Mom can I stay all night with DJ?"  
<br><br>
This was to be our cover.  Everyone was to stay all night with DJ.  His parents were away on vacation, and his seventeen-year-old sister would cover for us.  She was having her boyfriend over for some suck face (eeeew), and DJ could hold that over her.  
<br><br>
I arrived at the kitchen, where my mother was busy scrubbing the counters.
<br><br>
"Are his parents going to be home?" She questioned as she continued to clean the counter.
<br><br>
"Yup" I lied with my best I'm-telling-the-truth face.
<br><br>
She though for a brief moment, then looked me in the eye and added, "Yea I guess its ok."
<br><br>
I had done it!   
<br><br>
"You're the greatest, Mom." I said as I raced to my room to pack.  "We are setting up tents in his back yard to sleep outside." I added once I entered my room, and in a semi muffled voice. 
<br><br>
I packed all my typical camp gear, a sleeping bag, a plastic drop cloth for the tent, and my water pistol.  I finished my packing and raced out of the house before I could get grounded for something I did or didn't do.  I headed for DJ's house.
<br><br>
I arrived at DJ's house to find all three of my best friends standing in his back yard.
<br><br>
"Razor!" DJ shouted.
<br><br>
DJ had the reddest hair I had ever seen.  We used to call him "Red", but since his twelfth birthday it seemed to piss him off, so now we just call him DJ.  He was the oldest member of our clan, so we nominated him our leader.  He had failed third grade two times.  His Mother told him he had a reading problem.  This would later be diagnosed as ADD (Attention Deficient Disorder), which I think we all had, which is why we got along so well.  We could change our train of though every few minutes, which made everyone happy.
<br><br>
He patted me on the back.
<br><br>
Also standing with DJ were my other two friends, David and Cub.  David was the brains of the operation.  He was good at making gadgets.  He was the type of person you could give one of those home science kits to, and he would build a weather station.  He was what I would call the typical nerd boy.  
<br><br>
Cubby, or some people called "Chub", was our comedian.  He could always make you laugh.  Usually at the expense of his own self esteem.  He often would joke about being heavy.  Which of course we thought was hilarious at the time.  It was a great chemistry that our group had.  We could invent almost any trouble to get in to.  That's one thing we never had problems finding, trouble.  
<br><br>
After a few rounds of Space Invaders on the Atari, we decided to head out.  We wanted to get into the woods before it got dark, so we could setup our tents, and build our fire.  
<br><br>
Sunset was upon us when we finally reached our normal entry point into the thicket that surrounded the woods.  After crossing the thicket, we reached the pine trees.  Hundreds of them that stretched up into the sky swaying in the evening breeze.  The ground was covered with pine needles, which made a nice soft crunchy bed, which was comfortable to walk on.  Inside the forest it was much darker.  We did not have much time.
<br><br>
"We better hurry man!" David advised.  "It's going to be dark in here soon.  Don't want the evil's to get us."
<br><br>
The evil's was a green goblin looking creatures that we all agreed existed.  The evil's would travel in groups of four looking for victims to eat.  They would suck them down into the earth, down into there dwellings.  It was a half joke between us, but sometimes I think we really believed in them.  I know I did.
<br><br>
We reached the clearing where we had camped many times before, and began to collect wood for our fire, and setup camp.  By dark we had a nice fire going, which we sat in front of.  We talked about typical guy stuff for a few hours, arcade games, TV shows, and cartoon super heroes.  We also agreed this was our last camping trip for the summer.  <em>School would be starting in a few weeks</em>.
<br><br>
At about midnight (I'm guessing) we had become very bored with our fire.
<br><br>
"Hey we are going to run out of firewood soon.  We need some larger logs that will burn longer."  David said.
<br><br>
Everyone looked at each other in deep thought.  
<br><br>
"Let's go find some." DJ said
<br><br>
Everyone agreed.  So we set out on our first mission of the night.  
<br><br>
After traveling in the dark of night we reached a clearing.  Sounds of automobiles could be heard in the distance travelling fast.  I knew we were near the interstate.  Ahead I could see the Mobile gas station.  It had been closed for years, and was mostly just a parking lot for semi trucks.  We headed toward the station.  
<br><br>
As we reached the station we discovered a lone eighteen wheeler truck sitting in a dark area of the lot.  We walked towards it to investigate.  
<br><br>
"I bet this black thing would make a huge tent!" Cub said.  
<br><br>
We each looked at it.
<br><br>
"Yea I bet this would cover our whole camp site."  I added.
<br><br>
It was a flat bed coal semi, and the tarp was used to cover the contents of his load.  You can picture how large this tarp must have been.
<br><br>
"Lets take it!" DJ ordered.
<br><br>
So in our stealth mode we unfasten the latching holding the tarp and all four of us spread out on this fifty foot roll, and carried it towards the woods.  
<br><br>
After twenty minutes of carrying the tarp, and out of breath, I said, "Man this damn thing is heavy." 
<br><br>
"Keep going.  Its not that far." DJ said.
<br><br>
"This is going to be great!"
<br><br>
"Yea our own tent city baby!"
<br><br>
We all laughed and continued on.
<br><br>
After about two hours, I'm guessing, we reached the campsite.  It was at least 2am.  We were all tired and out of breath.  We collapsed near the flameless campfire.  After a few minutes of catching our breaths my mind started to wander.  I was suddenly hit with a thought.  This notion caused me to panic.  I could feel my whole body go numb.  
<br><br>
"What if this thing cost a thousand dollars, and someone wants to find it?"  I questioned.
<br><br>
"What?" The three of them said, looking at me.
<br><br>
"Well.  If this is worth a lot of money we could get into some serious trouble.  Man they could send us to prison.  We would have a criminal record for stealing!" I said.
<br><br>
"Is he serious?" David questioned, his voice cracking with uncertainty.  
<br><br>
"Naw.  They wouldn't send us to prison.  We are just kids."  DJ said.  "But they could send you to juvenile school." He added.
<br><br>
"Well I don't what to go there either." I said.
<br><br>
We sat thinking.
<br><br>
"What do we do now?" Cub questioned.  The red coal from the previous fire was enough light to show that Cub was crying.  "I can't go to jail."
<br><br>
It was then that I came up with one of my less than brilliant ideas, which usually resulted in getting us into more trouble than the actual offense.  "Lets burn it.  If they can't find it they'll never know who took it." 
<br><br>
"That's a great idea," DJ said.
<br><br>
"Well we should burn it in sections.  This thing is huge.  It will take all night." David informed us.
<br><br>
"Great then we will have a nice fire." DJ said, as he attempted to light the end of the tarp.
<br><br>
What no one seemed know that night was that a tarp is made from petroleum products.  We stretched out the tarp so that only one end was dangling in the fire pit.  The corner of the tarp immediately caught fire.  As it burned the entire woods suddenly become well eliminated.  DJ shoved more of the tarp into the fire, as the new section would instantly catch fire.  It was at that instant that I noticed the flames were reaching high up into the pine branches.  
<br><br>
"Hey stop the flames are going to high." I shouted, but a little two late.
<br><br>
The flames increased as more of the tarp caught fire.  The dry pine branches high above the fire began to ignite.  
<br><br>
"Put it out." David screamed.
<br><br>
We stomped on the tarp trying to slow the spread of fire.  David grabbed a blanket and tried to suffocate the heart of the fire, but it too caught fire.  
<br><br>
"R U N!" DJ shouted.
<br><br>
By the time we turned to run the entire campsite was in flames.  The pines around the campsite were also burning.  The thick black smoke from the burning tarp rose high in the air.
<br><br>
We ran towards DJ's house.  
<br><br>
We arrived at DJ's house.  I looked at my clothes to find them covered in black.  My skin was black.  I looked at the other three, to find they were covered head to toe with black soot.  
<br><br>
"Look!" DJ shouted, and pointed towards the forest.  
<br><br>
You could still see the light from the fire.  The fire seemed to consume the entire seven-acre forest.  It was at that moment that a city police cruiser pulled up to also observe the fire.  You could hear him calling on his radio for assistance.  
<br><br>
"Hey you boys.  Come here."
<br><br>
We looked at each other and walked up to the police car.  The police officer looked us over.
<br><br>
"You boys know anything about that fire?"
<br><br>
"No"
<br><br>
"Oh is that a fact.  Well I'm going to need to ask you some questions.  Get in the back."
<br><br>
We got in the police car.  Cub started to cry and immediately said;  "I didn't want to steal the tarp.  I don't want to go to jail.  Oh God!" Cub burst out in tears.  
<br><br>
Once the fire trucks reached the woods the fire fighters started working on containing the fire.  Several other police cruisers arrived on the scene.  We were taken to the police station downtown.  We were instructed to sit on a bench near the booking officer.  One at a time each of us was escorted back to a room and we were given an opportunity to tell our version of the story.   Of course they got four completely different versions of the story.  
<br><br>
Later my parents arrived and I was released into their custody.   When I got home I received the worse beating of my life, which lasted about two hours, and to this day I'm still grounded.
