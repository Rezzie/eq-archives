<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
  Road to Kunark<br>
  Chapter One: Starting Out.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the story 
  of an unexpected journey which I participated in. Everything is as factual as 
  my memory makes it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It all began one 
  day when I woke up near the woods outside Kelethin. I was very excited because 
  I knew that today my guild, The Amazons of Vallon Zek, were holding a race and 
  bazaar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Looking to the 
  sky I noticed the lateness of the day - oh my! I'd overslept. Quickly gathering 
  my gear I began the long run to the Butcherblock Docks. When I reached my destination 
  my ears were assailed by a loud din. As I stretched and looked around I noticed 
  a few of my Amazon sisters nearby. Ranini and Finnie seemed to be selling raffle 
  tickets to a lottery being held. I decided to join them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Greetings 
  Sisters,&quot; I formally bow and salute each.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They answer me 
  back, &quot;Greetings Katania.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;How have 
  you been?&quot; Ranini asks concernedly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am doing 
  well, hunting is plentiful this year,&quot; I reply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Kat, I have 
  some armor for you if you need it.&quot; This kind offer comes from Finnie who 
  is also a Half Elf Ranger and understands the plight of a poor 10th circle sister.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Many thanks 
  Finnie! Yes - I would really appreciate it,&quot; I reply gratefully.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Fine, we 
  will go to the bank after Ranini is done,&quot; She replies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we chat Ranini 
  finally finishes selling tickets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Katania, 
  roll the die!&quot; I gratefully comply, producing a magic die and roll it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The number 
  is 105!&quot; I shout so all can hear me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are more 
  than a few groans and then a short but violent fight breaks out between the 
  winner and a sore looser. Ranini quickly quashes the fight and we set out for 
  Kaladim, the home to the dwarves. If you have never been to Kaladim, you should 
  go! It is all underground and can sometime get confusing but the masonry work 
  is beyond compare. After wandering around for a bit, we three sisters finally 
  find the Bank.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ranini decides 
  to take a nap. She is very tired after all the excitement of the day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the bank Finnie 
  gives me some wonderful chain mail gloves and a very nice pair of leggings. 
  She had earned some fine new armor so was kindly giving her old set to me. I 
  was carrying almost everything I owned on my body or on my back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Ranini sleeps, 
  Finnie and I break our fast and talk about the new continent which was found. 
  I had never visited the outpost there called Firiona Vie (after our brave Elven 
  Princess). Finnie confided that she has traveled there many a time and was heading 
  back. She asks if I wish to join her, and being young and stupid - I gladly 
  agreed to go.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hindsight is a 
  horrible thing! Sitting here now, grateful to be alive - I realize that at this 
  point is where I make my first mistake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feeling confident 
  that my older Amazon Sister Finnie can tackle any situation, I blithely get 
  my gear and follow her out of Kaladim.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THESE WERE MISTAKES 
  NUMBER ONE AND TWO!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">#1: As you will 
  discover with further reading - having a high circle guild member traveling 
  with you does not guarantee that you will meet with success or that they can 
  save you in all situations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">#2: NEVER travel 
  for any distance, long or short, with all your gear on you! I knew this rule 
  but for this instance chose to ignore it because of my false sense of security. 
  As you will see, that was not the smartest of choices.</font></p>
<p align="center"><br>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chapter Two: 
  All Aboard</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the Docks we 
  chat and wait on one of the longboats to be ferried to the Maiden Voyage - the 
  huge ship which trades with the outpost and it's inhabitants. While waiting, 
  Finnie and I notice that we were becoming tired and drowsy. It was very difficult 
  to keep our eyes open. Finally the ship is sighted and the longboats head out. 
  When the longboats get to the ship I can hardly drag myself up the plank.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only Innoruuk (or 
  more likely, one of his followers) knows why this terrible thing happened to 
  me. One moment I am walking up the narrow, steep, slippery slope of the gangplank 
  and the next I feel a hard tap and am falling through the air.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My screaming is 
  cut short by a mouthful of water as I struggle to get back to the surface. I 
  hear my sister shout my name as the ship pulls away from me, taking with it 
  all chances of returning to shore. Her faint words cannot carry through the 
  buzzing in my ears as I struggle to stay afloat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You must remember, 
  dear reader, I am a half elf ranger - uncomfortable out of the forest. I follow 
  the teaching of our forest mother Tunare who I called out to and prayed to for 
  help.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I did notice as 
  I swam that I got better and better at staying afloat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once and awhile 
  brother wind brought to me voices. I heard Finnie struggling to find out a location 
  of an island I could swim to. I heard Ranini getting in touch with a Troll she 
  once helped out who was familiar with Orc Island - the closest island to me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As day turned into 
  night I despaired of ever finding any shore. I don't know that I slept in the 
  nightmare that had become my life. But the voices stayed with me on through 
  the night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next day dawned 
  brighter and I prayed to Tunare, thanking her for her assistance. I swam and 
  swam and finally found the ship again! I yelled and tried to climb up onto one 
  of the longboats but my travails were in vain. The ship left again without me 
  and I could not board the long boat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I knew that I had 
  come to the end of my life. I had no hope and decided to let myself sink under 
  the deep blue sea, loosing all I had gained in my short life span - when I heard 
  a crude voice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was an Ogre! 
  Yes, an Ogre on a small skiff! I shouted until I was hoarse but the currents 
  were pulling the skiff quickly away. The ogre tried to help me, even gave me 
  the star location of Ogre Island, the weigh point for the Dark Races on the 
  trip to the lost continent of Kunark. But the Ogre (of course) could not save 
  me. From what I gathered, the Ogre felt sorry for me and would rather eat me 
  than see me drown (felt it was a waste of a tasty elfie).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the star location 
  I had hope and set out that night to swim to Ogre Island. The swim was long 
  and strenuous. It was hard to keep going, but on the wind I heard the urging 
  of my sisters not to give up, not to surrender. My Amazon pride filled me as 
  I swam stroke by painful stroke.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  <b>Chapter Three: Lost in the Desert</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, I stumbled 
  onto land and immediately fell into a deep, deep slumber.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Daylight woke me. 
  I cautiously began moving around, broke my fast and began to explore the island 
  I found myself upon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The island was 
  large and quite barren. Only a few ruins and some tattered, dusty tents remained. 
  I could still hear distant voices! Imagine my dismay when I realize that I have 
  reached the wrong island. I couldn't help but cry in rage and frustration. When 
  my tears were used up I gritted my teeth, grabbed my pack and waded out into 
  the sea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This act was the 
  bravest act I've ever committed. I have ventured into Crushbone alone to help 
  a friend and I have saved many a life from flickering out by binding wounds 
  and protecting the weak. I have been the bane of the Crushbone Orcs and I have 
  faced monsters and evils too terrible to name. I have bravely stood for Justice 
  and Honor against hordes of crazed gnome killers and countless undead monsters. 
  But this one act almost broke me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again I was immersed 
  but I continued swimming until I saw land. When I beached I was exhausted but 
  still alive, and I could hear voices carried by the wind to me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I found the Orc 
  encampment and also the dark docks. I watched Trolls and Ogres unload some supplies 
  and watched for the raft which would hopefully take me to the Oasis of Mar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All I had to do 
  is wait for darkness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Darkness crept 
  in quicker than I had expected. With my superior night vision I watched the 
  barely pieced together raft float toward shore. I waited until the last minute 
  before running into the surf and jumping on it. Freeport bound at last I carefully 
  set down on the weather beaten boards to wait as magical forces draw the ragged 
  raft and it's lone inhabitant toward a familiar but distant shore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The raft sailed 
  through the night - through silence and squall until at last I could see the 
  barren stretch of coast known to all as The Oasis of Mar. I quickly stood and 
  braced myself - for I could see figures on the shore with my sharp Elven eyes 
  and they did not look very welcoming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the raft got 
  closer to land I took two slow and deep breaths and dove off, swimming with 
  all my might toward the shore away from the dark encampment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was almost paralyzed, 
  my joy was so great at finding land. I dragged myself off the beach and hid 
  behind a pillar of stone trying vainly to regain my strength and decide which 
  way to head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I truly believe 
  that Innoruuk was following my journey that day. For with no warning I was struck 
  from behind. I was weak and bleeding and barely caught a glimpse of my attacker 
  before I fell into darkness. Then the desert madman raised his fist for another 
  blow and struck me dead.</font></p>
<p align="center"><br>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chapter Four: 
  A Waking Dream</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All I saw was white. 
  I felt as if two suns were glowing in my head. Bright, bright white. In the 
  white I imagined I saw a figure - I drifted forward to see who it was, and was 
  shocked to see my mother. Confused I looked for my father and suddenly he is 
  there to. I try to reach them, I run and run but it feels like I am running 
  in water. Suddenly they stand before me. They look young and happy and I want 
  to hold them so bad - but cannot seem to reach them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;No Daughter, 
  that is not the way it is to be,&quot; my mother says sadly as I reach out to 
  hug her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Oh Mother 
  - Oh Father - I have missed you so! I am so glad to see you. I never want to 
  leave you again.&quot; With tears in my eyes I try to move but I am frozen in 
  place.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Daughter, 
  heed your mother for she loves you well - as do I. We have been sent to tell 
  you that it is not your time and you should fear not death, for you are well 
  loved by Tunare and have a long and important life ahead.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;But Father, 
  I do not understand,&quot; I say in amazement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Change is 
  coming to these lands and with change comes strife. You are needed down below 
  to help others and continue your path. The fates have decreed that you live 
  long and continue the path that you have chosen.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I do not 
  wish to go back, I want to stay here with you and mother,&quot; I plead but 
  to no avail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Hold yer 
  Weesht,&quot; my Father thunders angrily at me. Immediately I snap my mouth 
  shut and bow my head in respect for I know I have gotten to the end of my father&#146;s 
  patience.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His tone softening 
  my father continues.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is not 
  for you or I to choose - your destiny was woven the moment of your birth and 
  you must fulfill your destiny, whatever it may be.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We love you 
  very much daughter,&quot; my mother says with a misty smile, &quot;but you have 
  many tasks to complete and long journeys ahead.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Father holds mother&#146;s 
  hand as he finishes, &quot;We are very proud of you and will watch over you 
  as much as we can. Do not feel sad daughter, we shall await you here and will 
  always travel with you.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;How will 
  I find you?&quot; I cry in despair as they begin to slowly fade away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I hear my father's 
  raspy chuckle, &quot;Do not worry child, it is for us to find you - and the 
  view from up here is pretty good.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  <b>Chapter Five: Freeport Bound</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As my father&#146;s 
  last sentence fades in my mind I jerk awake to find myself back at Orc Lift.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rubbing my eyes 
  in amazement I stand up and look around. I am standing next the guard at the 
  bottom of the Orc Lift. I am wearing clothes but all my gear is gone. I think, 
  where can it be?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What day 
  is it?&quot; I ask the startled guard. He scratches his head and looks around.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Where did 
  you come from? You weren't there a second ago.&quot; He sounds terribly suspicious.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Never mind 
  that good sir! What day is it?&quot; I demand. Giving me a confused look he 
  says,</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The day of 
  our Lady, 167 c.e.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Thank you 
  kind sir.&quot; I say respectfully as I walk toward the next lift quickly calculating.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is then I realize 
  that I have only wasted a day! But where is my gear? I have no food, no water 
  and no armor. It has to be somewhere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As I reach the 
  Lift to the Ruins I make a quick decision - I will consult the oracle in the 
  outcast camp. It is a quick run to the outcasts encampment where I am well known.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had traveled 
  within the brightly painted wagons of the outcast caravan and lived with them 
  in their sheer, brightly colored tents for most of my young adulthood. Once 
  there I search the flamboyantly garbed travelers for my dear friend and travel 
  mother Serean O'deli.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Serena O'deli is 
  the leader of the outcasts. After a loving hug she quickly gave me food and 
  water and after hearing my tale, called upon the forces of nature to help me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Your body 
  is in the desert, in the place of the Mar,&quot; she intones deeply - gazing 
  into her energy orb.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Why yes, 
  that is where I was last at!&quot; I say in amazement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Well then,&quot; 
  she says briskly - dispelling the orb with a graceful wave, &quot;that is where 
  your old body and gear must be.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I felt really dumb 
  at this point so I thanked her quickly and went on my way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The run through 
  Greater Faydark and Butcherblock is very familiar to me. This is a trade route 
  I use often to deliver mail for the Bard's guild (they need all the help they 
  can get) and for rare items only found in Freeport - the main seaport to Antonica, 
  the continent I needed to be on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ship was just 
  setting sail as I ran to the end of the dock and hopped quickly aboard. The 
  journey across the Ocean of Tears was quick and thankfully painless. But I still 
  felt very thankful to be alive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MISTAKE #3: Towns 
  are NOT SAFE! Guards at most towns are lazy, and will not protect you unless 
  you are on top of them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was walking under 
  an arch headed toward the west gate of Freeport. Suddenly, I was hit from behind 
  with a ball of energy. I was stunned and tried to head toward a shiftless Freeport 
  guard. I couldn't move. I was rooted to the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I heard a raspy 
  chuckle as in front of me appeared a dark elf. With a wave of his arms a ball 
  of flame burst on me. As I felt myself bleeding to death I managed to say,</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Please do 
  not kill me. I have nothing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amazingly the dark 
  elf immediately stopped his spells and came closer to inspect me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ahh,&quot; 
  he said in a husky voice, &quot;you have returned from the dead, no?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Yes,&quot; 
  I managed to reply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before I knew it, 
  he was helping me up off the ground and dusting me off. &quot;Poor little one, 
  you need to have your feet bound to this place - do you not?&quot; he said sympathetically.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was stunned so 
  I replied,</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Yes I do. 
  I am trying to find my body.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He seemed to understand. 
  He steered me toward the gate and offered, &quot;Let me bind you to this place 
  little one, so you will return here if you perish.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blame the lingering 
  effects of his spells, or his honey smooth voice - but I accepted this strange 
  Dark Elf&#146;s offer and allowed him to bless my feet to the ground outside 
  the Freeport gates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With a cheery wave 
  and these parting words he took his leave, &quot;Take care little one and beware, 
  these lands are not safe for one such as you!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And then he was 
  gone.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  <b>Chapter 6: New Beginnings</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It took until evening 
  to find someone in Freeport who could give me directions to the Oasis of Mar. 
  Since I was hungry and thirsty anyway, I relaxed near the cool grounds of the 
  Cleric guild until nightfall.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At nightfall I 
  headed across East Freeport onto the blistering sands of the North Desert of 
  Ro.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having been warned 
  what dangers to expect, I stayed well away from any moving thing. It was a long 
  run, but at least I didn't have to deal with the blistering heat of daytime. 
  I crossed dunes and valleys. I ran around snakes and giant scarabs. I avoided 
  Sand Giants and Dune Madmen until finally I crossed into the Oasis of Mar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here I had to follow 
  the stars until I saw the pillar of stone jutting out of the dry land, where 
  my corpse should be. And then I noticed that Desert Madman. The sun was just 
  rising and he was sitting with his back to my corpse, gnashing his teeth and 
  foaming at the mouth as he talked to his shadow in disjointed phrases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was only 
  one thing to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking a hand full 
  of stones found at the base of the pillar, I crept around the pillar and threw 
  a couple up the dune. Hearing the noise, the Madman spun toward the sound and 
  on all fours went to investigate. I snuck back to my body, and grabbing it under 
  the armpits - drug it toward the pillar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had to repeat 
  this maneuver server times until I was well out of range and safely concealed 
  behind the pillar of stone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Picking my gear 
  off my dead body was easy. I quickly donned my armor and broke into my pack 
  to quench my thirst and kill the hunger gnawing at my stomach. Then the most 
  amazing thing happened. I glanced toward my body to make sure I missed nothing 
  and it was gone. It had completely faded away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After breaking 
  my fast, I began the long run back to Freeport.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had some close 
  calls. But I didn't die again. All in all, I believe that my journey back was 
  blessed. Once inside the gates of the city, I decided to camp near a wall and 
  scribe my adventure down for future Amazons to read and learn from.</font></p>

  the Fates have in store for me, so I shall take the lessons I learned from my 
  travels and apply them. I am not happy that Innoruuk loves me well. And I never

  It is a wonderful thing to find that even lost in the Timorous Deep - I was 
  not alone. My Amazonian Sisters were there whispering to me on the wind every 
  stroke of the way.</font></p>
