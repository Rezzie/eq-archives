Hoi there all! Lrets D'pearl here live from the hordes of people waiting in line to get a front seat ticket for the premier of Master Bard, Jor' Lucaaaz', epic play ... Menacing Phantoms. Expectations are high here and anticipation has risen to a fever pitch as literal hordes of fans have camped out for the past few weeks to ensure that they might get into the very first play of this epic drama.

 <em>Things get a little bit ugly when accusations of cutting in line were thrown this Reporter's way ... but notice the length of this line ... it stretched literally from Surefall to BlackBurrow</em>
 <br><br>
Production and local economic markets, except for those who have jumped on the marketing bandwagon caused by this mega-platinum entertainment success, has dropped to a near standstill and employers have given up on threatening their employees with firing them and just shut down for the entire week that the play is first opening on. Can a play REALLY be worth this kind of commotion and hub-bub?! Well .. only time will tell, and this brave reporter will make sure he gets into the first showing just so that he may report to all you loyal EQExpress readers the down-low on this highly anticipated play.
 <br><br>
This is Lrets D'pearl Aspiring Bard extraordinaire and Freelance Reporter for Fit to Print, who ran this story instead of the female metal armor story cuz he got his arse kicked too many times by female warriors who refused to show him the finer errr um details of such armor ... signing off until next time when I report on ... what?!?! Walking cities?!?!
