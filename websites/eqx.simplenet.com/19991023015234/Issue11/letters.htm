<p><em>We received many letters regarding the article in Issue 10, <a href="../Issue10/thumper.htm" target>A PKillers Story</a>, by Thumper.  
We are only going to publish three of them.  Our appologies to those that we did not print.  I also must 
ask everyone to no longer send comments about this article, as we will not be printing any more.  :)</em>

My complaint is about the Letters to the Editors: A Pkiller's story was
inaccurate.  It is unfortunate that you do no research what-so-ever into
the authenticity of this (and I'm assuming any) article.  I have no
knowledge of the events that transpired in Thumper's story.  This
doesn't mean anything, much though.  His assumption that "...within just
a few minutes we  were surrounded by what  seemed to be their entire
guild."  I find that hard to believe since the membership was, at that
time, in excess of 100 members (we're down to 70 or so now).  I find it
a gross exageration that the "entire guild" was there.  I find it hard
to believe that more than 10 TB members were there (a large gathering of
a single muli-national guild in any case).  There has never been a
leader in the guild named Milamber.  The leaders we  have had, were
Nightfall, Ender, and now Winfield.  Nobody in the Leader position could
publicly condone pkilling by befriending a pkiller (in game) as it
violates our general moral standing.

  Also, I'd like to point out a PvP
of 5 people versus our "entire guild" would not depend on one single
player, our leader or not.  Our guild is based on a democracy system
where majority rules.  In a situation where "they [TB] were itching to
jump us [IC] then we would."  A few members of our guild will not attack
unless attacked first, but most of us make that all to often assumption,
and in 99.9% of the times a reality, that Dread Lord=Player Killer.
Anyways.  We would like for you to acknowledge the mistakes in the
article that have maligned The Band

of this particular article, I would never have been able to do so.  There will be
as many different stories as there were people at the event.</em>

Hello there.  I'd just like ask how the article from Thumper in the last
EQX got out of the trash can and into the (virtual) paper?  Are you
really that desperate for articles?  His "Story" was an obviously bad
attempt to rationalize his bad behavior in UO.  PKing (or the more
preferred term - mass murdering) will be totally different in EQ then in
UO, and Thumper's story does not fit at all.  It should have gone on an
UO page, and not an EQ.

I am disappointed that you chose to put the article from Thumper on
Pking.  It struck me as a complete diatribe on his woes from UO.  I fail to see
the place it has with respect to Everquest.  I was disappointed by some
aspects of UO and DID choose to quit playing.  I am waiting for something like
EQ.  And yes, one(not the only) reason was Pking.  I do not have the time to
develop a character strong enough to stand against a well developed
player.  I am very happy to see the PK switch for EQ.  It allows both types of
play to flourish.  It is unfortunate that UO did not see it that way.  One
jab: a bunch of powerful characters standing around fluffing their feathers and
trying to provoke one another is NOT role-playing.  I was not there and
did not see the conversions, but from what I read I think my comment
stands.
