	Near the end of the first age, when Veeshan's brood was engaged in vicious battle with the denizens of the Underworld for mastery of the Overworld, the Father of the Kuldar was sorely beset. Having fought dragonkind for a thousand years, and prevailing, but barely, over dragonkind, Kul despaired for his people. He could no longer watch the Kuldar dying under the claws, teeth and breath of Veeshan's brood, and decided to seek out Brell Serilis.
<br><br>
	Kul sought the deepest mine dug by the Devlar, and took with him a mattock and chisel to delve deeper into the underworld, seeking the Chambers of Living Stone. Forty-nine days he dug, chisel against stone, the clanging of the mattock ringing through the mines like the ringing of a tocsin bell, spelling the doom of dragonkind. At the end of the forty-nine days, Kul broke through into a red-hot chamber of stone which moved and breathed as if a living thing. When he put the chisel to this stone, hot lava spurted out, and melted the chisel in his hand.
<br><br>
	Kul began wandering this chamber, ever seeking the Portal to the Plane of Underfoot. As he wandered, strange creatures would peer at him from shadowed tunnels, only to scamper away if he came near. At first, Kul sought out these creatures, but soon realized that these creatures were drawing him away from his goal, as if they knew what he sought. In his anger at his discovery, he slew many, until they bothered him no more.
<br><br>
	On the seventh day of his search, he came to a large stone door. The door was a living thing, with scrollwork and decorations which moved across the frame like a tapestry come to life. Blind eyes looked at him as he examined the odd doorway. The door reached one hundred feet into the room of the chamber, and he knew that this surely must be the doorway of a God.
<br><br>
	Just then, a short portal opened within the door, about 4 feet tall, and a small dwarf came out, and peered at Kul quizzically.
<br><br>
	"I seek Brell Serilis," Kul boomed, "the God of Underfoot."
<br><br>
	The dwarf peered at him some more, and said: "What does Kul the Mighty, victor of a thousand battles, Slayer of the Great Wyrm Mordeethan, wish with such a person?"
<br><br>
	"I seek him, and no other, little person, for only he may grant my wish!" Kul said disdainfully.
<br><br>
	"Oh, you have a wish for him! He hates wishes, Iiii woouldn't doo thaat." The little dwarf shook his head. "You might not like what you get!"
<br><br>
	"Little person, I must have this wish granted, so out of my way!" With this, Kul grabbed the shoulder of the dwarf, and tried to push him out of the way. It was like pushing a mountain, and Kul found he could not let go! In horror, he tried to pull away, when suddenly he was released, and knocked flat on his back.
<br><br>
	The little dwarf snorted, then grew larger, and larger until he filled the doorway. "MUST?" he thundered, "MUST?" WHY SHOULD I DO ANYTHING FOR SUCH AN ARROGANT DWARF? YOU SLAY MY CREATURES, YOU DEFILE MY PORTAL, AND YET YOU DARE SEEK A BOON?"
<br><br>
	Kul got to his knees before Brell, for that is who the little dwarf was. "It is not for me, but for thy people!" he shouted, "we need a weapon to help us defeat the great wyrms, they are killing us. You have given items of power to the Donnar and the Sonndar, but not to the defenders of dwarvenkind, the Kuldar!"
<br><br>
	"I GIVE THOSE ITEMS BECAUSE THEY ARE ITEMS OF CREATION, NOT DESTRUCTION!" Brell boomed, "YOU SEEK TO UNDO ALL THE WORK THE DWARVES HAVE DONE! AND IN YOUR ARROGANCE, YOU THINK TO BE THE SAVIOR AND REAP GLORY FOR THY PEOPLE!" Suddenly, Brell became dwarf-size again. "You will learn why I don't give artifacts of destruction. Here!" With that , a stone bucket full of molten steel suddenly appeared in Kul's hand. Kul almost dropped it from the sudden weight and searing heat, but held on.
<br><br>
	"Take this to Dun, the dwarven Master Smith. He'll know what to do." With that, Brell disappeared, and the portal with him. Kul stood alone, his hands cradling the heavy stone bucket with it's molten contents.
<br><br>
	Kul walked through the caverns of Living stone, trying to keep his way as he returned to the leader of the Donnar. Radiant heat from the molten steel scorched his face and beard, and the stone bucket seared his hands. The steel didn't cool at all, even after several days of travel. From that day forth, the Kuldar all had red beards and ruddy skin, because of the ordeal Kul suffered from that metal.
<br><br>
	Kul carried the bucket across faydwer to Dun's forge, and entered, his strength nearly spent, his hands blackened from the bucket.
<br><br>
	"Here," he shouted to Dun, "Brell gave me this, it's to make a weapon to defend ourselves with!"
<br><br>
	Dun looked at the contents of the bucket, and held his hands over it. "Hang the bucket from this hook, and come back next week" He then turned his burly back to Kul. "get going, your presence isn't needed here… yet."
<br><br>
	For seven days Dun worked the steel, hammering and quenching, binding spells and protections into the living metal. As he worked the metal formed itself, shaping in to a broad-bladed double axe.  Dun was troubled by this, since it seemed that the metal had ideas of it's own.
<br><br>
When Kul returned at the end of the week, Dun showed him the axe. It gleamed in the dim light of the forge with an inner fire. Dun said, "This axe knows why it was made, but I'm not sure I do. It appears, though still warm to the touch, to be able to diffuse heat. I have tested it on the hottest fire I can create, and the holder of the axe was unburned.
<br><br>
	Kul lifted the axe, and lightly spun it. "It has almost no weight!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
	Dun looked surprised. "It seems, then, to have an affinity to you, perhaps even to those of your blood. I can barely lift it. Kul", he warned, I fear this weapon bears a price, a doom which will show itself later."
<br><br>
	"I don't care!" said Kul. "I can fight dragons now, and they can't harm me with their foul breath. Veeshan's whelps will flee from me, and die at my hands!" With that, he hoisted his axe high, and swore a mighty Oath.
<br><br>
	"With this axe I shall slay Veeshan's get, and make the upperworld safe for dwarvenkind!"
<br><br>
Thus ends the tale of the creation of the Axe of Kul. How it was lost is another tale to be told later.

I found this among my earlier writings, and thought I should share it again.  It is a story from the dwarven mythos I created for Everquest. If you like it, let me know, and I'll put some more up.  This story and the others originally appeared on the Consortium, a racial unity site for EQ, which is being re-started.  Look for it soon. - Oghma, Dwarven Loremaster
