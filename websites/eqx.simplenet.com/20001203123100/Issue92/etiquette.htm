<FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">This sure feels like a cheap way to write an article.  Ask people to give their opinions and then fill the article with 'em.  Hardly any work for me.  But I'll do my best to be witty and rational, and to try to fill my word quotient for the week.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">In <a href="../Issue87/etiquette.htm">issue 87</a> I described and experience, a bad one, in which a player broke several 'rules of etiquette'.  It occurred to me near the end of the article (no, I don't plan most of the things I write, I just type and see what comes out - that's why I'm not getting paid to do this) that I probably have a different set of rules than the rest of you do.  And it's not fair to hold someone to rules unless they are either generally agreed upon or are just plain common sense.  So I asked folks to send in any rules that they live buy while playing EverQuest.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I was going to categorize the responses and sort them all into neat little packages, but I'm pretty lazy.  There are a lot of letter, so this article is pretty long.  If you're in some sort of big rush, then you can skip to the bottom and see my summary, a cute little list of etiquette.  Each of you seemed to have very thematic responses, indicating that you see a specific type of thing that bothers you a lot, or have a pet peeve (more on that later).  For example, Galedor sent me the following (and I was kind enough to insert my comments):</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">

<UL>
<LI>If a group of people are shouting an argument across a zone, and you don't want to listen to it, simply turn off shouts/ooc or leave the soon. Shouting at people to keep it to tells (or even to keep it to ooc) simply does not work. Your best bet is to ignore it. </LI></UL>



<UL>
<LI>If there are only two people arguing about something via shouts/ooc, ask politely for them to use a more private means of communication. If this does not work, remember that you can easily ignore them. </LI></UL>


</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">To me it's all a matter of what they are talking about.  First off, I believe anything goes in /ooc, as long as it doesn't break any of the common sense rules about speaking in public, such as vulgarity.  I see no reason to tell people to stop using /ooc, it's sort of the catch-all channel.  Though I do think it's far more polite to take a one-on-one out of character conversation to /tell.  I really don't even see a problem with characters using /shout to hold conversations, after all they are yelling to each other, and taking a yelling match to /tell is out of character.  Though it is also perfectly acceptable for someone to /shout at them to shut up.  Again, as long as it's all in character.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Expecting anyone to turn off /shout or /ooc just to avoid a conversation isn't right.  If the /shouters or /oocers are being vulgar or /shouting out of character, then sending them a /tell asking them to stop <B>is</B> reasonable, after all they are breaking rules of common sense.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">By far your best suggestion is to ignore it.  I have /ooc and /auction turned off, because I'm not interested in out of character conversation.  I use /shout liberally because I am arrogant enough to think that I might entertain and bring some life to those around me (unless I'm playing my Tier'dal, then the reverse is true, bringing Hate and death to those around me).  I've gotten pretty good at ignoring the occasional out of character /shout.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">It's also a good idea to make your first assumption a good one.  So if someone is calling you names, it's likely that they are talking to your character, not you.  And even if they are, stay in character and respond.  Keep it in character and you'll enjoy playing a lot more.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">

<UL>
<LI>Do not shout for SoW or buffs. As a shaman, I refuse to cast SoW on anyone who shouts or simply asks around without seeing who is about. If you want an SoW, check the /who listing for either a shaman or a druid (or even a ranger if they're old enough), and ask them privately. </LI></UL>


</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Absor /shouts There are no pigs here!  Head out to Halas, I've heard everyone there owns one!</P>
</I>
<p style="text-align: justify">Or something like that.  I agree, all this shouting about SoW bugs me.  Two of my pet peeves in one annoying yell.  First, I don't really like abbreviations when talking in a role-playing game.  It's lazy and it's not likely that your character actually yells &quot;S. o. W.&quot;  The other peeve is, well, how many fifth level characters would already know that there is such a spell, much less that it's called Spirit of the Wolf?  </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">*shrug*</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I did like a Troll (Ogre?  Never got close enough to find out) that I heard recently yelling for &quot;Dat spell dat make me go fast soz I kan gets to me corpse&quot; or something like that.  At least he avoided my pet peeves…</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">

<UL>
<LI>Keep items that are being sold to the /auction channel. Do not use the /ooc channel, or the shout channel. It will simply get people mad. </LI></UL>


</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Well, I agree and I disagree.  I certainly agree that /ooc is not the place for auctions.  However, I will only sell things with /shout.  Obviously because I have /auction turned off.  But to me /shout is a perfectly good thing to do if you want people to hear that you have something to sell.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">

<UL>
<LI>Do not spam. In my opinion, a person who spams should have their flag switched to a new setting, PVP-ALL (Where anyone, PvP+ or PvP-, can attack them). </LI></UL>


</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">*smiles*  Yup!  I completely agree.  I can't imagine why someone would spam out the same auction every fifteen seconds for five minutes.  I asked one guy once, and he told me that new people were coming into the zone all the time, and he didn't want to miss any…  the zone must have been a lot busier in his personal universe than in the one the rest of us were in.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Spam is bad, in any form.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">

<UL>
<LI>Try to keep the ooc comments ooc, and vice-versa. I don't mind the occasional slip, but eventually it becomes absurd. </LI></UL>


</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Agreed, wholeheartedly.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">

<UL>
<LI>Expect to be ignored if your name is Tampon. (I am serious; there was a high elf on the PVP server with this name. He was quickly deleted). </LI></UL>


</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Expect to be ignored and <B>reported</B>!</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">Galedor, Barbarian Shaman of Tarew Marr</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Thanks Galedor.  I get the feeling that the two major areas where etiquette comes to loggerheads with laziness or expedience are chatting and killing things.  Galedor seems to have covered a lot of the chat stuff, but what about the killing things part?</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">Here are a few I've picked up/violated:</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">1) If you think someone needs help, ask (in character, even!). If things seem to dire for that, help in a non-kill-stealing manner (heal the PC, Root the monster that is chasing them). It's hard to get accused of kill-stealing when you are not damaging the monster. Also, if you help the PC escape, the monster will often turn on you and you can legitimately get experience for it. :)</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Well, some classes don't have any real non-lethal options for helping.  Monks, warriors, bards, rogues...  these folks can't heal, root or buff a character to help out.  I agree, in any case where your help is not immediately needed, always ask.  But I think I have to disagree with you in the case of dire situations.  If you know that the person is in dire need, help first, talk later.  I would hate to have someone die because I lingered.  And I would rather be called names (assuming I'm playing a helpful character) and save someone, than watch them die while waiting for them to respond to my question.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I think the burden here is on the one being helped.  If someone helps you, recognize it, and thank them.  If you were in the dire circumstance then you should be grateful to be alive, and not angry because your savior stole your kill.  In reality it's just as likely that he stole the kill from the monster...</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">2) Create "I need help!" and "I don't need help, thank you!" macros with appropriate in-character text, and use them when someone is hovering around your fight. For those snooty, too-badass-to-ask-for-help types, use an emote ("Drizzlt is in deep trouble, but his pride prevents him from requesting any.").</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Not a bad idea.  Though my snooty characters wouldn't even look like they were in trouble...</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">3) Always keep your cool. Getting angry and letting it show just makes you look bad and satisfies anyone who is trying to get a rise out of you.  Responding with maturity and cheerful good humor usually gets a better result. If you are so angry that you can't keep your cool, you probably need to take a break.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Great!  Well said.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">4) Don't bind people who don't want to be bound! (Dashanna, many thanks for the language lessons, but now I'm stuck in freakin' Freeport, grumble grumble.)</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Air your pet peeves!  I'm going to.  :)</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">5) High-elf wizards are your friends, always give them as much gold and items as you can possibly afford. :)</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">No comment...</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Thanks Geoff.  Good points.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">In your article this week, you asked for suggestions for EQ Etiquette.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I have run into quite a few problems on EQ, however, I am willing to bet many of them have to do with inexperienced or young players who are used to just playing hack and slash games like Doom.  I'll list them anyway...</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I play on the Cazic-Thule server, which is where these things have happened:</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I've seen this one on some chat message boards:  People killing a spawn "out of turn."  I've not had this problem, as I'm only a 5th level paladin (a high elf named Ahlarra -- say hi if you ever see me!), but friends of mine that are higher level have had this problem.  They have gone to wait for a creature to spawn, spoken to other people also waiting for the spawn and worked out a fighting order, and then had someone just jump into the area when the creature spawns and snag the kill.  If it's all right to do this, then why bother waiting in the area patiently?  It's not fair when someone does jump in.  Everyone else is trying to be fair, what makes these people the exception?</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">While I am not a fan of the whole scene that you describe, I do believe that if you are going to make yourself a part of the camping system then you should follow the prescribed etiquette.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">Also, in fighting on the orc hill, I had a situation similar to yours.  I saw someone fighting an oracle, and she only had a little bit of life left and the oracle was still quite healthy.  Seeing as I had grouped with this character previously and she even helped me find my body the first time I'd died, I thought I would help.  I jumped in to help without asking if she needed it because she was close to dying.  Then I see the shouts: </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">"Get off!"</P>
<p style="text-align: justify">"It's MY kill!"</P>
<p style="text-align: justify">"Leave it alone!"</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">So, I responded stating that I was sorry and was just trying to help.  She never responded or anything.  And wouldn't you know it, she died moments later.  Big shock.  Felt good though.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">In a case like this you did the best you could, and handled yourself properly.  Though you should feel a little guilty about being happy over her death... a little.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">The other problem I had on the orc hill is that my group would pull one or two centurions (no problem for our group of five), and someone else who was hanging out on the hill alone would jump into our fight.  EVERY time.  The same guy!!!  The worst thing is, I was in a group of levels 4 - 8 and this guy was conning red to a 6th level enchanter.  So he was higher level than us.  And he was stealing our kills.  I wasn't really caring about the money or the items, but the experience.  I was trying to make 5th that night.  And, only a bubble and a half away from it, it took me over 2 hours in a group of 5 who was constantly killing orcs because this guy stole almost one third of our kills.  I finally asked him, via tell, to stop stealing our kills, named the people in our group, and let him know we didn't appreciate him jumping the kills on us.  He still stuck around for another half hour or so.  When I asked him to stop it again, he finally did.  But he never apologized.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Well, he did stop.  And that's good.  This seems to be a good time to point out that there are some real rules that get involved here, not just etiquette.  One instance of kill stealing is acceptable.  So are several.  But had the enchanter continued to steal kills from your group after you asked him to stop, it would have been within your rights to petition about it.  Kill stealing is considered wrong if you do it to the same person or group for long enough to call it harassment.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">Also, that same night, there was a lvl 5 ranger in our group.  He was not helping us much with kills, but he sure was looting them all.  We had to tell him three times to wait his turn to loot.  The message finally got through when our leader told him to wait his turn or get kicked out of the group.  He got better then, but it should never have happened in the first place!  Then, to top it all off, after a particularly hard fight, one of our members was close to death and I couldn't get to him in time to lay hands, but at the end of the fight, the ranger was very low on life, so I laid hands on him.  Not a minute later, he left the group!  And five minutes after that, our group leader died.  Had he told me he was leaving, I would have saved my lay hands for someone else.  I feel like I wasted an ability that I can only do every once in a while.  In fact, I still can't use lay hands because I haven't been on long enough since I used it on him.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Recently I was playing with some Dorfs I know.  We had the opposite problem, we were all too nice to each other and nobody would be so presumptuous as to loot before the others.  You bring up another area, group etiquette.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">I find that there is a serious lack of respect for others on EQ.  There is no consideration.  It's really disheartening.  That's also why I rarely group with anyone and why it's taking me so long to advance.  However, at least this way, I don't have to deal with people who don't know how to be courteous.  Although, I do have to say, because I don't want to deal with people like this, it has kept me from playing EQ nightly like some form of crack.  I play maybe once or twice a week.  So at least I have a life outside of the game...</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I have met some really nice people in game.  Only a few, but they are out there.  I just hope that my experiences have been the exception rather than the rule.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">There are a few of us out there that are nice.  In fact, I'd say that there are a lot of us.  The problem is that it only takes a few to piss off the rest.  A very important part of EverQuest etiquette is to not let them bother you, and don't take their silliness out on others.  And don't let the bad guys drive you from the game.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">Mary E. Overmeyer</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Thanks Mary.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hi there! This is for Absor in reference to his "Etiquette" article.  Here's my not-so-favorite list of EQ pet-peeves.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">#1: Examining someone's equipment without permission. If you're curious, just ask! But quit checking me out! It makes my skin crawl! I even have a new macro - :grimaces and move away, shouting "Stop touching me!!"</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">We disagree here.  I've had this discussion many times with various folks on various newsgroups, and I'm willing to bet that the playing population is just about evenly split on this issue.  You have to realize that by 'inspecting' you someone is only seeing what you have on.  Because of the limitations of the game, other players have no idea if you are wearing a cloak at all, much less what kind.  Examining you should not be considered and intrusion, it's just casually looking you over.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">However, because it does bother about half of the population so much, my rule is not to do it.  (Well, except for that time in beta when there was this guy that had obviously been twinked and I wanted to see what he had, so a followed him around invisible and kept examining him...  but that's different... really...).</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">#2: Spelling!!!! The word is "you." y-o-u. NOT "u". Or "are" not "r".  Also, the letter z in place of s, as in "anywayz". grrrrr......</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">I completely agree.  Major pet peeve.  As an editor I figure I'm more sensitive to it.  Especially people who insist on using a lot of exclamation points, somehow thinking that it will emphasize their point more than just one, but not realizing that it detracts from their point...  :)</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">#3: Swearing profusely. I shouldn't have to filter people out, especially as it filters such innocuous words such as "bastard" (always a good insult in RP) and "damn".</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Certainly, and it falls under the rules of just plain common sense.  It shocks me to see how easily people do things on the net that they would never do at home.  There is an art to cursing someone out without actually using foul language.  I consider it lazy to curse.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">#4: Being OOC in /shout, including but not limited to references to levels, servers, stats, or anything having to do specifically with the outside world.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Also agreed, and we covered this pretty well in the first letter, so that's all I'll say here.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">#5: When in a large crowd, say, at a party, do not try to raise your alcohol tolerance by drinking 500 honey meads in a row! Ever since they put in that thrice-damned "Glug, glug..." message (who glugs brandy, wine, or champagne anyway?!?), the spam is *awful*.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Well...  I'm not sure I can agree with you on this one.  Have you ever tried to drink that much?  It's truly an accomplishment, and the spam is well earned.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">#6: Begging constantly, when you really *aren't* down on your luck and just looking for an easy road.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Agreed.  Really too obvious to comment on.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">#7: Constant spellcasting in front of people (ie. making a ton of food and water in the bank). It's laggy, the noise gets on your nerves, etc.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Good point.  Continuous spell casting in meeting places is rude.  People are trying to talk, and you're splattering them with flecks of light and text.  Move your silly casting to a less populated area, not the front gates of Qeynos.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">#8: Pushing in front of someone's face in the bank. It's pretty annoying to have someone's face polygons fill your screen.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Applies anywhere.  In tight spaces, though, you have to give some allowance.  Some bank areas are tiny and just to get to the teller someone might have to invade your space.  Add to this, don't sit around in popular 'working' areas just to chat or fiddle with your inventory.  Move on outside and cut down on the crowding.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">#9: Generally disrespecting people! This goes for everyday life as well, but if someone's trying to hold a concert or a wedding, or some other sort of event, it's very disrespectful to stage jump, talk out loud constantly, make "Glug, glug..." noises, make jokes, insult people. Of course not kill-stealing, harassing, etc. falls under this category as well.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Respect your fellows.  Probably rule number one.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">Whew! I had more pet peeves than I thought! Have fun, and hope this sums some of em up for you!</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hiya's  :)  I'd like to comment on your article regarding etiquette in Norrath.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Jump right in!</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">First, let me offer my background in online gaming.  In addition to a couple of muds, I've been playing/beta testing online multiplayer graphical games since 1991.  I've also been an online gaming sysop (aka Guide) for over 6 years.  I'm also a 35+ year old female professional and mother.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Now, my comment.  You were wrong in jumping in to assist the halfling unless (1) he asked for help; (2) you checked his health and the monster's health to see if he needed help; or (3) you asked if he needed help and let him respond.  Instead, you assumed he needed or wanted it, and imposed your assumption on him by your actions.  By imposing your assumption, you stepped into his fight.  By my understanding of etiquette in general, and of online gaming etiquette, that was rude and inconsiderate, and a breach of etiquette.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">Perhaps.  However I was only one of four that acted.  Also, all of us stopped fighting when he got angry with us.  He could have continued his fight, at no loss to himself, and we would have gone on with our lives.  I do NOT believe that I should take the time that it can take in a crowded place to try to discover the victims health.  By then it could be too late.  However, in no case will three or four sword swings on monsters that are my equal or better (something I knew upon sight of them) cause any harm to the victim.  If he had simply said, &quot;thanks, I got them,&quot; I would have gone back to my resting.  He chose to see me as a villain, and he chose to be rude to me.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">I am not at all certain how I could have caused him the slightest harm, and I could only have done him good.  I could not have stolen his kill, and would have stopped before such a thing happened.  While I understand the knee-jerk reaction that has most people assuming that anyone that jumps in on a fight is trying to do them harm.  But that's foolish, and leads to anger, strife and rudeness.  His assumption should have been that I was trying to help.  He should have just told me that he could handle it, and all would have been well.  And, well, he couldn't have handled them...</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">Now, his reaction was also rude and unwarranted.  But please understand, many kill stealers attempt to justify their KSing behavior by offering the explanation, "I was just trying to help you" (usually when the victim of the KS had no desire or need for the assist).</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">I understand that.  But there really are not that many kill stealers.  And to assume that everyone is does an injustice to them, yourself, and the game as a whole.  The paranoid attitude is very harmful.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">Using how I play one of my chars as an example, I frequently group, and as a result, don't get the chance to get all my skills up to level.  So, on occasion, I go off solo to find a low blue to work on my skills and to work on bind wounds.  It's a safe fight for me, I know what I'm doing, and I want my HP to get down as low as possible for binding practice.  But every heal given me, every hit someone takes on that monster, takes away from my purpose.  If they ask first, I am given the opportunity to thank them for the offer, but explain my purpose.  If they simply step into the fray, they are taking away from my goals and forcing me to play solo longer to accomplish my goals.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">I understand.  But how harmful are they being, I mean really?  You can always run out and find another blue monster to fight.  The worst harm they've done you is to slow down your practice.  What they have given you is worth more, and that's a helping hand.  They've been nice to you, and you really should see it that way.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">Yes, the halfling was out of line in how he reacted to your "help", but he was not out of line in expecting the courtesy of you to ask first.  I do believe that your motives were pure, and that indeed, you did want to help the halfing.  For that, you should be appreciated and thanked.  But, you should also appreciate that it was his fight, and his choice to get assistance, or not.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Since you are in a position of reaching many players of EQ, I don't want the impression left with those players that its proper etiquette to assume that one can step into any fight on the basis of "helping".  That seems to be the most abused "excuse" for ill behavior that I've seen used in EQ.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">I agree, that should never be used as an excuse.  But you I would really hate to think that those few sour people could make the rest of us paranoid and hateful.  I would much rather lose a kill to a helpful person a hundred times next week than just one time be angry at someone for trying to help, just because they might be a nasty kill stealer.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#000080">
<p style="text-align: justify">p.s.  You did right in letting the halfling die the second time... &lt;wink&gt;</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><p style="text-align: justify">I appreciate your comments.  I'm not trying to argue with you just to argue (and besides, you can't really respond to my comments).  I really do think that it is a bad thing to be angry at someone for doing something that like this.  A person could be helping, he could be stealing.  It is so much better to assume that he's helping and avoid the anger and negativity that comes from a false assumption.  There's a very tight line here, where being helpful can become being rude.  And with most other characters, and in most other situations I would have asked if he needed help, or just laughed as he died (I mentioned that I play a Tier'Dal, right?)  But Absor is a nice guy, and he hates elementals - he also knew that the elementals were higher level than the character fighting them.  In this one case, I'm very sure that I was on the right side of that line.  But I also realize how easy it is to cross it.  And probably next time Absor will hold back and evaluate the situation more closely.  I just hope that it doesn't cause someone to die.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">How about Absor's Guide to Etiquette in Norrath.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">First the four <B>General Principles of EverQuest Etiquette</B>:</P>

<OL>

<U><LI>Respect your fellow player.</U>  Behind every player character in Norrath is a real person.  And people deserve respect.  Your Fier'Dal Paladin will respect that Teir'Dal Cleric, but you should respect the Cleric's player, even if that requires a quick /tell to them to explain &quot;Hi, nice to meet you.  I'm only role-playing, don't take this personally.&quot;</LI>
<U><LI>Stay Calm.</U>  Don't accuse.  Don't yell.  Sure, it might make you feel better in the short term, but it doesn't help the situation.  Those that are breaking etiquette on purpose (or without concern) won'' care how mad you get.  Some thrive on making people angry.  And someone that didn't know that he was being rude will respond far better to a kind explanation then to yelling.  Remember, this game really is a community.</LI>
<U><LI>Assume the best.</U>  People make mistakes.  Some people see things differently.  And sometimes it's possible that both of you are right.  If you allow your first impression to be a good one you will enjoy the game a lot more.  And because of you're having fun and being positive, so will others.</LI>
<U><LI>Some things are never 'in-character'</U>.  It may seem in character for a Troll Shadowknight to stir up all the denizens of Unrest and drag them around, causing the deaths of dozens of lightbringers and happy Bards.  It's not.  Not because it's not something that the character would do, maybe he would.  But because it angers the other players, not their characters.  In a way it's an abuse of the switch.  The good guys that are killed in this way have no way to prevent it, nor to deal with the cause.  It's probably not in character for a Paladin to retaliate with the same maneuver.  And he can't just kill the Shadowknight unless he will accept a duel.  Some things transcend the game and affect the players.  Don't do those things and then claim that you were being in character, because you were not trying to piss of the character, you were trying to piss of the player.  Of course being a victim of rule 4 should never make you forget rules 1 - 3.</LI></OL>

<U>
</U><B><p style="text-align: justify">Specific Rules of Etiquette:</P>
</B>
<I><p style="text-align: justify">Group Etiquette:</P>
</I>
<p style="text-align: justify">When you join a group, you become part of a little society.  You really do need to learn enough about them so that you don't break their social customs.  When you first join a group it's a good idea to ask a few questions out of character to find out how they do looting and what their goals are.  Here are some basics:</P>


<UL>
<U><LI>Loot in the order set up.</U>  If there is a looting order, follow it.  Don't bother being greedy.  People remember, and if they're your peers now, they will likely continue to be your peers.  You lose more by angering them in the long run than you do by swiping a few gold from them in the short term.</LI>
<U><LI>Role-play with your group.</U>  If you find yourself in a group that role-plays, even if you generally do not, then do your best to join in.  You may find that it's fun.  But don't be excruciatingly out of character.</LI>
<U><LI>Don't role-play with your group</U>.  The converse is also true.  If you find yourself in a group that is only interested in gaining experience and stuff, then do as they do.  Try not to let your role-playing cause a situation that gets them killed.  For example, as a bard it is very hard to chat and weave songs.  My fingers are pretty busy just keeping the songs up.  In my normal groups I'll lose a few spell beats to rip a few good in character jokes.  But in a power-gaming group I keep all of my chatter to down times.</LI>
<U><LI>If unhappy, leave the group.</U>  If you are in a group that you don't like, leave.  Be polite about it.  Explain to them why you feel the need to leave.  If you are in a tough spot stay until they can replace you or until you are in a safe spot.  And if someone tells you that they are leaving the group and why, don't get mad at them.  They are being honest.  And you'd rather play with people that share your goals, right?</LI>
<U><LI>Groups are bigger than just the people you see on the little list on your screen.</U>  Apply all of these rules to the larger group, those in the same zone.</LI></UL>


<I><p style="text-align: justify">Chat Etiquette:</P>
</I>
<p style="text-align: justify">The first thing to do is list the uses of each channel.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">/say is for talking to those near you.  It is an in character channel.</P>
<p style="text-align: justify">/shout is for, well, shouting.  It spans the entire zone, and is an in character channel.</P>
<p style="text-align: justify">/ooc spans an entire zone.  It is an out of character channel</P>
<p style="text-align: justify">/auction spans the entire zone.  It is only for selling items.</P>
<p style="text-align: justify">/tell is to a specific person.  It's use as out of character or in character is entirely up to the two people involved.  Reaches anyplace in Norrath.</P>
<p style="text-align: justify">/gsay conveys messages only to your group.  It can be used as in character or out of character chat.</P>
<p style="text-align: justify">/guildsay conveys messages to your entire guild.  It can be used as in character or out of character chat.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">First let me comment about the channels that can be either in or out of character.  To me, and to most of the people I know, /tell and /gsay are always out of character channels.  It's just not to easy to explain how you chat silently with one person anywhere in the world, or how you chat to only these four people while standing among a few dozen.  Though one person I know that will emote <I>/em whispers to Absor</I> and then use a /tell.  Inventive and a nice way of putting /tell to use for us role-players.</P>


<UL>
<U><LI>No vulgarity</U>.  All of us can survive the occasional curse word.  And if you're with a group that knows you, curse all you want over /gsay.  But be brave and learn how to verbally abuse someone without resorting to vulgarity, it's an art form that is under appreciated in EverQuest.</LI>
<U><LI>Try to consider others when chatting.</U>  When using /shout remember that everyone in the zone hears you.  While I don't think that all one on one conversations have to be done in /tell, if you really seem to be bothering people with your shouting, stop.</LI>
<U><LI>Don't chat out of character on in character channels.</LI>
<LI>Don't spam</U>, even if it's in character.</LI>
<U><LI>Don't get upset</U>.  Remember your /ignore feature.</LI></UL>


<I><p style="text-align: justify">Combat Etiquette:</P>

</I><p style="text-align: justify">Try to keep in mind that combat can be very hectic.  Stuff happens in a battle that is hard to sort out at the time, or even later.  Keep calm…</P>


<UL>
<U><LI>Ask first</U>.  Ask if someone wants help before jumping in.  And ask for help if you need it, don't expect it.</LI>
<U><LI>Observe spawn camping order</U>.  As much as I hate that it has come to such a thing (and I'll leave before getting involved in such a thing), respect the order.  Get in line with the rest.  Just like in group situations, being rude for a small gain now isn't worth the trouble and hard feelings it causes later.</LI>
<U><LI>Don't steal kills</U>.  Don't do it.  But don't assume that everyone that attacks <I>your</I> monster is trying to steal it.  With lag and poor framerates it is certainly possible that you both attacked it first.</LI>
<U><LI>Trains happen</U>.  Most of the time they are due to poor planning, unexpected events, and just plain bad luck.  Don't get mad about them.  But try your best not to cause them.  And scream like a little girl when you find a few dozen enemies beating on you as you flee.  Give warning and you might get the help you need to make it to the zone.</LI></UL>


<I><p style="text-align: justify">Social Etiquette:</P>
</I>
<p style="text-align: justify">I know, a bit repetitive, but what can I say.  Being social should require that you understand and obey the rules of etiquette for the given situation.  This is sort of my catch-all category.</P>


<UL>
<U><LI>Don't inspect people without asking.</U>  Even though I personally see nothing wrong with it, I also know that it upsets some people.  So don't do it.  This is one of those cases of upsetting the player and not the character.</LI>
<U><LI>Don't Spam.</U>  There are all sorts of spam in EverQuest.  Repeated spell casting, repeating chat messages, repeated actions that give emotes (like drinking), and I'm sure others that I've forgotten.  In some cases it's a good thing.  Like when my Dorf pals and I get together, we make it a point to let people know that we spend all of our cash on alcohol.  But it you are going to do something repeatedly (like casting for practice), move to an isolated location for the sake of those around you.  And, no matter how important your point is to you, nobody wants to see it over and over again.</LI>
<U><LI>Don't stand so close to me.</U>  Oddly enough even in EverQuest we seem to have a concept of personal space.  So if you can help it, don't stand on top of people.  Give them an arm's length or more.</LI></UL>

<U>
</U><p style="text-align: justify">Enough of this prattle.  I suspect this will be a case of preaching to the initiated.  Those that are social will nod their heads and agree (with perhaps a few exceptions).  Those that like to rattle the cage or that are more interested in expedience over etiquette just won't care.  But I feel better for doing this, and hopefully I've helped out some.</P>
