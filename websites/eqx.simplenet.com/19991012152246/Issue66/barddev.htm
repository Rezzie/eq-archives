Grey walls tower'd above her, a sharp cry, a blackened door --<br>
She shivered in the cold wind and then, she spotted Tanidor.<br>
Warmth started to suffuse her, as it spread from limb to limb<br>
And her batting eyelashes flirted, focusing only in on him.<br>
She laid her arm o'er his elbow, resting fingers on his wrist,<br>
He smiled and ponderingly asked, "Should I add a little mist?<br>
Snuggling close along his torso, she followed him inside --<br>
Murm'ring sweet nothings to him 'til the dungeon she spied.<br>
She shrieked, she jumped, clamb'ring to his shoulders above,<br>
As he analyzed the scene and said "More orcs here, my love?"
<br><br>
Slowly dropping to the floor, breathing heavily in fear, <br>
She gathered her determination and nibbled at his ear<br>
Whispering to him oh so softly, "Tanidor, now we have some time."<br>
Then watched him kneeling to the stone asking "Should I add some slime?"<br>
She slipped her fingers into his, skin warm and soft and moist,<br>
But he moved along to set the trap - a heavy falling joist.<br>
She ran her fingers through his hair, and landed a loving peck,<br>
As he stretched his arms across the hall to find  "The perfect bottleneck."
<br><br>
And so it went, room after room, her heart was so aroused,<br>
As they stepped into the cavelike hall where seductresses caroused.<br>
Surely, she thought, taking his hand to start a sweet and lovely waltz,<br>
My lips must now attract him more than his list of zonal faults.<br>
The music played, time slipped away, as she was encircled by his arms.<br>
She thought, at last, twas worth the wait, now he'll enjoy my charms.<br>
Alas, alas, it was not to be, as she pressed herself against him,<br>
He twirled her away, turning her face to a dangling bloodsoaked limb.<br> 
He smiled, then waltzed her further on, grinning at her delight,<br>
Ah Sweet, please next observe my perfect dolerite.<br>
The rocks, the stones, the swords and shields, the monsters in this zone<br>
Everything now in readiness for rampaging testosterone
<br><br>
At that he smirked, grabbed her arms, and crushed her to his face,<br>
His lips so sweet, his eyes aglow, sweeping her into his embrace.<br>
She swooned and gasped, praying that his tinkering would cease,<br>
As Tanidor then declared,  "Just one more ghoul before release."
