<B>Please Note:</B> EverQuest Express is not the official voice of Verant
Interactive, makers of EverQuest.  We cannot answer questions about payment 
methods, hardware requirements (i.e. video cards), or technical details about 
the game.  This Q&A is meant to cover gameplay issues only.  Thank you for 
understanding.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Is it possible to max out all skills on each level by repeatedly dying (on purpose) and training?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> No.  If you die and regain a level you had already previously attained, you will not gain additional free training points.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> If you discover armor as booty, is it a one-size-fits-all approach or is it meant only for a specific race?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Armor is divided into three sizes: small, medium, and large.  Obviously gnomes would wear small armor, while ogres would wear large armor.  The other races are split amongst these sizes as well.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Do werewolves and vampires exist within Norrath?  If so, is it possible to contract lycanthropy or vampirism a la Daggerfall?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> There are werewolves, but no such transformation diseases exist in the game.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Are all the combination classes equally penalized?  For instance, do rangers and shadow knights advance in levels at the same rate?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Every race and class is balanced individually.  The specific penalties are subject to change at any time during beta or even in release, so which has the higher penalties is up to the developers.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Will PKs get some experience for killing another player?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> They do not gain any experience at this time, and are only able to loot a single item off the corpse of their fallen prey.  PK will not reap the godlike rewards in other, lesser-balanced games, but deaths still cause you to lose experience.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Do you think the game will be bug-free by final release?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> I am a software developer by trade, and I can say with total confidence that no major software application is bug-free.  In a game the size of EverQuest with so many interactions between players, AI, and game code, there is bound to be lots of bugs even well into final.  This is an unavoidable truth that consumers will need to accept.  However, for those of us in the beta phases, it is our job to seek out, identify, and report all bugs.  By doing this, hopefully bugs that adversely affect the fun and gameplay will be fixed before release.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Will there be some way to elect town officials and an upper class?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Nothing like that is supported by the game.  Although citizens of a particular town can RP whatever scenarios they like.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Will quests be available for rogues that involve burglary, kidnapping, extortion or murder?  Or are the quests geared more to traditional "Save the Princess" and "Collect the Magical Gem" type quests.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> There are indeed quests that will be available through your guild NPCs.  As quests are being added all the time, I would expect to eventually see some of these illegal activities being rewarded by the rogue guild.  However, I haven't seen anything that extreme so far.  

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> In truth, what portion of the people in beta actually stay in-character?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> There are a good number of players who role play their parts, whether only when they think of something to RP, or remaining in character all the time.  Typically the OOC (out of character) channel, the party channel, and tells are not role played at all.  I also think that because it is beta and there are a lot of OOC influences (bugs, reboots, patches, etc), it hampers the feeling of realism.  However, with the racial hometowns, huge world, and quests, it is hard not to become immersed in your character.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Will you be able to dye armor different colors?  How about making designs on them like stripes (just an example)?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> There is nothing like this at this time.  In a 2D world, it is simple to change the colors on a sprite and paste it to the screen.  However, EverQuest is a completely 3D engine, and requires all textures and rendering to be done on a machine that meets the minimum published requirements.  As such, the amount of display memory is limited.  This means there are only so many textures that you can store in memory before your performance begins to degrade.  If Quake-style skins were implemented, it would require stuffing more textures into memory, which would either degrade performance or make you cut back on textures for other objects.  Not everyone will be running that dual 12MB Voodoo2 setup. 

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> I've seen screenshots of characters with face and/or body art. How does this work?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> These are the default body models and selectable faces.  For example, barbarians have noticeable face paint in many designs (five for males and five for females).  However, there is no way to create your own designs for this.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> What are the disadvantages of being a halfling?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Although not widely known, halflings have many problems that they would rather not be made public.  You may notice the unsightly hair covering the tops of their wide, flat feet.  Not only repulsive to their females, some poor halflings have a disease called Hyperpedofoliclia.  This results in excessive hair growth on the feet.  So much, in fact, that unless regularly trimmed, it can overwhelm the feet and legs of the halfling, causing repeated tripping and falling on one's face.  If that wasn't bad enough, the hair patches so close to the ground are the preferred latching point for many varieties of ticks and fleas.  You may notice halfling PCs or NPCs doing the Rivervale Shuffle, where it looks like they are bouncing side-to-side or running like crazed madmen around in circles.  This is their way of trying to fling the wretched insects off their abnormal feet.  So rest assured, halflings are not just cute little forest creatures. If you think lyme disease is bad, just imagine what you could catch from a halfling.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> How are emotes going to be handled?  Will all be a mere text message, or are there some emotes which will be graphically acted out on screen?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> All emotes will be sent as a text message.  There are also some built in commands that trigger graphical actions, including wave and cheer.  I assume more of these will be added over time as well.
