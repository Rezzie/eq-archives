This guide was designed to introduce you to the rudimentary's of the Barbarian's native tongue.  Like many things in this world climate and society has a grand impact over time not only on our person but on our languages as well.  Despite the Erudin scholar Shietzar's firm assertions that Barbarians are most likely a different race entirely and cannot even remotely be considered cousin to humans, there can be no doubt that their language is firmly rooted in our own Common tongue.  Their remote and isolated area for population has no doubt played a heavy hand in causing the Common Language to slowly degrade.  Their obvious lack of even the average human's intellect and their harsh climate has most likely caused such emphasis to be placed on other areas, like survival, instead of mental expansion.  If you look at the Barbarian's architecture you will notice their city Halas encompasses sheer raw beauty and power, yet everything has a functional purpose.  They do not waste wood, nor skin, nor brick for merely art's sake.
<br><br>
This fact is painfully reflected in the average Barbarian's mode of speech.  While you may encounter a more versed Barbarian, this is usually due to training at a young age with their tribal leaders or ones of their race who are widely traveled.  This is not because they are the norm.  Yet even a well-spoken Barbarian is rather difficult to listen to as their accent is full slurring.  If they are not dropping a vowel in the wrong place they are adding a consonant where none is needed.  In fact, while studying their dialect I have often heard my colleagues remark that being in Halas is a ritual in self-abuse and not just because it's cold.  This guide cannot shelter you from the sounds their throats create nor shelter you from the cold, it will however give you a rude beginning to understand given directions towards the nearest fire or where to buy a blanket.
<br><br>
To begin, you will need a rudimentary break down of the more basic terms used.  When reading the following keep in mind some words in Barbarian sounds very much like Common, though sometimes it has a very different spelling.

Using the table above for reference, we will begin to form basic sentences and greetings, such as they are, in Barbarian.  By studying the following you will be able to have a fundamental understanding of how the Barbarian language differs, but not to greatly, from Common.

If you make yourself familiar with the above and you will be able to navigate Halas, find shelter, food, water, know when danger is near, where to hunt and how to find someone to attend your wounds.  Once you feel comfortable with these essentials and if you're staying in Barbarian territory longer than a night, I highly recommend my second book.  The next book is a more in depth language guide for those who might have to converse at length with a Barbarian.  It is entitled, <em>Conversations past Hi ya's: A Common to Barbarian Guide</em>
