The wiry elven ranger crawled to the top of the hill and carefully peeked
over the top, then turned and furtively gestured for his companion to
follow.  Significantly less agile, the old wizard made his way to the top of
the hill and looked over it's crest at the carnage spread about the road.
<br><br>
"It is as I said, yes?" asked the ranger, his voice barely louder than the
wind across the tall grasses of Karana.
<br><br>
"It is indeed, my young friend," sighed Ozymandius.  Once more, the wizard
cursed his oath of non-interference and pondered the consequences of
breaking it.  Shuddering slightly and sighing again... "caught between the
proverbial rock and a hard place."
<br><br>
"It appears clear...come" and the ranger stood and moved down the hill.
Once beyond ten feet, he was barely visible among the grasses, even though the
wizard was carefully watching him.  At twenty feet, the elf was virtually invisible.
Only when the ranger stepped from the grasses into the burnt clearing was he
visible again.  The aged wizard made his way down the hillside, the stink of
the smoke and charred bodies bringing tears to his eyes and giving his gorge
considerable incentive to exit his body messily.
<br><br>
The ranger crouched down and began inspecting the ground, moving quickly but
deliberately around the camp, searching for tracks and signs that were
imperceptible to those not trained in those arts.  Ozymandius stepped
carefully over the burning debris, seeking survivors though he knew there
were none.  Picking up broken boxes and crates, he could see that the Gnolls
had done a thorough job of ravaging the caravan, leaving nothing but carrion
behind, and even that so poorly mutilated that it was near impossible to
identify the bodies.
<br><br>
"Ozymandius!" called the ranger from behind a set of wagons.  "You might
wish to see this."
<br><br>
The wizard walked that direction, giving the bodies of the horses a wide
berth.  "Yes, Belegedhel?  What did you..." his voice cut off by his
reaction to the horror before him.  Staked to the ground, spread eagle and
face up, was the body of a cruelly vivisected High Elf.  The ranger squatted
over the body, viewing abjectly with a confused expression on his narrow
face while the wizard tried desperately to control his urge to defecate.
<br><br>
"This makes no sense.  Why do this?  This is not the way of the Gnolls.
They strike, take what they need, and leave.  That is the pattern and the
pattern is not to be broken."  The elf stood and regarded Ozymandius
levelly, confusion still evident on his face.
<br><br>
"That is because there is a new kink in the pattern, my friend.  A kink that
I feel bodes ill for the good peoples of Norrath."  Ozymandius sighed.  "I
must return to Qeynos.  Do you require...transportation?"
<br><br>
Belegedhel shook his head fervently.  "I travel by foot, or not at all.
Good journey to you, and may your path be ever long and untraceable."  At
that, the ranger turned and trod off, vanishing into the tall plains
grasses.
<br><br>
The wizard reached out into the air and inscribed runes with his hands, his
fingertips glowing bright blue as a sphere appeared about him.  Casting a
spell that he has cast a thousand times before, the sphere flashed
brilliantly, then vanished, taking the wizard with it.
<br><br>
Several days travel to the west, the sphere grew from a small speck to a
man-sized globe that glowed brightly, then faded, leaving the tall Erudite
wizard standing there to let his vision adjust to the evening lighting.
<br><br>
"Halt in the name of Antonius Bayle!" the Sergeant of the gate shouted
formally.  "Identify yourself!"
<br><br>
"Ozymandius the Traveler, and there is no need to shout, Sergeant, I'm not
ten feet from you" stated Ozymandius rather archly.
<br><br>
Completely nonplussed, the Sergeant shouted back "Pass freely, and welcome
to Qeynos, Honoured One!" and he and his twin bookend resumed their
positions on either side of the gates to the oldest human city in Norrath.
<br><br>
Sighing tiredly, Ozymandius trudged into the city, seeking audience with the
town's ruler.  As he passed Crow's tavern, he could clearly hear a pint of
Kalish calling his name, but this was a visit of business, not pleasure.
Resigning himself to having to meet the brutally efficient Antonius Bayle
sober, he continued his trek, arriving at the Bayle estate and slowly
ascending the steps.  The two guards outside the main doors recognized him
and banged their halberd shafts against the marble floor in welcome, then
opened the door and admitted him.
<br><br>
Pausing to glance about himself, Ozymandius once again noted the simple,
almost military design of the house of the ruler of the human lands of
Western Norrath.  A place for everything and everything in it's place.
Mumbling something about cleanliness being the shelter of small minds, he
made his way across the foyer and rapped on the office doors with his staff.
<br><br>
"Come!" barked a voice from the other side of the door.  Ozymandius pushed
the door open and stepped into the office.  After all these years, the sight
of Antonius still surprised him.  The tallest human he's ever seen, short of
a barbarian, broader than most dwarves, and more comfortable in full plate
than regular clothing, Antonius sat straight and stiff, perusing paperwork
that was in neat piles about his desk.  Intense blue eyes under big bushy
black eyebrows, and a shock of black hair, cut very short, and graying at
the temples.
<br><br>
"Ozymandius!" exclaimed Bayle as he stood up, stepped around his huge desk,
and grasped the wizard's hand in a grip that could squeeze water from a
stone.  "How are you, old friend?  I've not seen you in months.  All is
well?"
<br><br>
The wizard pulled up a chair and had a seat as Bayle returned to his own
chair, shuffling papers around then giving his guest his undivided
attention.
<br><br>
"Things are not well, Antonius.  I found another caravan slaughtered on the
Karanas route."
<br><br>
Ozymandius could hear the grinding of metal on metal as Antonius clenched
his hands into fists, though his face showed no anger.  "How many?" he asked
quietly.
<br><br>
"I counted over twelve dead, including women and children.  And one High Elf
butchered and sacrificed."
<br><br>
"Sacrificed?  Who did this?" confusion showing clear on Bayle's stony face.
<br><br>
"Gnolls did the deed, but the sacrifice was something else.  There is only
one race that would un-make a High Elf, and only one thing it could mean.
Vashaar is coming."  Ozymandius said in a level voice, his face showing no
emotion.
<br><br>
"Vashaar?!  What does that bastard creation of the Prince of Hate want in
the Karanas?  And since when do the Gnolls work with Teir'dal?  This makes
no sense at all."  Antonius stood up and paced, his hands behind his back,
the sound of his metal boots scraping the marble floor with his stride.
<br><br>
"Vashaar's desires have not changed in a century, my friend.  He wants to
maintain his status as favoured child and spread hatred across all of
Norrath.  As for the Gnolls, it was as I feared when I came to you months
ago and asked you to tighten your patrols in Karanas.  Someone is uniting
the Gnolls to a common cause.  That common cause is your extinction, and
that someone is Vashaar."  Ozymandius leaned back in his chair, watching his
friend, knowing the reaction he would get but unable to prevent it.
<br><br>
Antonius wheeled and slammed his hands upon his desk, sending material
scattering "Dammit, Ozymandius!  I don't have the manpower!  I've the Druid
of Jaggedpine in here telling me to help her keep the Gnoll poachers from
her woods, the merchants of Qeynos demanding better protection from the
rogues and vermin that live in the sewers, rumours of an evil cult festering
within my very walls, and you saying the Karanas needs to be more heavily
patrolled.  It's just not possible!  Do you have any idea how many men it
would take to effectively patrol that barren place?"
<br><br>
"Whether it is possible or not, it must be done.  If the Gnolls of Split
Paw, Infected Paw, and Blackburrow unite, your problems are only beginning.
You have no choice.  Vashaar could care less about your resource problems or
your complaints.  He revels in hate.  His hate of you, your hate of him.
The greater the chaos and mayhem, the greater his rewards from his Master.
Even the priests of Rodcet here in Qeynos will be no defense if three tribes of
Gnolls descend upon you."  Ozymandius took a deep breath and sighed, his
eyes never leaving Antonius' watching for his reaction.
<br><br>
The larger man sat heavily into his chair and closed his eyes.  Silence hung
in the room for several moments.  Finally, in a grumbling tone, Antonius
Bayle said "It shall be done."
<br><br>
Ozymandius nodded and stood.  "Good.  Now I'll go get you some help."  The
slender wizard turned and headed for the door.
<br><br>
Antonius chafed for a second at the wizard leaving without being dismissed,
then laughed at himself at the audacity of that thought.  "Help?  From
where?"
<br><br>
"I have my sources, old friend.  Fear not.  I would not hand you an
impossible task without making sure you had the tools to accomplish it."
Ozymandius smiled reassuringly at Antonius Bayle, then turned and the room,
the door clicking shut behind him.
