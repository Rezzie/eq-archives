Kendrick squatted on the damp ground, the fog creeping around his ankles, and frowned at the setting sun.  "Why does this have to be at night?"
<br><br>
Jalen frowned, his bushy eyebrows meeting in confusion.  "Because they are undead?"

<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
	Barin was a dwarf warrior of the Devlar who fought in the wars against the dark elves.  He was generally an unremarkable individual, except for his desire to eventually found his own mine after he had finished fighting the dark elves.  He wished to start his mining in a new mountain range, away from the current delvings that existed.   Of course, such an endeavor requires clan members to believe in the talent or funding of a particular individual, and Barin, as far as he knew, didn't have either… yet.

A dwarven one called Bord TwoAxe<br>
Was stayed near Qeynos-town.<br>
When moanings did his ears fall on--<br>
A bardling casted down.<br>

"What fate met I in Commons East,<br>
while hunting with a friend.<br>
A bear, so great, and griffon too<br>
Didst send me to my end!"<br>

	Ozat didn't like the woman, really.  She was very pretty, yes, and any man would certainly desire her attentions, but he was old, and a woman's attentions were the furthest thing from his mind.  He saw through pale milky skin and raven black tresses, past the pretty face and deep into the person that stood before him. And what he saw was... nothing.  Euphoria, they called her.  No known real name, no relatives,  no friends; no acquaintances at all as far as Ozat knew.  Which was probably the main reason he didn't like the woman.  Information was his business, and when it came to Euphoria quite simply there was none.  Ozat didn't like being in the dark, and rarely was.  Yet here she stood; known by all who lived on the darker side of virtue, yet not truly known by any living being.

The sun shines in Greater Faydark about as often as trolls clean their ears.  Despite that my travel companion forgot to bring the torches.
<br><br>
"You didn't say we were going to need them."

I just shook my head and continued walking.  Lotis was a great one for light when there was makeup at her disposal, but if it came to doing anything in the world that required work she was conveniently forgetful.

What could be worse than interviewing an EQX staffer?  How about interviewing as many at one time as you can squeeze into a chat room!
<br><br>
Since we've come upon our first Anniversary we thought it would be interesting to toss out some questions to the EQX staff and see where they are coming from.

The sun had just set behind the peaks of Lavastorm, leaving behind the last traces of daylight in a blaze of purples and reds.  Perched on a small boulder just outside of the city's entrance, Veikara watched the final rays disappear, and the moon slowly creep up to light the night sky. The rise of the moon was perhaps the only thing she found to be beautiful in this world she so hated. She remained unmoved until the moon had reached it's height atop the towering peaks. Slowly she stood, stretching her back , then grabbed her boar-spear and the small backpack she had packed before leaving her home and was on her way<b>...</b>

Hello,  I'm a powergamer, and I'm annoyed.
<br><br>
 Not with you (the EQX staff) personally, but with members of  the
community you serve who badmouth those who share my playing style.
I'm directing my rant here because this site is as close to an "official
voice" of the EQ roleplaying community as I can find.

<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
Once, Bristlebane, the prankster of the gods, had an idea.  He thought it would be great fun to sneak into Erollisi Marr's home and steal her love.  He had seen her with it at all times, and it was so beautiful and shiny.  It filled her up and radiated from her.  Wouldn't it be a great prank to take her love,  to see the look on her face the next day as she walked through the halls of the gods? The goddess of love with no love at all!

Well, I no longer have a lot of excuses for not writing anything at all about EverQuest in my editorials.  Previously I was under the much misunderstood non-disclosure agreement, and even writing my opinions about EverQuest was difficult without violating that agreement.

Recently I have had an e-mail exchange with a reader about role-playing, where we discussed role-playing and what environments or games are appropriate.  In this discussion, the reader had a well thought out list of which MUD, MUSH or MOO environments are better or worse for role-playing.

I just read the recent EQX article, "<a href="../Issue51/woman.htm">A Woman's Point of View</a>", by
Saskia, and I have a few comments to make on it.  Firstly, I heartily
agree with most of her analysis about RPG games from a feminine
viewpoint.  I also play for the interaction and teamwork of the game.
(Even though I *do* enjoy at times, the action oriented games like Quake
- there's a certain time of every month when almost any woman just loves
to be able to blow things up!)

<em>OK, so roleplaying is a big issue right now.  I've got a pickle for ya.  When you start out in Everquest, you are understandably pretty wussy.  Say you're roleplaying an Erudite Wizard who has been studying the art of magic all your life.  When you create your character in Everquest, how do you explain the fact that, although you have all these years of experience, the best trick you can do right now is lighting your thumb on fire?

<b><u>Prolog</b></u>
<br><br>
	Sinuous coils slowly unwrapped themselves from their obsidian perch.  The ponderous body, lifted erect by the reptilian motion, began to move forward.  Broad shoulders atop a barrel-like chest branched out into muscular arms which ended in sharp, raking talons.  Above the shoulders, a blank nothingness.  No facial features, no expression, no gleam of intellect or humor adorned that massive brow. The air, thick and moist with the stink of fear and despair, roiled about the gigantic form as it moved with a silent whisper across the stark landscape, for here, on the Plane of Terror, lived Cazic-Thule.
