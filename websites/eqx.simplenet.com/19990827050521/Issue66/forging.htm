	<em>The Forge: The hand moves, tossing more fine coal onto the fire. The bellows work, breathing life & heat into the flame. The rod stirs, shaping the fire. The hand moves again, adding something odd to the furnace.</em>
<br><br>
	The goblin cocks it's head. The rattle of a pebble on stone draws it's attention, but it is not so distracted that it's prey gets away. With a quick twist, it finishes it's game and stuffs it into a bag. Moving along the ridge with utmost caution it comes to the landing and looks down into the canyon leading to the forest. Gnomes! A caravan of them! Five small ones and four of them are carrying heavy packs! With a wicked grin full of pointed teeth, the scout abandons his post and runs for camp.
	<br><br>
	<em>The Metal: The blocks of metal are stacked, the hard metal sandwiched between the soft. The hand dribbles something onto the blocks and traces a symbol. The bellows slow and the metal is put near the furnace to warm it through and through.</em>
<br><br>
	Mithradun Shavesteel strode through the Butcherblok with a workman-like air, yet the air was habit only.  He was so preoccupied with his anticipation of the marrow's First Forging that he completely failed to notice the two green-skins slipping from tree to tree behind him. On the marrow, they would be beginning the forging of an enchanted broadsword. This would be the first time he saw the working of enchanted metals and would mark his advancement from Journeyman to Craftsman. Thinking of the enchanted ingots the Gnomes were bringing, he absently patted his ten-pounder, Driver, hanging from his heavy smithing leathers.  The goblins slipped closer.
<br><br>
	Mithradun nodded curtly to the guards as he took the left fork at the Crossroads. In truth, he did not even notice them. He was nodding to himself as he went over and over the steps he'd need to take to prepare the forge. Nor did he notice the sudden shock of combat as the guards laid into his stalkers. He grinned with the thought that the Enchanters might bring that impudent sprite of a son with them. The lad was a nuisance around the smithy, but his squeals of mock fright and tinkling laughter made even the dourest dwarf smile.
<br><br>
	Thinking of the Gnomes he glanced ahead, a faint crease of unease between his brows. He should have met them by now. Perhaps there was a problem with the enchanting, or perhaps the Small Ones grew weary from the long trek and rested. 
	<br><br>
	<em>The Anvil: Heating the metal to glowing, almost white heat, the hand removes it and places it ringingly against an anvil.</em>
<br><br>
	Nearing the pass, Mithradun heard a faint cry, almost like a sea bird. Breaking into a run, he heard metal ringing on metal and the unmistakable sound of arcane energy being released. He pulled Driver from his belt and rounded the first corner in the pass. Before him lay a slaughter. Several bodies, gnomish and goblin, lay between him and a struggling knot of goblins. His eyes were drawn to the first body, a gnome. No. Not "a gnome". This was the Enchanter. The Enchanter was dead. Singing Void would cast no more of his bawdy illusions to delight the dwarves.  He could not accept it. And that one, a goblin. And another. There a gnome he did not know. And there, Brell save him, Vibrant Void. She was just sitting with her head bowed. Only the spreading stain on her robes claimed anything else. Shock stopped his mind, stopped his rush.
<br><br>
	<em>The Hammer: The hand picks up a hammer too heavy to lift. The hammer pounds the metal, driving the soft into the hard, driving the impurities out, welding the metal into something much greater.</em>
<br><br>
	The rush of blood in his ears, the sound of shock, fades. It doesn't fade much, just enough to let the ringing of steel on steel penetrate to Mithradun's heart. His eyes drag themselves off the still, sitting form that looked so much like his friend toward the sound. Someone still lives, lives and fights!
<br><br>
	With a rush of emotion so intense, so full of grief, anger, fear and righteous wrath that it could scarcely belong to a mere mortal, Mithradun charged the struggling group. With a bellowing "Brell!" he threw Driver with his entire smith-forged dwarven strength into the face of the one goblin that turned to face him. Such was his strength that the goblin somersaulted backwards, faceless. On the far side, a goblin staggered away keening an insane wail. Awkwardly holding the stump of it's right arm, it collapsed and fell silent.
<br><br>
	Reaching the last two goblins he finally saw their opponent. A blood splattered gnomish warrior held both at bay, armed with a fine rapier in each flashing hand. Mithradun never even slowed, bowling into the near goblin. The world spun in a confusing whirl of teeth and fists that barroom brawls left him ill prepared for. When they stopped rolling the goblin bestrode the dwarf and began pounding him with great blows. The smith, one eye already swelling shut, ignored the beating and reached up with his great rock hard hands and squeezed. The pounding became frantic and moved to Mithradun's arms. Just as this goblin had earlier, Mithradun twisted his hands. There was a sharp crack and both, goblin and dwarf, relaxed.
<br><br>
	Again it was the bell-like ringing of steel on steel, so like a hammer on an anvil, that drove Mithradun out of shock. Rolling over and getting to his feet, he saw the last goblin sweep in with a great overhand cut that the gnome was just too weary to evade. Steel cut flesh. The gnome cried out and spun away, awkwardly blocking the follow-up stroke with his only arm. Mithradun, possessed by a fury not entirely his, blind-sided the goblin, knocking it back. He swung his fist into the goblin's face.  With a satisfying crunch, the goblin folded.
<br><br>
	Turning quickly to the wounded gnome, Mithradun thought wildly of all the warrior's tales he had heard, desperately trying to think of what to do. The gnome sat down hard and looked at where his left arm ended. Mithradun whispered "Oh, Great Brell, help me." And reached out a hand to the warrior. Wanting to help so much, but not knowing how to help. And a voice whispered back "No, Mithradun. <em>You</em> shall help <em>me</em>." Mithradun's hands began to glow and a feeling that was both rapture and torture, stimulating and enervating came over him. The bleeding, so terrible and quick, suddenly stopped. The end, ragged torn raw meat, suddenly smoothed out and skinned over. Light and intelligence returned to the warrior's face.
<br><br>
The warrior looked up at his benefactor, grinned gnomishly and said "Well met, Fist of God! Excuse me..." and thrust his rapier at Mithradun. Jerking back in startlement, Mithradun knocked into something and twisted aside. The rapier passed by him, within an inch, and sunk with a meaty thunk into the last goblin. Standing with sword high, the goblin looked as surprised as the smith. It sank down to one knee, then both. It dropped it's sword, then dropped it's arms to the ground and slowly bent over, almost as if bowing to it's tiny foe.
<br><br>
The warrior withdrew his rapier and used it as a cane to help stand up. Wiping it carefully, he sheathed it and turned to Mithradun. He held out his hand and said, "I am named Brander Snickersnee. I shall call thee friend." 
<br><br>
Mithradun took his hand and said, "Friend indeed. I am… I am Cestus. Cestus Dei. Here I have found a new life. It is only meet that ye have given me a new name as well.
