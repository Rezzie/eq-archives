<em>"Why do you do this to me?  What is it inside you that forces you to leave the ones you love?  To hurt them this much?"
<br><br>
	"I… I don't know."
<br><br>
	"Every night I pray that you are even still alive, and every morning I wake up and think you might not be there next to me.  All I want is the assurance that you'll be there for me and for your child.  But even this is too much to ask.  What is it that haunts you, Edril?  You're chasing a demon that isn't even there, running from things no one else can understand.  But I'm trying to understand, for you and for our son.  Why do you leave us without so much as a word to say goodbye?  You trust no one but the sword in your hand, love nothing but the adventure and the blood of your enemies…"
<br><br>
	"No, I love you Almaril."
<br><br>
	"So why do you run from me?  Why?"
<br><br>
	"Because… I'm worried…everything close to me dies.  If I get too close… then…"
<br><br>
	"… Such sad eyes.  Why is it that death haunts someone so noble?  And what happens when this curse catches up to your wife and child, Edril?  What then?"</em>
<br><br>
	The barbarian, the large sword on his back rattling against his tattered suit of chain mail, spurred his horse closer to the party's head with a quick lash of the reins.  The ogres and trolls around him, moving on foot with surprising speed, all glared as the northman's mount passed by.  Closing their eyes as the swirling dust from the desert floor hit them, kicked up by the horse's powerful strides, each ran a hand over their long faces to shake dirt and sweat from rough skin.  Behind them their foot trails faded over the horizon, etched in sand from miles of walking and four whole days of fruitless wandering.  "Thinking about something, elf?"  Aryn asked in his customary deep throated tone as he came to a stop near the front of the group.  Behind him the eyes of several troll warriors studied his back and searched for the best place to thrust a dagger.  Aryn knew it and grinned.
<br><br>
	Edril, his eyes empty and his mind lost in the remembrance of past events, was startled by the sound of the barbarian's voice.  He turned his head quickly, face wrapped by a black cloth to block the sand and his hood pulled over his eyes, and surveyed the land to get a quick bearing of where he was.  "Uhhh…" he began in confusion, as if awakening from a dream.  "No…nothing."
<br><br>
	Aryn scratched his chin and turned his eyes to the distant hills of Ro before them.  "Get your mind on the trail."  As he drew closer to the elf he lowered his voice.  "I don't see anything for miles.  Not tracks, not anything.  Maybe this prophet isn't really out here.  Maybe there's no prophet at all."
<br><br>
	Edril shook his head, recognizing the suspicion in the barbarian's speech, and quieted his own voice.  "If they wanted us dead, Aryn, then we would be dead already."
<br><br>
	"How do we know?  What if these soldiers are our assassins?"  Aryn cast a suspicious glance behind him.  The ogres and trolls, dragging their heavy weapons in the sand behind them, returned the look with ugly snarls of protruding fangs.  "They probably realized normal temple guards couldn't bring us down and…"
<br><br>
	"Edril is right," the words drifted on desert winds, more a soft and inflected hiss then an actual voice.  "If we wanted you dead, you would have been killed long before now.  You place too much faith in your own skill, Barbarian.  But the temple needs you to stay alive as long as possible.  And so we must abide by it's wishes."  Jalic, troll priest of Cazic-Thule, rode on an oversized horse directly at the head of the travelers.  He sat hunched over his saddle, being thinner then most trolls, and his red robes hung low over the sides of his mount.  
<br><br>
	Edril smiled.  "Damn that hearing of yours, Jalic!" Aryn yelled up to the troll.
<br><br>
	Jalic only looked to the horizon, brushing a hand across far away desert valleys.  "If we keep going north we'll arrive there in two days."
<br><br>
	"How do you know that?"  asked the barbarian, eyes narrowed and strained from days under a restless sun.
<br><br>
	"The temple has always known the location of Zisstrik the insane, and I am well versed in all matters dealing with desert of Ro geography."  Jalic shook his head, his hood falling behind his pointed ears.  "But as the master told you, the temple has been unable to deal with the situation until now."
<br><br>
	"And why is that?" Aryn asked.
<br><br>
	"Because," Edril answered for the troll, "the best way to avoid a civil war is to keep the kingdom ignorant."
<br><br>
	Jalic nodded.  "It is the best way to save our people from destruction."
<br><br>
	"It is the best way to keep the temple in control,"  the elf said and Jalic nodded again.
<br><br>
	"This is also true," the troll remarked casually as if it were already common knowledge.
<br><br>
	The barbarian, running one hand through the clotted mane of his horse, breathed a heavy sigh and looked to the cloudless sky overhead.  "I'm sure glad the main reason I'm out here is for the money," he admitted, "because I don't know if we're fighting with the good guys or the bad."  Jalic actually chuckled.
<br><br>
	From somewhere behind them, garbled by the harsh inflections native to the creatures of the serpent's spine, came a deep and growling voice.  The ogre was clothed much like the companion at his side, covered from head to foot in loose and jagged armor, mostly the torn and dented scraps picked from the corpses of his victims.  On his shoulder he hefted a great axe, the blade scarred and stained a light red.  He spoke a few garbled words in a bitter sounding voice, then pointed to the barbarian.
<br><br>
	Aryn turned his head, gave a nasty look, and pointed back.  "Wish I could understand," he said to the nearby Edril, "but they talk too fast."
<br><br>
	Jalic spoke without even looking back.  "He says he hates the sound of your voice, and that both ogres will cut your throat out if you do not remain silent."
<br><br>
	"Is that so?" the barbarian brought his horse to a sudden halt and spun the mount around, placing one hand on the hilt of his sword.  "Tell them they're both welcome to try!"  Aryn thundered and grinned.
<br><br>
	The two ogres both stopped, first looking at the barbarian and then looking at each other.  Then both the massive warriors erupted into a chorus of horrible laughter, exchanging powerful slaps on the back.  One of them, pausing between laughs to catch his breath, said a few more garbled words to Aryn before attempting to quiet his friend.
<br><br>
	Jalic brought his own horse to a stop and turned, his small black fangs curled into a grin.  "That one's name is Gromlyko.  He says they like you, barbarian.  You've got spirit and you make them laugh.  They'll leave you alone."
<br><br>
	"Wonderful," began Aryn in a sarcastic tone, still cautiously keeping a watchful eye on both ogres, "I've made some friends in Oggok.  This is going to be a great trip."  The barbarian held a hand to his face, blocking the intense rays cast down by the sun of Norrath, while his red hair shivered in hot desert winds.
<br><br>
	The travelers urged their horses onward and the party continued once more.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
The words echoed around him, shattering his silent contemplation with the booming voice he had grown to love and cherish.  "<em>Uramph uzk gurzok</em>."  Zisstrik opened his eyes and found himself perched on the edge of a crumbling road held up by nothing in an endless expanse of twisting colors.  The air around him seemed to churn it's way through his body, taking away all sounds along the dreamscape horizon with it.  Only the great serpent's voice remained to be heard.  "<em>Uramph uzk gurzok, Zisstrik</em>," the voice echoed once more.
<br><br>
	Zisstrik struggled to his knees and held his arms outstretched above him.  A smile was displayed across the troll's other wise horrific face.  "My master, at last you have come to me once more!"  His words almost matched those of the dragon's in intensity.
<br><br>
	A pair of deep and serpentine eyes appeared on the twisting backdrop of the troll's dream.  "Death is coming," the serpent said.
<br><br>
	"Yes, master, I will bring death to all the temple heretics.  The kingdom will be ours once more."
<br><br>
	Laughter, a horrible cackle of high pitched tones, erupted from everywhere at once.  The colors around the troll shook violently and Zisstrik fell to the ground with his hands over his head.  The sounds were too hideous even for the great prophet.  "Fool!"  the word made Zisstrik twitch, "Death is coming for YOU!"  The scarred and reptilian visage of Trakanon, once great dragon god of the trolls, joined the pair of suspended eyes.  His lips and fangs were curled down in a snarl of disdain.
<br><br>
	Zisstrik picked himself up and looked meekly at his master.  "What…what do you mean?"
<br><br>
	"Before the day is through," the dragon narrowed his eyes and breathed heavily, "you will be dead."
<br><br>
	Zisstrik's eyes widened.  "What?  How?… Who?!"
<br><br>
	"The temple has sent warriors to kill you.  And kill you they will."
<br><br>
	The troll jumped to his feet and raised a fist into the air.  Light crackled from the edges of his hand.  "But I will stop them!"
<br><br>
	"No, Zisstrik."  The dragon shook his head.  "You will not."
<br><br>
	"But I am powerful enough to defeat even the greatest foes!  I have fifty trolls ready to die for me,"  the light extended around Zisstrik's body, "and with your help, master, the fools will…"
<br><br>
	"There will be no help."
<br><br>
	The light around the troll faded and Zisstrik lowered his arms.  "What?" he asked in disbelief.
<br><br>
	"I cannot help you.  Death approaches and so I must go."
<br><br>
	Zisstrik's jaw dropped in utter disbelief.  "But, master," he managed, "You can't leave me.  Not after all I have done for you."  The dragon turned his eyes away and did not answer.  Zisstrik fumbled in his speech.  "B…but you are the god of the trolls…with your power I could…"
<br><br>
	"What am I?!" the dragon's forked tongue flickered from over the edge of it's fangs and the face drifted closer to Zisstrik.  "What am I, you sniveling fool?!"
<br><br>
	The troll began to tremble.  "You…you are the king of the trolls."
<br><br>
	"No, Zisstrik.  I am something different, but you are too stupid to realize it."  The face of the serpent faded.  In it's place formed an exact copy of the prophet: Zisstrik's body clothed in Zisstrik's robes. Only his face was mutated into the scaly and long form of the dragon's own visage.  "You made me!  You made me because you were afraid and weak.  You made me because you couldn't live without me."
<br><br>
	Zisstrik faltered back on his feet, and fell to his knees again in confusion.  His legs shook violently with bewilderment.  "But…you gave me power."
<br><br>
	"The scrolls you stole.  The pictures on the temple walls.  Your own forgotten wishes.  You pieced me together from all of these things and gave yourself the power."  The disfigured form before him actually grinned.  "And now the pale skinned ghost of your own fears hunts for your blood in his black cloak.  Now his sword searches for your throat.  Now you are going to pay for your stupidity.  Now you are going to die."
<br><br>
	The dragon's form faded slowly into nothing, and the colors around Zisstrik solidified into dull shades of stone.  The troll, whimpering with his head in his hands, twitched and shivered with fear and disbelief.  Somewhere deep inside he fought to keep the truth from spreading, he fought against that which he already knew.  "No…" he said quietly.  From his body poured a red light which covered the dreamscape road like a spreading fire.  "NO!"  Zisstrik threw his arms into the air, his eyes closed and his mouth open and screaming.  Small flickers of lightning danced up his skin.  "Don't leave me master!"  The lightning spread around him and the floor beneath his legs began to crumble and drift away.  The tears down his cheeks were burned away in sparks of red and white.  "DON'T ABANDON ME!!"  Bolts arced from his body and arms to the floor around him and the stone exploded into a thousand pieces, showering around the troll in a curtain of crystal shards.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
	Edril crawled along scalding sands under the shadow of a nearby hill.  He moved without making a sound, sifting his way like a snake and carving a long trail in the desert behind him, before reaching the safety of the high rising dune.  Once securely hidden in it's shade, he turned on his back and shook layers of dust from the front of his dark robes and from between the strands of his silver hair.  With one hand on the long handle of his curved blade, his narrow elven eyes searched left and right for any sign of detection.  When he was confident no guards were approaching, he lowered his hood and looked back.
<br><br>
	Behind him Aryn, Jalic, the trolls, and the ogres lay low behind other dunes and waited for a signal.  Edril's first impulse was to call out to the party, but he caught himself just in time to remain quiet.  It was imperative he stay as silent as possible, for over the hill patrolled dozens of troll guards looking for any sign of an intruder and ready to kill on sight.  Instead the elf slowly raised one arm and motioned for the rest to approach.
<br><br>
	The party moved with a swiftness and grace Edril found very unnatural.  Even the ogres, pulling themselves over the sand with powerful arms, seemed to be more quiet then the elf had expected.  Then Edril remembered that while the soldiers were both young and extremely large, each was a seasoned warrior and hand picked by the high priest of Grobb.  "Are we clear?"  the barbarian asked as he drew closer.  Aryn and Jalic were the first to reach the shadowed hiding place with the soldier Snargob and his band of four trolls close behind.  The two ogres, Gromlyko and Kugrokh, purposefully stayed in the rear.
<br><br>
	Edril nodded and spoke in whispers.  "Yes, there are no guards around here.  But I haven't gotten a good look of the camp yet."
<br><br>
	Aryn looked around, the sand in his red beard showering to the floor.  "I'll have a peek, tell you what we can expect."  Taking hold of the edges of the sand dune, the barbarian, with a northern grace learned long ago from hunting the tundra animals of the Halas region, slowly crawled from under the protective shadow of the dune and over the top, so as to get a better view of the camp before them.  He gazed into the valley below, counting the heads of troll guards and hiding his eyes from the shine of the sun off their glittering steel weaponry.
<br><br>
	When the barbarian did not speak for some time Edril called up to him.  "Aryn," he quietly said, "What do you see?"
<br><br>
	Aryn slid slowly down the dune, sitting next to the elf, and began to speak with a worried expression.  "I count fifty maybe sixty heads.  Little armor but all with weaponry."  Edril lowered his eyes to the floor and the barbarian sighed.  "We can't beat those odds, elf."
<br><br>
	Edril nodded his agreement and turned his head to Jalic.  "Sixty guards to the ten of us.  All armed and all willing to die.  What's the call Jalic?"
<br><br>
	The small troll priest, his hands folded before him, stared behind the party across the desert horizon.  "We cannot beat all his guards, this is true," Jalic ran one finger across his green skinned face, "but the journey is still successful if we kill Zisstrik."
<br><br>
	"So what do we do?"  
<br><br>
	"All we need to accomplish is getting to Zisstrik.  We clear the guards to get to him, then run when the traitor is dead.  Then our mission is complete."
<br><br>
	"How do we get to him?"
<br><br>
	Jalic turned his red eyes to Aryn.  "Barbarian, you should have been able to see it from the top of the hill.  Was there anything worth noting in the camp?"
<br><br>
	Aryn stroked his beard.  "Well… the entire camp is in a valley.  From here it would be easy to charge down and make a surprise strike, but then we have to worry about the guards."
<br><br>
	"Any unusual structures?"
<br><br>
	The barbarian nodded.  "The camp is just groups of tents and old fires.  Most are standard but right in the middle is a square shaped structure: dark, with flags all around it."
<br><br>
	Jalic lowered his eyes.  "Then that is where Zisstrik lies."
<br><br>
	Aryn bit his upper lip and looked away.  "Then we have bigger problems," he continued, "and I mean big.  I think that's a sand giant sitting right in front of his tent.  Just sitting there looking at the rest of the camp."  He chuckled bitterly.  "Trolls and giants, I've never heard of such a thing."
<br><br>
	Jalic suddenly jerked his head up, his eyes wide and his scaly face contorted in a way Edril had never seen before.  "A sand giant?  Are you sure?"  The barbarian nodded again.  "He has more power then we thought.  I was not expecting this."
<br><br>
	Both the elf and Aryn looked at each other.  The barbarian raised an eyebrow.  "Edril, it's not too late to back out.  If we can't make it then there's no reason…"
<br><br>
	The ogre Kugrokh, a young warrior with red scars all over his chest and face, called up to the shadow of the dune in a low and cracked voice.  "<em>Dol treh bogoli uzk grokel</em>."
<br><br>
	"<em>Nek!</em>"  Jalic barked, a sound which even made Edril jump.  "<em>Hur uzk neg nedal ulornin</em>."
<br><br>
	The ogre growled and looked away shamefully.  After a brief pause, the barbarian spoke.  "What did you say?"
<br><br>
	Jalic turned his nose into the air.  "He said you were a coward, afraid to enter battle.  I told him you were just not stupid."  Aryn looked away and turned his eyes down, unable to thank a troll.  "But barbarian, we cannot turn back now.  We have come too far and too much is at stake here."
<br><br>
	"Jalic is right," Edril agreed.
<br><br>
	The barbarian turned his head back to the two and, after a brief hesitation, shrugged.  "It's a good day to die anyway.  So what's the plan?  Between us and the giant stands about 15 guards, more to follow once the surprise wears off."
<br><br>
	Jalic folded his hands once more in front of him and thought for a moment silently.  "Here's what we do," he finally answered.  "We clear a path for a group to approach the giant and Zisstrik, one group pushes to the right and the other to the left.  Everything has to be done quickly, and Zisstrik has to be killed in time enough for all of us to escape.  But how do we organize this so that we have enough force…"  Turning slightly to the soldiers behind him, Jalic began to rapidly explain the situation in their foreign tongue.  The eyes of the ogres and trolls actually grew, filled with the fire of battle lust, and many of them smiled widely.
<br><br>
	Aryn shook his head.  "I don't know what's worse," he remarked, "taking on the whole of the camp by ourselves or staying here with these crazy bastards."
<br><br>
	Gromlyko the ogre, pulling himself forward with a powerful arm, slapped Aryn on the front of the leg.  "Me an' yoo, hooman," he managed, "we take giant.  We bash 'im goot."  The warrior smiled, two long fangs on either side of his mouth popping out from under his upper lip.
<br><br>
	The barbarian ran a hand over his head and hair, then shrugged once more.  "Sure, Grom."  Then he turned to Edril.  "If I die, elf, make sure that son of dirty gnomish whore dies with me."
<br><br>
	"Then it is settled,"  Jalic spoke.  "One troll and Kugrokh will push left, Snargob and the other three will push right and charge first.  Gromlyko and Aryn will fight to the giant and slay the beast.  I will assisst wherever a shaman's touch is necessary.  And Edril, you are to wait back here until a path is cleared and then you are to kill Zisstrik the insane."
<br><br>
	Edril's ears twitched.  "What?  But… why?"
<br><br>
	"You are the fastest and you are deadly.  We need it done right and we need it done quickly.  You are the only one."
<br><br>
	Edril began to protest.  He wanted to fight at the sides of the party, wanted to taste battle once more, but eventually saw the truth to the troll shaman's words.  The others were too large, too savage, and too sloppy to take care of Zisstrik.  The elf finally nodded his agreement.
<br><br>
	Jalic looked around.  "Alright then, prepare yourselves.  On the count of three."  The shaman looked all around at the warriors gathered and held his hand up to signal.  "One."  Aryn unstrapped the large northern sword from his back and clenched his teeth.  Grabbing hold of the side of the dune, he dug his heels into the sand and prepared for the surprise advance.  "Two."  The ogres both rose to their knees and gripped their axes tightly with both powerful hands.  The troll commander and his soldiers pulled their swords slowly from their sheaths.  Each blade hissed across the leather in unison with the others.  Edril picked himself up and place a timid hand on the hilt of his own blade.  "THREE!"
<br><br>
	Jalic dropped his arm and the troll commander Snargob with three of his warriors, all screaming madly to the sky, lunged over the dune.  Their blades flickered in the sunlight.  More sliding then running the four warriors poured down the steep slopes of the desert valley in a cloud of billowing dust.  When their feet struck the firm ground of the valley's floor they charge unfaltered as the spreading sand cloud seeped into the camp.  One nearby guard pointed at the charging host and yelled before one of the warriors buried his sword between the guard's neck and shoulder, silencing the yell into a series of bloody gurgles.  Two more guards stumbled for their weapons but Snargob and his soldier cut them down before they could reach their tents.  Three additional guards were silenced before the rest were able to collect their weapons and fight back.  But still Snargob and his three warriors fought the guards back, pushing the troll traitors right in a bloody rampage.  The four warriors fought viciously, their own harsh ferocity tempered by years of sword discipline.
<br><br>
	More guards began to swarm around Snargob's host, attempting to attack them from behind, as the ogre Kugrokh and the last troll warrior drifted down the valley wall.  The two warriors crashed into the remaining guards with terrible cries of battle, slamming into the guards' blindsides and tearing them apart.  Kugrokh swung his greataxe madly and Zisstrik's men, both surprised and overwhelmed, were tossed to either side.  Their weapons snapped in half when put against the ogre's own heavy blade.  With the troll guards surprised and with the ogre's savage bludgeoning as well as the troll warrior's deft swordsmanship, both warriors bitterly pushed the line of guards to the left.  Kugrokh the ogre howled with every kill.
<br><br>
	But as seen from high above the valley, more guards from every side of the camp were preparing to advance on the attackers.  "Come on!  We don't have much time!" Aryn yelled as he jumped over the dune and slid down the cliffside.  Gromlyko followed close behind, his axe waving in the air above him.  Both the ogre and barbarian charged up the path their comrades had carved for them.  The crude tents on either side of the them blurred past as they ran towards the black hut in the middle of the valley.  There sat the massive sand giant, just now aware of the scene unfolding before him, preparing to stand and charge.  Two hidden guards suddenly came into the path before Aryn and the ogre and lunged with weapons outstretched.  The barbarian stepped to the side for one of them, bringing his long sword slamming into the guard's chest and killing the troll almost instantly.  Gromlyko caught the other lunging guard in midair by the throat, held him out, sliced the troll across the stomach with the edge of his axe, and tossed the body away.  After a short additional run over the haphazard camp terrain Aryn and Gromlyko finally were in the shadow of the massive giant.
<br><br>
	The beast stood with a vicious grin and a low, rumbling chuckle.  He stood hunched over the two warriors and stretched his massive muscles and wicked claws.  Gazing down at the two with blood red eyes he thundered the words "must protect master!" across the valley and brought both arms into the air.  First he punched down at the barbarian.  Aryn, first holding his sword up in defense then deciding against it, barely dove out of the way before the monster's fist struck the ground, sending large clumps of sand showering everywhere.  Where Aryn was standing remained a deep crater.  The beast tried another punch aimed at Gromlyko.  The ogre also dived out of the way just as the giant struck, but then jumped for the giant's arm while the dust was still settling.  His axe in one hand and the giant's arm in the other, Gromlyko bit down into the creature's flesh with all his fangs.  The giant howled and flailed his arm madly, but Gromlyko could not be shaken off.  The beast's blood trickled down the ogre's body.  The barbarian, picking up his dropped sword and shaking the dirt from it's surface, took the opportunity for his own offensive.  Aryn dove into the fray and jumped for the giant's chest, taking hold of some loose skin and driving the point of his sword through the center of the beast's midsection.  When the giant's screams seemed almost unbearable even to the ears of the mighty barbarian, he removed his sword for another strike.
<br><br>
	"By the gods, just die!!" Aryn cried as he twisted his blade into the same wound.  The creature only howled louder, twisting and writhing in pain.  Gromlyko, his jagged teeth still buried deep within the gaint's arm, brought his axe back and launched the weapon straight for the monster.  The axe edge hit the sand giant directly in the middle of it's neck, cutting it's way far inside, and the creature's screams were silenced as a red river of the giant's own blood began to seep from the base of the monster's head and down it's chest.  With one quick motion born of pain and desperation, the sand giant forced Aryn off it's body with a powerful swipe of his hand and pulled the long sword out, tossing it away.  The barbarian hit the ground with tremendous speed and slid across the desert floor, his body covered in stinging sands.  Gromlyko too was forced down with a sudden blow, tearing some skin away with him and rolling off into the dust.  The sand giant finally fell to his knees, holding his stomach and neck with both hands, and looked out at the warriors with narrowed eyes.  A hot breath hissed from behind rows of sharp fangs, and the creature snarled when he saw both warriors lying before him, helpless and without their weapons.  The giant slowly moved forward and prepared for one final strike.
<br><br>
	Jalic the shaman, his flowing robes of red trailing in the winds behind him, made his way slowly down the battlefield path as guards from all sides screamed in torment.  All around him Zisstrik's men writhed on the floor, grabbing their faces and bodies in pain, while black smoke rose from the corpses of others who had dared to challenge the student of the high priest.  He carved his own path through a wall of guards.  Fire danced from the small troll's hands like it does from the sun, and flames erupted all around the experienced shaman, burning the skin of any foolish troll who dared to approach him an obsidian black.  With unnatural speed the shaman found his way to the fallen Gromlyko and Aryn, and grinned up at the giant.  The beast, sensing power in the tiny aggressor, began to make a slow retreat.  Jalic shook his head and raised his arms high above him.  A shaft of bright light erupted from the shaman's body and found it's way into the wound Aryn had dug in the creature and then out the creature's back.  The giant began to tremble.  The beast also raised both arms as the light, screeching through the dry desert air, spread throughout the monster's body, flickering out the wounds both down it's arms and in it's neck.  After a while the light died down and only the soft sound of sizzling skin remained.  Black smoke poured from the giant's dead eyes, and the beast's empty corpse slumped over into the sand.  The valley shook when the dead monster fell.  Aryn and Gromlyko, who both slowly picked themselves up, shook their heads clear and thanked the gods they were still alive.
<br><br>
	And over it all, watching and waiting from the very top of the valley's cliffsides, stood the elven warrior Edril.  As soon as he saw the giant fall he slid his single edged curved blade from it's sheath and carefully made his way across the cliffside sands.  His feet pounded the ground when he began his run down the path, and his silver hair trailed behind him with the waving flaps of his black cloak.  All around him guards fell, and each screamed their failure to the prophet who sat and watched somewhere inside his dark tent.  One guard tried to strike Edril from the side with his axe, but the elf spun in time with his own blade to slice the wooden handle of the weapon, his swordedge cutting the axe in two.  Then Edril buried his blade in the guard's skull.  The troll shivered slightly then slumped to the sands below.  Edril watched him without a change of expression while inside something in the elf was heated and alive.

	He slid his blade from the troll's corpse gracefully and watched as the guard's blood trickled down the edge and to the sands below.  Something about the scene seemed right to Edril, something about the troll's blood and the troll's death brought peace to the elf's heart.  He felt calm and alive once more, and turned his head in grim determination.  Just ahead lay the dark tent of the lord of this camp.  Edril continued again, his sword clenched tightly in one hand, his cloak drifting in the dust behind him.  Edril moved quickly, his only thought on meeting the one they called Zisstrik the prophet.
<br><br>
	Death traveled with him.
