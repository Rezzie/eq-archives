Hello, My Name is Oghma, and I'm a characteraholic.<br>
<em>Crowd</em>: Hi Oghma!
<br><br>
It's been 3 days since I created my last character.  
<br><br>
It was just a dark elf wizardress, a member of the F'leurs DuMal guild, because I sometimes like blowing things up and occasionally playing evil.  The one before that was a little gnome enchantress, I had an idea for a character concept, and I wanted to see if charisma had that much of an effect on the resistance of enchantment, so I ran around Steamfont, enchanting kobolds. Thank god for the 8 characters per server rule, because with more servers coming up, it means more characters to try.  
<br><br>
I get ideas for character concept from everywhere, and I love trying them out.  Race/class combinations that I never even considered become viable after an X-files episode, or after talking to a friend about the merits of magical vs clerical spell power.  The lure of the new, the chance to put myself in another (fictional) mind for just a little while, overrides that powergamers desire I have for more levels, spells, and items.
<br><br>
If I added up the experience of all my characters, I'd have a 35th level character, easily. If I could only make a party with my 6 favorite characters, I'd be set.
<br><br>
There are times when I think I just must be a dilettante, a dabbler.  Someone with no stick-to-itiveness, no drive to succeed or excel.  In my real life, however, I'm quite accomplished and focussed on career and life goals, so that can't be it.  My files at home are overflowing with old D&D, AD&D, GURPS, Rolemaster, Space Opera, MERP,  and (insert RPG game here) characters and character concepts.  I have 20 years of characters kicking around my house, and sometimes I take them out and remember what I accomplished with them.
<br><br>
Agoroth, my first human fighter, who didn't excel in anything, stat-wise, but survived and survived. (1979-1983)
<br><br>
Arthedain, my first paladin, a noble warrior, betrayed by a dwarf who magicked an evil weapon and gave it to my paladin as if it were a holy sword. (1981-1983)
<br><br>
Panurge, the self sacrificing cleric, who once healed an entire party while a dragon was attacking him.  They had all fallen, and he walked from body to body, healing the other characters, while the dragon ripped and ripped at him.
<br><br>
Amlaith, the taciturn elf warrior, lithe and quick, never allowing himself to be put in another's debt. (1982-1988)
<br><br>
Chrysis, the elven bard in GURPS, who had a perfect memory and was a talented musician, to the exclusion of more mundane fighting skills. (1988-1992)
<br><br>
Miryam, the half elf magic user cleric, worshipper of Mystra, who's combined spell book took weeks to re-memorize. (1983-1988)
<br><br>
Oghma, the dwarven bard. (1996-present)
<br><br>
I find that there are often character archetypes that mean a lot to me.  The wise scholar is one of my favorites, in addition to the noble warrior and the straight talker.  Trickster characters like bards always fascinate me.  These archetypes sometimes have me creating all the possible variations on a theme, to see which class/race/gender combination fits it the best.  I like making female characters for the more subtle magic classes, like enchanters, but I often feel that magic has a very feminine aspect to it, so my male magic users are pretty rare.
<br><br>
I always love dwarves.  I have no idea why this is, it's really a semi-recent phenomenon, but put me in a world with dwarves and I'm as happy as, well, as a dwarf in a tavern.  In high school, it was elves who fascinated me, but I think that the effort of being aloof for someone as outgoing as myself was too much.  My best elves were the silent ones, since once I got started talking, I couldn't stop.  Much like my chatty Oghma persona, for those of you who put up with me. <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
<br><br>
I think, that when it comes down to it, there are too many stories to be told, to many players in the parts I have in my mind, to really ever stop creating new ones.  I was talking to Kakur today, and we likened it to having a bunch of books on a bookshelf.  Should I take down the Oghma book, and continue reading the Oghma story, or should I reach for the Ftili book, and go with her into the Butcherblock Mountains.  Perhaps today the gloom and oppression of Neriak would enjoin me to take down the book of Valanye.  Hmm.. this is a new title.. I wonder what this book is about?
