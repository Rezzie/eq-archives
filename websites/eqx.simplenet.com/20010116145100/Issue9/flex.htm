	<big><big>H</big></big>ow mighty is the warrior, how terrifying the necromancer?  How entertaining is the bard, how saintly the priest?
<br><br>
Only the player can decide that.
<br><br>
For the many years that I have been role playing I have watched the good and the bad.  Not just the good and bad characters, but the good and bad players as well.  And I have come up with some concepts that allow me to choose between the two.  Obviously not everyone will accept all of these, or any of them for that matter, as good guidelines for role playing well.  But I would like to think so.  And it all focuses on the idea of flexibility.
<br><br>
But when I created that character, I was not being a particularly good role player.  I really should have started fresh and done something new.  But even good role players aren’t perfect.

A good role player can choose any role and do it well.  He could be a paladin in the service of light or a jester in service to a king.  But it is not just that flexibility in choosing a profession that is important, it is deeper.  It is the ability to play that paladin with humor, and allow the jester to be serious about his work.  It is the ability to recognize that characters, like the people that play them, need to be varied and changing.
<br><br>
The ability to allow a character to change with his experience is another key to playing the character well.  For example I will use one of my own.  One of my favorite characters was a bounty hunter named Relnargh.  He, throughout the time I played him, learned to despise wizards.  They were constantly blasting him on "accident".  Up until the day he died his final death, he hated mages.  When this character died, I decided to make a new one.  I created his son, Radvar.  I intended to make him exactly like his father.  But it didn’t happen that way.  A mage became his most trusted companion.  He learned to work well <em>with</em> wizards.  Not that he also was not very good at killing them.  Working with them made knowing how to kill them easy too.  But he did not hunt them like his father.  In fact, Radvar is a darn site nicer than his father ever was.  All because he evolved as I played him.

Most of us create characters with a plan for their future.  Someone might create a high elf that hates or at least disdains all of the <em>lesser</em> races.  The player may intend that the character will learn to like the other races as he gets to know them.  That may be a fine concept.  But what if the first human he meets spits on him.  What if the next one he meets steals from him.  I might imagine that this elf would now be somewhat unlikely to enter a whole city full of humans.  Even if the player really wants to go there because he knows that one of his friends is playing a human that lives there.  While the player might still decide to go in, he must be aware of all considerations, and be flexible enough to simply leave if these humans prove to be no better than the rest.  Even the character that his friend is playing might not be someone that his character would trust.
<br><br>
I want to encourage all the potential players of EverQuest to consider being flexible when making their characters, and when playing them.  Let the story tell itself, and wrap your character up in it.
