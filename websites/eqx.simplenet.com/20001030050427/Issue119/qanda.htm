  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Nep, I have seen a lot of news and information posted about 
  the various server splits, but no real information as to if these splits have 
  been successful in the eyes of Verant or the players that have moved. Wonder 
  if any of your bardic friends have shared any information on this subject. Cheers

  <b>A:</b> I did some checking around but didn’t actually talk to anyone who 
  had left Fennin Ro for another server if they were happy with the change. I’m 
  guessing that the feedback on the move was fairly good as there have been some 
  announcements that one or two more servers may be given an opportunity to split. 
  Sorry I don’t have more information on this.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Finally I stopped by to read through EQX more intensively. 
  Now my question: Is there any chance of getting an overview of Norrathian history/mythology 
  when I haven't played beta? I went through some posts on various message boards 
  and I started a database with all names and stories mentioned but I need more! 
  I've heard that you cant find much information ingame any longer... is that 
  really true? Well - just to know the fact that EQ isn't Quake IV but a RPG with 
  an astonishing background made me enjoy it much more :-)<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> My first, quite mischievous inclination, was to have you bombard Oghma 
  with tons of questions to get him going on writing about the lore and mythology 
  (religious and otherwise) of Norrath for all of us so you could find such an 
  overview right here in our pages. However, as he occupies that strange position 
  known as "editor" (along with Absor), he might do something totally unexpected 
  or even strange to this column in response to such a suggestion. I think I’ll 
  just offer some possibilities for you to research the history and mythology 
  of Norrath on your own. The best starting place, of course, is on the EQ website 
  (www.everquest.com will get you there), where you can study the character profiles 
  of the deities and read the historical outline given there. After that, you 
  might branch out and search more EQ fan sites for information, but I was surprised 
  to find (when I went to check this out) that I couldn’t quickly find a site 
  devoted to history and religion/mythology that had anything in addition to the 
  material offered on the official site (which by the way appears to need some 
  updating and filling in.) So my next suggestion is to search out roleplayers 
  (especially bards like the venerable Jythri who is "nearly" as old a bard as 
  me) in Everquest who have delved into the old stories of Norrath. Many of these 
  same players have, I’m sure, also participated in the historic quests so far 
  and they might be able to fill in the storyline for you. History and mythology 
  are also intertwined in the static quests on EQ and if you spend some time /hailing 
  various npcs that you encounter, you may find some fascinating stories hidden 
  away in their comments. I think you’ll find that whoever said there wasn’t much 
  information in the game, is quite wrong. If you ever come across my old friend, 
  the bard Gellor, still hanging about the musty libraries looking for the lore 
  of Norrath, tell him Nep sent you and see if he’ll give you a friendly tip or 
  two. I do sincerely wish you sweet fortune in your work as it seems to me we’d 
  all like to know more about the ancient times of Norrath.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Hail Nepenthia! In regards to the question: "Who is Xegony 
  and Druzzil Ro..." Xegony is the God of Plane of Air (NOT Plane of Sky; that 
  is Veeshan, the Wurm Queen). Druzzil Ro is the God of Magic. I do not know his 
  relationship to Fennin or Solusek. I hope that this helps both you and Durand.<br>
  Sincerely yours, Bulwyr Paladin of the Order of Mithanial 2nd Sword Realm of 
  Mithanial Marr <br>
  P.S.: (that's Bul-voy -- it's Norse, the 'r' is silent :)</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Thanks for writing. I did do some checking and Veeshan is indeed the 
  Goddess of Sky. Someone said that Druzzil Ro is actually a “she” and possibly 
  a child of Fennin Ro, but I don’t know for sure. Where is Aradune when you need 
  him? I guess Karana keeps him way too busy but if anyone would know, I guess 
  he would.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> I am enjoying my relatively short life as a dark elf shadowknight. 
  Indeed, I have taken great pleasure in the seemingly endless task of exterminating 
  those nasty, trespassing halflings in certain areas of Nektulos. But, I think 
  that my calling requires more of me, and in order to accomplish more, I must 
  find allies. It with respect to that goal that I seek your help -- (1) The trolls 
  in Grobb currently regard me "dubiously," which is fine if I want to duck out 
  of the swamp for a moment, but will not permit me to train in any of my skills. 
  Do you have any suggestions of how I can improve my favor with them? (2) Although 
  I have never traveled to Runnyeye, I have heard rumors that there is a goblin 
  bank there which is usable by evil races. Is that rumor true? If so, can I travel 
  there at present, or must I do something to improve my favor with the Runnyeye 
  goblins? <br>
  -Jekyll</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Well, I’m not sure if you really want a troll for an ally. Half elves 
  are so much more dependable and they eat a lot less too! However, if you insist 
  on getting friendlier with the trolls so you can train in Grobb, you should 
  be able to do it by killing ogre shadowknights or possibly a mob named Lynuga 
  (check the spelling). As for the bank of Runnyeye, it’s not an establishment 
  I’d care to visit often as the goblins around the banker don’t seem to appreciate 
  a business truce. However, multiple Pillars of Wisdom did assure me that there 
  is a banker in Runnyeye and if you make your transactions very quickly (and 
  aren’t too young for the zone) you can make use of him. Assuming of course, 
  you trust a habitué of such an awful place. </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Q:</i></b><i> 
  Hail Nep. It's Mithycan Wolfcaller again with another little tidbit for you. 
  You may not wish to print this however as it is a PC answer. This is an added 
  helpful item for Elexwiz in issue #118. While all character information is held 
  on the EQ servers, other things are not. For instance, your friends list, what 
  hotkeys you have set and all your socials buttons are kept on your local PC 
  in the Everquest directory (Default: c:\program files\everquest). In this directory 
  you will find various OPT extension files with you character name (8 characters 
  only). These are just text files and can be opened with Notepad or Edit. DO 
  NOT EDIT these files however, as they are very touchy. The bottom line is that 
  they are small and even 8 characters on all the servers would fit on one floppy 
  disk. For those who are moving to another PC, playing out of town or upgrading 
  to a new machine, it's good to copy these off and copy them back AFTER installing 
  EQ. I have personally added them to my backup so that (heaven forbid) my PC 
  crashes, I can come back to playing without having to redo all my buttons. One 
  other tidbit. If you run a character on more than one server, with the same 
  name, i.e., Mithycan on Rallos and Vallos, you will find that Mithycan has the 
  last hotkeys you set up. The OPT files are character specific and not server 
  specific. If you do not wish to print this could you please get it to Elexwiz? 
  Or maybe use it for others with the same questions?<br>
  Thanks, Mithycan Wolfcaller - Knights of the Bardic Order Rallos Zek</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Thanks very much for writing in and sharing such helpful information. 
  It’s also good to be aware that, very rarely, a file with an .opt extension 
  can have a problem and if you need to delete it, when you log in to EQ, the 
  EQ computers will patch it for you. If this happens, however, you’ll have to 
  redo your friends list and socials and hot buttons unless you have a backup 
  of them on a disk as Mithycan suggests.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> What would be one of the best video cards to use with EQ. 
  I have a V770 ( not the Ultra ) and have experienced a bad chop when entering 
  long hallways. I have a p2450 w/ 196mb ram <br>
  Darwind Healem</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Sadly enough, I don’t do tech! Well, anyway, if I tried to guess an 
  answer to your question, you’d quite likely blow up your machine and not be 
  able to play EQ at all. However, what I recommend are these two avenues: The 
  first possibility is to go to the official EQ website and check out all the 
  information on the video cards that are supported by EQ, then under "Contact 
  Us" you’ll find a link to Everquest Video Technical Support. I’d start there 
  and give them your system specs and ask if it is the card causing the problem 
  and if there is anything you can do short of buying a new one. If you have your 
  heart set on getting a new card, however, the second possibility would be to 
  try posting on the EQ main website message boards under the technical section 
  or choose your favorite EQ news site and try posting on the boards they might 
  have for technical questions. My guess is you will get more answers and suggestions 
  than you ever imagined possible. Good luck!</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> The current Q&A included the age old riddle about words 
  that end in GRY. The true issue is not the answer, but rather the question. 
  This Riddle is meant to be asked aloud. The exact Spelling of the question is 
  "There are at least three words in the English Language that end in 'g' or 'y', 
  one is angry, another is hungry. Name a third." the " 'g' or 'y'" part is supposed 
  to be pronounced "g-r-y", testing the listening of the person being asked the 
  riddle.<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Oh goodness, now this is one explanation that makes the riddle REALLY 
  hard. Thanks for writing in. </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Q:</i></b><i> 
  Yet another response to the -gry riddle. Seems even we genius Druids make mistakes. 
  "Angry and hungry are two words that end in -gry. There are three words in the 
  English language. What is the third word?" I mistyped last time and apologize. 
  This is also a reply to Issue 117 where someone makes another variation of the 
  riddle and I would like to say that this riddle was around long before Torment 
  was and the creators most likely got it off their e-mails some day :) Sorry 
  for the typo. (And the answer is still language no matter how you look at it!)<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Thanks for writing in. Now that we have lots of explanations and variations 
  on this riddle, I wonder what would happen if I said I was hungry enough to 
  munch this riddle to oblivion and would get angry if anyone else asks me about 
  it. I think the language would be quite clear. *Grin* </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank 
  you all for writing in. By the way, I happened on some very witty roleplay "blessing" 
  this week which I don’t have permission to print, so I won’t. But if anyone 
  has a favorite Norrathian god blessing they have seen players use, let me know. 
  I’d love to compile a set of them and maybe even publish them.<br>
