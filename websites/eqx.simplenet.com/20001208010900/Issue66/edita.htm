Well, my CD still isn't here.  That's a bit disappointing.  But I suppose it might arrive Saturday afternoon.
<br><br>
I hear that a lot of folks are having trouble connecting to the game servers.  I hear it because I read the newsgroups.  Lots of yelling.  Posts with titles like 'Verant is ripping us off!' and 'Verant should be sued!', except more often in all caps.  And I've read a few posts from folks that are willing to wait and let Verant iron out the problem.  Responses to those posts usually include the word (if it is a word) asskisser.
<br><br>
I'm certainly willing to say that having this level of connection problems the day of release is a huge mess.  I'm <em>almost</em> glad that my pre-ordered a month ago CD hasn't arrived yet.  And I can see how not being able to play would be very upsetting to everyone.  Event he most die-hard Verant supporters are disappointed with this problem.  I'm certain Verant is as well.
<br><br>
But then again, some things can't be predicted.  Nobody at Verant could have foreseen the problems with the UU.Net systems.  And if they had predicted the problems within their own system, they would have fixed them before releasing the game (or before opening the servers, at least).  But that problem just did not show itself until all of the folks joined up.  Now that they are aware of it, they are fixing it as fast as they can.
<br><br>
As for the asskisser comments.  I find it a bit disturbing that some people are so easy to assume that I (and others like me) are so easily fooled.  Perhaps our trust in Verant comes from having worked with them for a long while now, and from knowing that they are not only competent, but concerned.  It is not a bad thing to trust people, especially when those people have earned that trust.  Perhaps some people just need to find a more loving home environment, one where they can learn to trust again...
<br><br>
It all comes down to trust.  Too many folks are jumping up and down, seemingly pleased that they can point their fingers and yell "Look!  Look!  We've been ripped off again!"  It's almost as if they <em>need</em> someone to be angry at.  With only four days of partial down time, folks are already screaming lawsuit.  But listen, you've not given them a chance.  Believe it or not, tracking this sort of a problem is not such an easy thing.  And if you think that Verant is on vacation, laughing at all of us suckers that paid them money, you're wrong.  They are working to fix this.  And they will fix it.  If you really thought that they did not care, then you should never have bought the game.  I don't buy things from companies that I do not trust, I expect others to do the same.  That's what makes a capitalistic system work.
<br><br>
I had a roommate like that once.  He was never happy unless he was unhappy.  He just <b>had</b> to feel as if he was being put upon by everyone around him.  If the trouble in his life wasn't the fault of the Government, his teachers, his bosses, his girlfriend or his roommates, then he would have nobody else to blame but himself.  He had at least three accidents in his car during the three years we shared a house.  Not one of them was his fault, despite what the police, witnesses, the other drivers and his insurance company said.  He wasn't willing to examine his own life closely enough, so he expended his energy blaming others.  Even for things that were not really the fault of anyone at all.  Things that just happen.
<br><br>
The same thing goes here.  Sure, Verant is responsible for fixing this problem.  But it's not really their fault.  No reasonable person could have predicted this problem, and some of the best networking brains are working on fixing it.  If you are unhappy with what has happened, if you feel cheated, then sell your copy to a friend (you can probably find someone that is <b>still waiting</b> for his copy from some on line company and sell it to him, he can return his copy when it finally arrives).  But I suggest you just wait.  You'll be surprised how stable and fun EverQuest is.  The current trouble is a temporary and fixable problem.  From what I've read, even UU.Net is upgrading parts of their hardware to handle the load.  I'm willing to bet that all this shiny new equipment make things humm by, let's say, Monday night at the latest.
<br><br>
Because that's when my CD had better arrive!
<br><br>
<em>[Late note:  Seems I was wrong.  I just read on EQVault that the UU.Net thing is cleared up now and things should be working great.  Well, it's early Saturday morning, and UPS has not arrived... maybe my CD will come today!]</em>
