<p align="justify">Welcome to Issue 3.  Kit is taking some time off.  That leaves me here to mess up all his 
good work.  He may not be available for Issue 4 either.  So please direct any comments to me, 
<a href="mailto:alanvc@concentric.net">Absor</a>.  I would like to thank all those that have submitted 
articles for this issue, as well as those that are currently writing for the next issue. 
<br>
<br>
I also figure that the editorial section is the place where the editor gets to spout or rant a bit. 
And since Kit is not here to stop me...<br><br>
I just wanted to talk about the hoaxer that hit the Avault EverQuest news group, and maybe a few 
others as well.  Recently someone decided to post a false message from Brad McQuaid to the news group.  
This person attempted to convince us that EverQuest had been cancelled.  He also posted the the Tanarus 
group with a similar message about the cancellation of Tanarus.  Okay, so not too many people 
believed it (well... one good friend of mine was too ill to recognize the hoax. :) ).  So I am not 
going to say that he was a good hoaxer.  But I come to question the reason why someone would do this.  
Rumor has it that this person was ill treated in an IRC chat.  I have also heard that he has been 
banned from Tanarus.  So he chose to strike back at Sony Interactive Studios of America (SISA - what a 
long name!) by trying to anger and confuse potential SISA customers.  All I really want to say is: 
grow up.  Only thoughtful and intelligence discussion can actually influence people.  The only thing 
that the hoaxer has convinced me about is his own immaturity.  I guess nobody is surprised that I 
feel this way.  I suspect you all agree with me.<br><br>
That leads me to the rest of us.  Brad has mentioned to us that he likes to read the newsgroup.  I 
appreciate that.  He also told us that our endless rants make it hard for him to spend his time reading 
the news group.  So far I think the posters have handled it pretty well.  We have been mature and 
have held down the rantings.  I wanted to congratulate and thank you all for that.<br><br>
Well, please enjoy this issue of EQX!
