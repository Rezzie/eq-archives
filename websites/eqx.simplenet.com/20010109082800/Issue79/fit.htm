<b><em>(This years new attractions sees the introduction of the Daredevil Crocs of Marr who will attempt to leap the span of Beholder's Gorge)</em></b>
<br><br>
New shows this year include the never before seen Daredevil Crocs of Marr, who are reportedly preparing to demonstrate one of the most potentially lethal jumps of this age: A blind folded leap across the Gorge of Beholder, over 50 Evil Eyes and through three flaming rings of fire, while singing Selo's Accelerando a ccapella. Whew! Just thinking of it gives me the willies. And of course let us not forget the all time crowd catcher and favorite ... the contortionist spiders of Cirque du Arachnia.
