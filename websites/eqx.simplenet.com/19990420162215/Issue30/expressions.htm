Alright, I'll give it a shot.  But you will also find some very good ideas on this topic in Oghma's articles: RACIAL HATRED - BIGOTRY OR HARD-EARNED LESSON? <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue8/racism.htm">part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue9/racism.htm">part 2</a>
<br><br>
Let's take this in two parts.  First, exactly what is meant by "racism" in a fantasy setting like EverQuest?
<br><br>
It's not enough to just make a chart telling you which races hate other races.  Let's see here…  I'm gonna play a High Elf…  so I hate Dark Elves, I don't much like Dwarves, I'm neutral to Half-Elves, I like Halflings…  While that is useful information, it's just not enough.  Making an Ogre and then going out and stomping all the Humans you see just because some chart tells you to is a weak, if commonly accepted, role-playing practice.  If you are going to truly <em>be</em> your character, you need to know <em>why</em> he does the things he does, not just what he does.
<br><br>
Unfortunately we haven't been told very much about the history of Norrath.  We can't really draw from that as a source for our reasons to hate (and don't think that hate is not a big part of role-playing, but I'll get to that later).  But there are a lot of other sources in the vast tomes of fantasy fiction.  And I suspect that the history of Norrath will not stray too far from what we would read in those tales.  So here is what I would suggest to everyone that wants to play EverQuest, grab a copy of one of those books.  Now, I read Sci-Fi mostly, but I'll give you a few suggestions.  Maybe The Silmarillion (J.R.R Tolkien), a great epic history of Elves, and the common source for most Elves in most game settings.  Read any of the TSR books (various authors), though I can't vouch for their literary quality.  Oh, heck, ask around, you'll get a lot of suggestions.  Read whatever you have to to get the general idea.  Search the web for fan sites for EverQuest, D&D or whatever, and get a background on the kind of things that make up the history of the race you want to play.  But don't take them as law.  Wait to finalize your thoughts about the history of all the races until you the official history comes out.  But I don't think it will vary all that much from the established stuff.
<br><br>
So let's say we are going to start our adventures in Norrath with a Dwarf.  We've chosen Dwarf because we want to make a tough fighter that comes from a solid family.  We want him to be stoic and quiet.  But we want his convictions to run deep and strong.  When aroused he will be very passionate and will probably lose his control under certain circumstances.  Alright, that's a start.  But now we want to find out what really sets him off.  One of the best places to look is the history of his race.  In a story I've been writing I have made a few assumptions about the Dwarven race in EverQuest, and I'll use them here.  Dwarves live in the earth.  They share this space with the Dark Elves and the Gnomes (as PC races), the Gnolls, and other nasty NPC races.  Considering that there are limited resources, space, water, food, in the caves of the underearth, these races must certainly have come into conflict in the past.  Now, let's look at our Dwarf.  His grandfather was a great warrior.  He fought for years against the Dark Elves.  He fought because his father was killed in a skirmish with the Dark Elves.  This goes back so far in the legends of the Dwarves that nearly every single Dwarf alive can trace their lineage to a relative that was killed by the Dark Elves.  But worse yet, our character knows that the Dark Elves don't just kill their captives.  They use them for all sorts of slave labor.  In many cases, because Dwarves tend to try to escape a lot, they blind or hobble these slaves.  Our Dwarf has lost his older brother to the slave mines of the Dark Elves.  And many nights he wakes up screaming in rage from the same dream, the one where he finds his brother, blinded and missing his hands, in the lair of some exaggeratedly hideous Dark Elves.  Try as he might, even in his dreams, he is never able to rescue him.
<br><br>
"Racism" in this case is not the same as it is in real life.  In our world there are no real reasons for racism (alright, sure, social training...).  Folks that we call racist hate people for reasons of skin color or other things just as illogical.  But in EverQuest and other fantasy settings, there are real reasons to hate other races.  Every paladin character should look at a Gnoll and think 'that is an evil, vile beast and I should kill it.'  That is not a wrong thought.  It's pretty much a true statement.  Gnolls ARE evil.  So I guess the term racism isn't really an accurate one, but it's good enough.
<br><br>
The next question is how do we role-play this racial hatred without breaking the rules of etiquette that we hold each other to?  Can we curse at every Dark Elf we see?  Should our Dwarf immediately attack every Gnoll he meets?  No.  While the fantasy genre has made extremes its mainstay, we can't really apply them to our on-line gaming experience.  We need to make certain that we don't ruin the experience for the rest of the community we are playing in.  But we can, and should, certainly push those limits.  An example might help (let's name our Dwarf Drebbin):
<br><br>
Drebbin is traveling with a few of his friends.  He's been around these guys a while and they know him.  They know his history, his attitudes and his tendency for violent outbursts.  And they still like him.  We have spent time with these other players, and we know their limits.  They happen to be a rowdy bunch that have no problem with cursing.  They like to beat stuff up, so our Dwarfs violence is a welcome habit.  While traveling, we come upon a small party of Dark Elves.
<br><br>
Drebbin shouts, "Dark Elven scum!  I shall send you back to the darkness that spawned you!"  Heck, we have that on a macro! : )
<br><br>
Drebbin does not shout, "Dark Elven f***ers!  I'm going to kill you and rape you, then send your body home to your mother!"
<br><br>
That's obvious to me, I guess.  But after that do we charge them?  Do we try to kill them and run the risk of being called a PK?  Heck yes.
<br><br>
In converse, if we are playing one of those Dark Elves as a rogue and were to come across this scene from a different angle after scouting and see this Dwarf, based on our racial hatred our Dark Elf may want very much to kill this Dwarf.  There is no law of role-playing that says we have to yell anything at this Dwarf.  We might just wait until his friends have dragged him off (too many of them, Drebbin!  We can't take them all).  Then we sneak up on him in the night and stab him in his large Dwarven behind.
<br><br>
Look, EverQuest will be a violent game.  We will be in a world of killing and conquest.  I certainly hope that no one comes to play expecting all the characters to get along.  But on the other hand there is no need to make the game an unpleasant place for anyone.  If Drebbin comes across a young (read newbie) Dark Elf we probably should not take out our rage on him.  Perhaps there is no real in character reason for this.  But for the sake of the community of players, not characters, some sacrifices in role-playing will be needed.
<br><br>
If we put enough work into creating the backgrounds of our characters they will almost play themselves.  And as long as we are socially adjusted people in our own lives, we should never have to worry much about going out of bounds while playing them.
