RIVERVALE - Rumor has it that Clan Runnyeye has been assembling an army near Rivervale and Misty Thicket. Their objective is unknown, but it doesn't look good for the Halflings. The Mayor of Rivervale was unavailable for comment but a Deputy was kind enough to explain to us that a call for brave souls to battle the goblins had been sent to all neighboring allies. A group of adventurers that had been seen regularly in the area had been dispatched to invade Runnyeye to try and uncover the King's plans. They were last seen battling the King's Elite Guards, and have not been heard from since.

SOUTH KARANA - Bystanders reported that a brave group of men and women stood their ground against an angry cyclops rampaging through the Southern Plains of Karana on this day. None other than the Noble Aorn Sheperd, a cleric of Marr, led the group. His bravery is known throughout all of Antonica and portions of Faydwer. The battle was long, but with the skilled cleric leading the fight, the cyclops fell to its knees with no casualties taken. Most were in awe of the groups fighting prowess and all were thankful for the dangerous Cyclops being removed from the area.

OASIS OF MARR - This news just in. After dispatching of the cyclops, Aorn and his brave group of adventurers were called off to the Desert of Ro to defend the meek once again. This time the threat was worse. A Sand Giant had been terrorizing a local band of Gypsies. The vile beast was huge, angry, and most of all hungry for flesh. With great skill and bravery, Aorn and his crew stood toe to toe with the behemoth. Even near death they did not flee, knowing the Giant would only chase them and crush them into the dunes. The challenge was met though, and the Giant was beaten. If ever in need of assistance, call upon the these brave men and women, their skill is unmatched in all of Norrath.

QEYNOS - Tales continue to flood in reporting an "alternate universe",
slightly more advanced but less stable than the one we've been living in. 
Reportedly, the number of people there is increasing while our population
decreases.  Jovian Blannik of Erudin University claims there is no need to
panic.
 <br><br>
"It appears that both worlds are very nearly the same," says Blannik, "it's
functioning just seems, slightly more evolved than the natural processes
that take place here.  The shift in population suggests that we are slowly
being absorbed into that universe."
 <br><br>
Except for reports that the other universe is somewhat less stable, and is
now more densely populated than the universe we've grown accustomed to,
things should continue on pretty much the same as always.  But this does
nothing to assuage people's fear of the future.
<br><br> 
"I foresee a time," Blannik predicts, "when the world will evolve yet again
and perhaps the population will be so large that there will be two or more
concurrent universes.  And each of these universes will evolve at the same
rate and peacefully co-exist, side by side in the cosmos."
<br><br> 
Shortly after making this statement, Blannik was arrested for heresy and
burnt at the stake.
