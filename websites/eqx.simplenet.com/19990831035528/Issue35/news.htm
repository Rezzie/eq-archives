Have you ever asked a question on an EverQuest newsgroup only to be brushed off? Have you ever inquired or interjected about an inner game mechanic, such as the PK switch, only to be abruptly referred to the FAQ?
<br><br>
I realize this will be a big revelation to some readers: well informed people actually ask questions about Everquest precisely because they're not answered by the FAQ, on EQVault, Everquest Express, or any other EQ site.
<br><br>
Quite a novel concept, I know: people ask questions because there are answers nowhere else.  What amazes me, though, is the often curt attitude newsgroup posters express in response to such questions. For example:
<br><br>
Fred’s post oozes concern: This PK switch thing sounds great, but what’s to stop malicious PK-types from exploiting it, by keeping their PK switch off until they’re a high enough level? They can then switch the PK switch on and go on a killing rampage.
<br><br>
BobbyGLoser says: Jeez, another PK switch question? Read the FAQ, bub, and quit wasting our time.
<br><br>
Why are some posters so.. well.. rude? Is it because they’ve asked the same question themselves, but there's a deadpan of silence from 989 -- so they’re annoyed when anyone else asks the same, as yet unanswered question? Or are the BobbyGLoser’s of the world frustrated that they’re not beta testing yet, or EQ isn't yet on the shelves, so they take it out on others?
<br><br>
I guess not everyone keeps hoping for an extra tidbit to pop out of someone at 989 Studios, or for a bean to spill out of the bowl of some beta tester. Not that I encourage an NDA violation, but who wouldn't mind hearing about some as yet unknown inner game mechanic?
<br><br>
Even if it's still in testing.
<br><br>
Even if it isn't finalized.
<br><br>
Even if it hasn't been implemented yet.
<br><br>
So why the hostility to others who ask such questions? Asking questions and continually raising player concerns keeps things fresh in the minds of Everquest’s developers. So perhaps someone producing EQ will see the question and reveal a little tidbit for us to gnaw on.  And if not, what's the harm of asking?
<br><br>
Without entering the psyche of every ‘friendly’ newsgroup poster (no doubt a scary enterprise), I suspect it’s mostly caused by a typical affliction of the male species: impatience. We all want to know more about Everquest. We want in on the beta test. WE WANT TO PLAY!!!!
<br><br>
(cough)  =)
<br><br>
So what should you say next time poor Fred asks about the PK switch?  Perhaps something a more cordial. Try this: "Sorry bub, we’d all like to know the answer to that but 989 ain’t talking. How about letting out a juicy tidbit, Brad?" Or this: "We’re all waiting to find out." Or even: "Don’t know anything about that yet, but I’ll email you if something crops up."
<br><br>
Sure, not everyone will be friendly to everyone else. That’s a given. But needlessly alienating people who express an interest in, perhaps even a future love of Everquest? If anything, you should respect their interest in such a quality product (an assumption of mine, no doubt, but it has precedent). Surely you don’t expect to form or be invited into an adventuring party based on such behavior. And surely you wouldn’t expect earning the respect of anyone respectable with such tactics.
<br><br>
Then again, maybe it’s not impatience so much as a need to feel adequate. For many, that means talking down to someone else. Unfortunately that’s not limited to the inner realm of the online RPG.
