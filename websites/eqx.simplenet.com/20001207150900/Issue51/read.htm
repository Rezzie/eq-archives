Firstly we would like to thank 989 Studios and all the great folks on the development team.  Not just for letting us print material outside of the bounds of the NDA, but for their attentive, open and honest attitude with the fan community.
<br><br>
While EverQuest Express is able to print information about the game, it's staff members are still under the NDA.  This means that we can not answer your questions about the game by e-mail, in a chat room, on IRC, on a newsgroup, or anywhere else outside of this publication.  So please do not ask us to break our agreement with 989 Studios.
<br><br>
Also the release of the NDA to certain fan sites does not lift that same NDA from other testers.  Every individual that signed that agreement is still bound by it.
