Another week, another blank page to fill…
<br><br>
First, let me assure you that my character is no longer the magic item vat that he was last week.  I obviously jinxed myself by telling you all about my neato stuff.  A few puffs of fire from a hellhound and a few poorly rolled saving throws and the poor guy is just your average character again.  Heck, he's even worse off than that, having lost his spell books in the process.
<br><br>
Though this did bring up one of my major issues with the D&D system.  My character has just over 60 hit points.  The doggie from hell did 7 points of damage to me (and that is because I failed my saving throw!).  So how is it that such a fire could burn the robe off of my body and cause me so little harm that the weakest healing spell in my arsenal was able to cure it?  Burned that hat off of my head without singing a single hair.  Devoured magical items, yet barely warmed up the character…
<br><br>
That still bothers the heck out of me.
<br><br>
But then, it was my own fault.  One of those things that I shoulda known better than to do.  We had a shot at catching the Fire Giant leader in his bed.  Our leader (he's paying us, after all) scryed on the big jerk, and saw him sleeping snuggly in his bed.  His two guard giants didn't look too tough, and there were only three hell hounds.  We could take them, and we wanted to take them.  But as soon as we started peeking in on them, the dogs began to bark.  Our leader hesitated, so I yelled at him:  "Go now, or forget it!"
<br><br>
Stupid me.  We were in a hurry, but we weren't in that much of a hurry.  I rushed him, and he made a bad choice.  One that a warrior like him (warrior first, spell caster second) would make by instinct.  He popped us in right next to the leader's bed, and the doggie that was keeping watch at the foot of the bed.  For a warrior, closing to blade range is usually the toughest part of the job.  He put us where it was best for him.  And worst for me.  The doggie kept me from casting any spells by breathing all over us.  He also burnt most of my items to a crisp…
<br><br>
Yes, we managed to escape with our target, and to kill all three dogs and the guard Giants.  But it was a lot harder than it should have been.  And I got toasted, toasted badly.
<br><br>
The sad part is, it was really all my fault.  I had memorized a fire protection spell for exactly this situation.  But by rushing in, I did not give myself time to cast it.  Stupid me.
<br><br>
Sigh.
<br><br>
I'm not even going to tell you the worst part, because I don't know how much of this game is being run from the module and how much is being glurped out by the Nefarious One.  The tricks that he pulled on us were, I suspect, far to brilliant and evil to have been in a module.  But just in case the were, I won't spoil it for any of you D&Ders out there.  Let's just say that we're spitting mad now, and many, many Giants will pay for this before the next game is over…  that is if I can bum the use of someone's spell books for the duration…
<br><br>
(You know, every week that I write these things I keep thinking that I should stop doing it under the guise of 'editorial', since it's not, and do it as a bi-weekly column.  At least then I would be honest about it.  And honest about the fact that I can't write editorials…)
<br><br>
Let me at least mention EverQuest.  I tried something recently.  I started a character on the PvP server, Rallos Zek.  I've started characters there before, but rarely did I stick with it for very long.  This time I've managed to get a character to 8th level (or I should be by the time you read this).  I've discovered that the server is exactly what all of us think it is.
<br><br>
A lot of people claim that the atmosphere is far more 'realistic' and that the kind of psychotic PvP activity that some people complain about is not a big deal.  They say that the conflict makes the game more interesting, and that it adds to the role-playing aspect of the game, rather than detracting from it.  And that seemed to be true.
<br><br>
Others claim that the psychotic PvPer is rampant on that server, and that it creates an atmosphere of fear and useless struggle.  That it is a place where the obnoxious person is rewarded and the role-player is punished.  They claim that such a server is a concession to the ever-decreasing number of players that really want to play Quake, but play EverQuest like Quake just because it pisses more people off.  And that, also, seems to be true.
<br><br>
Yup, I'm an idiot.  But I'm also right.  Let me explain how these two things can be true at the same time by describing, in brief, the life of my character so far.
<br><br>
I created an Erudite because two of my friends had been telling us how much fun they were having playing on the PvP server, and they were playing Erudites.  I decided to join them.  I chose to play an Erudite cleric, figuring that nobody in their right mind would chose that combination for a PvP server.  It turns out that I'm wrong, one of those two friends that I mentioned was also playing an Erudite cleric.  Well, you know what they say, great minds think alike.
<br><br>
I managed to equip my character with his beginning spells and equipment and play an hour or two with my friends.  They helped me to get reintroduced to Erudin.  I had a good time.  But they were 4th level and I was second, and they were sucking all of the experience points away.  So I played alone for a few hours another day to catch up.  I haven't seen them since…
<br><br>
I played through my first five levels in Erudin and its surroundings.  Not once was I attacked by a player character.  I was saved from certain death twice by a helpful Erudite or three.  In all ways it was exactly like playing on a regular server.  I even managed to attack the Paladin guild leader three times in a row by forgetting to open the text box before typing.  That sort of experience amuses me immensely, and I was having a blast playing the character.
<br><br>
They are right, the mild fear that anyone could attack me, combined with the fact that nobody actually did, made for a slightly better atmosphere.  I knew to respect those with more power, and they still treated me fairly, as if realizing that some day I might surpass them and exact revenge.  All very interesting.
<br><br>
Then I decided to get on the boat.  At fifth level my cleric was getting bored.  And as a worshipper of Prexus it seemed my duty to travel the ocean and preach to the barbarian Humans.  So, I headed to Qeynos.
<br><br>
Now I'm not completely ignorant.  I knew Qeynos would be vastly different than Erudin.  And man was I right.  I got off the boat and wandered around a bit.  People looked at me funny, but nobody bothered me.  The dock area was squalid, though, and my priest wanted to see the rest of the city.  So I headed out to the front gate.
<br><br>
I was attacked immediately by a character (I think a warrior) that was blue to me (probably 4th level) carrying a two-handed sword, a bow, and a lot of arrows.  The sword must have been magical, I've never seen a 4th level character hit consistently for 19 and 20 points using any sort of rusty two-handed weapon.  And the Human guards did nothing to stop him.  I was standing between three of them being pelted with arrows, and they simply picked their teeth.
<br><br>
So I ran for the bard guild.  They seemed to like me, as I had played errand boy for them to help pay for my passage.  As soon as I zoned, I prepared to zone right back, just in case he followed me.  He didn't.
<br><br>
So, I figured to get into the whole thing.  I meditated and healed myself (he had me at half hit points), then went back to the gate.  I saw the villain in a battle with some other poor soul.  So I called upon the power of Prexus and blinded him.  His victim escaped.  I was pleased with myself.  Until the aggressor found me and again hit me with that big sword.  There was no way that I could kill him before he killed me, I'm an untwinked cleric after all.  So I ran again.
<br><br>
I played with this fellow for an hour or so.  Sitting nearby as he attacked anyone and anything that he thought he could beat.  I blinded him often.  I became quickly bored.  But my decision was made to move on when I discovered that the guards would come to his defense and not mine.  I blinded him while he was attacking someone amidst the guards, and the guards rushed ME!  I didn't have enough mana to Gate, so they sent me home the hard way.
<br><br>
I decided to recover my stuff and try again later.  I was unhappy.  Not only had I discovered that those other people were correct, that the jerks thrived on the PvP server, but I discovered what I felt must be several bugs with the guards on that server.  If my only experience with that server had been to start in Qeynos, I would have quit right then.  No wonder the population on that server keeps going down.
<br><br>
My next venture took me out into the Qeynos Hills, where I mercilessly butchered every furry thing that I could find.  In Erudin we don't have furry things and so tailored items, I figured, must be valuable.  I managed to gain a bit of practice making items that I couldn't wear (too big, too small…), and I gained 6th level.  Not once was I attacked (not even by those self-righteous ranger NPCs), and I was again feeling like the PvP server was a good thing.  And I decided to find larger, more useful prey.
<br><br>
I moved out to the Karanas to find myself some kitties to slaughter (creatures of the land don't deserve any respect from a cleric to Prexus, unless they swear loyalty to the lord of the oceans).  I did well, and managed to make myself a fairly complete set of patchwork armor.  Dang, that cleric looks great in that armor!
<br><br>
It was here that I started to form a theory.  The best way to make it on the PvP server is to hang out in areas above your level whenever possible.  In all my time in the Karanas I ran into three characters that were in the level range where they could have attacked me.  And I suspect that they were there for exactly the same reason that I was, to avoid people of their own level.
<br><br>
I've also become convinced that the best starting places for characters on the PvP server is any place that is not Human.  The Erudites were pleasant.  The Humans were often jerks.  My theory here is that people that are playing just so that they can pray on the weak hang out in Qeynos because that's the most likely starting place for new players.  Those that start characters on that server for role-playing reasons are probably more likely to play a race other than Human.  I'd bet money that Kaladim, Oggok and Grobb don't have the same sort of population that Qeynos has.
<br><br>
Me, I'll keep playing that character a bit and see how it goes.  It's been a more positive than negative experience so far.  And I've even got someone to take vengeance on later if I see him again.  I highly doubt that my twinked Human warrior pal has advanced in levels, since killing PCs does not give experience.  Maybe at 8th level I'll get the chance to beat him up.  But, luckily, that's not what I live for, even on the PvP server.  So if I never see him again (and I haven't since that first time), then I'll be just as happy picturing him still farting around outside Qeynos pointlessly chasing newbies around while I conquer the larger part of the game.
