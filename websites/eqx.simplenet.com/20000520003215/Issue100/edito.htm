During a recent visit home my father gave me a slim volume of philosophy entitled  <em>Finite and Infinite Games: A vision of Life as Play and Possibility, by James P. Carse (Ballantine, 1986)</em>.  In it are a list of principles of what the author believes are the two kinds of games that exist, and rules and conclusions about them.  I was so struck by these and their application to EverQuest and our styles of play that I decided that it would be perfect for our 100th Issue.  These principles and their discussion are actually the best retrospective I could think of - besides, are you sure you want this old dwarf to ramble on about his memories?
<br><br>
<blockquote><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least two kinds of games. One could be called finite, the other infinite.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite game for the purpose of continuing play.</em></blockquote>

This so exemplifies the two reigning attitudes (powergamer and role-player) in EQ that it stunned me.  Powergamers, as a whole, are <em>playing to win</em>.  Role-players are playing <em>to continue play</em>.  Without yet categorizing EQ as infinite or finite, we have a good sense of differing play styles and what they mean to EQ.
<br><br>
<blockquote><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a finite game is to be won by someone it must come to a definitive end.  It will come to an end when someone has won.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one respect, but only one, an infinite game is identical to a finite game.  Of infinite players, we can also say that if they play they play freely; if they must play, they cannot <b>play</b>.</em></blockquote>

	Our finite game is a game that has an end, and stops.  At the end of it, there is a winner or a team of winners, and it's clear who that is.  I like his point about free play because it points out what happens when we create a goal that becomes more important than the attitude of "play" or playfulness.   At least, this is true for me - when the game becomes a chore it is no longer fun.  There are times when I can motivate myself to really push to accomplish a certain in-game goal - but when that goal becomes the whole *point* of playing, I lose the sense of fun that I have when I play.
<br><br>
<blockquote><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infinite players cannot say when their games began, nor do they care.  They do not care for the reason the game is not bounded by time.  Indeed, their only purpose is to prevent it from coming to an end, to keep everyone in play.  The time of an infinite game is not world time, but time created within the play itself.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason it is impossible to say how long an infinite game has been played, or even can be played, since duration can be measured only externally to that which endures.</em></blockquote>

Doesn't this describe Norrath to a "T"?  When did the game of Norrath "begin"?  Was it in beta? Or is Norrath-time the time we should use to judge our length of play?  Will Norrath time ever end?  Even if Verant shuts down the servers, Norrath will continue, as it existed <em>before anyone even played</em>.  This newspaper you are reading existed before the game "started", and we write stories and discuss Norrath, and I'm sure that there will be others who will write about Norrath.  For this we mostly owe Bill Trost, who is the lead world builder for Norrath, and who has created an enduring idea that is coherent, interesting, and a good starting ground for adventure.  We can say that 'play' in Norrath will end when the servers shut down, but in a sense Norrath will always endure.
<br><br>
<blockquote><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finite games can be played within an infinite game, but an infinite game cannot be played within a finite game.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infinite players regard their wins and losses in whatever finite games they play as but moments in continuing play.</em></blockquote>

	Every battle we have in EQ is a finite game.  Whether bashing a fire beetle, or unloading on a sand giant, each fight is a finite game, with a clear winner (and loser, with a long run from their bind point, or a looted corpse).  The quests we do are also finite games, with the acquisition of experience, gold, or a quest item the criteria for winning.  These moments in continuing play are usually the kinds of stories we tell around the bar, after dragging the loot from the battles in from camp!
<br><br>
<blockquote><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the rules of a finite game are unique to that game it is evident that the rules may not change in the course of play - else a different game is being played.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play.</b>  The rules are changed when the players of an infinite game agree that the play is imperiled by a finite outcome - that is, by the victory of some players and the defeat of others.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone from winning the game and to bring as many persons as possible into the play.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason the rules of an infinite game have a different status from those of a finite game.  They are like the grammar of a living language, where those of a finite game are like the rules of debate. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules, or grammar, of a living language are always evolving to guarantee the meaningfulness of discourse, while the rules of debate must remain constant.</em></blockquote>

Imagine if, during a battle, the orc pawn was allowed to get 1,000 extra hit points if you hit him for just 1 point of damage in any round.  The rules of the finite game would suddenly have changed.  Now, if you, as a first level newbie, are running for your life.  What if, conversely,  a passing level 50 cleric buffed you while fighting the orc?  That is always a possibility, but still within the rules, as it is a part of the game.
<br><br>
The final section was to me, the most enlightening.  It says, essentially, that we will <b>always</b> have patches, and that is a Good Thing.  There will always be changes to classes, items, areas, spells, and skills.  It is always fluid, because we do not want a killer class, killer race, abusable skill, or abusable quest.  There will also be new things put into the game, like the items dropped by the recent invaders of Kithicor, or the new class armors in the Temple of Solusek Ro and the loss of rubicite.  Kunark, too, is a new addition to the "grammar" of Norrath.  We do not want the game to end. We want the game to continue to be meaningful.  If, in the course that quest for meaning, I lose a spell, or an ability, well, I'll just live with it, because I know it is for the betterment of the play of others.
<br><br>
Thank you for continuing to read EQX.  If what we do adds to your experience, tell others about us, and tell us about what you like.  I, for one, have really enjoyed being a part of EQX, this bunch of creative, stimulating, thoughtful, and above all FUN people to be with.  I hope, like the infinite game, our living grammar of Norrath will continue.
