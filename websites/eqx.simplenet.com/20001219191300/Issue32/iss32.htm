<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
An interesting question was asked on the Avault newsgroup Forum.Everquest.  Essentially, it pondered how to create an evil character who doesn't just run around arbitrarily killing people, but who instead is a force to be reckoned with… the kind of figure who inspires fear and disgust.

"Grampa, Grampa, tell us that story about how you played games when you
were little!"  The two young kids eagerly jumped into the old man's lap,
ready to enjoy the funny stories they have heard so many times before.

<center><big><b>Guilds In My Opinion</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
After careful consideration I have decided to cover a subject that affects everyone, guilds and how they interact both internally and externally. Recently I have heard people complaining about things such as maturity levels of the members, organization and activity of the guild and others such factors.  I am not sure if this is due to the quality of the guilds out there, the quality of the potential members, or just the fact that good online gaming guilds are hard to come by.  I will try to elaborate on some of the problems I see, give a general synopsis of what I feel a guild is, and also tell you the story of how I decided to join a guild.

A good while ago I wrote an article on <a href="../Issue8/racism.htm">racism</a> and another on <a href="../Issue9/racism.htm">racial interaction</a> in Everquest. With some of the information we have on how Norrath will be a seething hotbed of racial mistrust, I realized that we will probably all be playing racial bigots to a certain extent.  It's already happening in IRC<b>...</b>

I was indeed an artist.  I worked in blood.  I worked in bone.  Swords were my brushes and flesh my palette.  The gods watched and pondered and critiqued as I lay my works out flat on the ground in the gallery of battle, one atop another.  And I could still see the carnage I crafted as I lay in bed and attempted sleep.

Aren't kids just the greatest?  
<br><br>
I know I have talked many times about my children.  I have three of them, a boy, who is sixteen, and two girls, ages fourteen and twelve.  It's the greatest gift to watch them grow up, making the same choices I made when I was their age.   I'm glad I can say most of the choices they have made have been the right choices.  I suppose that means I'm doing a good job, as a young parent.

"You see anything, elf?"
<br><br>
The fabric of Edril's cloak rippled in hot, southern winds.  His hood was pulled far over his eyes to protect them from the sun, and his face was hidden in shadow.  "I'm not sure," he answered back as he surveyed the road before him with narrowed eyes.  Craning his neck upwards, the elf inhaled deeply and choked on wind-swept sands.  "But there is something here," he cleared his throat and continued, "something in the air."

You sit in a small golden grassed meadow in the Plains of Karana. For miles and miles there is no sign of life. You are utterly and hopelessly lost. In the distance you see a band of riders descending down the plains and they stop when they see you.

His father was Throm Foehammer, feared and revered dwarven warrior. Many an ogre felt the bite of Foehammer, his namesake: an unusual name for an axe, but that's what it was.  After a somewhat short but glorious campaign on the Northern front of Antonica, serving as commander of the dwarves in the Ogre Wars, he returned home victorious. Yet he felt something missing from his life, now that he was back<b>...</b>
