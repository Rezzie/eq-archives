<em>Dearest Oxesiess,
<br><br>
I am Minute Gnome.  Enchanter and Charmer of sorts.  I am writing you today because my rather large friend Pelorus, who is an Ogre Warrior, wishes to ask you a question.  Well since he is unable to read or write (And not so gently hung me upside down until I agreed) I have desided to scribe for him.  I will do my very best to be as exact in his words as possible.
<br><br>
Hey Der Ox!
<br><br>

<br><br>
I apologise, he has ran after something and is beating it out of its mind now.  As always, thank you for listening and your wisdom.

Dear MinutePelorus,
<br><br>
Hi ya's!  How'd ya's git such a LONG name?  Ain't it hard on da speakin and spell'n stuff?  Regard'n da question, I thinky I's can esplain... Ya's see, welpers I thinky it's like dis, it's JIST like gobbys.  Ayeps jist like dem.
<br><br>
Ya know, I's in da Permafrost, and I's a bash'n, and a smack'n and a taunt'n dat "I's seen better butts on a two day old dwarf corpse!", and a strangle'n and and a MAME IN AND den I's git REALLY Wound up and guts are flyin all over da Ranger and all over da WALLS and der's gooby guts in da snow, da armour, da weapons and on da gate cause dey flew in witty itty pieces really far off!  And DEN I's start'n get git all mad and zerked and stuff and WHAMO!  Bunches o gobbys shows up.  
<br><br>
Welpers I dunt likes it but, I's not gonna let me bashy friends git deaded so we's gots ta git away.  Know what happens?  All those tiny sucky butt gobbys dat were so scarit afore LIGHT UP like stinky err stinky..  ahhh Like dat tick-tock city!  I guess they thinky since da Oxes is so hurted from lots o bashy dat dey can kill me now.  So it could be jist like dat.
<br><br>
It could also be, dey a bunch o stinky wussys and scarit wiff out der Mommy round cause mommy yelt at daddy dat baby-cub was gonna git a poor wittle hurted bloody nose wiff out lots o big protection.  So Daddy went out and bought der stuff fer em.

hummmm...  it's kinda a thunker I's not figured out yet.
<br><br>
Ya know I know a woody elf ranger really well.  I's always thinky to meself, Oxes I thinky, how'd he git pointy ears and why he dunt like ta smack da bears round fer dinner?  So I asked him one day and he done tolded me dat he was a follower o Tunare.  So I's go, Dis Tunare made ya's likes dis?  PHAW!  Let's go bashy it and show it dat NO friend o da Oxes makes peoples way to short wiff funky ears!
<br><br>
Den da ranger tolded me, no no dat Tunare was da mother o all, and dat she was a goddess.  I told him, iffen she had done had all o us as kidos she'd have ta be.  But I's know fer a fact she's not me Mommy cause I's seen and meeted me Mommy and she was never called Tunare by no bodies.
<br><br>
Den da Ranger tolded me she was da Mommy o nature and had created da woody elves and a Snotty elves and stuff.  Dat she loved all nature thingys likes trees and plants and flowers.  So I's a lookin at da ranger, da ranger is a lookin at me, and I start gwafing.  I says ta him, iffen dat da case she sure messed up on ya's cause ya's dunt look like no stinky flower ta me.  Though in da pink girly plate mail hat I can sorta git da idea where she was a goin.
<br><br>
Den da ranger told me ta fergets it.  So I's said why?  He said jist cause and I said, but Why?  And he said OXES PLUEASE! So I's said, Okay dokay but ya's still should bashy da snot outta her fer make ya's look up at me all da time.  And he sighed and agreed wiff me.  
<br><br>
So we's runs a bit more and desipte me okay dokay I's still confoolzed so I's asked, who's daddy?  He said, what daddy?  I said da daddy dat created ya's.  I's said, I's not's a barb-cub and knows dat ya's can't have a mommy makes ya's, even a messed up one trying ta make plants, wiffout a daddy.  Den he stopped and so I's stopped and he said, Oxes ya's wanna bashy stuff or not?!  Well o course I's wanna bashy was jist ask'n.
<br><br>
So here's what I thunker abouts it, I think daddy done run off so they's not sure who or what's dey really are.  Is one o those great confoolzin thingys dat maybe not even a Holy can esplain.  I's hope I's given ya's some understand though.  Jist be careful on who ya's asks bout it cause even iffen ya's thinky dey a friend, dey are TOUUUUUCHY bout it!
