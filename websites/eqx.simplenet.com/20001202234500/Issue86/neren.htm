	It was going to be a bright and shiny day for young Neren.  Atop a tree in the Greater Faydark Forest, he watched the sun rise form its lair, banishing the moon.  He heard the morning calls of the wolves, the sweeping breezes, the twittering of the birds.  He watched an Orc hatchetman march his way to Crushbone, the headquarters of the evil Orcs.
<br><br>
	Neren found himself singing the battle chant of the war his father had fought and died in.  He was too young to understand the news back then, but now sorrow swept in.  Nine years have passed since that war, twelve years since his birth.
<br><br>
	He wished the battle had taken place at another place.  His father died at the entrance of Neriak, home to the evil Dark Elves.  The mystical life force called the "Reviver" that flowed through the good land of Norrath should have revived him at his "bind point."  However, the dark counterpart of that force - the "Banisher" - cursed Neren's father's soul into an eternal sleep and swallowed the energies of his corpse.
<br><br>
	Young Neren himself had died once before.  At the slash of a wandering Pixie's sword, he had felt his soul succumb to the earth.  It was a terrifying moment.  His soul was swept into the hands of the Reviver as the Banisher attempted to capture him.  He felt miserable and confused.  Yet with guiding comfort, he "flew" to the surface.  Then he burst into consciousness.  Neren found himself dressed in plain clothes with a small haversack filled with food and water.  He realized how kind and caring the Reviver was.
<br><br>
	Neren forced himself to hum another melody, only to realize it was a song his missing mother had composed.  His mother was a great bard.  She loved composing and experimenting with instruments, music, and magic.  Neren only knew her as a source of warmth: a mother and a kind storyteller.  She had personally taught Llienna, Duror's sister.  Duror was one of the many friends Neren had.  Now, she was gone…  He stopped and clenched his fists, releasing all his anger.  <em>I'll never be a good druid if I always break into these rages.</em>
<br><br>
	Again he heard he calls of the wolves.  He wanted to call back.  He felt so free.  Unclenching his hands, he looked up into the sky.  A promising future lay before him, and Neren was determined to take advantage of it.  The wind ruffled his hair.  The soft crunches of the Orc a few trees away were abruptly silenced.  A bird landed on a branch near him.  Neren beamed a smile at the sky.  It was going to be a great day indeed!
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Later that morning, he returned to the great Wood Elven city of Kelethin.  Crowds of travelers, merchants, tourists, and residents roamed the city throughout it's lifts, platforms, bridges, and ramps.  Wood Elves and High Elves bustled around, trying to sell goods while Dwarves and other visitors came to stare at the unique treetop city.  The clanking of the Gnome-designed lifts was a common sound along with the squeaking of wagons accompanied by merchants entering or leaving the city.  It disrupted the quietness of the surrounding forest, but the several druids and rangers of Tunare, the "mother of all goddess," circled the city, attempting to calm the animals.
<br><br>
	Neren saw a burst of magical flames.  He winced as a Human visitor massacred a wolf.  <em>Why don't the guards do anything?!</em>  But he knew why; the guards couldn't do anything to prevent this, unless they break the hospitality custom.  Followers of Tunare looked painfully away from the destruction of a friendly animal.  The Human stood up after looting the wolf's corpse, confused at the expressions of others.
<br><br>
	As Neren walked to the main lift, he heard someone say "Neren."  At once, he looked around for the voice's owner.  It was a High Elf talking to an Erudite visitor.  He realized they were talking about his father.  He thought about saying he was his father's son, but he naturally had that Elven instinct to hide from strangers.
<br><br>
	He stepped on the main lift, just as a young Wood Elf warrior pressed the control switch.  He felt the lift rise toward the platform which was about thirteen meters from the ground.  He found Llienna, one of his friends - Duror's - sister at the top of the lift.
<br><br>
	"Where's Duror?" said Neren.
<br><br>
	"At the Soldiers of Tunare.  You know - the druid guild.  I think he's waiting for you.  He's with Gilerrin and the rest of your little friends."
<br><br>
	Neren blushed at the word "little," but he, Duror, and the rest of his friends were six years younger than Llienna, except Lilandra who was eleven.
<br><br>
	"Oh by the way, I got something for you in the Bard Guild.  But it's not -"
<br><br>
	"Can I see it?"
<br><br>
	"- done yet.  Err… meet me when the sun reaches the highest tree.  Now go and play with your friends."
<br><br>
	Neren smirked at the word "play."
<br><br>
	"Can't I watch you?"
<br><br>
	"Er… but your friends are waiting for you."
<br><br>
	"But -"
<br><br>
	"Patience," she whispered soothingly, humming a pleasant song.
<br><br>
	Suddenly, everyone changed in Neren's view.  People suddenly popped up and many disappeared.  Neren realized he had just been mesmerized.  <em>Curse her!</em>  He admired Llienna a lot.  He always thought about her, imagining her singing up some bard "spells."  In fact, he wished he was a Songweaver, a Wood Elf bard, but he wanted to follow his father's path.
<br><br>
	It was ironic that his father had a warrior's blood.  But a priest of Tunare at Felwithe, the High Elven city a couple of miles from Kelethin, said his father had the gift of the druid.  Neren's grandmother, a very loyal and faithful person, followed the priest's advice and trained Neren's father as a druid.  Neren smiled.  He knew of the story when his grandfather got into a rage at his wife.  But she stubbornly persisted.
<br><br>
	He walked across the bridge to another platform and up a ramp to the Bank of Kelethin platform.  After talking to the banker and depositing the gold he had withdrawn earlier that day, just in case he walked by a merchant with an unsurpassable offer, Neren ran up the ramp across the bank, then down another ramp to the right.
<br><br>
	As he stepped on the platform he saw a building with a sign "Faydark's Champions" eclipsed by the platform's trunk.  Rangers walked in and out of the large cabin, talking energetically to each other about the present views of Tunare and the state of the Greater Faydark Forest.  He heard one person mention the name "D'Vinn."  <em>D'Vinn?  I heard that name before</em>…  Neren followed a fellow Wood Elf down a ramp right of the ranger guildhouse.
<br><br>
	Stunned, he watched Duror cast a spell amongst some of his friends: Gilerrin, Renidyen, Luegwen, Lilandra, and Aaldin.  Light green glowing sparks burst from Duror's hands.  The magic slowly enveloped him, forming an invisible protective barrier on his skin.  Gilerrin felt Duror's skin.
<br><br>
	"It's smooth…" Gilerrin said.  "Like wood!"
<br><br>
	Lilandra and Aaldin, both High Elves, also rubbed Duror's skin.  They agreed.  Neren also touched Duror's arm.  The rest acknowledged that Duror indeed had cast magic.
<br><br>
	"Isn't this great?  The Heartwood Master said it will protect from those evil bats and wasp drones.  It's called 'Wood Like Skin' - err - 'Skin Like Wood.'  Come on, Neren.  Llienna told me you wanted to be a druid too!"
<br><br>
	<em>How did she know?</em> thought Neren.  He followed Duror into the building named "Soldiers of Tunare," the druid guildhouse.  Heartwood immediately recognized him.
<br><br>
	"Hail, Neren, son of Neren NaturesWord.  Embrace Tunare!"
<br><br>
	Neren blushed; he was unused to such praise and honor.  Duror nudged him.
<br><br>
	"Yes, I would like to be a druid," said Neren.
<br><br>
	"Welcome then.  I must admit this little hut is inadequate for such a grand class, but Tunare had decided to accept Surefall Glades as her favorite place and announced it a holy place for druids and rangers.  But this will do."
<br><br>
	Neren didn't know what to say.  Duror nudged him again.  Neren glared at him, then turned back to Heartwood.
<br><br>
	"Yes, it will do… I guess."
<br><br>
	Heartwood hid a smile.
<br><br>
	"You seem unsure, Neren."
<br><br>
	"No, he want's to be druid!  Right," blurted Duror.
<br><br>
	It was Heartwood's turn to glare at him.
<br><br>
	"Duror…" he said.
<br><br>
	"Yes, I, Neren, son of Neren NaturesWord, will join the true ranks of Tunare as a druid."
<br><br>
	"You don't have to be that formal," mumbled Duror.
<br><br>
	Neren grinned stupidly at him.
<br><br>
	"Well said, young druid.  Now let's start.  You will need to learn how to use weapons though."
<br><br>
	Neren eagerness to wield a weapon almost made him jump out of his skin.
<br><br>
	"Now, never kill wolves, bears, jackals -"
<br><br>
	"He knows," cut in Duror again.
<br><br>
	Heartwood glared at Duror again.
<br><br>
	"Okay, now try this worn great staff out.  Battle me," said Heartwood.
<br><br>
	"What?!" said Neren.
<br><br>
	"It won't hurt much."
<br><br>
	Before Neren could say anything, Heartwood swung at his feet with another staff.  It caught his knees.
<br><br>
	"Ack!" shouted Neren.
<br><br>
	He collapsed.  <em>It hurts!  It hurts!</em>  He winced in pain and held his legs.  He heard a strange sound and felt magic soothe and heal his wound.  Neren slowly stood up, fearing a sudden shock of pain.  But his joints moved smoothly as if completely healed miraculously.
<br><br>
	Duror looked at both Heartwood and Neren in surprise.
<br><br>
	"I'm sorry. Perhaps we should use some other material," said Heartwood.
<br><br>
	"No I'm fine.  I just wasn't prepared, that's all," Neren said quickly.
<br><br>
	"Staves are very dangerous, you know."
<br><br>
	"Oh I know, I always fought mock fights with these, but I never could swing it hard.  I was fairly good with these then."
<br><br>
	"I see you're out of practice now.  You're holding the staff in an awkward position: right hand near an end, the other resting staff nearly vertical and a quarter meter off of the ground."
<br><br>
	Neren released the staff for a second, then caught it above mid-shaft while bringing his left hand to balance it below his right, all the time tilting the staff.  His legs were bent and spread, torso turned halfway to the right, elbows bent, and staff guarding his eyes.
<br><br>
	"Impressive," said Heartwood.  "Attack position.  Your father taught you that, right?"
<br><br>
	Neren returned to his casual state, using the staff for support.
<br><br>
	"Aye.  He also taught me some other positions, but he never fought any mock fights with me."
<br><br>
	"It's important to know that druid's don't fight with weapons often.  Druids aren't a 'melee' class.  We aren't trained for physical combat.  We don't charge into battle hacking our ways through.  Weapons are usually used for defense.  Picking up a staff is easier than suppressing panic from an ambush and concentrating to cast a spell.
<br><br>
	"However, spells and magic are our specialty.  The rangers may protect nature with swords, but we may preserve with magic."
<br>	<br>
"But don't rangers also learn some druid spells?"
<br><br>
	"Yes, but their spells are by far inferior to ours.  For example, a fairly low-level druid can cast the spell 'Strength of Earth.'  It takes a ranger more than three times the rank of a druid to learn and cast it  efficiently.  It is obvious that our offensive skills in weapons is rather trivial."
<br><br>
	"So how are we to train when we can't attack each other?"
<br><br>
	"We druids must also learn offensive skills in weapons.  Defending yourself and never striking back is no sure way to drive off your enemy.  Push the enemy away for a second to allow time for a spell."
<br><br>
	"It's just that many people like druids with them.  An enemy attacking a druid would be taunted off quickly by a melee class such as our brother and sister rangers."
<br><br>
	"Hmm…I see."
<br><br>
	"Come, let's fight," said Heartwood suddenly.
<br><br>
	Neren saw that Heartwood had been preparing for this.  He grinned and took the challenge.  He swung his staff at Heartwood's arm.  He heard a thud as the Heartwood Master's staff met his.  He brought his staff back and swung low at Heartwood's feet.  Again, Heartwood parried.  Neren tried a vertical then quickly a low horizontal swipe, but Heartwood was too skilled to fall for that.
<br><br>
	After a flurry of fighting defensively, Heartwood riposted with vigor.  Dodging a vertical swing, he sidestepped and tried to hit Neren's back.  Neren's staff was waiting.  However, Heartwood had the advantage.  Neren found himself pounced on as he turned around.  He fought desperately for an advantage.  Finally Heartwood scored a hit off Neren's shoulder.
<br><br>
	Neren sat on the ground, massaging his shoulder.  He grinned to the others.
<br><br>
	"That was fun."
<br><br>
	Duror had watched the battle in amazement.  Neren noticed his expression and offered him his staff.
<br><br>
	"Here, try it."
<br><br>
	Heartwood healed Neren quickly and turned to Duror.
<br><br>
	"Um… I don't think I can do this…" said Duror.
<br><br>
	"Come on, tough guy," Neren taunted.
<br><br>
	Duror took the bait and launched himself clumsily at Heartwood.  Heartwood easily deflected each attack.  Duror swung low at Heartwood's knees, due to his sluggishness and lack of skill, Heartwood was already behind him.  Duror failed to see Heartwood's staff come down on his arm as he tried to think of his next move.  Neren heard a resounding thud against wood.  He saw Duror slam into the ground on his side and roll over.  Duror looked in surprise at his skin.  Duror had suffered a minor injury where there should've been a broken arm.
<br><br>
	The Heartwood Master healed the bruise on Duror's arm and helped him up.
<br><br>
	"Duror, you'll need more practice later, but I need to teach Neren how to use magic."
<br><br>
	"Should I leave now then?"
<br><br>
	"You can stay."
<br><br>
	Heartwood turned to Neren.  Suddenly, a person burst through the door.
<br><br>
	"Uleen Laughingwater?" said Neren.
<br><br>
	"No time to talk.  Heartwood, a word please?"
<br><br>
	Heartwood stood silent for a moment, then nodded to Neren and Duror.
<br>	<br>
The two friends walked outside and resisted the urge to eavesdrop on the conversation.  They went up the ramp, to the Faydark's Champions.  They found Gilerrin and Renidyen talking to each other.  They were obviously bored.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin noticed Neren and Duror.
<br><br>
	"Hey, we got company."
<br><br>
	Renidyen, a half elf, saw them.
<br><br>
	"They kicked you out for talk right?"
<br><br>
	"They?" said Neren.
<br><br>
	"Laughingwater and Heartwood."
<br><br>
	"Aye," said Duror.  "Did Dill, Ran, and Maesyn kick you out?"
<br><br>
	"Ran wasn't there, but yes, Dill and Maesyn wanted to hold a conference and asked us to leave."
<br><br>
	Meanwhile, they heard some shouting inside the ranger's guildhouse.  Gilerrin and Renidyen turned around and watched the building closely.  The shouting fell silent, only to rise again after a few moments.
<br><br>
	"This is getting strange," murmured Duror.
<br><br>
	"Aye," said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	"I wonder why Laughingwater's here.  He shouldn't be here."
<br><br>
	"Tunare!  He should be on the boat to Freeport right now," said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	Laughingwater came to Kelethin on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.  He occasionally came Wednesdays, but never on Thursdays.  Recently, Laughingwater left Kelethin to do some business in Freeport, a Human port and city.  Freeport was months away from the continent Faydwer though; it sat on the largest continent Antonica, which overlooked the vast ocean between the two continents.  The ocean was called the Ocean of Tears after the many dangers on the islands and in the sea.
<br><br>
	The newly made ship, the Stormbreaker, built in the Kaladim docks, was given the challenge of transporting passengers across this ocean.  It was the finest ship ever built on Antonica, designed by Antonius Bayle's finest craftsmen and created by the dwarves of Kaladim.  Bayle's grandson had visited Faydwer only a few months ago and remarked the sturdiness of the ship.
<br><br>
	However, it was very unusual that Laughingwater came to Kelethin this day.
<br><br>
	Without warning, the doors of the Faydark Champions flew open.  Tuluvdar, a retired ranger merchant, ran past them to the druid guildhouse.
<br><br>
	"Tuluvdar?" Gilerrin called after him.
