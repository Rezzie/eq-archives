Last week I was trying to explain to you how the characters in our local campaign were growing powerful more rapidly than they were growing mature.  Oddly enough this came to a head the very next day (I waited until the last minute last Friday to write my editorial, and I think it showed, sorry 'bout that).  To explain what happened I'm going to have to go over a bit of background that I may or may not have covered before.
<br><br>
Our characters were pulled from many disparate worlds to work for an extremely wealthy merchant, one whose empire spans many prime material planes.  We were hired more for our potential than anything in our past.  We were brought to Sigil for our first bit of training.  Sigil is the center of the multiple planes, similar to Amber in the Zelazny novels.
<br><br>
From then on we were sent on missions for our boss.  For the most part those missions consisted of attempts to improve his position on one of the prime material planes (like Shadows of Amber in those Zelazny books.)  And we did well.  We've moved up the ladder in the organization.  So much so that we are now equal to the man that was our supervisor on that plane.
<br><br>
When the game began again last Saturday we were told that there were no real missions for us to undertake, so we were sent on a 'vacation'.  This vacation was of the working sort.  We were to visit a new fort.  This fort was established only a few years ago, and was ruled by a newly landed nobleman named Guido (yup, but I didn't name him).  Our task was to ingratiate ourselves with this new lord so that our boss' organization could set up some sort of trade agreement with him.  If we were really good, we would be able to secure an exclusive agreement.
<br><br>
Our group for this trip consisted of five people.  Let me introduce them to you briefly, based on what I know as a player.  One is Wylan, a pixie.  Wylan distrusts psionics, apparently someone used those powers on him in a way that hurt him very much.  Ryan Shadoe, aka Tempest, a human from an Earth similar to ours.  Ryan was once perhaps the most powerful superhero on the planet, robbed of his powers by a dead (undead) enemy.  Morden, a mixed breed psionicist.  His lineage includes nearly every race you could imagine, and his training in the power of the mind makes him a very useful party member.  Obviously Wylan doesn't trust him.  Darius, a human Chronomancer and hater of Goblins.  Something must have happened in Darius's past to make him hate Goblins so much.  He has shown that he can see the future, although the reliability of this power is still in question.  And Web, the Half Giant, shrunk down to fit into this world by magics cast on him in Sigil.  Normally eleven and a half feet tall, he's a tremendous warrior, especially since he carries his gaintish strength with him in his new form.
<br><br>
The trip to the fort itself was uneventful.  Once in the fort, we found that it was certainly in need of a supplier of goods.  Everything that was on sale there was two or three times as expensive as other places.  And what <em>was</em> for sale there was very little.  Stew was a good meal.  Mats on the floor were the only room for rent.  Not the only available room, the <em>only</em> room.  So we knew that there was a market here.  But we also knew that it would take some work to get the eye of the Lord Guido...  (I tell you, I did NOT make up that name!)  We poked around and found that the only interesting rumors involved "the hill".
<br><br>
This fort is on a large river.  The river is broad and deep.  There is no passage, no fjord.  And the humans stay on their side of the river.  On the other side of the river is "the hill".  That's where the adventurers go.  They say it's loaded with Goblins and other nasty things.  The Lord Guido (... nevermind) gives one copper piece reward for each Goblin head.  Not really worth it, but it was the only lead we had as to what this guy wanted done, so we crossed the river and headed for the hill.
<br><br>
Out in the hills we encountered a lot of the stuff that you might expect.  In order to cross the river, Wylan changed into a large eagle and flew us across one at a time.  Darius was the first one dropped off.  He was ambushed by a huge Komodo/Chameleon...  A giant lizard that looked like it was the odd child of a Komodo dragon and a chameleon.  He beat it before we could come to his aid.  We were impressed.
<br><br>
Our first trip was short.  We headed back to the fort right away.  But we went back to the hills the next day, bringing with us supplies for several days.  After a few minor encounters, we decided to camp.  In the night we were attacked by Goblins.  In fact, we were attacked often by Goblins.  We fought bunches of stuff.  After several days, we returned to the Fort.  While we did kill several Goblins, we decided not to bring back their heads.
<br><br>
When we returned we started talking about what we could do.  It came to Ryan that with the use of his Invisibility spell, we could actually attack the Goblins and probably come up with a major victory.  Wylan had already tracked some of them back to one of their camps and had seen about a dozen of them there, with a few of their wolves.  With the element of surprise, we could surely defeat them.  So we planned again to head out to "the hill", this time with murder on our minds.
<br><br>
The trip to the camp would take about one full day.  But we didn't want to arrive at night, so we stopped long before nightfall so that we could plan our attack for the early morning.  For the players it was nearly 11:00 pm, and one of our players was about to leave.  He always leaves at eleven (something about being married...).  But the GM, evil person that he is, convinced him to stay, just for this one more battle.  As the characters approached the camp, Ryan stopped.  He was, suddenly, having second thoughts about all of this.  He wasn't all that certain anymore that they were doing the right thing.
<br><br>
Ryan comes from a world where there is no such thing as pure evil, at least not for a whole race.  A world where thinking that race is enough of a reason to kill someone is wrong.  He comes from a place where there is, after many years of thinking otherwise, only one race, the human race.  And he was introduced to the concept of other races, like Orcs and Giants, in Sigil, a place where the races mingle.  They are not all friendly to each other, but none is attacked outright just for the color of his skin and the shape of his body.  And now he had come up with a plan to murder a bunch of people just because they were green.  He had been hearing that these people were evil, and had just taken it as truth.  But now he had to question it.  He had killed several Goblins in the past, but every time they were the ones that were trying to kill him and he was only defending himself.
<br><br>
So Ryan stopped and asked someone to explain to him why they were about to murder these Goblins.
<br><br>
The question didn't really even make sense to some of them.  Darius had always hated Goblins.  Where he comes from they are evil.  There's no question about it, they just are.  For Wylan they were a common enemy, and he never doubted their evil nature either.  In fact, none of them did.  But Ryan was unwilling to accept that.  He believed that they were victims of the prejudices of their parents and their societies.  Ryan needed more proof that a whole race of people could be born evil.  He asked that the group capture one and that Morden probe it's mind and tell him what he found.
<br><br>
There was much argument about how to do this (the group was <b>not</b> happy about this whole idea, but they were willing to go along with it).  During this time we heard a voice.  It was an angry voice.  Out from the woods came an Elf.  This Elf had met us on our way into the Fort and had cryptically told us that if we needed him, we should call for him.  And now, here he was.  He berated us for being stupid, telling us that Wylan could easily snag a Goblin for this stupid test.  Wylan demanded that this newcomer tell us exactly who he is and why he was following us.  The Elf was not there to be questioned, and scoffed at him.  Then Web drew his blade and insisted that he tell us what we wanted to know.  Ryan told everyone to calm down, and that the Elf had not hurt us.  He seemed an ally.
<br><br>
The Elf huffed at us and left, calling us fools all the while.
<br><br>
By now Ryan had decided that this kidnapping really wouldn't prove anything.  We might get one Goblin that was the embodiment of evil, but that would still not convince Ryan that every Goblin ever born was evil.  The party was prepared to skin Ryan alive.  He had come up with this plan, trekked all the way out into the hills, only a few hundred yards from the Goblin camp, and then <b>changed his mind!</b>  They tossed up their hands.
<br><br>
Then, only a few minutes later, the Elf returned.  He had with him a Goblin.  He gave it to Web, and told us that maybe now we could solve our dilemma.  Of course now we no longer needed the Goblin.  Surprisingly, Web only tied up the creature.  We left it there and headed back to the fort.  The Elf was angry and flustered.  He disappeared into the woods.
<br><br>
When we got back to the fort we discovered that it had been attacked the night before.  By Goblins...
<br><br>
Ryan is my character.  He's a Lawful Good magic user.  He grew up in a world not unlike ours, where any form a racism is shunned.  He once held so much power in his hands that he could change the world.  And for a while he did.  But he became corrupt.  He allowed himself to become comfortable with that power.  After helping to stop the third world war, he became a hero.  He started a business that was held together by the power of his name.  He let that make him lazy.  He stopped helping people and withdrew.  And then he lost that power.  He went into hiding.  Old enemies hunted him.  He found that, as long as he didn't tell people who he was, strangers would take him in and help him.  He remembered why it was that he had started out helping people in the first place.
<br><br>
Then he was offered a chance to learn ways to regain his powers.  He was taught how to use magic.  The spark that once gave him super human powers on Earth, was still enough to power spells.  He vowed that he would never let power become all that he was.  And that includes the idea that might does not make right.  And so he could not murder those Goblins.
<br><br>
Of course this weekend he has a whole new dilemma...
<br><br>
It might have been our fault that the Goblins attacked.  During our wanderings on "the hill" we killed maybe a dozen of them.  Perhaps they attacked the fort because of that.  Many humans and Goblins died in that battle.  And it might be our fault.
<br><br>
You should have seen the look on the Lord Guido's face when I suggested to him that he should end the bloodshed by not retaliating against the Goblins...
<br><br>
And our poor player, the one that stayed late just for that one more battle, didn't get that battle.  He didn't leave until around midnight.  Sorry, Jim.  Hope the wife didn't beat you up too badly.  :p
