At the close of the 12th century, the young daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine came to
the glittering court her mother had created in Poitiers and was placed in charge of
the education and training of the younger members of the palace.  Unlike the nobility
in the court of her father, King Louis VII, the young nobles in Poitiers were a
bunch of rowdy braggarts and young women experiencing court life for the first time
after being cloistered in small family estates.  This remarkable young woman, Marie
de Champagne, set out to guide the energy and desire overflowing from young hormones
and instructed her clerk, Andre the Chaplain, to write a book on a code of behavior
concerning love.

His "Book of Loving Nobly and the Reprobation of Dishonorable Love" set the ideal of
chivalry and courtly love which dominated the next 3 centuries.  It outlined a set of
rules under which the woman was the mistress of a love game where a young knight is
consumed by the pure passion for her attention and notice, a radical notion in a
world where women were little more than breeding stock and the living document of
property transfer. The young knight would sing of his love for the young woman,
describing her beauty and his passion for her.  He would sing of trying to win her
love, and of her occasional signs of encouragement - a dropped flower, or a hidden
glance.  If unsuccessful, he would sing of his despair, or renewed hope and
determination.  The ideal of a woman controlling the fate of her suitor was a sharp
departure from the reality of the time, yet set the tone for much of the later
medieval poetry. (You go, girl!)  It was in this heady mix of love, money and power
that the troubadour reached his zenith.

The medieval troubadour, later called a trouvere when the courts moved to the north
and Old French became the dominant language, was a poet and composer.  In those days
almost all poetry was intended for singing, so that the crafter of a poem must also
create a melody to match.  Not as many skilled poets were skilled musicians, so a
melody was often recycled to match a poem. Nonetheless, the troubadour period
resulted in the over 900 meters and forms of stanza which can be found in the body of work that
remains.  In a sort of quiet literary revolution, the troubadours and trouveres wrote
in the local vernacular, not Latin. Both troubadour and trouvere mean "discoverer" in
the two main languages of early medieval France.  The troubadour would travel from
court to court in France, Spain, and Italy, singing his poetry and sharing news and
gossip of the courts he had visited.
