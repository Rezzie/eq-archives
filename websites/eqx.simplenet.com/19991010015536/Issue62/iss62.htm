Antonius Bayle surveyed the encampment before Surefall with satisfaction, nodding to himself, and occasionally sending an aide with orders to one company or another.   The forces from Qeynos were arranged in a wide semi-circle in front of the tunnel entrance, and stretched from the river almost to the skeletal ruins.  A contingent of Clerics had cleared it of the undead as the army approached, and now camped there, sanctifying it with prayer and holy magic.  The last thing he needed was to be flanked by some ambitious Necromancer, hoping to win favor with the Gnolls.

Winter paced back and forth along the catwalk, growling.  Leaning against the rail, intently sharpening the head of a hunting arrow, was Maesyn True, Ranger Guildmaster of Kelethin and unquestionably the greatest hunter in all of Faydwer.  Periodically, he would lift his gaze to the pacing half-elf, then return it to his work.
<br><br>

"Dammit there must be SOMETHING we can do!"  Winter turned and glared at the elven Ranger, her eyes clear and cold as her namesake, furious that he could remain so calm and collected.

My interpretation of role playing the first few levels of ANY character in
EQ:
<br><br>
"Scene: JOE the noble high elf Paladin and his companion BILL the high elf
Wizard are standing at the gates of Felwithe. They have long prepared for
this moment. They have honed their role playing skills. They have created
extensive histories. They are ready."

Phase 4 is in my grasp!<br>
Another week and I'd have gone insane,<br>

I slash at the mail, the paper rips away,<br>
As if 'twas touched by Death.<br>
I jam the game in my CD tray,<br>

I had my family over the other night for a day of visitation and dinner.  After a great meal, prepared by my wife, I took my dad down to the computer room to show him some of the networking projects I had been working on for the last two years.  After about five minutes of looking at network topology drawings, I was sure I was loosing his attention so I fired up a few games to show him where the technology was going.  I myself have always been excited about how far the gaming industry has taken us.
