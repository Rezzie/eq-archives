One day, Purukivel the troll shaman decided to make a rare trip to Neriak, city of the dark elves. He threw on his chitin armor, struggled into a crude leather harness from which dangled various wooden chests and rawhide sacks, picked up his glowing staff, and set off in a great clinking and clanking of gear. He paused just long enough to roll a granite boulder in front of his cave's entrance, shouting out, "Me goin' away on big journey, you other trolls not steal me stuffs!" He glared perfunctorily at his neighbors in Grobb, baring his yellowed fangs briefly, confident this would be enough to discourage thievery. Luckily for him, the prestige of being a shaman gave him some protection from petty crimes. Realistically speaking, of course, there was no door or barrier that any troll could make that another troll couldn't batter down simply by charging at it headlong. Most, however, feared the wrath of Innoruuk sufficiently to leave his servants unmolested.
<br><br>
Be that as it may, Purukivel strolled off without a further thought on the matter, making his way through the crowded and muddy lanes of Grobb, which doubled as open sewers. He squished happily through the muck, delighting in the smells of blood and rot that permeated the air. A heavy mist had rolled in from the swamp, blotting out the thin trails of smoke from the handful of campsites where human squatters perched precariously on some of the drier ledges. Purukivel's nose wrinkled in disgust as he flicked a contemptuous gaze over these pathetic skulkers and their strange activities. He had little trust for creatures that ruined good meat by waving it over a fire. He shook his head. Silly humies!
<br><br>
Jumping into a rank and stagnant pool of green water, he swam quickly to the far side and leaped out to confront a grizzled shop-troll standing behind a worn plank table. Pointing to a mildewed bucket full of squirming worms, Purukivel demanded, "Gimme dat!" and reached for it greedily. With a loud screech, the old shop-troll picked up a spiked club and slammed it down on the shaman's grasping hand, extending his first counter-offer, and the negotiation were on.
<br><br>
After several minutes of squalling, bickering, and wrestling, the two trolls came to an agreement. "Two gold shinies," the vendor growled. Purukivel shrugged and fumbled out a couple of greasy gold pieces, dropped them on the counter, and grabbed the bait bucket gleefully. He was a renowned fisher-troll and had cast his line in many an exotic locale, from the subterranean gator pools of Guk to the scum-choked fountains of the haunted Estate of Unrest. Other races had learned long ago the benefits of spreading this skill amongst Purukivel's brethren. The humans had an apt saying: "Give a troll a fish, and he will bash you on the head and take the rest; teach a troll to fish, and he might leave you alone."
<br><br>
Satisfied with his purchase, Purukivel scampered away, at least to the degree that an eight-foot-tall hulk weighing four hundred pounds could be said to scamper. His squat, powerful legs churning through the thick mud, his long arms dangling loosely along his sides, he ran up to the fortified tunnel entrance to Grobb, shoved past one of the guards, and splashed out into the Innothule swamp.
<br><br>
Here he paused on the narrow bank of packed earth, pounded firm by the thudding footfalls of generations of lumbering trolls. The miasma of decay and corruption was a fine perfume to him, a savory olfactory soup of swamp gases. The outside guards yelled at him menacingly from their campfires, too lazy to get up and chase him. He thought back fondly to his cub days, when old Bakrok and his comrades had given him more than a few savage beatings, just the thing to toughen up a young troll. Reminded of these bygone times, he looked out to the nearby island, where callow troll youths romped about in a carefree way, armored and armed with only loincloths and tree branches respectively, hooting loudly as they chased snakes and rats and the occasional lesser kobold or two. Ah, ta be young agin, he thought nostalgically as he stepped casually around the scattered carcasses of inexperienced trolls who had strayed too far from the halfhearted protection of the guards. Those were da days!
<br><br>
Casting wolf-feet on himself with a flare of blue light, he set off. Naturally, he was tempted to halt near Guk to smash a few frogloks, a sport trolls found both filling and fulfilling, but he regretfully passed up the chance. Too many paladins from Qeynos lurking about, bellowing threats and insults at passersby. This was most annoying. Trolls didn't hide in the Karanas to ambush adolescent humans on their first gnoll hunts; why did Qeynos send out so many warriors to protect the weak but tasty frogloks? It was quite baffling. If the tuk and gaz knights inside Guk wouldn't sally forth to defend their young, why should the paladins care? Purukivel grunted. There was just no figuring humans out.
<br><br>
Leaping over gnarled roots, scrambling along slippery hillsides, diving through murky bayous, the shaman made his way speedily through the swamp, eventually reaching the ravine leading to the wide valley of South Ro. With the great endurance typical of his race, bolstered by his own spells, he was scarcely even winded by this miles-long dash. He paused only a moment before pushing on.
<br><br>
In South Ro, he ran along the wooded hillside of its verge, laughingly taunting orcs as he passed their camps. He soon crossed over into the arid sand dunes, giving a wide berth to the ancient tumbled ruins and the dervish camps, not so much from fear but rather to avoid the temptation to join one of the wandering adventuring bands hanging about these sites, ready for battle and plunder. As enjoyable as a good fight or two--or a dozen--might be, he had a long trip still ahead of him.
<br><br>
In the Oasis of Marr, he dodged whole hordes of angry orc priests, delusional desert madmen, rampaging sand giants, and shambling crypt mummies. In North Ro, he raced past huge sand scarabs and desert tarantulas. In the remote mountain valley of the East Commonlands, he just barely made it through a gauntlet of kodiak grizzlies and griffons and was just lucky enough to outrun a shouting Sergeant Slate. In the gloomy Nektulos Forest, though, the only real danger he faced was tripping over the vast heap of corpses stacked up in the steep defile that was guarded by a vicious dark elf regiment. The shaman grinned a bit at the sight. Given the similarly chilly receptions he'd often been given in nearby Freeport, it was rather satisfying to see how the sanctimonious dwarves, wood elves, and humans had fared in this region. Turnabout was exceedingly rewarding. His only regret was the paucity of dead hobbits. Due to a bad experience once in Rivervale, he did not like those little people, no, not at all.
<br><br>
Finally, he passed from the green dimness of the forest into the welcoming blackness of Neriak's foreign quarter. This enclave was jammed into a large cavern separate from the main vault of the dark elf city. Its streets were packed with jostling crowds of ogres, trolls, evil elves, and a scattering of outcasts and rogues from the lesser races. Merchants loudly extolled the virtues of their wares in five different languages, priests showily engaged in ritual incantations, roving squads of guards eyed the residents with bored disinterest. Insignia and glyphs gleamed in muted purples and golds on the walls in intricate patterns of esoteric meaning. The air was cool and dry, though the splashing of water could be heard from the large marble fountains. Usually those areas would be magnets for beggars, at least in human cities, but the stronger races had little patience for such wretches. They were quite willing for their own part to try to cadge a few coins from weak-willed elves or gnomes, but were more likely themselves to give a beggar a kick to the head than so much as one worn copper.
<br><br>
The streets were a little too narrow and neat for Purukivel's tastes, but the quarter was soothingly dark, and it was good to see so many of his brethren and their allies assembled together, busily trying to cheat or extort each other. He looked on approvingly as an ogre warrior expressed his displeasure at a vendor's prices by wrenching a ceiling beam out of its braces and using it to pummel the merchant, who good-naturedly signaled the loitering guards to riddle the customer with poisoned crossbow bolts. The ogre growled and went waddling off for the Nektulos exit. Ah, just like Grobb!
<br><br>
Purukivel took a room in an appropriately secluded inn where the sullen staff took little notice of his comings and goings. He spent the next few days wandering the quarter, selling some accumulated loot, buying new spells, brawling with other trolls, and boasting of his recent exploits. Being in a giving mood, he also cast wolf-feet on those sniveling souls that groveled before him, entreating him for this and other useful shamanistic spells. And in the evenings, only distinguishable in the enclave's perpetual twilight by the sudden influx of trail-sore human and half-elf rogues, he guzzled down gallons of ale and fish wine.
<br><br>
Upon a particular such outing to the tavern, he chanced to encounter his old friend Numinaeth, a youngster of only a couple of centuries. This worthy was even more morose than usual, which would be saying a lot in the case of either a dark elf or a shadow knight, and all the more so for one who happened to be both, as Numinaeth was. Gloom and despair seemed to gather about him in palpable clouds, and his eyes, usually aglitter with malice, seemed dull and glazed. Two empty blood wine bottles were his only companions; the other patrons were gathered in a circle to one side of the room, cheerfully torturing a captured hobbit druid. Purukivel looked longingly in that direction, but shrugged and clomped on over to join his friend.
<br><br>
In short order, the cause of Numinaeth's woes emerged. After a drunken tirade against the habits, morals, and ancestry of humans, followed by a rambling diatribe against his many bitter enemies, the shadow knight lapsed into a brief silence, staring moodily into his crude clay mug. Finally he sighed heavily and cast a hesitant glance at the troll. His skin blushing a deep purple, he mumbled, "There's this woman..."
<br><br>
Purukivel rolled his eyes. Even in troll society, most sad tales began this way. He thought briefly of his long-ago crush on Zimbittle, one that had ended with a crush of an altogether different sort, that of her fist against his nose. Sometimes that was the prelude to a fuller courtship, but since her follow-up had been a sword to his gut, he had wisely chosen not to pursue the irritable troll maiden any farther. He could only hope his friend would fare better.
<br><br>
Taking the shaman's silence as encouragement, Numinaeth began to extol the many virtues of the object of his affections. "Her skin is the loveliest shade, kind of an imperial purple. Her eyes glare balefully, like a wild hellcat. She's mastered dual wield and can attack with two magical blades. And she has the most wicked and merciless laugh, sort of like a funeral dirge." And on and on in a similar vein. Purukivel let him drone away, in the meantime munching on some pickled dwarf while waiting for the dark elf to get to his inevitable point.
<br><br>
As the troll had predicted, Numinaeth concluded his catalogue of his beloved's merits with the resigned lament, "But she doesn't even know I exist." The shadow knight sorrowfully swilled down his mug of win and poured himself some more, chasing temporary oblivion. He was clearly surprised when Purukivel slapped him heartily on the back and announced, "Dis not be problem. Me helps you!" When Numinaeth recovered from the pain of a nearly dislocated shoulder, he could only stare in amazement at the grinning troll. Purukivel leaned in close. "It be okie. Me gots plan!" he whispered loudly. The dark elf blinked a few times in befuddlement, then gave his comrade's comments serious and drunken consideration. He had to admit that he was out of his league. Love amongst his kind was rare, since most unions were mandated by either the priests or the matriarchs, and so he had little idea of how to entice his prey. Puru seemed to be a troll of the world--maybe he really could help. He slammed down another slug of the thick, sickly-sweet wine, and came to a decision. "Let's do it!" he declared with a slur. The two tromped off determinedly.
<br><br>
Back at Purukivel's room, the troll rummaged through his pack and pulled out some bloodstained paper, a chipped inkpot, and some gnawed quills. Clutching these, he dropped gracelessly to the floor, his stubby legs thrust straight out in front of him. He looked over to Numinaeth, cautioning him, "Okie, you be quiet now, me writin'," and with that, he set to work.
<br><br>
The dark elf soon dozed off. Purukivel in the meanwhile labored away slowly, a frayed quill looking puny as his enormous hand clutched it tightly. Dipping the quill in ink, and coincidentally splattering said ink all over his hand, face, and the floor, he started to scratch out blocky letters on the tattered sheet held firmly in place with the stumpy fingers of his other hand. One eye squinted in concentration, and his tongue licked absently at his lips. His progress was fitful. At times he ground to a halt and stared at the ceiling with a frown, banging his staff against his head with loud wooden thunks. At others, he bent low over the paper and stabbed at it furiously with the makeshift pen, giggling as he wrote. "Dese be gud poetries," he mumbled proudly to himself. Whenever swept away in these throes of inspiration, he happily applauded his performance, cheering himself along. "Yay! Me be gud bard."
<br><br>
After a couple of hours, he brought his efforts to a close and awakened Numinaeth with a kick. The shadow knight grumbled and looked about blearily, then focused on the triumphant troll. Purukivel scrambled awkwardly to his feet and waved a wrinkled sheaf of papers about. "Okie, now we go see elf-gurl," he proclaimed, and headed for the door.
<br><br>
Numinaeth frowned. "Um...and then what?" he asked in confusion. The troll chortled. "Next part of plan, you see soon," he grated as he strolled out. The elf grimaced in uncertainty for a moment, then shook his head and followed helplessly. One could not easily stop a troll once he had set his mind on something.
<br><br>
After Numinaeth had taken the lead, a quick jog brought them into Neriak proper, and thence to an isolated two-story house constructed of expertly hewn marble. Heavy copper-faced doors and shutters reflected the pale wisp-lights with a ruddy glow, and a wide balcony projected out from the second floor. A garden of ornamental giant fungi sprawled out to one side in a subtle spread of dark reds and faded yellows and aged ivories. Lichen-covered pillars stood crumbling in the midst of the narrow mushroom stalks.
<br><br>
"This is the place," Numinaeth muttered nervously as he swayed unsteadily, somewhat the worse for drink. "So now what?"
<br><br>
Purukivel beamed at him, exposing an imposing array of sharp teeth. "Now dis part o' plan be cleverous. Me hide an' tells you da rhymeses, you tells 'em ta da elf-gurl. Den she git all loverly fer you!" The shaman capered in a flat-footed dance. "It gud strategy, me smart!"
<br><br>
The shadow knight scratched his head but was unable to find fault with this bold ploy. He swigged deeply from a skin of goblin brandy that he kept handy. Yes, this just might work! Slicking back his white hair and brushing some crumbs off his surcoat, he stepped forward, while behind him Purukivel crashed into the concealment of the fungus garden. The troll crouched behind one of the pillars, as well concealed as a bull elephant would be when standing behind a blueberry bush.
<br><br>
Numinaeth cleared his throat nervously and then called out. "Hail, Taluviam! It is I, Numinaeth. I would speak with you!" A few moments later, a figure emerged onto the balcony and looked down upon the shadow knight. Purukivel couldn't see her, since he had closed his eyes to remain better hidden, but his keen hearing warned him of her approach. Time to act! He growled out an instruction to his friend.
<br><br>
The dark elf gazed up worshipfully at Taluviam, so graceful, so beautiful, so delicious in every curve and line of her form, her face a perfect oval, her features exquisitely aloof and disdainful. He felt lost before such magnificence, at least until a loud cough from the troll prompted him to action. He listened to the words Purukivel hissed out and dutifully repeated them to his ladylove. "Um, me hab...er, I have a poem for you," he started, leaning back slightly to catch the shaman's next words. On the balcony, an expressionless Taluviam crossed her arms and waited.
<br><br>
Numinaeth nodded intently and then launched into the epic work of poetry, concentrating fiercely to clean up Purukivel's fractured syntax while striving to appear to be effortlessly and extemporaneously tossing off the lines all by himself.
<br><br>
"Oh, purty...um, pretty...elf-girl!
<br>
Your face does not make me wanna hurl.
<br>
Your body makes me--er, my--toes curl.
<br>
For you, I'd pay a pearl!"
<br><br>
Taluviam had no reaction to this lyrical outburst other than to narrow her eyes, surely a sign of approval, Numinaeth thought. He breathed out in relief, and leaned backwards, teetering dangerously to call out to the shaman. "It's working!" he hissed from the corner of his mouth. "Give me the next line!" He heard the troll giggle behind him, clapping excitedly. "Hee hee! Me be all matchmakerly! Me telled you dis plan be victorious!" The elf nodded impatiently, directing a fixed grin at Taluviam.
<br><br>
"Yes, yes," he called back. "It's great! Now give me the next bit!" And thus supplied, he forged onwards.
<br><br>
Each succeeding verse was quite like those in the opening stanza. Numinaeth noted how Taluviam's knuckles whitened on the balcony's railing, clearly a sign of her struggle to hold back her sheer excitement at his rendition. There was no doubt now that he had captured her attention at last.
<br><br>
Finally he swept towards the grand conclusion, in the stirring words penned by his friend.
<br><br>
"And your bosomage is so mighty,
<br>
That it makes my heart flighty.
<br>
So if it's all righty,
<br>
Can we make love all nighty?"
<br><br>
He dropped to his knees with a flourish, flinging his arms skyward dramatically and awaiting Taluviam's enthusiastic response.
<br><br>
From overhead he heard a scream of rage, and looked up in time to see Taluviam whip through two aerial somersaults before she hit the ground in front of him, a silver dagger drawn. She reached down, grabbed him by the collar, and slammed him up against a pillar near where Purukivel loomed a couple of yards away. With a blur of light, she swept the dagger forward, jamming it tight against the shadow knight's throat, its sharp edge drawing forth a trickle of blood. She glared at Numinaeth in fury.
<br><br>
"You know," she said in a controlled voice, "I've been courted by a good many men. Clever men, strong men, accomplished men. Ones that brought me silver and gems, some that promised me power, others that offered magic and mystery and wonder. But you..." She stared into his eyes. "You're the first to dare to insult me." Her gaze pierced right through him, and cold doubt and fear welled up within him.
<br><br>
And then she leaned forward, shifted her knife, and slowly ran her tongue along the trail of blood on his neck. Numinaeth's knees grew weak.
<br><br>
His beloved looked up again. "You're just how I like my men," she purred. "Drunk and stupid." Pressing up against him, her lips bloody, she laughed. "Kiss me, you fool."
<br><br>
And so he did.
<br><br>
And she led him away into her house, winking over her shoulder at Purukivel, who had cracked open on wary eye to watch the proceedings. He grinned back as the couple disappeared through the door.
<br><br>
The shaman stood up and cheered himself proudly. He knew that plan would work! It was not for nothing that he was known as one smart troll.
<br><br>
Chuckling happily, he ambled off into the darkness. "Womens," he muttered. "Dey always falls fer da poetries!" Then a new thought occurred to him. If it worked here, maybe it would work on Zimbittle back in Grobb!
<br><br>
He vanished into the depths of Neriak, humming tunelessly and trying to think of a word that rhymed with "wart".
