As beta approaches (cross your fingers) I find myself getting more and more excited
about the possibilities offered for role-playing and exploration in Everquest.  I
have wanted to play a Bard in an online game for ages, and now I’ll finally get my
chance.  With this in mind, I have gone back to my bookshelf and looked at everything
I have on what/who Bards were in history, and why the idea of being a Bard intrigues
me so much.  What were Bards in history?  How were they perceived in their society?
What was required of a Bard?  How was a Bard expected to behave?  In the course of my
studies I realized that there are many different ways to be a Bard, ranging from the
imposing seer and poet of Celtic culture to the traveling minstrels of Medieval
Europe.

Thrown into the mix are the varying ways that games have portrayed Bards,
such as Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, whose 1st edition Bards were along the lines
of a Celtic Bard, and whose 2nd edition Bards were more like wandering minstrels.
Celtic Bards fall closer to my ideal Bard, so I decided to split this article into 3
parts.
<br><br><b>
Part 1 - the Celtic Bard
<br><br>
Part 2 - The Bard as wandering<br>
minstrel/troubadour
<br><br>
Part 3 - Role-playing a Bard</b>

<b>The Celtic Bard</b>
<br><br>
The Celtic Bard was a seer, poet, musician, magistrate, and repository of culture.
He could travel anywhere, say anything, and perform when and where he pleased. He was
the bearer of news and the carrier of messages.   In addition, he carried the custom
of the country as memorized verses...he could be consulted in cases of Customary
(Common) Law. As a poet, he carried with him the magical power of satire, which could
raise blisters and disfigure the target.  As the rulers of Celts were supposed to be
unblemished, this power ensured good treatment by kings, since a ruler blemished by
a Bard’s satire would lose his rank.
