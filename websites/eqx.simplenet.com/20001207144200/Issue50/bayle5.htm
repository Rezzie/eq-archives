"Winter!" the shout rang through the forests, shaking leaves from the trees and startling birds from all over.  After pausing to hear an answer, the barbarian cupped his hands to his mouth and took a deep breath for another holler.
<br><br>
"Ahem," came a quiet voice from behind him.  Jalen let his breath out noisily and turned around.  A hulking figure close to seven feet tall, he towered over the smaller woman that stood before him.  She was clad in light robes over ornate leather armor, her hair the red of autumn leaves, her eyes the green of new spring grass.
<br><br>
"If you do not mind, could you cease the bellowing?  I thought a bear was wounded and in need of my assistance."  Her eyes sparkled with humor that belied her tone.
<br><br>
Jalen looked down sheepishly.  "Yes ma'am."
<br><br>
"Jalen!"  Winter came charging up, tucked her shoulder, and drove it into Jalen's midriff, doubling him over, knocking the wind out of him, and pushing him to the ground.  She then knelt upon his chest, grinning merrily down at her old friend.  "Did you come to rescue me?"  Seeming to notice the wood elf for the first time, she quickly nodded to her.  "Hiya Lagniappe," she mumbled, then turned attention to back to the barbarian.
<br><br>
"Umm..no, not exactly,"  Jalen muttered, trying to regain some of his composure and failing miserably.  Lagniappe smiled, shook her head, turned and headed back into the grove.
<br><br>
"Hiya chickie" muttered a voice behind Winter as she felt someone pinch her behind.  She growled and spun about, producing a dagger from somewhere beneath her armor, and crouched to face her attacker, still standing upon Jalen's chest.
<br><br>
"Still too slow, Runt" chuckled Kendrick, standing a few feet away and grinning.
<br><br>
Winter stepped gracefully from Jalen's chest, allowing him to finally regain his feet, and walked up to Kendrick.  Standing on her toes, she was eye to eye with him.  "Who are you calling runt, thief?"
<br><br>
Kendrick grinned again and glanced over at his barbarian companion.  "You let her take you down like that?  It's a shame." He tsk'ed.
<br><br>
"Umm...yeah, I let her take me down.  It makes her feel better," muttered Jalen, trying to straighten his armor and hide his blush.
<br><br>
Winter spun and faced Jalen, deliberately showing her back to Kendrick, as if daring him.  "What did you mean you're not here to rescue me?" she asked, glaring menacingly at the barbarian.
<br><br>
"What he means is we're here for the old man, not you, kid.  You seen him?"  Kendrick drew a dagger that looked remarkably like Winter's, and began picking at his nails nonchalantly.
<br><br>
Winter turned and snatched her dagger back and sheathed it.  "Hopefully, he fell off a cliff and is stuck somewhere.  I have no idea where he is and I don't really care."  Winter walked up to Jalen and whispered, "Did you at least bring some ale?  This elven wine is weaker than spring water and sweeter than candy.  It's kids' stuff."
<br><br>
Jalen grinned toothily, reached into his backpack, and pulled out a skin. Winter took it from him, opened it, and took a long draw upon it.  She then proceeded to go through a serious of facial contortions, similar to those seen on a torture victim, then sighed and shuddered.
<br><br>
"Ahhhh... that's some good stuff.  Halas?"  Winter re-capped the skin and set it over her shoulder for later.
<br><br>
Jalen smiled again and reached out and tussled Winter's hair.  "So how's captivity treating you?"
<br><br>
Winter swore under her breath and shook her head.  "It's awful here. Everything's so... quiet.  Everyone tip toes around, talking softly, like they're afraid of waking up the trees.  No one understands my need to run or to hunt, and everyone watches me.  They might as well leash me and lock me in a cage."  Winter swore some more, causing Jalen to blush again.
<br><br>
Kendrick smiled enigmatically.  "Don't worry, kid.  It'll get FAR worse before it's over."
<br><br>
Winter turned and regarded the half-elven rogue.  "What do you mean?  Did you find something out?"
<br><br>
Kendrick shook his head.  "Sorry, boss's ears only.  Besides, you're too young to understand."
<br><br>
Winter crossed the distance between them reaching for her dagger... only to find it gone.  She glared at Kendrick as he pulled it out of his jerkin and picked his teeth with it.  She snatched it back again, her eyes fierce, but Kendrick just returned her gaze evenly, smiling merrily.
<br><br>
Finally, Winter gave up and turned away, pausing to check for her dagger before stepping away from the thief.
<br><br>
"My, what a motley gathering."  Ozymandius strode across the platform towards the group, staff in one hand, backpack slung over his shoulder.  He walked up to Jalen and extended his arm in a barbarian greeting.  "Victory to you and your clans"
<br><br>
Jalen accepted the arm and returned the greeting.  "Strength to you and yours."
<br><br>
Ozymandius turned and smiled upon Winter, winking at her and was rewarded with her turning her back on him, crossing her arms, and gazing out into the woods.  As she did so, she spotted a familiar elven ranger leaning against a tree, sharpening an arrowhead.  He glanced up and smiled at her, then stepped back into the woods and vanished.  She swore, turned, and stalked off, leaving the group to talk.
<br><br>
The Erudite wizard watched her until she was out of sight, then turned and regarded Kendrick.  "Well?  You're alive, so either your boast was true or you never got in.  What do you have for me?"
<br><br>
Kendrick nodded and stepped forward.  "Price first, then information."
<br><br>
Ozymandius frowned, then made an offer.  Kendrick looked shocked and made a counter offer.  The wizard acted if such an offer was an offense to his very sensibility, and the haggling commenced in earnest.  Jalen watched in confused fascination, not understanding why it was so difficult to agree upon a price.  To him, one simply paid what it was worth, and the merchant sold it to you.  Jalen shook his head and listened to the passionate and occasionally injured discourse of the two men.
<br><br>
Finally, the two settled upon a price and Kendrick kneeled down to open his pack.  Reaching in, he pulled out a book and stood to hand it to Ozymandius. The wizard accepted the tome reverently, his fingers brushing across the runic sigils decorating the cover.  He then gently opened the cover and turned a couple of pages, his face lit in rapt fascination.
<br><br>
"An intact copy of the Scriptures of Innoruuk!  How?  Where?"  Ozymandius closed the book and held it to his chest, returning his gaze to the thief.
<br><br>
Kendrick muttered something about not haggling for enough money, then said  "I found it on Vashaar's table.  He sends it with his compliments."  The half-elf chuckled at his own joke, and Jalen burst out laughing.  Kendrick continued, "He's got ugly plans going on, and knows the Runt is here.  He plans to shake the shrubs and convince you he's everywhere at once in hopes of pulling you away from here.  Then he'll march on the city with the help of Mistmoore."  The last word was said quietly, as if he was afraid it might be heard by undesirable parties.
<br><br>
At the mention of Mistmoore, Ozymandius frowned.  "That is indeed bad news. Very bad news indeed.  If the Lord of Mistmoore can be convinced to join him, Vashaar may very well be able to tip the scales and raze Kelethin."  The wizard paced back and forth, clutching the book and deep in thought.
<br><br>
Jalen sat down on the platform, his mail clinking on the wooden deck. "Should we move Winter, then?  If it's too dangerous here, then we should move her.  Just the thought of the spawn of Mistmoore finding her turns my barbarian blood cold."  Jalen shuddered, then shook his head.
<br><br>
Ozymandius also shook his head.  "Where else can we take her?  All of Antonica crawls with Vashaar and his minions.  Faydwer is marginally safer, and in the bosom of Tunare is the safest place of all."
<br><br>
Jalen nodded mutely.  "I just don't want to see her hurt."
<br><br>
"None of us do, my friend.  None of us do."  The old wizard slid to the floor, tailor fashion, and cradled the book in his lap.
<br><br>
"Speaking of 'crawling with Vashaar's minions', what are we going to do about Qeynos?  There is no way Antonius can repel Varsoon and his goons, especially if Daedeloth is helping them."  Kendrick also sat down on the deck, his back against a tree.
<br><br>
"Well, there's nothing else to do but go there and help defend.  I know that's just what Vashaar wants me to do, but you're right... Antonius can not defend against an onslaught of that nature."  Ozymandius frowned and gazed down at the book in his lap, his fingertips tracing the sigils idly.  "Let us plan to head that way in a week or so.  It will take Vashaar's messenger that long to get there, and another week for Varsoon to pull together enough energy to summon an army.  That gives us two weeks to make sure things are prepared."
<br><br>
Kendrick began reciting the rest of the plans he had heard by rote and Ozymandius took out a quill and parchment and took notes, both oblivious to the eavesdropper nearby.
<br><br>
Winter had slipped behind a hut and crept back quietly to hear the talking, and now sat still and worried, biting her lip and concentrating to hear.  So focused on her listening, in fact, that she missed the person walking up behind her until he reached around, cupped her mouth with one mailed hand and secured her dagger with the other.
<br><br>
Winter froze for half a second, then drove her elbow as hard as she could, slamming it into a mailed chest.  Her assailant grunted but did not release his grip upon her.  Quietly, he whispered into her ear, "Eavesdropping is not polite."
<br><br>
Winter sighed in relief as she recognized the voice of her 'protector', Maclir.  She relaxed in his grip and he released her.  She quickly pulled away from him and turned to face him.  He smiled slightly, then slid down the platform a bit, gesturing for her to follow.  Having lost track of the conversation she was trying to listen to, she sighed and slid down behind him.
<br><br>
As they both lightly touched down upon the grass, he took off in a sprint.  Confused, she took off after him, quickly catching up to him.  Turning to face him, she saw the savage glee on his face at running and found herself feeling the same thing.  She quietly asked as they ran, "Where are we going?"
<br><br>
He turned and smiled at her, "Does it matter?"
<br><br>
She smiled fully then and tried to race ahead of him.  Still staying beneath the canopy of Kelethin, they sprinted to the edge of the city.  Slowing to a jog, then stopping at the spring that fed water to the tree city.  Maclir dropped to his knees, then sat near the water, gesturing for her to do the same.  He reached for a cup and scooped up some water, handing it to her to drink.  The cold water was exhilarating after the run.
<br><br>
"You looked like you needed that," the elven ranger said.
<br><br>
"I did, and thank you," Winter tried to hide her smile, not wanting to like her guardian, but finding herself doing so against her will.  "Sometimes I just want to run away.  This is all too much for me."
<br><br>
"I admit, the plots and schemes are far more complex than I could know or wish to know.  Give me the trees and the beasts and I am content.  I'll leave the planning to those that enjoy it."  Maclir grabbed another cup and drank of the water himself, then turned his rather disconcerting gaze upon Winter again.
<br><br>
Winter closed her eyes.  "I wish I could leave it to others.  But apparently Vashaar will not let me.  Ozy tells me that a lot is riding on me, but can or will not tell me what.  I feel like a pawn in their game -- I hate him sometimes."  She growled under her breath, slamming her fist into the turf in frustration.
<br><br>
"Odd as he is, he does feel he is protecting you.  I trust him as far as I can throw him, but I trust the Teir'dal less.  You are between the proverbial rock and a hard place and if there is anything I can do to help, you have but to ask."  Maclir continued to gaze evenly at Winter, his eyes never leaving her.
<br><br>
Winter nodded.  "I wish there were, but somehow I get the feeling that this will be something I face on my own."  Winter looked off into the woods again, not seeing the friendly forests she'd always loved, but a menacing darkness that waited to consume her.
