<em>Throughout the EQ community, I've seen a marked lack of enthusiasm for the Rogue class.  What do you think Rogues can do, in character, that will dispell the notion a Rogue is only a petty thief?
<br><br>
Oraelin</em>

<br><br>
Well, Oraelin, aren't they indeed petty thieves?  I can't exactly call a third level thief a master criminal.  It all goes to the concept of making your name through your deeds.
<br><br>
Essentially the rogue is like anyone else; You can only judge them by what they've actually done.  And even the world's greatest thief wasn't born stealing the Gem of Lokkar or lifting the Sword of Hope from the hip of a paladin.
<br><br>
Thief P.R. is generally bad because of the things you have to do in order to become a truly great thief.
<br><br>
Think of Conan (From the movie), and how gutsy breaking into the temple of the snake worshippers was.  That's the kind of thing I'd like to have be more possible.  I'm hoping that there are areas of the game that I've not yet encountered that allow for such sneakiness.
<br><br>
Ever read Fritz Leiber's Lankhamar stories?  Thieves are grimy, grungy, hide-in-the-mud-to-steal-your-purse kind of guys.  That's their greatness.
<br><br>
Which brings me to the next point:  What does it matter what people think of you?  I suppose if you are a paladin then you should be worried about your squeaky clean image being soiled.  But thieves have typically been the underdog all their lives.  To me that adds something to the character.
<br><br>
Now for a confession:  I've never played a thief beyond 2nd level.  But now that I've written this EXPRESSions article I suddenly have an urge to play one.
<br><br>
So look for… [Thinking]… Talryk (pronounced Tal-rick) on Bristlebane on the odd day.  And if you don't mind wallowing in the mud with me, perhaps we can find a seedy bar and toast to acquiring wealth.
