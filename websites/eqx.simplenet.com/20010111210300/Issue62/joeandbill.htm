My interpretation of role playing the first few levels of ANY character in
EQ:
<br><br>
"Scene: JOE the noble high elf Paladin and his companion BILL the high elf
Wizard are standing at the gates of Felwithe. They have long prepared for
this moment. They have honed their role playing skills. They have created
extensive histories. They are ready."
<br><br>
JOE: Hail fair Bill! I have awaited this time since I was a mere child and
we played together in fountains of Felwithe. Finally! To test our skills
against the evil denizens of Norrath.
<br><br>
BILL: Aye my friend Joe. I have studied many a long night perfecting my
spells. I feel the energy of my magic pulsing in my veins waiting to be
released through my hands. Shall we away?
<br><br>
JOE: Aye Bill, let us adventure, and let NONE stand in out path.
<br><br>
"At this point JOE and BILL move a short way away from the gate. Enter a
GIANT WASP DRONE."
<br><br>
GIANT WASP DRONE: Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
<br><br>
JOE: This insect's noisy ways are bothersome to me Joe, let us end its
simple life, and of course give thanks to our god for whatever bounty it may
provide.
<br><br>
BILL: Aye, Joe. This will be a poor test of our mighty skills, but a test
nonetheless. You engage the creature and I will strike it with my mysterious
magic.
<br><br>
"JOE swings at GIANT WASP DRONE. Melee ensues."
<br><br>
GIANT WASP DRONE: BzzzzbzzztBZZZZZZZZZZT!
<br><br>
"JOE is STUNG repeatedly, and is consistently missing with his swings. BILL
has casted twice on himself, and twice on JOE, and is very low on mana"
<br><br>
JOE: This is a fearsome creature Bill! Perhaps a demon of the forest
disguised as a simple wasp!
<br><br>
BILL: My magic is nearly taxed, Joe. I will...
<br><br>
GIANT WASP DRONE: BZZZZZZZZZZT!
<br><br>
JOE: Aiiiiiiiie! I am slain! Escape while you can precious BILL, let it not
be said I died anything but....
<br><br>
"JOE is STUNG to DEATH. BILL runs to guards."
<br><br>
"30 seconds later"
<br><br>
BILL: Joe, how unfortunate. I wept for your death.
<br><br>
JOE: SCREW this dude! I'm grouping with some POWERGAMERS!
<br><br>
JOE (in shout): Anyone wanna group with a lvl 1 pally...I'll make a good
tank!
