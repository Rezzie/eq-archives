<b>Halas -</b>
<br><br>
In the frozen wasteland that the barbarians call home, there seems to be a bit of trouble.  Many young barbarians have been terrified when wandering their playgrounds in the snow by instances of tremendous nests of spiders!

When asked to explain the sudden terrifying increase in the local spider poplulation, several druids just shrugged.  "None of us is all that thrilled about hanging out up there, it's just too darn cold.  And those barbarians aren't the most respectful of their wildlife.  And they don't like it when you try to explain to them that polar bears have rights too.  Mostly they just chase us off.  So we know very little about the wooly spider."
<br><br>
But when asked, Halas residence were confused by the attitude of the druids, and they are very interested in getting some help.
<br><br>
"Those stinkin' spiders be everywhere!  We crush them and they just keep comin'!  My wife... well, she's a bit hysterical at the best of times, but lately she's been insane!  She keeps thinkin' that dem spiders are gonna steal her children...  What, druids?  What's a druid?  If one of 'em can get rid of da spiders, we'll take two!"

Our duty here has lead us to try to discover a method for saving the residents of Halas from these creepy, furry little monsters.  Our diligent search lead us to the Oasis of Marr, where we located a piper of some renown.  He has been diligently saving the desert tarantulas from the local Orcs by leading them away from danger.  He says that he could spare the time to travel all the way to Halas, and will gladly do so if someone in Halas can cover his traveling expenses...
