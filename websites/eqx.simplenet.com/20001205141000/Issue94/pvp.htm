When the PvP teams servers were first opened, there was a lot of excitement, and nobody, including Verant, was prepared for the rush of excited players.  Now, the rush is over, and the servers have been up for a few weeks.
<br><br>
When Tallon Zek originally opened, I was one of the first 300 people to log onto the server.  Pretty soon, my Cleric was in a zone with 300 people.  I was amazed.  Lag was so bad, people couldn't open doors.  I even have screenshots of the player numbers in the Third Gate of Neriak.  Later, to the disappointment of a lot of players, the server was closed.
<br><br>
Verant opened two servers roughly 4 days later.  These servers averaged 2500, and were very popular.  Now they have tapered off to an average of about 1200 in peak times, and 900 in normal times.
<br><br>
At first, I was not impressed at all.  With 200 people crowded into a newbie zone, you had immense lag, and getting to the next level could take as much as 3 hours.  Level 1 players were grouping with each other.  But alas, some people gained, and it spread out.  And some people became disgusted, and haven't played since.
<br><br>
That is when it all became better.  Organized raids took place. Immediately, battle lines were drawn, alliances were made.  Currently, the humans, elves, and short races are all allied against the Dark hordes.  However, unconfirmed reports say that the Gnomes still give the Elves trouble on Faydwer, and that the Gnomes are showing a bit of a separation.  The political situation is tenuous, the alliances unstable.  Guilds have formed for training purposes.  Guilds have declared war on those of races other than their own.  And guess what...there are actually some roleplayers on this server.
<br><br>
Yes...there are.  I for one, believe that true roleplaying can only exist in a truly PvP environment, even more free than Rallos Zek.  However, there are those that will take advantage of this...and it's really not a viable option.  The teams idea, while scorned by most roleplayers, has turned into a great idea.  You do get your share of idiots, morons, and Kewl D00ds.  But my experiences have been notably more positive than negative.
<br><br>
I have attained level 14 as my Magician, Naria, and it is a great time. I can solo, or I can ask a guildmember to come and group with me.  I am currently smithing, as well as tailoring.  I've chosen a variety of useful skills that fit my needs, as well as those of my dark brethren, and our larger brothers and sisters.  My guild also runs some fine roleplaying quests, and I do not believe we are the only ones who do this.
<br><br>
Now, let's go over some rumors, or rules about PvP servers.
<br><br>
<em>Rumor</em>: I can train monsters on people of other races, and it's ok, since we're opposing each other.
<br><br>
<em>Fact</em>: No, you cannot.  I have spoken with a GM on Tallon Zek, and he has dispelled the theory completely.  Training results in loss of experience.  And loss of experience is in no way fun for anybody.  This is the primary reason for the rules against it.  And all indications from the staff on Tallon Zek are that pulling high level Guards into races KoS to them is also against the rules.  This is currently a problem, but people are being warned more frequently, as staff numbers on the Zek twins begin to rise.  And problem areas are patrolled.  Don't forget, warnings lead to suspension, and suspension leads to banning.
<br><br>
<em>Rumor</em>: I can sit at a corpse and kill the person as they come back to get their body.
<br><br>
<em>Fact</em>: This is partially true, and partially not.  I asked for direct clarification on this matter.  In very strategic areas, where a homeland could be protected, camping a corpse, in some cases is an acceptable, if not needed measure.  My personal experience with this was when I told people not to camp a Monk at the Nektulos entrance in East Commonlands. So they didn't touch her.  She dragged her corpse to the entrance, looted, and zoned in.  I followed, was killed by a high level Druid, and then corpse camped myself.  Truth here is that she could have been prevented to get her corpse, and it would have been ok.  She should have been blasted back to Innoruuk the moment she dragged it.  Corpse camping is defined as:
<br><br>
Direct camping and targetting of a player, with intent to harass.
<br><br>
Failure to yield, and allow a person to get their corpse, when you have been asked to do so.
<br><br>
The safest way on Tallon Zek to get a corpse is to shout to a zone, or put into an /ooc message that you are in the process of getting your corpse.  People will typically leave you alone, as it's a common courtesy observed.  Abuse it once though, and lie about getting a corpse, and don't expect anyone to believe you the next time you really DO need your corpse.
<br><br>
<em>Rumor</em>: Bind point camping isn't wrong.  If they don't like where they were bound, it's their own fault for getting bound there.
<br><br>
<em>Fact</em>: Totally wrong.  Bind point camping is treated harshly by staff.  To willingly sit at a bind point, and destroy someone likely 6-8 levels below you over and over and over, with no fear of reprisal is not only wrong, it's illegal.  In NPC cases, where Bind Points are in a KoS area, Guides and GM's will pull you out, and rebind you.  They will also kill the guards, or things that are trying to kill you.  And if you die while they pull you out, as is often the case, some Guides or GM's will offer resurrections.  If you are ever caught bind point camping, you need to seriously reconsider your priorities.
<br><br>
<em>Rumor</em>: Zone camping is illegal, and you can be banned.
<br><br>
<em>Fact</em>: No.  Zone camping is using the zone line to advantage, and usually, when a person comes out of a zone, they're half dead and rooted.  It is incredibly cheap.  But despite assertions to the contrary, it's not illegal.  This is something that does need to be fixed, however, word from the GM's on the chat server is that something to fix this, and some other issues regarding zone camping NPC's is already in the works.
<br><br>
Recently, with the last patch, some interesting features have been added.  And I am commenting now from a point of a spellcaster, with some very intriguing damage spells.
<br><br>
The major changes of recent value are:
<br><br>
If it's in a melee slot, range slot, or ammo slot, it cannot be looted. This makes Warriors VERY happy.  Now, their high level weapons are no longer lootable.  And they're not completely useless until the purchase or acquiring of a new one.
<br><br>
Spell damage in PvP is now at 60 percent what it was for NPC's.  Spells still have power.  But not as much.  This significantly closes the gap between melee and magic.  As a primary magic user, I would have been more satisfied with 70 percent, but that's me and my greed. =)
<br><br>
Spells cast on rooted PC's in PvP combat now have an attached 20 percent root break.  This destroys the root and kill method.  Roots can last as long as 2 to 3 minutes sometimes, and with spells, a lot of melee types were left completely helpless as someone blasted them with spells.  With the new root breaks in effect, you have a 1 in 5 chance of being able to get in close and personal.  As a Magician, I have no view, since we don't get root.  But I think this is another thing that's done right.
<br><br>
DoT spells now no longer cause you to lose experience.  THANK GOD!  This implementation is NOT perfect at all, but the fact that they have implemented this lowers the abuse rates significantly.  I am not completely certain, but I hope that this applies to player pets as well.  Another thing that definitely needs to be fixed is looting rights when a DoT or a pet kills a player.  The way it is currently fitted, pet and DoT kills go unlooted by the victor.  This can lead to headaches, and with the loss of experience being fixed and reversed, there is no need for the looting rights to be placed in effect.
<br><br>
There are many things that continue to amaze me about these servers.  If I had to rate on a percentage basis, I would rate the new teams servers a 95.  They are a fine addition, and I encourage all roleplayers to give it a try.  I know I love it, and am having a hard time getting back into the swing of a regular server. =)  Also, Verant has done a great job in recent patches of equalizing classes, and paying attention to what many players considered a largely ignored PvP community.
<br><br>
I recommend these servers highly, if you're ever around Neriak, stop in and say hi!  Unless you're one of those filthy light dwellers...grrrrr!  =)
