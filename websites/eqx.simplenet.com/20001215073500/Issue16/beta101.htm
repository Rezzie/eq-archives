As the EverQuest beta test gets closer with each passing day (we hope),
it is a good time to discuss what to do as a beta tester.  By the time
a software package has reached beta, it should reliably startup and be
executable from beginning to end.  It's what happens between there that
remains a mystery.  With any open ended game such as EverQuest, the
possibilities are, for all intents and purposes, infinite.
<br><br>
The job of a beta tester is to make sure that when the game is stamped
"complete" that it will be a fun experience for everyone.  This means
during beta testing we need to find all the potential things that cause
the game to not be fun.  This includes crashes, lockups, balance issues,
and more.

The typical adventurer will walk down the middle of the roads, open the
doors, and talk to their friends.  We know that much works.  However, given
thousands of people all in a free flowing game, you are likely to get
someone who is wacked out on drugs doing the stragest things you have ever
seen.  Odds are someone will do something that has never been tested before,
and who knows what the result will be.  So, the job of the beta tester is
to try everything, including doing things that only the craziest wacko would
do.
<br><br>
Here are some example areas that we can focus on.
<br><br>
Be CrAzY. Attack the furniture.  Talk to the monsters.  Pick up as many
little sticks and rocks as you can find and give them to the NPCs.  Climb
onto the roof of the livery stable.  If all you do is play normally, you
will miss the potential problem areas.  Think of doing something that no
else is doing.  The more problems we find, the more stable (and thus more
fun) the game will be.

Be stoopid.  There are an awful lot of morons out there.  But more
importantly, there are people who have never seen an RPG.  They may randomly
create a character.  So, try to be that Dark Elf Paladin.  Maybe an Ogre
Wizard has some advantages.  I'm sure there will be a lot of Elfen Rangers
and Ogre Warriors.. but try something unique.  It will also help determine
if the game is well balanced.
<br><br>
Be annoying.  Don't break any rules of etiquette as they are already
defined.  But if it doesn't say not to do it... DO IT.  Some little kid
is going to do it anyway, so it's better to point out the annoyance factor
as soon as possible so it can be prevented.  If Bard songs are monotonous,
play them everywhere you go.  Even if someone wants a quiet conversation.
Shout as often as you can.  Give worthless items to everyone you see.
When they drop them, give them to them again.  These are just some examples
of what annoying people might do.  Things like this need to be discovered
so rules or auto-ignore/refuse options can be added.
