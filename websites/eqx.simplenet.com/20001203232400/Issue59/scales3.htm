The caverns of Kaladim arch over the town like a dark, cozy embrace.  Elves and other outdoor races claim to feel enclosed, but the ceilings are so high they might as well be the limitless sky.  Firmly seated in the Butcherblock mountains, Kaladim is like the race it houses: strong, solid, and implacable.  I only wish that my race was a little less implacable when it came to dealing with other races.  Sometimes, I think, we are a bit too proud of our accomplishments, and too bitter about our reverses.

Our group had retired to the Pub Kal to celebrate, and had a raucous good time.  Fergus had left his house to me when he died, so we all went there afterwards to sleep it off.  Being used to the heady dwarven ale, I had awakened before everyone else, and was in Fergus' library, trying to see if I could find anything useful about the recent rise in the undead population of Butcherblock.
<br><br>
"G'morning, Oghma!  You're sure up early!  I mean, it's not really early, actually sort of late, but you were the first up, so that makes it early for me, right?  Isn't it funny how time sometimes means different things to different people, as if there were really several 'times' happening all at the same time?  I wonder if you have any books here on time, do you think you might?  I'd like to read them, to see if someone has used time magically that way, maybe I can find a new spell or two."
<br><br>
The bright chatter of Mundas filled the previously empty room.  For a small fellow, his gnomish enthusiasm filled a room with humor and intellectual curiosity.  I had a momentary spasm of guilt over my occasional grumping over his elliptical conversation.  He wasn't a bad sort, just occasionally disorganized.  Since I tend to be orderly-minded, it was hard to deal with him sometimes.
<br><br>
"Well, I may, have some 'time' books.  Right now I'm reading about some famous dwarven battles and where they were fought.  I'm going to plot them on that map on the table.  You could help if you want, and plot them as I read them off."
<br><br>
We spent a companionable hour or so, Mundas pestering me with questions, I firmly keeping us on course.  By the end of the hour, we had plotted out six areas where it was possible to disturb the spirits of the dead dwarven warriors.  One of the areas was where Laenilus had been attacked, and where we had fought the battle against the skeletal warriors.
<br><br>
By this time most of the party had arisen, and had gone into the kitchen to make some sort of breakfast.  When they had finished, they came into the library where we laid the map out on the table.
<br><br>
"Mundas and I plotted out areas of what I guess you could call intense spiritual feeling for dwarves.  These areas where important battles were hard fought and there was a sense of doom for the dwarven race if the outcome was against the dwarves."
<br><br>
"Right here where we met Laenilus there was a huge battle back in the days of King Turad, about 300 years ago.  The Crushbone orcs were led at that time by one of their greatest kings, a King Horsnahk, who had an incredibly cunning military mind."
<br><br>
"Crushbone has a stream running through it, which empties eventually into the Ocean north of Faydwer.  Horsnahk had his orcs build long, narrow troop boats to ride the streams out to the ocean. Horsnahk knew the military impact of surprise, and he and his troops rowed their way in darkness along the coast, and struck just north of the docks.  Back then the docks weren't walled, and it really didn't even have much of a dock.  Guards weren't even regularly posted there, but there was a ship expected later that morning from Freeport."
<br><br>
"One dwarf, riddled with arrows, made it to Kaladim to warn the city.  The twenty or so other dwarves were completely wiped out as the orcs established a camp and began ferrying troops in.  Most of the male population of Kaladim came to the call, and there was a mighty battle.   Once the dwarves showed up, scores of orcs, supported by spells cast by orc shamans, rushed into the dwarven ranks in an attempted to break the line and turn into the unprotected flank. Horsnahk knew that once a crease could be made in the dwarven army, the higher speed of the orcs could be used to advantage against the slower dwarves.  Luckily, as the orcs hit the front line, the priests of Brell protected them with mighty armor spells, and spells of strength.  Orcs were also magically rooted to the spot and unable to move, and it slowed down their onrushing companions.  Dwarf warriors and paladins, though outnumbered, were able to hold and eventually beat down the orcs.  The fact that the valley led almost right to the sea meant that the orcs couldn't get around the dwarves, they had to go through them."
<br><br>
"There's a whole epic written on the contribution of the Priests of Brell to the fight, as they were essential in keeping the outnumbered dwarven combatants alive and protected."
<br><br>
"I've sung that epic, Oghma!" said Squire.  "I sang it once in Felwithe to a whole roomful of elves!  They liked it so much that they rewarded me with food and stuff they threw on the stage!"
<br><br>
Archalania coughed.
<br><br>
"…As I was saying," I said, trying to keep my voice even,  "Had it not been for a dwarf gang of bandits who swam under the troop boats and knocked holes in the hulls, Butcherblock and Kaladim would be under the sway of the Crushbone King today. The orcs were slaughtered down to King Horsnahk"
<br><br>
"The battle took place mostly in that valley where we met Laenilus, which was swarming with undead."
<br><br>
"So, Oghma, that area, concentrated as it is with a spiritual feeling of racial pride and passion, is ripe to be disturbed in some way?" Laenilus asked.
<br><br>
"Yes.  We frequently hear jokes about an ancestor 'spinning in their grave' about a family slight, and that has a basis in religious theory.  Races, like Dwarves, who have a high level of ancestor worship are more likely than other races to have this effect actually create spiritual disturbances."
<br><br>
"It's like the best race to do that kind of thing, isn't it, since you mostly worship heroes of the past, right, like Kul and all those clan leaders?  Whoever is doing this is really very smart, and probably knows about a lot of magic stuff, maybe necromancy for sure, but a lot about history and everything!"  Mundas interjected."
<br><br>
Archanalia spoke from the floor, sitting cross-legged as he was to avoid scraping the ceiling with his head, "But how?  That's the important thing, isn't it?"
<br><br>
"Absolutely.  Once we know how it's being done, we can take some action to prevent it."
<br><br>

The orc emissary bowed before Meldrath, the only sign of his fear a brighter reddish tint to his eyes.  Meldrath smiled as he watched the Crushbone King's envoy work hard to avoid trembling.  Meldrath liked being feared.
	<br><br>
"So, have you brought what I requested?"
<br><br>
"O most dreaded Meldrath!  The Crushbone king sal-"
<br><br>
Meldrath allowed a spasm of irritation to cross his face.  The emissary froze.  He looked at Meldrath's face searchingly, as if to find which was the proper way to proceed, knowing full well that to guess wrong could be fatal.
<br><br>
"Yes, we have here the items you requested: The Crown of Horsnahk, the mace of the High Shaman Ooorg, and the banner of the Crushbone Elite Guard."
<br><br>
"You may go."
<br><br>
"But…"
<br><br>
"You may go."
<br><br>
The emissary, thankful that he had guessed right once, decided that one try was enough.
