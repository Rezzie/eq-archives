Oghma,
<br><br>
I just read your <a href="../Issue105/edito.htm">editorial</a> in Issue #105.  Well said!  I truly do not understand people who whine, bitch, complain, threaten, accuse, and generally make asses of themselves over this game, all the while paying $10 a month....
<br><br>
I am nothing but impressed with EQ.  Sure, there are parts of it that need work.  Yes, it is a hack-and-slash game.  Yes, there's nothing hard-coded to enforce roleplaying, but I don't think such a thing is possible other than taking ALL the combat out of the game.
<br><br>
But it is truly a beautiful, well-thought-out, stunning game.  I have been playing RPGs and CRPGs for 15 years.  This beats everything else hands down.  Fallout, Bard's Tale, Zork, Baldur's Gate, Diablo, Ultima, NOTHING even stands close.  I have NEVER spent this much time playing a game on the computer.  Is it the graphics?  The social aspect?  The exploration?  The sense of building a character?  Perhaps the mix of all of them?  I don't know.  I don't care.  =)  Instead of thinking about it, I'll just log in again.  =)
<br><br>
See you on the flip side.  =)

Dear EQX (and more specifically, Absor),
<br><br>
	Your analogy of the situation of item removal in EverQuest to
traditional paper-and-pencil roleplaying is both refreshing to see and
troubling to think about. Here's why:
<br><br>
	It's refreshing to see because it often seems that few people
venturing in the online world know what the roleplaying dynamic of P&P
RPing is. The cameraderie formed in a P&P group, the sense of adventure
and excitement about exploring the world...there are far too many people
running around their respective "Matrix" (whether that be UO, EQ, AC, or
what have you) treating it like a single-player game.
<br><br>
	On that note, that's why it's troubling. EQ is not a P&P game, nor
will it ever be, for one simple reason: instead of one GM (gamemaster) to
about 4-6 people, you have one GM for thousands of people. Even though
only one member of your anecdotal party will get the Sliced Bread sword,
your GM will probably compensate the others in different ways later on.
Your ranger may be accepted into the elite forester's school, or the other
warrior may find a diamond-studded shield, etc. In EQ no such sense of
fairness exists because there are too few empowered people to make it
exist. GMs in EQ must still pay for their accounts; they are not given
free time online for their service. EQ doesn't seem interested in
lessening the ratio of GM:player, either, so that there are more GM-run
quests and whatnot to give everyone a shot at "the wealth."
<br><br>
	The P&P dream is a good one, but it's one that EQ will never come
close to approximating.

Sorry Absor,
 <br><br>
I was just reading EQ Express today and thinking how sad it is to have all of you over there so dedicated to a dying game. I really hope you branch Express out to include more games on the horizon. I am what is known as a Phase 1 beta tester and you may have seen me post occasionally on the "beta board" (still running to this day), but I think the people at EQ Express are talented and its talent that shouldn't be wasted on Diablo 3D.  EQ is a game of largely untapped potential. It looked rather promising in beta and has been a complete and utter hackfest/itemcamp in final. With new games like Shadowbane and UO2 on the horizon it would be nice to see Express expand outwards into new realms. Don't bury your head in the sand about the state of EQ/Verant. There is a very good reason why most of the early beta testers have long since moved on...

Great site you have going here. I have a question. I do not get to play much
but would like to experience the higher levels without buying a character.
Do you know of any guides on powerleveling or powergaming. If not could you
either give me the author of "A Letter from a PowerGamer" Jeff Olmstead's
email address or give him mine so he could get incontact with me if he chose
to. I would really appreciate it. 
<br><br>

Thanks,
<br><br>

 <em>Well, this probably isn't the best place to ask for that sort of thing...  :P - Absor</em>
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
This is an addendum to my previous e-mail. <em>(Which the editor didn't include here, this one was long enough...  :P - Absor.)</em>
<br><br>
First, I'd like to apologise for venting my spleen to you. I love the
time and effort you spend every week on EverQuest Express. You
should not have to listen to me going on about how  bad some days
can get on EverQuest.
 <br><br>
I've been thinking about the situation that I am encountering. Initially
I decided that the best thing to do was simply to quit - to get out
before this sort of thing becomes too frustrating.
 <br><br>
However, quitting represents a fair amount of invested time and effort
that will be lost. Also I might be considered cowardly for turning tail
and seeking some other past-time. After all, one should only give up
on a lost cause.
 <br><br>
I don't know what I should do. The guides that I spoke with could do
nothing. I do know that as an enchanter, I have ways of really annoying
the hell out of selfish players. Unfortunately, this would be
considered player misconduct.
 <br><br>
What should I do? I've always tried to play a peaceful and considerate
character. I've always yielded spawn sites to lower level characters
and offered to help them whenever possible. My main goal whenever
I'm in a group, is to make sure everyone survives and has fun.
 <br><br>
Recently, as I leave the newbie levels, I find a change of attitude. The
attitude to power-levelling conflicts with what I try to do. It promotes
hoarding of camps and bitter name-calling.
 <br><br>
How frustrating is it? Your troll friend goes linkdead when passing
under the aviak guard tower. While you are trying to persuade the two
mid-twentieth level characters to leave, your troll friend comes back
and the aviak guard respawns on top of him. The aviak guard attacks
the troll and you help him kill it. It nearly kills the two of us while the
high level players stand and watch. You are then both accused of kill-
stealing and the 'good' characters now refuse to negotiate saying that
the troll stole the kill.
 <br><br>
I suppose that in the face of change, one must adapt or be destroyed.
As a dark elf, I can change to deal with this sort of conflict. In a sense,
my poor Ularyn will become the evil elf that everyone has labelled her.
 <br><br>
I've decided not to quit. Getting angry serves no purpose. Getting even
is my motive now.
 <br><br>
Thank you for listening to my rant. Please, keep this between you and
me.
 <br><br>

<em>This is the sort of thing that frustrates a lot of people.  I </em>could<em> go into a tremendously long rant about this, but I'll refrain.  There needs to be less crowding.  There are at least two ways to fix this.  One is Verant's to do, add more zones (Ruins of Kunark should help a lot).  The other is up to us.  Find somewhere else to hang out, and don't worry about leveling, just play and have fun.  There are places to hunt that are not crowded, find them... - Absor</em>

Re issue 105 editorial.
<br><br>
Howdy,
<br><br>
great magazine, ya'll do a stupendous job every week.
<br><br>
just wanted to say you made a good point and I agree with you. Coming from
LP MUDs, back before they saved equipment like Dikus, a totally static
environment worked there. The evil king Bob had his ultra-death weapon and
there was only one, whoever killed him first got it, everyone else got a
place holder item. This worked because nothing was saved, so next time the
MUD rebooted, Bob had his ultra-death weapon and anyone could get it. But I
don't think I could ever go back to having to logon naked and spend an hour
equipping myself... especially not on EQ ;)
<br><br>
It would have been nice if they had been changing drops from the start, but
it seems like it would be a tremendous effort to keep coming up with new
things that aren't just cookie cutter items (oh look a goblin skin mask on
that gnoll noble, and its stats are same as a snake skin mask). Not to
mention new graphics for the items.
<br><br>
I think that Shield of Hatred might be a good start if that Artefact tag
means 1 per server, but there needs to be a better mechanism for handing out
these quest events and determining who gets the reward. I mean why does X
deserve the Shiny Sword of Death for killing King Kong when there were 14
other people beating on it?
<br><br>
Anyhow, thank you for the wonderful newspaper and keep up the good work :)
<br><br>
