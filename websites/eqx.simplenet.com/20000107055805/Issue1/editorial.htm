<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the first issue of EverQuest Express.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to
take a little time to explain the aims and objectives of this newspaper over the coming
months and years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You might think that we at EQX are jumping the gun somewhat in releasing an
on-line paper at this point in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not wait until beta? you may
ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the reason we are not waiting until beta is that writing good
articles and publishing them in an interesting way is a skill that is acquired over
time.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we hit beta there will be a so many things to do, and so little time
to organize them all, so we plan to have an efficient staff used to working on a weekly
publication by that time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The format of EQX will change once beta starts, the newspaper will then be based
within the world of EverQuest.&nbsp;&nbsp;All news articles will then be written as if the
EQX newsroom existed within the world itself (who knows, perhaps we will manage to
purchase such a building).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We have a lot planned for EQX over the coming weeks, a new section is planned for
Issue 2, along with other features such as interviews conducted with well known EQ players
and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank-you for visiting our newspaper.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big><big>Staff Profile</big></big><br>
<br>
The following people have contributed to the first issue of EQX:<br>
<br>
<strong>Absor</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;Absor is way too busy playing Tanarus to
write up a biography (<em>Ed: Oh well excuse me for trying to interupt your game playing
for 10 seconds to write me a one sentence bio, jeez, you wrote a sentence just to tell me
you were too busy to write another sentence</em>).<br>
<br>
<strong>Arawn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>Ed: &nbsp;I didn't manage to get a bio of
Arawn in time for the launch of this issue, but he tells me that he is sometimes known as
a bit of a clown.<br>
</em><br>
<strong>Kit&nbsp;&nbsp;^..^</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;I formerly had an EQ humor
site on Fortunecity, but the page and it's contents of 'confidential' staff information
were mysteriously wiped from the server.<br>
<br>
<strong>Magi</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;I love basketball.&nbsp; I also like
computers and RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons.&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite part of every RPG is
the magic which you can tell from my articles to come.<br>
<br>
<strong>Starspyre</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;Starspyre the Kaseiryuu (<em>Ed: Does
that make you related to Markus Yu in some way?</em>) is a veteran games
player.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has played many OMGs, and has high hopes for next generation games
like EverQuest.&nbsp;&nbsp;He frequents many guilds to gain adventuring
companions.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would like to join him and his party when the game starts, <a
href="mailto:s_damien@hotmail.com">mailto:s_damien@hotmail.com</a> (<em>Ed: Hey cut that
out, what do you think this is, a dating agency?</em>).<br>
<br>
<br>
The current list of all EQX staff is as follows (displayed in first name alphabetical
order):<br>
<br>
<strong>Absor, Arawn, Dach, Foxtrot, Ian Ash, Jaga, John Chastain, Kit&nbsp;&nbsp;^..^,
