Hi Absor,
 <br><br>
I was reading through the Question and answer section, and someone requested a search engine to be able to search through your website. I am the webmaster for www.pacificcable.com. we have a search engine on our site. It is a free search engine that is really easy to implement. There is some advertising on the search engine page - that is why it is free. But it works great. You can find out more information about this at www.freefind.com. I hope this helps you out. If you have any questions please email me.
 <br><br>
Later, and keep up the good work!

<em>Thanks!  As you have probably noticed by now, we're giving it a try.  I'm still fiddling with it, so for now it will appear under the regular features section.  And we're sorry for the advertising.  As a rule, we don't do that sort of thing.  But, heck, what do you expect for free?

Hello.  I'm VERY interested in the A troll in Kelethin story by Ramos in issues 66 and 91.  If you could forward to the author my sincere appreciation for his work that would be great.

 <em>I contacted Ramos.  He said that he plans to finish the story, but he's very busy.  I'll send someone over there to hurry him along, in the nicest way possible, of course.

In support of Oxesiess:
<br><br>
  One fo the failings of EverQuest, and several RPG's, is the concept
of a common language.  Granted in our own history, there have been
trade languages and Latin was used for centuries by scholars.  But to
have every single person being able to communicate perfectly is too
trite.  In "Paper & Pencil" games, I would often confound the players
by providing NPC's who did not speak a language they had in common.
<br><br>
  So, in Norrath, to expect an uneducated member of an insular race (just 
ask any Erudite who has traveled to Halas!), especially one who is not to 
bright, to be able to speak fluent, grammatical Common is unrealistic.  
Wait, can I use that word in the context of EQ???
Oxesiess dialect of Common even feels right, if you've ever imagined the 
Barbarians as being almost Scandanavian.
<br><br>
  I don't expect people to throw in "thee"s and "thou"s.  I would expect the 
High Elves and Erudites to speak very precise Common, while
the Wood Elves a bit less so.  Halflings, and this is just my style, speak 
casual "lazy" Common.  Have not given much thought to Gnomes and Dwarves in 
this context, but realize their homes are far from any human settlement.  
Where would a young Ogre even learn Common when the guards kill most humans 
before they get into the city?
<br><br>
  To credit Mr Ellis, I agree that Auntie Moog gives better advice.
<br><br>
  Also, I was glad to see the link to the previous article and found it a 
pleasant read.  Would be quite amusing to see Oxesiess speaking with someone 
who had a very different accent/dialect.  Imagine the misunderstandings that 
would arise!

Hail all,
 <br><br>
first of all I want to let you know how much I appreciate the work you put into EQX, and reading it makes the game more fun for me in a way. I am always looking forward to the next issue. I especially enjoyed the tale "Nalixa's Journal" in issue 100, and now I am wondering whether it will be continued... hopefully soon &lt;tm&gt;! I loved the well done character development from a first person perspective, and the way it gave background on a place so many of us visited so often, maybe without noticing the fine details there. Please let me know whether any sequels to "Nalixa's Journal" are planned or in the works, and *when* I can read them. Thank you and keep up the good work!

<em>Hi ya's Morgaelin!
<br><br>
First of all thank you!  I am glad you enjoyed it.  Nalixa's Journal is actually the first "story" type piece I have ever tried to write.  Mostly, I would only do articles regarding games or an aspect of the game.  I admit I am a lazy writer, it's not hard to side track me into doing something else &lt;play EQ perhaps?&gt;.  But with her Journal...  it was the first piece of work I ever did that demanded attention to where I HAD to put it down. Even when driving into work I wanted to pull over the car and actually write what she was telling me she had been through.
<br><br>
Yes there is more, however the Holidays are throwing a real wrench into my free time.  I had hoped to have the second part done by this week's issue and as you can see, once again I have not been able to. I will though, swear upon my evil editors, &lt;put down the whip Oggy, please your dwarf is scary with that thing&gt; I will have it done for next week's issue.
<br><br>
If I fail in this....  I promise I won't kill you with Oxes for your Red Boots. &lt;eg&gt;
<br><br>

One thing that would really make an interesting addition to this (or to
EQ in general) would be if the religion you chose had an effect other
than just factions...for example:
<br><br>
Wouldn't it make sense for a Wizard who worships Solusek Ro to have
increased fire resistance and decreased cold resistance?  or slightly
lower casting time for fire based spells and higher mana costs for cold
based spells?
<br><br>
Why wouldn't a cleric of Tunare be better at healing then most other
clerics, while a cleric of Innoruk would have a better ability to smite
enemies?
