Inariis paced back and forth in her small, private meeting-chamber, her soft leather boots making hardly any sound at all on the thick, purple rug that covered the floor. An octagonal table stood by the far wall, but she had removed three chairs and put them together for the informal gathering. She looked at her two brothers. Aunrar sat in a high-backed chair to her right, his back straight and wearing an openly irritated expression; she had probably interrupted him in some experiment, which would make him stingy for quite a while. Well, he'd just have to adapt, wouldn't he? What was more important to the clan, his fumbling in magic or her twin sons' survival? In comparison Darllenan looked all too relaxed on his chair to her left, but she had long since learned not to judge a book by its cover. She knew his face and body well, probably better than anyone did, and now she could see the tell-tale signs of tension: small wrinkles by mouth, a sharper gleam than usual in his eyes and above all that far too contrived position. He was trying really hard to show a nonchalant appearance to her and Aunrar, but then, he usually showed his indifference to everyone, now though, his behaviour grated on Inariis already frayed nerves. She stopped pacing and stood before her own chair.
<br><br>
"I'm glad you could come here on such short notice. I know how precious your time is," Inariis said with a slight sarcastic tone, while she fixed her eyes on her brothers in turn. "You both saw what transpired earlier, when our oh-so-dear sister decided to come out of her shell and take a stand for a change. Not one of us had expected that from Vanriis and I would suppose we were all equally surprised. There's no point in dwelling more on that now, instead we should try to find a solution to our new problem. Although I promise that I will, as soon as opportunity arises, strangle the little goblin-spawn with her own entrails!" by that last sentence her temper had flared and her fury burned anew with a cold, white flame.
<br><br>
"Now for the problem at hand. I know that you both, for different reasons that I really don't care about, want my sons to survive almost as much as I do, but how will we go about it?" she said short and sharp tones. "I think it impossible by now that the location of their future education will change, so how will we protect them from afar? We all know that they'll be in mortal danger from that Faere scum and lunatic Angithrar. Do you have any suggestions? Aunrar? Darllenan?"
<br><br>
"Hmm, let's see," Aunrar said and steepled his fingers before him. "None of us can take an active part in their protection, due to the constraint of tradition. It will be difficult to sneak in some kind of artefact of any power, since only lesser cantrips and the like would get past the academy's protective barriers. The same barriers give them somewhat of a protection against hostile magic, but are in no way any guarantee. They are after all linked to the masters of the place and they have very likely taken measures to be able to circumvent the barriers. In other words the main threat would be pure physical violence, but we cannot leave magic out of the question. This sure is an interesting riddle to solve!" he exclaimed.
<br><br>
"This is no game!" Inariis snarled. "My sons are not one of your scientific experiments that could be allowed to misfire just to prove a point!"
<br><br>
Both Aunrar and Darllenan saw clearly that their sister was dangerously close to loosing control over her actions, but maybe it was understandable. If the twins were to succumb to an attack by the clan's enemies, it would be a strong personal blow to Inariis. It would probably be her biggest failure and setback in many decades and might just possibly leave her far too vulnerable for her own good. There was no place for weaklings in Neriak. They had a tendency to disappear, often in a very painful way.
<br><br>
"Trust me," Inariis continued, just a bit calmer. "Magic won't be a problem. Leave that part to me and I will take care of it in my way, but how will we handle more mundane threats to their life?"
<br><br>
Darllenan was thoughtful. "If we can't protect them by any of your arts, apparently it has to be by more physical methods. Hmmm," he furrowed his forehead and tapped the fingers of his left hand on the hilt of his sword. "Could we get them some kind of bodyguard? Might there be a way to get round tradition and the rules of the academy? Maybe if we got someone else enrolled too, someone that might keep a more than passing eye on the two of them."
<br><br>
"No," Inariis answered. "That won't work. The academy only accepts a very limited number of students and, as you well know, only really gifted or extremely rich ones. It might be done, of course, but it'd cut a far too large a portion out of our family's treasury and that would also mean trying to get past Ilithra and explain that enormous expenditure to her. That would not be an easy task for any of us and it would very likely cause enough commotion to raise questions among the rest of our siblings. And besides that, I have a hunch that she might not be all too friendly disposed towards me at the moment, a slight misunderstanding that could've happened to anyone." She sighed. "Are my sons already truly doomed?"
<br><br>
"Sister, I might have an idea," Aunrar said thoughtfully. "The barriers of the academy will stop us from equipping the twins with any items of true power, but how about several weak ones? If we give them several trinkets with overlapping fields of influence it might at least give them some kind of protection, maybe just enough to let them survive those first dangerous years."
<br><br>
 "Yes," Darllenan filled in. "It might not be exactly my field of expertise, but some charms to protect them from different hazards. One to protect them from poison, one against disease, several charms to ward off the many elemental forces and maybe some kind of enchantments to guard at least a bit against physical violence. I know that the last one would only grant a small respite, but it might be all they need to by some time."
<br><br>
"Hmm, you might be right dear brother," Inariis said. "Maybe that would be for the best. It would give them an edge against their and our enemies, but it wouldn't be so much as to make them drop their guard, too confident in their safety. They would still have to fight to survive. That would educate them in the true ways of the Teir'Dal and they would learn the real meaning of hate and revenge! Yes, I can see it now… my sons vanquishing their foes with fire and ice!"
<br><br>
Aunrar and Darllenan exchanged glances. Their sister was obviously much more unhinged than usual. For her to openly admit her quest for power and glory and one of the means by which she intended to get there was almost unprecedented. For their entire life she had kept her plans locked deep within her cold mind, seldom letting anything slip that she didn't want to. Now she was almost raving. Not even Darllenan, who had shared her bed on many occasions, had ever known her to loose control so openly. 
<br><br>
"Do you want me to create the talismans and charms?" Aunrar asked.
<br><br>
"No!" Inariis burst out. "I will do it myself. Only I have the power to create what is needed! Only I can protect my sons when need be!"
<br><br>
"Sister, calm down!" Darllenan said slowly with an icy calm. Somehow he had to try and bring her back from whatever place her mind raced at the moment. "It was you who called us here, remember? I'm sure you had a reason to do so and you know that we both want to help in any way we possibly can. At least they are my sons too."
<br><br>
"They are MY sons!" Inariis hissed and glared him.
<br><br>
"Yes, of course they are," he continued. "But even you can't look for every danger at once, can you? Not even the mighty Inariis is omniscient, even if it might be awfully close! Please, accept our help, after all, it can only increase Torllenan's and Xairiis's chances to live."
<br><br>
"Yes, sister," Aunrar picked up. "We can and we want to help. You know my arts and know that my studies have carried me to many places seldom visited by our people. It might be that I could find some part of the magical weave that will not be recognised for a threat by the barriers at the academy. I might even find something that not even the masters there would know for what it was! Maybe some obscure lore from one of my rare tomes could be used? Even you would have to admit that my library contains volumes that not many have ever laid their eyes on. Yes, now when I think on it, I might just remember a spell that ought to be useful: a small cantrip used by the surface dwellers to protect against both poison and disease. Come on now, let us help. Let us lend a hand in bringing clan Vandre'Tarl to even greater heights of power!"
<br><br>
Inariis looked sceptical, her body taught as a wire, but then she sagged down into her chair. She put her head into her hands and let her hair fall to cover her face as she bent forward. Her brothers watch her as she drew some deep and slow breaths, steadying herself. When she straightened up again, her features were set with their usual air of control and superiority.
<br><br>
"You have to excuse me," she said. Her voice calm and collected. "I have let my frustration over the problem with my sons get out of hand. It will not happen again, that much I vow. You are both correct in your assessment of the situation, the best way to do it, and possibly the only way, would be as you suggested. Let us see what kind of talismans we can create for the benefit of the twins and the clan. They have to be weak enough to be considered trivial and as such be passed over in any scrutiny at the academy, but they also have to be ingenious in their intricacy so that they will fulfil their objective impeccably."
<br><br>
Once again Aunrar and Darllenan exchanged glances. The change that their sister had gone through was nothing but remarkable. It made you doubt that she had really been as distraught as she had appeared just moments before. Had it all been an act on her behalf? An act put on to manipulate the two of them to further Inariis's own cause? They would in all eventuality never know. Inariis gave the impression that everyone else were just pawns in her private game with some unknown opponent. Would the queen explain her actions to her pawns? No, she wouldn't and neither would their sister. As one they saw the futility in trying to divine the motives of their sister. They would just have to do the best of the situation and try to come out on top at least and just maybe be successful in helping Torllenan and Xairiis survive for a little while longer.
<br><br>
"So, could you study your arcane works and see what you can find?" Inariis continued and turned to Aunrar. "Remember that we only have ten days before the academy will hold their official enrolment ceremony. Preferably we'll be done a couple of days before that so that we can test the functionality of our creations a bit. Can you do it?"
<br><br>
"Of course," he answered. "I'll create some kind of object enchanted with the ability to ward off poison and disease and I'll do my very best to have it finished in time for some tests. You can count on me to perform my part."
<br><br>
Turning to Darllenan Inariis said "Now, for the more mundane attacks. I know you have accumulated plenty of knick-knacks to protect a person from physical harm. Can you go over your belongings and see if anything you have might be useful? And as for a more important part, could you talk to the twins a bit and teach them the basics in avoiding danger, both from poison and a dagger in the dark? Ah, yes, make sure you give them the best armour possible that they can wear without drawing attention to themselves."
<br><br>
"I will see what can be done about it all and I'll make sure to drill them some more in the ways of our people. Somehow I'll force their attention away from their books for some time, if I so have to burn the tomes on their heads to do it!"
<br><br>
At this both Inariis and Aunrar cast him sour looks, but he only grinned. Sometimes it was so very easy to get to them. "Will you take care of the wards against magic and the elements then?" he asked his sister.
<br><br>
"Yes, you can leave that to me. I'm sure I will be able to concoct something that might work," she said with a smug smile. "Let us get to work! Return to your quarters and see what you can accomplish," and with that she stood and opened the door to her outer chambers.
<br><br>
Her brothers rose from their chair and went to the door without a word. Nodding their respects to her they passed through the door and through the next portal to the stairs outside. Inariis closed behind them with a small nudge from her mind, and then she grinned triumphantly. She knew that they both would do their best to find a solution for the protection of her sons and in the mean time she could concentrate on a few other things of importance. After all, she had already made certain that any form of hostile magic would meet with a very unpleasant surprise when threatening her sons. The affair moved along smoothly again, even after that traitorous snake of a sister had put a bump in her way. Well, she would deal with her in due time. There wasn't any rush. Revenge was a dish that should be savoured in the fullest!
<br><br>
With those thoughts topmost in her mind she entered her laboratory to start some new wheels turning. How she loved being a Teir'Dal! And few would say anything than that she more or less embodied their ideals.
