*Pop*.  That was your bubble bursting, because someone in that fantastic
world of yours just walked by and said, "Letz go dudez, I have to log + go to
th mall in 15 minnetes."  Not only did they say something that had NOTHING to
do with your fantasy world, but they didn't even say it RIGHT.  Let's imagine
that that was you, envisioning Norrath, being entrhalled by its otherworldly
feel, when Joe Schmoe walked along and ruined your vision of a more perfect
world.

So there goes the romance of the world.  Out the window.  No one's even
talking like they should.  People don't know how to spell.  It bursts your
bubble, because you were hoping for a truly immersing environment, and all
you found was some guy who wasn't roleplaying and couldn't even NOT roleplay
right.  You say to yourself, "Why did I even come here.  I thought it was
going to be cool, where I could be someone else, someone really cool who had
powers and skills, but all I've found is the real world all over again."  You
get discouraged with the game.

What I just described was actually my own idealogical hopes for Ultima Online
and the bursting of my own personal bubble.  To make a long ramble short, I
got pissed off because no one else was letting me enter the world I wanted to
enter.  Just by the mere act of typing in regular old everyday English, with
slang and whatever else you want thrown in, the people of Britannia ruined a
part of the game for me.  They brought me out of my "I'm not me, I'm really
so-and-so, a great warrior and mage!" mentality and slapped me right back in
real life, the very place I sought to avoid for a little while.
