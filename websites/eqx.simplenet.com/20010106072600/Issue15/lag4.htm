"Ok. Now I’m totally lost.  What does this all mean?"

All I’m saying is to truly evaluate your connection to a game server you have to look at more than just the ping time, but also be aware of the packet loss, and take into consideration your through put. For example is your modem 9600-baud?  Also keep in mind that not only does the game server have to reassemble datagrams, but your PC must do this as well.  If your computer is loaded down with background processes like ICQ, Real Audio, News Ticker, and Netscape Mail checker all going at once, not only are these taking up resource space, but they are also processing packets of their own! You could be the biggest cause of lag.

Also run trace routes through your ISP.  Check the amount of packet loss from you and your ISP. You can even check this information between your ISP’s ISP.  If the packet loss between these connections are greater than 3%, I would find a new Internet service provider.  In addition the average ping time between these should also be below 40ms.

I sometimes get frustrated when I hear someone say, "This game sucks!  I can’t deal with this freaken lag!" while not knowing what "lag" is, or  its source.

EverQuest has stated they are keeping the traffic minimal enough that even a 28.8 modem will be able to  handle, which means fewer packets for your computer to process as well.  A focus on coding an application around latency is a very good approach to client / server communication. 
So when you get you’re copy, and start playing EverQuest this spring [another evil grin],  and you happen to experience some periods of lag, remember back on this article, and check those hop counts and packet loss ratios.  Look to see what applications you’re running in the background.  Don’t just run around screaming,
"LaaAAAAAGGGGGGgggg" spamming my screen.

Son that’s another issue….
