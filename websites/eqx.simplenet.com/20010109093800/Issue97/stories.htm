I've begun my life as a scholar in the past few months spurred on by the activities of my beloved Ezmend.  A Tier'dal born into the current world can find waiting for him or her little in the way of assistance toward becoming a functioning member of the underground society.  There are no Tier'dal schools, only apprenticeships; Their helpfulness to the student varying widely with the skill of the teacher.  There are no epics to read and understand and model ones self after; Instead we have those sermons spoken aloud in church but which are not carried far.  Few Tier'dal faithfully attend church these days.  Me included.
<br><br>
I've discovered a number of things about the decline of Tier'dal society that I feel directly correlate to the ways in which we have conducted our internal business over the past few centuries.  I am, as I stated, only a fledgling scholar, but I will attempt to put into print what I feel are the failings of our society.
<br><br>
Please bear with me, as this is new to me.  Ezmend has spent much of his life pointing out the ills of dark elven culture, and will do so any time, any place, at any tavern in Neriak.  I, however, am new to being a rebel.  And it can be said that it is Ezmend's "bad" influence that brings these thoughts out.  Before we had met, I doubt I would ever have considered the way we do business, worship, and study.  He smiles when I say that, so I mention his heresy and he wears it proudly.
<br><br>
What we have lost, my fellow dwellers of the dark, is … The Epic.
<br><br>
One of the tools of teaching throughout the world is use of tale to show morals and actions by example.  I'm sure each of us has such a tale spring to mind when I merely use the word "tale".  The tales we have are the stuff of religious services.  This is the primary means by which these things are pushed out throughout our community.
<br><br>
My assistant is a bit of a rogue; I'll withhold his name for his own safety.  Whenever I need books he "acquires" them for a fee.  Just this evening he dropped off the latest shipment I had requested, and I paid him.  He mentioned he might need to raise the fee next time.  I made reference to the tale of <u>Socri and the Greedy trolls</u> and the youth looked at me with a puzzled expression.  Seems he never has set foot inside a temple of Innoruuk, although he professes to worship our lord of hate.
<br><br>
The ways that Tier'dal disseminate information are simple and oft practiced by other races throughout the world.  Some of it is in written form, much is word of mouth exchanged between belches at the local tavern.  But there is a problem with that sort of drunken tale telling.
<br><br>
We all know the tale of Lodrin, whose Halfling sausages were cause for his damnation by Brell.  And just as sure as we've all heard it, we each know at least two different endings to this tale.  Sometimes Brell grinds Lodrin into a sausage and plants him in the soil of Rivervale to promote soil health so the Halfies live through their famine.  Other times he simply picks up Lodrin and devours him whole.  One tale even has Brell ordering seconds, though this is a distinctly Tier'dal twist on the tale.
<br><br>
My point is that word of mouth changes the motives, means, and essentially the morals of tales.  The more they are repeated by uneducated folk who didn't fully understand the meaning of the tale to begin with, the more convoluted and preposterous they are.  Their meaning is lost.
<br><br>
There was at one time a cadre of tale tellers in Neriak.  They were royal assistants whose job it was to travel from community to township professing the victories of the King or Queen (Whoever was in power at that moment).  This propaganda eventually changed.  They realized that often those beyond our borders would not care much of news and so they sang the facts in tune and the first and only band of bardic Tier'dal were born.
<br><br>
For decades they traveled the world preaching the gossip of Tier'dal victory, and the dark elves learned history from the tongues of this band of wanderers.
<br><br>
So why then did they vanish?  Some time around two centuries ago a new king seized power.  His victories were few, his morals less known, and in fact the wandering minstrels had little to boast of for this man.  They took some of the old tales and adapted them to fit the new king, but the king was insulted.  His rage grew that the bards would need to fabricate victories.  And so King G'oernam created a crusade and marched on the Halfling armies who had settled into Kithicor.  So far from home and being such a poor general, the king's men suffered great losses.  The last act of the king, fearing that his losses would be professed to the world, was to order the execution of the bards and outlaw singing.  He told the masses that singing was a "pleasure" and therefore was in contrast to the ideals of Innoruuk.
<br><br>
This has been a widely accepted ideal for many decades.  In fact, the two psalms that were commissioned over five decades ago ("Lorus Intemptestia Nox" and "Sin of Joy") were first removed from the repertoire of the clergy, only to be put back decades after the death of the king.  They were never put back as songs, however.  Instead they were simple tales to be read aloud.
<br><br>
The loss of the epic tale has done much to denigrate our society.  We no longer have the intimate knowledge of Innoruuk that is afforded us by the repetitive singing of his legends.  Song does more than please the ears (as the king suggested), the melody creates a simpler means by which to recall those universal truths and those miraculous heights of our forefathers.
<br><br>
We have no centralized teaching here.  There are parts of the world, foreign cultures, where children are grouped together and told of history and given lessons in math and writing.  We have left this up to parents and mentors, but the degree to which children succeed at these things then becomes highly subjective, as there is no standard for them reach.
<br><br>
I've spoken with a number of folk who tell me that to change Tier'dal society is to send an open invitation to be harmed.  We are a people at war with the invading cultures of others; We've even got a foreign quarter wherein all manner of folk congregate, much to the dismay of some of the more vocal factions who speak of Tier'dal sovereignty and purity.  But one thing that I didn't realize was how little of our existing structure actually works.  We are letting our children down by not doing our best to teach them the errors and triumphs of history.
<br><br>
As much as the church professes to push us forward, they might indeed lose some of their sanctity.  That is, they currently are the only sanctioned tellers of tales.  When I spoke of reintroducing music to the darkened halls of Neriak, I was met with a number of responses from the clergy.  Only one among them seemed to truly ponder the idea.  Another spoke a curse at me for daring to instill joy in the masses when the only joy they should feel is from the hate they bring to others.  And several others simply saw their stature as being threatened, perhaps rivaled, by bards.
<br><br>
Would that I were capable of singing and composing.  Perhaps there are those among us who hold some ability in that area and who might resurrect the "Bardic Ideal" for the betterment of our race.  That is the only motive I have here; To suggest that our growth is stunted by a lack of communication and a dearth of learning.  It is ironic that our greatest glories were in our past, before the abandonment of song, and that without song many of us will never know that.
