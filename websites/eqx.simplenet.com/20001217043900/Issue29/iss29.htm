The rain fell in arrow straight curtains, caught in suspension by the
lanterns light, a dreamy, mystical sight, or so it had always seemed to
Fale. Pulling his red woolen scarf over his mouth and nose, sparing only
the briefest of glances at the buildings that towered over the narrow,
cobbled streets of Freeport. Weather aside, Fale had always found this
particular city to be a remarkably ugly one. Though its shadowy alleys
and darkened niches always made for good business in his particular
craft, he was always stricken by the uniform boredom with which
everything seemed to be constructed...

I've written this down to see if I can make better sense of it all.  It seems to an ordinary observer that I am either a deranged lunatic, one who has spent his life in a drugged hallucinatory state, or a man motivated to create a fiction of his own life.  I assure you that the accounts that follow are accounts of strange things that have happened to me.  I try to leave my speculations out of these pages and keep to the story and what I felt at the time it happened, but I am only human, and therefore prone to hindsight and a need to place order on a chaotic universe.

<center><big><b>Developing a Persona</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
As a preface, this "activity" is recommended for the seriously bored role player, as well as those that would like to develop an interesting role. I really wish Ayrent was around to help with this article, since his old article on this same basic subject really would make a great preface to this. The point is to help draw a better picture of your characters persona. I warn you, this is silly, illogical and downright fun.

My name is Erlynar and I have lived alone in this log-walled cabin in Toxxulia Forrest for over one hundred years. In all that time I have not seen another of my kind, nor they me for I have concealed myself and this hidden glade with powerful spells of warding. As I near the end of my too long life I have decided to do what I swore I would not and that is to lay down in this book the tragic story of my doomed existence. I do this as a warning to all those who fancy themselves scholars of the arcane and whose goals include the mastering of deep magics and forbidden knowledge; a warning for all those like my younger self who think they are the masters of the planes of power.

Seeth walked along the garden's path; the vast array of flowers and plants created an environment unlike any other. He always came here to think whenever things got too hectic. He sat down on a wooden bench and began to review his speech. No matter how many times he rewrote and edited, he still wasn't happy.

Nigel, wearing a robe with hood that covered his face, entered the city of Qeynos.  He walked in a manor he thought wouldn't draw attention towards himself.  The castle was at the northern top most end of the city, and quite a long walk from the gates.  The street was lined with merchants on either side.  They sold everything from food to weapons to jewelry.  Several of the merchants called out to Nigel.

<center><big><b>My Forth of July Vacation</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
My wife had planned out a wonderful vacation over the Fourth of July weekend.  She decided to take me to a town in Pennsylvania where her father had grown up, a town where no one has any secrets and everyone knows everyone.  This was a town in which no household has an air-conditioner, no Worlds Gym to workout in for a week.   This is a place where everyone in the town gets together on Friday night and gathers at the American Legion to play bingo and other card games.   I mean EVERYONE goes.  It was like being trapped in a bad episode of The Andy Griffith Show.  I found myself whistling that tune several times during the trip.
