Russell did a <a href="../Issue59/definition.htm">sum up</a> on what roleplaying was.  Now let's look at why it's so impossible to do, or why more gaming companies don't try to honestly achieve it.
<br><br>
<b>Money</b>
<br><br>
If I can quote one game, I can quote them all.  They are out for money and the developer is out to see his dream.  The developer's dream discussion another time.  But let's really look at the market and it's history.
<br><br>
Players usually fall into four groups: 1) the roleplayer 2) the power gamer 3) the shooter 4) the d00d.
<br><br>
The power gamer will continue playing your game as long as viable goals exist.  I cannot stress viable enough.  For the true power gamer, everything is risk vs. reward, time vs. gain.  With the true power gamer looking for anything in game to exploit and advance themselves at no risk or less risk, the game soon becomes a game of "maxing out."  The company either has to start releasing new, more challenging areas tailored to that sort of player, or have their clientele whine about why their crit sucks, how much they will die, and complaints about how some classes are inferior and why nobody should play them.  The current market of the played product has to keep constant redevelopment of new areas to maintain income from the power gamer.  Plot elements such as a quest to understand *why* you're killing a dragon are wasted material and development time.  They don't care why - they just want to know their skill gain for wearing the nifty new item, and that will show itself from three hours of extensive testing in various areas.
<br><br>
Shooters are big money.  The target market for these games is youths.  "Mom LOOK! Way COOL!"  Kids usually go for the neatest graphics and biggest gibs (gory destruction of opponents).  Mortal Kombat taught that to the gaming industry more than Diablo and Warcraft combined.  But the industry also has to think about what they are catering TO.  What separates one shooter from another?  Graphics and game play.  Now, how hard is that to top?  It's not, as proven year after year.  Shooters are only interested until the next coolest, neato shooter is released, and then the previous game can kiss off most of the previous monthly revenue.
<br><br>
The d00dz range from any age group, and are focused on just causing someone else grief in a fake world.  Why would anyone display feelings that the d00d are looking for?  Because, the Internet grows, there are many not acquainted with the customs of it.  These people prey on that.  They enjoy mass mutilation with no skill involved, will cheat to accomplish it, and repeat how godlike they are after their "achievement".  They will use words or statements that would, in the real world, have them arrested for harassment or beaten to a bloody pulp for speaking to someone's mother in such a way, and they get away with it.  Why is the RW standard of legal public treatment or courtesy reduced on the Internet?  Because people can't see each other, and therefore the abuser is safe, and the abusee shouldn't feel so bad about typed words?  When was the last time anyone reading this got typed words from the IRS and didn't feel bad about it, unless it was a return?  Yet no one really tries to check this behavior.  Walk into almost any restaurant, start speaking in the manner of "Your mom did XXX to me and my dog last night and she enjoyed it" and if you're lucky, management will throw you out.  If not, ten men standing up and giving you a good piece of their minds or fists will have about the same effect.
<br><br>
Yet this behavior goes unchecked on the Internet, and some protest it being discouraged as "interfering with a person's playing style". Let's look at the word "style".  Then let's ask developers if they simply want a mass abusing market, and the sheep to feed them with or not.
<br><br>
The roleplayer is the most constant market, and the hardest to please.  Why?  Because they WILL (as has been proven) pay hourly rates to protect their environment.  They WILL call any developer on threatening that environment or not protecting it.  They are, on a whole, the most vocal well-spoken crowd out of any Internet group.  However, for some reason there doesn't seem to be an effort to appease them.  Despite that they have proven in the past that they will match any games demands either box, hourly rate, monthly, or box and monthly rates.  Why?  Because in a lot of cases they are looked at as the sheep to supply the shooter and d00d with.
<br><br>
Perfect game balance.  Power gamers REQUIRE it.  Most on-line multiplayer games revolve around not being able to completely conquer by your self.  But if there isn't perfect balance between the different classes, required to achieve next goal, then your game is going to be shredded on mechanics until the end of time.  They will also make sure that any new joiners know that all the classes are unbalanced, and if they want to succeeded they need to be X class.  Result, a game FULL of X class with little variety.
<br><br>
<b>Fame</b>
<br><br>
I, Onnie (no I call myself by my real name), maintain that RPers are the most constant money making market to subscribe to.  Not only do I maintain this belief, but that the FIRST on-line game that makes a TRUE RPG will not only become the next J.R.R. Tolkien of all on-line games, but will force other on-line RPG's to match it, or BEAT it. That causes the whole RPG's previous history to come under scrutiny.  Was it REALLY an RPG, or just an adventure game?  Imagine trying to lure away a whole entire COMMUNITY from a game!  How do you do it? Graphics?  Graphics are not as relevant, because the picture of the gnoll doesn't dictate the players' reaction to the gnoll.  Depth?  They already HAVE a living history.  Game play?  Is your computer more intelligent than this one and if so, why should I go talk to a computer?  A full captive audience, based on EACH OTHER, using your game for props and enforcement not to disrupt the environment with those that want to have nothing to do with interaction on a human level with other players.
<br><br>
<b>Depth</b>
<br><br>
To date, I have yet to hear any player say a game has too much depth. But what is it exactly that players mean when they scream depth?
<br><br>
Interaction with the world.  This isn't merely walking around talking to NPCs, finding out they need to go kill the clan chief of the Doggie Woof-Woof tribe.  Players are asking for *reactions* from their interaction with the environment.  MRPG have a hard time tailoring a game for thousands of users that make them feel individual, or at least that is what they always say when players yell they want more depth.  In actuality, the players aren't asking for constant individual attention, but for rare circumstances that will change the environment around them if they succeed in a quest or hunt alike.  For example, maybe 3 or 4 quests that can somehow alter the world around them or at least have an impact on it that's noticeable.  A good example would be a one-time quest against an evil underworld lord.  Once he's dead, he's dead.  A backlash would follow that, perhaps underworld monsters become tougher to fight because they are ticked or perhaps weaker because he's not there to lead them.  The upside to it all is, it's fully within the developer's control on what the players do to the world.  Balance and counter balance from the players feeling they do have decisions that can effect themselves as well as others is never out of control and still leaves the players with the feeling that they have actually done SOMETHING vs. something everyone does.
<br><br>
Player and Developer Interaction.  Anyone who has play any on-line game for a length of time knows, developers never seem to sleep.  Their interaction is an integral part of any on-line game.  They bring the magic into a world that would otherwise be full of chit chat and killing.  There's usually only one unfortunately, and everyone wants to have his ear.  Having a council with the players once a month and full within game context is a great way to solve this.  The Troll King suddenly steps out of this throne room and starts walking into the local butcher shop, pretty soon everyone knows the Troll King is having a meeting regarding how his subjects are doing.  It can be race or class based, speaking to a different group each month.
<br><br>
Deities.  This can get players more excited than almost anything else.  There's a *real* person in charge talking to them.  Quests to go on, possible lead in to an event that might affect the world, or just a chat to see where their subject is at in the game.  It's the stuff that makes rumors spread throughout the land.  Analysis of every last word to see if there was a deeper meaning in the conversation.  In other words, it breaks the daily routine.
<br><br>
<b>The Roleplaying Environment</b>
<br><br>
This is probably the single most daunting aspect that has kept gaming companies from releasing a true RPG.  The initial effort to create the environment is time-consuming.  Afterwards it's general maintenance of interaction.  What exactly is general maintenance?
<br><br>
Clientele.  There are a few ways to approach targeting the game. Segregation and taking in the whole market.  Screening to try to ensure the type of players you're putting together.  Company policy on player behavior.  A company would be silly to not try at take the whole market?  Right?  Well for how long is it possible to hold all the market?  Shooters will probably be gone soon, since MRPGs almost can't compete with the fast turn out of multi-player online first-person shooter games.  D00d's will be around as long as there are players for them to prey on.  Powergamers are a harder to tell with.  Many factors go into their addictions, which I won't go into now (that's another long letter).  RPers will stay so long as they have interaction and a community that's worth being in.  Despite the latest turn out on the market, they have built up a history and will pretty much only leave when the environment goes to heck or everyone else leaves.  Getting ALL of them to up root is a major feat, and usually communities only do when a game has been bought out and is being shut down for better eye candy.  Is it so hard for a company to take a stance against abusive treatment of players verbally and actually mean it?  I honestly don't think so, if you take the three strikes, you're out approach, and have a report function which gives people ample warning, and make sure players know what to expect for their bad behavior.  On-line games are a club, not a right, and membership should be treated as such.  Stress to the players that this is a game designed to allow them to try to behave as an evil character would.  Have player volunteers help new people with the basics in RPing to get a feel for it.  Provide a document outlining what to expect in game from other players, and that others actions will be largely placed on their class and race.  Provide separate areas for the new roleplayers, to allow them to gain experience in roleplaying under the guidance of more experienced RPers.  Let the newcomers integrate with the advanced as they gain roleplaying experience and confidence.
<br><br>
Killing of other players is also at of the crux of it, IMO.  How do you control how much players kill each other to where it's not abuse?  There was several ways to approach it.  Limiting the number of kills.  Major penalties for killing what the AI would recognize as a "friendly" to you character, such as a Paladin of Rodcet Nife killing a good cleric of Rodcet Nife.  Almost anyway yuo slice it, it seems static to try to control.  However, most roleplayers don't mind death, so long as a ROLE is being PLAYED.  It comes back again to clientele.  Another problem would occur with 100 players and 50 or them want to be assassins.  How do you make the assassin special?  Make it hard to be one.  Impose on the true master of killing all the things that SHOULD go with that life style.  To the nonserious it will be a pain and seen as penalties for just being "me".  To the serious it will be an extra added thrill and challenge. Who wants a master killing group living in a guild right down the street in a fancy guild house?  They should be underground, dealing with fencers if they are that widely known, and the fencers should be few and far between.  In other words, a shady life style that goes with the territory.
<br><br>
The Daily Environment.  Contrary to popular belief, "thee" and "thou" is not required to roleplay, nor is it required to be considered roleplaying a paladin correctly *snickers*.  I myself am fond of dialects and will make one up to fit a character that might have a different accent from the norm due to background.  But it's not a must, it's something that I do, or others, for more character definition and to portray in sound a meaning that would otherwise be lost.  However, there's a big difference between trying to portray an accent with typed speech and sheer silliness such as \/\/3 \/\/|L1 |<|11 U 1f \/\/3 <@n.  Trying to understand a new dialect that's an attempt to make words sound a certain way is interesting and lends a unique air about characters, IMO, but the above example is not trying to impose any sort of accent at all.  In fact, thanks to TwoHead for writing it, and I hope someone will tell me what it says.  Just the company stressing, or having a three strikes, you're out policy for the completely screaming and blatant out of context for the environment will stamp out such behavior quickly and strengthen the roleplaying environment.  This is not to say that there can't be some out of game discussion, though I don't think of someone saying "Explain" about the game as out of context anymore than me saying to TwoHead "Explain" what that d00d-speak makes me any less than Onnie.  It's the shouted to the whole area "Man I had such a rough day at school and my girlfriend went psycho on me, and got a knife, but we ended up in the bedroom" stuff that really has no place.  There are many *free* services for chat, messages, or hearing each other's voice that I feel these conversations should be taken to.  A courtesy to others that they just might not want to hear about your rough deal with the IRS, having just had one themselves and were just starting to relax away from it all, until you spoke.
<br><br>
I feel strongly that an RPG can be achieved.  The only reason it hasn't been is a touch of intimidation from listening to players.  Of course when you talk to players about what they want, they will say the moon and hope they get off the earth.  But that doesn't mean even getting into space isn't viable, not worth the effort, or won't make money.  If such things weren't viable, or didn't make money, then the first computer taking up large building would have been a failure from the start.  Some people today can still out-calculate computers on an abacus, but what does most everyone use?
<br><br>
Paper and pencil games are on the way out for good IMO.  In a computer game, everyone SEES the castle instead of trying to imagine it from a DM's words.  Some might say seeing limits the experienced roleplayer.  I disagree, the experienced roleplayer cannot be limited in imagination, and the inexperienced has just been give a tremendous tool to interact with, helping to clarify what wouldn't otherwise be that clear.  Pretty pictures, props such as deities, all crisp, clean, and concise; they say it's a RPG, but somehow can't say what an RPG is.  How can you make, market, and say your having the best environment possible for one, when you don't know how to say what roleplaying is?

Thanks to Valkar, my Chief Editor
<br><br>
I MUST thank Valkar for editing what has to be the worst person to try to.  When I get off into rants, I throw all my idea's out regardless if in order so I don't lose any content.  Without him most of my long pieces would be nothing but jumbled phrases.  EQ Avault NG doesn't pay him near enough!... now... about a raise for him...
