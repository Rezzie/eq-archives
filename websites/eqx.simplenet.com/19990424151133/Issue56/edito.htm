	When I read about the PK situation in UO and the complaints of role-players and those who want to be able to enjoy the game without fear of rampant killing, I also remember that those who are true PvP warriors are not those who run around killing newbies, they are the mighty bunch who relish a challenge only provided by defeating a human opponent.  Running around <a href=http://www.pk-hq.com/> PK-HQ</a>, I found there are varying levels of feeling on that, ranging from a "survival of the fittest take no prisoners and kill anyone around you" mindset to hard core Role-playing PK's.
<br><br>
	EverQuest's approach to the PvP switch has been talked to death, so I don't really want to explore all the arguments for or against it, but I want to make an observation that recently struck me.
<br><br>
	EverQuest's version of the PvP switch is perfect for the PK warriors.
<br><br>
	Currently in EQ, you can turn on your PvP switch (which is irrevocable) and go after others who have their switch on also.  If you want to, you can even NOT be PvP and still challenge other players to duels.  This makes it possible to challenge other players even if you are not PvP, and enjoy the challenge of fighting a real live being.
<br><br>
	Even if you are both PvP, two things DON'T happen.  You DON'T get exp, and you DON'T get all the equipment the player had.  You are allowed to pick one item from the fallen corpse of your foe, but that's it.
<br><br>
	The fastest route to power and wealth in UO was killing other, weaker players, getting the skill increases for the fight and the treasure they carried and going on to the next player.  The challenge aspect was merely icing on the cake, the true reward lying in the rapid advancement possible by killing other players.
<br><br>
	EverQuest's switch is the perfect foil for those players who would lie in wait Christmas Eve with a sniper rifle, knowing that Santa has the highest loot/risk ratio of any MOB.
<br><br>
	When I played on PvP MUDs, I was mostly a warrior type as above, I really was pretty careful not to fight anyone who was more than 2 levels below me.  There were the occasional exceptions, players who were so annoying that I killed them down a few levels as an object lesson.  I usually returned their equipment to them, and we usually parted as friends.  Sometimes their revenge was brutal when they caught back up :).  What PvP <b>wasn't</b> on that MUD was a kill and loot-fest, which was probably due to the environment and the community.  That is what I think we are headed towards in EverQuest, but without 989 depending on a PvP community to get bad, game destroying habits.
<br><br>
	I think that 989 is looking out for those PvP players who want to excel in PvP, and not helping those who give PvP a bad name.  They have taken the combined experiences of their development team, added in comments from both role-players and PvP players, and made what I think is the best workable solution.
