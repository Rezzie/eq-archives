Ever wanted to role-play, but do not know where to start? Hang out with role players often but don't know how to fit in? This can be a challenge sometimes in your day to day in Norrath, even if you do frequently play with other role players. My friends had encouraged me to role-play more, as they said I should be able to after writing so many fictional stories for my EverQuest characters. Well I can attest that bringing a role into Norrath isn't always as easy as it seems.
	<br><br>
One of the most inescapable truths in the game seems to be that role-playing and level advancement are counter-productive goals. The number of role players that seem to be trapped in the lower 15 level range by their play style has reached comic proportions, so much that this phenomenon has shown up in parodies and jokes about EverQuest elsewhere. Well, it is true, moving from monster camp to the next inhibits most talk at all beyond "rdy" and "oom". Thankfully I have found there is more to playing EQ than this. Here is an example of one way I found a common ground to start role playing with other players in a manner that is easy for everyone involved to participate.
	<br><br>
Recently I started a new Paladin character in Qeynos, follower of Karana in the Temple of Thunder. These Paladins and Clerics get one of the cooler starting quests, one to collect donations from various NPCs in the greater Qeynos region. This is an exceptionally great quest for getting to know the different quests in the region, as I found myself "hailing" everyone, and then asking each of them over and over about donations. I received many colorful responses, starting information about other quests those NPCs might offer and spent many hours on this quest before I even got close to finished with it, and started half a dozen more during that time as well.
	<br><br>
I got to know some of the NPC's problems, concerns and desires. This was refreshing for me, a player who started playing back in beta and chose Qeynos as his first home. Since then the whole town has pretty much grown up, and there are many new things to see. I also recognized many old faces with new stories to tell. I like this town, it is rich with history and the people are easy to love, and soon I would find those I hate in it as well.
	<br><br>
As my young Paladin upstart went her way through town in search of idle chatter and donations for the Temple of Thunder, she spoke with all of the guards too. She was shocked when she spoke to a few of them and received responses such as "step aside or feel my blade" or "I am too busy defending this city of pathetic weaklings like you". The Lieutenant of the Guards was nearby at one point and she asked him about it, and he shrugged and only said that he has seen worse in Freeport than these foul tempered Guards. She was not going to settle for this answer, and took the matter to the Captain, and then the Commander of the guard himself.
	<br><br>
Kane Bayle smiled and assured her that all was well in the city, and that if there were such a rift of guards not fit to serve, he would take care of it. Then he gave her a donation and wished her well on her journeys. My Paladin was now unsure of the competence of the commander, and sought spiritual guidance back at her temple. Finally she would find someone sympathetic to her concerns. Her Guild Master too had heard of such corruption in the guards, and promised her that "the storm was coming". Then he told her of great evil in the catacombs beneath the city itself, and of our mortal enemies the Blood Sabers. Before the Knights of Thunder could act though, they need a controversial list known only as the "Bayle list" which contains the names of the corrupt guards and contacts with the Blood Sabers. With this list they could then bring these corrupt guards to justice or send them to their vile god in a box.
	<br><br>
Well you probably could have guessed that the list is missing. And thus the story might start.  Quests like these, although often frustrating, are a great common language between players. Because they are rooted in the day to day mechanics that often make it difficult to role-play; you can now start to apply these daily chores to your characters role. This is easier if you create a list of goals for your character, which can all be basic goals without much role playing value, and from there work them into your role playing efforts as well.
	<br><br>
To continue my example, my Paladin then sat down in frustration, being ill equipped and not nearly skilled enough in combat to challenge the evil that threatens the city of Qeynos. She needs gear, more information on the quest, and a lot of levels. She also isn't yet fully trusted by some of the important NPCs she will need to work with in uncovering this mystery, and most of their wants and needs are entirely different stories. So from here, she tends to the needs of the various NPCs in town, one at a time, and gains a great deal of faction in the process. Level by level, she is skilled enough to finish more of these intermediate quests on her way to her goals. Each step of the way, she has a valid role-playing base for conversation with other players rooted in the same basic non-role playing goals. Sometimes this might not actually sound all too different from anyone else shouting, "I need gnoll scalps". The line between not trying to role-play, and fitting in with the serious role players gets thinner with each little effort.
<br><br>	
The more you ask and the more you look, the more you will find there is a beautifully rich history an culture in Norrath to build a role from that is somewhat compatible with the language of day to day monster crushing chores. So try it sometime. Where are you from? Who do you serve? What do you want out of life? A little bit of pre-thinking about these questions goes a very long way when combined with the in-game quest mechanics. Most importantly, it is usually very fun to try. And good sirs, having fun is what EverQuest is all about.
