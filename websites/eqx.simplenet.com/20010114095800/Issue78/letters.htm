re:  <a href="../Issue77/quit.htm">The Day I Almost Quit EverQuest</a>
<br><br>
Please understand, there are no dedicated areas for Role Players, thus there is no mandate that Role Players be accepted.  There is only the compromise of mutual tolerance.  Be appraised that, while the charmed and amused will /tell you how much they are enjoying your role playing banter, the annoyed and irritated generally will not, if they're sociable, well-adjusted people.  You managed to find one who is neither, apparently.  My point is, just because a lot of people don't tell you you're annoying, it does NOT follow that you aren't annoying a lot of people.
<br><br>
Secondly, there is an issue of practicality.  You are sharing "scroll space" with a lot of important communication, whether it be private, group or system (A Minotaur has hit YOU for 89 pts).  When you're singing your little ditty, that eats at space others use to gauge the progress of battle, or communicate vital messages to each other.  Being a contributing factor to someone's demise is not a way to win friends.
<br><br>
Perhaps the best feature would be to have a "role play" channel in much the same way as the "ooc" or "shout" channels.  People who are not interested can turn it off, and those who don't mind can leave it on. This way, the RP'ers can feel that their play is enriched, without affecting those who find RP a waste of scroll space.  Of course, if you're going to make the point that your RP experience would not be complete if you could not inflict it on defenseless bystanders, well, that's not in the best interests of ALL the players, is it?
<br><br>
Finally, before you inevitably categorize me as a "power gamer", let me assure you that I am not.  When I play with friends I play MYSELF in this world, and my friends play THEMSELVES in this world, as if we've simply donned different visages and capabilities.  I consider this social play, not powegaming --- we are quite casual and the emphasis is on group fun, not necessarily the most cash or xp (although we don't shy away from either).  In this environment, someone spouting Elizabethan english or Troll Talk is as inappropriate, albeit occasionally humorous, as someone using "jive" or pig latin.

<em>I'm sorry Ariel, but I find your suggestion for a role playing channel to be completely inappropriate and counter to the implied spirit of the game. Just as Verant has stated time and again that ALL the servers are role playing servers, /say is the defacto in character channel. This is why they implemented /ooc, /auction and the rest. If you find my in character banter a 'waste of scroll space' then may I humbly suggest you filter out the say channel and stick with /ooc and /gsay?
<br><br>
I personally have no problem with how you play the game. I feel all of the varied viewpoints can only enrich the environment, just as different views enrich political debate. I am sorry you may find my style of gaming 'annoying'. However, do not expect me to stop role playing in a self described role playing game even if I am wasting your 'scroll space'.

I JUST read Oghma's <a href="../Issue77/what.htm">writeup</a> over why and how Verant does it's job, and how 
he thinks they've done up to this point..	
	<br><br>
			YAY!  A person that feels the exact way I do over all 
of this!  I am just TIRED of the throng of people that end up in the EQ chat 
room whining over what they think and that "I'll quit, this all sux!" and not 
hinking over JUST what is going on!..  I am a player that has been playing 
since the initial release into the populace, living through all the laggy 
packet loss problems and the UUNet "scandal".  I am still playing and 
enjoying every moment of it!  Sure, I get lag..  Sure I get tossed or 
outright Crash, but I live with it and continue on with my on-line life.  If 
I loose something, then so be it. (nothing at this point isn't replaceable 
with an hour at the most of playing.)  
<br><br>
		I guess I might consider myself lucky, or maybe I just play 
smarter then the usual joe out in EQ land.  I have never gotten so stuck 
somewhere that I had to call a GM, nor have I ever crashed in such a bad area 
that I needed a GM to get me back into shape. I have had a friend that 
"accidently" fell off the boat from Freeport to Kaladim, he called a GM.  The 
GM PROMPTLY got back to him (He said no longer then 5 minutes), helped him to 
an island and told him how to get back to a boat all in character!  
<br><br>
		Now, I wonder why all the other people that "Never got a GM" 
did so?  Was their petition not phrased in such a way to warrant a quick 
response?  Or did they even ask for it in the first place, by just calling 
one?  Noone knows.
<br><br> 
		I thank Oghma for writing such a wonderful atricle!  Thank 
you for voicing what I have wanted to scream across all of Norrath!

Could you pass this on to Archanalia for me please.  I don't have everquest 
yet but that guy is too f'in' funny Not to let him know now.
<br><br>
Dear Archanalia,
<br><br>
     I have just read your two articles on the gender issues in role playing 
on EQX.  The articles were fine and if anyone is giving you grief about the 
articles smack them in the back of the head and ignore them.  (I don't have 
EQ yet because i promised the wife i would not get it until after the baby 
is born. 3 months and counting!  I don't know if I am more excited about the 
baby or EQ!  What a great month that will be!  Anyhow, I digress...)
<br><br>
  The real reason I am writing this is because of <a href="../credits/archy.htm">Lil’ Archy</a>.  They are 
really funny!  That prom dress clip (or what ever type of dress) was so 
hilarious!  I can’t wait to read more!  And don’t worry about the color of 
the hat!  I am sure he has more then one.  Keep it up.

Absor, 
 <br><br>
First, I read every issue of EQX and I thoroughly enjoy it (much thanks to you).
 <br><br>
Now to the point.  I have been thinking about this and how the ecperience loss change really affects me as a character and as a player.  I thought that if I looked back to my death experiences in Norrath and tried to remember what I was thinking and how I felt when I knew death was imminent, I would get a better picture of what was important to me.  
 <br><br>
One Norrathian day, soon after my guild acceptance, I heard that my guildleader and assistant guildleader were heading into Befallen to adventure.  They had never been there before and I had a little experience with the dungeon so I offered to come and help show them around, they agreed.  Now, they were two levels higher and four levels higher, respectively, and I was feeling pretty brave as I ran around Befallen.  Perhaps a little too brave.  Knowing help was only a few seconds away, I headed around a corner, opened the next door and barged in.  Instantly I was falling.  Now I had heard that there were places in Befallen that if you happened to fall into them your corpse was as good as gone.  So my split-second fear was that I was going to lose EVERYTHING (equipment) I had worked so hard to get.  I wasn't the least bit worried about experience nor remotely concerned that I lost a level for my foolhardy indiscretion.  In that half second of falling, I saw my self looting corpses outside the city gates just to scrape up enough to myself a loaf of bread and a drink of water.  And spending another month just to regain all I had lost.
 <br><br>
Anyway, I only fell one level down to the 3rd level.  I quickly looked around and knew I had only a few seconds to try to get as close to the exit as I could before the six or more various undead bled me out on the cold stone floor.
 <br><br>
I knew I would be able to eventually get my corpse and did after dying six times and losing two-thirds of a level.  (The corpse recovery is an exciting and memorable story in itself.)
 <br><br>
Now I look back and remember the fear of losing my stuff and the adventure of recovering my corpse.  What I didn't mind was losing all that experience for my character.  What I gained was the "experience" I received as a player, the challenge of recovering what was most important to me as a character, my equipment.  Without the equipment, levels (especially after 18) are of minor importance when protecting yourself from the multitude of nasties.  Equipment and levels go hand in hand, and levels are alot easier to get.  
 <br><br>
To emphasize my point (if thats necessary), I have been trying to think of ways to adventure to get some of the items I desire without taking the chance of losing what I have.  But then I really find myself in a mental quandary when I realize that there is no point to getting the "high level item" if I'm never gonna use it for fear of losing it.  To me, that is the risk I am taking in Norrath everyday when I head out to explore and conquer.  Death is but a minor risk and always has been.
 <br><br>
Please don't tell Verant.  If they "fix" that, the game will soon become another "might get five bucks for it at the used software store" game.  
 <br><br>
Hope this is a little food for thought.
 <br><br>
Thanks for listening,

<em>Well, in a way I agree with you.  I don't like that EQ is all about not losing your stuff instead of bravery and adventure.  But there needs to be something to make death sting.  Heck, I'd rather lose a stat point on death and have all of our 'stuff'.  I dunno, I wish I had a better idea, but I don't like the trend we're seeing.  Tell me this, how much excitement would there have been in your exploration of Befallen if you couldn't have lost anything at all upon your death?  *shrug*

<p style="text-align: justify">
I simply wanted to state that Absor's Editorial in issue 77 of EQX was right on the money.  You stated what I have been thinking and saying since beta 4 (actually, it's true!), and I couldn't agree with your points more.
 <br><br>
I do find it interesting that role-playing cannot be defined, yet there is a switch so that you can be role-playing...
 <br><br>
I find it even more interesting that cheap "homogenizations" are being tested and developed, in place of dynamic quests and developed storylines.  Whatever happened to the story?  I almost forgot who Miragul was...
 <br><br>
This might come off a little harsh, as I am very unhappy with EQ, and MMORPGs in general.  Both players and developers are doing nothing for the genre.  We are co-dependant.  The developers decide what players will strongly influence their world, and the players interact with the tools that the developers give them.  You were right in your first paragraph when you stated that this "RP switch" is not a tool.
 <br><br>
Keep up the wonderful work, guys.  I enjoy your site every week, and I hope people listen to this one in particular.

<em>Now don't give up yet!  The few (suprisingly few it seems) that have written to say that they agreed with me have sounded very down on the game, like they were planning on giving up.  And that bugs me.  I don't want to be adding fuel to that fire.  Don't quit.  If we all quit, then they win and EQ becomes... vanilla.

<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
Dear Absor,
<br><br>
You are wrong. This is not an opinion, it is a fact.
<br><br>
I am one of the people who requested a role playing switch from Verant. I
am not "too stupid" as you imply in your article, to figure out when people
are role playing. I also am not trying to be divisive, and I resent your
implication that that is my motive for wanting such a switch.
<br><br>
The reason that I, and most of the others who made the request, want this
switch is because we're tired of being mocked by losers because we
role-play. If you don't believe this happens, just read one of the other
articles in this week's issue by Ahtenret. And please don't tell me that I
should just do what I want and not let it bother me. It is not for you to
tell me what I should or should not be bothered by.
<br><br>
I want to know who the people are who would welcome role-playing, whether
through speech or emotes. This switch will mean less wasted game time for
me while trying to locate and meet these types of people. Contrary to what
you seem to think, people who want to role-play are NOT always doing it;
some of us feel a little uncertain and self-conscious. And having other
players stand around and call us geeks doesn't help.
<br><br>
Face it, the kind of people who want to role-play and the kind who don't
are two distinctly different groups. They rarely wish to interact. The
switch merely gives everyone the opportunity to find others with the same
interests. I think your assertion that the switch is divisive is inane and
irrational. You failed to support it with logical arguments in your article. 
<br><br>
Frankly, I dispise people like you seem to be; people who feel obliged to
constantly state an opinion that is contrary to popular belief as a cheap
and easy way of pretending they're individuals. People who assume that
anyone who does something they don't like MUST have some malevolent and
ulterior motives. People who call themselves "open-minded", and yet feel
compelled to insult everyone who doesn't share their opinions of right and
wrong.
<br><br>
I'd say I'm sorry if any of this offends you, but I'm not. That's how I
felt after reading your editorial, and I'm sure I'm not alone. You were way
out of line, and I suggest you think a bit more the next time you're
desperate for a story idea, so that you don't wind up making so much of an
ass of yourself.
<br><br>

<br><br>
P.S. I really don't care if you respond to this or not, but be aware that I
won't be writing back in any case. And if Everquest Express cost money, I
would cancel my subscription.
<br><br>
<em>Well, first off I don't think that it was your intention to be divisive, but I do think that will be the result.
<br><br>
And how is this switch going to prevent the losers from mocking you?  I've played EQ for a LOT of hours, and I've never been mocked.  But I know it happens.  Guess what, if they were going to mock you for roleplaying, they'll do it more if you have a silly purple name that reminds them that you're roleplaying.
<br><br>
As for 'wasted' play time, I don't see that.  Have fun.  Play with those around you.  You'd be suprised how many 'non-roleplayers' will respond in character if you just act in character towards them.  This switch will put off all the folks that would be willing to roleplay, but are not sure how.  They will be excluded by you because they aren't confident enough to be labeled a roleplayer.
<br><br>
Hmmm.  And you accuse me of being angry and close-minded.  Yet you are the only person to respond to my editorial with any anger.  Many people responded to tell me that they thought my opinion was wrong, but, with one exception, none of them got angry.  They all were willing to acknowledge that it was my opinion, and that I was entitled to it, even if they disagreed.
<br><br>
Oh, and you know what, I don't have any need to write anything.  If you knew me, you'd know that I'll toss out a half page of nothing, or skip and editorial if I have nothing to say that week.  But you don't know me.  You've decided to hate me, and that's fine, I suppose.  I'd prefer that you understood what I wrote instead of being angered by it.  But I have no intention of pleasing everyone, that's just not possible.
<br><br>
So even if you don't respond, please think about what I've written.  Consider my responses to your reasons that this switch is needed.  Or not, that's up to you.
<br><br>

Okay, so this one is late.  And only comes from your so vehement continued 
objections.
<br><br>
I still do not understand why the still significant experience loss is not 
enough of a penalty for you?  I have still managed to do the level Yo-Yo with 
the change.  About the only difference it has caused me is that instead being 
so mad a blood vessel in my head pops... I just faint from the frustration, 
because it is a bit easier to get back ... but STILL hard as heck.
<br><br>
And my character, even role-playing cares.  It is not a matter of getting 
that number.  My character wants the power that learning gives him.  The more 
he learns, the better spells and pets he gets, the more power to make the 
world pay.  And dying because the world glutted (25% of my deaths are from 
that, not griffs teleporting from nowhere to attack me...) is more than 
frustrating.  This alleviates that problem to an extent.

<em>Oh, I dunno.  A friend of mine was killed 4 time in one evening (at 21st level where the exp loss is pretty steap), and he gained exp for the night.  Sorry, but the loss is not significant anymore.  People have been sending me letters telling me that they dread retrieving their corpse so much more then regaining lost exp.

I don't know what else to tell you, these are the things I know.
