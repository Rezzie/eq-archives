Monsters, monsters, every where,<br>
Flashing teeth, flying hair. <br>
What shall a woman use to fight? <br>
Cleavage of course, breasts bound tight. 
<br><br>
Attack a gnoll, watch its eyes spin. <br>
Her decollete' has done him in. <br>
Crush a bear, strike him down, <br>
Not with a sword, just a low gown. 
<br><br>
Should a grey wolf grasp at your leg, <br>
No need to whine, no need to beg. <br>
Simply bend down, smile on your face, <br>
He'll see your chest, and die in place. 
<br><br>
Be bra soft blue, or brown and laced, <br>
A female char has the fight aced. <br>
For bosoms, breasts, however known <br>
Drop monsters dead with a fading moan. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
An additional stanza:
<br><br>
And don't forget another case, <br>
Of cleavage in another race. <br>
Forget the front and check the back, <br>
The mighty trolls have crack attack! <br>
