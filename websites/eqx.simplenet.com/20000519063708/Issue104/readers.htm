Well, we asked you all to tell us what you liked most about the last two years of EverQuest Express, and you did.  We wanted to be able to point newer readers to the best of EQX.  And it's the readers that know what was best.  Thanks for responding to our poll.  The results were wonderful to read.  You've given us a good sense of what sort of things we did right during our first two years.  And we were very pleased to get all of your comments, despite one's like this:
<br><br>
<b>Which staff member would you want to meet in Norrath:</b>  "<em>Lrets cuz he's sooo dreamy</em>" - Balrog
<br><br>
I mean, really...  like we wouldn't recognize your penmanship, Lrets...
<br><br>
Actually, we appreciate Lrets' humor and his wonderful Fit to Print articles.  Just don't tell him that.
<br><br>
So what were your favorite things?  After much reading and counting and color coding your responses, I gave up trying to actually do any sort of scientific accounting of what you liked best.  But I'm pretty good and eyeballing distances, so I figure a good guess is the best way to go.
<br><br>
The most mentioned single item seems to have been Aklar's <a href="rogueall.htm">Rogue: A Tale of Treachery</a>.  It figures, you guys liked most one of the things that we can't give you.  But what we can do is offer you a complete version.  Well, as complete as it gets.  With EQX being a periodical, the tale was split up over 19 installments.  But the link above will lead you to a single page with all 19 parts.  If you haven't read it before, now is a good time.  And when Aklar gets published, we'll let you know where to buy her book.
<br><br>
And while we're talking about Aklar, many of you loved Auntie Moog.  Aklar was the voice of that doting Troll.  In fact, we received a response from a young, boisterous bard named Kyodai, whom you may know from a Bard's Log.  In response to the question about who he would most like to meet in Norrath, he replied:  <em>"Auntie Moog. To thank her for her help, and possibly hook her up with Gargatox so the lummox will leave me alone!"</em>
<br><br>
I'm also seeing that a lot of you like Lil' Archy.  Several of you mentioned the Lil' Archy from issue #90, this one, <a href="../Issue90/archy45.htm">right here</a>.  <em>"But I think number 45 is the best. Skeletons are funny...in a morbid kind of way. (gotta love the zombie, heh heh) - Kyodai</em>...  again.
<br><br>
Shadoe, a bright fellow in his own right, suggested that the best Lil' Archy was: <em>"Specifically, the one that begins with "The judge has entered the court, and the litigants are ready.  Let's listen in…"  I still bust a gut when the case is dismissed with <a href="../Issue69/archy24.htm">Snaffu's mere shrug</a>!"</em>
<br><br>
But Archy is more popular than probably most of you are aware.  Another of the things that many of you liked bestest were the adds for Fit to Print.  It just so happens that Archy is responsible for most of those adds.  Nobody was willing to mention a particular advertisement, though, so you'll have to look through the whole <a href="../credits/archart.htm">Archy Gallery</a> to find them.
<br><br>
But that's just the fluff.  You know, the comics and the pretty pictures, nothing important (I can say that because I don't do art or comics).  All right, I'm only kidding.  I love that stuff too.  But it seems that another of your most favorite things was Oghma in his various forms.  The best compliment that we received was about one of Oghma's articles.
<br><br>
<em>Oghma - "<a href="../Issue37/shake.htm">How to Shake Up the EverQuest Community</a>," Issue 37 - Without a doubt my very favorite thing published in  EQX! - Shadoe</em>.
<br><br>
When you folks mentioned Oghma, you gave us such a wide variety of his stuff, stories, articles, editorials...  I'm just going to list a few, it'll be quicker that way:
<br><br>
<a href="../Issue75/romance.htm">The Romance of Role-Playing in Issue 75</a>.<br>
The Religion and Race series of Articles - starting with <a href="../Issue61/religion1.htm">Religion and Race: The Dark Elves</a>.<br>
<a href="../Issue99/edito.htm">Editorial from Issue 99 - about group strategy</a>.
<br><br>
Now, to be fair to me, a few of you seemed hard pressed to decide which editorials you liked best.  So, let me mention two of mine that you chose.
<br><br>
<a href="../Issue92/edita.htm">Editorial from Issue 92 - about other possible game universes</a>.<br>
<a href="../Issue100/edita.htm">Editorial from Issue 100 - Multiple Character Disorder and real life</a>.
<br><br>
And of course many of you love <a href="../credits/qanda.htm">Q & A</a> and Nepenthia.  If you're new to EverQuest, or even if you're a veteran, there will be a lot of useful and entertaining information for you there.
<br><br>
When readers AND staff point to one article as something that they liked about our past, it needs to be mentioned a few times.  "<a href="../Issue20/wife.htm">How to Geektify Your Wife</a>" is a great read and a great introduction to the humor and wit that is Razor.
<br><br>
There were also a few things that people mentioned that were kind of obscure when they were published, and are even more so now.  I think they're worth bringing to your attention.
<br><br>
<a href="../credits/follies.htm">Fake Follies</a> came from the creative mind of Wynn.  Back before the beta test, or in the early stages, all we had to look at were a few screen shots scattered across the net.  So Wynn took the liberty of putting the staff in Norrath...  Thanks for reminding us, Athene.
<br><br>
"<a href="../credits/halfling.htm">101 Uses for a Dead Halfling</a>".  From Archy...  that's all the explanation it needs.
<br><br>
You also recommended <a href="../credits/bardlog.htm">Bard's Log</a>.  No shock there.  :)
<br><br>
The other thing that we asked you was which of our staff would you like most to meet in Norrath.  You were all very generous, and I don't think it's right for me to just add up the replies and say that one staff member is your favorite.  Besides, Oghma would just get a swelled head.
<br><br>
But I gotta know...  Is this a threat, or a compliment?
<br><br>

<br><br>
We're very grateful to everyone that filled out the poll.  Your insights were certainly useful to us.  And I suspect others will be interested to see what you liked about EverQuest Express over the last two years.
