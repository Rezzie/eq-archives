Affecting many mobs, generating lots of damage (and my golden rule of
AE spell assessment)</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Affecting many
mobs</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Affecting several mobs is what is primarily
expected from AE spells. However, only PB spells (and maybe Gravity
spells, I'm not sure) can affect mobs in real large (unlimited)
numbers; the other spells have a hit count, with a limit inherent to
the spell line. Column spells can affect easily up 3 mobs, and 4 mobs
with difficulty. Al'Kabor spells can affect easily up to 5 mobs. Rain
spells can rather easily affect up to 4 mobs, but are probably the
least rewarding AE spells in terms of affecting many mobs, because
they produce strong effects only when used on 1 or 2 mobs (they are
hybrids between DD spells and AE spells).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now, if affecting many mobs is a primary
expectation, is it a reward in itself ? Obviously, it depends on how
each mob is affected, and on how the effects (especially damage) add
up.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Generating lots of
damage</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An AE spell usually inflicts less damage on a
single mob than a DD spell. But adding up the damage done to several
mobs may give a figure comfortably higher than the damage done by DD.
This maximal damage figure should be handled with extreme caution,
because damage has variable value. Some spells can generate lots of
high-value damage in some settings (and this is excellent), whereas
other spells (or the same spells in other settings) will generate
lots of low-value damage only. Low-value damage is damage which you
don't care to inflict: mainly weak, grazing damage, irritating the
mobs without bringing them noticeably closer to death, or damage
inflicted to a low-green mob, on which you wouldn't want to waste a
DD (your fighters can dispose of those with minimal sweat expense),
and also damage inflicted to a particularly dangerous mob, which you
don't want to provoke before your fighters tackle it directly.
</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">My golden rule of AE
spell assessment</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Affecting many mobs and/or generating lots
of damage is rewarding if, and only if, the spell does something
worthwile to each mob.</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#AF0000">B) Brutal
kill</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Depends on: strength and other
criteria</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Doing strong damage per mob is a general reward
of all damage spells; Wizards tend to like the spells doing the
highest damage, and rightly so. Strong spells need to be cast a
relatively small number of times to produce a result, so, strength is
also a condition of swiftness in general (a weak spell may have a
good single-cast swiftness, but only a strong spell will have a good
chain-cast swiftness).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">With respect to strength, AE spells are
generally not very rewarding: with the controversial exception of
Rains, a "strong" AE spell does about 75% of your strongest Shock's
damage per mob; be content with it.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">One big shot</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Depends on: strength and damage
multiplier</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Even with a bad mana-efficiency and a bad
swiftness, a spell may help you score a "brutal kill", provided that
it is strong. A high damage multiplier tells you that you can score
mass "brutal kills" with the spell, but if and only if the spell has
good strength. The typical example is the level 49 PB spell Super
Nova. A weak AE damage spell with excellent chain-cast swiftness
could do the same trick through repeated cast ("bunch of quick shots"
instead of "one big shot"), but there is none available.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Finish one and proceed to
next</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Depends on: strength and single-cast
swiftness</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is one of the easiest and most discreet AE
tactics. If the spell is strong and swift enough, you can time the
casting so that the spell significantly helps your fighters finish
off their current target, while starting to damage the additional
mobs. This is not as brutal as using DD for finishoff, so, it is
worthwile mostly if combined with a damage/mana reward.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Standing-in for
DD</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Depends on: all criteria, but mostly
strength and damage concentration</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">AE spells may serve you more if you have no
suitable (reliable and strong) DD for your level. Most Rains are
potentially stronger than DD on 1 mob, but you will reject Rains
because they're slow and unreliable, unless the strength difference
versus your DD is important (the difference is quite important at
level 4 and post-50). The same is somewhat true for other AE damage
spells post-50: their use is encouraged by the absence of strong new
DD.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, unless a mere single-cast contribution
is expected from you, "standing-in for DD" also requires that you can
significantly help the kill through repeated cast without wasting
your mana, so, damage concentration is important too. Depending on
circumstances, swiftness may also be a factor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#AF0000">C)
Multiple kill through multiple cast</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Depends on: damage concentration, and
also chain-cast swiftness</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Even if you don't intend to solo with an AE
spell, measuring its single-handed kill potential is the hard
approach for assessing how lethal it is. Even in a group, you are
supposed to be able to pour a nice quantity of damage in the hard
fights, and this often implies that you are able to kill (or at least
severely wound) a mob single-handed when necessary. Leaving aside
swiftness and defensive issues, you can do that only by making the
most out of your mana; but playing AE damage spells is not always
using your mana wisely.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Damage concentration is the AE damage/mana per
mob, versus the damage/mana of DD. You might wonder why bother with
the "damage/mana per mob": are AE spells supposed to be used on only
one mob ? Here's my answer: </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">if you want
to kill a pack of mobs with an AE spell, the spell must be able to
kill each mob separately</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> (adaptation of
my golden rule of AE spell assessment).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a result, you WANT to know if your mana
supply allows you to kill the considered mobs through exclusive,
repeated use of your AE spell (assuming you have enough time and you
are safe). The answer lies is damage concentration, and more clearly
than you may think: an AE damage spell is able to kill a pack of mobs
(with repeated use) if, and only if, the spell's damage concentration
(%) is at least equal to the proportion of mana bar (%) which must be
consumed to kill one of the mobs with DD.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Example 1</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: if
you can kill a given mob with DD consuming 70% of your mana bar, a
Column spell with a damage concentration of 70% will allow you to
kill several such mobs at once instead of one, but you will consume
all your mana instead of 70%.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Example 2</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: an
Al'Kabor spell with a damage concentration of 40% may kill only the
kind of mobs which you can kill with 2 bubbles of DD, that is, green
mobs.</FONT></P>

<P><TABLE BORDER=1>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Boring math proving the
         above</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">: let's say that you must
         consume N% of your mana bar to kill a mob with DD. You can
         look at it the other way: consuming your full mana bar, you
         are able to kill 100/N such mobs with DD. So, the
         damage/mana of your DD spell can be thought of as "100/N
         mobs killed per full mana bar". If you want to use your AE
         spell instead (and kill any allowed number of these mobs at
         once), you want to make sure that you are able to kill ONE
         mob by means of consuming your full mana bar, so, you want
         your AE spell to have a damage/mana of at least "1 mob
         killed per full mana bar". So, the damage concentration of
         your AE spell (your AE spell's damage/mana per mob versus
         your DD spell's damage/mana) must be at least "1 mob killed
         per full mana bar" / "100/N mobs killed per full mana bar",
         that is, 1/100/N, or N/100, or N%, QED. </FONT>
      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An AE spell doing such diluted damage that
low-blue mobs can't be killed with repeated cast should provide HUGE
side rewards to be attractive versus other damage spells.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">While the key criterion, for killing with
repeated cast, is damage concentration, chain-cast swiftness also has
practical importance (poor chain-cast swiftness comes from
insufficient strength and/or long cast and recast times): having
enough mana in store is fine, but killing the mobs before they can do
excessive harm is even better, and you will somehow run out of time
if your magic is too slow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The exemplary records of killing mobs
exclusively with repeated AE damage spells (made possible by high
damage concentration and fair swiftness) are: </FONT><FONT

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Depends on: single-cast swiftness and/or
chain-cast swiftness</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Verant often insists that Wizard spells should
shine more with their swiftness than with their sheer damage or
mana-efficiency. Wizards have a rather clear perception of the
swiftness of their DD spells (even if they like damage most); not so
for AE spells. Swiftness is possibly the most vaguely perceived
dimension of the AE damage spells, probably because the AE spells
very rarely have an equal or shorter cast time than DD spells, and
furthermore have a hold time (they aren't chain-castable), so they
have an overall reputation of being slow. As an application of my
golden rule of AE spell assessment, the spells can bring a reward in
terms of mass swiftness if, and only if, they damage each creature
reasonably swiftly; in other words, you may select the less clumsy
spells, and try and take advantage of their fair swiftness on mass
scale. Rewards usually don't depend mainly on swiftness criteria, but
the swiftness criteria have a side importance for most rewards (see
above and below).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">AE spell rotation</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An old trick to overcome hold time (and create
an imitation of chain-casting) is to rotate two or three AE spells.
The mechanical and size differences don't allow every AE spell to be
rotated effectively with every other, but some combinations are
fruitful (especially PB and Columns; post-50 Rains can possibly be
rotated with DD). Usually, one of the spells will be better than the
other(s), and the other(s) will fill in the gap during the best
spell's hold time.</FONT></P>

Damage/mana gambling</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Depends mostly on: 2-hit and 3-hit
damage/mana bonus</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is a basic motivation for using AE spells:
generate more damage than DD for the mana, with tolerable added
personal exposure and tolerable loss of brutality. This was my main
focus when I first took interest in AE spells; but, with time, I came
to appreciate other rewards more (especially "mob herding" below).
Note that I'm not covering here the narrow high-risk-high-gain
applications (I think this is rather "multiple kill through repeated
use" above). Pre-50, the gambling is most often a kind of sport (to
maximize performance), best limited to easy fights; post-50, it may
be necessary to gamble on a more regular basis (to uphold
contribution), because the DD spells are a bit short. I believe that
an AE damage spell is good for damage/mana gambling if 3 hits
generate a sizeable damage/mana bonus versus DD; it is even better if
2 hits also generate a bonus (the spell will serve more often,
repaying the memorization slot). A spell which depends on hitting 4
times (or more) to generate a sizeable bonus (Al'Kabor spells, some
PB spells, pre-50 Rains) can't be regularly played with tolerable
risk and good success (use other spells instead). Note that PB
spells, being zero-range, expose you more than range spells, so, they
are inherently less good than others for casual damage/mana gambling.
My own piece of advice: when gambling with your damage/mana, keep an
eye on your group's health, and constantly consider reverting to good
old brutal DD (or non-damage mob incapacitation) if the fight proves
less easy than you initially thought.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Beware that, when you are using for gambling
purposes an AE spell which is not of your highest rank available, the
damage/mana bonus versus your highest-rank Shock is not as high as
indicated in my tables; you may have to recalculate it. The typical
recalculation is for Columns, which are such convenient spells that
they tend to have an extended lifespan; I made a specific
table.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#AF0000">F) Mass
taunt, mob herding</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Depends on: strength, swiftness
criteria</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Wizards are excellent taunters, through various
means (DD, Skin spells, Staff of Temperate Flux). A Wizard can herd a
mob about anywhere despite of opposite attraction. AE damage spells
allow to move mob packs (towards you) and/or split them. A basic and
efficient tactic is to AE Snare them first with Bonds of Force, so
that they can't reach you easily. Now, the tactical reward depends
completely on how your group operates, and on what you want to
achieve (the reward may be null, or the mob-pulling may be a backfire
instead of a reward if you are unprepared). Mob herding is easy in
the early fight, but harder in the late fight, when the mobs have
accumulated much hate against the tanks. Rotating two spells, or
casting twice or more the same spell with moderate recast time, may
be necessary. There would be tactically some room for a quick, strong
and/or chain-castable AE damage spell, even with poor
mana-efficiency, acting as a taunting "red button", but there is none
(the proposed application has the same requirements than killing with
"one big shot", with added need for swiftness; so, you may be tempted
to use PB spells, but you will get immediate retaliation, which is
annoying. Al'Kabor spells would be perfect candidates for the
application, if only they were not so slow and weak).</FONT></P>

applications</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Interrupting
spells</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Some PB spells and Al'Kabor spells interrupt
spellcasting, either not for sure through pushback, or for sure (if
not resisted) with split-second stun (like Force Shock does). Unless
the spell is to be used at random, this is valuable only if the cast
time is short, and if the reward is not paid for with weak damage
and/or diluted damage/mana.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Debuffing</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Wizards don't have means of putting resistance
penalties or other lasting effects on mobs, except movement-hampering
(Root, Snare). They have the Staff of Temperate Flux as a single-mob
small debuff against heat and cold (but, even though the debuff is
small, the Staff is very powerful as a distance gauge and aggro
accumulator). Wizards could have AE debuff without single-mob debuff,
in the same way they have AE Snare without single-target Snare. Why
the idea ? First, there was, for a long time in 1999, some
misinformation in most spell databases: Cast Force was said to drain
Strength from the target, and I even read once that Enegy Storm was
draining Stamina. This is all false. Second, I know at least one AE
damage spell which has a side debuff effect: the level 49 Druid spell
"Ice", which does a 50 debuff against heat (but lasting only a very
short time). There are no such rewards for the Wizard AE damage
spells, but, the game is changing often (I would say that Al'Kabor
spells are good candidates for a fix in the form of added debuff
against the energy type of same-rank DD).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Gaining faction</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Some insist that using minor AE spells at
dungeon entrances, when there are trains, allow them to accumulate
quickly the desired faction adjustments. Low-level PB spells are the
best for that purpose, thanks to their absence of mob count
limitation.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Bar-room brawling</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You may use AE damage spells just for the fun
(or nuisance) of it, casting in the middle of mob trains or, worse,
in PvP areas, where there is no player count limitation, at weddings
(I hit 60 players at once with an Al'Kabor spell once, then died
within seconds, if only because five pets came for me immediately).
This is, of course, not a very consistent reward.</FONT></P>
