<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Drawbacks in the form of backfire risks are not
an absolute nuisance, and can be dealt with. They are much less
annoying than the inherently poor stats of some spells.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Aggroing mobs </FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is difficult to predict the mobs' reaction
to AE damage, less easy than to predict a mob's reaction to DD.
Experience gives a feel, but all attempts to lay down precaution
guidelines (assuming you want to avoid mob retaliation) have failed.
Overall, it's the same as for DD: don't cast too soon in the fight,
don't cast from a range, and wear your Skin spell at all times. It
has been said that the mobs were truly acting as a pack, as long as
all the player fighters were beating at the same ("main") mob, so,
nothing wrong would happen to you as long as you don't aggro the main
mob; this is false. It has been said that targeting a player tank
(instead of one of the mobs) would direct the aggro against the tank,
or at least lessen the aggro directed towards you; this is also
false. The experimental proofs are hard to produce, but many Wizards
have testified against these theories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The psychology of a pack of mobs is very mixed:
each mob is governed all at once by its loyalty to fellow mobs, by
its desire for personal revenge, and by the principle of giving some
priority to the easiest task; and it is not easy to say when the
scales are tipped. It is possible that the lowest-level mobs in the
pack think more of themselves (and attack you more easily), maybe
because the damage from the AE spell represents a higher proportion
of their hit points. Your level and life bar, compared with the level
and life bar of other players, also count, because mobs find it
easier to bully the lowest-level or near-dead players, unless the
higher-level or healthier players are particularly good taunters.
Many "intelligent" mobs also seem to over-react to spells being cast
at them, damage nonwithstanding. A particular case is when there's a
master mob with a pet in the crowd: unless the master mob is your
tanks' main target, the AE spell roughly aggroes that mob pair
double, because the pet cares only for itself and its master (not for
its master allies) and will instantly perceive you as enemy number
one; the master mob, in turn, takes the pet's decision into account,
and is likely to assist the pet against you (the master hardly ever
calls the pet back).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Anyway, being attacked as a consequence of
playing an AE spell is not always "backfire". More often than not, I
am happy when I am attacked by one mob (or even by several mobs,
provided that they are Snared and I can walk them around). I often
play a Column early in a fight, so that I can both help the fighters
with damage, and pull a mob away from them for Rooting purposes. Even
arousing the main mob may be perceived as a success, if you're
actively trying to pull all the mobs to give your endangered tank a
break. Still, the low predictability of AE spells is a challenge, and
one might wish for some split between very-low-aggro spells and
rather-high-aggro spells (but I don't want to start guessing how the
split should be determined). The aggro from AE damage was apparently
lowered twice, in patches, since the game was created (the second
time was in early 2000). While lower aggro promotes safer and more
popular use of the spells, it would probably not be sound to have the
aggro lowered further, because this would diminish the value of the
spells as voluntary taunting tools.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I haerd a few Wizards wishing that the aggro
from AE spells be officially redirected to the target player, when a
party member is the target. This "fix" would have far-reaching
harmful effects on gameplay, because, first, it is dubious that you
should ever be allowed to generate aggro toward another player (there
is a consent issue, even if the player is a party member; see the
specific page on scattered spells for dismissing the "damage shield"
case), and, second, this would so greatly help your tanks with their
basic job of taunting, that the fights would become very predictable
and boring (fighters fight mobs, healers over-heal undisturbed,
casters over-nuke undisturbed).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Aggroing
passers-by</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is very annoying, and happens with Bonds
of Force as well as with AE damage spells: a nearby friendly or
neutral NPC will be caught in the area of effect and attack you,
possibly killing you (some NPCs, such as guards, are tough) or
forcing you to flee just because you don't want to bear the negative
faction from killing it. With any luck, you will be able to Root the
NPC away and continue to assist your group a bit before you have to
Gate out. Keep your eyes open !</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Breaking
Mesmerize</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(Mesmerize is a long stun which is broken if
the mob takes damage).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When there is an Enchanter in your group, it's
all-or-nothing: either he/she uses Mesmerize, and your AE is shut off
(breaking Mesmerize is a major backfire severely frowned upon), or
he/she uses stun, and this is compatible with your AE. If you're not
very motivated, or if the Enchanter is of lesser level, it's best to
let him/her stick to Mesmerize as usual. But, if you have a
particularly good AE damage spell available, and you feel ready to
use it whenever there's more than one mob around, you should try and
persuade your group to switch to rotated stun spells instead of
Mesmerize (preferably the Enchanter's PB "color" spells) to give you
free hands. Enchanters may enjoy the variety too. The knowledge that
some Wizard AE damage spells are powerful has spread somewhat, and I
believe that groups are not as reluctant as before to give up the
"safe" Mesmerize in favor of stun and AE damage. The incompatibility
with Mesmerize tends to make AE damage a part-time ability, but, with
time, I found out that the opportunities to use AE damage were still
many, with or without Enchanter.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Saturating the graphic
cards</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Many AE spells have heavy particle effects
which will create huge temporary lag or even system crash, for the
weakest computers. This is worst when several AE spells are cast
simultaneously. In any settings where AE spells are heavily used, the
particle density should be shut off (even if the spells look
unfortunately less pretty).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">The "rogue pet"
bug</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is different from the widely-known "pet
bug" (pets absorbing part of the allowed hits which should go to
mobs, a nuisance especially in the case of Rains). If the player
master of a pet goes linkdead and you use an AE spell touching the
pet, the pet may go rogue and attack you (and you have NO means of
withholding the attack, not even Root). This is a second-hand report;
I never witnessed that bug. I'm also speaking of carebear play, not
PvP.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Hurting yourself</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You will hurt yourself with Rain spells,
Al'Kabor spells, Gravity spells, and Thunderbold (as well as Snare
yourself with Bonds of Force), if you don't cast it from sufficient
distance.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Hurting allies in
PvP</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">AE spells are generally considered unplayable
in PvP, because they harm your allies in addition to your foes. I
don't know any means of getting around this - or, if some means can
be devised (such as using an AE spell of an energy type against which
your allies have good resistance), the reward will probably not be
worth the trouble (most rewards are already problematic on carebear
servers).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Z-axis
aberrations</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This varies from zone to zone depending on zone
design, but the use of AE spells in dungeons will sometimes pull mobs
from other floors (generally below you), or from behind walls. This
is felt especially when you are near a pit, and there are mobs at the
bottom of the pit: they are likely to come for you. There is nothing
much to do about it, except not do the mistake twice in a given
location. A related matter which is not quite "backfire", is that yu
can't use AE spells as a way to shoot around a corner. Each of the
mobs to be affected has to be in line of sight; mobs which are around
a corner will not be hit, even if they are theoretically within the
spell's radius.</FONT></P>
