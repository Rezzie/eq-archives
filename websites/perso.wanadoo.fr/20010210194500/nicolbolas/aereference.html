<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Number-crunching
philosophy</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is a huge mass of calculations behind my
work, but massive calculations don't prove anything as long as they
don't go in the right direction. The essential part of the work is to
define the rewards expected from AE damage spells, and to define the
numeric criteria:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- accurately reflecting the feeling you have
when you use the spells,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- revealing the rewards which you can (or
can't) get out of the spells (rewards of which you may have a
truncated or inaccurate feeling when you first use the
spells),</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- allowing to share the impressions and
discoveries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Nothing is final in what I write (I come up
with new things and/or change my mind about something every month),
but I think I have now gathered one of the best knowledge bases
publicized on the topic.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Damage, mana-efficiency, and
swiftness</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The first thing you need to know about a spell
is what kind of effect it has, on whom, and how; so, you will want to
have a functional description covering range, radius, number of mobs
affected, miscellaneous mechanical features, etc. The functional
description has an influence on the assessment, but is only a
preliminary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">All damage spells are meant to be lethal in
some way or another. Direct damage spells are very lethal in every
way you can imagine, but, for instance, you can feel some difference,
beyond level 50, between "large" DD (Ice Comet) and "short and
mana-efficient" DD (Draughts); the two are lethal in slightly
different ways. This is what happens right from the start with AE
damage spells: they don't have the standardized, optimized stats of
DD spells, they may be lethal in one way and not in another, and you
must assess separately their damage, mana-efficiency, and swiftness,
if you want to know how they can help you kill your opponents.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Maximum potential and casual
potential</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The maximum potential of an AE spell depends
directly on the number of mobs it is allowed to affect (or on the
number of hits it is allowed to generate). Functional features such
as range, radius, resistance, and other mechanics, are a measure of
the difficulty to achieve the maximum potential.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Some criteria will measure the maximum
potential of the spells, and will serve especially the most ambitious
Wizards.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Other criteria will measure the easy, casual
potential of the spells. I believe that the best way to assess AE
damage spells on an even basis for casual play is to consider 3 mobs
affected or 3 hits generated. All the AE spells are able to affect
reasonably easily 3 mobs or generate 3 hits, and a Wizard will
usually not want to affect more than 3 mobs without the backup of a
specially briefed group.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Assessing AE versus
DD</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Your direct damage is your all-purpose
first-choice offense.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You want to know in which conditions your AE
damage spells can bring you higher (or more specific) rewards than
your DD spells (maybe never).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">So, the assessment criteria are basically a
ratio of certain stats of your AE spells versus certain stats of your
DD spells.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You may sometimes want to assess an AE spell
versus another AE spell. I can't cover all cases, but some are worth
a review (for instance, Al'Kabor spells versus lower-rank Columns;
Wizard PB spells versus the PB spells of other classes).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">DD spells chosen as
reference for assessing AE versus DD (see table below)</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Instead of "versus DD", I will often say say
"versus Shock", because the Shock spell line is the only genuine,
almost-continuous and drawback-free DD spell line (Bolts and
all-or-nothing Shocks are scattered in the spell book, and are not
genuine drawback-free DD). Problems arise at some levels where the
reference is unclear, so, one DD spell will be the main reference,
and the other DD spell will be a "backup" reference:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Level 20: the only available DD (Force Shock)
is an all-or-nothing Shock (an unreliable, non-chain-castable spell,
with swollen stats, which is not a sound reference). But this
disturbs the assessment of only one AE spell (Fire Spiral of
Al'Kabor), and doesn't even disturb the assessment much. The level 16
Flame Shock is the "backup" reference at level 20, mostly for
assessing chain-cast swiftness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Level 49: there are two Shock spells at this
level (Ice Comet and Rend). I choose Ice Comet as the basic
reference, because it is much more famous, and Rend will be used
mostly when Ice Comet fails (spell not yet owned, cold-resistant
mobs). Rend is the "backup" reference at level 49.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Levels 51-59: the only DD upgrade (in
strength) to Ice Comet is the level 60 Sunstrike. In the interval,
Wizards get DD spells (Draughts) which are weaker than Ice Comet, but
tend to enforce new standards of single-cast swiftness and
mana-efficiency (at these levels, Ice Comet tends to recede to niche
applications such as: chain-casting Ice Comet for highest possible
chain-cast swiftness; casting on heat-resistant mobs until the
cold-based Draught is gained; casting on Rooted creatures to limit
the number of times when Root has a chance to break; kill-stealing,
which is normally illegal, but is tolerated in some situations, such
as guild events, when the guild is forcing its way through a dungeon
to reach an objective deeper inside, and doesn't care much for what
happens on the way). So, to assess the level 51-59 AE damage spells,
a double assessment is useful, both versus Ice Comet and versus the
highest-rank available Draught. Ice Comet is an interesting reference
mostly for strength assessment (and chain-cast swiftness assessment,
until the better Draught of Ice is gained), and Draughts are
interesting references mostly for mana-efficiency and single-cast
swiftness assessment. At levels 51-59, I will consider that Draughts
are the main reference (so, unless otherwise stated, the ratios are
versus Draught), and Ice Comet is the "backup" reference. At level
60, the reference is the bigger and better Sunstrike, which needs no
"backup".</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">should</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> generally want to
use your newest, highest-rank spells, which </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">should</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> benefit you more
than your older, lower-rank spells. So, you </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">should</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> prefer to use an AE
spell and a DD spell of the highest rank accessible to you. This
implies that your preferred AE spell and your preferred DD spell
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">should</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> be
of the same rank (the highest !) This is why I am routinely assessing
AE spells versus same-rank DD spells. Beyond level 50, "same-rank"
should be understood as "highest-rank available" (because there isn't
a Draught spell for each spell rank).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But you will not so rarely want to assess an AE
spell versus a DD spell of different rank, for instance if you prefer
to use a lower-rank damage spell for miscellaneous (and often good)
functional reasons, or if you don't own all the damage spells of the
highest rank accessible to you (if you didn't do the right thing). I
can comment only a few typical such cases. Obviously, assessing an AE
spell versus a DD spell of different rank will make you perceive the
AE spell's damage criteria differently, and to a lesser extent also
the mana-efficiency and swiftness criteria.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Using full spell damage in
the calculations</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Spells will not always score full damage. But
it is difficult to state for sure that some types of spells score
full damage (or a high proportion of full damage) more often than
others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I assume that, overall, there is no significant
full-damage-scoring frequency difference between Shocks on the one
hand, and Columns, PB spells and Al'Kabor spells on the other hand
(although there is a suspicion that Al'Kabor is slightly harder to
resist). Given this assumption, the assessment of these three types
of AE spells versus Shock on the basis of full damage is valid.
Exceptions such as Thunderclap and Force Spiral of Al'Kabor (which
are area-effect versions of the all-or-nothing, highly-resisted Force
Shock) do not introduce much discrepancy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rains are different, because they ARE easily
resisted (except Icestrike). I try and take this into account by
considering that a Rain has the routine potential to generate 3 full
hits, not 4, and more attention should be given to the criteria based
on 3 hits than to the criteria based on 4 hits.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Using starting damage in the
calculations</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Starting damage" is rather self-explanatory:
it is the full damage which a spell does when you barely have access
to the spell rank. When you later gain levels, the spell's full
damage improves a bit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An AE spell is normally used as soon as it
becomes accessible, and during some levels thereafter: until another,
better, AE spell of the same line is gained; or until the reference
Shock changes, and the new Shock is so interesting that the AE spell
doesn't keep up; or until another, better, AE spell of a different
line is gained (but, the mechanics of the different spell lines being
different, it is potentially difficult to switch). Some AE spells
will have a longer lifespan than others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I use the starting damage of spells in my
synthetic tables, because the starting damage is a fairly undisputed
figure. But I have made calculations with later damage and maxed
damage; the difference is usually very small (less than 0.5%
variation in the ratios), and I mention later damage only when it has
a particular importance (such as changing the ratios significantly,
for instance in the case of Rains).</FONT></P>
