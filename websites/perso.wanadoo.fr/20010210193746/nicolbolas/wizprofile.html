<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This text is primarily meant to help beginning
Wizards decide if they want to pursue, assuming they have doubts.
Wizards have the most extreme strengths and frailties, and are either
very pleasant to play or very frustrating depending on player
temperament. Read this before investing much time in your Wizard !
The text is organized around four common misconceptions:
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Wizards are weak at low
level and powerful at high level</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">";
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">the direct damage of
Wizards doesn't shine that much</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">";
"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Wizards can't
solo</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">"; and "</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#AF0000">playing a Wizard is boring</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">".</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">1) "Wizards are weak at low
level and powerful at high level"</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Yes and no. "Low level" is to be understood as
levels 1-11 only. As a true newbie Wizard (that is, without the good
mastery of game commands and deluxe equipment which a "twinked"
newbie has), you will have a terrible time dying and getting lost
repeatedly, at least up to level 5 or 6 (my own piece of advice:
spend immediately 3 practice points in Piercing instead of magical
skills; buy a Giant Snake Fang from another player for 6 gold; learn
how to use the /loc command, and don't forget to program a /loc
button and hit it before you die). Experiment with the newbie AE
spells, they're actually good for their level (Numbing Cold 1,
Icestrike 4, and Column of Frost 8).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At levels 7-11, you have enough mana to start
"Root bombing" (blasting mobs while they are Rooted), and you can
afford better gear (provided that you refrain from buying immediately
all the level 8 spells, which are quite expensive), so you improve
rapidly. Also, nowadays, newbies playing in Nektulos or East Commons
(or Queynos Hills) make huge money out of High quality bear skins,
sold to tailor players for 30 platinum each (that kind of money was
unknown in my youth; by the way, I buy the skins, if you ever meet
me).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At level 12, you learn the Shock of Lightning
spell, and you reach your full direct damage potential. This is (for
its level) one of the brightest direct damage spells you ever get
(other levels at which you jump significantly forward are 24, 44 and
49). There's also the great comfort of Bind, of course. Try again the
level 8 Shadow Step: it has improved since you first gained it, and
becomes an effective means of evasion outdoors. Your best investment
at these levels is still a good weapon (preferably Dragoon Dirk, or a
Runed Totem Staff while you wait, or a Water Crystal Staff for the
fun of it).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The next improvements are more discreet, more
defensive and commodity-oriented: at level 16 you gain Leatherskin
(very important damage-absorbing blanket), Invisibility, Heat Sight
(infravision), Bind Sight (good scouting spell), and, at level 20,
Tishan's Clash (stun, basically a spell meant to give your fighters a
break), together with your first self-only Teleports.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Levels 20-23 are a trial, as far as offense is
concerned, because the level 20 direct damage spell is not so good
(Force Shock is big, but super-expensive and unreliable; it has more
chances of being useful for spell interruption later in your career).
Also, this is the time when you start having trouble complementing
your magical damage with your melee capabilities (your melee
performance becomes ridiculous as creatures grow tougher, and you
will want to meditate when not casting, to reduce downtime; it took
me much time to accept that). Also, at this stage, levelling up
starts getting much slower. The best thing which can happen to you in
your 20s is to gain a Solist's Icy Wand, which, although not a
"weapon", performs as a monstrous upgrade to any kind of weapon you
have known before. This item being very expensive in trade, you might
as well choose Kurn's Tower (in Field of Bone, Kunark) as your
adventuring target, as soon as you can Bind yourself there and
Teleport back to your home base for shopping; maybe you will find a
Wand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At level 24, you're back at the peak of your
firepower. The level 24 direct damage spell is good (a bit smaller
than Force Shock at first, but reliable), and you have a good AE
damage spell (Column of Lightning). You've also got all your
self-only Teleports, and Levitate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At level 29, the true golden years begin. You
gain a lot of flexibility and independence with Bonds of Force
(area-effect Snare), and you gain your first Portals (group
Teleports). While you may focus on gaining any kind of equipment at
these levels, I advise to make the Staff of Temperate Flux a
priority: this is the brilliant tool with which you can become an
artist at manipulating the mobs' hate in the best interest of your
group. At level 34, while your direct damage seems to improve
normally, you regain AE damage capability in the form of Circle of
Force and Thunderclap (which is the most potent AE damage spell in
the game, for its level), and you also gain Harvest (self-only mana
boost).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I can't really comment on higher levels, but it
seems that the choice of new spells beside direct damage gets
markedly poorer from level 39 on (also, the AE damage spells are
bad). The only spells looking somewhat exciting are the hate-reducing
Concussion at level 39 (obtained through a hard quest), which brings
the final touch to your distinctive art of manipulating mob hate, and
the level 44 Gravity Flux (an AE damage spell which seems rather
inefficient, but is fun, and can serve as a short self-only
mega-Levitate, such as a "6 million dollar man" jump spell, with the
added cost of taking damage). You gain a superb direct damage spell
at level 44 (but don't mind your Magician neighbour, who gets almost
the same). You become someone important socially at level 46, as the
exclusive gatekeeper of the Planes of Hate and of Sky - in addition
to being allowed access to the Plane of Fear as everybody else is.
The fabled level 49 Ice Comet brings truly unequalled firepower, but
there isn't much more in the level 49 spells except the clumsily
spectacular Super Nova (big AE damage spell with awful damage/mana).
It's possible that, at high level, some of your most valued
intermediate-level tactics become too risky to be worthwile, as the
mobs become able to kill you in a much shorter time than before, if
you fall within their reach. Some high-level mobs even have the
distasteful habit of "summoning" you when you tease them too much:
they say "You won't evade me XXX", and, pop, you're teleported near
them and they tear you to shreds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Beyond level 50 is another matter. Verant had
the dubious idea of introducing direct damage spells (Draughts)
smaller and "swifter" than Ice Comet, instead of classic upgrades (in
reality, from level 51 to 56 included, these "swift" Draughts inflict
damage less swiftly than Ice Comet in chain-casting). The Lures,
"almost irresistible" direct damage spells with not-too-bad stats,
might be the true novelty. The upgrade to Ice Comet (Sunstrike) comes
only at level 60. The post-50 AE damage spells are numerous and
hugely boosted versus the pre-50 AE spells. I believe that Verant
agreed to let us be masters of AE damage post-50, when they designed
the post-50 spells, but they don't want to revamp the very-uneven
pre-50 AE for some reason (probably the "don't disturb a gameplay
balance which seems fine as it is" kind of thinking). There isn't any
new funny concept, except the level 59 Flaming Sword of Xuzl (a
temporary low-hit-point "pet" of dubious practical value), and the
level 60 Disintegrate (which provides a chance to </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">destroy</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> a mob, leaving no
corpse and with no experience gain !) The main issue with post-50
gaming might be that, in your early 50s, you are temporarily
extremely powerful against mobs in their high 40s, but weaker and
weaker afterwards when fighting level 51+ mobs, the hit points of
which tend to rocket beyond what your mana supply allows you to kill
(just as your melee weapons become useless in your early 20s, your
spells possibly become useless in your mid-50s...) But this is yet
unconfirmed, and might be one more manifestation of the usual
whining.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To summarize: at any rate, don't look up
dreaming to the level 49 Ice Comet spell. There's a rich life in the
intermediate levels, and you can start having a taste of it as early
as in your teens. Especially, if you play a Wizard of level 12 or
higher and you're not satisfied with your offensive powers, learn to
like them, or quit playing your Wizard, because your offense won't
get better (only your defense and commodity spells will
improve).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">2) "The direct damage of
Wizards doesn't shine that much"</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Yes and no. Many Wizards believe that they
should be able to outdamage anybody over the course of a fight; they
complain that the Magicians' direct damage is almost as effective,
and that all casters with pets outdamage Wizards easily. But Wizards
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">are</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> the
masters of direct damage - the expression just doesn't have the
meaning some want it to have. The comments below include a comparison
with the Magician, and are for pre-50 (a few comments on post-50
issues are included in the previous section). Some comments on
Wizards versus melee classes are in the 4th section.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Spell
availability</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">: Wizards get at least one
genuine drawback-free DD spell per spell rank (except level 20, at
which they inherit the dubious Force Shock: a big, swollen,
unreliable, non-chain-castable, all-or-nothing spell, with a
split-second stun which interrupts the spellcasting of mobs). The
Bolts (which Wizards get at level 1, 8 and 16) are false DD (with a
few specific advantages and mostly drawbacks), but come in addition
to the genuine DD. The Wizard firepower also has an even progression
in size, although the biggest jumps forward are achieved roughly at
levels 12, 24, 44 and 49. On the contrary, Magicians get uneven DD
depending on level. They get genuine (and quite decent) drawback-free
DD at levels 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, 34 and 44. They get Bolts only (false
DD) at levels 20 and 49. They don't get </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">any</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> DD at levels 12, 29
and 39.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a result, the damage of the Magician's
newest (genuine) DD spell fluctuates between 43% and 96% of the
Wizard's, depending on whether the spell is real new or already old.
The damage/mana of Magicians is more constant: between 86% and 96% of
the damage/mana of Wizards. So, the point is not </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">how much </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">damage Magicians
and Wizards can generate over time, burning their mana supply; the
point is rather how quickly and effectively the damage is
homed.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Swiftness</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: the distinctive skill of Wizards is the ability to
throw in damage quickly on demand, either with a single cast, or by
means of chain-casting fast and large damage spells over the course
of one or two dozen seconds; so we were told, and so it is. Wizards
will not so often want to chain-cast more than 2 or 3 spells, because
it consumes a lot of mana, and it may not always kill creatures
quickly enough to prevent deadly retaliation; but they can do it. The
single-cast swiftness (damage / cast time) is a basic measure of DD
spell versatility, and Magicians fluctuate between 45% and 86% of the
Wizards' single-cast swiftness (their cast time is slightly longer).
The chain-cast swiftness (damage / "cast + recast time") is a measure
of continuous damage output speed tendency, an indicator of what
happens if you decide to go berserk. Assuming the recast time is a
standard 2.2 seconds for both casters, Magicians fluctuate between
45% and 89% of the Wizards' chain-cast swiftness (note that the
lowest of these Magician swiftness figures are for low-level and for
high-level; between levels 16 and 48, the swiftness is fair).</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"
COLOR="#AF0000">Specialization</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">: all the
DD spells of a Wizard are Evocation, whereas the DD spells of a
Magician are shared between Evocation and Conjuration (and a Magician
will normally specialize primarily in Conjuration). The level 20, 24,
34 and 49 Magician DD spells are Evocation; the absence of mana cost
bonus and concentration-regaining bonus must be noticeable at level
34, and quite important at level 49.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Energy type</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Wizards have a regular rotation of energy types (cold,
heat and magic), so, they can always fall back on some not-too-bad
alternate spell, if the first-choice spell encounters a specific
resistance. Magicians have a lower versatility, relying mostly on
heat-based spells; they have, for a change, magic-based DD only at
levels 8, 24 and 44; and they don't have any cold-based
spells.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Resistances</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: at intermediate and higher levels, mobs tend to have a
higher average resistance to spells, and players don't score full
damage from their damage spells as often as before (but this is felt
mostly on the Planes). This was penalizing primarily Wizards, because
DD spells are their sole consistent offense; but, in January 2000,
Verant trimmed the Wizard damage spells so that they are "inherently
less resisted" from level 35 on, and it seems that the fix was
satisfactory, at least up to level 50. Magicians have their own
approach regarding spell resistances: they enjoy debuff spells from
level 24 on (but debuffing takes time and mana). Wizards have a very
small free instant debuff (against heat and cold) from their Staff of
Temperate Flux (when they gain it). The overall differences in
swiftness and average damage scored, taking resistances and debuffs
into account, are hard to assess. Note that Intelligence may play a
role: most casters don't care to increase their Intelligence beyond
200, because the additional mana isn't worth it; but it is rumored
that an Intelligence of around 230 allows the spells to be much less
resisted on places such as the Planes. Wizards get a more marked
advantage regarding resistances, post-50, with their "almost
irresistible" Lure spells.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Resistance
cap</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">: This is a soft cap, not a hard
cap, but, still, players have practically no chance (maybe 5%) to
affect with spells creatures 6-7 levels higher ("deep red" mobs),
whereas it is still possible to hurt them with weapons. As a result,
Wizards are the most shut-off party members when the big mob comes.
The limitation and injustice are serious in theory, but much less
serious in practice (unless the Wizard is markedly junior in the
party), because groups will almost always fight mobs up to light red
only. Take repeated full resistance as a somewhat valuable signal
that the mob may be very tough, and warn your group (they won't
necessarily tell the difference right away between light red and deep
red).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Fixed taunt</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: as a general rule, spells (damage and non-damage) add
a fixed amount of hate on the caster's account in the hate list of
their target, regardless of whether the spell was resisted or not. On
the contrary, weapons annoy mobs on the basis of inflicted damage
only; so, a Wizard will often get pounded down even though his/her
spells did little or no damage, while the fighters are busy elsewhere
or try in vain to use their "taunt" skill (in this case, the direct
damage "shines" the wrong way). The classic mistake (unless
you</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"> intend</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">
to make the mob hate you) is to recast immediately after a fully
resisted spell: the mob didn't count the first spell for
naught.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Blasting
expertise</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">: people will always know what
to expect from an experienced Wizard, but they may not always know
what to expect from a Magician in terms of blasting. Even when they
have a good spell at hand, Magicians may perform as shy blasters
because of their lack of personal defense spells, and they must also
divide their attention between spell combat and pet
management.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Overall "Magician versus
Wizard" blasting performance per level</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">:
this is a guess taking all the above, also the availability of Bolts,
into account.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Levels 1-11: practically equal to
Wizards</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Levels 12-15: much poorer than Wizards (Shock
of Lightning can't be beat)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Levels 16-19: slightly poorer</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Levels 20-23: slightly </FONT><I><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Levels 44-48: practically equal</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Levels 49-50: much poorer (Ice Comet can't be
beat).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">In summary</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">, you may feel that your direct damage shines enough, or
doesn't, both versus melee types and versus other casters. The topic
fuels kilometers of arguing on the forums. But remember that, in the
first months of existence of the game, Wizards acquired a very bad
reputation as kill-stealers, and Verant felt the need, throughout
1999, to adjust the game balance in favor of fighting classes. This
is not to say that Wizards were forgotten in the enhancements; but
they were enhanced in other ways than additional firepower. Also,
Wizards have inherited most of the spellcasting legend of traditional
roleplay (they tend to be thought of as the heirs of the Advanced
Dungeons &amp; Dragons' Magic-User Evocation spells, "the real thing"
if one wants to play a caster), so, I suspect the class is kept
slightly under-attractive in terms of sheer offense, to prevent a
rush and allow the other spellcasters to gain respect. Still, Wizards
often amaze their comrades with their killing speed. A few Wizards
insist that they are so weak that no group could possibly want them,
and this is quite a ridiculous attitude.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">3) "Wizards can't
solo"</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I heard this awful misinformation so many times
in my youth that I believed it for a long time. Although not among
the </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">best</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">
characters for solo play (for that, you need a Druid, a Bard, or a
spellcaster with a pet - this includes Shamen from level 34 on),
Wizards are able to solo effectively, at least </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">much</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> more effectively than
fighters. It's widely advised to solo through the "hell" levels (30,
35, 40 and 45); it's supposed to get you quicker through, but I doubt
it. The main, undisputed drawback of solo play is that you have no
backup in case of trouble (the "unavoidable" trouble being losing
connection; a solo caster with a pet may hope that the pet holds off
the mob long enough to save its master, but a Wizard can't hope
that). Though, I met a Monk-style Wizard having almost exclusively
soloed up to level 30 with </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">no
equipment</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> (only a Senior Apprentice
Robe and a Giant Snake Fang), and happy with his "Wizard power", as
he said.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Root bombing</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is the first consistently successful basic
form of solo play, which you can use as a teenage Wizard, with a bit
of melee between casts (by the way, don't forget to use that
Shieldskin spell at level 16). Root bombing at levels 20-23 is very
hard; but you can try it again at level 24, although it will be more
mana-intensive than in your late teens (because the weapon doesn't
help). It becomes easier again in the 30s and up, because you regain
concentration from hits much more often when using Root to break free
from the mob. At level 29 and after, Root bombing is a fallback
option when you try to "kite" and Bonds of Force fails; you will
never give up Root bombing completely, because it will still serve
you in dungeons, where kiting is impossible.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Guerilla tactics</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is a facilitation of Root bombing. In some
dungeons where there are many players keeping the creatures busy
overall, you can choose a single opponent when you're ready, while
taking advantage of some terrain features. For instance, places with
a body of water (the ditch around Crushbone castle, the lake in
Mistmoore) allow you to blast an opponent on the other side, so the
creature must run around the water to reach you, giving you ample
time to blast again and/or Root. Note that finding a spot from which
you can blast the mobs without them being able to reach you (such a
spot is sometimes found) is considered an exploit and a severe
offense; only commonplace terrain features can be legally taken
advantage of (by the way, the most commonplace terrain feature of
which players legally abuse to avoid defeat is "zoning").</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Kiting</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Wizards may kite outdoors as Druids do, less
safely, but more brutally (no need to wait for the DOT spells to run
their course; the whole kill rarely takes more than 40 seconds). You
can begin kiting before gaining Bonds of Force (at level 29),
provided that you get yourself a Spirit of Wolf (to run faster than
the creature, gain sufficient distance, stop, cast, then run again).
But, the mob being running at normal speed, you don't have that much
time to cast between the moment when the mob comes within Shock range
and the moment when it reaches you. Kiting with the level 29 Bonds of
Force (slowing the mob down) is much more comfortable, and doesn't
require Spirit of Wolf at all (Root or Shadow Step will most often
save you in case of trouble), but Journeyman's Boots add even more
comfort (if only I had them !) Bonds of Force being AE, you will
snare yourself when using it at melee range, so, you have only one
safe attempt (Root bombing or genuine escape are your fallback
options).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The tricky thing when comparing your kiting
capability with that of Druids is the damage/mana of your DD spells
versus their DOT spells, and also your mana supply versus theirs. As
a general rule, you have enough mana to kill blue-conning mobs and
sometimes a white-conning mob, but never a yellow (whereas a Druid
will sometimes boast about kiting yellows or even reds.
Maybe).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Quad kiting</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is the same as above, but on 3 or 4 mobs
at once, with a </FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"><A HREF="aecolumn.html">Column</A></FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"> spell. Druids do it too. The Columns are the only range
AE spells having enough damage/mana to allow killing low-blue mobs
through repeated casting (if you use Al'Kabor spells, the mana runs
out even when trying to kill high-greens). Finding the right
homogeneous low-blue mobs, regrouping them (so that you don't miss
any with the narrow-radius Column), and kiting them to the end,
requires more skill and is more risky than regular kiting;
personally, I believe this is mostly for the pride of it, and the
rewards aren't worth the trouble versus easier forms of solo. Note:
so that the mobs stay grouped, the mobs must all be Snared, or none
of them; and spellcasting mobs which, once in a while, stop for
casting, will never stay grouped. Beware that the level 34 Column is
the last one before level 51. Wizards in their early 50s show
increased interest in quad kiting, because of an excellent
damage/mana of the level 51 Pillar of Frost, versus the hit points of
the high-40s mobs.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Choosing the right
opponent</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There's a lot of trial-and-error in this, of
course. But the idea is that you will not necessarily be good at
soloing the same mobs which other players are good at soloing.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Avoid mobs having the bad habit of healing
themselves repeatedly, even high-green (you just can't interrupt
every heal with stun).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Avoid mobs having a lot of hit points and
hitting heavily for their level, especially for Root bombing; they
will exhaust you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Avoid mobs having a known high resistance to
spells, such as Ogre guards or Dark Elf Warriors (and it seems that
all types of crocodiles are particularly resistant to Root).</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Low-blue spellcasting mobs (non-healing) are
often easy prey (for instance Gnoll High Shamen, who had better heal
themselves more often, and Evil Eyes): you won't mind much their weak
spells, while you cast your superior spells (they annoy you more when
they melee you). But beware that some caster mobs "con" below their
real capability (for instance the Stone Skeletons in Lake Rathetear,
or the Goblin Dirtcallers in Frontier Mountains). Opening with Root
on the pet (if any) is usually the best thing to do, unless the
master is low-level enough so that you can kill it with only two
blasts. A cheap trick to get rid of the Rooted greenie pet when its
master is dead: run beyond its tracking range, and the poor pet
realizes it has no purpose, and commits suicide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Venomous mobs (especially spiders) are often
easy prey, because they are usually slow hitters, with few hit
points, and your Skin spell prevents the poisoning while it
holds.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">4) "Playing a Wizard is
boring"</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Many people were told (and believed) that
Wizards were "very good at one thing" (blasting) and nothing more.
Also, Wizards are the most mana-dependent class, so they "meditate
all the time". Doesn't it sound boring ? But any class is boring,
when played passively. I suspect that playing a Wizard has the
potential to be much more exciting than playing a Warrior, a
Magician, or a Cleric, at least up to level 50. Beyond level 50 might
be another matter, but, the game environment being subject to
frequent changes, you shouldn't worry too much about what your
condition might be in a remote future. Overall, Wizards have a
carefully balanced array of gameplay attributes including direct
damage, Teleport, area-effect damage, mob incapacitation, and
prevention/evasion. Not only is Teleport a powerful anti-boredom, but
the versatile offense and defense of Wizards also give them an
interesting multiple nature in combat: magical fighter at one end,
aggressive Cleric at the other end, and taunt-artist Enchanter
inbetween. Wizards can navigate between these roles, to perform best,
depending on mood and circumstances.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Acting as a "magical fighter" is fighting
front-line and continuously to achieve victory, using magical
offensive and defensive powers instead of weapons and armor. A Wizard
performs as a magical fighter at least when playing solo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Acting as an "aggressive Cleric" is being a
support character, focusing on keeping the group healthy (not by
means of healing, but by means of blasting down </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">excess</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> sources of harm,
including the indirect menaces represented by mobs fleeing to call
their friends, and by means of possibly providing the ultimate
evasion of Evacuate), sitting most of the time, and sometimes
standing up to cast (most often at about the same moment when a
Cleric would stand up to cast). This role isn't really passive, but
is discontinuous, and not that much front-line: it's something like
air forces supporting ground forces (supportive bombing, and troop
transportation). This is probably what people mean when they say
"boring", but it's arguable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Acting as a "taunt-artist Enchanter" is a
compromise: being a support character, but in a front-line and
continuous way, putting emphasis on defensive powers consuming little
mana. Whereas Wizards don't have the numerous specialized tools
allowing Enchanters to genuinely shut off mobs, Wizards are very good
at fooling the mobs by means of combining basic incapacitation tools
and an unequalled capacity for aggro control. You might not have
realized that the "taunt" skill of fighters is in reality a defensive
skill (protecting others from harm); learn that Wizards are the best
taunters in town. The "art" is to taunt the mobs unpunished, like a
bullfighter does (I even fancy wearing a provocative fiery red robe,
although the stats are poor for my level; I doubt that the mobs make
a difference, but I like it, and it gives me the right
mindset).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Obviously, participating front-line and
continuously in fights is more exciting than sitting behind as
support and backup; being magical fighters is what Wizards sign for
when they begin their career. But there's a tendency to shift towards
being a support character as level improves. It's a double challenge
for Wizards, as they grow older, to invent new exciting ways of
fighting (when the older ways lose their breath), and to learn to
appreciate being a support character part of the time, focused on
defense and protection possibly at the cost of some offensive thrill.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Of course, a player who wants to be active as
continuously as possible without investing much in improving his/her
playing style should play a fighter, and a player who needs a
plentiful array of spells to be happy should choose a Necromancer,
Enchanter or Druid. But the diversity of Wizard spells is more than
decent enough to fill the eight memorization slots, and the combat
choices of a Wizard are stimulating (check my </FONT><FONT
