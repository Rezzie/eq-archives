<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#AF0000">A) Purpose
of this site</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I chose a Wizard instead of another
spellcaster, because I wanted to be free as the wind (teleporting at
whim, instead of dragging the burden of a pet behind me); because I
thought that having the "best" direct damage was the real thing; and
because I viewed AE damage spells as thrilling and spectacular
(remember the AD&amp;D Fireball ?) Now, after a year and a half of
playing (and still being intermediate-level), I lost most of my
initial interest in AE damage, to focus on other aspects of play.
This happened because, on the whole, AE damage is very unbalanced. A
handful of AE damage spells are on the verge of being overpowered
(Column spells from level 24 on, PB spells from level 34 on, Rain
spells from level 53 on), while most of the others are very weak.
Most overpowered spells also need a special preparation and mindset
to be fully taken advantage of, and I don't have that mindset, being
rather fond of casual, flexible tactics. AE damage spells (except
Columns, and the post-50 Rains) don't have much place in casual,
flexible tactics. I tried some heavy lobbying in summer 2000, so that
the power of AE damage versus DD would be made more even, but to no
avail. However, I strive to keep this guide updated, because the
topic deserves it. I am still interested in devising the brightest
possible assessment criteria for AE damage spells, criteria capable
of teaching us something about the game. A concept which I also try
and defend at all times is: no positive or negative comment is valid
for all AE damage spells; to be valid, a comment must make a
difference between the four main AE damage spell lines (Column,
Al'Kabor, Rain, PB), or at least be explicitly limited to one spell
or spell line. Some Wizards speak of "AE spells", either in good or
in bad, actually thinking of this or that particular spell line (or
spell); I hate that. By the way, if you want to know my overall ideas
about the Wizard class, see my other essay on </FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"><A HREF="wizprofile.html">Wizards: profile and
misconceptions</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#AF0000">B) The
third main gameplay attribute of Wizards ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The idea here is to weigh the importance of the
various gameplay attributes, and determine how important AE damage is
to Wizards, and how important it should be. Wizards have many
abilities, and many of them underestimated, especially the defensive
abilities: Wizards have brilliant defenses, either active (mob
incapacitation) or passive (harm prevention / evasion). Although
Wizards don't have the inherent personal defenses which fighters have
(hit points, armor), they have, in reality, defenses which routinely
allow them to kill mobs single-handed without taking any damage, and
to markedly reduce the losses suffered by a group. Note that some
defensive "abilities" of Wizards are specific spells, while some
others are side effects or specific tactical uses of spells
pertaining to another gameplay attribute (DD, Teleport and AE
damage).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">DD</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: direct damage is undisputedly the prime gameplay
attribute of Wizards, the distinctive offense of which they are
"masters", and this doesn't need much discussion. If you believe that
the best defense is offense, then, DD is also defense in addition to
offense (if only because it is range offense), and the defensive
potential of DD counts in assessing the importance of DD as a
gameplay attribute. Although some complaints are often heard about
Wizard DD, it is generally considered as efficient and
satisfactory.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Teleport</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Teleport is something very exclusive, shared only
between Druids and Wizards (although all spellcasting classes have
Gate, and Necromancers also have short-range random Teleport which is
passive defense). It comes naturally after DD, as the second most
important gameplay attribute of Wizards. Teleport adds a lot to
playing fun, allowing to join friends and change environment easily,
as well as being a help for questing. There is a part of passive
defense (personal and collective) in Teleport (although, in my
experience, Evacuate is less useful than it may seem at first: groups
feel safer when you memorize it, but they almost always prefer that
you refrain from using it). Wizard Teleport may be seen as slightly
superior to Druid Teleport, because it includes Teleport to the
Planes, and some side spells related to the theme.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Mob incapacitation (active
defense)</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">: "mob incapacitation" is
defined as all means to affect mobs so that they can't cause harm to
you and/or your allies ("all means" short of immediate death, which
is a plain application of DD or AE damage). "Mob incapacitation" is
offense by nature (because you are doing something to the mobs), but
it is defense by destination (the outcome is that some harm is
avoided). The champion of mob incapacitation is the Enchanter, but
Wizards deal in several ways to incapacitate mobs, mostly:
movement-hampering, stun, and aggro control. Wizards don't have, for
instance: Charm, Fear, Harmony, Mesmerize (defined as a very long
stun which is broken if the mob takes damage), and pets (which, in
addition to being continuous damage sources, perform as defensive
lures keeping mobs busy, i.e. preventing the mobs from attacking
players). Details in the </FONT><FONT

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Prevention / evasion
(passive defense)</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">: "prevention /
evasion" spells are pure defense: they don't </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">do</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> anything to any mobs,
but, still, their outcome is that some harm is avoided. "Prevention /
evasion" spells are many, and some of them are exciting (for instance
Skin spells and Yonder). Details in the </FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"><A HREF="wizdefense.html">Defensive abilities
sub-page</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">AE damage</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: AE damage hardly needs a definition: it is a class of
spells allowing to damage more than one mob at once, in a certain
area. The basic AE damage spells are called Columns. There are 3 main
other lines of spells which have a lesser overall damaging
performance than Columns (and have some specific drawbacks), but have
a distinctive advantage each: Rains can stack up to 3 hits on the
same mob, for greater strength (but this can be done on only one mob,
and becomes valuable only post-50); PB spells can affect
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">any</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> number
of mobs (but they are risky zero-range, and the line is very uneven);
and Al'Kabor spells have a wide radius (they got the crappiest
"advantage" of all, it's worthless). There are also a few scattered
spells, with specific side benefits (such as a moderately long stun
for the level 54 Thunderbold), which don't fit in these lines.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">How important should AE damage be to Wizards ?
There are strong indications that it should be quite important.
Wizards are often seen as the heirs of Advanced Dungeons &amp;
Dragon's Evocation magic, the most famous spells of which are the AE
spells such as Fireball and Lightning Bolt. The content of our spell
book looks like a confirmation: 22 AE damage spells pre-50, and quite
some more post-50; that's a lot (other classes having access to AE
damage own about 3 times less spells). Also, AE damage is the only
obvious and consistent way in which Wizards can challenge their
damage/mana ratio (other spellcasters, including healers, improve it
with pets, DOT, or weapons). Should Wizards be the only character
class stuck with an immutable ratio, because it is supposedly the
"best" ? It might be a false rumor, but I heard that Geoffrey Zatkin
once stated that AE damage was the "pet" of Wizards. One could expect
Wizards to use AE damage often, in the same way Magicians are often
seen in the company of a pet; AE damage </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">should</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> be the third
gameplay attribute of Wizards, after DD and Teleport. Let's not
forget, however, our non-"spellcasting" cousins the Bards, who may
accumulate, in their own way, a lot of experience about the strengths
and weaknesses of AE effects (many of their songs operate like our
"PB" spells).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In practice ? Let's face it: miscellaneous
active and passive defense is immensely more useful to Wizards than
AE damage, on a daily basis. A Wizard can lead a successful career up
to level 50 without ever playing an AE damage spell, and, only from
level 52 on, may be "forced" to use Rains; not so with defense
spells, without which Wizards would live a very miserable life in the
intermediate levels.</FONT></P>

"Mastery" of AE damage</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">The amazing
Wizard</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Most other classes will be amazed by the
Wizard's speed when killing a mob single-handed (if able at all). A
multiple kill is even more amazing, but much harder to score, except
on very small greenies, so, a lonely Wizard is more likely to amaze
newbies than to amaze players of equal level with AE damage spells.
It is possible to amaze players of equal level in a group, when
skillfully creating an impression of "could never have been done with
direct damage" by using the right AE spells at the right time, with
maximum effects, calculated exposure, and minimum mess (good luck !)
AE damage spells can be viewed as the second way for Wizards to go
berserk (the first way being chain-casting DDs).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also, the visual EFX of AE spells are sometimes
greater and more impressive than the EFX of direct damage. Many
character classes can't generate much EFX, and will count on Wizards,
more than on any other spellcaster, to provide the awesome
fireworks.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Mastery versus other
classes</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If "mastery" of AE damage means the same as
"mastery" of DD, then, Wizards should have at least one good AE
damage spell per spell rank. But it is not true: there is a good
Wizard AE damage spell available approximately every second spell
rank, at least pre-50; the "mastery" versus other classes seems to
improve post-50. Pre-50, Wizards can be seen as "masters" of AE
damage only by default, if you view AE damage as generally weak and
unreliable in the game, Wizards being the only class having many such
spells, less lousy than average, with a few of them good or even
powerful. Now, you may find that default mastery disappointing or
encouraging. Here is a list of the </FONT><B><I><FONT

damage spells, you are using a relatively non-focused (or diluted)
tool, affecting indifferently all the mobs in the area, and affecting
each of them less than DD would, so, you are giving up most of your
ability to choose which mob you want dead first. Also, you are
unleashing something relatively unpredictable, which is likely to
backfire in some way or another. Typically, one or more mobs will
turn on you - maybe you intended to achieve that result, but, if you
end up more distracted or threatened than you wanted, this is your
group's problem as well as yours. In short, you'd better make sure
that you are repaid for giving up the reliable and proven DD. Now,
your ambition may vary, and you may be content with moderate rewards,
or exclusively with high payoff.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">While many Wizards don't believe that AE damage
spells are any good, some intermediate-level and high-level Wizards
derive special pride from having mastered the use of certain AE
damage spells for consistent benefits. There's even a pair of
possibly-abusive applications of the best AE damage spells, which you
will find in the description of Columns and PB spells. Also, at level
52 and beyond, mastering Rains is essential. I hope that this site
will, if not make AE damage spells more popular, at least encourage a
few more Wizards to test themselves against this insolent
magic.</FONT></P>
