<P><FONT FACE="Arial">These spells, obscurely called "PB" for
"player-based" or "point-blank", are unique in several ways. First,
they are the only non-targeted, zero-range damage spells which
Wizards have: whatever the Wizard's current target is, mobs are
affected in a comfortable radius </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">around</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> the Wizard (beware:
although PB spells are often said to affect mobs "at melee range",
they don't have a </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">range</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Arial">, they only have a radius). The Wizard is not damaged by
the spell, but should be prepared for immediate mob retaliation (PB
spells refresh our memory about how safe it is to attack from a
range). Second, PB spells are the only damage spells able to affect
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">any</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> number
of mobs (and this allows maybe-abusive tactics which have no special
name, but which I will call "PB gang bang" or "PB death camp" here,
see below). PB spells have very variable stats (mana cost, damage and
cast time) for their level. The recast time is moderately long (6
seconds), except for the level 34, 49 and 60 spells which have long
recast time (12 seconds). With the exception of the level 34
Thunderclap, the resistance pattern seems standard, similar to that
of Shocks; Thunderclap is all-or-nothing and highly resisted (like
Force Shock), but, in spite of this drawback, it is still the
brightest spell in the line, thanks to very nicely swollen stats -
however, its use is best limited to low-blue mobs, or the resistance
factor spoils the fun. The PB spells of level 24, 34, (and probably)
53, 56 and 59 generate a pushback effect of varying nature which may
interrupt spellcasting (especially Thunderclap, which pushes like
Force Shock does, with split-second stun interrupting spells for
sure).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Visual EFX</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Most PB spells create the same visual EFX as
Columns, that is, lasting vertical blue or orange flames around each
affected mob, which are a heavy trial for the graphic cards. However,
at least the level 34 Thunderclap has a different and much lighter
EFX: brief red sparks somewhat similar to the EFX of Shock of
Lightning. Whenever PB spells are about to be used intensively, it's
much advised to shut particle density off.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Critic</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I initially perceived PB spells as utterly
exciting: the Wizard's revenge in melee, here comes the berserker
Wizard ! However, after taking many blows trying to use PB spells as
short-range offense or self-defense, I came to think that they were
not quite powerful enough in casual play to justify such an exposure.
Speaking of self-defense: Root, or some other non-damage defensive
tool, will serve you much better when you're attacked by multiple
mobs. But PB spells are to be appreciated differently, depending on
intended use and inherent performance. In casual play, when your
ambition is to affect a small handful of mobs for the fun of it, you
want a PB spell with good inherent performance. In "PB gang bang"
tactics, the inherent performance of each spell is less important:
you want to rotate two or three PB spells, with an overall damage
concentration just sufficient to kill the mobs before mana runs
out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The PB spell line is the most uneven AE damage
spell line in terms of inherent performance. Some PB spells are
swift, others clumsy; some are weak, others strong; some do
concentrated damage, others diluted damage. The level 34 Thunderclap
is probably the most brilliant of all pre-50 AE damage spells; the
post-50 Jyll's spells are lightweight, but offer much for the cost ;
the strongest spells (Super Nova, Winds of Gelid) are clumsy and have
awful damage/mana, but may compensate just because they're big; and
most other PB spells are simply unattractive packages, good only for
being played in a rotation with better spells.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">People seem to have trouble finding the
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Rune of Conception</FONT></I><FONT

have looted this Rune a few times in City of Mist, near the zone, off

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Damage/mana gambling: when hesitating between
memorizing a Column and memorizing a PB spell, besides comparing
stats, consider that PB spells represent a greater personal exposure,
but allow you to choose more precisely the center of the affected
area (that's where you stand), giving you a greater chance to hit all
the intended mobs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Rotating PB spells and Columns: at levels 8,
16, 24 and 34, you have both a new Column and a new PB spell
available, with roughly comparable stats. Even if the PB spell alone
would not be attractive, memorizing both spells can allow you (in
group, and in melee) a quasi-chain-casting of 2 or 3 reasonably
strong AE damage spells, for more spectacular results. Even without a
special group organization, you might occasionally be able to play
the hero that way and survive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Interrupting caster mobs: the
spell-interrupting pushback provided by Cast Force, Thunderclap and
the Jyll's spells has some value, because the spells are quick and
cheap (whereas the Al'Kabor spells with the same effect are slow and
expensive).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- One big shot: Super Nova and Winds of Gelid
may allow impressive brutal finish-offs, consuming huge mana.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Help finish the main mob, while starting to
proceed with the next: the risk of retaliation from the additional
mobs is higher than when you use a Column for the same
purpose.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- PB carnival: at some levels (especially 24),
many casters and healers gain access to a PB spell. A group having
several spellcasters can agree to pull multiple mobs, and fire PB
spells at will (shut particle density off !) The result will most
probably be a mess, but can be efficient and funny enough. Other
types of AE damage spells can be added, but PB spells are the most
capable of hitting all the nearby mobs in a messy fight. Enchanters
can help effectively by casting PB stun spells. This is a casual
version of "PB gang bang".</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Helping lower-level players with trains: the
PB spells being non-targeted, and able to affect any number of mobs,
they are particularly suited for helping lower-level players in
dungeons, with minimal effort: no skillful targeting needed, just
stand near the zone and press the button once when the train comes.
You must select the right-sized spell, maiming mobs without stealing
the kills; or select a bigger spell almost killing the mobs, and zone
after you cast it.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Advanced tactics: "PB gang
bang"</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Wy kill one mob with your mana supply, when you
can kill twelve of them ? You need a specially composed and trained
group (at least mid-thirties). The tactics are as follows: one buffed
Warrior goes pulling a train of 10-12 blue mobs back to one or two
Wizards who start rotating PB spells. The Wizards are protected by
one or two Enchanters rotating PB stun spells (and possibly giving
Rune buffs), and by one or two Clerics healing and (if available)
giving invulnerability buffs. The fighters (and pets, if any) take
care of the runners. The Wizard Sabbok describes "the core components
of any 'pure' AE group" as "2 Wizards, 1 Enchanter, 1 Cleric; the
other two spots can be filled by just about anyone, but preferably a
tank and a high-damage meleer (rogue, ranger or monk)". A regular
group using these tactics can gain lots of experience, and Verant
doesn't seem to view it as abuse, as long as only a tiny minority of
players get organized that way. Provoking that many mobs at once is
daring after all (some Wizards sweat and whine when caught in melee
with one blue mob: imagine twelve of them beating at you while you
try to concentrate), and I don't want to imagine what happens when
more than one party member goes linkdead. My knowledge of this is
second-hand, because my regular group is not suited, and I don't care
to create another group specially for that purpose. My last attempt
to rotate Thunderclap and Cast Force, in the company of an Enchanter
of insufficient level, was horrendous.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Requested
improvements</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The PB spell line is so uneven that the worst
spells would deserve a revamp. Especially, the spells of level 8 to
24 are mediocre. But, the PB spells' potential for very-high-gain
tactics being a kind of threat to gameplay balance, it's probably
hopeless to claim "justice" for some of the spells of that line. PB
spells are not the spells most in need of a fix - if a change comes
one of these days, it is more likely to be a nerf, in the form of a
mob count limitation.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">PB spells of other
classes</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(To be completed). In short, the non-Wizard
class having the greatest number of PB spells is the Cleric, in the
form of two spell lines, the "earth-shaking" line shared with the
Druid, and the "Word" line shared with the Necromancer; most of these
spells are very clumsy. Magicians also have some weaker versions of
Wizard PB. Although non-Wizards can also deal virtually infinite
damage with PB, it seems in practice that the best Wizard PB spells
have a consistent edge.</FONT></P>
