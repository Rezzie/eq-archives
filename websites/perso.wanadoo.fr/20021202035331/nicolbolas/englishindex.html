<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Hello, I have been playing on the Karana server
since May 1999, and my name is Nicolbolas Whizz &lt;</FONT><FONT

FACE="Arial">&gt;. I am still only level 58, because I spend so much
time on tailoring (193 skill now). I am French, I am a low-powered
executive in a subsidiary of a US corporation, and I prepare an essay
(unrelated to my work) for which I hope to gain some notoriety IRL.
But that's for later. I'm sorry I didn't update this site for ages,
but I put a lot of effort in it initially, and I believe it still has
good residual value, for beginning Wizards and also some advanced
Wizards interested in Area-Effect spells.</FONT></P>
