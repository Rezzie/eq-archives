<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rains are among the most complex of all damage
spells. They are targeted range spells generating 4 "hits" or packets
of damage, some (or all) of them dealt immediately, and some possibly
delayed (or lost), distributed among up to 4 mobs in a comfortable
radius around the target. There are 3 "waves" of hits at intervals of
3 seconds, so, if there are less than 4 mobs in the affected area, 2
or 3 hits may end up stacked on the same mob. The 2nd and 3rd waves
are centered on the same spot than the 1st wave, not on the target
mob, so, the mobs may move out of the area (for instance, in order to
attack you) before the next wave(s) can hit them. You will often hurt
yourself with the spell at short range, but the hits inflicted to you
don't count in the 4-hit limit. More broadly, when players are
affected by a Rain (cast by a mob, or by another player in PvP, or
when a player is affected by his/her own Rain), each and every
affected player can sustain up to 3 hits. But this is a general rule
for AE spells, which doesn't reflect how the spells are supposed to
perform when used by players on mobs: the spells are capable of
affecting a </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">limited</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Arial"> number of mobs plus an </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">unlimited</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> number of
players.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Th second most stringent limitation, and the
hardest to figure out (I didn't figure it out by myself - I got a
hint on a forum in early 2001 and tested it out), is the resistance
pattern, which depends on the affected mobs' current hit points. A
near-full-life mob has a fair chance to be affected by the Rain, or
at least to be affected by the first hit. But, the lowest the mob is
on life, the harder it resists, to the point when a mob with only a
sliver of life remaining will have a 100% resistance to Rain hits.
Rain spells are completely unable to finish off a mob, and are
therefore best used in the early fight (when used in mid-fight, a
resistance to roughly half the hits is to be expected. Note that
Rains are not quite all-or-nothing, but partial resistance to a hit
is very rare; on the average, unless used super-early in the fight,
only 3 hits out of 4 are scored on blue mobs, or 2,25 hits out of 3,
when the spell is used on a single mob). This severe resistance
pattern is inherent to Rains, and can't be overcome, even with
powerful debuffs: high-level Magicians have tried in vain. But I
believe that the resistance has a purpose, which is to prevent Rains
from being too good at replacing DD; they are rather meant as an
early-fight boon, somewhat close to the concept of "takes away a
fraction of the target's hit points" (when the mob is high on life,
the damage may be a large fraction of a mob's hit points; when the
mob is low on life, the damage tends to be moderate or null).</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The cast time is average for an AE spell, but
the recast time is long (12 seconds). The aggro from the Rain is said
to be markedly inferior, for the damage, than the aggro from DD
spells; I believe that this is a general feature of AE spells, but is
felt more with Rains, because the hits can stack on a single mob, and
more meaningful comparisons with DD can be done.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Note: players used to complain about a
so-called "pet bug" (until spring 2001, when it was fixed): if player
pets were present in the affected area, the pets were treated as
mobs, and used to waste some of the 4 hits which were supposed to be
dealt to enemy mobs, even though the pets were immune to the damage;
this was diminishing greatly the potential of the spells. No more so:
Rains now ignore pets (in non-PvP).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is also an old false rumor circulating
about Rains being usable only outdoors (maybe the Druid counterparts
have that kind of limitation).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Visual EFX</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rains create an orange cloud pouring down in
the affected area (they COULD have made a blue version; a green
version exists for the poison Rains of other classes). The EFX is
repeated with the 2nd and 3rd waves. Also, if your character stays
still when the 2nd and 3rd waves occur, he/she repeats the arm-waving

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Fist of all, remember that the spells are for
the early fight only, so they won't really "replace" any other spell,
whether AE or DD. The ability to stack 3 hits on one mob makes Rains
hybrids between AE damage and DD; their efficiency is to be
appreciated completely differently, depending on whether 1, 2, 3 or 4
mobs are affected. Strength and damage concentration also increase
sharply post-50 versus pre-50: whereas the pre-50 Rains are better
left aside (except maybe the level 4 Icestrike), the post-50 Rains
are the </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">favourite</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Arial"> damage spells of many Wizards. When Kunark was
released, and the strong level 52 Tears of Druzzil became available,
some level 52 Wizards who had never considered AE damage started
hearing about it, tried it, and suddenly went shouting throughout
Norrath that AE spells were tremendous (when reminded that the pre-50
Rains are lousy: "don't know, don't care").</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">When used on 1 mob</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Rains are the only AE damage spells which may damage a
single mob more than DD, but, due to their functional limitations,
this is only when you feel safe enough to provoke the mob in the
early fight (sticking to a fighter, or possibly Rooted, but each hit
may break the Root). One potential hit out of 4 is lost, but, if 2 or
3 hits provide enough damage and damage/mana, Rains may be worth
casting. The average number of hits scored being about 2,25 out of 3
on blue mobs, it is better to check also the damage and damage/mana
provided by 2 hits and 2,25 hits, to assess if the Rain is something
more than a loser's gamble. The level 4 Icestrike is somewhat
respectable for sheer strength; but the level 12-44 Rains are bad,
because of insufficient damage and/or insufficient damage/mana (even
if you know how to cope with the resistance pattern). The post-50
Rains are very good, both in damage and damage/mana, even with only 2
hits scored; if the resistance pattern wasn't the way it is, they
would probably be the true upgrades to Ice Comet, with some
functional limitations (Draughts being slow in chain-casting in spite
of being quick in single-cast, and having insufficient damage/mana
when used on high-hit-point post-50 mobs). Many post-50 Wizards like
their Rains so much that they want the functional limitations
inherent to AE spells to be alleviated, claiming that the Rains be
turned into quasi-DOT spells hitting exclusively the selected target
3 times, regardless of the target's environment. I find this claim
inaesthetic (Rains are also meant to be AE spells), and quite
hopeless anyway (I'm sure that Verant is happy with the fact that
Rains are able to replace DD only part of the time; justice or
realism are other matters).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">When used on 2 mobs</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: this achieves the full potential of Rains, with both a
true area-effect dimension and fair potential damage per mob. Pre-50,
the damage and damage/mana are fair if, and only if, none of the 4
hits is fully resisted (about 10% better than a Column used in the
same settings); but scoring 4 positive hits is quite rare, and
scoring only 3 hits is disappointing; post-50, it matters less if
only 2 or 3 hits are scored (even only 2 full hits generate more
damage than Ice Comet).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">When used on 3 mobs</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: this is the weirdest use of Rains, because two of the
mobs get one hit and one of them gets 2 hits (and double aggro), so,
the results in terms of mob behavior can be quite unpredictable (but
see the suggested tactics below). The 2 mobs which get only 1 hit
(possibly resisted) are probably not affected by the Rain in a
worthwile fashion.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">When used on 4 mobs</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: this use is weak, similar to the use of an Al'Kabor
spell, and can't be considered worthwile, even if the 4 hits are
fully scored.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Rewards</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The tactics involving Rains are rather
straightforward, but a few side tactics can be creative.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- The level 4 Icestrike can be used by level
6-7 Wizards in conjunction with Root and Shock of Fire, in order to
take down a mob quicker, even if it's not very mana-efficient.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- The post-50 Rains are used to give a sizeable
damage/mana boost over DD in the early fight, whenever the functional
limitations allow it (possible dispersion of the damage on unwanted
targets), at the price of a memorization slot. Some Wizards underline
the additional reward of creating less aggro than DD, for the
damage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Most pre-50 Rains may be used on EXACTLY 2
blue mobs, without consistent hope of benefit versus DD or Columns,
but </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">maybe</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">
without waste, if the Wizard derives some particular fun from
Rains.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- When used on exactly 3 mobs, Rains will
generate double aggro on one of the mobs, and, if that mob happens to
be one of the additional mobs (not the fighters' main target), there
is a greater chance that this mob (and only that one) will be pulled
away from the fighters, in view of parking it with Root. Columns are
still more likely to cumulate damage/mana and mob control benefits,
though.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- When a strong post-50 Rain is used on a
single mob having a pet, the pet might be killed with a single hit in
the first wave, so that the master mob gets 3 hits (the pet is killed
"for free").</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Requested
improvements</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In summer 2000, I tried to lobby (to no avail)
for the two following improvements for the unattractive pre-50
Rains:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- enlarge the level 12-44 Rains, so that two
hits outdamage the same-rank DD by at least 8-10%,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- give the pre-50 Rains +5% damage/mana, by
means of adjusting the mana cost. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Alternatively, Rains should be able to generate
more hits (at least 6), in order to perform more aesthetically as AE
spells - this could require a downgrade in the damage-per-hit of
post-50 Rains, though, and would probably need much reprogramming; I
don't hope that such a change will be implemented. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Rains of other
classes</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(To be completed). In short, many classes have
Rains, especially Magicians and Druids.</FONT></P>
