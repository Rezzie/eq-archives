<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Everquest's interface is powerful, but takes
some time to master. Here are some disorderly tips which I didn't see
on other sites (or not too often), mostly about the interface and
some specific aspects of magic.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">1) MUNDANE
TIPS</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">"Tomb Raider" playing
view</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To watch your group and your environment
properly, I advise to play a Wizard in "Tomb Raider" view instead of
"Quake" view (Quake view is for fighters getting their kick out
feeling themselves in the heat o battle; they call that "realism"; as
a result, they have no idea of where you are when you need help, and
they don't see the trains coming). Tomb Raider view has the
inconvenience of making mouse-targeting more difficult (you will
often target yourself), but this is hugely offset by the benefit of
wider vision (and of seeing yourself casting the pretty spells). To
get into Tomb Raider view: press F9 twice (you see your own back);
press Home to lock the camera focus on you; use Insert and Delete to
adjust camera distance; use Alt-Uparrow and Alt-Downarrow to adjust
camera height (if you didn't press Home, this gives you a periscopic
effect); use Alt-Pageup and Alt-Pagedown to unlock the camera focus
off you and look up or down; when you have your back to a wall, your
body will tend to become transparent so you can still see in front of
you; in dungeons, your body will tend to obstruct the screen, so you
may want to switch to Quake view, but I still use Tomb Raider view
99% of the time - it is manageable, and it also tends to reveal
secret passages.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Changing money at the
bank</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You are not obliged to abandon large quantities
of small change on the ground or bear their burden. Whenever you are
at the bank, take your coppers and put them in your silver box, then
take your silvers and put them in your gold box, then take your gold
coins and put them in the platinum box, et voil&agrave; ! You are
lightweight again and you have platinum for trade. This works with
the coin boxes of your purse as well as with the coin boxes of your
bank account, as long as you are at the bank.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">The command /loc</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You should program a social button with that
command. For giving appointments, for noting where your body will be
(when you are about to die), and to mark other places of interest to
you, you need /loc. Learn to interpret the figures: the higher the
first figure, the further North you are in the zone. The higher the
second figure, the further West you are in the zone. The point zero
zero is not necessary in the center of the zone (it can be on an
edge). Let's assume that the command gives you a result of 1085.14,
-824.58 and you want to tell a friend where you are: you will tell
your friend "plus1100 minus800 " and this is enough to find you.
About rounding: you can round to the nearest 50 (at least outdoors),
because each 15 of distance is only about the width of a dungeon
corridor. About writing "plus" and "minus" in full letters (or "pos"
and "neg"): the "+" and "-" signs most often don't pass through the
system, and the other player won't get them or will have a doubt.
About leaving a few spaces after the last digits: sometimes the last
letter of a message disappears, and you don't want a zero to
disappear, or the location is wrong by up to a few thousands.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Finding a group member with
/follow</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is useful to program a social button with
/follow for travelling under guidance. But this button can be useful
in combat too. When a group member is in trouble and you can't see
him or her, you may target him or her with PF key, and hit the
/follow button, and, if he or she is not too far away, you will
automatically run to him or her, so you can check what's
happening.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Repeating sentences with
Shift-Uparrow</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Pressing Shift-Uparrow will make you type again
the sentence or command which you last typed (and you can modify it
before validating it with Enter). By pressing repeatedly, you can
scroll back up through the last 19 sentences or commands you have
typed.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Selecting an item from a
stack with Ctrl-Leftclick</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you left-click on a stack of items in your
inventory, a box with a cursor appears to let you select how many you
want to move. To get only one item without the box appearing, you
have to keep Ctrl pressed while you click on the stack. This is
particularly useful when practicing trade skills. Note that, for ANY
combination of ingredients in a container, if the combination
involves two or more similar and stackable items, you must put each
item in a different box of the container, NOT all of them stacked in
one box of the container, or the combination will fail.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Jumping while
running</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is a classical tip, but you might not know
it if you are a newbie. When you are chased, jumping allows you to
gain some ground over the creature chasing you. You lose ground each
time you take a turn, so you should jump once or twice after taking a
turn. Your Stamina will not allow you to jump forever, though.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Spending practice
points</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For some time when I was a newbie, I had the
weird idea that spending practice points in a skill would increase
the skill cap (maximum score you can reach at your level). Not so;
practice points only get you started in a skill. I recommend to spend
3 points before starting a new weapon (spend nothing in the five
basic magical skills). If you seem unable to get your Sense Heading
skill started, you can consider spending a few points in it.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Creatures calling for help
(the mystery of lazy guards unveiled)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When a creature is angry at you (whether
fighting you or fleeing from you), you are inscribed on its "hate
list". If this creature is within the listening range (or "aggro
range", it's the same) of another creature, which is friendly to the
first creature, the second creature will attack you (if it dares),
even if it is friendly to you too (creature friendship is biaised in
favor of other creatures). Who attacked first has no importance. When
you are under attack, nearby creatures friendly to you (especially
guards and merchants) will intervene in your favor if, and only if,
they are programmed to hate your opponent; if they don't care about
your opponent, they will "warmly" look at you dying.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Creature limitations versus
players</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I wrote this as humor ("Top 16 reasons why
EverQuest is unfair to mobs"; an earlier version was published on
</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"><A HREF="http://klaknak.everquest.gamestats.com">The
Cackling Klaknak</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">), but there is some
basis behind in terms of creature behavior. Think of these
limitations, before complaining that creatures can do impossible
things such as: see you through house walls, find you anywhere within
their track range once you caught their attention, stack (many of
them clustering in a space where only one player would fit), get past
any number of bodyguards to come and hit you whenever they feel like
it, hit you from beneath through the floor when they are unable to
find the way up to reach you, have a pet surviving the death of its
master, have several pets including charmed players, have backstab in
addition to attributes of other classes, etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">By the way, "mob" means "mean old bastard"; it
is the same as "NPC" ("non-player character"), but the term is more
combat-oriented.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) Neutral or friendly mobs can't "consider" us
to check if we love them; they can only hope that we will pass
by.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2) Most aggressive mobs don't really attack us
"on sight", or they are as blind as moles (we can remain just outside
their reaction radius, showing them our butt and eating our lunch
unpunished until we are ready to fight, while they stand there
scowling at us and trying to look dignified, and we can cast our
first spell at them comfortably).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">3) Mobs can't perceive players as a group: they
"consider" you to know your level when making combat decisions, but
they seemingly forget to take into account your friends standing next
to you (would you go thinking "great, there is one blue gnoll next to
these five red gnolls, I can attack it safely" ?)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">4) Mobs can't camp us at our home point (unless
we had real bad inspiration when choosing our binding place. Imagine
the mobs sitting at your home point for hours and chatting: "Do you
think he'll spawn soon ? - Wait, /who Dumbo all... He's on Plane of
Fear, first spawn should be soon, and respawn time is very short
after first spawn").</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">5) Mobs don't have Harmony to pull us
one-by-one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">6) Mobs can't kite us (mob would go: "yeah,
Druid, run panting after me while your life is eaten away by
DOT").</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">7) Mobs can't check the Internet for spoilers
and tactics (they could have arguments on mob discussion
forums).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">8) Mobs don't have long-distance communication,
such as group chat and guild chat (they cry for help in a
ridiculously small radius around them, and they can tell their story
over a long distance only by giving us bad faction when they die.
Imagine the Blackburrow gnolls with a chat channel to coordinate
their resistance against us intruders, with the gnoll commander
managing his troops dungeon-wide).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">9) Nobody shouts "train" before six of us
suddenly fall pounding at a single mob.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">10) Mobs can't taunt us away from our
opponent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">11) Mobs can't zone when in danger (leaving us
exhausted, with no exp, walking back to our spot, and having
forgotten about them even if they zone back in).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">12) Mobs can't loot our bodies (did you say
"Ultima Online" ? &lt;shriiieeek&gt;)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">13) Mobs don't gain exp and levels when killing
players (with any luck, a gnoll pup could survive in Blackburrow
several months, and grow big enough to kill higher level players on
their way to Permafrost, then eventually become a mega-death level 54
gnoll equal to Vox or Nagafen - possibly giant size but still with "a
gnoll pup" name tag, or maybe it would have been allowed to choose a
second name at level 20, such as "a gnoll pup Spot").</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">14) Mobs can't plan elaborate large-scale
expeditions into a city to kill a level 50 player rumored to drop
rare and valuable loots.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">15) Mobs can't use cyber-flirt emotes ("a burly
gnoll stares dreamily into a gnoll pup's eyes", "an elite gnoll guard
massages a gnoll commander's shoulders"), get married in the Arena,
get drunk, and duel.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Item availabilty and prices
according to server maturity</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">On a new server with many low level players and
few higher level players, item prices will be high, and players will
basically live with the equipment they can conquer. On a mature
server, there are many intermediate and high level players, and items
conquered by the player community tend to accumulate (even if some of
them are absorbed by the high level players creating "twinked"
newbies to try out other character classes), so prices fall, and some
useful items are even given out to newbies. Conclusion: if you want
Norrath to be yours to take, go to a new server; if crowding doesn't
bother you and you want nice equipment quicker, go to an old
server.</FONT></P>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">2) MAGIC
TIPS</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Casting a spell after
running</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you stop running and start casting a spell
immediately, it is </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial">almost
certain</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> that your spell will be
interrupted. This is probably the effect of routine lag. You should
wait almost one second before starting to cast, even if you are in
dire need. Creatures do not have to wait: they can stop running, cast
their spell, and resume running, without losing a fraction of a
second. I reached level 16 before figuring this out...</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Interrupting your own
spells</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Wrong spell ? Or you think the creature will be
dead before you finish casting ? Press D for "duck", and you spend no
mana (press D again to cancel ducking). Since a 2001 patch, the
casting is interrupted immediately upon ducking.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Virtues of the Staff of
Temperate Flux</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This Staff is Wizard-only, and probably one of
the most useful items a Wizard can have, because it does something
nothing else does. Note that the "Staff of Ro" needed for the quest
is obtained from another NPC in the Temple, who calls it "Darkwood
Staff". You don't need to equip the Staff of Temperate Flux to use
its power, and you can use it while running.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Basically the Staff of Temperate Flux gives
you your own small free instant debuff spell against fire and
cold.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Before casting a long spell (in group play),
if you are unsure that the creature is in your line of sight ("you
can't see your target"), check with the Staff first.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- The Staff's effect has the same range as your
direct damage. If you kite a creature with Bonds of Force, you can
use the Staff repeatedly while running, and, when it tells you that
the creature is out of range, you know it's time to stop and cast. As
Bonds of Force has a short duration, this is a valuable help in
managing your timing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- The Staff can be used repeatedly and has good
taunting power. It won't do good against a creature already mad at
someone else, but, if the creature is hesitating, you can keep it
aggressive against you indefinitely with the Staff without spending
mana. This is interesting especially if the creature is Snared (or
Bonds-of-Forced) so you can escape from it, kiting it around while
the group finishes it off or takes a moment to breathe.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">A failed theory about high
resistance to "magic"</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When I was level 20, I thought I suddenly
understood that cold and heat-based spells would be reliable and
almost always do some damage, while "magic"-based spells would often
be fully resisted because creatures would have, on the average, a
resistance to "magic" higher than their resistance to heat or cold.
Well, at high level it is common to meet creatures with high
resistance to "magic", but not so at intermediate levels: Root,
Tishan's Clash, Force Shock, etc, use "magic" energy, but are highly
resisted essentially because they are designed as "all-or-nothing"
(although one could argue that Root may have "partial" effect through
shorter duration, and becomes more reliable at high level with the
Immobilize upgrade). Other spells such as Shock of Lightning, Cast
Force, etc, are also "magic"-based and are not "all-or-nothing", so
they have regular resistance. By the way, lightning is included in
"magic", not "heat".</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Immunity of gigantic
creatures to stun</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">From level 20 on, you will regularly use stun
spells (Tishan's Clash and its upgrades), because they are nice
spells for the early stages of a fight (they will not annoy creatures
too much, and fighters like to be able to hit at creatures during a
few seconds without retaliation). However, on gigantic creatures such
as giants of all kinds, cyclops, most dragons and gods, the stun is
inefficient. It's not a matter of resistance: the creature will not
necessarily resist your spell (you may get a system message "creature
is stunned"), but will take only the "damage" part of the effect, and
will be stunned during zero seconds only. The system of immunities to
specific spell lines is getting more complex since 2001,
though.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Virtues of skin spells
(Shieldskin, Leatherskin, etc)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Skin spells make you munch costly gems (I carry
a basic stock of 40 peridots), but they are well worth it.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) Basically, the skin spells give you those
precious extra seconds to finish something important, both in a group
(when the time comes to chain-cast and expose yourself, a mere few
seconds of additional survival time allow you to get your share of
the victory) and in solo (in the intermediate levels, you can solo
with Root and Shock most non-Root-resistant blue creatures, if and
only if you buy the time for extra Root attempts with your skin spell
- when the creature is Rooted and your skin spell is gone, refresh
the skin spell before blasting).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2) Skin spells are a diplomatic asset in a
group, and allow you to be brave (hence the expression "skin
tanking"). Most groups will consider that you should even avoid
attracting the creatures' attention on you, and, especially, the
group's healers will not like having to watch over you, unless the
situation is exceptionally hot and the group needs you to chain-cast
spells. However, isn't it boring ? And being attacked is a proof that
you contribute. Skin spells are the perfect solution, acting as
preventive self-heals, allowing you to be reasonably active in
battle, while making you routinely independent from healers. Skillful
use of blast spells and skin spells will show your group that you are
able to manage effectively your offense and your defense, so you may
get away with other things (using AE spells, for instance).</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">3) The skin spell, acting as an alarm signal,
allows you not to care much for your life bar. As long as you get the
"your magical skin absorbs the blow" messages, you don't care at all
for your life bar. As soon as you start taking damage, it's time to
put more emphasis on evasive action. Without this signal, you need to
watch your life bar closely to decide when you are safe and when you
are in danger (the bar moves fast), whereas you want to concentrate
on what you're doing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">4) Even after you stop using weapons, you still
need to melee on a frictional basis, to improve your Defense and
Dodge skills (until they max out, unfortunately). Wearing your skin
spell in group play, you can afford to take blows for a short time,
to improve your defensive skills, without losing noticeable
life.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">5) Skin spells will absorb some forms of
magical damage in addition to melee damage, including the
Shadowknights' Harm Touch, but they will not absorb, for instance,
falling damage, or damage-over-time (once a DOT spell sticks on you,
you start losing life while your skin spell remains in place). As
long as your skin holds, melee hits will not poison you (skin spells
make you even more brave against venomous creatures). But the skin
will not protect you from stunning hits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">6) Beware that refreshing your skin spell in
battle (once your opponent has been taunted away from you) has a huge
taunting effect (the creature is likely to change its mind and come
back for you).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">7) The skin spell reduces your chances of being
interrupted by hits. The spell interruptions are of three kinds: stun
(skin spell doesn't help), red message with immediate interruption (I
don't remember if the skin spell helps), and pushback (movement)
causing interruption at end of casting with blue message (the skin
spell helps because it reduces pushback, and the chance of
interruption depends on movement amplitude).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">8) Remember that, to cast some of their spells,
other spellcasters need the same gems than you do (for instance,
Clerics need them for their symbol spells); so you can give or lend
them some if needed, as well as borrow some from them.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">The level 20 Enstill is not
an upgrade to the level 4 Root</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you're still a teenage Wizard, don't wait
for Enstill with high hopes. Enstill is superior to Root only in
duration, and is less versatile for breaking free from melee because
of a longer cast time; the true upgrade to Root is the level 39
Immobilize.</FONT></P>
