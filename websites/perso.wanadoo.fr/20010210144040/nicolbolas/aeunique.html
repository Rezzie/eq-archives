<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Gravity Flux is a targeted range spell, which
affects a number of creatures of which I am not sure yet (I succeeded
with 5, and I read a long time ago that the number was unlimited) in
a moderately wide radius around the target. The first step is
immediate "magical" damage, and the second step is either
almost-immediate "magical" damage (for mobs) or almost-immediate
falling damage (for players; outdoors, the falling damage may be more
than double the magical damage sustained by mobs). When you cast the
spell on yourself, or on a mob on which you have cast Bind Sight, you
will distinctly see yourself (or the mob) rise rapidly to
above-tree-top height, then fall down, in a very short time (about
one second and a half). When you cast the spell normally on mobs
(without Bind Sight), you will often not be able to see the mobs go
up and down (the movement is too short to be displayed, considering
ordinary lag), and the two damage messages will be almost
simultaneous. In my calculations, I consider that the two damage
steps are as good as simultaneous. Affected mobs and players can move
during the short super-levitation. However, you can't combine Gravity
Flux with Levitate to both jump real high and escape the falling
damage; Gravity Flux will make you bounce upwards only very slightly
if you are Levitating. The cast time and recast time (10-12 seconds)
are long. The spell is all-or-nothing, but the resistance frequency
doesn't seem to be much of a nuisance.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Visual EFX</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is the same as for Levitate, and is only a
light trial for the graphic cards.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Critic</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">My comments are mostly for Gravity Flux, of
which I have first-hand experience, because I doubt that my
information on the upgrade is complete. Gravity Flux is far from
having the same good damaging performance as Columns (although it is
gained at a level at which we could have expected to gain a Column),
but is still way better than the level 39 Al'Kabor spell, doing fair
damage per mob, and giving a symbolic damage/mana bonus for 3 mobs
affected. The level 34 Circle of Force, although weaker (216 damage
versus 314), may still be preferred because of the better damage/mana
per mob (1.23 ratio versus 0.93) and quickness. Gravity Flux being
all-or-nothing is also a drawback. But it is still worth an
occasional use, if only for a change, it is very interesting for
jumping (see below), and the capacity to affect any number of mobs
(unverified) can't be quite neglected, so, it has a potential
overall. The level 59 Invert Gravity, however, looks surprisingly
weak (less damaging than lower-level Columns ? This is why I didn't
bother to calculate the ratios).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Research tip</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The spell was given to me as a present, and I
couldn't check if the alarming rumor regarding Rune of Attraction was
true. Some say that there are two undistinguishable versions of Rune
of Attraction (which do not stack), and that only the Runes found on
high-level mobs can serve to research the spell. This is annoying,
because the other Runes (especially Rune of the Inverse) are
relatively rare, and should not be wasted. I don't believe the rumor
much, because I never found a Rune of Attraction which would not
stack with the others, and there are other cases of a single Rune
serving to research several spells of different levels (for instance
Al'Kabor). It is also said (I have read first-hand testimonies, but
such things can change overnight in a patch) that you can scribe the
level 39 scroll made by an Enchanter, even if the scroll states that
only Enchanters can use it; the left and right parts of Salil's Writ
pg. 174 are not too difficult to find.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Casual rewards</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Gravity Flux allows most applications of
Columns, except quad-kiting (long cast time, insufficient damage
concentration).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- The spell has a very special and unique
potential as a 6-million-dollar-man jump, allowing brilliant
shortcuts in some places. As an example, I was able to gain the
Concussion spell as soon as level 39, by means of "dueling" a
high-level Enchanter who Gravity-Fluxed me up the walls of City of
Mist. As another example, in dungeons where the way in and the way
out are normally different because of pitfalls (Kaesora, Droga),
Gravity Flux allows you to go in and out the way you want.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Funny spell to use for massive thrills in the
Arena.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Particularly deadly and disturbing pre-50 AE
spell to use on PvP servers. The fact that the second damaging step
follows the rules of falling damage is probably a rare occurrence of
a spell able to cause more damage in PvP (outdoors only) than in PvM.
The drawback that the spell affects allies might be overcome if your
allies wear all their "save magic" gear and buffs (they may be
unscathed thanks to the spell being all-or-nothing) and/or have
Levitate on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thunderbold is a targeted range spell, which
immediately damages and stuns a number of creatures of which I am not
sure, but probably 4, in a moderately wide radius around the target.
The stun lasts a few seconds, like for the "Tishan's Clash" series of
stun spells, but I do not know how the stun duration compares with
the single-mob spells of similar level (about which there are
conflicting reports; I suspect that the stun duration also depends on
the mobs). The spell is all-or-nothing, with a frequency which should
be similar to that of the single-mob stun spells. The cast time is
unusually short, and the recast time unusually long (18 seconds). The
aggro from the spell is probably above-average for an AE spell,
because of the stun feature (but, as usual, if the stun is
successful, your fighters have a few seconds to build up more hate
and retain the mobs).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Visual EFX</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I never saw it; I suspect it is a multiple
version of the Tishan's Clash EFX.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Critic</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A creative spell at last, giving an area-effect
dimension to a stun spell which we have learnt to cherish. The
damaging performance is almost as good as that of a Column, and the
single-cast swiftness is very good. The stats are good enough so that
the drawback of being all-or- nothing is compensated. The stun is a
strong defensive component, giving the spell good value and
versatility.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Casual rewards</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Thunderbold allows most applications of
Columns, except quad-kiting (the damage concentration is a bit low,
and the mob pack gets split between stunned and non-stunned).
Especially, I believe that it is a good crowd control tool, not only
because the stun gives your fighters a break, but also because, if
used skillfully early in the fight, a behavior difference may be
created between the mobs in order to split the pack, depending on
whether they resist or not (you're supposed to rely on previous Snare
or subsequent Root to deal with the mobs which resist the Thunderbold
and come for you).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Thunderbold may have a specific potential on
PvP servers as a quick opening spell on a surprised enemy party,
because the stun will give your party some time to gather and take
advantage of the surprise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Damage shields are buffs which are not by
nature AE spells, but perform as AE spells, because they affect
several creatures around a player or pet - provided that the
creatures attack that player or pet. Damage shields are undercover AE
spells, making fighters happy with gaining automatic retaliation
(each time a creature succeeds in hitting the fighter, it receives,
in return, a fixed damage which cannot be resisted). Amusingly,
low-green mobs tend not to be affected by the shield, because they
miss their hits. Most of the damage is, of course, delayed, and the
damage does not improve with level (at least for the level 4 Wizard
spell; damage shields of other classes seem to improve). The aggro
generated by the spell is generated when the buff lands on the target
player or pet, and there is </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">NO
ADDITIONAL AGGRO</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> when the shield deals
damage (neither toward you, nor toward the player or pet wearing the
buff), so, if you cast the spell before the mobs are aware of your
presence, the spell will not make creatures mad at you at all. The
damage done by the shield actually has no owner, and creates no
ownership rights on the mob (experience rights and looting rights); a
mob killed exclusively by means of a damage shield vanishes without
giving experience or leaving a body.</FONT></P>

of casting, not with every damage packet generated by the
shield.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The level 4 damage shield for Wizards has long
looked like a kind of aborted experience, made only to teach us how
these spells (abundantly used by Magicians and Druids) function. Now,
there seems to be an intermediate-level upgrade coming with Scars of
Velious in late 2000. The spells being able to distribute an
indefinite quantity of hits to an indefinite quantity of mobs for a
certain duration, with uneven distribution, my classical assessment
criteria are not much valid, and what matters really is how many hits
will be needed to equal or beat Shock in damage and damage/mana (you
will normally want to get much more out of the spell than out of a
standard Shock, or it's not worth the trouble). Whereas the level 4
spell is fair, I think that my information for level 34 is wrong (5
damage is extremely weak, see the other classes below; I suspect the
damage is actually 15).</FONT></P>

Wizards, to deserve much of my thought. Maybe the heat resistance
bonus is of use against a few mobs.</FONT></P>
