<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Everquest's interface is powerful, but takes
some time to master. Here are some tips which I didn't see on other
sites (or not too often), mostly about the interface and some
specific aspects of magic. This is all rather disorderly, because I
don't want to go encyclopedic about strategy for now.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">1) MUNDANE
TIPS</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">"Tomb Raider" playing
view</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To watch your group and your environment
properly, I advise to play a Wizard in "Tomb Raider" view instead of
"Quake" view (Quake view is for fighters getting their kick out
feeling themselves in the heat o battle; they call that "realism"; as
a result, they have no idea of where you are when you need help, and
they don't see the trains coming). Tomb Raider view has the
inconvenience of making mouse-targeting more difficult (you will
often target yourself), but this is hugely offset by the benefit of
wider vision (and of seeing yourself casting the pretty spells). To
get into Tomb Raider view: press F9 twice (you see your own back);
press Home to lock the camera focus on you; use Insert and Delete to
adjust camera distance; use Alt-Uparrow and Alt-Downarrow to adjust
camera height (if you didn't press Home, this gives you a periscopic
effect); use Alt-Pageup and Alt-Pagedown to unlock the camera focus
off you and look up or down; when you have your back to a wall, your
body will tend to become transparent so you can still see in front of
you; in dungeons, your body will tend to obstruct the screen, so you
may want to switch to Quake view, but I still use Tomb Raider view
99% of the time - it is manageable, and it also tends to reveal
secret passages.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Changing money at the
bank</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You are not obliged to abandon large quantities
of small change on the ground or bear their burden. Whenever you are
at the bank, take your coppers and put them in your silver box, then
take your silvers and put them in your gold box, then take your gold
coins and put them in the platinum box, et voil&agrave; ! You are
lightweight again and you have platinum for trade. This works with
the coin boxes of your purse as well as with the coin boxes of your
bank account, as long as you are at the bank.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">The command /loc</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You should program a social button with that
command. For giving appointments, for noting where your body will be
(when you are about to die), and to mark other places of interest to
you, you need /loc. Learn to interpret the figures: the higher the
first figure, the further North you are in the zone. The higher the
second figure, the further West you are in the zone. The point zero
zero is not necessary in the center of the zone (it can be on an
edge). Let's assume that the command gives you a result of 1085.14,
-824.58 and you want to tell a friend where you are: you will tell
your friend "plus1100 minus800 " and this is enough to find you.
About rounding: you can round to the nearest 50 (at least outdoors),
because each 15 of distance is only about the width of a dungeon
corridor. About writing "plus" and "minus" in full letters (or "pos"
and "neg"): the "+" and "-" signs most often don't pass through the
system, and the other player won't get them or will have a doubt.
About leaving a few spaces after the last digits: sometimes the last
letter of a message disappears, and you don't want a zero to
disappear, or the location is wrong by up to a few thousands.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Finding a group member with
/follow</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is useful to program a social button with
/follow for travelling under guidance. But this button can be useful
in combat too. When a group member is in trouble and you can't see
him or her, you may target him or her with PF key, and hit the
/follow button, and, if he or she is not too far away, you will
automatically run to him or her, so you can check what's
happening.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Repeating sentences with
Shift-Uparrow</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Pressing Shift-Uparrow will make you type again
the sentence or command which you last typed (and you can modify it
before validating it with Enter). By pressing repeatedly, you can
scroll back up through the last 19 sentences or commands you have
typed.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Selecting an item from a
stack with Ctrl-Leftclick</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you left-click on a stack of items in your
inventory, a box with a cursor appears to let you select how many you
want to move. To get only one item without the box appearing, you
have to keep Ctrl pressed while you click on the stack. This is
particularly useful when practicing trade skills. Note that, for ANY
combination of ingredients in a container, if the combination
involves two or more similar and stackable items, you must put each
item in a different box of the container, NOT all of them stacked in
one box of the container, or the combination will fail.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Jumping while
running</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is a classical tip, but you might not know
it if you are a newbie. When you are chased, jumping allows you to
gain some ground over the creature chasing you. You lose ground each
time you take a turn, so you should jump once or twice after taking a
turn. Your Stamina will not allow you to jump forever, though.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Spending practice
points</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For some time when I was a newbie, I had the
weird idea that spending practice points in a skill would increase
the skill cap (maximum score you can reach at your level). Not so;
practice points only get you started in a skill. I recommend to spend
3 points before starting a new weapon (spend nothing in the five
basic magical skills); if you get into Tailoring, spend 20 points
there (you won't even be allowed to spend more). If you seem unable
to get your Sense Heading skill started, you can consider spending a
few points in it. Save enough points to feed a particular skill which
is hard to practice: Research; practicing it with the Concordance of
Research book is tedious (when you first gain Research, you are
allowed to spend only one point in it, but, a few levels later, you
are allowed to start pouring practice points in it, and you will
possibly need to spend there all of the 5 practice points you gain
per level).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Creatures calling for help
(the mystery of lazy guards unveiled)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When a creature is angry at you (whether
fighting you or fleeing from you), it constantly broadcasts a cry for
help in a certain radius. Any other creature in this radius, friendly
to the first creature, will attack you (if it dares), even if is
friendly to you too (its friendship is biaised in favor of the first
creature). Who attacked first has no importance. When you are under
attack, nearby creatures friendly to you (especially guards and
merchants) will intervene in your favor if and only if they are
programmed to hate your opponent; if they don't care about your
opponent, they will "warmly" look at you dying.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Creature limitations versus
players</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I first wrote this as humor ("Top 16 reasons
why EverQuest is unfair to mobs"; an earlier version was published on
</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"><A HREF="http://klaknak.everquest.gamestats.com">The
Cackling Klaknak</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">), but there is solid
basis behind in terms of creature behavior. Think of these
limitations, before complaining that creatures can do impossible
things such as: see you through house walls, find you anywhere in the
zone once you caught their attention, stack (many of them clustering
in a space where only one player would fit), get past any number of
bodyguards to come and hit you whenever they feel like it, hit you
from beneath through the floor when they are unable to find the way
up to reach you, have a pet surviving the death of its master, have
several pets including charmed players, have backstab in addition to
attributes of other classes, etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">By the way, "mob" means "mean old bastard"; it
is the same as "NPC" ("non-player character"), but the term is more
combat-oriented.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) Neutral or friendly mobs can't "consider" us
to check if we like them (they can only hope that we will pass by, or
be content with doing quest transactions with them). Many had better
hide from us or flee without delay.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2) Aggressive mobs don't really attack us "on
sight", or they are as blind as moles (we can remain just outside
their reaction radius, showing them our butt and eating our lunch
unpunished until we are ready to fight, while they stand there
scowling at us and trying to look dignified, and we can cast our
first spell at them comfortably).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">3) Mobs can't perceive players as a group: they
"consider" you to know your level before deciding between attacking
and staying very quiet (or between retaliating and fleeing, in case
you attacked first), but they seemingly forget to take into account
your friends standing next to you (would you go thinking "great,
there is one blue gnoll next to these five red gnolls, I can attack
it safely" ?)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">4) Mobs don't routinely go invisible (they
could ambush and hunt us nicely; players would shout all the time
"plz give me see invis" in addition to "plz give me sow").</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">5) Mobs can't camp us at our home point (unless
we had real bad inspiration when choosing our binding place. Imagine
the mobs sitting at your home point for hours and chatting: "Do you
think he'll spawn soon ? - Wait, /who Dumbo all... He's on Plane of
Fear, first spawn should be soon, and respawn time is very short
after first spawn").</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">6) Mobs don't have Harmony to pull us
one-by-one (psst, mob, pull the Druid first for your
revenge...)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">7) Mobs can't kite us (mob would go: "yeah,
Druid, run panting after me while your life is eaten away by
DOT").</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">8) Mobs can't check the Internet for spoilers
and tactics (they could have arguments on mob discussion forums, such
as "Should one kill the healer or evacuator first ? - Evac's casting
time is 9 seconds, interrupt it near the end so the players lose more
time - Save your stunning bash for Greater Healing when a player is
almost dead", and so on).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">9) Mobs don't have long-distance communication,
such as group chat and guild chat (they cry for help in a
ridiculously small radius around them, and they can tell their story
over a long distance only by giving us bad faction when they die.
Imagine the Blackburrow gnolls with a "radio gnoll" chat channel to
coordinate their resistance against us intruders, with the gnoll
commander managing his troops dungeon-wide).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">10) A single mob routinely gets six of us
pounding at it suddenly, without anybody ever shouting "train" as a
warning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">11) Mobs can't taunt us away from our opponent
(picture yourself forced to give up your nearly dead mob opponent and
face a fresh mob instead...)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">12) Mobs can't zone or Gate when in danger
(leaving us exhausted, with no exp, walking back to our spot, and
having forgotten about them even if they zone back in).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">13) Mobs can't loot our bodies (did you say
"Ultima Online" ? &lt;shriiieeek&gt;)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">14) Mobs don't gain exp and levels when killing
players (with any luck, a gnoll pup could survive in Blackburrow
several months, and grow big enough to kill higher level players on
their way to Permafrost, then eventually become a mega-death level 54
gnoll equal to Vox or Nagafen - possibly giant size but still with "a
gnoll pup" name tag, or maybe it would have been allowed to choose a
second name at level 20, such as "a gnoll pup Spot").</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">15) Mobs can't plan elaborate large-scale
expeditions into a city to kill a level 50 player rumored to drop
rare and valuable loots.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">16) Mobs can't use cyber-flirt emotes ("a burly
gnoll stares dreamily into a gnoll pup's eyes", "an elite gnoll guard
massages a gnoll commander's shoulders"), get married in the Arena,
get drunk (with Blackburrow Stout), and duel.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Item availabilty and prices
according to server maturity</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Most of the items you find will not be useful
to you or to any player of your level, but you may sell or give them
to lower level players. So, the price of most not-too-rare items
depends on the composition of the player population: on a new server
with many low level players and few higher level players, item prices
will be high, and players will basically live with the equipment they
can conquer. On a mature server, there are many intermediate and high
level players, and items conquered by the player community tend to
accumulate (even if some of them are absorbed by the high level
players creating "twinked" newbies to try out other character
classes), so prices fall, and some useful items are even given out to
newbies. Conclusion: if you want Norrath to be yours to take, go to a
new server; if crowding doesn't bother you and you want nice
equipment quicker, go to an old server.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Experience distribution in
group</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is much rumor and legend about how
experience is distributed among group members. I'm still not quite
sure, but this is what I think I could derive from several
discussions in forums:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) There is an experience bonus for group play,
increasing with group size (the shared experience for each killed
creature adds up to more than what the creature would be worth in
solo play).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2) The damage inflicted to the creature by each
player (or other wrong done indirectly to the creature and making the
creature aggressive, such as healing the creature's opponent) does
NOT count when distributing experience among the players. Many
players believe that inflicting much damage has an importance, but it
seems that, on the contrary, the player sitting through the fights
gets as much experience as the other group members of the same level
(so, being lazy, or away-from-keyboard often, can be frowned upon).
The issue is critical to you as a Wizard, for you might want to
exhaust your mana supply constantly to keep up with the others, for
fear of not getting your share of experience; this is unnecessary.
The only things you need to do is have your own fun and keep the
group happy with you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">3) The contribution of players is measured by
their level, so the higher level players get a higher share of the
experience (if the level difference is too large, the lower level
players don't get any experience). It is hard to translate this in
terms of progression speed of the saffron experience bar, because the
amount of experience needed to reach the next level depends much on
class, race, and the current level. In other words, when cooperating
with a friend of a different level, you may want to know if this
causes the level gap between you to grow, diminish, or remain stable,
but I can't tell. When the level gap is already large, obviously,
playing together makes it grow even larger (because the lower level
player tends to get no experience at all). But, if the level gap is
small, you might be lucky enough so that playing together makes the
gap diminish or remain stable (this would be fair, unless the game
aims at separating friends...) You should make a test to be sure:
play exclusively together for some time, and then compare how many
bubbles were gained by each. </FONT></P>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">2) MAGIC
TIPS</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Casting a spell after
running</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you stop running and start casting a spell
immediately, it is almost certain that your spell will be
interrupted. This is probably the effect of routine lag. You should
wait almost one second before starting to cast, even if you are in
dire need. Creatures do not have to wait: they can stop running, cast
their spell, and resume running, without losing a fraction of a
second.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Interrupting your own
spells</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Wrong spell ? Or you think the creature will be
dead before you finish casting ? Press D for "duck" and wait until
the casting time is over, and you spend no mana (press D again to
stand up). If you are low-level, you may also do the same trick by
moving slightly, so you don't have to wait till the end of the
casting time - but you should still wait almost a second before
beginning casting another spell, or your movement will interrupt that
one too (you can't use that trick effectively at higher level,
because your chance of regaining concentration and casting the spell
nevertheless becomes sizeable, so you need to duck).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Virtues of the Staff of
Temperate Flux</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This Staff is Wizard-only, and probably the
best item obtained through a quest in the Temple of Ro, because it
does something nothing else does (the mask and cloak give good
Intelligence, and you can live without the kilt and wand). Note that
the "Staff of Ro" needed for the quest is obtained from another NPC
in the Temple, who calls it "Darkwood Staff". You don't need to equip
the Staff of Temperate Flux to use its power, and you can use it
while running. Now, why is it so good ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Only the Staff of Temperate Flux gives you
your own small free instant debuff spell against fire and cold. Any
additional chance of scoring full damage is good to take.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- The Staff's effect has the same range as
Shock. If you kite a creature with Bonds of Force, you can use the
Staff repeatedly while running, and when it tells you the creature is
out of range you know it's time to stop and cast. As Bonds of Force
lasts only 45 seconds, this is a valuable help in managing your
timing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- The Staff can be used repeatedly and has good
taunting power. It won't work very well against a creature very mad
at someone else, but, if the creature is hesitating a bit, you can
keep it aggressive against you indefinitely with the Staff without
spending mana. This is interesting, of course, in emergency
situations when you are low on mana and your group is low on life,
especially if the creature is Snared (or Bonds-of-Forced) so you can
escape from it, kiting it around the group while the group finishes
it off (the fighters might not understand your tactics; they might
think you are running in panic, and call you names, but they're not
very intelligent, you must explain to them). You may try to turn this
into a way of kiting with a Ranger or Shadowknight friend (you keep
the creature indefinitely mad at you with the Staff while the fighter
keeps it Snared and follows it hitting it in the back), but I tried
it and didn't find it very reliable (at least, don't do it with
creatures who have a natural high running speed, even if Snared they
will cause you trouble).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Virtues of Bonds of
Force</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The level 29 Bonds of Force is an ersatz of the
Druid's level 1 Snare spell, considerably less good; but it's still
very valuable, as the only spell of the kind that Verant gave us, so
let's accept it eagerly and say "thank you". Still, imagine if we had
Snare instead: it costs 15 mana instead of 75; the casting time is 2
seconds instead of 2.5; it lasts 2 minutes instead of 45 seconds; and
it is single-target instead of AE (for kiting, the AE feature of
Bonds of Force is actually a drawback: you almost never want to
affect several creatures with it, but you Bond yourself with it when
you use it in melee, so you're entitled to only one safe shot. In
melee against multiple not-too-big opponents in dungeons, though,
Bonds of Force might exceptionally save you, provided that all your
opponents are affected and you happen to resist it). Wizards would
rule the world if they were given the true Snare. If you Bond
yourself, your best chances to escape are either short-distance
Teleport (outdoors and downhill), or jumping while "running". Being
Bonded will not affect much your jumping speed, so, jumping can make
you gain quite some distance over your opponents until you are tired,
so you can zone or cast whatever single spell you want to save
yourself (obviously, this won't work if your opponents resisted the
Bonds and only you are Bonded). Now, you have other options, either
in addition to or instead of the above. You may take your chances and
Gate in spite of interruptions. Or you may try and Root your
opponents, so they don't move at all - but, when they break the Root,
the Bonds is gone and they run faster than you. Or, as another
desperate attempt, you may try to Root yourself: if you resist your
own Root, the Bonds remains, but, if the Root affects you, it breaks
the Bonds, and the Root has every chance to last a very short time
and let you free as the wind afterwards, while your opponents are
still Bonded. Don't try it more than once, though, or you will lose
too much time. You can also try the trick of Rooting yourself when
you suffer from another form of slow-movement spell (Snare, Clinging
Darkness), although I'm not sure it works.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Interrupting the spells of
others</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The best specialist of spell interruption is
the Enchanter, not the Wizard, but you have some tools. The spells
which you mostly want to interrupt are healing spells, for those
pesky healers just never die, whatever blast you pour into them. The
healing spells are: Healing (about 80 points healed, 3 seconds
casting time, Cleric level 14 or Shaman/Druid level 19, not a big
deal); Greater Healing (about 300 points healed, 3.8 seconds casting
time, Cleric level 19 or Shaman/Druid level 24, this one is pesky);
Superior Healing (about 500 points healed, 4 seconds casting time,
Cleric level 34, pesky too); Complete Healing (10 seconds casting
time, Cleric level 39, apparently not a big threat, but who knows).
Here are 3 spells with a casting time short enough so that you can
hope to interrupt healing spells with them:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) Tishan's Clash (level 20): doesn't do much
damage (30 to 40, for 60 mana), has moderate casting time (2.5
seconds), and will be among your regularly memorized spell anyway
because of the stunning effect, which lasts about 4 seconds and
interrupts spells. Being all-or-nothing, Tishan's Clash is somewhat
easily resisted (you can expect roughly a 20% resistance chance on
blues, 33% on whites, 50% on yellows, and high resistance on reds),
so it is best used preventively, not as a last resort. Having wasted
60 mana is usually not too painful, though. Also, it cannot be
chain-cast, so, if you can't kill the healer with a subsequent Shock,
you'd better have another spell-interrupting tool ready.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2) Force Shock (level 20): does nice damage
(179 maximum), has moderate casting time (2.8 seconds), and
interrupts spells consistently thanks to a brief stun, although you
get no system message telling you about the stun (no chance for the
creature to regain concentration and continue casting). But the
spell, being all-or-nothing, is easily resisted (see Tishan's Clash
above). Unless you are high level, it is very depressing to spend 120
mana for naught, and to see the creature heal back up instead. Also,
you cannot chain-cast this spell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">3) Shock of Lightning (level 12): has a short
casting time (2.2 seconds) and is said to interrupt spells by a
slight knock-back effect; I believe it is true, but, because of the
interference of fighters (!) and lag scrambling the order of
appearance of system messages on your screen, there is some room for
doubt on this spell's efficiency. Sometimes it seems to work,
sometimes not. At least, the creature is allowed a chance to regain
concentration and continue casting. However, you are almost sure to
score some damage, so I would say that Shock of Lighning, memorized
as a secondary damage spell, is worth using against healer creatures
just in case.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Anyway, even when using interrupt spells
technically shorter than the healing spell, if you wait until you see
the creature starting to cast the healing spell before starting to
cast yours, it's probably too late. The routine lag plays in the
creature's favor, and there is every chance that the healing spell
will be completed first. You need to feel the mood of your opponent
and anticipate a bit.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">A failed theory about high
resistance to "magic"</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When I was level 20, I thought I suddenly
understood that cold and heat-based spells would be reliable and
almost always do some damage, while "magic"-based spells would often
be fully resisted because creatures would have, on the average, a
resistance to "magic" higher than their resistance to heat or cold.
Well, not so: Root, Tishan's Clash, Force Shock, etc, use "magic"
energy, but are highly resisted because they are designed as
"all-or-nothing" (although one could argue that Root may have
"partial" effect through shorter duration). Other spells such as
Shock of Lightning, Cast Force, etc, are also "magic"-based and are
not "all-or-nothing", so they have regular resistance. By the way,
lightning is included in "magic", not "heat".</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Immunity of gigantic
creatures to stun</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">From level 20 on, you will regularly use stun
spells (Tishan's Clash and its upgrades), because they are nice
spells for the early stages of a fight (they will not annoy creatures
too much, and fighters like to be able to hit at creatures during a
few seconds without retaliation). However, on gigantic creatures such
as Giants of all kinds (and also Cyclops I believe), Nagafen, Vox,
Cazic Thule, Innooruuk, Dracoliche, the stun is inefficient. It's not
a matter of resistance: the creature will not necessarily resist your
spell, but will take only the "damage" part of the effect, and will
not be stunned at all (or the stun duration will be almost null),
although you get a system message telling you that it is
stunned.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Virtues of skin spells
(Shieldskin, Leatherskin, etc)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Skin spells make you munch costly gems (I carry
a basic stock of 40), but they are well worth it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) Basically, the skin spells give you those
precious extra seconds to finish something important, both in a group
(when the time comes to chain-cast and expose yourself, a mere few
seconds of additional survival time allow you to get your share of
the victory) and in solo (in the intermediate levels, you can solo
with Root and Shock most non-Root-resistant blue creatures, if and
only if you buy the time for extra Root attempts with your skin spell
- when the creature is Rooted and your skin spell is gone, refresh
the skin spell before blasting).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2) Skin spells are a diplomatic asset in a
group and allow you to be brave (hence the expression "skin
tanking"). Most groups will consider that you should even avoid
attracting the creatures' attention on you, and, especially, the
group's healers will not like having to watch over you, unless the
situation is exceptionally hot and the group needs you to chain-cast
spells. However, the contrary is also true: if no creature ever turns
on you and you always stay quietly undisturbed, you might be
suspected of being lazy. Being attacked is the proof that you
contribute. Skin spells are the perfect solution, acting as
preventive self-heals, allowing you to be reasonably active in
battle, while making you routinely independent from healers (at least
in the intermediate levels; maybe not at high level). Skillful use of
blast spells and skin spells will show your group that you are able
to manage effectively your offense and your defense, so you may get
away with other things (using AE spells, for instance). By the way,
here is something for Wizard ears only: with the Wizard-only Staff of
Temperate Flux, you can create an illusion of contribution by making
a creature mad at you without spending any mana... I'm not telling
you to do it ! But you can save a group member with the Staff,
because it can be activated repeatedly in no time until the taunting
is successful (then, the group can recollect itself while you tank),
whereas a direct damage spell takes several seconds and might not
suffice, and a Root or stun spell is unreliable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">3) The skin spell, acting as an alarm signal,
allows you not to care much for your life bar. As long as you get the
"your magical skin absorbs the blow" messages, you don't care at all
for your life bar. As soon as you start taking damage, it's time to
put more emphasis on evasive action. Without this signal, you need to
watch your life bar closely to decide when you are safe and when you
are in danger (the bar moves fast), and you don't want to do that:
you want to concentrate on what you're doing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">4) Even after you stop using weapons, you still
need to melee on a frictional basis, to improve your Defense and
Dodge skills. Wearing your skin spell in group play, you can afford
to take blows for a short time, to improve your defensive skills,
without losing noticeable life.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">5) Skin spells will absorb some forms of
magical damage in addition to melee damage, including the
Shadowknights' Harm Touch, but they will not absorb, for instance,
falling damage, or damage-over-time (once a DOT spell sticks on you,
you start losing life while your skin spell remains in place). As
long as your skin holds, melee hits will not poison you (skin spells
make you even more brave against venomous creatures). But the skin
will not protect you from stunning hits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">6) Beware that refreshing your skin spell in
battle (once your opponent has been taunted away from you) has a huge
taunting effect (the creature is likely to change its mind and come
back for you).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">7) Beware that, although absorbing melee
damage, the skin will not prevent your spells from being interrupted
by hits. The chances of regaining concentration might be higher
thanks to the skin (because it seems that low-damage hits are easier
to regain concentration from, but I'm not sure whether the important
factor is the low damage or the low level of the attacking
creature).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">8) Remember that, to cast some of their spells,
other spellcasters need the same gems than you do (for instance,
Clerics need them for their symbol spells); so you can give or lend
them some if needed, as well as borrow some from them.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">The level 20 Enstill is not
an upgrade to the level 4 Root</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you're still a teenage Wizard, don't wait
for Enstill with high hopes. Enstill is superior to Root only in
duration, and only if you leave the creature alone: the spell is
broken as soon as the creature takes the slightest damage; think of
it as a bad Mesmerize (Enchanter spell), with a purpose only if you
manage to glue the creature somewhere away from the combat. 99% of
the time, Root will do the same job and much more, so you don't have
to spend a memorization slot on Enstill. The upgrade to Root is the
level 39 Immobilize (the level 49 Paralyzing Earth is an "upgrade" to
Enstill).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Concept of downtime
reduction through grouping</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is only nice-to-have theory, so I will be
short (many factors I won't consider, such as group experience bonus
and non-damage crowd control tools). The goal is to enjoy playing and
to eliminate the "particularly boring" downtime (for instance, when
half the group is ready and the other half is not ready); the name of
the game is not to maximize the "experience gained / time played"
ratio.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) When 2 fighters (of the same level) group,
they need half as much time as in solo to kill a creature, and they
each earn half the experience. But, during the fight, the creature is
able to deal only half the damage it would have inflicted in a solo
fight, and this damage is (or should) be divided evenly, so each
fighter takes 4 times less damage than in solo; the recovery downtime
per creature is cut in 4. When 3 fighters group, the experience per
creature and per fighter is cut in 3, for a recovery downtime per
creature cut in 9; and so on (4 for 16, 5 for 25, 6 for 36). This is
a huge downtime saving. Then, the death downtime (the time needed to
recover your body after defeat and regain the lost experience) is
harder to put in equations, but at least you know that a group can
take on yellow or red creatures which would be impossible to solo,
and this can be calculated: if a creature can inflict to the solo
fighter, before dying, damage equal to 200% of the solo fighter's
life (so the solo fighter dies while the creature is still at half
life), when facing two fighters, the creature will die 2 times
quicker and will have time to inflict only damage equal to 100% of
one fighter's life, and the damage will be split, so the fighters
will win the fight, and lose only 50% life each. Here, you have an
all-or-nothing difference between solo play and group play which is
invaluable in terms of downtime reduction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">2) When 2 Wizards (of the same level) group,
they need half as much time as in solo to kill a creature, but it
doesn't matter - what matters is that each spends half the mana - and
they each earn half the experience. So, the recovery downtime per
creature is cut in 2 (instead of 4 in the case of a fighter group;
recovery for a Wizard is mana recovery, rather than life recovery).
When 3 Wizards group, the experience per creature and per Wizard is
cut in three, for a recovery downtime per creature cut in 3 (instead
of 9 in a fighter group); and so on (4 for 4, 5 for 5, and 6 for 6,
instead of 4 for 16, 5 for 25, and 6 for 36 in a fighter group).
There is NO GAIN of recovery downtime versus solo play in a Wizard
group. However, the all-or-nothing and invaluable downtime reduction
for winning a fight in group versus losing it in solo is roughly the
same as for fighters. So, while fighter-only groups tend to roll,
Wizard-only groups don't roll, they are just safer than solo
play.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">3) Draw your own conclusions for mixed groups.
As far as I could feel, a Wizard in a mixed group doesn't contribute
to the recovery downtime reduction of the group as well as an
additional fighter would, but may provide greater flexibility against
some forms of tougher opposition, so his or her contribution to the
death downtime reduction of the group might be slightly higher. Also,
Wizards need to optimize their mana expenditure to minimize the
group's recovery downtime (if they spend too much mana, the group has
to wait for them, and it doesn't compensate for a shorter fight. If
they don't spend enough mana, the healers get exhausted supporting
the fighters, and the Wizards have to wait for them).</FONT></P>
