<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">1) IMPORTANCE OF STAYING
HIGH ON MANA</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The basic difference between fighter offense
and Wizard offense is that the weapons of a fighter generate
continuous, steady damage at no cost (except ongoing time
consumption), whereas the spells of a Wizard generate damage on
demand, at the cost of mana (and the mana supply is limited, with a
meditation recovery time roughly 10 times longer than the time
consumed casting the spells). A Wizard shines more than a fighter
when turning the damage tap on, and (obviously) shines less than a
fighter when turning the damage tap off (to spare or recover mana).
Likewise, a fighter enjoys continuous protection from his/her armor
at no cost, whereas a Wizard's magical defenses are put up on demand,
at a price, and some of them are expendable - but they're more
powerful than plain armor. So, basically, a Wizard is a
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">flexible</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">
fighter, and has the immediate potential to shine if, and only if,
he/she is high on mana. If, in any settings, a Wizard tends to run
low on mana while the rest of the group continues to thrive,
performing properly as a magical fighter is impossible.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">2) UNFAVORABLE GROUP
COMPOSITION</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Importance of
seniority</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The lower-level players of a group have the
handicaps of being mob magnets, and of having a lesser capacity to
contribute. But this is to be appreciated differently depending on
class. A junior fighter can do his/her job continuously and
relatively undisturbed, provided that the group also includes a
senior fighter (because the junior fighter doesn't consume any
resource, and the senior fighter attracts the mobs with his/her
higher damage output). On the contrary, a junior Wizard tends to
suffer in all cases, eventually feeling like baggage: either bold
blasting causes deadly retaliation from overpowered mobs, or shy
blasting brings no noticeable contribution; either the Wizard sits
through some of the fights as a precaution, or the mana runs out and
the Wizard is forced to sit anyway. This isn't to say that Wizards
need seniority in order to shine: they can shine when grouping with
fighters of equal, or slightly higher, level. But, when grouping with
players roughly 3-4 levels higher, a Wizard must be prepared to be
humble, sit, and keep the damage tap turned off most of the time,
unless he/she can fall back on very mana-efficient fighting
tactics.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Group size and proportion of
fighters</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Whereas casters (</FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">including Wizards</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">) are
more powerful than fighters in solo, fighters have the inherent power
of multiplying, or, more accurately, "squaring" their forces when
grouped (instead of just adding them up). Consider a pair of
fighters: to kill a mob, they need half the time which a solo fighter
needs, and, during this time, the mob inflicts half the damage,
shared evenly between the two (if they're clever), so, each fighter
takes, on the average, 4 times less damage than in solo; the downtime
to recover from the fight is 4 times shorter, not 2 times shorter.
Likewise, 3 fighters cut their downtime in 9, and 4 fighters cut it
in 16, 5 fighters in 25, and 6 fighters in 36; this is what I call
"squaring" forces. On the contrary, 6 Wizards can kill a mob spending
6 times less mana each, and need 6 times less meditation to recover,
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">not</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> 36
times less meditation. Add a healer to a fighter-heavy group, to
rectify the occasional uneven distribution of damage between the
fighters, and you have a rolling group, which needs almost no rest,
as long as it doesn't pick heavy fights. Add a Wizard to a
fighter-heavy group, and the group isn't much improved regarding
damage output over time: if the Wizard tries to keep up with the
others, he/she quickly runs out of mana and must sit, while the
others are still very much kicking. Also, if the fighters have a good
coordination, their combined damage output speed on any single mob is
such that the legendary Wizard speed shines much less (the mob will
often die before the spell is completed !) In summary, a Wizard tends
to be shut off and lose value as a damage-dealer in large
fighter-heavy groups, unless he/she can fall back on very
mana-efficient fighting tactics, or is happy sitting there as a kind
of insurance against vague deadlier perils.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">3) MANA-EFFICIENT FIGHTING
TACTICS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Most tactics I know are thematically mentioned
in the inventory of gameplay attributes serving as an introduction to
my area-effect spell guide; but here's a reminder of some ways to
continuously contribute to kills with minimum mana expenditure (so
that the shining flexibility provided by the mana supply is
preserved). Most of these tactics depend on gaining the appropriate
tools first. All of them assume that you're wearing your
damage-absorbing Skin spell (beyond your teens, you can't be brave
without it).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Using
weapons</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> (including Solist's Icy
Wand)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">While the use of weapons is incompatible with
meditation, it's an interesting source of damage for Wizards up to
their low 20s, especially in the early part of fights (blasting being
more appropriate in the late part). After level 20, the mobs' armor
class and hit points start rocketing beyond the ambitions of the
Wizards' weak and clumsily wielded Dragoon Dirks and Water Crystal
Staves, and Wizards gain Tishan's Clash as an alternate early-fight
contribution, so, Wizards learn to sit when not casting, to reduce
downtime. I was frustrated when I understood that I would never melee
again with my fighter friends. But I was amazed, much later, at level
35, when I gained a Solist's Icy Wand (from Kurn's Tower, in Field of
Bone, Kunark): it's a Wizard-only wand dealing 38 damage in 5.5
seconds, for free, with no recast time; the sole costs are giving up
other activities and occupying a hand slot. From the mid-20s onwards,
it's pathetic to insist on wielding a 6-damage 23-delay melee weapon
(that's the Dragoon Dirk, with almost guaranteed miss or negligible
damage from each attempt because of insufficient skill); but the Wand
performs as a 19-damage 55-delay weapon, with two major advantages
(it's range instead of melee, and scores full damage with a very high
frequency) as well as two drawbacks (the delay occurs before the hit,
and is very much paralyzing, whereas the delay of regular weapons
occurs after the hit, and allows to switch to doing something else).
In spite of the delay-related drawbacks, what an upgrade to the old
Dirk ! And what a slap in the face of the poor Rangers with their
bows ! The Wand even allows you to "dual wield" in melee, holding the
Wand in your off-hand and a weapon in your main hand (preferably
Staff of Writhing or Dagger of Frost). Explanation: when you cast a
true spell, and want to hit the mob with your weapon afterwards, the
weapon's delay applies after spell completion, so, you must wait
before you can hit; but, in the case of the Wand, your weapon's delay
runs while the Wand is casting, so, the weapon hits immediately after
the Wand fires off (unless your weapon has a delay of 55 or more),
and you can activate the Wand immediately again; in short, the weapon
adds damage, but doesn't add delay. For some cheap and
not-so-ineffective fun in easy group fights, I "dual wield" and stun.
Alas, I suspect that this starts flirting severely with "waste of
time" from level 44 on, when the more spectacular Conflagration spell
is gained, adding sharp value to meditation for more frequent
cast.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At least until level 43, the Solist's Icy Wand
is a superb boon, the true intermediate-level upgrade to the melee
weapons used by teenage Wizards, ideal for participating in routine
fights while staying fresh for heavier opposition. By the way, at
level 39, the Wand's special EFX changes, and becomes much more
beautiful.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Acting as an
Enchanter</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is giving up routine mana-intensive
offense, and putting emphasis on facilitating the fighters' work with
cheap mob incapacitation, mostly in the form of Root, stun, Snare,
and taunt, so that your mana bar stays fresh with minimal meditation.
The taunt is essential, and is best provided for free by the Staff of
Temperate Flux (obtained through a difficult quest in the Temple of
Ro) in addition to the taunt from avariciously-used damage spells.
Root is gained so early (level 4) that you can't even afford it at
first, but it serves you faithfully forever afterwards (no need to
look up to the would-be upgrades). Stun (Tishan's Clash) is gained at
level 20, but you begin perceiving it as cheap only several levels
later. Area-effect Snare (Bonds of Force) is gained at level 29, and
you may perceive it as cheap relatively quickly.</FONT></P>

<P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Root</FONT></U></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
serves for "mob parking", that is, pinning down excess mobs in a
location where they're powerless, as if they had been Mesmerized by
an Enchanter. The challenge is to Root a mob away from the fighters,
without spending mana specially for creating the distance; you can
Root the mob where it stands and ask the fighters to move (tough
luck), or use your Staff of Temperate Flux, which is quasi-instant
with no recovery time, in order to accumulate hate quickly, and start
casting Root as soon as the mob shows vengeful intentions. An
area-effect spell (preferably a </FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"><A HREF="aecolumn.html">Column</A></FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial">) may have the consequence of pulling one excess mob
from the fighters, so that you can "park" it. This is much less
effective than an Enchanter's Mesmerization, especially at higher
levels (forget it completely in raids, especially when the mobs can
Summon instead of coming to you), but is still a worthwile tactics in
many settings.</FONT></P>

<P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Stun</FONT></U></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
gives your fighters a break for a few seconds, and also gives YOU a
bit of extra time to think about what you want to do. The spell has a
long recast time, and provides no real shining additional rewards
except interrupting heals; but skillful timing improves it somewhat,
in any situation. There is also an offense-oriented calculation about
how stun especially helps you when you are in large fighter-heavy
groups, and you tend to fall behind because your DD looks
superfluitous and consumes too much mana. Basically, your DD does
some damage for some mana (for instance, at level 45, it does 610
damage for 260 mana), and you can calculate how much damage it
represents for 60 mana (at level 45, 610 / 260 x 60 = 141 damage).
Tishan's Clash stuns for some time and does 30 damage plus 1 per
level, with a maximum of 50 (at level 45, 50 damage), for 60 mana.
So, when you choose Tishan's Clash over DD, you give up some damage
to get a few seconds of stun instead, and you can calculate how much
damage you give up (at level 45, you give up 141-50=91 damage). When
the mob is alone, you can think of the stun as a "time stop" which
allows your fighters to inflict extra damage to the mob; this extra
damage is inflicted thanks to your stun, so, you can claim that YOU
have inflicted it. If the extra damage (hard to measure, but you can
get a feel of it) is greater than the damage which you have given up
when choosing stun over DD (for instance, at level 45, if your
fighters are able to inflict more than 91 damage during the stun),
then your stun ends up being a more efficient damage-dealer than your
DD. Furthermore, the stun is also smaller than the DD, so that you
can choose to use the stun 1, 2 or 3 times per fight, instead of
either casting an expensive DD or doing nothing. In short, when your
group gets large and fighter-heavy, the effectiveness of your stun
increases to compensate the loss of sting and staying power of your
DD. Isn't that great ? Your DD will still be appreciated in fights
against multiple mobs, at times of pressure peaks (mob harder than
expected, multiple fight - in this case, your stun isn't a true "time
stop", because only one mob is affected... but wait for the level 54
Thunderbold AE spell). Clerics, being better at healing than at
blasting, will normally do the same kind of reasoning, but
defense-oriented: they will compare how much healing they give up
when stunning, with how much damage the mob would have inflicted
during the stun; this defense-oriented calculation depends only on
the mob's offensive power, not on how many fighters are in the
group.</FONT></P>

<P><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial">Bonds of Force</FONT></U></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">, combined with taunt, can allow you to pull the excess
mobs and kite them around while the fighters finish their current
opponent (a kind of "walk-the-mob" replacing "mob parking"). Bonds of
Force is also a precaution against bigger mobs, allowing you to
over-nuke them later if needed, with no fear of immediate retaliation
if you have sufficient safe space to run around (fighters often
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">hate</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> it
when you run around, because they're lazy, and hitting the air is a
vexation; but they should think twice in many cases, and should be
grateful that you give them a break, as long as the break benefits
the group more than it benefits the mobs; see also "hate-kiting"
below).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In summary, although you will never beat an
Enchanter in his/her own field, you have effective ways of doing the
same kind of job (some call it "crowd control", although the concept
doesn't exactly coincide with what I'm trying to describe here); and
the point is that you can revert to being an angry near-full-mana
Wizard anytime, whereas an Enchanter can't.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Hate-kiting</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is, as far as I know, my own invention
(dated July 2000): I never heard of any Wizard doing that before. The
idea is to create a </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">shining</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> fighter/Wizard
winning combination in the absence of a healer. As any kiting, it's
possible only outdoors; and it works mostly on large-diameter slow
mobs, typically the not-too-big Giants and Wurms (small-diameter
speedy mobs, such as the various cats, will evade swiftly the
fighters' hits; even large mobs may be missed if there's too much
lag). You need only one fighter, but 2 or 3 are better. 4 or 5
fighters will probably be too lazy to run, and will choose to stay
still and share the damage. Semi-kiting is best done at level 29+ (to
enjoy the Snare-like spell Bonds of Force), with a Staff of Temperate
Flux to generate the aggro for free. If you're below level 29, you
need a hybrid with Snare (Ranger or Shadowknight), and the tactic
doesn't perform as well, because the hybrid must recast Snare several
times in melee if the first attempt fails, taking heavy damage and
spoiling the fun. If you don't have the Staff of Temperate Flux, you
must spend much more mana to keep the mob mad at you, so, the tactic
doesn't bring such bright rewards.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here it is: the fighters pull a mob; you Snare
it, debuff it with the Staff (unless your Shock is "magic"-based),
then cast your Shock as quickly as possible. You don't even
absolutely need to blast, if you've got at least two good
damage-dealing fighters with you. The mob comes for you; run away to
safety, and continue to excite the mob against you with the Staff,
while the fighters follow the mob hitting it in the back unpunished.
try to keep a straight line, with minimal turns, or the mob's path
will begin to ghost, and the fighters will miss their hits. The
fighters mustn't use their taunt skill, because you're the taunter;
and Paladins mustn't Root, or the mob is entitled to retaliate. If
the fighters deal damage too slowly, the fight may last too long and
the Snare may wear off, so you may have to blast more, or let the
fighters take the mob back while you Snare it again. Ideally, mobs
which would have exhausted the group in regular still fighting can be
beaten that way with minimal damage for the fighters (taken while you
initially Snare and blast once) and minimal mana expenditure for you
(for the initial Snare and blast). Now that I have Journeyman's
boots, I even pull the mobs myself and serve them to my fighters on a
silver plate, all debuffed and Snared, ready for beating. The main
risk is encountering an additional mob while running, but you can
leave that one aside with Root if you're skillful. Again, this is for
groups without a healer; if you have a healer, regular still fighting
is most probably better, because staying still markedly contributes
to coordination and safety, and the basic fighter/healer winning
combination is effective enough.</FONT></P>

this particular essay. In strong groups able to routinely face
multiple mobs without using Mesmerize, the concentrated brutality of
your direct damage may pass unnoticed, and you may choose area-effect
spells instead, just for a chance to throw in equal or larger damage,
at an equal or lower mana cost (funny damage/mana gambling), but,
still, your contribution probably won't have much sting, and there
are personal risks involved. As mentioned above in "acting as an
