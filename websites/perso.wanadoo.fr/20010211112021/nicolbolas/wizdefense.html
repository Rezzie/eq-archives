<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">1) Mob incapacitation
(active defense)</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">: (reminder) "Mob
incapacitation" is defined as all means to affect mobs so that they
temporarily can't cause harm to you and/or your allies ("all means"
short of immediate and permanent death, which is a plain application
of DD or AE damage). "Mob incapacitation" is offense by nature
(because you are doing something to the mobs), but it is defense by
destination (the outcome is that some harm is avoided). The champion
of mob incapacitation is the Enchanter, but Wizards deal in several
ways to incapacitate mobs: movement-hampering, stun, and aggro
control. Wizards don't have, for instance: Charm, Fear, Harmony,
Mesmerize (defined as a very long stun which is broken if the mob
takes damage), and pets (which, in addition to being continuous
damage sources, perform as defensive lures keeping mobs busy, i.e.
preventing the mobs from attacking players).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Root</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">: Root
(lvl 4), Enstill (lvl 20), Immobilize (lvl 39), Paralyzing Earth (lvl
49), Fetter (lvl 58). Many classes have the superbly versatile Root,
but only Wizards can't live without it, and have the incentive to
become Root artists. Root is the Wizards' primary means of breaking
free from melee. Beware that the spells have two distinct profiles, a
"versatile" profile (Root, Immobilize) with short cast time and low
mana cost, and a "double duration" profile (Enstill, Paralyzing
Earth), which is of much less use because of the annoying added cast
time and mana cost. From most testimonies, Root and Enstill have the
same chances of sticking, and the same chances of breaking from
magical damage (although I believed, for a very long time, that
Enstill broke more easily). Melee damage doesn't seem to break Root
at all. The Rooted mobs are harmless, provided that there is none of
your allies within mob reach (unless the mobs also enjoy range
attacks, such as spells, or, worse, can Summon). The first Root-based
tactic which Wizards learn is "Root bombing": comfortably casting DD
spells on a Rooted mob. Even when the level 29 Bonds of Force spell
is gained (see "AE Snare" below), "Root bombing" still prevails in
dungeons, and as a possible fall-back option outdoors when Bonds of
Force fails. Now that (January 2001) Root doesn't overwrite Snare
anymore, and does its own effect separately, Root helps, in
conjunction with Snare, to give some meditation time near the end of
a tough kiting. The second important Root-based tactic is "mob
parking": Rooting one (or more) mobs somewhere away from where the
fight happens. "Mob parking" is functionally similar to Mesmerize,
although more complicated and much less powerful. Root can also be
used for "runner pin-down", but is mediocre for that purpose (see "AE
Snare" below).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">AE Snare</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Bonds of Force (lvl 29), Atol's Spectral Shackles (lvl 51). These
spells are AE, that is, they are more expensive than single-mob Snare
spells, and they can backfire; still, they are worth using on a
single mob, and their AE feature can be put to use reasonably often.
Note that I never succeeded in affecting more than 3 mobs at once
with Bonds of Force, although some seem to think it can affect 4. The
first important Snare-based tactic is "kiting", especially outdoors:
the mob will be incapable of harming you, because you run faster than
it does (of course, long-range attacks such as spell attacks won't be
fully shut off). The second important Snare-based tactic is "runner
pin-down": when a mob's life is so low that it tries to run, Snare
effectively pins it down to the ground, and the mob still doesn't
fight and can't go call other mobs for help, so it's an important
contribution to a group's cohesion and safety. Furthermore, if you
Snare the mob early in the fight, you get the added benefit that, if
you later over-blast the mob, it can't reach you immediately for its
revenge.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Stun</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
(hybridated with some damage): Tishan's Clash (lvl 20), Markar's
Clash (lvl 49), Tishan's Discord (lvl 51), Thunderbold (lvl 54),
Markar's Discord (lvl 56). Note that Thunderbold is an AE damage
spell, with a very interesting mix of damage and stun length. Stun
shuts off a mob completely for some time. Wizards are probably the
third best stunners in the game, after Enchanters and Clerics. In a
static group fight, stun basically prevents some melee damage from
being inflicted by the mob to the fighters, and also allows to
interrupt the mob's spells. Interrupting spells is functionally a
defensive move, preventing something unpleasant from happening
(although it is more offensive, even functionally, when the
interrupted spell is a heal). In solo play, you have no fighters to
protect, so, stun spells will be memorized only when fighting a
caster/healer mob (good luck, because they are tough !) Tishan's
Clash is also one of the rare spells with which Wizards can assist a
low-level player without stealing the kill.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Short stun and pushback</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial"> (side effect of damage): Force Shock (lvl 20), Thunder
Strike (lvl 29), Force Strike (lvl 44). These spells are essentially
damage spells with all-or-nothing effects and relatively high
resistance, so, their large mana cost is often wasted, and they're
not very popular; they will be used almost only against caster/healer
mobs, because the split-second stun interrupts spells without
possibility of regaining concentration. The pushback can also,
rarely, push a mob off a ledge. Two AE damage spells also have this
effect before level 50: Thunderclap (lvl 34) and Force Spiral of
Al'Kabor (lvl 39), but the latter isn't worth using. A few other
spells have a pushback effect without split-second stun, either on
players and mobs (but it is difficult to perceive for sure), or on
players only. Those spells affecting mobs are supposed to be Cast
Force (lvl 24), Shock Spiral of Al'Kabor (lvl 29), and the post-50
Jyll's series of PB spells. Those spells affecting players only (in
PvP) seem to be the lightning-based Shocks and Fire Spiral of
Al'Kabor (lvl 20). Pushback without stun may cause spell
interruption, but concentration may be regained.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Evade</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> (or hate
reduction): Concussion (lvl 39). While Concussion doesn't make mobs
physically impotent, it tampers with their ability to choose you as
their opponent: it tends to make them "incapable" of attacking you,
at your allies' expense. Concussion seems to carry a fixed hate
increase (but small, smaller than Root, for instance), and seems to
remove a </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">fraction</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Arial"> of the mob's hate towards you when not resisted. So, it
cannot ever make the mob forget you completely, and a resist
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">may</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> be
dangerous (but extremely rarely).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Taunt</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> (side
effect of various abilities): hate increase tends to make the mobs
incapable of attacking your allies, at your own expense. Wizards are
the best taunters in town, thanks to their damage spells and their
Skin spells (and the free bonus aggro from the Staff of Temperate
Flux). The Wizards' swift and consistent power to enrage mobs mustn't
be underestimated: when combined correctly with other defenses, it
greatly improves a group's health and safety.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Frenzy phase skip</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial"> (effect of damage timing): mobs are said to go berserk
like Warriors do, and inflict heavier wounds when, roughly, their
life goes below 2 bubbles ("frenzy phase"). When the mobs' life runs
even lower, they go into running phase (but some mobs are very brave,
and never run; they must be killed outright). Wizards can time their
DD spells so that the frenzy phase is skipped, and the fighters are
spared the extra frenzy damage, at no additional mana cost. I was
never able to measure this exactly, though; I treat it rather a rumor
which makes sense. By the way, as a young Wizard, I was happy when my
Shock killed the mob; as an intermediate-level Wizard, I am rather
disappointed when I score the kill, because this means that a
fraction of my mana was wasted: I like it better when my Shock causes
the mob to turn its back and try to flee.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Runner finish-off</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial"> (effect of damage timing): if the runner can't be
pinned down, kill it with a quick DD. This is not "mob
incapacitation" as I defined it to start with, because it is
immediate death; but "runner finish-off" deserves to be cited here,
as an alternative to "runner pin-down" with identical rewards in
terms of group cohesion and safety (the fighters don't have to
venture far away, and the mob can't call for help), and can also be
cited as a combat phase skip functionally similar to the "frenzy
phase skip".</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Debuffing</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Cancel Magic (lvl 12), Nullify Magic (lvl 34), Annul Magic (lvl 53).
"Debuff" has two meanings in this game, the first being "put a curse
on a mob", and the second being "remove a buff from a mob"; the
second meaning only is relevant here. This "debuff" is most often
used for defense (usually removing a damage shield from a mob, or
removing a Charm from a party member) rather than for facilitating
offense (removing protective shields; this is often done in PvP, but
can also be done profitably on some mobs). Any spellcaster can do
that kind of debuff, so, this is only a side ability of Wizards; but
note that the Intelligence-based casters get the upgrades sooner than
the Wisdom-based casters (and the upgrades are bright; one cast of
Nullify Magic seems to do more than three casts of Cancel
Magic).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">2) Prevention / evasion
(passive defense)</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">: "Prevention /
evasion" spells are pure defense: they don't </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">do</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> anything to any mobs,
but, still, their outcome is that some harm is avoided. "Prevention /
evasion" spells are many, and some of them are exciting.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Shielding</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Minor Shielding (lvl 1), etc. These spells (giving armor class, hit
points, and resistance to Magic) are hardly worth mentioning, because
all spellcasters are able to generate that kind of buff, and they
might as well be considered part of the inherent stats of the class,
especially when the spells are self-only. The good news is that they
can be cumulated with most other protective buffs given by Clerics
and Druids.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Resistance self-buffs</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Arial">: Resistant Skin (lvl ), elemental Shield (lvl ),
Elemental Armor (lvl 44)</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">(to be completed)</FONT></I></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Skin spells</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Shieldskin (lvl 16), Leatherskin (lvl 24), Steelskin (lvl 34),
Diamondskin (lvl 44), Manaskin (lvl 52). These expendable
damage-absorbing shields are brilliant, and allow Wizards to show
more bravery than Magicians would ("skin tanking"). The Skin spells
will absorb melee damage, but not falling damage. They will absorb
most forms of direct magical damage, including Harm Touch, but they
will not absorb magical DOT (as a separate effect, they will protect
against melee DOTs such as poison, because the DOT won't even attempt
to stick as long as no melee damage is taken). It is disputed whether
the Skin spells help regain concentration from hits or not; at any
rate, they don't protect against the stun from bash attacks. I
believe that the Skin spells help against interruption because the
hits create a smaller pushback. Under continuous attack, the Skin
spells will usually not hold for more than one or two handful
seconds, but this extra time is precious for breaking free with
minimal wounds. Skin spells also act as an alarm signal: as long as
hits are absorbed, you don't even have to watch your life bar, and
you can concentrate on what you're doing; as soon as you start taking
damage, it's time to be more careful and emphasize evasive action.
Beware that refreshing the Skin spell generates high aggro. Skin
spells are a must for solo play, and bring much relief in group
(because your safety is roughly assured, and you can allow yourself
to care more for the safety of others; the group's healers will also
not be distracted by a dropping life bar of yours, unless the
situation is serious). Necromancers have the same spells, but
generally under-utilize them, because their pet suffices as a lure
most of the time; and Enchanters have similar spells which can be
transferred (Runes). By the way, the fact that the Skin spell is
self-only is a kind of advantage in combat, because you can refresh
it without losing your target.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Invisibility</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">:
See Invisible (lvl 4), Invisibility (lvl 16), Invisibility vs Undead
(lvl 39), Improved Invisibility (lvl 55). Almost all character
classes can turn Invisible in some way. Invisibility is acquired by
Wizards moderately late, and is an enormous factor of safety when
travelling or meditating. The champions in this field are the
Enchanters, who have not only various forms of Invisibility, but
Illusions as well.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Levitate</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Levitate (lvl 24). Wizards are not the best levitators (short
duration, no side benefit), but Levitate is great for preventing
falling damage in mountain zones and pit-infested dungeons, and for
flying high across some mob-populated zones while staying vertically
beyond mob aggro range. Levitate sometimes helps you escape from
opponents long enough to Gate (by means of flying out of a building
window, over water, or off a ledge).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Yonder</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">: Fade
(lvl 4), Shadow Step (lvl 8), Yonder (lvl 29)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This quick and random intra-zone Teleport
becomes almost obsolete as soon as you have Journeyman's Boots
(except in duels), but can save you from unwanted combat outdoors, if
you're lucky enough to re-appear far away enough to Gate. Try doing
it twice in a row, if you're not sure that you're far away enough
(you have MORE than 1 chance out of 2 to increase the distance with
the second cast, that's a simple case geometry involving circles).
The spell will never move you uphill (any upward slope or wall will
block you), so, if you rely on this spell for evasion, stay close to
the hill tops.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Evacuate</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Includes Gate.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">(to be completed)</FONT></I></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Sight spells</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">:
Sphere of Light (lvl 1), Glimpse (lvl 4), Eye of Zomm (lvl 8), Gaze
(lvl 12), Halo of Light (lvl 16), Bind Sight (lvl 16), Heat Sight
(lvl 16), Sight (lvl 20), Magnify (lvl 29), Chill Sight (lvl 39),
Shifting Sight (lvl 39), Plainsight (lvl 55), Eye of Tallon (lvl 57).
Although all these spells have very different mechanics, they all
serve the same purpose: improved sight is seeing ahead or scouting,
and scouting gives you useful information regarding your safety. Some
sight spells are respectable: the light-generating spells are useful
to Erudites and Humans; Bind Sight allows effective long-distance
scouting and inventory of a mob-infested site (in addition to letting
you watch places and mobs which your level doesn't allow you to
approach), but is not effective in all zones (sometimes, the vision
you get is frozen). Eye of Zomm is useful for exploring pits and
falls, detecting pit traps, and finding a mob to lock as a target, so
that you can Bind your Sight to it. The Eye can even open doors, and
its drawback of pulling mobs (which is more or less severe depending
on zones) can sometimes be turned into an advantage. There is a minor
ridiculous trick with the Eye, which you can use if you are grouped
with a Shadowknight or Necromancer currently low on life : the Eye is
not protected against player attacks like other pets are, so, it can
be </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">lifetapped</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Arial"> at no risk (but afterwards you can say "ouch, my eye
!")</FONT></P>
