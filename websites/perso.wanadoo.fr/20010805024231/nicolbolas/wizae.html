         with my file transfer utility, and didn't update my site for
         two months. It is fixed now. I have updated the page on
         Rains (see below) with two important novelties: the fix of
         the so-called "pet bug", and the astonishing observation
         that the resistance depends on the mob's current hit points
         (I must admit I didn't figure it out by myself).</FONT></P>
