<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Columns are targeted range spells, damaging
immediately up to 3 mobs (or 4 with difficulty) in a moderately wide
radius around the target. You will never hurt yourself, unless you
targeted yourself. The cast and recast times (6 seconds) are
moderately long. The resistance pattern is standard, similar to that
of Shocks.</FONT></P>

orange or blue flames around each affected mob, and represent a heavy

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Critic</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Columns are staple AE damage spells, the most
genuine, straightforward, all-purpose, predictable, easy-to-cast AE
damage spells for casual use in group. They also have a
maybe-overpowered application which is "quad-kiting" (see below).
Unfortunately, there is no Column available between levels 34 (Circle
of Force) and 51 (Pillar of Frost), and this is a wide gap.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Columns have good (and relatively even for
their level) strength and damage concentration: that is, compared
with DD, they inflict respectable damage to each mob (they can kill
blue mobs with repeated use), and they provide a damage/mana bonus
versus DD even if they hit only 2 mobs (they don't devastate the mana
bar tickling the mobs, like Al'Kabor spells do). Columns pay off VERY
nicely on 3 mobs.</FONT></P>

one is tempted to continue to use them after the access to a higher
rank of spells is gained. The following table tells how the Columns'

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- In the early fight, pull the additional mob
away from the fighters with the Column damage, and park it with Root
(or, if Bonds of Force was used first, pull the additional mob and
walk it around, possibly testing your skill by means of homing spells
on the main mob while walking the additional one).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Gamble with your damage/mana ratio in easy
multiple-mob fights. Especially, the ratio improvement is much
welcome post-50, because post-50 DD has disappointing damage/mana
(most level 52+ Wizards use Rains instead of Draughts as their main
damage spells, but Columns still compete effectively with Rains on
2-3 mobs).</FONT></P>

"quad-kiting"</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">"Quad" stands for "quadri" (I think), that is,
kiting up to 4 mobs at once. I suspect that quad-kiting was not
possible, or hardly, when the game was first released, because
Columns had a much narrower radius than they have now. The radius was
increased in autumn 1999 (for Columns only) and in early 2000 (for
all AE spells), and, as an outcome, quad-kiting became a reasonable
challenge. When Kunark was released and the strong level 51 Pillar of
Frost became available, some level 51 Wizards with more power than
knowledge, who had never considered AE damage, suddenly went shouting
throughout Norrath that AE spells were tremendous (although they
could have quad-kited with the level 34 Circle of Force when they
were younger). The ability to quad-kite (ability shared between
Druids and Wizards) creates legitimate class envy (many classes can't
even solo one blue mob effectively, let alone 4) and I believe it's
all a big blunder from Verant. I suspect that Al'Kabor spells were
initially given awful damage/mana precisely because their wide radius
created a multiple-kiting threat, and the original designers of the
game didn't want multiple kiting to be possible (the awful
damage/mana ensures that even high-green mobs survive the kiting).
Verant now seems to tolerate that kind of near-abuse, as long as it's
only the feat of a tiny number of players. I find quad-kiting
slightly distasteful, and I also believe that the time and effort to
find and regroup the mobs (and Snare them all while they run) isn't
worth the increased mana-efficiency in most cases; I find single-mob
kiting, on an occasional basis, much more versatile and time-saving
in the long run.</FONT></P>

describing quad-kiting</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">. In short, it is
necessary to find the right mobs, in the right zone. The mobs must be
low-blue or medium-blue; a green mob in the pack will die for no
benefit, and a high-blue mob (or white or yellow or red) will not
die. Timing is more important than for single-mob kiting, and Spirit
of Wolf (or Journeyman's Boots) is a must. The mobs must be tightly
packed, or the Column will miss some, so, they must be all Snared,
and they must also be of the same type, so that they have the same
running speed; running in circles around them to regroup them is
necessary before Snaring. More castings are required to achieve the
kill than when using DD, so, Bonds of Force will tend to have
insufficient duration.</FONT></P>

improvements</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Columns are near-perfect and don't need any
improvement (allthough it can be noted that the level 16 spell is a
bit weak, and that there are no Columns at levels 39, 44 and 49). If
a change comes, it is more likely to be a radius nerf than some form
of improvement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">(To be completed). In short, Magicians have
some Columns, but only at early levels, and Druids have a good array
of Columns, but limited to the outdoors.</FONT></P>
