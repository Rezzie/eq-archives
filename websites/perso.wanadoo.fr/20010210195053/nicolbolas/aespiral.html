<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Al'Kabor spells (including the mysterious
"Ap'Sagor" spell) are targeted range spells, damaging immediately
(and easily) up to 5 mobs in a wide radius around the target. You
will often hurt yourself with the spell at short (or almost-medium)
range. The cast and recast times (9 seconds) are long. The resistance
pattern (except for the level 39 spell) is most probably standard,
similar to that of Shocks, but it might be a bit more favorable (full
damage scored more often) - this is difficult to confirm (at any
rate, Al'Kabor spells don't allow to overcome exceptional resistance
to a particular energy type). The level 39 spell is all-or-nothing,
highly resisted; this is a drawback, with no compensation beside a
split-second stun of questionable value (all-or-nothing spells are
generally acceptable only if their stats are nicely swollen, or if
their non-damage effects are bright).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Al'Kabor spells have a variable pushback effect
which may interrupt spellcasting. Beware that NOT ALL the spells have
this effect, although you will often hear that they have: the level
12 spell doesn't push anything; the level 20 spell pushes players but
not mobs; the level 29 spell has a dubious push; and the level 39
spell has a definite push like Force Shock has. I doubt that the
level 49 spell has any push.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Visual EFX</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Al'Kabor spells create a brief nebulous burst
of blue sparks around each target, and represent only a light trial
for the graphic cards.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Critic</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Al'Kabor spells are extremely lousy cousins of
Columns.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The benefits versus Columns are hardly worth
mentioning: the wider radius, the possibility to hit 1-2 more mobs,
and (maybe) the slightly lesser resistance, are a kind of "guarantee"
that a certain amount of damage will be dealt on the whole, but this
guarantee is not very valuable (if you want "guaranteed" damage, use
DD); and, given how mob hate lists work, you may provoke 3 mobs with
a Column in casual play with tolerable exposure, but provoking 5 mobs
at once with an Al'Kabor spell is probably foolish unless you have a
special plan for surviving. The alleged pushback effect is not very
valuable either, because some PB spells will do the same trick for
much cheaper (although not at range).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The drawbacks versus Columns are heavy: besides
the long cast and recast times, and the possibility to hurt oneself,
Al'Kabor spells are VERY WEAK. Many of them do markedly less damage
per mob than a lower-rank Column, and this alone would make them
unattractive (size matters to a Wizard). Al'Kabor spells also have a
very low damage concentration: you can't hope to kill mobs (even
high-green) with repeated cast, because mana will run out. This
limitation makes sense, being probably meant to prevent the kiting of
multiple mobs; but it should be compensated by other benefits, which
are nowhere to be found. The post-50 Al'Kabor spells have a slightly
better damage concentration, and might allow to kill some
very-low-blue mobs with repeated use, but post-50 Columns still beat
them hands down. In other words, the Al'Kabor spells devastate your
mana bar instead of devastating your enemies. In a different
perspective, they are poor for damage/mana gambling: you need to hit
4 mobs to earn a noticeable damage/mana bonus over DD (or hit 3 mobs,
for the post-50 spells), whereas you would need to hit only 2 mobs
with a Column to earn the same kind of bonus. Al'Kabor spells are a
bad bargain, a mockery better forgotten, and it's a great pity,
because they are the sole Wizard-only AE damage spell line, and we
could have expected it to be the shiniest, instead of being the
lousiest !</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Find herebelow a table of how Al'Kabor spells
compare with lower-rank Columns in damage per mob and mana cost. I
have been comparing the </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">starting

damage done by the Column at the same level (not the starting the

</TABLE><FONT FACE="Arial">This shows that, although the post-50
Al'Kabor spells have improved versus pre-50, it would be a bit
foolish to spend almost double mana for the same damage which Columns
do, unless there is a valuable hidden benefit which nobody was able
to report so far.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Al'Kabor spells have no identified application,
whether casual or specially planned, although many Wizards have tried
to put them to use. The less absurd things which I heard, or can
think of, are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Use the wide radius for an "efficient"
initial pull of a 4-5 mob group; but you'd better pull them in some
safer way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- Cast blindly Shock Spiral of Al'Kabor (the
least expensive spell with pushback against mobs) in a crowd of at
least 3 mobs including casters, for the hazardous benefit of some
spell interruption without mana waste versus DD. But, for that kind
of benefit, you might as well stand in the middle, and use a more
cost-effective PB spell instead, such as Cast Force or
Thunderclap.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- In PvP, cast blindly Fire Spiral of Al'Kabor
(the least expensive spell with pushback against players) in a crowd
of enemy caster/healer players (possibly including some friendly
fighter players, who will be less bothered), for the hazardous
benefit of some spell interruption. Note that you can hit any number
of players that way (the spells have the capacity to hit 5 mobs plus
any number of players). This might be the least grotesque application
of Al'Kabor.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">Requested
improvements</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In summer 2000, I tried to lobby (to no avail)
for the two following improvements for Al'Kabor spells:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- To make them less ridiculous versus Columns:
10% more damage for the mana (for the pre-50 spells), and a mana cost
increment of 75 (instead of 50) for the level 20-29-39 spells.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">- To make them worth playing, besides being
less ridiculous (for all the spells including post-50): either a VERY
short cast time, with quasi-chain-casting (so they would be a mass
taunt / finishoff red button), or a lasting debuff against the energy
type of the same-rank DD.</FONT></P>

post still exists, and add your word: </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"
