<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This text is mostly meant to complement my
other editorial (</FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"><A HREF="wizae.html">Wizard AE spell
guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">), to underline the importance and
place of Area-Effect spells in the Wizard's profile. I also thought
that beginning players should be aware of four common misconceptions
about Wizards. Wizards have the most extreme powers and drawbacks,
and are either very pleasant to play or very frustrating according to
player temper. Read this before investing much time in your Wizard
!</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">1) "Wizards are weak at low
level and powerful at high level".</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Yes and no. "Low level" is to be understood as
level 1-7 only. As a true newbie Wizard (i.e. without the good
mastery of game commands and deluxe equipment which a false newbie
has), you will have a terrible time dying and getting lost repeatedly
(my own piece of advice: spend immediately 3 practice points in
Piercing instead of magical skills; buy a Giant Snake Fang from
another player for 6 gold; and program the /loc command as a social
button and learn how to use it).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At levels 8-11, you have enough mana to start
mastering the Root-Shock routine, and you can afford better gear
(provided that you refrain from buying immediately all the level 8
spells, which are quite expensive), so you improve rapidly.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At level 12, you learn the Shock of Lightning
spell, and you reach your full battle potential. This is the
brightest direct damage spell you ever get, considering that, at
higher levels, you meet the added challenge of swaying through the
creatures' resistances. Also, later, your active battle time tends to
shrink (see paragraph 3).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Levels 20-23 are a trial, because the level 20
direct damage spell is not so good (Force Shock is big but
unreliable; it will be more useful to you later - see paragraph III
in 3rd section). Also, until your late teens, you have melee
capabilities to complement your magical damage, but not so afterwards
(your melee performance becomes ridiculous as creatures grow tougher,
and you will want to meditate when not casting, to reduce downtime.
It took me much time to accept that; I thought I would continue to
melee at higher levels part of the time, wielding a super magical
staff and sweating with my fighter pallies unlike those lazy casters
with pets, but... no). Getting your first Teleports is a kind of
consolation. At this stage, levelling up is much slower.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At level 24, you're back at the peak of your
power. The level 24 direct damage spell is good (a bit smaller than
Force Shock, but reliable), and you've got all your commodity spells
(except the taxi-driving, group-saving Evacuation spells).</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At later levels, there are reports of Wizards
feeling somewhat more powerful when they gain access to level 29 or
34 spells, but nothing really awe-inspiring.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Conclusion: don't look up dreaming to the level
49 Ice Comet spell. If you have a Wizard of level 12 or higher and
you're not satisfied with your performance in combat, learn to like
it, or quit playing your Wizard, because it won't get better.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">2) "The direct damage of
Wizards doesn't shine that much".</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Yes and no. Many Wizards believe that they
should be able to outdamage anybody over the course of a fight; they
complain that the Magicians' direct damage is almost as effective,
and that all casters with pets outdamage Wizards easily. But the
distinctive skill of Wizards is the ability to chain-cast fast and
large damage spells over the course of a few seconds; so we were
told, and so it is; no more and no less. Wizards will not so often
want to chain-cast, because it consumes a lot of mana, and it doesn't
always kill creatures quickly enough to prevent deadly retaliation;
but they can do it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also, relying only on spells after losing their
melee abilities, Wizards are the first affected by the "spell
resistance cap": no chance (or maybe 5%) of affecting with spells
"deep red" creatures which fighters of same level are able to hit
(when a large group fights a "deep red" creature, the Wizard, after
wasting some mana, sits with flaming cheeks while the others do the
job; this is one reason why you should avoid being the junior in your
group, unless Verant alleviates the resistance cap; another reason is
that the group's juniors have a spontaneous taunting effect on
creatures passing by, and you want the tanks to be the taunters, not
you).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A different issue regarding resistances is
that, as the game reaches higher levels, the creatures' resistances
to spells increase so much that scoring full damage becomes
infrequent, and many Wizards feel less and less useful to a group,
and feel dependent from the help of a Shaman or Magician to lower the
resistance of targets to spells. However, this resistance issue is
felt mostly on the Planes (Fear, Hate, etc); a useful quest item from
Temple of Ro (Staff of Temperate Flux) allows Wizards to diminish
somewhat the targets' resistances in the absence of a Shaman or
Magician; the patch of 21 January 2000 has lessened this particular
resistance issue for higher level Wizards (35 and above); and I have
read reports that, even before the patch, Wizards with a higher
Intelligence had much less resistance problems (most casters do not
care to increase their Intelligence beyond 200, because the
additional mana is not worth it; but it is strongly rumored that an
Intelligence of 230 allows the spells to be much less resisted, so
you should start maximizing your Intelligence as soon as you reach
level 20 or so).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Additionally, spells annoy creatures on the
basis of potential damage (the angering effect is the same whether
the damage is fully scored, partly resisted or fully resisted),
whereas weapons annoy creatures on the basis of inflicted damage
only; so, you will often get pounded down even though your spells did
little or no damage, while the fighters are busy elsewhere or try in
vain to shake the creature off you (in this case, your direct damage
"shines" the wrong way).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The picture might seem dark, but it is
important to remember that Wizards have had a very bad reputation as
kill-stealers for a long time (kill-stealing is waiting for someone
to take away 45% of the life of a creature, then finish it off with 2
or 3 spells to steal the experience; this behavior is now a
reportable offence), and Verant felt the need, throughout 1999, to
adjust the game balance in favor of fighting classes. Also, Wizards
have inherited most of the spellcasting legend of traditional
roleplay (they tend to be thought of as "the real thing" if one wants
to play a caster), so I suspect the class is kept slightly
under-attractive technically, to prevent a rush and allow the other
spellcasters to gain respect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is enough matter here to fuel kilometers
of arguing on the forums. In spite of their uneven performance,
Wizards often amaze their comrades with their swiftness, and are
always welcome in a group.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">3) "Wizards can't
solo".</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Yes and no. Wizards are definitely not one of
the best classes for solo play ( for that, you need a character with
a pet - this includes Shamen at high level - or a Druid or Bard), but
there are reports of Wizards being able to solo effectively, with
some limitations. I even heard advice to solo through the "hell"
levels (30, 35, 40 and 45); it's supposed to get you quicker through,
for reasons I'm not sure of.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">First, you may solo well with the Root-Shock
routine as a teenage Wizard (then, after reaching level 20, this
combination becomes less reliable, as creatures get tougher and you
can't count on your melee skills to complement your magical
damage).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Wizard solo above level 20 is generally thought
of as "kiting" as Druids do. That is, you need a borrowed Spirit of
Wolf (or your own Journeyman's Boots) to run faster than the
creature, gain sufficient distance, stop, cast, then run again. This
is possible only outdoors. The level 29 spell Bonds of Force is
supposed to slow down the movement of a group of creatures, so you
could expect not to need Spirit of Wolf anymore, but it's not as
reliable as the Druid spell "snare" (the mana cost is 75 i.e. a bit
high, you may affect yourself by mistake with the spell, and the
duration is said to be rather short). However, the main limitation of
"kiting", for a Wizard, is the large downtime. When a Druid runs
kiting a creature, he or she is not wasting time: he or she is
allowing the Damage-Over-Time spells to give their best efficiency.
When a Wizard runs kiting a creature, he or she is </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Arial">only</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> regaining distance
between two Shocks (not scoring any extra damage, and not regaining
mana either), so, the downtime of running is simply added to the
downtime of meditating (I prefer to cast my spells comfortably on a
creature kept busy by fighters, and to meditate between two
castings). One can also fear that, for each 9 creatures killed solo,
one will have a good chance to kill the Wizard if something goes
wrong (mana runs out, creature scores a few stuns) and the experience
gained is negated. I had a report of a Wizard using Column spells in
solo (see my </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><A HREF="wizae.html">Wizard AE
spell guide </A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">) to kite 3 or 4 creatures
at a time and gain a damage/mana bonus reducing downtime (this
requires identifying the proper zone and proper creatures to do it
without too much danger).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Another way to solo, for a Wizard, is to bully
smaller spellcasting creatures. The meleeing creatures are the
hardest to kill (many hit points, and they hit hard), whereas the
spellcasting creatures are softer (although they may pose problems to
fighter players, who can't resist spells as well as Wizards can). Not
so many Shocks are needed to kill a spellcasting creature, and, in
the meantime, the creature will waste time casting weak spells
instead of hitting. Depending on your level, creatures such as Gnoll
High Shamen, Evil Eyes, and the like, will be relatively easy solo
experience with no need to run.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#AF0000">4) "Playing a Wizard is
boring".</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Yes and no. The Wizard class is
straightforward; it's the magical equivalent of the Warrior class, at
least at the lower levels. If some are happy playing a Warrior, some
can also be happy playing a Wizard. After losing their melee
abilities, Wizards become very mana-dependent, and meditation time is
dull; but spellcasting time is intense, and meditation is often an
opportunity to socialize or ponder.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At intermediate levels and high levels, Wizards
just can't be as active as most other players. If Wizards try to keep
up with the others, they run out of mana in less than a minute, and
are excluded from group operations for up to eight minutes afterwards
(full meditation time). Wizards are meant, apparently, to watch the
pulse of the group and act as an insurance: they stay idle 80% of the
time when the rest of the group can do without them, and they are
active 20% of the time (stepping in without losing a single second),
to maintain group cohesion by finishing off fleeing creatures, to
curb opposition when the group tends to suffer heavier damage, and to
Evacuate the group when it is likely to be overwhelmed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One can wonder if the experience drained from
group operations by higher level Wizards during their idle time is
worth their contribution during their active time. Still, without a
Wizard, a group needs both a Druid and an Enchanter (or Bard) to have
both Evacuation and opposition regulation. Evacuation is very
valuable to a group. Enchanters and Bards (i.e. Mesmerizers, see
paragraph A.2 in 3nd section) are better than Wizards for opposition
regulation, but the Wizard's way of regulating opposition (blasting)
is different and complementary. However, both Evacuation and
opposition regulation are support functions (such as the abilities of
healers, Enchanters and Bards), and Wizards possibly don't want to be
support characters (they signed for being magical fighters). So,
Wizards may be reluctant to accept their "pulse-watching" role, may
not want to be loved for Evacuation, and may even find Evacuation a
boring privilege (self-only Teleport makes you free as the wind; not
so Evacuation; Evacuation is a Cleric's job). That's the kind of
things Wizards must learn to like: becoming more of a support
character when growing older (although they still remain part-time
magical fighters). I once read that Wizards functioned as "aggressive
Clerics"; I couldn't put it better. Actually, Wizards will feel more
effective if they start thinking "support" early in their
career.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Higher level Wizards may feel a "magical
fighter" again sometimes, when they act as the bodyguard of the
group's healer, or when they make a constructed use of area-effect
spells (see my </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><A HREF="wizae.html">Wizard
AE spell guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">), or when they act as
"magical tank" against spellcasting creatures (Wizards probably have
the best resistances, and, if they increase their resistances with
their self-only buffs and other buffs from Clerics and Shamen, they
can face without fear spells which would take down a fighter quickly;
so, against a casting creature, the Wizard may purposedly lead the
fight so that the fighters can hit at the enemy without being burned
away).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Of course, a player who wants to keep active as
often as possible should choose a fighter, and a player who needs a
multi-purpose array of spells to be happy should choose another type
of spellcaster. But the diversity of Wizard spells is decent enough
to fill the eight memorization slots. Although Shock and Root are the
meat and drink of a fighting Wizard, a handful of playable
Area-Effect spells add much to combat thrill.</FONT></P>
