Remember:<br>
'----' means this information is KNOWN by me. You may ASK me for this information as part 
of an information trade (see specifics below).<p>
'???' means this information is NOT KNOWN to me. You may GIVE me this information as part 
of an information trade (see specifics below).
This info will NOT be made public, but may be given to other players as a reward for their submissions.<p>
'?Pub?' means I do NOT know this information. You may GIVE me this information as part 
of an information trade (see specifics below). This info WILL be made public for all to see.<p>
'Not Avail' means this information is KNOWN by me. You may NOT ask for this information. 
It will be given out as rewards for special web site contests, and revealed publicly at a 
later time.<p>
All rewards are optional!<p>
If a screenshot is required, that means it is required for you to get your zone/mob prizes. I will 
accept items without screenshots but you will not get any zone or mob locations as a reward.

<hr width='100%'>

<b>If you have a new item</b>:<br>
Send me an item email (by clicking the link above). Make sure your subject is:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp EQ-Item (plus the name of your item)<br><br>
If you do not use this as your subject it will take me longer to get to your submission. 
A screenshot is <b>REQUIRED</b> for all new items.  If you do not submit a screenshot of 
the new item, I will not email you back with the information you requested. If several 
people email me the same item before I have had a chance to update the page, I will only 
reward the first person to submit the item. This holds true for all submissions.<p>

Please see the section on <a href="#SS">SCREENSHOTS</a> for tips on the fastest way to send screenshots to me.<p>

Note: You DO NOT have to send the zone and mob location of your item. The new item on its 
own is enough to initiate an information trade. The zone and mob location, if submitted, 
will be treated as a separate submission with a separate reward (see below).<p>

<b>Reward</b> for a new item:<br>
You may ask for zone and mob locations of any THREE items that have '-----' listed for their 
zone and/or mob location. If the zone is listed but the mob location is not, I will give 
you the mob location but this does count as one of your three items.

<hr width='100%'>

<b>If you have an item that I am missing information on</b>:<br>
You may initiate an information trade with me on any item listed that has a '??' unknown 
statistic. This does <b>NOT include zone and mob location</b> (see the next section for 
information on that). The submission information is the same as for submitting a new item. Use the same subject 
line for your email ('EQ-Item and name of your item'), and a screenshot is <b>REQUIRED</b>.<p>

These submissions include items which have unknown armor class, statistical bonuses, weight, 
magical status, classes permitted, and races permitted.<p>

Please see the section on <a href="#SS">SCREENSHOTS</a> for tips on the fastest way to send screenshots to me.<p>

<b>Reward</b> for existing item information:<br>
You may ask for zone and mob location of ONE item that has '-----' listed for its zone and/or 
mob location.

<hr width='100%'>

<b>If you know the zone and mob location of an item</b>:<br>
Submit this information in the same manner as you would the above two submissions. Be sure 
to have your email subject read 'EQ-Item and name of your item'. For obvious reasons, a screenshot is <b>NOT</b> 
required.<p>

Please only submit zone and mob info on items you yourself have acquired. I would prefer NOT 
to receive rumors on items ('My friend's roommate's brother said he knew someone that saw someone who had a picture 
of someone with this item').<p>

NOTE: You MUST tell me both the zone location and mob identity to receive your reward. If 
both are unknown to me, and you email only the zone location (or only the mob identity), you 
will not receive your reward.<p>

This submission type carries a reward separate from an existing item info submission. As an 
example, suppose I have an item, and I do not know the mob identity for the item, nor the 
weight and classes permitted of the item. You send me a screenshot of the item, and tell me 
who drops it. In this case, you get 2 rewards, one for completing the item information I 
was missing, and a second reward for the zone/mob location of the item.<p>

I will verify these locations personally or through my in-game connections, so it may take a few days 
for you to receive your reward email.<p>

<b>Reward</b> for the zone location or mob identity for an item:<br>
You may ask for zone and mob location of ONE item that has '------' listed for its zone and/or 
mob location.

<hr width='100%'>

<b>If you see a mistake on one of the listed items</b>:<br>
Submit the info as usual with your email subject reading EQ-Item and the name of the item. For mistakes, screenshots 
are not required, but they are appreciated. Many items will be missing Lore status with the 
recent change of many non-lore items to lore items; these changes do not require a screenshot at all.<p>

There is no reward for correcting a mistake made except that you have made this site better than before!<p>

<b>Screenshot Information</b>
<p>This section will help you send screenshots to me.<br>
While playing Everquest, you can take a screenshot of your current screen by pressing the 
DASH (-) key on your <b>numeric keypad</b> (not the one at the top of the keyboard by the 
number keys). For submitting items, you will want to have the icon of the item visible 
somewhere on screen (for example, having your inventory open if you are wearing the item).<p>

For most submissions, you will also want to be examining the items statistics, which means 
holding down your right mouse button over the item AS you press the screenshot key.<p>

Everquest then places the screenshot into your everquest folder on your hard drive, under 
the name of EQ00000.bmp, EQ00001.bmp, etc. The highest number screenshot is your most recent 
screenshot. The .bmp format that everquest saves images in is very high quality, but it also 
takes up a lot of disk space (an entire megabyte for each picture!). You CAN send these 
screenshots to me, but they will take a while to upload onto your mail server.<p>

A better idea is to modify the screenshot first. I personally recommend <a href='http://www.jasc.com/download.html'>Paint Shop Pro</a>
if you don't already own a graphics program. This program will allow you to save your picture files in a smaller 
format. You can download a free version of it <a href='http://www.jasc.com/download.html'>here</a>.<p>

The easiest thing you can do, is to simply save the full screen picture in a smaller format. 
.jpg or .gif are two easy formats to use. You will want to open up the EQ0000.bmp file with 
the graphic program of your choice, then SAVE AS under any name, in the JPEG or GIF format. 
These files are a lot smaller and will really reduce your emailing time.<p>

If you are comfortable using your paint program, and know how to cut, paste, and crop images, 
you can also send me item info using the 'EQLizer' format. These images are much smaller and 
are in the exact format I need them. Here is an example of an EQLizer type image:<p>
<div align=center><img src='sample.jpg'></div><br>

If you are unsure how to get the item icon onto the description panel, just send me the full-sized 
image, in either .bmp or .jpg/.gif format.
