<b>Note</b>-Most of you will be able to figure out the abbreviations used.  The only part that may 
be confusing is the Magical Effects abbreviations. <br>Click <a href='#magef'>here</a> to jump to that section.
<br><hr width="100%">

<b>Item Name</b>-This is the name of the item as it appears in the game.  If the item 
name is followed by a number, this indicates which melee slots the item is restricted to.
For example, Crystalline Blade (1) means that this weapon can ONLY be held in your main melee slot 
(not your secondary dual wield hand).  The Shield of the Slain Unicorn(2) can ONLY be worn
in your secondary hand, even though it is also a weapon.
<br><hr width="100%">

<b>Zone Location</b>-This is the name of the zone where the item is found.  If multiple zones
are listed, this indicates that the item may be found in any of these zones. <p>
Some commons zone abbreviations are: Bef(Befallen), MM(Mistmoore), Perma(Permafrost),RE(RunnyEye Citadel)<p>
'--------' means the zone location is known by me and may be told to you through email as part
of an information trade.  Please see <a href='Submit.html''>Submission Rules</a> for details.<p>
'???' means the zone location is not known by me.  You can initiate an information trade
with me if you know the zone this item is found in.  Please see <a href='Submit.html''>Submission Rules</a> for details.
This info will NOT be made public, but may be given to other players as a reward for their submissions.<p>

information. This info WILL be made public for all to see.<p>

information will be given away during special contests of this web site or for special purposes only.
<br><hr width="100%">

<b>Mob Identity</b>-This is the name or type of creature that drops the item.  If the item 
is the reward from the quest, the beginning creature or npc for the quest is listed.  Please 
note that most items are NOT dropped every time you kill the listed creature (they require 
multiple kills to get the item). Complete quest solutions, only the beginning npc, or key figure, in 
the quest. For complete spoilers, check out <a href='everquest.gamestats.com' target='_blank'>Allakhazam's Site</a><p>

<br><hr width="100%">

<b>Level</b><br>
- The number is the *average* level a group of 6 should be to be able to get the item.<br>
- This number takes into account: a. the difficulty of the monster, b. how difficult it is to get to, 
c. how many monsters you must fight at once to kill the monster<br>
- Numbers above 50 tell how many GROUPS of level 50's are required (in multiples of 50). Therefore, 100 means 
2 groups of 50's, 150 means 3 groups of 50's, and 200 (the current maximum) means 4 *or more* groups of level 50's.<br>
- Any item that can be bought or made has a Level of 1, which means your level is not a factor in getting the item.<br>
- This is a new idea, so I'm sure I will be off on many of the numbers..remember, this is the average level for an entire 
group of 6 to get the item *perhaps with difficulty*.<p>

This new feature has been added to the search engine, so you can search for items based on their level.
<br><hr width='100%'>

<b>Armor Class</b>-This is the armor class (AC) of the item.  All items have positive AC's. 
Please note that depending upon your character's agility score, the armor class of your character 
may be raised by more than the item's base AC.<p>
'--' means the item has NO armor class.<p>
'??' means that I do not know the armor class of this item. You can initiate an information 
trade with me by sending me a screenshot of the item. Please see <a href='Submit.html''>Submission Rules</a> for details.
<br><hr width="100%">

<b>Damage/Delay (Dm/Dl)</b>-This replaces the Armor Class category for weapons. The damage 
refers to the listed damage rating for the weapon. Note that you can do considerably more 
damage to a foe than its listed damage rating. On average, with good weapons skills, a character 
will be able to hit monsters for <b>double</b> a weapons damage rating. They delay corresponds 
to the amount of time that must pass before you can swing the weapon. The higher the delay, the 
longer the wait.<p>
'??' means that I do not know the damage or delay of this item. You can initiate an information 
trade with me by sending me a screenshot of the item. Please see <a href='Submit.html''>Submission Rules</a> for details.
<br><hr width="100%">

<b>Magical Bonuses or Effects</b>-This indicates all magical bonuses, effects, and powers 
an item may have.<p>
'--' means the item has NO bonuses or effects.<br>
'??' means that I do not know of the effects or bonuses for the item.  You can initiate an 
information trade with me by sending me a screenshot of the item. Please see <a href='Submit.html''>Submission Rules</a> for details.<p>
<b>Statistical Bonuses</b>-These bonuses affect your characters statistics in some way.  Please
 note that these items have positive bonuses (which help your character), or negative bonuses 
(which harm your character).<p>
These are the abbreviations used:<p>
<table border = 1>
<tr><td>Str = Strength</td><td>Agi = Agility</td><td>Wis = Wisdom</td><td>Cha = Charisma</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sta = Stamina</td><td>Dex = Dexterity</td><td>Int = Intelligence</td><td align = center>-</td></tr>
</table><p>
<table border = 1>
<tr><td>Fr = Fire Resist</td><td>Ps = Poison Resist</td><td>Mg = Magic Resist</td><td>HP = Hit Points</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cd = Cold Resist</td><td>Ds = Disease Resist</td><td align = center>-</td><td>MP = Magic Points</td></tr>
</table><p>
<a name='magef'></a>
<b>Magical Effects</b>-This is any other effect or bonus an item might have that is not directly 
related to your statistics (listed above).<p>
In many cases, an items effect will be similar or identical to one of the existing character spells. In 
other cases, the effect may be unique to the item.  In these cases the effect is described or it is listed
 as the character spell it is most similar to.<p>
If an item effect has a number next to it, this indicates the number of charges that the item contains. 
For many items, once these charges are used they are never replenished.  A few items have small quests or 
npcs that will recharge particular items.<br>
Example: an item that has an effect of Waterbreath(10) has 10 charges of waterbreathing attached to it.<p>
At item which has a zero next to its effect means it has infinite charges of the effect.<br>
Example: Journeyman Boots with an effect of Speed(0) have infinite charges<p>
An item which has NO number next to the effect means it is an inherent property of the item.  As such, 
you do not ever use charges to receive the affect, as long as the item is worn (or in some cases, in your 
inventory), you will receive the benefits of the effect.
<br><hr width="100%">

<b>Item Weight</b>-This is the item's weight. This is particularly important for monk characters, but 
all characters should be sure not to exceed their maximum carrying capacity (as determined by their 
current strength).  Doing so results in statistical penalties to the character and decreased combat 
effectiveness.<p>
Some armor items come in different sizes (<a href='#Small'>Small</a>, <a href='#Medium'>Medium</a>, 
and <a href='#Large'>Large</a>. In these cases, you will see three weights separated by a / symbol. 
The first number is the small size weight, the second the middle size weight, and the third number 
the large size weight.<p>
'?' means that I do not know the weight for a certain size of the item. You can initiate an 
information trade with me by sending me a screenshot of the correctly sized item. Please see <a href='Submit.html''>Submission Rules</a> for details.<p>

Weapons have an additional component to weight, and that is range (on weapons, Weight becomes 
Wt/Rng). If a weapon has a range, you can put it into your Thrown slot and still gain its 
magical bonuses. You can also throw the weapon at a creature in the same manner as you would 
use a bow. Weapons thrown in this manner are destroyed after throwing them.<p>
'??' means that I do not know the weight or range of this item. You can initiate an information 
trade with me by sending me a screenshot of the item. Please see <a href='Submit.html''>Submission Rules</a> for details.
<br><hr width="100%">

<b>Magical Status</b>-This is a special category which tells you several important facts about
 the item.<p>
<b>Y/N</b>-If an item is Magical, a Y (for Yes) will appear; if not, a N (for No) will appear. This is 
mainly useful for weapons (magical creatures can only be hit by magical weapons). If using 
Hand to Hand combat, magical creatures can only be hit if you are wearing magical gloves.<p>
<b>L</b>-The presence of the L (Lore) symbol means that your character can only have ONE of this particular
 item at a time.  If your character is wearing a Lore item, has a Lore item in inventory, or 
has a Lore item in his/her bank, looting this item a second time will cause the second item to 
disappear.<p>
<b>NT</b>-This is the NoTrade symbol. If an item is classified NoTrade (also sometimes listed as 
NoDrop ingame), this item can NOT be sold to stores, and can NOT be traded to other players. Therefore,
 if an item is NoDrop/NoTrade, only allow party members to loot this item if they can use it for the 
item cannot be traded afterwards.<p>

 trade with me by sending me a screenshot of the item. Please see <a href='Submit.html''>Submission Rules</a> for details.
