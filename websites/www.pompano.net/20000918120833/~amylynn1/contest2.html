Welcome to the new Map Contest!<p>

This map contest is <b>ONLY</b> for the following zones:<br>
Mistmoore<br>
Permafrost<br>
Solusek A<br>
Solusek B<br>
Lower Guk<br>
Kedge Keep<br>
Plane of Fear<p>

The way this works is simple. Just send in the best maps you have made for any of the above zones.<p>

Maps <b>MUST</b> be complete.  They do not have to show spawn points (though that is appreciated), but they 
must show a <b>complete floor plan</b> of the entire zone. Please do not submit maps that have only one half 
or one quarter of the dungeon mapped.<p>

Whomever submits the best map for each zone will win EIGHT (8) item locations of their choice. Winners will be 
picked whenever I have received a few maps for a particular zone.<p>

Once a winner is picked for a zone, you can STILL win this contest by submitting a BETTER map for that particular zone.<p>


I reserve the right to change the map in any way.  Maps will not be posted initially, but will be posted 
at a later date.<p>

When submitting the map, please include the 8 items you'd like to know about (in case you win!)<p>
