Welcome to the new daily Humor Contest!<p>

The way this works is simple: send in your funniest pic, WITH caption, and each day I'll choose the 
funniest pic of the bunch!<p>

The winner will receive TWO free item locations. A new winner will be chosen each day (no winner if no 
humor pix submitted of course). <p>

I reserve the right to change the caption if I can think of something funnier to say.  Any pic that is 
funny will make it into the <a href='Humor.html'>Humor</a> section, but there will only be one winner each day.<p>

When submitting the pix, please include the 2 items you'd like to know about (in case you win!)<p>

You can only submit ONE pic per day for the contest.  Good Luck!<p>

<b>NEW</b><br>
The new 'Humor Champion' will remain champion until an 
even funnier picture unseats it! A Humor Champion will not be awarded each day, but only for pictures of exceptional humor...If your picture becomes 
a humor champion, you win FIVE item locations instead of the regular TWO item locations for a humor winner.
