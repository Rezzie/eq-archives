This is a Visual Basic Program.

If you have a newer version of these files, make sure to back up your newer files before replacing them with these:<br><br>

<a href="../wa/msvb6dll.zip">msvb6dll.zip</a> (MSVBVM60.DLL - 687 kb)<br>
<a href="sysfiles.zip">sysfiles.zip</a> (8 Support Files - 700 kb)<p><br>
