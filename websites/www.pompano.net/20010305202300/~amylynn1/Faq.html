<i>Q: What do all these symbols mean in your item lists?</i><p>
A: The <a href='Legend.html'>Legend</a> page has all abbreviations used on the item sheets. If this does not answer 
all your questions, please send <a href='Submit.html'>me feedback</a><p><br>

<i>Q: I used the search engine, and the results came out really weird. What did I do wrong?</i><p>
A: Maybe nothing. The search engine is new and there may still be some bugs left in it. If you get 
really weird or unusual results, just send me <a href='mailto:eqitem@l-and-g.com?Subject=Feedback'>Feedback</a> 
on it, and include what kind of search you were doing. I'll fix it as quickly as possible.<p><br>

<i>Q: Why is your web site so plain? There aren't even any graphics?</i><p>
A: This was done on purpose. I am hoping for a lot of traffic for this site, and I did 
not want any graphics, java apps, animations, etc. to slow down the loading of these 
pages.<p><br>

<i>Q: I really really need to know where xxx item is! I promise I won't tell anyone will 
you please give me the item location?</i><p>
A: At this time, no.  There are many many items still to be discovered, both high and low 
level, for me to give out information at this time.  I would much rather trade information 
(see <a href='Submit.html'>Submission Rules</a>) in order to improve the site first. Later on this policy will change 
more and more items are found. There will also be contests run on this site so by winning 
these you can also get item information.<p><br>

<i>Q: I never find new items! This is unfair that all the high levels can get your info 
but not me! What do I do?</i><p>
A: There are many low level items waiting to be found.  Also, remember that there are many 
<b>LISTED</b> items which are missing bits of information. You can trade info by sending in 
screenshots of these items (see <a href='Submit.html'>Submission Rules</a> for details).<p><br>

<i>Q: I have lost all my items due to a bug; I have lost money/items/characters and the GM's 
won't help me! Should I send you email? Is there anything you can do?</i><p>
A: I'm sorry I cannot help with this in any way. Most of the major EQ news sites get these 
posts frequently, and I'm sure Verant is aware of the problem.
