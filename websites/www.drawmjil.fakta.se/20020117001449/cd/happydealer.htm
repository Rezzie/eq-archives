      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">I 
        thought I'd write this brief guide based on what I know and have come 
        across so far. Its really for those of you that have never grouped with 
        an enchanter before.<br>
        <br>
        Firstly you'll know that we are designed to be crowd control. Although 
        other classes can undertake this role to a certain extent (from what I 
        hear) the chanter is the numero uno at it with her line of mezzing spells.<br>
        <br>
        Lets assume we have a full groups consisting of tanks a healer and a couple 
        of nukers and were in a nasty place like Paw or similar where the chances 
        are that we will get a pull of 3-5 doggies. If u have a good puller or 
        one that can do feign death pulls they normally reduce the incoming mobs.<br>
        <br>
        The first thing you all do is assign a ASSIST key to the main puller (sometimes 
        a tank???? if the puller stays down? not sure). The key here is that everyone 
        is targeting the same mob. Depending on the numbers that have come in 
        and location I will do an area mezz (if its only one or two extra I may 
        opt for the individual mezz but this depends on how much dmg is being 
        dished out) If I'm too close then an AOE mezz will mezz me and I will 
        normally inform the group that this has happened so u can act accordingly. 
        This will hit every thing that is bashing on the tank/puller. Now this 
        is usually only a certain percentage successful and will do one of two 
        things to the mobs that aren't being hit (and they wont be because everyone 
        is using assist!). One, they will just ignore me if I'm out of agro range 
        or turn on me which is what we want and is the norm. Once they are on 
        me I will attempt to gain control of them by stunning and mezzing. Once 
        I have them mezzed I will Tashan them (I try and do this first as it decreases 
        my resists to spells but depends on situation) this reduces their resistance 
        to magic and most if not all of my spells are magic based. After which 
        I will Tepid Deeds them to slow there attack speed down (just in case 
        the mezz breaks and increases my chances of getting them off me by allowing 
        me to cast). That's normally it, I will then keep them mezzed till they 
        are ready for bashing. Sounds simple but can be damned hard work at time. 
        One thing to you tanks. If they mobs are stacked on you and I mezz them 
        then take a few steps back so pull the mob apart so I can target the mezzed 
        ones.<br>
        <br>
        When they are ready for bashing it is most important that they are taunted 
        before the mezz is broken. This doesn't always work but if this isn't 
        done then they will go straight for me and even the cleric. Sometimes 
        I will root them if I know the mezz is just about to be broken but not 
        always as I'm busy medding or keeping the others out of the way.<br>
        <br>
        That's all well and good but it don't always go that way. What can happen 
        is the extra's don't get mezzed in time (resists etc) and they agro off 
        the tanks and pullers onto the cleric (normally) or nuker. Now is very 
        natural to start defending yourself but DON'T. By all means root them 
        if I cant get to you but don't start hitting them or nuking or worst put 
        a DOT on them. At some point I will get to it and there is nothing worse 
        than me mezzing only to find it breaks instantly because someone has twatted 
        it or a DOT is doing its work. This takes real faith in me and your cleric 
        but I have to have 100% faith in the cleric as I will, along with the 
        cleric become numero uno on the death list.<br>
        <br>
        Never ever help me unless I ask for it. Again, its common nature to help 
        a groupie who is getting a real bashing but I will eventually (not always) 
        get the mob under control and as above nothing worse than finally mezzing 
        it only for it to be broken and to continue bashing me. When I do call 
        for help and I will then I need someone who can dish out enough damage 
        to agro it off me or root it for me. Wizards are good at this, what I 
        need is for you to agro it onto u (needs faith again) in order that I 
        can cast on it but DON'T DOT IT, I will get it mezzed and then u can resume 
        on the assisted mob.<br>
        <br>
        I will charm mobs when the pull is bad or we look like were going to get 
        a hiding. Charm lasts at my level anything from a few seconds to 9 minutes. 
        Sometime when groupies have been guilty of switching targets its the only 
        method I have to get the mob under our control but I shouldn't have to 
        do this. I will if I can tell you that a mob is charmed (now I'm using 
        CTRL and 1 - 8 I have spare macro slots). If the charm breaks he will 
        come straight onto me, again the above rules apply I may mezz or recharm. 
        If at the end of the battle the charm is still running then I will break 
        it but the tanks must be taunting it as it will be straight onto me (rooting 
        would be good if I can get a safe distance away from the mob) but I will 
        inform you that the charm is about to be broken.<br>
        <br>
        The main points to follow are never ever switch targets, no matter who 
        is beating on you I will come to your aid and the cleric will be keeping 
        an eye on you I'm sure (shout for help if you need it) but the moment 
        you switch targets then the chances are I will not mezz it as I will be 
        wasting my mana and I will leave you to get on and die.<br>
        <br>
        Only help me if I ask for it.<br>
        <br>
        If I die its normally a good sign that the cleric is OOM or to busy keeping 
        the tanks alive and things are out of control and u should be looking 
        to get those legs in action. If I sense that it is going out of control 
        then I will tell u to zone. Once I'm gone u have no crowd control and 
        the cleric will normally be the next to fall. I have no worries about 
        sacrificing my life for the sake of the group (happens on the rare occasions, 
        as it did last night in Paw) but if I die and the remaining 5 get out 
        then that's cool, watch out for the warning signs.<br>
        <br>
        I'm still learning how to play my class but this is what I've learnt so 
        far.<br>
        <br>
        Especially as you start to reach your twenties when places like Paw and 
        Cazic become attractive zones (and u get better exp in dungeons) you must 
        work with your chanter if you have one (cant imagine life without one!).<br>
        <br>
        I still have to educate people on the above especially those solo classes.<br>
        <br>
        One other point for you pet classes. If your pet gets out of control then 
        DITCH it. Pets are the worst offenders at switching targets. If you can 
        do without one then don't use one but those extra pair of hands do come 
        in useful especially when the mob is a deep red to you and casting on 
        it is like tipping your mana down the drain.<br>
        <br>
        I may sound a bit bossy but I have to be, otherwise I will die pretty 
        quickly and so will the group.<br>
        <br>
        If anyone else has some tips or experiences then please pop them down.<br>
