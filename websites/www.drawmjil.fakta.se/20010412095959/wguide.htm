          <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>I decided to write this document
          since I could not find a Ogre Warrior specific guide any ware on the
          internet. You might say -'Bah!, a guide for Ogre warriors, what's more
          to it than bash everything you see!'</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>I think there is allot more to it.
          I've missed a good guide when starting out so I will here try to give the
          Ogre warrior a good start in life.</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>When you start out, first go find
          your guild master if you feel for it. It will give you a chance to look
          around in the place which you will call home for the next 8 levels,
          Oggok. There is a lot of maps for Oggok, and I wont go into detail,
          since it's very good practice to find the way yourself. My advice is
          NOT to spend any practice points at this time. There is allot of
          different opinions on this, but mine is that practice points should go
          into higher level skills. Your skills will eventually 'cap' anyway.
          Ogre skills take along time to cap out, since we lack allot in intelligence
          which is the ability which has to do with skill advancement.
          The other reason for not putting practice points on skills yet is that
          you start out with a one hand slashing weapon. My opinion is that an
          Ogre SHOULD have a BIG 2 hand slashing weapon as primary choice. This
          opinion is mostly based on role-playing arguments, Big warriors use big
          weapons. So, save your practice point until you have decided which type of weapon you are gonno use as your primary
          weapon, then you can
          boost that.</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>So, you found your guild master, you
          have given him the not, now it's time to bash some monsters. When you
          exit Oggok there is a road. Follow it for a couple of meters. It will
          split up. Follow the road to the left. You till here some to a place
          with two huts and 2 Ogres. These fellow cant be spoke to, traded with
          or anything else. I think they are just 'there'. After that the road
          will split up once again. Turn right here. Now you are at, in my
          opinion, the perfect warrior hunting zone for level 1 to 5. Just go
          out bash everything in sight until you reach level 4. Note that once
          you reach level 4 you will not get free food and a free weapon when
          you die, so remember where your corpse is. Smash Froglock toads and other
          critters up until 5. Now you feel a bit more brave. The problem
          for a fighter is hit points recovery, this is really not a problem yet,
          but will be more of an issue the higher up in level you advance. From
          6 and onwards I recommend the other side of the bridge. You exit from
          Oggok and follow the road straight ahead until you reach the bridge.
          There is usually a guard here which means that there is safe to rest on
          the bridge. Always sit down when resting, this doubles you HP
          regeneration. Follow the road from the bridge and bash more bigger
          monsters. Be aware, you loose XP when you die from level 5 and
          onwards. It could be a good idea to group from now on, maybe with a
          shaman who has healing capabilities. As you now have started to notice,
          2 hp per 'blipp' when sitting down is not much a regeneration
          capability.</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Grouping becomes more and more
          important the higher you advance in levels, Drawmjil is now level 16,
          and he just cannot solo anymore. Ok, I can kill a blue mob, but then I
          have to sit down for 5 minutes and rest. When grouping with a cleric
          of shaman you can have a very good tempo when hunting for XP. As you
          advance in level you can try then Swamp outside Grobb to. It's a bit
          hard to find, and be aware of the bard which is located in the
          south-west area, he will whack you quick.</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>When you are at approximately
          level 8 or something its a good idea to 'move'. I'm binded in Neriak,
          the home of the darkelfes, which is one of the few cities which we
          unpopular Ogres can really live in. This gives you access to Nektulos
          forest which can be hunted until level 10, and then east and west
          commonlands in which Drawmjil hunted up to level 13. Be sure to ask a
          shaman to help you with a SOW for the long run, and when you arrive,
          ask a kind magicuser to bind you in Neriak.</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>At last some other words of
          advice. Equipment, you should try to save as lots of money as you can.
          What you could aim for as early in life as possible is a complete
          Leather amour, which is quite affordable until you find something
          better. Leather is also the first amour which makes you look
          'not-naked'. Another thing is to look on you message log, sometimes
          nice highlevel characters give stuff away to newbies, usually on the
          bridge, be quick to accept these gifts.</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Well, good luck and happy hunt as
          Drawmjil says, being an Ogre is a though business since practically
          all NPC's hate you, but it's great to be strong and big, or Strongest
          and Biggest, especially compared to these Ogre-wannabie-trolls.</b></font></p>
