        Drift will accept new members from lvl 10 upwards. All potential members

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><b><u>GUILD 
        RULES</u></B><br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Recruitment</u></B><br>
        <br>
        While we accept members from lvl 10 upwards we are in the main a mid lvl 
        guild. Our parent guild Old Continent has many more high lvl players for 
        the large 'epic' events. We generally advise our members to move to Old 
        Continent at lvl 45, however this is in no way enforced members may stay 
        in Continental Drift until lvl 60 if they so wish.<br>
        <br>
        All potential members must fill in the members application procedure (at 
        the bottom of this page).<br>
        <br>
        This will then be put on our board for member approval where we will discuss 
        your application for a few days. Existing members are given the chance 
        to vote on your application, when you receive 4 votes your membership 
        will be approved.<br>
        <br>
        The way most people are invited into Continental Drift is if you know 
        us or our parent guild Old Continent. Friends want to play with friends. 
        So if you know some of us the approval and the trial period are mostly 
        a formality.<br>
        <br>
        As a new member you are obligated to register an account on EZBoard for 
        communication. All guild information will be published on the Message 
        boards. You are also obligated to participate on the boards. You must 
        add your name to the Current Members section. Failure to do so will result 
        in you being removed from the guild.<br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Rules of Conduct</u></B><br>
        <br>
        This section could just be a reference to the everquest site. In short&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        * Don’t train people on purpose,&nbsp;<br>
        * Don’t KS,&nbsp;<br>
        * Don’t give yourself and Continental Drift a bad name with rude behaviour 
        in trades OOC or Shouts.<br>
        * Don’t bicker about camp sites, but state your right.<br>
        * Don’t let your first action be to /petition and call a GM if any of 
        the Rules of Conduct are broken by others causing harassment to you. Seek 
        diplomacy, call in friends or guild officers, then as a last resort /petition.&nbsp;<br>
        * Many, many problems can be solved by the /ignore command.<br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Guild Chat</u></B><br>
        <br>
        The guild chat is our common line of communication when online. Here is 
        how we can use it:<br>
        <br>
        * SOCIAL: Chat and joke, any normal socialising.<br>
        <br>
        * HELP: Request help for ports, price checks. We are here to help each 
        other. However do NOT see this as a service which you at any time can 
        request and expect delivered.<br>
        <br>
        * IGNORE: You are of course allowed to turn off guild chat if you are 
        in a place where you do not need disturbance. Expect people to do this 
        on raids.<br>
        <br>
        * RAIDS: The guild say may be "borrowed" by a majority of people on a 
        raid where fast communication is needed. If so, please try and keep socialising 
        and jokes to a minimum.<br>
        <br>
        * SILENCE: The guild leader or any officer can call "Guild say SILENCE". 
        This basically means that information necessary for us all to hear are 
        being relayed and just for a short period we need not to be interrupted. 
        </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">*MOTD: 
        The guild MOTD is displayed</span><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"> 
        each time you log onto a character that is a CD member. It will often 
        contain important information that the whole guild needs to know so please 
        read this.<br>
        <br>
        <b><u>The Boards</u></B><br>
        <br>
        You are obliged to read the boards. This is our primary means of communication! 
        To do this, you must make an EZBoard account. For access to member protected 
        areas, post your name on the General Boards and state that you want in. 
        These boards are password protected and our officers will inform you of 
        the password on guild say.<br>
        <br>
        On the boards, use normal rules of conduct. Use them to debate, arrange 
        raids, chit chat or suggest improvement if there is something you don’t 
        like. Proper categories have been made for you to use them!&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Do not use the boards as a place for personal vendetta or flames. This 
        doesn’t mean that every sentence needs be polished and politically correct, 
        get to the point and say what you mean, but please be constructive in 
        all cases!<br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Grouping</u></B><br>
        <br>
        Grouping is the thing in Everquest. Always try and group with the guild 
        ! Always !&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        If you are moving into a new place, see if other guildies want to go with 
        you. For example post on the boards asking if anyone wants to camp any 
        area you wish to go to.<br>
        <br>
        Loot has been the reason for most disputes on Norrath. In Continental 
        Drift we do not want to be known as ninjalooters, lootwhores or similar. 
        Be fair and have a general rule that those that CAN and WILL use, will 
        roll on an item.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">However 
        be responsive to the group you are with, there is a thriving economy in 
        Everquest and many items can fetch a good price on auction. In many groups 
        all members are allowed to roll for any item.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        If you enter a group where the object is to gain wealth, be sure you agree 
        upon the rules before entering the group.&nbsp;This will prevent any disagreement 
        later on.<br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Raiding&nbsp;</u></B><br>
        <br>
        Anyone in Continental Drift can set up a raid involving a lot of people. 
        In fact we encourage people to do this. There are however some rules you 
        most apply to.<br>
        <br>
        * Be sure that everyone joining knows the objective for the raid. This 
        might sound formal, but it need not be. Having fun is a good enough reason 
        for going!<br>
        <br>
        * Never let down a guild member. This can be about joining the raid, help 
        with corpse retrieval or similar promises. You do not leave the raid or 
        let down a guild member for anything. That being said RL is more powerful 
        than Lord Nagafen and will always win, but please make sure everyone is 
        aware that you are leaving.<br>
        <br>
        * You are now the warlord! This takes planning. Planning is best done 
        on the boards. If you are looking to recruit many people for your raid 
        you have best give at least a weeks notice. The officers will always help 
        you plan and organise events, just ask us.<br>
        <br>
        * There are many things to learn about multigroup raids which you will 
        learn as a CD member. The most important one is 'THE WARLORD IS GOD!' 
        all members on the raid must follow his instructions to the letter.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Raid Loot Rules</u></B><br>
        <br>
        When raiding, loot rules are simple: We are not loot whores.<br>
        <br>
        * Check the drops and announce them.<br>
        <br>
        * Everyone who CAN and WILL use an item will roll.<br>
        <br>
        * Rotation means, that once you have won a roll on a type of equipment 
        you loose your right to roll on that type until all who CAN and WILL use 
        that type of equipment have won such an item. There are four types of 
        equipment: normal armor, breastplate, robe and weapons. For example you 
        win a piece of armor and next a weapon drops. In this case you are allowed 
        to roll on the weapon drop again with a chance to win it.<br>
        <br>
        * Honour cannot be explained, it is just a common trait for Continental 
        Drift members. There are no rules for this it simply has to be lived, 
        honour makes people pass on rolls for one or the other personal reasons.<br>
        </span></font></p>

        main objective of the guild is to have fun, these rules are here to try

        Above all else we are here to help one another in the land of Norrath.</span></font></p>

        from that there is no other difference between you and the other members. 
        you are welcome to attend all raids and will be included in all loot rolls
