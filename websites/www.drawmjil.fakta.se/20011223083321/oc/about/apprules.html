<hr width="60%">
<TABLE border=0 width=60% align="center"><TR><TD>
<ul>
<li>
Your Character must reside on the Xev server. 
</li><li>
To become a member of Old Continent you must post an application on this board yourself, stating the reasons why you would like to join.
</li><li>
Eight Old Continent members must then approve your application. This they can do by giving you their vote. (they must state so clearly).
</li><li>
After you are invited to Old Continent you become an initiate. An initiate is no different from a member except that an initiate is not allowed to vote for or veto applications.
</li><li>
An initiate can post a request for promotion on this board (or a private board) after he or she feels at home in Old Continent. Only officers decide about the promotion and one of the more important factors considered is raid attendance but also things like general involvement in the guild etc.
</li><li>
Any member can veto an application. They must however supply a good reason for doing so. (a veto can be given on a private board).
</li><li>
Since almost all guild events and activities are aimed at lvl 45+, we strongly advice you not to apply below this level. Take a look at our sister guild Continental Drift instead.
</li><li>
Applying to another guild either when you are an Old Continent member or during the time that you have an active application for Old Continent will void your membership or application to Old Continent. We only want dedicated and loyal players in our family.
</li><li>
Because we only want dedicated and loyal players in our family, it is not allowed to have alts in Old Continent while your main character resides in another guild or has an active application for another guild.
