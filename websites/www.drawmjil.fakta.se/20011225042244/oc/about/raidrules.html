<li>
During a raid the Warlords word is law. His/her decisions are not open for discussion or other comments. If you have a problem with a decision you write it down and it can be discussed after the raid.
</li><li>
All the Warlords orders are to be followed promptly and precisely.
</li><li>
Be there when the raid starts. Do not login at the Sebilis bubble only half an hour in advance and expect to be on time for a raid in Permafrost for example. It is better to be 30 minutes early than 15 minutes late.
</li><li>
A raid might require extensive use of guildchat. In that case all members not on the raid are requested to keep their use of guildchat to an absolute minimum.
</li><li>
During a raid the shout channel is reserved for the Warlord(s), Puller(s) and Scout(s).
</li><li>
Limit your use of the other public channels, use groupchat and tells as much as possible. 
</li><li>
But do not send tells to the Warlord(s), Puller(s) and Scout(s) unless absolutely necessary.
</li><li>
Do not request for a certain mob to be pulled.
</li><li>
Try to announce at least 45 minutes in advance when you have to leave a raid early.
</li><li>
No raid is over untill all Corpse Recovery is done.
</li><li>
When a raid is over, do not run for the nearest exit. We all leave together in an organised way.
