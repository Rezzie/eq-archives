        <font size="2"><b><font color="#000080">A Brief overview of
        how to play a Bard on the Plane of Hate<br>
        </font></b><br>
        <br>
        1.)If you go at 46 and lose that level you CAN be res'ed back to your
        corpse. If your res. time elapses you DO have a rather large problem..<br>
        <br>
        2.)Be ready to die! You will die and quite likely several times..If you
        get a real bad pull it is fully expected that you will aggro mobs onto
        you and die-giving the Clerics time to camp out..Camping out ahead of
        your clerics to save your own tail is a bad bad thing.<br>
        <br>
        3.) If you are in the group where the puller is -turn your songs off
        while he is pulling. Playing a song on the puller could complicate his
        aggro radius and cause him to aggro many mobs.<br>
        <br>
        4.) Turn off your songs as the mob is being pulled into camp. Let the
        mob build a little bit of HATE. This has been fixed quite a bit when
        verant reduced the hate factor of our songs but its still an issue.
        Sometimes if your playing a party buffing song on the pull the mob will
        come straight to you..<br>
        <br>
        5.) Although i am VERY far from a mana bard -the mana song is likely
        your best tune on the planes. Mobs drop to fast and with many folks
        hitting them ..Your best best is to be a 24/7 mana bard in a team with
        your shaman (buff machine) and cleric and chanter if possible. The
        chanter and shaman will be buffing non stop and will always be lookin
        for mana-its good to have the bard with them<br>
        <br>
        6.) NEVER DOT! Unless you are 100% certain that the mob you are fighting
        is the only one! Sometimes mobs wander in or come on a delayed pull.
        Dotting a Banshess when a Spite Golem wanders in will upset your
        chanters (spites are un mezzable).<br>
        <br>
        7.) When you die-you WILL DIE! Dont go afk on the CR. Bards are one of
        the first folks res'ed up. Your song is needed for clerics and all the
        res'ing they have to do. Upon your res. drop your present group and form
        up with as many clerics as you can.<br>
        <br>
        8.) On Maestro memm all your resist songs, equip your drum, grab as many
        tanks as you can in your group and go stand as close to Maestro as
        possible. Your job is to keep your tanks alive-the key to Maestro is
        isolating him behind a wall of tanks and keeping his AE off the tanks
        and OFF THE CASTERS. Get that MR up over 200 and your group will be in
        AWE of you-theyll resist all the lifetaps and gravity flux-youll be the
        HERO and Maestro will die.<br>
        <br>
        9.) On Maestro you too will likely die-Maestro will more then likely
        have an item for you-make arrangements to get an immediate Res. Sucks
        having evensong or six note blade rot cause you were the last guy to
        get-res'ed or your corpse is in the wall and everyone forgot that you
        were dead.<br>
        <br>
        10.) Never loot an item that you arent 100000% certain is a bard item
        that you are allowed (won in random or have seniority) to have. Damn
        near everything is no drop-looting a clerics BP because you were
        inspecting the stats and lagged -will make the whole world mad at you.
        Sit back-let the selected looters loot. Ask in ooc. for the stats if you
        are curious.<br>
        <br>
        11.) All Gems should be randomed - they are VERY valuable-If you happen
        to loot a gem-make sure to notify the folks that you are with. Call out
        all words, components.. MY advice is to assign a specific looter per
        group.<br>
        <br>
        12.) Dont ask the puller &quot;when are you pulling the
        banshee's&quot;.. Makes you look rather greedy.<br>
        <br>
        13.) Bring a TON of food and water and several 100 plat. You should
        offer to pay the wizzie for the component he needed to gate you up. You
        should offer to contribute to your clerics component fund for all those
        snappy buffs he has given you. Many groups/guilds/alliances/-have funds
        that are used for all this-generated by the saleable gems looted on the
        planes-if your a guest or not part of a system like that-be prepared to
        pay or at least offer to pay our own way.<br>
        <br>
        14.) When waiting for your Res' be SURE to duel a warrior or other
        tank-mem bellow for this and chains. Run around and humiliate him as
        best you can. Do not attempt this with that naked monk that just offered
        you a duel.<br>
        <br>
        15.) Get bound at the wizzie spires in Gfay.<br>
        <br>
        16.) DO go with your good equip-you will not lose your corpse.!! Weanies
        that show up on HATE in bronze really look foolish and will not be taken
        seriously. Corpse loss on mature servers is UBER UBER UBER rare. Dont
        worry about it.<br>
        <br>
        17.) If you loot a breastplate on your first trip-be sure visit all bard
        boards and fluant it, brag, dance around, post screen shots, and
        otherwise drive bards like me totally crazy. We love to be reminded of
        how totally unlucky we are from our 100's of hours spent squandered in
        that god forsaken place ..<br>
        <br>
        P.S. Now that Kunark is out the 2 most valualbe items are the Lute that
        Maestro drops and the Breastplate. Not sure if other bards will be
        going-dont make &quot;deals&quot; that involve you NOT getting these
        items if they drop. The weapons are all 11/25 (including Dawnchaser from
        Innourruk) ..Many weapons and now armor are much much better in Kunark..
        LUTE AND BP! those are the prizes.</font><br>
