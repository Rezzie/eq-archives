        <font size="2">This is to help you necros in the
        guild get a pretty cool dag.. In case you haven't allready got it!<br>
        Oh.. and then there is a lot of monk armor dropping here, the bamboo bo
        staff.. 8/21 and another 14/30 or somthing, (Verant lowerd the weights
        on these in the last patch), the robe of dalnir and of course the&nbsp; neclace
        of superiority<br>
        <br>
        It's called a Visceral Dagger and stats are 6/21 +8 int<br>
        (Oh, and it's rumored not to be the finished item.. Discussions are
        gooing on about it, but as far as I know it's only led to players giving
        the dags they'd camped for 20h+ to NPC:s who said &quot;thank
        you!&quot;)<br>
        <br>
        Now.. Start by reading this:<br>
        <a href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir.htm">Spoiler</a><br>
        <br>
        For the dag you need to combine the 4 parts in the &quot;always works
        forge&quot;. Each part drops on a Kly Impercator. The latter are rare
        spawns, one in each part of the dunegon except the first.<br>
        <br>
        Oh yes.. The dunegon is split up so when one passes a certain point (A
        drop or a secret wall) one cannot go back and have to either gate or
        find an exit zone. And you cannot bind within the dunegon, so start by
        binding before you zone in.<br>
        <br>
        You zone in, invis up, get Dmf up and find the first drop in the
        citadell. On the second level you look up the room marked with an 8 on
        the map. The first Impercator spawns in the nich in this room.. This is
        also the guy that drops the robe of dalnir but that is a rare drop. He
        himself is a rare spawn (as are all the Imps) so be prepared to kill a
        few placeholders. He always drops the hilt for the dag (It is
        Magic,Nodrop).<br>
        <br>
        Second you find the checkered secret pit to level 3. When you get down
        here you can go to a room with 3 headless statues (10 on the map). this
        is where the undead smith spawns.. He always drops the hammer needed for
        the quest (this is Magic, Nodrop, NoRent), however.. it is noRent so you
        should prolly do him last. He spawns agaist the far wall opposite the
        entry though.. (Oh and did I say he's a rare spawn ;-)<br>
        <br>
        Anyway.. Ignore the smith for now and proceed to the chapel. this
        Impercator spawns behind the altar in the middle. He is hard to target
        since the Kly attending the mass has their tails all over the place.<br>
        Now.. Just beyond the room from the chapel is a small round room. This
        is a safe spot, no wanderer comes here. Med and get a pet parked here.
        As for pulling.. I usually just cleared out the church to get to the ph,
        singlepulling from the ones infront with darkness. I was L50 and thus
        able to singlepull.. You prolly can't do this quest solo until L49 (at
        least I wouldn't). Most of the Kly are casters and often when you pull
        they just start blasting you. As soon as you pull.. rush back to your
        pet and be prepared to back of pet. If you fail this and the pet engages
        all the kly, just fegin and /quit. When the kly gets beyond the bend you
        can engage pet and fear if you like. The fear path goes back the way you
        came and not back into the church, and they will run anyway when low so
        it pays to have cleared the two wandering mobs in the corridor and to
        keep them 'in the dark'. When you finally get the kly he drops the sharp
        shard. Looks like a giant snake fang (it is Magic)<br>
        <br>
        Now for the third pice.. The jagged shard. In the room marked 11 there
        is a secret. This is one way only..<br>
        In the room marked 15 is a skeleton who drops the bo staffs. Now look at
        the map where it says 17. Right above is a room containing a chemical
        lab with two spawns. One of these is the 3:rd Impercator. It is a good
        thing to start out by the water, get a pet up and clear the way to that
        room, and then camp in that room and pull from outside. Dining room just
        a bit futher in isn't nessecary to do, but can be done if it gets
        booring. The fear path of the cly goes back the way you came, and they
        almost always get stuck in the doorways. I camped this Kly for 12h and
        killed a million Kly's during that time. I also got two 'Sarnak earrings
        of station' from Kly invoker/evokers. These babys are Ac5 +5 str nodrop
        earrings. If someone has a twink melee it might be a good idea to get
        him down and camp him by the water where there are no mobs, to loot the
        possible earring!<br>
        <br>
        Got the Jagged shard?! Good.. Just do the really long and booring camp
        for the smith (You have to gate out to get there) and then you can go to
        room 18 and combine the parts into the dagger in the always works
        smithy.<br>
        (Oh and don't give up.. I camped for this for 30+h totally without xp
        with the exception of Overseer, and a few deaths learning how it was
        pathed the hard way)<br>
        <br>
        Neclace of superiority<br>
        Comes of 'The Kly'.. He spawns in room 19. His placeholder is the Kly
        Overseer. This guy can be quite nasty. He's known to wipe out full L50+
        groups, however a necro can solo him whithout too much trouble. He's got
        a ton of hp, but the problem is a 500+ (maby even 800dmg) proc he uses.
        I've heard that he casts Ice comet, this is not true.. It is a proc
        effect.. the problem is that it can (and will) proc 4 times in one melee
        round. My tactic: Stand in the first room after the water, after having
        cleared all the interveaning Kly. Do /pet attack, and start casting
        darkness (I used dooming.. It has to be timed with casting time.. If you
        use clinging you'll have to be closer). The darkness should take hold
        right as the pet engages. Now Overseer will trash the pet.. However the
        pet can take 4 procs and can stand one round at least. Immediatly cast
        fear.. The Overseers fearpath goes back towards you, and darked he will
        always get stuck in the first doorway.. Then just keep him feared and
        load him with ignite, VoS, whatever.. If he resists the first darkness
        (Or the fear.. He's supposed to be just L37 so he shouldn't)..
        Immediatly fegin!<br>
        <br>
        I've never seen 'The Kly' but he's supposed to just be a tougher
        Overseer..<br>
        <br>
        Oh and do keep track of spawntimes.. the whole dunegon is on a 13 min
        spawnshedule!</font>
