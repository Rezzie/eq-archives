        <p><font face="Arial" size="1">My name is Jadee. I am a wood elf who
        loves animals and climbing trees. Sometimes I will climb the highest
        thing I can find, and that is usually the wizzy spires. I am also
        usually seen with an animal trailing behind me. I have taken the
        profession of being a druid, so if you need a port on the MAINLANDS (no
        expansion packs) feel free to send me a tell.<br>
        <br>
        I love making people smile, and I think I'm a pretty good listener, so
        if you need someone to talk to, I'm here. If you need someone to give a
        hug, those come in abundance from me. My goal in this guild is to meet
        everyone and know at least one thing about them. It may take awhile, but
        I think it's worth it!<br>
        <br>
        Let's get together sometime and have a small party. I am a master baker
        and potter, with the hints of being a brewer, tailor, and blacksmith.<br>
        <br>
        I do have a website: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START-->
        <a href="http://beam.to/JD">beam.to/JD</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->
        but it has not been updated since I've moved from Povar. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->
        <!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->
        Need to work on that hehe.<br>
        <br>
        Oh yes, and I am married in EverQuest to Jogeir, who has gone MIA. If
        anyone has seen a handsome bard running around with his name, please let
        me know. </font><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) -->
