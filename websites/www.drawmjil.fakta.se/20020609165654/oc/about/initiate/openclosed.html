There are two types of raids in OC:
<OL>
<LI>Open raids, (i.e. friends outside the guild can be invited and all loot is equally rolled on by those who can and will use)
</LI>
<LI>Closed raids, raids with OC members ONLY, if outsiders still want to join for the experience they will be CLEARLY INFORMED IN ADVANCE that they are joining a closed raid, meaning: First OC members get to roll on loot, but if no one needs (i.e. an item will rot).. the outsiders can roll amongst themselves.
</LI>
</OL>
The person that decides if a certain raid is closed or open is the raidleader.. the raid leader is responsible for accepting any invites and making it clear to them whether it is an open or closed raid and what that means.
