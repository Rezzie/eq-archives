</div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">As an applicant to &lt;Old Continent&gt; you are 
expected to familiarize yourself with all our guild rules.<br>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br>
&nbsp;</font><![endif]></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">To become a member follow the steps below:</font></p>
<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Your Character must reside on the Xev 
  server and be level 45+.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">To become a member of Old Continent you 
  must post an application on our application board yourself, stating the 
  reasons why you would like to join.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">When you apply, you MUST NOT be a member 
  of another guild. Clear up your background truthfully.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Eight full members must approve your 
  application. This they can do so, by stating clearly that they give you their 
  vote.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Applying to another guild either when you 
  are an Old Continent member or during the time that you have an active 
  application for Old Continent will void your membership or application to Old 
  Continent. We only want dedicated and loyal players.</font></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">After you have posted your application on 
the application board do not expect to get many votes right away unless you have 
really good friends in the guild who are full members. Gathering votes is a 
lengthy process at best where the initiative completely lies with the applicant. 
So you are going to have to put some work in if you really want to join our 
guild.<br>
<br>
The worst way you can go about it, is to ask people to vote for you. The best 
way you can go about this, is to seek
<a href="http://www.drawmjil.fakta.se/members.asp" style="color: #003399; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none">
us</a> out so you can group and raid with us. As far as we are concerned actions 
speak much louder than words. If you want to join a raid, you can read the
<a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/foldcontinentraids" style="color: #003399; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none">
raid board</a> and see if we have any plans. Please leave a message there if 
want to join a certain raid. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Two things you should know about &lt;Old 
Continent&gt; before joining a raid, those are the <a href="#_Toc531073044">general raid rules</a> and the
<a href="#_Toc531073045">raid loot rules</a>. Another thing you must be aware of is our stance on
<a href="#_Toc531073043">account sharing </a> <br>
<br>
Please keep in mind that &lt;Old Continent&gt; is primarily a European guild. Most of 
our raids are planned around 19.00-20.00 CET on weekdays and 14.00 CET in 
weekends. If that does not fit your playing hours we are probably not the right 
guild for you. <br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">If some parts of this guide are not clear to 
you or you disagree with some parts, please feel free to contact an officer 
in-game, we are nearly always available to discuss matters with you.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073024"><font size="2">§1.1 All characters must be in the 
guild</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Because we only want dedicated and loyal 
players in our family, it is not allowed to have alts in Old Continent while 
your main character resides in another guild nor has an active application for 
another guild.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073025"><font size="2">§1.2 Level limit</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Characters in &lt;Old Continent&gt; must be level 
46 or above. An exception to that rule is alt characters or the guild bank 
characters.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073026"><font size="2">§1.3 Automatic voidance of 
application or membership</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Applying to another guild either when you 
are an Old Continent member or during the time that you have an active 
application for Old Continent will void your membership or application to Old 
Continent. We only want dedicated and loyal players.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073027"><font size="2">§1.4 Joining from &lt;Continental Drift&gt;</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">There are two ways players from &lt;Continental 
Drift&gt; can join &lt;Old Continent&gt;.<br>
1) By recommendation of three officers from &lt;Continental Drift&gt;.<br>
2) By following the regular application procedure for all applicants.<br>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br>
&nbsp;</font><![endif]></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The first method is preferred; if this fails 
however the CD member can opt for the 2nd method. </font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073028"><font size="2">§1.5 Veto to an application</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Any full member can veto an application. 
They must however supply a reason for doing so - a veto should be given on the 
private members board. An officer will then inform the applicant that the 
application has been voided.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073029"><font size="2">§1.6 Initiate Member</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">After you are invited to Old Continent you 
become an Initiate Member. An initiate is with minor exceptions not different 
from a member except, that an Initiate member is not allowed to vote for or veto 
applications. </font></p>
<div style="border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;mso-border-bottom-alt:
solid windowtext .5pt;padding:0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm">
  <h1><a name="_Toc531073030"><font size="3">§2 Initiate Member</font></a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><br>
An initiate is in almost all aspects equal to a full member of Old Continent. An 
Initiate does not get to vote for or veto applicants. An initiate will be 
removed from the guild more rapidly than a full member in case of inappropriate 
behavior. Also an initiate can not expect any guild help on his/her epic. It is 
only natural that you help the guild first for a while before the guild helps 
you.<br>

<h3><a name="_Toc531073032"><font size="2">§2.2 The Boards</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">You are obliged to read the boards. This is 
our primary means of communication! To do this, you must make an EZBoard 
account. For access to member protected areas, post your name on the General 
Boards and state that you want in. These boards are not password protected and 
our EZBoard administrators will let you in. <br>
<br>
Use normal rules of conduct. Use the debate to arrange raids, chit chat or 
suggest improvement if there is something you dont like. Proper categories have 
been made for you to use them! <br>
<br>
When posting use a conscience subject, bad examples are &quot;Read this&quot;, &quot;Very 
important&quot;, etc. Do not use the boards as a place for personal vendetta or 
flames. This doesnt mean that every sentence need be polished and politically 
correct: get to the point and say what you mean, but please be constructive !</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073033"><font size="2">§2.3 The Raid Board</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/foldcontinentraids" style="color: #003399; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none">
<font size="2">The raid board</font></a><font size="2"> is where we announce our 
raids. <br>
<br>
Anyone in Old Continent can organize a raid. This does not mean you have to 
warlord the raid you are organizing. You can ask someone else to be the warlord. 
However before you announce the raid you have to have a warlord. And that is 
just one of the many things you need. You also need a bare minimum of required 
classes. <br>
<br>
For example you want to make a Plane of Hate raid you will need enchanters, 
clerics and wizards and maybe a monk puller at the very least. The recruiting 
can be done in the member chat forum but it is much better to send tells in-game 
to the people you think you need. If you have never organized a raid before it 
might also be a smart idea to talk it through with an officer first. <br>
<br>
After you have gathered enough support for the raid you are ready to make a post 
on the raid board. You should do this preferably a week in advance but at the 
very least four days in advance. <br>
<br>
The topic must contain: Place - date - time<br>
The body must contain: Gathering place, warlord(s), goal of the raid and 
optionally raid specific loot rules, whether the raid is
<a href="http://www.drawmjil.fakta.se/oc/about/initiate/openclosed.html" style="color: #003399; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none">
open or closed</a> and links to maps and tactics. <br>
<br>
If you want to raid some place but do want to organize it you can always discuss 
it with an officer and we will see what we can do for you.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073034"><font size="2">§2.4 Open raids and closed raids</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">There are two types of raids: </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin-left: 36.0pt">
<font size="2">1.</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font size="2">Open raids means friends outside the guild can be 
invited and all loot is equally rolled on by those who can and will use. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin-left: 36.0pt">
<font size="2">2.</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font size="2">Closed raids, raids with OC members ONLY. If 
outsiders still want to join for the experience they will be CLEARLY INFORMED IN 
ADVANCE that they are joining a closed raid. First OC members get to roll on 
loot, but if no one needs (i.e. an item will rot) the outsiders can roll amongst 
themselves. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The person that decides if a certain raid is 
closed or open is the raid leader. The raid leader is responsible for accepting 
any invites and making it clear to them whether it is an open or closed raid and 
what that means.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073035"><font size="2">§2.5 Guild Loot</font></a><font size="2">
<br>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br>
&nbsp;</font><![endif]></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Guild loot is items which you received from 
being in a guild group, on a guild raid, received from a guild member or from 
the guild bank. We always use &quot;need before greed&quot; loot rules. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Guild items have to stay within the guild. 
If you dont use the item anymore you are expected to hand it down to a guildie. 
Selling an item that the guild got for you is considered a major offence against 
the spirit of the guild. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u><font size="2">Note 1:</font></u><font size="2"> We do 
not keep exact track of guild items and we never will. It is a players own 
responsibility to play within the spirit of the guild and if they cannot or will 
not, then it is best they rethink their membership. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u><font size="2">Note 2:</font></u><font size="2"> The 
guild bank is a private member forum on our boards so you at anytime can see

<h3><a name="_Toc531073036"><font size="2">§2.6 Private Loot</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><br>
This encompasses equipment which you have received during your travels of 
Norrath and during hunts for experience, quests you did or maybe by attending 
raids of other guilds. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">This is your property and you can do with it 
whatever you please. There will never be any rules in this guild forcing you one 
way or another concerning your property. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">You are welcome to donate equipment to the 
guild bank. You can sell equipment to members, but all in good spirit a discount 
is welcome.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073037"><font size="2">§2.7 Spells</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><br>
Spells are instrumental to high level casters; everyone is requested to make all 
spells especially level 55+ ones available to the guild.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073038"><font size="2">§2.8 Guild chat channel</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Guild chat is the lifeblood of our guild. It 
is our common line of communication when we are online. How you use guild chat 
is of the utmost importance. EverQuest is a &quot;team sport&quot; you will never get far 
and do exciting things alone. <br>
<br>
Do not pull too much attention to yourself and your wishes in guild chat. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">If you want something to happen you better 
start working towards it by sending tells to the people you think can help you.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Repeating your wishes in guild chat will not 
amount to anything except that you will annoy people.<br>
<br>
Other things you should know about guild chat: </font></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><u><font size="2">SOCIAL</font></u><font size="2">: Chat 
  and joke, any normal socializing. Guild chat is not for whining, swearing, 
  complaining or personal attacks. </font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><u><font size="2">HELP:</font></u><font size="2"> 
  Request help for ports, price checks or resurrections for that matter. We are 
  here to help each other. However do NOT see this as a service which you at any 
  time can request and expect delivered. So do not keep repeating your request. 
  After two times everyone online probably heard it. Try to solve your problem 
  then by sending tells instead. </font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><u><font size="2">RAIDS:</font></u><font size="2"> The 
  guild chat may be &quot;borrowed&quot; by a majority of people on a raid where fast 
  communication is needed. If so, please try and keep socializing and jokes low.
  </font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><u><font size="2">SILENCE:</font></u><font size="2"> The 
  guild leader or any officer can call &quot;GUILD SILENCE&quot;. This basically means 
  that information necessary for us all to hear are being relayed and just for a 
  short period we need not to be interrupted. </font></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073039"><font size="2">§2.9 Grouping</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Always try and group with the guild! Always! 
If no group is available, try to make one. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><br>
If you are moving into a new place, check with guildies that some move with you.<br>
<br>
When in a group, always try and foresee when people are leaving and ask in guild 
chat, that in 15 min. you have an opening for a healer, tank or caster and e.g. 
Sebilis Disco.<br>
<br>
Loot may have been the reason for most disputes on Norath. In Old Continent we 
do not want to be known as ninja looters, loot whores or similar. Be fair and 
have a general rule that those that CAN and WILL use will roll on an item. <br>
<br>
If you enter a group where the object is to gain wealth, be sure you agree upon 
the rules before entering the group or having new members on board. Meaning if 
you enter a group at Disco in lower guk and you want to roll on the Froglok 
Bonecaster Robe, even though you are a warrior: say so before! <br>
<br>
In OC, a guild camp might have had the purpose to get Catapult out of his newbie 
robe, please notice the difference.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073040"><font size="2">§2.10 Going from Initiate Member to 
Member</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">An Initiate member can post a request for 
promotion on our private board after he or she feels at home in Old Continent. 
Only officers decide about the promotion and one of the more important factors 
considered is raid attendance, but also things like general involvement in the 
guild.</font> </p>

  <h1><a name="_Toc531073041"><font size="3">§3 Member</font></a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">A member is expected to have read and 
understood all of the parts of the chapters Application for Membership and 
Initiate Member since several of these rules of course applies to full members 
as well.<br>
<br>
A member has the power to vote and veto applicants as described in §1 and §1.5. 
One veto is enough to keep an applicant from becoming an initiate. However a 
veto without a very good reason will not be accepted. The right to veto should 
never be used lightly and is really only there to keep confirmed badmouthing, 
ninja looting and kill stealers out of our guild. <br>
<br>
Just as the right to veto the right to vote should never be used lightly either. 
Voting for someone means at least three things: </font></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">You consider this person a friend. </font>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">You are convinced that this person has 
  made a big effort to join our guild.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">You think this person will be an asset to 
  the guild. </font></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">If the guild runs into trouble with the 
person(s) you have voted for this will reflect back on you. In practice this 
could mean for example that when an initiate you have voted for does not play 
within the spirit of the guild, you will be asked to have a talk with that 
person. <br>
<br>
If some parts of this guide are not clear to you or you disagree with some 
parts, please feel free to contact an officer in-game, we are nearly always 
available to discuss matters with you.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073042"><font size="2">§3.1 Epics and high end Quests</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Crucial parts in epics or other high end 
quests require that you obtain help from the guild. Use the following guidelines 
when doing so:</font></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Research your epic or the quest! </font>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">See to it that you are 55+ at least. 
  Apart from the fact that it would annoy everyone immensely to see level 50 
  players running around with epic stuff, they wouldn't be able to do much 
  themselves. </font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Be prepared that you'll have to do a lot 
  of work over a prolonged period of time. Some people starting their epics 
  around L50 will most likely have gotten to L60 before completing them. </font>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Split the epic into smaller segments. 
  Decide where you will need the help of the guild. I.e., you can't do it with 
  just a small group of friends. </font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Start with one segment and plan a raid 
  around it. Decide what classes you need and how much people should be the 
  absolute minimum. Read the boards and talk to people having done the quests to 
  gather information. </font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Set a date make a post on the board about 
  what is about to be attempted and get people to dedicate themselves to help 
  out. </font></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u><font size="2">Now, a few hints: </font></u>
<font size="2"><br>
Don't split your epic into 3 parts and try and have the guild doing these three 
parts three days in a row! Plan one raid, execute it and learn from it before 
going on to planning the next one. Most members will be joining because they 
want to have a good time, not because they have a driving ambition to see you 
flaunt your epic-gun. It is your responsibility to see to it that the 
participants have a good time and an exciting raid. <br>
<br>
Don't expect that one word in guild chat, asking for participants and expect 
people to enlist, or even come if enlisted. It won't work that way! Make a post 
on the raid board where you describe in detail what is about to be attempted and 
what place and time is set - the latter preferably in several time zones. That 
is not enough by a long shot. Then you should make personal tells in game where 
you get people to book that day, and promise to come, to ensure that you'll have 
enough to do what you intend. If you can't raise enough people you will have to 
set another time. <br>
<br>
You should have spoken at length with people having key-roles in the fight/raid. 
Do the thinking for the instrumental classes beforehand and go through their 
role with them ahead - confusion is the source of all failures! <br>
<br>
Supply participants with as much information as possible. Not only in the post 
on the board, but at the start of the raid, and during. Several times if 
possible! Ambitious epic-questers might even want to supply Catapult with 
material for a guide regarding their quest. Having links to other message boards 
where the subject is discussed and sites dealing with it, on the informative 
post on the raid board is a good idea at any rate. <br>
<br>
As always, officers will try and be helpful and assist with the raids, however 
they need to be informed and asked just like everyone else. <br>
<br>
Do not make the mistake of pushing people to join your epic-campaign while 
totally ignoring others needing the same help!</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073043"><font size="2">§3.2 Account sharing</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Some people have access to others accounts 
and this is beneficial to the guild in many situations, but please be aware that 
WHOEVER uses your account, it will be treated in the same way as if it was you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;i.e. If someone else commits a breach of 
our guild rules while using your account it will be dealt with in the same way 
as if it was you playing - they are still wearing an Old Continent guildtag (or 
trying to get one) and as such must behave accordingly. At higher levels in 
EverQuest, reputation means a great deal.<br>
<br>
So please make sure that anyone who has access to your account knows guild rules 
and sticks to them. It would be very sad to guild remove or veto anyone due to 
this but it will be done if it is felt necessary.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Be there when the raid starts. Do not login 
at the Sebilis bubble only half an hour in advance and expect to be on time for 
a raid in Permafrost for example. It is better to be 30 minutes early than 15 
minutes late. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">A raid might require extensive use of guild

<h3><a name="_Toc531073045"><font size="2">§4.1 Raid loot rules  Conduct!</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Loot is a very physical result of a raid! It 
is also the subject which has caused the most trouble! It has split up guilds 
and made lethal enemies. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES will we allow whining 
or flames to occur! </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">At any moment - have a relaxed attitude and 
be sure that OC is not the place where someone is trying to lure loot into a 
closed-circle group of people. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Have the courage to enjoy a friend winning a 
nice item and give him support and room to be happy about it! Nothing is more 
discouraging than receiving a tell after you won an item, that you thought that 
another person deserved it more.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073046"><font size="2">§4.2 Raid loot rules  During the 
raid</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">When something drops during the raid:</font></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Check the drops and announce them. Often 
  there is a person handling loot  be sure he is the FIRST to know what 
  dropped.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Everyone who CAN and WILL use an item 
  will roll within the rotation system. </font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The rotation system: Once you have won a 
  roll on a type of equipment you loose your right to roll on that type until 
  all who CAN and WILL use that type of equipment have won such an item. There 
  are three types of equipment: <i>normal armor</i>, <i>chest pieces</i>, and <i>
  weapons</i>. For example you win a piece of armor and next a weapon drops. In 
  this case you are allowed to roll on the weapon drop, with a chance to win it.
  </font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Honor - Honor is letting someone else 
  loot an item if it is a major upgrade for them while it would only be a minor 
  upgrade for you. Honor is allowing someone to complete a set of armor. Honor 
  is thinking twice before rolling against a guild-elder. If you are below level 
  55 please remember that the higher level players often make a raid possible or 
  at least much easier. The guild is best served if the best drops go to the 
  higher level players who need them. </font></li>

<h3><a name="_Toc531073047"><font size="2">§4.3 Raid loot rules  Mains before 
alts</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Mains will loot before alts, so alts will 
not get any loot on raids unless no mains can use the loot or if the Warlord 
specifically asked you to play your alt. The Warlord has to announce this on a 
public channel. You then have the choice to loot as your alt or as your main if 
possible to move the main along. Places like Plane of Air might complicate this.

a great help to the guild and the raid, but the main will loot before alt rule 
also goes for them as well.<br>

<h3><a name="_Toc531073048"><font size="2">§4.4 Raid loot rules  Special items</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Some equipment is crucial for the entire 
guild to be used by the right people.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Epic pieces, breastplates/robes, money 
items, gems and spells will go to &lt;Old Continent&gt; so people invited to our raids 
(friends, applicants and Continental Drift) do not get to roll on these five 
types of items (unless no one in Old Continent can use). They MUST be informed 
of this before the raid starts - if they are not informed - they do get to roll 
as an OC member.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u><font size="2">Note:</font></u><font size="2"> Dragon 
haste items, mini boss drops are not reserved by these rules.<br>
<br>
</font><u><font size="2">Epic Pieces dropping on raids</font></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">If epic pieces drop on a raid inexpertly - 
if the raid was not made specifically on the raid board to get that epic piece 
for that specific person, the piece will go to the person that is the highest 
level, has the highest raid attendance, is the longest with the guild and is the 
furthest with the epic quest. If it is not clear who this is or the initial 
choice is contested by multiple persons then all who can and will use that piece 
for his or her epic will roll. Meaning we do not &quot;register&quot; progress of epic 
pieces, but trust that you will relay truthfully how far you are.<br>
<br>
<u>Scars of Velius Armor - Clothe Drops</u><br>
<br>
Robe will be rolled for first by Necromancers. The effect of the necromancer 
robe is very useful for the guild (It can cast the spell 500 mana cost New 
Summon Corpse using 80p small stackable coffins). If no necromancer needs it, 
then the robe is subject to the old loot rules. However it is very strongly 
suggested that those people who already have a similar planar robe pass. All 
other clothe drops will be rolled for by those who can and will use within the 
rotation system.<br>
<br>
<u>Scars of Velius Armor - Leather Drops<br>
</u><br>
Leather Breastplate will go first to druids. It has the very nice spell effect 
of Regrowth of the Cove on it. Monks there are alternatives like Phase Spider 
Carapace or Ice Burrower Skin. The rest of the drops will be rolled for within 
the rotation system.<br>
<br>
<u>Scars of Velius Armor - Chain drops</u><br>
<br>
I think the guild should not have a preference here. All the classes: rogue, 
ranger and shaman would benefit about equally. However again if you have a Plane 
of Growth breastplate, please pass roll to those who do not have such a 
marvelous piece of equipment.<br>
<br>
<u>Scars of Velius Armor - Plate drops</u><br>
<br>
On ALL drops first ALL our level 60 warriors will roll. If they pass or do not 
need then all 58+ Warriors, 58+ Shadowknights and 58+ Paladins will roll. If 
they pass or do not need, then all who can and will use the item will roll 
within the rotation system. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Spread the wealth, so if you already have 
pretty good Plane of Growth equipment please pass on rolls for your guildmates 
who do not have such gear yet.<br>
<br>
<u>Note:</u> If you have Kunark legs or Kunark Breastplate you are expected to 
offer them for roll if you upgrade to Scars of Velius armor.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073049"><font size="2">§4.5 Raid loot rules  Warlord can 
call special rules before the raid</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">When organizing a raid, a Warlord can set 
different rules as long as they are announced to all participants beforehand. 
Use the discussion boards for this.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">A raid can be organized to get a certain 
item for a certain person. But it is also possible for the Warlord of a Plane of 
Hate raid to announce beforehand that the first Breastplate that drops goes to a 
certain tanker for example.</font></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc531073050"><font size="2">§4.6 Raid loot rules  Money items</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">All gems and money items that drop goes 
default to the guild bank. All spells that drop that no-one attending can use go 
default to the guild bank. This includes spells that are too high to use. So if 
a level 60 magician spell would drop and there is no level 60 magician present, 
the spell goes to the guild bank. Even if there is a level 59 Magician present. 
Any officers present on the raid can represent the guild bank. </font></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc531073052"><font size="2">§4.8 Raid loot rules  Passing on 
items</font></a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;<br>
If you win an item on a guild raid and it replaces the old item you had, you are 
expected to pass the old item down to a fellow guild-member  especially if the 
item you already use was won within the guild (and isnt no-drop). Spread the 
wealth!</font></p>
