        Hate</font></b><font color="black" face="Arial" size="2"><br>
        <br>
        Yes boys and girls, we have a defined and unique role in Plane of Hate!
        As you have noticed from the mob list, Hate has a mix of living and
        undead mobs - and us, rogues, are the only ones who can be invisible to
        both at the same time. Thus, our role in Hate is to scout.<br>
        <br>
        What to scout for.<br>
        <br>
        Stuck pets. Most mobs in Hate have pets. Those pets tend to get stuck
        while their master runs around. If you pull the master of a stuck pet,
        the pet will most likely find its way to you - but it will being every
        mob it encounters on its way along. Thus, your primary mission is to
        watch out for stuck pets.<br>
        <br>
        Mob presense/disposition. You are not the puller - monks are. However,
        it is vital for monks to know what exactly IS around that corner or
        behind that wall - accurate information about mobs that are up in a
        house and their placement makes pulling a great deal easier for them.<br>
        Pulls condition. When one monk has pulled a house out and the second
        monk is waiting for a single mob to clear so it can be pulled, it is
        your job to watch over the mobs going back, and inform the monk when the
        pull is clear. Again, with accurate and complete information pulls can
        go quickly and efficiently.<br>
        <br>
        Trains. Unless everything is going 100% alright, do not engage in
        fighting - there are enough people in camp to kill mobs without you.
        Always wander around camp, and if you see several mobs running quickly
        in camp direction, immediately issue a train call - a few seconds
        advance warning can save everyone's day.<br>
        <br>
        Mob locations. Southwest corner of map mostly contains Clerics of
        Innoruuk (houses A, B, C are full of them), as well as some Scorn
        Banshees, Spite Golems, and the occasionall Kiraikuei. Liches and
        Revultant Rats exist mostly as wanderers. Southeast corner of map
        (around portal area) seems to be mostly Ire Ghatsts. Forsaken Revenants
        and Abhorrents occupy northeast corner of map. Ashenbone Drakes live on
        the upper level of zone, by Innoruuk (not shown on the map, entered via
        a ramp in center of zone, marked by 9). Maestro of Rancor sits in the
        northwest corner of house D, by an organ. He DOES see invis - stay away
        from him while monks are pulling - but when not aggroed, he always faces
        the corner, so you can sneak around building as much as you like
        (provided there are no banshees/liches around).<br>
        <br>
        </font><b><font color="#000080" face="Arial" size="2">Other Tips</font></b><font color="black" face="Arial" size="2"><br>
        <br>
        Be very, very, very careful. When scouting houses, peek in for a split
        second, and if you see a banshee/lich, back off immediately - hopefully,
        it will not aggro.<br>
        If something does aggro on you, do not run back to camp. Stand and die.
        You will lose some exp, but you will prevent 30+ other people from
        losing exp from the resulting train.<br>
        Mobs do aggro through floors and walls - however, they only do that if
        you are fighting something behind said wall/floor - a passing by rogue
        will not cause aggression. In houses C and D, mobs on second floor will
        not aggro on first floor pulls - but in other, small houses, they will.
        Houses P and Q cause limited aggression from house D - 2-3 mobs will
        come, but not the whole place. As the person orchestrating the pulls,
        keep that in mind.</font></td>
