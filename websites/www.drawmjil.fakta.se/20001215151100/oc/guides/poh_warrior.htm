        Hate</b></font>
        <p>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">We're gonna start by assuming the word Tank
        means Warrior because quite frankly by now you've noticed the size of
        the difference between first and second best. Ok this is gonna come in
        two parts. Part one will be what your job is if you're not the Master
        Assistee, the second part will be for the MA.<br>
        <br>
        Ok so you got a ride up to hate and you're all ready for that Indocite
        BP you've been after for ages eh? Well plan on rolling with a mess of
        other tanks and probably losing. The best pregame advice I have is turn
        all the combat spam you can off before you even go up, listening is
        crucial.<br>
        <br>
        The first words out of your mouth when you get in zone should be
        &quot;/shout Who is MA?&quot; Make your hotkey as soon as you get an
        answer to /assist &lt;whoever&gt;. Nothing will get you less invitations
        to planes raids than continualy breaking mez.<br>
        <br>
        Rules for every tank cept the MA:<br>
        <br>
        1) ALWAYS USE YOUR ASSIST KEY!<br>
        2) ALWAYS USE YOUR ASSIST KEY!<br>
        3) Charge in and fight till you or the baddie is dead.<br>
        4) Never break a mes, leave that to the MA.<br>
        5) Don't be afraid to ask for the buffs you need, this is a team effort.<br>
        6) Don't worry about your healer or anyone else getting beat on, stay
        with the MA's target.<br>
        7) ALWAYS USE YOUR ASSIST KEY!<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Ok, now for you balzy guys who wanna do the MA job, make a hotkey just
        like the rest of tha tanks but put five /poke's in your hotkey, this
        lets everyone know without a doubt which target you have chosen. You'll
        most likely be the tagger also if you're MA so remember this above all
        else, eat death rather than take a train to camp. Make sure you have a
        full supply of arrows before going up and ask a mage for more if you run
        out, this is the only way to tag properly.<br>
        <br>
        Rules for the MA:<br>
        <br>
        1) Never tag before the puller says tag!<br>
        2) Rearange groups to where you are in the puller's group for
        communication's sake.<br>
        3) Let the puller know when each mob drops, this is a good place to use
        a hotkey.<br>
        4) Listen to what your puller says, he is the boss. Suggest changes in
        downtime but never fail to abide by his decision.<br>
        5) Kill spite golems first and clerics second, all others are after
        them.<br>
        6) Take hits before you get back to camp if necessary to get the right
        target, do not go back with the wrong one and switch.<br>
        7) If you find yourself in camp fighting on the wrong target stay on it
        if it's not a camp wipeout situation.<br>
        8) If it is a wipeout situation switch to what you need to but shout
        SWITCH TARGETS and tap your poke hotkey ten times or so quickly.<br>
        9) Do not be afraid to call people after a pull by name publicly for not
        assisting if it's repeated.<br>
        10) Shout that Trolls have the biggest schlongs at least once an hour,
        Innoruuk and the Maestro love to hear this as do your fellow raiders.<br>
        <br>
        What it all boils down to is this is the purest time for a tank, you
        charge in and fight to the death. There will be no running, there will
        be no evacs, you or the baddie will die, it's great.<br>
        <br>
        P.S. the group with the strongest melee usually gets the kill in raids,
        nifty eh?<br>
