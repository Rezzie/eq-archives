You are oblidged to read the boards. This is our primary means of communication! To do this, you must make an EZBoard account. For access to member protected areas, post your name on the General Boards and state that you want in. These boards are not password protected and our EZBoard administrators will let you in.
<BR><BR>
On the boards, use normal rules of conduct. Use the debate to arrange raids, chit chat or suggest improvement if there is something you don’t like. Proper categories have been made for you to use them!
<BR><BR>
When posting use a consciece subject, bad examples are "Read this", "Very important", etc. Do not use the boards as a place for personal vendetta or flames. This doesn’t mean that every sentence need be polished and politically correct: get to the point and say what you mean, but please be constructive at any level !
