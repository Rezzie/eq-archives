<b>Recruitment</b><br>
<br>
We accept members from lvl 47 upwards we are in the main a mid/high lvl guild.<br>
<br>
All potential members must follow the application process as shown under the Apply link.<br>
<br>
Once this has been done try to find members to group with so that they can get to know you.<br>
<br>
We operate a voting system which means that our existing members need to give you a yes vote before you are allowed to become a member.<br>
<br>
You will require 7 member votes and 2 votes from Officers.<br>
<br>
So by getting to know us you will get the votes faster. Once you have the required votes an officer will contact you to arrange an invite to the guild.<br>
<br>
We operate a 2 month trial period during which time you are not allowed to take items from the guildbank or vote for new members. Apart from that there is no other difference between you and the other members. You are welcome to attend all raids and will be considered for loot drops as per the loot charter, which can be found on the message board.<br>
<br>
Full details of the application process can be found on the Message board under 'New Member Applications'.<br>
<br>

<b>Rules of Conduct</b><br>
<br>
This section could just be a reference to the everquest site. In short <br>
<br>
* Don’t train people on purpose, <br>
* Don’t KS, <br>
* Don’t give yourself and Continental Drift a bad name with rude behaviour in trades OOC or Shouts.<br>
* Don’t bicker about camp sites, but state your right.<br>
* Don’t let your first action be to /petition and call a GM if any of the Rules of Conduct are broken by others causing harassment to you. Seek diplomacy, call in friends or guild officers, then as a last resort /petition. <br>
* Many, many problems can be solved by the /ignore command.<br>
<br>

<b>Guild Chat</b><br>
<br>
The guild chat is our common line of communication when online. Here is how we can use it:<br>
<br>
* SOCIAL: Chat and joke, any normal socialising.<br>
<br>
* HELP: Request help for ports, price checks. We are here to help each other. However do NOT see this as a service which you at any time can request and expect delivered.<br>
<br>
* IGNORE: You are of course allowed to turn off guild chat if you are in a place where you do not need disturbance. Expect people to do this on raids.<br>
<br>
* RAIDS: During a raid a dedicated channel will be used for that raid. the raid channel should not be used for social chat during the raid, continue to use guild say for social and keep only raid relevant information in Raid chat.<br>
<br>
* SILENCE: The guild leader or any officer can call "Guild say SILENCE". This basically means that information necessary for us all to hear are being relayed and just for a short period we need not to be interrupted. <br>
<br>
*MOTD: The guild MOTD is displayed each time you log onto a character that is a CD member. It will often contain important information that the whole guild needs to know so please read this.<br>
<br>

<b>The Boards</b><br>
<br>
You are obliged to read the boards. This is our primary means of communication! To do this, you must make an EZBoard account. For access to member protected areas, post your name on the General Boards and state that you want in. These boards are password protected and our officers will inform you of the password on guild say.<br>
<br>
On the boards, use normal rules of conduct. Use them to debate, arrange raids, chit chat or suggest improvement if there is something you don’t like. Proper categories have been made for you to use them! <br>
<br>
Do not use the boards as a place for personal vendetta or flames. This doesn’t mean that every sentence needs be polished and politically correct, get to the point and say what you mean, but please be constructive in all cases!<br>
<br>
<b>Grouping</b><br>
<br>
Grouping is the thing in Everquest. Always try and group with the guild ! Always ! <br>
<br>
If you are moving into a new place, see if other guildies want to go with you. For example post on the boards asking if anyone wants to camp any area you wish to go to.<br>
<br>
Loot has been the reason for most disputes on Norrath. In Continental Drift we do not want to be known as ninjalooters, lootwhores or similar. Be fair and have a general rule that those that CAN and WILL use, will roll on an item. <br>
<br>
However be responsive to the group you are with, there is a thriving economy in Everquest and many items can fetch a good price on auction. In many groups all members are allowed to roll for any item. <br>
<br>
If you enter a group where the object is to gain wealth, be sure you agree upon the rules before entering the group. This will prevent any disagreement later on.<br>
<br>
<b>Raiding</b><br>
<br>
Anyone in Continental Drift can set up a raid involving a lot of people. In fact we encourage people to do this. There are however some rules you must adhere to.<br>
<br>
* Be sure that everyone joining knows the objective for the raid. This might sound formal, but it need not be. Having fun is a good enough reason for going!<br>
<br>
* Never let down a guild member. This can be about joining the raid, help with corpse retrieval or similar promises. You do not leave the raid or let down a guild member for anything. That being said RL is more powerful than Lord Nagafen and will always win, but please make sure everyone is aware that you are leaving.<br>
<br>
* You are now the warlord! This takes planning. Planning is best done on the boards. If you are looking to recruit many people for your raid you have best give at least a weeks notice. The officers will always help you plan and organise events, just ask us.<br>
<br>
* Create a channel for raid instructions. Make sure you inform people of the channel name and password. Use the channel for raid instructions and commands.<br>
<br>
* There are many things to learn about multigroup raids which you will learn as a CD member. The most important one is '<font color="#ff0000">THE WARLORD IS GOD!</font>' all members on the raid must follow his instructions to the letter.<br>
<br>
* While we do not enforce anyone to join any raid, raids may be cancelled if not enough people show up. If there is a guild raid going on make your best efforts to attend if you can.<br>
<br>

<b>Raid Loot Rules</b><br>
<br>
When raiding, loot rules are simple: We are not loot whores.<br>
<br>
* An Officer or nominated looter will check the drops and announce them.<br>
<br>
* Anyone who CAN and WILL use an item will send a tell to the 'handler' for the raid stating that they are interested in the item.<br>
<br>
* The loot council will choose from the people who have requested the item who should receive it. the decision will be made in line with the 'Loot Charter'. details of this can be found on the message board<br>
<br>
* Honour cannot be explained, it is just a common trait for Continental Drift members. There are no rules for this it simply has to be lived, honour makes people pass on items if they know another guild member will get more benefit from the item than they will. <br>
<br>
<b>Final Words</b>
<br>
The main objective of the guild is to have fun, these rules are here to try to make that easier for all guild members and the people they group with.<br>
Above all else we are here to help one another in the land of Norrath. As a member of Continental Drift you are expected to help other CD members whenever you can. You will get as much out of the guild as you are prepared to put in. Remember we are a HIGHLY social guild and expect all our members to interact with each other.<br>
