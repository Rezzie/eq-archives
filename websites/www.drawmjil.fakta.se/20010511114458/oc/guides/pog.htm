        about Plane of Growth</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Plane of Growth is a great place: great
        loot and good fun, but it has its hazzards.<br>
        The initial break is cake compared to hate/fear.<br>
        PoG looks much like fear in the sense that the mobs are spread over a
        large area, and thus easy to single pull (or atleast the chance of a
        train is vague).</font></p>
        <ol>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Everyone zone in with Invis and sow.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Head the west wall or any other area
            without mobs.<br>
            </font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once there the Protectors of Growth will
        prolly be on the way to slay any persons KoS there. PoG's have zonewide
        agro and thus they intend to kill ANY person KoS there as long as they
        are alive no matter where they are in PoG.<br>
        PoG's usually come in pairs but u can be lucky and only 1 will come.
        PoG's vary in lvl from about 53 to 57 (is my estimate) and CANNOT be
        mezzed. Thus u'll need a tank to warrior mezz them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->
        - hence one person tanks the add while the rest of the people slay the
        other...preferably a person with a high ac and capable of using a
        defensive discipline.<br>
        <br>
        After PoG's are killed u can proceed pulling &quot;safely&quot; to ur
        camp spot for about 20-25 mins(can't remember time excactly) until PoG's
        spawn again and come running to ya.<br>
        <br>
        We've been using a warrior to pull which seems like the best to do. Why?</font></p>
        <ol>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monk's FD works differently in PoG,
            mobs will remember agro after the monks get up etc.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Pulls CAN be very long and the number
            of Hp's the puller has becomes crucial.<br>
            There might be arguements for using other classes for pulls, but
            we've been very successfull using a warrior as bait<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->
            <!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->
            .</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When pulling, be sure to spot adds
            quickly cuz else they will rampage right through the caster ranks.
            Mobs in PoG can be VERY hard to mezz or unmezzable.<br>
            <br>
            </font></li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After clearing the camp spot area for
        mobs, proceed to a new area with fresh meat. Preferably near a wall
        (where the chances of adds is smaller).<br>
        Rangers, druids and paladins can't..or rather shouldn't... kill in PoG.
        Druids and rangers are very usefull however, for scouting the area for
        mobs and telling the puller where he can find his prey. They can also be
        very efficient to pull corpses (invis offcourse). ALOT of spells drop up
        there so they won't come home with empty hands.<br>
        Its also very nice to have a PoG-friendly cleric up there for
        emergencies. Melee's should be bound in Kael just for safety so they can
        participate in the CR.<br>
        <br>
        The tough part of PoG is the constantly returning PoG's, if u get wiped
        out it's very hard to recover the corpses and fend off those PoG's at
        the same time. Best thing to do is to &quot;train&quot; the PoG's AWAY
        from the CR spot and let the people there recover untill they have the
        strength to kill the 2 PoG's.<br>
        There are several named mobs up there that vary much in lvl, be carefull
        pulling those cuz some of them summon &quot;friends&quot; to join in on
        the battle. Best thing is to get comfertable with the zone first and
        then try out the named mobs. Besides every mob has a chance of dropping
        stuff.<br>
        <br>
        This information is obtained from my own experiences up there (Been
        there 7 times now) and i'm still learning. There are prolly many ways to
        do this, but this is how we've done it so far.<br>
        Good luck friends! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->
        <br>
        <br>
        Btw. PoG armor looks cool on Ogre's <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) -->
        </font>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Fekko have this to say
        about PoG</b></font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. HARMONY<br>
        <br>
        yes.. in capital letters... harmony owns up there when breaking mobs.
        And yes, most of the roamers are very easy to pull single, but there are
        also gathering of mobs that need to be split up and harmony does not
        mean faction hit.<br>
        <br>
        2. training.<br>
        <br>
        if a bad situation arises and all die.. is bad. As midgaard said is good
        if a non-kos cleric can be present to help out and make cr fast. In a
        real bad situation the pogs pops during the cr and that means problems
        if not tanks there to take care of them and manaless healers.<br>
        <br>
        ergo.. druid or ranger snares (wich most probably wont take hold if you
        not high lvl) and then proceeds to train them around while cr is beeing
        done. Once all back, got more mana and stuff you either try to taunt
        pogs of the trainers or trainer plain and simply dies and gets a rez
        later on.<br>
        <br>
        3. pogs<br>
        <br>
        very true - cant be mezzed - but can, with problem, be charmed.<br>
        <br>
        4. treants<br>
        <br>
        theese are to watch out for, at least the big trees. if memory serves me
        right are 5 of them (might be 4, dont remember names). Good thing about
        them is they always drop bp:s. They are mean to fight tho and have some
        special abilities. all of them got guardians. For example rumbleroot (i
        think thats him) got all the sylvain protectors in zone to guard him.
        That means that the instant you hit him all theese mobs (usually aroun
        10-15 or so) rushes you. solution is to train the tree around a long
        time while the rest picks off the other mobs till only tree is left.<br>
        <br>
        Theese trees are hard to fight for sure, but it is doable.<br>
        <br>
        One thing i dont recognize from midgaards description is fd pulling tho.
        I have been pulling with azzaz up there and even on 53 fd works just
        fine. Usually it is easier to train mobs tho or just die in spot and
        start over.<br>
        <br>
        all in all is not a very hard zone to learn nor to fight in once you got
        the hang of the pogs and how the treants roam.</font><br>
