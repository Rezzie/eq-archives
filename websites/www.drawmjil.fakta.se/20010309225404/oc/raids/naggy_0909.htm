    <td valign="top"><b><font face="Arial" color="#000080" size="2">The
      strangest thing happened today...</font></b>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I was going into norrath to get me a shiny
      new level in the left room in Solb. When I logged on Annanas told that we
      where going to do and Efreeti raid. Great I though, GEBS for Drawmjil to
      trade for a wurmslayer. I went and got myself a glass of wine and some
      snacks, setteling down for a nice IMP-slaying evening. When I get back,
      the Efreetiraid had suddenly turned into a firegiant raid.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, ok, lets rock, and alot of player
      from Old Continent gathered in the corridor. Hapi was warlord and giving
      commands with great authority. He also managed to recruit an very nice and
      competent (and Pretty) Monk, Danodare, to help us. Well, with Danodare in
      the lead, we followed and killed all the baddies without a single dead.
      Skarlon and another named giant gave Funk and Falloz nice stuff to.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we where almost done, Danodare
      anounces that if we want, we can setup a Naggy raid, and she offered help
      from Grey Council too. Great, everyone was very excited, and people from
      GC started pouring in. KEYSER, who was to high, but still voulonteered to
      take the role as warlord did a good job trying to get everything put
      togheter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Buffing, groupforming and all that started,
      which in my opinion took a lillte bit to long. I had to rebuff 3
      times before the action started. I cannot say how this could have been
      done faster, maybe putting all the tanks in line and let them go by the
      clerics, shamen and so on, eventually landing on the 'ready-spot'. Well,
      after that it was bashing time. All tanks (and Rangers to ;-) Charged the
      beast, the pets went in too. When at two boubbles of health, run out to get
      heal, and then back in. The dungeon echoed with the usually pathetic 'You
      will not evade me Drawmjil....' wich in the end. happened to be true. I
      think I was one of the last standing, but suddenly, I woke up in Oggok again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What supprised me then, was that before I
      even had time to tell the group I died, Malimas said 'Consent me' 2 min
      later I was back in business. GREAT corpse recovery, I think all that got
      it appriciated the efficency, thanks to everyone helping out. That is how
      it is suppose to work ;-)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, what happened now was that Grey
      Council called in more tanks, and everything was setup again, charge and
      finally the beast was slewn.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I had a GREAT time, thanks Hapi, Danodare,
      Keyser and all the rest that was there, I think everyone appriciated it,
      except maybe Funk, who got Linkdead before everyone ported out ;-) (He is
      back in business now, dont worry, meaner than ever).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some thoughts:</font></p>
      <ol style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt">
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Try to speed up the buffing process,
          dont know how, but everyone try to think of something.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Dicipline is VERY important, listen to
          the warlord and the more experienced players.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fast corpse recovery if good, for
          morale, and of course, for tactical reasons.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When fighting dragons as a tank, RUN
          when you have two bubs or less and get a heal, if you can stay alive
          for another rush, you will do more dmg than dead in Oggok.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Bring TANKS, first attempt was 10 tanks,
          not enough, at least not the level of that tanks that was there, 15
          level 45+ less if they are higher levels....</font></li>
