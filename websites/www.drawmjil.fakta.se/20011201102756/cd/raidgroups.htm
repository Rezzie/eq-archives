        RAIDS ARE NOT FOR EXPERIENCE DO NOT EXPECT TO GET ANY<br>
        <br>
        Type 1<br>
        <br>
        Groups are<br>
        <br>
        Pet Casters - Necro, Mage<br>
        Wizards<br>
        Healers - Clerics only<br>
        Buffer shields and dmg - Shammies, druids<br>
        Tanks - Pally's, Warriors,<br>
        <br>
        ok now you may have noticed that I have left out quite a few classes that 
        is because these are main groups.<br>
        All the other classes fit into these as needed<br>
        <br>
        I.e.<br>
        Group one<br>
        warrior 1<br>
        warrior 2<br>
        Paladin<br>
        Monk<br>
        Ranger<br>
        Bard<br>
        <br>
        Group 2<br>
        Warrior<br>
        warrior 2<br>
        Monk<br>
        Monk 2<br>
        Ranger<br>
        Bard<br>
        <br>
        Group 3<br>
        Necro<br>
        necro 2<br>
        Mage 1<br>
        Mage 2<br>
        ranger<br>
        <br>
        Group 4<br>
        Wizzie 1<br>
        wizzie 2<br>
        wizzie 3<br>
        Entanter 1<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        group 5<br>
        Cleric<br>
        cleric 2<br>
        cleric 3<br>
        enchanter<br>
        <br>
        Group 6<br>
        Druid 1<br>
        druid 2<br>
        druid 3<br>
        Shamen 1<br>
        shamen 2<br>
        <br>
        Now there is a reason to all of this and the groups aren't full why you 
        may ask and that is because of late comers and there always is some plus 
        groups do not need to e full in order to be effective this type of config 
        is used against Dragons and Gods etc<br>
        Why you may ask is well the tanks are all buffed before hand the Bards 
        are there to speed them up and to provide resistance against spells and 
        to make them stronger etc when they need healed they will run to the cleric 
        group for it.<br>
        <br>
        The pet casters will send in there pets and buff there pets into battle 
        first before the tanks once they start dieing the tanks go in while the 
        pet casters create more pets the druid throw in the odd missile and throw 
        heals to the tanks keeping them buffed the shamans do the same and also 
        make pets and send them in as well<br>
        <br>
        the wizzies wait till about 20% health of the mo and are there to finish 
        off the mob the chanters keep all the casters mana up and on certain most 
        drain the mana from them in order to stop them casting their spells or 
        to stop them healing themselves now this group strategy is for UBER mobs 
        only<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Strategy 2<br>
        <br>
        Group 1<br>
        Warrior<br>
        Warrior 2<br>
        Monk<br>
        Pally<br>
        Cleric<br>
        Bard<br>
        <br>
        Group 2<br>
        Wizzie<br>
        Chanter<br>
        Mage<br>
        Necro<br>
        SK<br>
        Druid<br>
        <br>
        Now this is common for large mobs with big hits ie over 130 dmg.<br>
        <br>
        The tank group take on the mo with the raid for speed and str and all 
        buffs coming from cleric and druid with the cleric healing the tanks during 
        battle<br>
        the caster let the mob drop a little then they blast it with an SK to 
        take the mo off them when agro and the druid for healing<br>
        <br>
        Strategy 3<br>
        <br>
        Group 1<br>
        Tank<br>
        Tank<br>
        Healer<br>
        Blaster<br>
        Pet Class<br>
        Backup healer (shammie druid)<br>
        <br>
        Group 2+ same as group 1<br>
        <br>
        this group is used to for raids on normal creatures when u want to take 
        over a zone etc<br>
        <br>
        hope this helps somewhat<br>
