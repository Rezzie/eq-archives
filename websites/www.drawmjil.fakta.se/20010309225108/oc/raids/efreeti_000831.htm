      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Well, there was an
          Efreetiraid today, and I just wanted to tell everyone who wasent there
          what happened.<br>
          <br>
          First, the Efreeti was camped. Or, well, there was a group there
          before us that WAS going to raid him, so the raid was called off.
          Then, the group inside got whacked, so we, the big Old contitnet, went
          in and took over. Insekta and Agravain organized the event. GREAT job
          guys, really. I was impressed with the authority, especially from the
          normaly chitt-chatt-easy-going Agravain (Shadowdark) who went in and
          dominated the guildchat channel and took complete control.<br>
          <br>
          Ok, everyone zoned in and set up camp in RIght room in solb. Groups
          where formed, and the actual raiding started. Me move with good speed
          inside. Unforrtunate, some causualities happened during the way, but
          got quickly ressed by Drutten. And, after alot of imp and Elemental
          barshing, all three groups finally made it to the room.<br>
          <br>
          All was happy, that a bad sign, happy people usually get careless.
          Well, I (Drawmjil) was told to pull. I must say, I have never been
          more affraid, and worked up, in my entire Ogrelife. I crawled outside
          and saw a imp. The imp saw me to and got the imp and his ugly brother
          back to the squash-team, and we squashed them good.<br>
          <br>
          Next, I was sent out again. I sttod there loking and tried to figure
          out if I sould puu ajnother imp (wich I saw) or just leave it alone.
          The next thing I see is something furry under my feet, wich, after
          closer inspection, turned out to be Pesta. When I look up, I see 3
          lavaelementals, and only Rallos know how many Imps. I quickly retreted
          back to group to get som help (BIG MISSTAKE). Needless to say, du to
          my lack of experience I managed to whipe out my entire guild, more
          about that later.<br>
          <br>
          Trowser the Hero came on for Corpse recovery, he bite the dust twice
          in the process, but finally all came back, and Invasmani ressurected
          everyone.<br>
          <br>
          COnclusions:<br>
          1. If you are a tank and get a bad pull, STAY AND DIE. I have read
          this as many times as I have levels, but STILL, when the situation
          occours, panic mode is initiated. A good puller needs to know when its
          time to go back, and when its time to die. That is why Warriors should
          not do pulling on higher levels, but leave that to monks or SK's.<br>
          <br>
          2. Dont spam the guildsay, I think we where about 98% diciplined in
          that on yesterdays raid, but this cant be said enough times.<br>
          <br>
          3. READ THE GUILDSAY (or OOC if multiguild raid). All the information
          on this channel are crucial information from the warlord, and the
          warlord expects everyone to follow theese orders within seconds.<br>
          <br>
          4. If the warlord ask questions on the guildsay (example: Manareport),
          give the answer in GOURPSAY so that your groupleader can report to the
          warlord.<br>
          <br>
          5. USE assist, no matter if everyone is going to die and the mobs are
          all over the place, ASSIST the targeter, the clerics heal the
          enchanters, and the chanters try to control the crowd. I can think of
          one exception here, that is when someone really tells you to go save
          the chanter. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, but thats
          the order I got from Lysaer on the last raid at least. (Chanters will
          try to STUN the mop that is hitting them, and then mess them, if you
          interfere, you can be darn sure you are going to break that mess).<br>
          <br>
          6. Bring highlevel enchanters, the ARE, no matter what anyone says,
          crucial for a succesfull raid.<br>
          <br>
          Well, to summarize, please, read the POH guides before tomorrow guys,
          I wont be there since I am to small, but BE prepared. I had a great
          time on this raid, thanks for having me there. And thanks for all the
          comforting tells about 'Naa, not your fault mate!', it helped, I was
          feelin quite useless when I woke up in Oggok, I can tell you that.<br>
          <br>
          Even though we didnt get any boots, it was GREAT training, at least
          for me, and I hope that the evenings experiences will help all of us
          in future raids.<br>
          <br>
          Good luck in hate guys!</font></td>
