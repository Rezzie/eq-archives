              </i><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="1">Just a short post on
              the Lady Vox raid last night. It was fear - everyone died, but it
              was fun! Area cold spell sucked a bubble of health every 5-10
              seconds if you go near her. Pets start acting up and attacking on
              random.<br>
              <br>
              I suppose Trowser should have some nice screendumps from the raid
              since he was lying Feign Death under her claws and fangs for over
              half an hour while we were getting &quot;organised&quot;.<br>
              <br>
              A word on organisation. Wizzer from &lt;Terror Reign&gt; pulled
              the lot together. My good old guild leader from &lt;Masters of
              Magic&gt; by the way. People were not paying attention and alot of
              people were chatting aloud in OOC and shouts making it a 30 min.
              job to group - alot of people were /anon and couldn't understand
              why the groups couldn't be formed. After 30 min or so everyone was
              grouped, but big surprise: we had only one enchanter and the
              healing crew was way too little. A little note on strategy for the
              Lady is, that she can cast 3 complete heals. The enchanters are
              crusial for mana draining her, so she cannot do CH. We only had
              one enchanter and she was level 43, and only one cleric level 49+
              didn't make the resses any easier...<br>
              <br>
              Cleaning the ice giants and Ice Terrors were easy enough and only
              the brave puller Kivann from &lt;Nightmares Asylum&gt; died once
              in a bad pull. Besides having problems with a buggy gate which
              kept getting people stuck this went smoothly... more enchanters
              were called in, but not up to what we needed it seemed.<br>
              <br>
              Then we spend an hour buffing... and learning about buffing when
              fighting Lady Vox. First take all the crappy useless buffs which
              you can hold like see invis, levitate, and tons of shaman stat
              buffs. Then put on the cleric HP/AC buffs or druids Skin buffs.
              Then finally have the Resist magic and Resist Cold. Since Lady Vox
              will do group dispelling, you need to have the most important
              buffs on you last.<br>
              <br>
              Organisation also failed here and people were running doing
              nothing and eventually the buffs on started fading and had to be
              redone. Too many unexprienced guys like myself and way too many
              people making mistakes, not paying attention to the right people
              and making wise cracks in OOC. At this point Crumb and Kivann from
              &lt;NA&gt; took over and people started listening...<br>
              <br>
              The approach on Lady Vox was easy enough. Healers and casters wait
              out side and sit and med with bards playing sweet mana music for
              them. Melee fighters run in and fight ... close combat with the
              sweet Lady leaves alot of people dead quickly, some other running
              around in terror and fear, which is also an area effect spell
              hitting all in the vicinity. Once beaten on to a near death, a
              fighter runs to the band of clerics outside and get heals for
              another slamming, bashing, slashing at the big Lady inside.<br>
              <br>
              Casters are quite useless unless they have pets to send into the
              chaos in the Lair. I suppose we casters can be used in some kind
              of &quot;finish&quot; of the last 20-30% of her health, but I was
              near her and just died far too quickly from her AoE spells.<br>
              <br>
              Receipt seem like 8-15 healers with a majority of clerics with
              complete heal. 30-35 fighters going head strong with her. 6
              enchanters doing mana drain. For buffing and 2ndary healing
              shamans, druids, and bards. Casters seemed quite useless to me,
              but if anyone know their strategy, please follow up.<br>

              Well , after 3 days of trying
              , a lucky few of us actually got to fight Cazic Thule.<br>
              <br>
              We WON!<br>
              <br>
              It was a very exciting , but ultimately spoiled raid . I will
              explain.<br>
              <br>
              If you go to Fear you will die a lot , pretty simple really , the
              raid was not very well planned and many many mistakes were made by
              the raid leader Nitross.<br>
              <br>
              He did a fair job , but was over keen and again , spent far to to
              much time with people sitting around waiting for corpse recovery
              ;- this generally means that the ones left alive are very
              vulnerable to wandering mobs.<br>
              <br>
              Finally (and this is the part that REALLY sucks) , we took two
              hours buffing/killing respawns/rebuffing/killing respawns etc
              before rushing Cazic.<br>
              <br>
              The fight lasted a few minutes , no more , about 50% of the brave
              souls died (Cazic hits for double 400s BTW , so casters that get
              hit , say your prayers).<br>
              <br>
              I missed Cazic actually fall , I died when he was on a sliver of
              HP , and missed it , but I got back in time to see his corpse.<br>
              <br>
              Cazic dropped Bloodfire(sword) , Earthcaller(staff) a shied and a
              necklace.<br>
              Both THE SHIELD AND NECKLACE WERE NINJA LOOTED.<br>
              <br>
              Nobody admitted to it , but I have certain suspicions surrounding
              Nitross and Kastur , both of whic made some pretty lame
              assertations trying to deflect the issue.<br>
              <br>
              Suffice to say I was mad.Very mad.<br>
              <br>
              I spent 3 days and died 17 times in total trying to get a shot at
              some planes drops , getting some knowledge of the zone and for the
              kudos of going to fear.<br>
              <br>
              To be robbed of the opportunity to even roll on a caster drop from
              Cazic was awful ;-not just for me but for all the others.For Trow
              , Morg , Kanien and myself it was a huge insult ;- we all stayed
              up until daylight to join in the final push.<br>
              <br>
              On the plus side I only lost 3 bubbles of 51 after rezzes and did
              gain a great deal of knowledge of the zone layout.<br>
              <br>
              But I will watch Nitross very carefully in the future , and if he
              suddenly starts wearing Cazics necklace , I will make sure every
              EQ player on Povar knows how he got it.<br>
