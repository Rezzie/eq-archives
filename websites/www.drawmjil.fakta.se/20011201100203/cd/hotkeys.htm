      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
        of you may or may not have come across these commands. I'm sure you can 
        see where these will or will not be useful.<br>
        <br>
        A word of advice is to turn off as much text as you can deem crap. E.g. 
        I'm not interested in anyone else's hits and misses so these are turned 
        off. That way you can keep an easy track on what people r saying during 
        battle.<br>
        <br>
        DOABILITY.<br>
        <br>
        This is a very useful command. What it does is do one of the ability u 
        have assigned under your abilities screen. I think they go like this<br>
        <br>
        1 2<br>
        3 4<br>
        5 6<br>
        <br>
        If I have Sense Heading in slot 1 I have a macro that not only does my 
        sense heading but also my location. So assign a macro key with the following 
        two lines:<br>
        <br>
        /doability 1 (line 1)<br>
        /Loc (line 2)<br>
        <br>
        /CAST &amp; %T<br>
        The /cast command is used to cast spells 1 through to 8. The %T variable 
        can be used in text and will state what the current target is. Now these 
        have uses for a number of people. For pulling you might have a macro that 
        reads:<br>
        <br>
        /G INC INC INC Its ............. %T<br>
        <br>
        That would then inform the group that not only you're coming back but 
        also what you have pulled (well on singles anyhow).<br>
        <br>
        Now combine this with the cast command. As an enchanter this has uses 
        when perhaps I'm just about to try and charm something. So I would have 
        a macro set-up to read (assume the charm spell is in spell slot 1)<br>
        <br>
        /Cast 1 (line1)<br>
        /g Attempting to Charm ....... %t (line2)<br>
        <br>
        These command also have uses when two of the same caster classes r either 
        grouped or within the team. That way they can inform the other caster 
        what spell your casting on what mob.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
