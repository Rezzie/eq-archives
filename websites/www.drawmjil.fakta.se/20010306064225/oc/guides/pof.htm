        Nife.</b></font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Okay, this is the scoop that so many
        people have been waiting to hear. I can't tell you how many people ask
        me in game Perdunk just how do you do it. Well.. it is way to complex to
        explain in a tell or a say. And it is too dangerous just to try and show
        someone as it is going on. So let me see if I can accomplish the
        impossible and explain to everyone just what fear plane is all about.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First of all, lets try to describe the
        make of fear<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>plane and how
        you must think of it as you are entering<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>or walking about. There are numberous mobs in there and each
        pretty much has its own section of the zone. Each section is made up of
        roamers and stationary targets. For this writing im going break the zone
        down into 7 sections. Fear itself is basically one big square pied out
        into those 7 sections. Unless you spend hours apon hours in the zone you
        will probably only see parts of 3 secs while your puller might acutally
        spent a great deal of time in 5 section. There are 2 sections of the
        zone that are just extremely hard and more then like youll never get to
        (sorry druids, warrior, and Sks because the bulk of you drops are in
        these two hardest sections to get<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>too).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Time for everyone to switch their
        minds into a gemometric kind of view</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As you break in, the safest spot to start
        out at (and we will call this the SW corner or Camp 1) is Camp 1. This
        is absolutely the hardest single one thing for a group to do, that is
        getting the mass numbers you need to this spot so you can make your
        presence know. You see the gate in or portal is the apex of 3 of the
        section. Roamers from the first 3 sections like to meet up at the
        portal. So when you zone if your not careful, fast and have a head on
        your shoulders it is very possible that you attract mobs that roam from
        all three sections. Which isnt fun because once you do this you have
        effectively stired up the zone and make it twice as hard to get in. So
        people say you need to go in with invis, invis undead, and invis
        animals, but in my opinion this doesnt work at all if you make it to
        camp one that way its because you happen to have caught the mobs in
        there open spot as they roam to other locations in there repective
        section. You see when a mob roams it moves for about 30 secs then stops
        and looks around then decides to move again to there next nav point in
        their section (standing still time is about 30 secs also).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The three sections that you deal with
        when you first zone is a long strech the goes from portal past the
        yellow scareling town through all the boggiemen to the back gorgon nest,
        then there is the portal section or about 5-6 mobs that acutally spend
        their whole life circling the portal (the meanist being the singlar
        scareling in that section), and last of the first three sections that
        you encounter is the section that goes from the portal past the Fited
        house back along the fire wall till you reach the section that houses
        Cazic himself. The mobs you will encounter that roam to toward the
        portal are Scarelings (huge argo radius 1 in portal section 1-2 in
        boggie section, and 2-3 in section that leads to cazic), spine chiller
        spiders found in portal area and section to cazic, Shiverback apes found
        in portal area and section leading to cazic, Fited fiends found in all
        three areas, Amygladan warriors found in portal area and boggie section.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Okay now that you know the make up.
        Easiest way to make it to SW corner or camp 1 is to first try to take in
        a group of 12-18 that acutally know where this spot is so they can get
        there quickly. Then dont bum rush the spot with all 18 becuase you know
        people just arent made to walk in tight groups. Go one at a time where
        at all possible with other trying to let people behind them know how the
        gap in the 3 sections just are. Then zone in. One you have zoned in do a
        turn to you left head to the spot just next to portal and look down if
        you see nothing on hill to your right or left then run straight down til
        you hit zone wall. Once at zone wall you need to STOP LOOK AND LISTEN
        (this is very important to everyone in your group). If you see nothing
        coming at you (make sure you relize scarelings have a huge argo area and
        you might not see them on your tail at first) head slowly to camp 1
        hugging the zone wall all the way there. Along the way there alway take
        a time out to make sure you are not draging anything with you. If you
        happen to pick up something along the way for god shakes dont run it to
        the Camp 1 spot. Dont run off into the zone just gracefully sit there
        and try to gate out. If you cant just die right there and when you try
        to come back in again to get to camp 1 spot just corpse your body with
        you. If people do die it is very important that you tell them to FORGET
        about their corpse they will get it later as zone clears a bit. Last
        thing you need is people wandering around the zone once they are in and
        already at the camp 1 spot.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Okay you have assembled your army at camp
        1 (what ever the numbers may be. the more people the better but i would
        suggest at least 18 people if you want to mark that spot as your
        permantly but you can pull it off with 12 people). Time to set up the
        camp 1 rules:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">#1 no one leaves the spot.. always
            keep your pulls as far up in the spot as possible and avoide runners</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">#2 if you get feared or teleported.
            Stand there like you were coming in for the first time and make sure
            you having picked up anything else if you have been fun having you
            in the group but you better die or gate out and we will let you know
            when its safe to try to come back in. Dont not run hrough out the
            zone you maybe with out your corpse till your puller things its okay
            for him to drag it back to you, which could be a long time.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">#3 Dont bicker in OOC about who isnt
            or is in your group at the time or what the loot order is. Most
            important thing right now is killing about 7-9 mobs so if you do die
            you can come back in safely. Just keep your mind on the killing
            machine and bicker in your repective groups till you are safely out
            of camp 1 when there is more time to have coversations because zone
            is about to be mastered.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">#4 DO NOT succor or evac unless you
            absolutely have too because if you can take a couple of death or
            maybe even have the entire party wiped out but you get that extra
            mob that normally you wouldnt of because you succored it makes the
            take over of the zone alot easier because once again zone back in if
            you die is that much easier.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now that the primary of the rules are
        made up and everyone is itching to get to bisness its time to pull. The
        puller should be someone that you trust and that you know if they will
        die before they bring back too much stuff to the group. This could be
        someone of any class. Although i prefer clerics over any other class
        because (opps i forgot to mention the Worry worts that are in section
        portal and boggie) if a frog jumps them they can DA (devine aura) so
        that on the way back with pull the frog cannt evoke fear them all over
        the zone. But im sure each person has their ideal of which class makes
        the best puller. And it really doesnt matter as long as the puller
        always acts with the group best interest over their own.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Okay now the puller jumps down from camp
        1 and begin to look. Never pull anything from the sectioin leading back
        to boggies and imp tower. Imp tower is a bad thing because some times
        there is 4-5 imps sitting there having lunch. always try to pull singles
        from some where in between portal and and up to but not including the
        fited house in the section leading to cazic. Be patient you might have
        to wait for some stuff to come into that area but who are we kidding we
        arent in a marathon here we wanna clear and stay alive</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Okay going forwar lets say you have now
        successfully killed about 9 mobs around the portal from parts of all
        three first sections. Now the puller uses his judgement to look around
        the portal area once you can detremine that there is no mobs between
        camp 1 and the fited area. Be patient again for the roamers to come to
        you and you should never move till you have at least killed about 9
        mobs. Its time to move to a spot we call Camp 2 or THE TREE. The
        location of camp to is along the zone wall on your left as you look at
        the portal from camp 1. It is a big open area that can fit 30 or more
        people confortably for then next saga of your POF exprience. Infact you
        will more then like spend the rest of your time in POF at camp TWO.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>At this time you can elect to do 1 of
        2 sections.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">*COMPLETELY FORGET ABOUT boggie section
        at the moment (once again sorry druids and bards we will get to your
        stuff eventually).*</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can either clear your way back to
        cazic and the cubes (there is another name for them but they look like
        huge cubes) or you can proceed to the next section or the section i call
        the dragon area (dracholice). If you pick back to cazic your are going
        make your mages happy if you pick dragon area youll make everyone but
        mages and bards happy. Normally becuase you get a lot of mage stuff at
        camp 1 i chose going to the dragon area becuase this area needs to be
        pretty dam clear before you think about going to the boggie area again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the dragon area thre really is only 2
        spots to pull from. The best spot is the ruin thing that is right next
        to hour glass bridge. *first thing you must clear for this spot is the
        2-3 tentcle terrors on the right side of hour glass bridge (merry xmas
        rangers). Then that pull spot is completely open to pull from. When you
        get so your standing in that spot just look back through the dragon area
        till you see the closest thing in spell cast range that is vertulally by
        itself so you continue with single pulls. You are not all ways going to
        get single pulls from there but i will tell you that you can out run
        Fiteds, warrios, knights so if you get alot of stuff coming at you just
        run and hope only the fastest stuff comes the other slow stuff will
        retrun to spot till you get close to that spot again (this is called
        auto pull and ill explain about that in a bit). Just keep pulling from
        that spot next to ruin till you no longer can see a mob in spell cast
        range. 2nd spot in this area is just ahead of you the hump at the bottom
        of the hill you cant see over (very dangerous spot, in fact this spot
        kills me so many time becuase before you can see whats over the hill 4
        frogs jump you and its all over *rememer da*) Another thing you have to
        watch out for while in dragon area is the dragon himself. Never pull
        from this area when dragon is up from because it will wander back to the
        back of hte area soon enough. This is when i take the time to switch
        between dragon area and section that leads to cazic.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once you have the large amout of dragon
        area cleared you can start on boggie area, finish the to cazic area or
        pull the dragon himself. I would advis that you fisrt clear the begining
        of boggie area and the major part of to cazic area before pulling the
        dragon so you dont get area feared into bringing more mobs back with you
        while fighting the dragon.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Okay to start the pull in boggie area..
        you are standing on the spot you started pulliing dragon area and you
        turn to your right you see a house. In this house is 3 mobs. They all
        will come and they will be either all boggie men or a mixture of boggie
        men and samhains. Careful you can out run all these mobs and you wil
        have to kind of stop go hand feed them your flesh on the way back to
        camp 2 for the pull. Once you have pulled the boggie house. ITs time for
        your group to med up full with their buffs becuase the imp tower is
        next. While attempting to pull the imp tower you just kind of try to get
        as close as possible without acutally hitting any of the imps you will
        usually get 2-3 imps if you pray kill those and go back for the last 2-3
        imps. Then the back side or boggie area is open for you to wander
        through and pull singles. Always remember the pathing in PoF is not just
        smack and run becuase mobs dont care how you get to where your going
        they will go on their own lil pathing area unless your are feeding flesh
        all the way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once you have cleared PORTAL, TO CAZIC,
        DRAGON, and BOGGIE sections you can either move in closer with group to
        a spot of your choosing to the gorgon next in back or you can start to
        pull the CAZIC section himself. *CAZIC has a HT that will kill someone
        with 2133 hps instantly so be careful when pulling from cazic area
        because his argo range is the largest of all mobs. Once you have gotten
        all the stuff from cazic area and cleared the back section or gorgan
        nest area you are ready for the 7th and hardest section.Remeber at all
        times you havent cleared cazic area because if you bring cazic you will
        bring the entire zone because he calls them all. 7th area is the temple
        behind the fire wall. Best thing to do to pull this area is to send
        someone with good magic resist through the fire wall near the fited
        house (camp 2). You will get HTed by all the knights in temple and
        cuasing a auto pull because i dont suggest you stick around but beat
        feat back to camp 2. Nothing will mostly come because you out ran them
        just start heading back to cazic along firewall youll see one and two
        knights/warriors coming most times till you clear the temple.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Now once you clear the zone ...
        good luck you are are ready for cazic. I say good luck because my server
        has yet to kill him and it will be along time before we do probably
        becuase by the time you get to this point you have been in fear for 12
        hours and stuff is already respawning. AND OR people have come and gone
        and your numbers are depleted.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>AUTO PULL</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Auto pull happens when you out run
        something back to pull spot or for what ever reason something that
        argoed you didnt follow you back off pull but returned to thier spots in
        thier section. Once this happens they transfer the argo flag to
        everything around them. So when you get into a range witch you willl
        have to determine through your own test, stuff just comes at you.
        Normally in ones or 2's depending on how deep you are.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In closing i would like to say i also use
        my sould to pick up the dopplar effect the mobs are making so i can tell
        if there is a mob coming or going near me. And good luck to all servers
        i hope this helps.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>BE KIND TO YOUR PULLER</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is not unlikely that they will die
        repeatedly in a matter of mins.</font></p>
