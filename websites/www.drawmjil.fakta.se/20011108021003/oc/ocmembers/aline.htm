        It was a cold dark night in the city of Erudin where I had lived when I
        was 4.&nbsp; I was in my bed trying to sleep but there was no way that I
        could. Everyone else in the city was asleep but me.&nbsp; I then heard
        noises sort of like soft barking.&nbsp; I hopped out of bed and looked
        out my window.&nbsp; Was lay before my eyes was terrifying.&nbsp; Spread
        through the city were a legion of kobold warriors, shaman, and archers
        all preparing for a surprise attack on the city.&nbsp; I ran to my
        parents room and woke them up and told them to look out their
        window.&nbsp; They looked puzzled but did look out the window.&nbsp;
        They&nbsp;<br>
        nearly screamed with fright.&nbsp; Both of them razed to my fathers
        study.&nbsp; He tapped on a magical mirror on his wall 3 times and then
        said a magical word I couldn't understand.&nbsp; An old man was shown in
        the mirror.&nbsp; I recognized him to be the leader of the Erudites.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Why do you wake me in the middle of the night, Cryth.&quot; Said
        the man.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;You told me to use this mirror only for emergencies and this is
        one.&nbsp; Look outside your window.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        The man looked outside his window and stared in shock.<br>
        He returned to the mirror and said, &quot;I will magically rouse the
        sentinels and townsmen able to fight and tell them to take their secret
        passages to the guildhall.&nbsp; The kobolds couldn't have gotten into
        there because it is so well magically protected.&nbsp; You wake the
        wizards, enchanters, magicians, and other magical people we have.&nbsp;
        Tell them to immediately report to their guildhalls.&nbsp; The masters
        will be they're waiting to give instructions.&nbsp; Tell all the women
        and children to gather around the guild's bank.&nbsp; And remember to
        tell you to use their teleporters.&nbsp; No one can be seen or will be
        done for.&quot;<br>
        My mother and I ran to a room connected to my father's study that had a
        teleporter in it.&nbsp; Every house had a similar room for emergencies
        like these.&nbsp; We stepped into the teleporter while my father stayed
        behind to wake up everyone he was suppose to.&nbsp; We appeared at a
        teleport marker in the guildhall next to the bank.&nbsp; My mother and I
        moved aside so other people could teleport to the spot.&nbsp; After
        about 2 hours, all the warriors were in the guildhall ready for battle,
        the wizards were in their guilds ready for battle as well, and the
        mothers and children were ready to take there secret&nbsp;<br>
        passage to the docks and get as many people on boats so we could get
        reinforcements.&nbsp; The leader gave the signal.&nbsp; My mother and I
        went with all the other mothers and children through a dark and dirty
        secret underground passage.&nbsp; We could hear the war going on above
        our heads.&nbsp; Everybody was silently praying for their family and
        running through the passage.&nbsp; We came up right at the docks and
        lucky for us only a few kobolds were there.&nbsp; The mothers who knew
        some magic disposed of the few creatures quickly.&nbsp; We loaded
        everybody onto the boats and then set sail toward Qeynos.&nbsp; We
        arrived at Qeynos the next day and went directly to Antonios
        Bayle.&nbsp; He listened to us and then decided to help.&nbsp; He picked
        500 men and sent them to reclaim Erudin from the kobolds.&nbsp; The
        mothers and children were given shelter in inns throughout the vast
        city.&nbsp; We waited for 5 days but there had still been no word from
        the men that had been sent to fight.&nbsp; Finally, on the 7th day a
        small boat sailed back bearing news.&nbsp; The leader of the ship first
        went to talk with Antonios while the other men of the ship posted the
        men that were alive and the men that had been killed in battle in the
        city square.&nbsp; The families were scared to look at the piece of
        parchment, including my mother and I.&nbsp; A few families finally
        stepped forward to look at the parchment.&nbsp; Two families started
        giving uncontrollable sobs because their fathers and husbands had
        died.&nbsp; My mother finally went over to look at the piece of
        parchment that read: Alive.&nbsp; There were only about 60 of the 500
        men that had fought on the list.&nbsp; She went down the list one by one
        looking for my father's name.&nbsp; She was down to the 55th person and
        had not seen her husband's name.&nbsp; She couldn't read any more so I
        took over.&nbsp; 56, 57, 58, 59... still no name.&nbsp; Then 60: Cryth
        Griffonfeather.&nbsp; I yelped with joy.<br>
        &quot;Mother, Mother I yelled.&nbsp; Father is alive!&quot;<br>
        We both started crying.&nbsp; Tears of joy coming down our faces.&nbsp;
        We were so happy that he was alive.&nbsp; The men from the boat who had
        posted the messages said that the survivors would be in Erudin resting.<br>
        Later that day the first boat left from Qeynos to return to Erudin and
        work on repairs.&nbsp; My mother and I were on it.<br>
        After about 6 months, Qeynos was restored.&nbsp; There was a tremendous
        celebration in the Town Square.&nbsp; Food, dances, games, magicians
        showing tricks to all the toddlers.&nbsp; During all this the leader of
        the Erudites came over to me and my family.&nbsp; He kneeled so he could
        talk to me.&nbsp;<br>
        &quot;Your father has told me that you were the ones that woke them up
        and told them that the Kobolds were here is that right?&quot; the man
        asked.<br>
        I nodded my head.<br>
        &quot;You have saved this entire city and many lives.&nbsp; You will
        surely be&nbsp;<br>
        rewarded for this great deed.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I will?&quot; I peeped.<br>
        &quot;Yes&quot; He stood up and asked my parents &quot;How they would
        like your daughter to learn a art of magic at the Academy in
        Erudin.&nbsp; She obviously has the abilities.&quot;<br>
        I was amazed.&nbsp; The Academy was a huge building with many wise
        teachers and it was just a wonderful place overall.&nbsp; It was a
        private Academy so only selected ones were aloud into it.&nbsp; It was
        the best academy in all of Norrath as well.&nbsp; My parents were even
        more amazed then me.&nbsp; They managed to say,&nbsp;<br>
        &quot;YES.&quot;<br>
        &quot;She can begin in a week.&nbsp; That will give you enough time to
        buy her&nbsp;<br>
        supplies.&quot; The man said.<br>
        I was so excited that night.&nbsp; I was going to the Academy of Erudin
        and I&nbsp; would be able to choose which art I would like to learn.<br>
        That will be easy, I have always wanted to grow up like my mom and
        dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        This was my chance.&nbsp; I was going to become a wizard.<br>
