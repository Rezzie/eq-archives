        <font size="2" face="Arial">Well, there are several ways to do a break
        on the Plane oh Hate. What I am going to describe here is the so called
        SW corner. What will happen is that everyone gather at the wizzard spires
        in SRO. Groups are formed, 5 people in the groups that dont have a
        wizzard for permanent grouping. The first group to go up consists of
        only the rouge and wizzard (eventually monk and/or sk that will immideatly feign death). The rouge will scout for the zonepatrol to go
        by and depop. When this happens, the rouge will tell the warlord to
        start the real porting. I will not go into how the groups are put
        togheter or anything. This guide is simpy ment go get evryone safely to
        the safespot (B3).</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ok, if you are reading this guide, it is
        probably because you have never been to Plane of hate before, and want
        to know what to do, not to screw you other fellow raidmemebers. Note,
        that this guide is only applicable if there will be a so called SW corner
        break. Well, look at the picture bellow.</font></p>

    <tr>
      <td valign="top" width="491">
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You will popup at the red '1', start
        running as the green lines indicates, keep close to the walls on the
        house where you
        spawned no to aggro mobs in house 3. Keep as high up on the zonewall as
        you possible can. When you get to approx point B1, stay for a short
        while and look around to make sure that you have'nt aggroed anything. Continue to B2, same as B1 here, a quick look around to make sure nothing
        is aggroed. Then proceed to B3 and wait here, as high up on the wall as
        possible (there should be several other waiting here).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you happen to catch a mob on the way,
        just stay and die, DONT try to get help or anything, if you can, try to
        camp (dont quit /q, CAMP). The rest of the raid will get you and rezz
        you. If you have the time, make a small note on OOC to let the rest of
        the raid know that you die (/ooc got aggro, waiting for death, trying to
        camp)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once on B3, stay there untill the warlord
        orders the charge, be sure you know who to assist, charge along the wall
        (with the rest of the people) along the wall and then down to the B2
        corner. Use assist and take out the mobs. Someone will surely start
        telling stuff on the OOC, probably the rouge ('add lich', 'add cleric'
        and stuff), that means new creature that got aggroed from the charge,
        this is normal, just keep you head cool and assist untill all creatures
        are dead.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After this, just follow instructions from
        the warlord... to be able to do this, shut everything off your
        chatfilter except says, tells, guildsay, ooc and shout... you NEED to
        know whats going on.... not if you hit the mob for 5 or 20 dmg...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When there is loot dropped, the warlord
        will call the classes down to the mob who have them to ditribute the
        loot. He will do that when everything is safe, dont run there untill you
        are requested to.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Happy hunt, and good luck on the rolls for armour (If you are not a warrior on the same raid as Drawmjil, in
        wich case I wish you VERY bad luck on the rolls ;-)</font></p>
