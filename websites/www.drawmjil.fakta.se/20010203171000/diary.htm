              city into harbor. Then two dorfs jumped on Annas attacking her,
              she run away with them du safe place when me pick up stuff. Then
              da VERY rude doggie started telling rude stuff to me and Annanas
              about dat we steal his dorfs and training him. Me cannot tell you
              huw upset me got. Me never get angry. Well, me usually never get
              angry, but meez can tell you, me got very angry at rude doggie. Me
              told him dat he was stupid, in the end he said he wus sorry, but
              me really nut likem dat attitude. Me try to help him , got killed,
              lost level and money fer buyin tele, Falloz die tu when trying tu
              help him, and what me get back? Rude yelling, both at me and meez
              precious whife, pretty Annanas. Bah, Mecahawk, learn manner, just

        tuday. Hapi was there tu, helpin us if da munsters got tu big. Then, suddenly stange thing
        happen, da DING sound was there. Me nuw season 29. Unly une seasun left untill meez axe
        start cast mojo on me. Sad thing happen yesterday tu. Big train of gnollies came. Me jump
        out of zone, but last thin me see was poor mojoman fightin gnollies alone. Name uf da
        mojoman was Finny. As soon as me jump uf zone me jump back in again to help da mojoman. He
        was bashing mojognoll so me jump da gnollie tu help Finny. Da gnoll cast charmmojo on
        Drawmjil, me started barshing Finny instead, me nut do on purpose, da mojo did that. Me
        though Finny was gonno jump frum zone so he be safe. He nut do that, he slay me instead,
        very easy kill, me had nut much hp left. He laughed tu when he did that, me nut think that
        very nice to kill people when they try help you. Me ask why he did that when me wake up,
        but he just said rude words back. Later, Hapi got kind cleric tu cast mojo on me so me not
        have to run all way from Oggok. Me not remember name of cleric, but if you read this, me
        wanna say thank you. Finny said he was sorry, but me guess thaz only because Hapi said to
        him he should say that, me think he was mean barshing me. Me bite him in leg a few times,
        then he got mad again. Me nu think biting in leg hurts as much as getting killed.</font><font

        thats first word uf advice. Second, if youz gonno brashem cylop, tell shaman in party NOT
        tu Buff cyclop. Tell shaman to buff you instead. Cylop will likem shaman if they get buff,
        they nut likem you. Last thing me wanna tel you, please, nut tell da Oggok bouncers me
        said this. The shamen in Oggok shamen guild se real person behind illusion, so if you
        gonno go to shaman guild, cast invismojo, nu illusion. If you smart, you can se that same
        person goto shamen with illusion and wakem up in Great faydark, har, har. Me nut gonno

        First me goto Windyfiremountin. Meet some new friends there, Ipren was there to, and two
        Ogre borthers, Gurnie and Gurney, and Lenthorn and Caladena. They vere gud hunting with,
        nice people, very fair and know what to do when hunt. Me hope we hunt togheter soon again.
        Later, me got call from Xtravagansa, he was in bonecrushermountin. He said if wantzed
        Dvinn heart to give to Lork to get Gatormashingstick me had to come get heart self. Me not
        like going on boat, me get seasick, and guards where boat is not likez Drawmjil. But me
        go, me brave. Nice man at docks, Manider, cast mojo on Drawmjil so that me was not seen.
        Me jump of boatd i butchermountin, swim and run to faydark. Me have advice to Ogre and
        Troll, not talk to guards, stay away from guards, thats me advice. Me mee Xtravagansa, he
        had little group and me join. Sily person in group called Ginween, did nothing usefull,
        flyingaround. Me not like him from start. We wait awhile, barshing Ogres. Then Dvinn was
        there, big hero Xtravagansa took him outside, slay him gud. Ginween took dirk from dvinn,
        saying he had right to dirk. Xtravagansa had explained to Ginween that he was to to have
        dirk, not Ginween. Ginween did not care, he was very rude, took dirk and sold it.
        Xtravagansa and rest of us was very upset, very. That is no honour, Ogres not have much
        honour, but we have lutz more honour than Ginween. Then Xtra killed Dvin again, me helped
        little to, me thinkz. Strange thing happened, alot of young people helped killing Dvinn,
        we saw that we had dirk Xtravagansa died in fight, then Dirk was suddnely gone. Xtra vas
        VERY upset now. Then little elfie voman spoke to me asking to whom dagger belonged, me was
        very supprised. Me told Eflie that Xtra wasited for dagger, and that he deserved it. Elfie
        called Cinae then did VERY honourable thing, she gave dirk to Xtra. Me felt proud being in
        same room with Cinae, she gud elf. Xtra very happy now, me very happy, me got heart. Me
        forgot to mention that Allko, Annanas and Bonanza got here to. When everything was done,
        we go home. Allko cast no-see-mojo on Drawmjil and we goto boat. When we came to freeport,
        me swim. Annanas the cast mojo on Drawmjli, so Drawmjil now lives in freeport. Me thinks
        it strange for Ogre to live in freeport, but me like it. Me then sleep, very tired, very
