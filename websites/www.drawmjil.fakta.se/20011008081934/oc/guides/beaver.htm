        <p><font size="2">Before you start the actual camping, and
        the higly saught after break of the camp, you must find the beaver. You
        should also take GREAT care assuring that IT is not allready camped.
        Ignoring this important part will probably give you lost factions, both
        with the beaver and, more important, the campholder, wich will probably
        challenge you to a duel.</font><p><font size="2">Once you
        have made sure that the beaver is not camped, set up you campspot well.
        A supply of alochol would be recomended here, as well as a high level of
        alchohol tollerance, since the Beaver usually dont approve of someone to
        drunk to do the actual break.</font><p><font size="2">Start
        by hailing the beaver, and then start pulling slowly. A slow but steady
        pull is of the essance here, no chargin in type of breaks have ever
        become succesfull to my knowledge. This will acutally raise your
        faction with the beaver. When you have pulled for a while you know
        when it is time for the big BREAK of the camp. You will know that when
        you hear:<br>
        A giant beaver_00 says: 'You will not evade me Drawmjil!'</font><p>
        <font size="2">Now,
        the actual break, when you hear the words above you will be summoned to
        the beaver, a word of advice here: DONT PANIC. There are a couple of
        breakins methods here, some like to just charge the beaver with
        everything the got and just Nuke the living hell out of it. Even though
        this method actually might give you experience, will, I promise, lower
        you faction with beaver drastically. Soo, how do I do it you might ask?
        Well, the simple answer is kiting, the longer you can kite it around
        (around, up and down),
        and wait for the final big Ice-coment to go off, the better you faction
        will become, the better experience you will get. There is also rumoured
        that the kiting time affects the loottables, but that has yet to be
        confirmed.</font><p><font size="2">Ok, once the beaver
        looks ready for that last and very important nuke; DO IT, if you are not
        a wizzard and got that fancy Icecommet (wich, by the way, impresses the
        living daylight out of most beavers), use the most powerfull nuke you
        have. Getting the beaver with a DOT will not impress anyone, especially
        not the beaver.</font><p><font size="2">Once the nuke is off
        and the beaver is laying there panting. Get some rest, you will need it
        for the looting, and for the next breakin. And also, get that alcohol, preferably Elven red wine
        and train some alcohol tollerance.</font><p><font size="2">Now,
        for the afterwork, if you have done this correctly, you faction with
        the beaver have gone up, probably alot depending of how succesfull the
        kiting was. You will
        now have a better chance for your next camp, especially of you intend
        to camp the same beaver again. A god tip is to wait for the next spawn
        again as soon as you feel that you are ready for it, the respawntime is
        about 28 minutes. If you are a cleric, you can speed that up by actually
        ressing the beaver.</font><p><font size="2">Now, a couple of
        words of advice, CONSIDER the beaver before you start camping (/con), if
        the beaver cons green (A giant beaver looks at you warmly - looks like
        you would win this fight), it WILL indeed be a easy camp. The problem
        with it is, obviusly you will not get any XP. The other things that have
        been implemented is that the easy-to-get beavers have a disease proc
        than they cast. The spell will make you regret camping that beaver, I
        can promise you that. No! I say, go for the blue, reds instead. The best
        thing you can do is to find a white (even con) beaver, the will get you
        the most out of the camp.</font><p><font size="2">Well, one
        last note: When you have succesfully camped the beaver and gotten
        whatever loot or experince from it. DONT GO BRAG ABOUT IT IN OOC OR
        SHOUT (Falloz?). I would not even recomend guildsay or grouptell. You can use
        occational tell to you closest friends, but I would leave it to that.</font><p>
        <font size="2">Good
        luck to all of you, if you need any help, give Daddy Drawmjil a tell on
        povar!</font><p>&nbsp;
