      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Group leaders</font></u><br>
        Group leaders are the only group members who may talk in guild chat during 
        the raid they do so giving mana reports, LD reports and relaying other 
        group information. During the battle the group leader should know most 
        of the time what his group members are doing so he can control the battle 
        performance of his group to some degree. This includes telling the healers 
        to heal when he/she thinks that is taking too long or telling the casters 
        to help the healer or chanter out. A group leader should, during a battle, 
        take a few seconds every now and then to assess the situation and make 
        sure everyone is performing his/her duties to the best of their abilities. 
        After a battle a group leader may evaluate the battle with the group and 
        point out things that went well or things that went bad.<br>
        <font color="#FF6600"><br>
        <u> Group melee classes</u></font><br>
        Your main job is to trust your party members. You have to trust your puller 
        to be on the right target you have to trust your healers to heal you in 
        time, you have to trust your enchanter to mezz the mobs you are not fighting 
        and you have to trust your casters to kill a mob once you have agro-ed 
        it enough. You always assist the raid puller and never select a target 
        of your own even when assist is taking a while to work. You never ever 
        switch targets unless your puller does (hit assist once in every while 
        to make sure you are still on the same target) or your group leader or 
        the raid warlord says to switch targets to &lt;insert mob name here&gt;.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Group main healer</font></u><br>
        Their main job is to med uuuuh heal I mean. A group main healer should 
        do nothing except heal and even med through most fights if no healing 
        in the battle is required. Never heal too early except in emergencies 
        because this will agro the mob(s) on you and throw the battle into disarray. 
        Never heal too late either for obvious reasons. Preferably heal between 
        fights or depending the situation start healing when someone goes below 
        40% health or when you see someone's health drop dramatically, you better 
        watch those health bars till you have tears running down your cheeks. 
        A main healer should only cast buffs when he/she is full mana or at least 
        very high mana, depending the situation and the importance of the buff.<br>
        <font color="#FF6600"><br>
        <u> Group secondary healer</u></font><br>
        This is often a druid or a shaman and this role leaves a lot of room for 
        the player to decide what course of action to take. They should buff their 
        party members before a battle and they can melee and cast offensive spells 
        in the beginning of a battle. Their main job is to leave at least 50% 
        of their mana to heal party members when the main healer goes OOM. Furthermore 
        its their job to keep the group main healer and enchanter alive by healing 
        them or aggro-ing/killing the mob's) on them, depending the situation. 
        This is the only valid reason for a secondary healer to agro a mob. In 
        all other situations they should have their hands free to cast heals. 
        If you agro the mob you were assisting on YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Group casters</font></u><br>
        These are wizards, necromancer and magician types. Magicians and necro's 
        can send their pets in the moment they are sure they have the right target 
        (by assisting the puller of course). Furthermore it is best to look at 
        yourself as a finisher as soon as the mob drops below (approx) two third 
        of its health you kill with some big damage. Of course this doesn't work 
        in every situation and good judgment is needed to know when to cast what. 
        Furthermore your job is to protect the group healer and enchanter. If 
        the group main healer is under attack but the chanter still has his/her 
        hands free leave it to the chanter and keep assisting the puller. It is 
        often hard to know when to help the enchanter, first look at his/her health 
        bar if it is getting low fast you better start wasting mana big time to 
        pull the mobs off the chanter. Only when helping the group main healer 
        and enchanter do these caster classes have a valid reason to agro a mob. 
        If you agro the mob you were assisting on YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.<br>
        <br>
        <u>2) Class roles:</u><br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Bard</font></u><br>
        Bards are a bit hard to class but are still a melee class in my book. 
        They truly excel in reducing a group downtime. They are hard to play because 
        their group buffs tend to agro mobs a lot. So depending the situation 
        a bard should probably decide to melee or play group buff songs and not 
        do both.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Cleric</font></u><br>
        If present he/she becomes the group main healer because that is what they 
        do best. If mana permits they also have some of the best defense buffs 
        going, but they should never be used at the expense of healing. This guy 
        is literally a life saver, be nice to them.<br>
        <font color="#FF6600"><br>
        <u> Druid</u></font><br>
        Can pose as main healer but their preferred role is secondary healer. 
        They can also melee and have excellent snares to keep the mobs where you 
        want them.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Enchanter</font></u><br>
        Well I am sure whole books can be written about enchanters but basically 
        they do crowd control. They are one of the reasons why it is very important 
        everybody uses assist.&nbsp;</font> 
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Enchanter should only speed buff people when they are full mana or at 
        least very high mana. Breeze and Clarity should be cast and maintained 
        on all group casters and primary and secondary healer and if mana permits 
        on the hybrid melee classes. Preferably an enchanter casts mezz if multiple 
        mobs were pulled then meds, casts mezz again, meds, mezz ad infinitum.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Magician</font></u><br>
        Caster class, with a pet. this pet can be a great asset to the group BUT 
        it can also kill you if you don't watch it very careful. the first thing 
        you should do is make 4 fast keys for&nbsp; /pet back off,&nbsp; /pet 
        kill, /pet as you where and last but not least /assist, the assist key 
        is actually something that everyone should have, this key should also 
        be edited on every raid so that you have one /assist &lt;Name of the main 
        puller&gt; and one /assist without a name to use on any other that you 
        need to assist.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
        as a magician and Necromancer you should sent in the pet in an early stage 
        and always keep an eye on him, if you are in a dungeon also always have 
        Invisible memmed so that you can kill the pet if it runs of and gets out 
        of your range. The pet can also be used to help you escape if everything 
        goes really bad, Just let the pet taunt the Mob and make sure everyone 
        else is on their way out of there, then you just gate out and let the 
        pet hold the mob of you, remember the pet is expendable.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
        now a little thing about pets.<br>
        Fire: Weak pet with good fire dmg shield, best used in a big group where 
        the pet take none to just a little damage.<br>
        Water: a good all-round pet, to use when working together with a Necro 
        or anyone else that can slow down and fear a mob. also best used when 
        the pet isn't the main tank. (yes you can use pets as main tanks.)<br>
        Earth: The best Solo pet but also good in group where you don't have anyone 
        else that can slow down or root the mob, Don't use this pet when kiting 
        a mob together with a Necro or druid the pet root will destroy the fear 
        and make it harder for you to kill the mob. a very good pet to use when 
        pet is one of the main tank.<br>
        Air: the best indoor pet when working your way through a dungeon cause 
        to its ability to invis and not draw attention to itself, also a good 
        pet when fighting casters because it will stun the caster.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Monk</font></u><br>
        Melee class with the Feign Death ability, preferred puller.&nbsp; They 
        deal an excellent amount of damage so should be in the front line to bring 
        the mobs down fast.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Necromancer</font></u><br>
        These guys are masters of death, they are very powerful if played properly. 
        They have strong pets and a range of spells that can help any group. They 
        can use direct damage, dots and can even give the healers or casters extra 
        mana if required. Same rules for the pets apply here as with the magicians, 
        except there is no choice of pets.&nbsp;<br>
        <font color="#FF6600"><br>
        <u> Paladin</u></font><br>
        Defensive tank. this basically means that they will be in the frontline 
        dealing damage. They do not do as much damage as the warriors but have 
        some magic abilities to make up for it.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        Paladin should be constantly taunting the enemy, not only with taunt but 
        also with stuns and flash of light (care should be taken with FOL at low 
        levels as it can cause the mob to run). in between battles they should 
        be 'top-up' healing his party to let the healers regain as much mana as 
        possible.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        paladin should also be ready to use his Lay On Hands ability to completely 
        heal one of his party if things go really badly. Experience will tell 
        you who to save, but its different in each situation. only use in emergencies.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Ranger</font></u><br>
        The ranger is a mix of druid and warrior. They are the masters of archery 
        and can cause a good deal of damage before the mob even get to you, they 
        are often used to pull the mobs because of this. like the paladin they 
        can melee very well although not as well as the warriors. Again the ranger 
        should me in the front line causing pain.<br>
        <font color="#FF6600"><br>
        <u> Rogue</u></font><br>
        Rogues are capable of dealing extraordinary amounts of damage with their 
        backstab. However the whole group needs to understand how to fight with 
        them. The Rogue should always be behind the mob and often needs to run 
        about to be there. The melee guys should make sure that they are positioned 
        in a way that makes it easy for the rogue to get behind the enemy.&nbsp; 
        The melees should constantly taunt to keep the mob off the rogue so that 
        he may do his work.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rogue 
        can also apply poisons to the mobs which can be a great help during the 
        battle.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 
        they have the ability to hide/sneak around they are often called on to 
        scout an area before entering or to perform corpse retrievals when things 
        go wrong.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Shadowknight</font></u><br>
        The anti paladin. they can deal excellent damage and also have some of 
        the necromancers spells to make the mobs short life even more unpleasant. 
        they should work in a similar way to paladins in attacking the mob and 
        using every trick in the book to keep the mob hitting them.&nbsp;</font> 
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
        also have the ability to summon a pet to help them, however its rare that 
        you find a Shadowknight that can keep his pet under control AND melee 
        effectively, its just too much to do at once. Not so much of a problem 
        in open areas but in tight dungeons a uncontrolled pet can be deadly.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Shaman</font></u><br>
        Can pose as main healer but their preferred role is secondary healer. 
        They also slow the mobs down, buff the melees and de-buff the enemy. they 
        have some powerful DOT spells at higher levels, and can give increases 
        to every player stat there is. in short a damn useful person to be in 
        the group.<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Warrior</font></u><br>
        The warriors job is simple. Hit the mobs and hit them hard. They should 
        constantly taunt the mobs to keep their attention. they can give out and 
        take massive amounts of damage.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <u> <font color="#FF6600">Wizard</font></u><br>
        No-one does higher magic based damage than these guys. they should cast 
        damage shields on the melee and nuke the mobs WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT!. 
        only experience will tell you the right time, but a good guide is when 
        the mob is just over half its health points. If the wizard or any other 
        caster agro the mob too early its a hard job for the melee guys to get 
        it off of you.<br>
        <br>
        <u>3) Group composition:</u></font> 
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Preferably 
        a group should have at least two melee classes and one (main) healer. 
        The remaining three spots<br>
        can be filled by:<br>
        one more melee class.<br>
        one enchanter<br>
        one secondary healer<br>
        one or two from wizard, necromancer, magician.<i><br>
        </i><br>
        These are not hard and fast. clever players will learn each others abilities 
        and create strategies to dealt with mobs no matter which classes are in 
        the group. The main thing to remember is that every class has something 
        to offer some combinations are very easy, others take a lot more work, 
        but never be afraid to experiment with new combinations and different 
        ways of tackling the enemy.</font>
