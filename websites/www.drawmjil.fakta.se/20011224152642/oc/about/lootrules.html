Check the drops and announce them.
</li><li>
Everyone who CAN and WILL use an item will roll within the rotation system.
</li><li>
The rotation system: Once you have won a roll on a type of equipment you loose your right to roll on that type untill all who CAN and WILL use that type of equipment have won such an item. There are three types of equipment: normal armor, chest pieces, and weapons. For example you win a piece of armor and next a weapon drops. In this case you are allowed to roll on the weapon drop, with a chance to win it.
</li><li>
Honour - Honour is letting someone else loot an item if it is a major upgrade for them while it would only be a minor upgrade for you. Honour is allowing someone to complete a set of armour. Honour is thinking twice before rolling against a guild-elder. If you are below level 55 please remember that the higher level players often make a raid possible or at least much easier. The guild is best served if the best drops go to the higher level players who need them.
</li></ul>

Those are the default rules. When organising a raid, a Warlord can set different rules as long as they are announced to all participants beforehand. So a raid can be organised to get a certain item for a certain person. But it is also possible for the Warlord of a Hate raid to announce beforehand that the first Aphotic Robe that drops goes to a certain magician for example. 
<BR><BR>
What follows is a clarification and expansion of the default rules:<BR>

All gems (or equivalent loot) that drop default to the guildbank. All spells that drop that no-one attending can use default to the guild bank. This includes spells that are too high to use. So if a level 60 magician spell would drop and there is no level 60 magician present, the spell goes to the guildbank. Even if there is a level 59 Magician present. Any officers present on the raid can represent the guildbank.
<BR><BR>
If you were not on "the break" of the current raid or you join a raid at a much later stage.
Please think twice before rolling against someone who was there from the beginning. Remember that 
the people who were there at the start of the raid put in more time and effort than you.
<BR><BR>
If you win an item on a raid and it replaces the old item you had, you are more or less expected to pass the old item down to a fellow guild-member. More specific rules regarding this can be found in the <A HREF="./initiate/loot.html">guild loot rules</A>.
