            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well... 
            just my input in setting up multigroup raids:<br>
            <br>
            You should try to balance the groups out. I would suggest getting 
            them about even, that is at least one tank, one healer and one nuker 
            I each. The rest can be filled out evenly. Be sure to put a healer 
            in the same group as the enchanter, which till get beaten on, and 
            will probably need a heal fast when that happens.<br>
            <br>
            Ok, now that my opinion is stated, I try to explain why.<br>
            <br>
            The tanks need to see the HP on the casters to see if one of them 
            is falling rapidly and then switch target to try to taunt. This is 
            not true if you have a chanter in the raid, in which case the cleric 
            should just try to keep the chanter alive, the tanks continue to take 
            mobs out, while the enchanter chain-stun the mob he have on him/her 
            and then trying to mezz them. In this scenario the cleric can also 
            try to help with root to give the enchanter a break and get that mezz 
            through.<br>
            <br>
            If you only have one cleric, put him in the same group as the highest 
            level melee, that is due to the fact that the melee will probably 
            take the most damage since he will have the highest taunt skill. On 
            'lower' levels, a Druid, shaman or similar will work nice enough as 
            a secondary healer for the other group.<br>
            <br>
            So, when it comes to putting groups together, try to even them out 
            when it comes to nuking, healing, level and tanking, that will also 
            be most fair considering XP gained, and will, therefore, make the 
            casters less eager to nuke.<br>
            <br>
            Now, concerning nuking, that is not a bad thing, just be sure that 
            the agro has 'STUCK' to the tank before you start, like about mob 
            is on 70 percent health. Now the TRICK: DON'T CHAIN NUKE, you CAN 
            nuke when mob is still at 70% health. But DON'T nuke directly again, 
            wait about 20 secs before you nuke again. The mob 'calculates' damages 
            done over a certain period of time, and how often that damage was 
            done. That is why fast low damage weapons are preferred over slow 
            high damage weapons for tanks. So ONE big nuke, the mob can handle, 
            but several, no, you will get agroed. Same here with DOT's, those 
            can really piss a mob off. I know... I think I am a fairly good tank, 
            doing nice and quick damage at level 47, but still, when Annanas gets 
            one of her level 49 DOT's in to early, the mob WILL go CRAZY on her.<br>
            <br>
            And, a small tip to you enchanters out there: If you CAN, please don't 
            nuke the mob, I know it is great fun (Cataplas), but you have the 
            biggest taunt-nukes around (for some reason), and it is a pain in 
            the ass to get the mobs of you, me and Sicarius chased Cataplas and 
            the Lavacrawlers around the stonespider room for several hours yesterday 
            when Cataplas decided he had to much Mana and went into Wizard mode 
            ;-)<br>
            <br>
            Thing is, be sure to keep the enchanter alive, if he/she dies you 
            are all dead, at least on higher levels. Another thing on higher levels, 
            you are not afraid to die anymore, since you hopefully have a cleric 
            there to give you a decent ress. I always stay behind, pressing that 
            hotkey with 'ZONE!' on, working hard to get the mobs attention so 
            that the rest of the group can gate out. They will come back and ress 
            me... there is all a matter of trust.<br>
            <br>
            You are VERY right about the monk part. Don't know if you heard about 
            MONK FD pulling and tagging?<br>
            <br>
            The monk pulls. He is the puller. He know probably when he have gotten 
            a pull to big for the party to handle. He takes the mobs to a fairly 
            big spot, knows as the FD-spot. The TANK (The assister or also known 
            as the tagger) stand a bit back, out of aggrorange, but still where 
            he can se the monk.<br>
            <br>
            The monk the FD. The tank (who everyone is supposed to assist) stand 
            ready with bow on the string watching. When the mobs then start to 
            go back, the tank picks out the one furthest back and puts an arrow 
            into it. Hopefully a lot of the mobs will still be wondering away 
            top their original spawn spot. The tank then shouts INCOMING and head 
            back to the group, if he have more than one mob, well, there is always 
            the enchanter.<br>
            <br>
            This could be done to an even greater extent with to FDer whereas 
            one FD, the other one TAG, if the tag goes bad, he FD's to, and then 
            the TANK can do the final pull... takes a while to practice... but 
            are used much at higher levels, where monks are THE preferred pullers....<br>
            <br>
            And, MIDGAARD, so RIGHT you are, makes my eye water with Ogre tears 
            ;-)<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            and, for those of you having trouble targeting someone and assisting? 
            Well, press PF10, go into socials, pick a key that you don't use (should 
            be all over them ;-). Right click on the header and rename that to 
            'assist' the right click on one of the rows bellow and type '/assist 
            Drawmjils' (without the quotes) if it is Drawmjil who is targeter. 
            Then move that social to the hotkey bank. BANG, all you have to do 
            now is to press that hotkey until you get a target, and the just keep 
            killing until the mob is dead. Very easy....<br>
            <br>
            Stay safe!<br>

          <hr>
          <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">I 
          for one is very impressed with the seriousness you apply in this! I 
          think I was in the 40:ies with my first char when I first attended a 
          larger organized raid!<br>
          <br>
          First; Organizing raids is a LOT more work than what it seems to the 
          casual participant. You often have to wait for long periods of time.. 
          It is boring, and people don't seem to do anything - Rest assured that 
          the warlord is in Tell Hell, getting people together and getting them 
          to understand what is about to be attempted. This is especially true 
          when the nice snug two-unit commando raid you were trying to establish, 
          develops into a 7-group social event for the whole guild *shudder*<br>
          <br>
          Base setup<br>
          ----------------<br>
          There are as many ideas for this as there are guilds.. I know some large 
          guilds (NA) insists on having pure melee groups and pure healer groups 
          when doing dragons and larger stuff.<br>
          <br>
          Harmonium, GC and RA use a setup that is almost always based on two 
          really good balanced groups. Be it dragons, planes or whatever (save 
          Trak and Venril which is special).<br>
          As long as you have these two groups which you have very good control 
          over, you can fill in with additional caster groups or whatever just 
          to bolster. These groups are controlled and fairly self sufficient.. 
          Others will follow their lead.. (I kind of agree with the latter after 
          having been on both. Asking 3 different healers for a heal, and finally 
          getting a 300hp GH when I'm a tank with 3.5k hp on a naggy raid is pretty 
          frustrating)<br>
          <br>
          Other things I've worked out..<br>
          ------------------------------<br>
          Have a goal!<br>
          <br>
          Make sure everyone on the raid knows about this goal..<br>
          <br>
          Do research! Find out as much of the goal as possible, and the way to 
          get there. Have an idea of how to solve possible problems.<br>
          <br>
          Make sure everyone on the raid knows about how the goal will be reached. 
          If not from the start, at least before you start each major endeavor.<br>
          <br>
          In fact.. Information to the participants is one of the most important 
          things with warlording - and very hard to handle yourself when you constantly 
          get 60 tells a min or so.. Assign someone to continuously pump information 
          to the participants.. If you can sit in the same room and don't have 
          to chat, that will help..<br>
          <br>
          When doing raids peoples IQ tend to plummet.. As a raid leader you have 
          to be aware of this! Lots of people find it very confusing trying to 
          do things together in a group, and a raid is even worse (Not to mention 
          how it the warlord feels)<br>
          <br>
          So.. forget these are your friends. Put your natzie gear on - Now you 
          are dealing with idiots!<br>
          <br>
          Explain everything several times.. preferably five or so - you can still 
          be sure there are several who didn't get the message.<br>
          <br>
          Use CAPITAL letters for important stuff.. Be straight with what you 
          want and don't be afraid to tell someone to stop something, but don't 
          get mad either.<br>
          <br>
          Never ask a general question like &quot;Can someone please get XXXXX 
          at zone? He don't know the way..&quot;! Because a number of people will 
          simultaneously get the impulse to do this thing and be useful, rush 
          to zone totally unknowing of the others, some perhaps dying on the way, 
          not to mention training the party resulting in a big massive CR before 
          the raid even started..<br>
          Instead ask someone suitable on tell if he can help (Better yet; Tell 
          him to).. then inform the others about him getting XXXXX at zone!<br>
          <br>
          Patience is probably THE most important virtue in leading raids!<br>
          <br>
          Oh.. And do the thinking for the instrumental classes.. Take wizards 
          necessary for getting to hate; Unless told otherwise, you can safely 
          bet on the porting wizzie to have all the eight 250pp stones the teleport 
          spell requires as component, on his body the first time he ports up 
          a group and promptly gets whacked as he zone in to hate *smiles at Falloz*<br>
          <br>
          Heh.. There is so much to this.. Most should be obvious - except it 
          wasn't to me and, ohhh did I suffer! Still.. there is something special 
          to arranging something, and succeeding.. The smiles on peoples faces 
          when the get nice stuff they've fought for.. - Besides.. The guild relies 
          on people doing this; Taking initiative and making things happen. Even 
          the lowliest and newest member should be helped if he/she attempts to 
          arrange something for the rest of the guild (Unless it's an all greed 
          situation, where everyone is going to spend umpteen hours helping him 
          to a new thingie)<br>
          <br>
          Hmm.. this is perhaps the most important of all: Too much people just 
          sit around waiting for something to happen, perhaps even whining about 
          it.. Then they tag along and whine about it being boring when things 
          don't seem to happen rapidly, and then they whine big-time when anything 
          goes wrong, warlord makes a wrong decision etc.. Not to mention too 
          many people have opinions about what should be done, and how.. when 
          they're not doing it! Not only does some people have to take initiative 
          and lead.. People will have to want to be lead! So shut up and do what 
          the warlord says without a lot of whining and complaining, not to mention 
          helpful suggestions (Unless something is really really wrong)<br>
          <br>
          Yeah, yeah.. I know.. another novel<br>
          To be honest, I'm a noob at this.. Just trying to sort things out myself!<br>
