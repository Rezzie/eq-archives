Grouping is the thing in Everquest. Always try and group with the guild ! Always ! If no group is available, try to make one.
<BR><BR>
If you are moving into a new place, check with guildies that some move with you. For example post on the boards asking if anyone want to camp Guk, Sol B, Karnor Castle, etc.
<BR><BR>
When in a group, always try and foresee when people are leaving and ask in guildsay, that in 15 min. you have an opening for a healer, tank, nuker, etc. in Lower Guk, Frenzy.
<BR><BR>
Loot may have been the reason for most disputes on Norath. In Old Continent we do not want to be known as ninjalooters, lootwhores or similar. Be fair and have a general rule that those that CAN and WILL use will roll on an item.
<BR><BR>
If you enter a group where the object is to gain wealth, be sure you agree upon the rules before entering the group or having new members on board. Meaning if you enter a group at the Archmagi in lower guk and you want to roll on the Shining Metallic Robe, even though you are a warrior: say so before!
<BR><BR>
In OC a guildcamp might have had the purpose to get Ipren out of his newbie robe, please notice the difference.
