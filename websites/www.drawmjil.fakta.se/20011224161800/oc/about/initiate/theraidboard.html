<A HREF="http://pub7.ezboard.com/foldcontinentraids">The raid board</A> is where we announce our raids. Or at least the raids that are not a big secret.
<BR><BR>
Anyone in Old Continent can organise a raid. This does not mean you have to warlord the raid you are organising. You can ask someone else to be the warlord. However before you announce the raid you have to have a warlord. And that is just one of the many things you need. You also need a bare minimum of required classes.
<BR><BR>
For example you want to make a hate raid you will need 2 enchanters, 2 clerics, 2 wizards (and the stones they need) and maybe a monk puller at the very least. The recruiting can be done in the member chat forum but it is much better to send tells in-game to the people you think you need. If you have never organised a raid before it might also be a smart idea to talk it through with an officer first.
<BR><BR>
After you have gathered enough support for the raid you are ready to make a post on the raid board. You should do this preferably a week in advance but at the very least four days in advance.
<BR><BR>
The topic must contain: Place - date - time<BR>
The body must contain: Gathering place, warlord(s), goal of the raid and optionally raid specific loot rules, whether the raid is <A HREF="openclosed.html">open or closed</A> and links to maps and tactics.
<BR><BR>
If you want to raid some place but do want to organise it you can always discuss it with an officer and we will see what we can do for you.
