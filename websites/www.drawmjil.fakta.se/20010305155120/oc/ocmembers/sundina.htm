        Story of my life: I was born in a small village outside of Felwithe called feinue, witch is no longer. My childhood started out good i was a quick learner and loved to be out in the forest of Greater Faydark to play with my friends. But one day i cant remember the date, when i was 3 years old the village was attacked by a hord of Orcs, this orcs claimed that they where the ruler of the continent and that we Elfs where a minor race that has to be exterminated. They killed everyone in the village except for me and my sister.<br>
        We got separated during the slaughter of the Feinue I dont know what happened to her until manu years later. I was lucky to get away, much due to the fact that i knew the forest very well., but while i was running i got knocked when i fell down a whole in the ground. i woke up i dont know how much later, in the bed and above me stood 2 strange men in strange robes talking in a languages that sounded very old.<br>
          <br>
        The 2 men standing above me was called Master Cendrix Summenion, and  Kalladere. They sais that they had taken me to the Magician guild in Felwithe and that i was safe here.<br>
        I asked them what had happened to my parrents and to my friends, but they didnt want to answer me, I now think it was cause I was so young and they didnt want to make me sad again.<br>
          <br>
        at the age of 4 was i taken to a big room in the guild building where there sat 20 Magicians all in the same Red robe whit the yellow and blue stripes on.<br>
        and in the middle of the Circle was a ring with a a 6 star in it.<br>
        They told me to stand in the middle and then they all started to mess on this old languages, The room got all lit up in different colours, this is the last i remember of the room, i woke up much later in my bed again.<br>
        And Cendrix stood beside my bed.<br>
        He told me that what had happened in the room was the test of the Elementals and that they had tested to see if i was capable and had the powers to become a true Magician.<br>
          <br>
        2 days later was i called back to the room and the same Group of magicians sat there all quiet.<br>
        I once again was told to stand in the middle in the circle, but this time didnt they start to mezz, but instead  a new Man entered the room, he looked very old and wize. He didnt walk but instead he floated and i could see that on his left ring finger did he wear a red ring that had a stone that was glowing in all different colours of the rainbow.<br>
        When i was only one meter away from me he stoped and started to speak, even tho he spoke in this same old languages was it like i understood what he said<br>
        He said "- Greetings young Sundina, You have proven Worthy to be tought the ways of the Elements, and you will become an apprantasies here at the academy"<br>
          <br>
        I got down to my knees infront of The master and bend my head in front of him as he gave me my robe the green of an apprentesies.<br>
        He then just dissapeared in front of me and my Teacher and master Cendrix then steped forward and asked me to follow him.<br>
          <br>
        The following years that went by didnt I do anything else but studied and practised to learn how to use and control the powers that lays within my mind., Then one day when i was around the age of 15 or 16 can not realy remember, well anyway that day Cendrix walked in to my room telling me that my time at the guild was over and to learn how to become a real magician, I had to go outside the guild and travel the world of Norath, and use my powers to help and to serve those who where in need. He said that this was the only way i ever can become a real elementarist and a true manipulator of the 4 elements.<br>
          <br>
        He told me that i had to pack my bags this evening and leave early in the morning, to face the world and to use what i have been tought. This evening i had my dinner in my room alone to think over what he had said and not to show that I was a little sad that i have to leave this wonderfull place.<br>
        I had over the years that i had been here grown pretty found of this place.<br>
