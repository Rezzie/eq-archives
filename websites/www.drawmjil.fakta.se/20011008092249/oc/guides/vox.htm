        <font size="2"><b>Ganking VOX the Rhasru way</b></font>
        <p><font size="2">Well
        actually there is not one trick its a combination of things that will
        make her go down. It requires for everyone to play at their best.<br>
        <br>
        <b><i>TRICK 1:</i></b> Please get your sv vs Cold as high as possible.
        Lady Vox can only hit one person at a time, she can only smite (the
        heavy version) one person at a time but what she kills most people with
        is her AOE cold spell. So if your save versus cold is very low you will
        only suck mana from the clerics and die very fast anyway. Personally I
        would exchange my 6ac 66hp rings (if I had those) for 5 save versus Cold
        rings that is how important I think save versus Cold is.<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>TRICK 2:</b></i> Walk towards Vox do not run. If you are walking
        and get feared you (hopefully) wont run all the way to the pits.<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>TRICK 3:</b></i> Turn off all display options you dont need. This
        (supposedly) helps against people going linkdead. If your packetloss
        gets high use Sit-Stand to try and keep connection with the server.<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>TRICK 4:</b></i> Melee classes HAVE to stay alive. Everyone taunts
        and bashes but as soon as you see Vox hitting you. (not one hit but
        repeatedly) YOU STOP ATTACKING HER. As soon as she stops hitting you you
        check your health. If it is below 60% you run back to get healed. Melee
        classes should look at it this way: YOUR JOB IS NOT TO KILL VOX BUT TO
        RUN THE CLERICS OUT OF MANA. If the raid fails while the clerics still
        had mana the melee classes sucked bigtime. If the raid failed because
        the clerics where out of mana ... erm ... oki ... then I am to blame.<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>TRICK 5:</b></i> You never ever run to the clerics while Vox is
        hitting you. Never ever ! I will repeat this: You never ever run to the
        clerics while Vox is hitting you. It is important Vox does NOT get near
        the exit or near the walls.<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>TRICK 6:</b></i> Some groups will have a druid or shaman in it. In
        the beginning of the battle they should try chain casting their heals on
        different group members. When Vox reaches half health switch to
        nuke-mode.<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>Trick 7:</b></i> Chanters x4<br>
        <br>
        They must ToT Vox constantly that is there only jo forget Clarity just
        ToT there is nopthing more annoying than haveing get vox to 10% health
        and for her to CH herself.<br>
        If you don't ToT her you will fail every time no matter what<br>
        <br>
        <i><b>TRICK 8:</b></i> Well actually I ran out of tricks but I wanted to
        add two more things: Enchanters start Mana Sieving when Vox gets below
        80% health. And the Nuke-division start casting heavily when she hits
        50% health.<br>
        <br>
        Well that ends my tricks to beat Vox. If anyone has anymore tips please
        post them here. I will make a few hotkeys to broadcast these infobits
        while we are in Permafrost. If you have read these tricks please feel
        free to repeat them Ad Infinitum in group tell while we are preparing to
        take her down.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Buffing Process:</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In most raids the buffing is pretty
        disorganised and takes far too long. I always hope to do things a little
        better than other people so I am going to explain what the buffing will
        be like prior to we attack Vox.<br>
        <br>
        First druids gather at the rock, shaman gather at the ramp next to it,
        clerics gather at the ramp opposite of it, enchanters gather near the
        door.<br>
        <br>
        Now *I* will make groups of 5 melee people (melee being: warriors,
        monks, rogues, paladins, shadowknights, rangers).<br>
        <br>
        Group leader starts by finding a druid. (that shouldnt be too hard since
        they all standing near the rock). Invites that druid into the group. The
        druid then dispells anyone who still has any buffs on from slaying the
        Ice Giants. Then the druid gives 4 crap buffs, for example:<br>
        see invisibility<br>
        endure disease<br>
        endure poison<br>
        endure fire<br>
        <br>
        When every group member has those four buffs. The group leader kicks the
        druid. And invites a shaman. The shaman will buff every member of the
        group with the following spells:<br>
        tumultuous strength<br>
        agility or deliriously nimble<br>
        stamina or riotous health<br>
        Talisman of Altuna<br>
        <br>
        After the shaman the group leader invites a cleric. The cleric again
        buffs the entire group with the following spells:<br>
        Armour of Faith (shield of words too expensive for 6 extra ac IMO)<br>
        Resolution or Heroic Bond<br>
        Symbol of Naltron<br>
        <br>
        After the cleric you get an enchanter to buff the group with the
        following:<br>
        group resist magic<br>
        swift like the wind<br>
        <br>
        And finally u get back to a druid who will give the group:<br>
        circle of summer or resist cold<br>
        <br>
        Once u receive your final buff you log out immediatly and go to the
        Xev-Vox chat channel (if there isnt such a channel please make one, if u
        dont know how to make a chat channel wait for someone who does (it is in
        the help btw)).<br>
        <br>
        I will make hotkeys beforehand to explain this buffing process while we
        are in permafrost because I know lots of our members do not read this
        board.<br>
        <br>
        If you have any comments please post them here, but I'll also assume you
        have read this post so I might make you a group leader <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->
