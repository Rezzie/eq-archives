First of all there are the <A HREF="apprules.html">rules</A> as posted above the application forum. Please familiarise yourself with them.<BR><BR>

After you have posted your application on the application board do not expect to get many votes right away unless you have really good friends in the guild who are full members. 

Gathering votes is a lengthy process at best where the initiative completely lies with the applicant. So you are going to have to put some work in if you really want to join our guild.<BR><BR>
The worst way you can go about it is to ask people to vote for you. The best way you can go about this is to seek <A HREF="http://www.drawmjil.fakta.se/members.asp">us</A> out so you can group and raid with us. As far as we are concerned actions speak much louder than words.

If you want to join a raid, you can read the <A HREF="http://pub7.ezboard.com/foldcontinentraids">raid board</A> and see if we have any plans. Please leave a message there if want to join a certain raid. Two things you should know about &#60;Old Continent&#62; before joining a raid, those are the <A HREF="raidrules.html">general raid rules</A> and the <A HREF="lootrules.html">raid loot rules</A>.
Another thing you must be aware of, is our stance on <A HREF="accsharing.html">account sharing</A>
<BR><BR>
Please keep in mind that &#60;Old Continent&#62; is primarily a European guild. Most of our raids are planned around 20.00 CET on weekdays and 14.00 CET in weekends. If that does not fit your playing hours we are probably not the right guild for you.
<BR><BR>
There are two ways players from &#60;Continental Drift&#62; can graduate to &#60;Old Continent&#62.<BR>
1) By recommendation of three officers from &#60;Continental Drift&#62;.<BR>
2) By following the regular application procedure for all applicants.<BR>
The first method is preffered, if this fails however the CD member can opt for the 2nd method.
<BR><BR>
If some parts of this guide are not clear to you or you disagree with some parts, please feel free to contact an officer in-game, we are nearly always available to discuss matters with you.
