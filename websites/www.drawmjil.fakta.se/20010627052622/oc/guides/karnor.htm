          <font face="Arial" size="2">I have drawn up some dodgy maps of the
          zone until someone does some better ones. And no, adding some fancy
          textures to my maps and putting your name on it does not constitute a
          better map ;-)</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The maps are not to scale and there are
          some small innacuracies I could not be bothered fixing but if you cant
          find your way around with these a better map is not what you need ;-)</font>
          <h2><font face="Arial" size="2">Tourist Stops</font></h2>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">This section covers the major areas of the
          zone.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">1: Zone</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">The zone can accomodate two camp spots at
          the left (marked 1L) and right zone (marked 1R). They are nice camp
          spots due to proximity of zone but bad due to proximity of zone (i.e.
          trains ;-) Due to the dodgy aggro keep well back from the intersection
          while fighting or you may attract pulls from the other zone group. If
          there is only one group at the zone the intersection is a nice place
          to camp as the group can see incoming pulls but be prepared to move
          once another group sets up at the zone.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On some servers people have tried to
          set up one zoneline for incoming people/camping and the other zone for
          outgoing people/trains. While this sounds great in theory I doubt it
          will ever become common practice due to the current popularity of the
          zone.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">2: Moat Corners</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">From the zone move past the first two
          drolvarg spawns and turn left or right before crossing the bridge. The
          far corners are known as the left (marked 2L) and right (marked 2R)
          moat corner camps. They are good places to camp as they are out of the
          path of trains and less crowded than the zone. Be aware when camping
          here that if you stand or fight near the moat edge you can aggro mobs
          in the moat. This can be avoided by pulling to the appropriate place
          and placing the tanks appropriately.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I perfer the left moat corner. It
          provides a larger surface area which is useful if parking becomes
          necessary. The right corner is much more cramped and has a
          &quot;hole&quot; in the path to it requiring some acrobatics to
          negotiate it.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From these camps you will have access
          to the numerous moat wanderers as well as normal pulling from the
          castles.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">3: Captain Area</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">Across the first bridge is the Captain
          area, named for the Drolvarg Captain who occasionaly spawns on the
          second level. It lies in the centre of the moat. A second bridge goes
          from the captain area into the main castle. At the ground floor are
          four static drolvargs. Up the stairs is the Captain area proper. This
          area contains six static drolvargs, four at the front and two at the
          back. It also contains 4 wandering drolvargs. For pullers passing
          under this area remember that one of the captain area wanderers walks
          right across the bottom area. The other three always stay up top. Any
          of these 10 drolvargs can occasionaly spawn as the Drolvarg Captain.
          The spawns on the front ramparts are paired and two will come if you
          aggro one (Unless the puller is 54+, see Aggro Reduction below).</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many people choose to camp the captain
          area from the small room at the top of the stairs. This is not a good
          camp place due to the dodgy aggro of the mobs. If someone pulls some
          mobs through the ground floor of the captain area there is a good
          chance these mobs may aggro on your group at the top of the stairs.
          Also if the your puller is passing across the bridge on the second
          level he will definately aggro on mobs being pulled underneath. If you
          still want to camp up here I would recommend moving to the room
          directly opposite the stair room. Also ensure your puller does not use
          the bridge.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is possible to pull the entire
          captain area (not all in one go hopefully) to a zone or moat corner
          camp. This may be preferable to camping up there and suffering
          possible trains. The only problem with doing this is that unless you
          are camped up there it seems to be open season. As soon as the captain
          spawns you will find 4 pullers scrabbling to get it ;-) A polite
          /shout to the zone saying you are pulling the captain area may either
          get people to leave spawns up there for you or alert them to safe
          captain pulls when he pops ;-)</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">4: Left Courtyard/Well Courtyard Area</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">If you run across both bridges you enter
          the main castle. Just over the second bridge is a T intersection. Go
          left into the left courtyard. Immediately upon entering move to the
          middle of the left wall. This seems to be the best place to camp in
          this courtyard. Other places seems to pull trains down from the above
          walkways. If you are camping in this area a better place is the well
          courtyard. From the above mentioned camp move through the arch
          opposite into a smaller courtyard with a well in the middle. To the
          left is a spot with two spawns. This is the camp spot. The well is
          slightly better as there are no wanderers pathing directly through
          your camp.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">5: Right Courtyard</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">While I have camped here once it does not
          seem like a great place to camp. Immediately upon entering look to the
          left and you will see a statue. Have the group camp at this spot. Only
          the puller should move from this spot. The reason is that this place
          is often camped for the Undead Jailor. From the camp move over to the
          far right corner. Stand/sit in this corner and you will aggro the
          Undead Jailor room below. This usually consists of two skeletons, a
          hand and the Undead Jailor/placeholder. Also from this camp you can
          pull the 5 rooms through the door on the left. I have not pulled these
          much but they contain quite a few mobs including a spawn point for the
          Skeletal Scryer and Spectral Knight. It is possible these rooms would
          provide a more secure camp spot than the courtyard but have not tried
          it myself. If you are pulling these rooms do it carefully. On the
          ground floor you will aggro the mobs in the two rooms above you.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">6: Council Chamber</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">In the center of the main castle is a
          large room as tall as three levels. Around the outer walls of level 2
          and 3 (marked 6b and 6c respectively) are ledges from which you can
          look down onto floor of the chamber (marked 6a).</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In this area you can find Skeletal
          Protectors among other things. I have not explored all of the small
          siderooms in this area.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">7: Venril Sethir</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">At the bottom far end of the council
          chamber are some passages leading to the chambers of Venril Sethir. He
          is guarded by six mobs and is pretty rough, apparently slightly
          tougher than phinegal from Kedge Keep. I have not fought him at all,
          nor approached this area.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">8: Skeletal Towers</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">From the left courtyard go up the stairs.
          You will come to a T intersection. Just to the right is an open area
          with a single static skeleton spawn (Lookout/Watcher). This is the
          first skeletal tower (Tower1, Marked 8). Go left and you will find
          three more skeletal towers (Tower2, Tower3 and Tower4). The first
          three towers have a single static skeleton spawn while Tower4 has a
          skeleton spawn and in the room below two more mobs that aggro as well
          (Usually a hand and decayed skeleton). The walkways in this area
          contain quite a few wanderers (at least 4). If you are camping this
          area I would recommend setting up camp on Tower2. While Tower1 can be
          camped it has many more mobs wandering through and is not as secure as
          Tower2. The Skeletal Captain spawns in this area although I have only
          ever seen him spawn on Tower4 and Tower3.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When fighting in this area make sure
          you do not push the mobs of the edge. They usually return with a few
          more mobs. Also dont fall of the edge yourself which could be
          embarrasing ;-)</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">9: Hand</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">From Tower2 head towards Tower1 and keep
          going straight on. You will pass a door on the right, ignore this. You
          will pass a passage on the right, ignore this. Eventually the path
          turns right. Just on your left is a short door. You can look over the
          door (unless you are a shorty) into the Hand room. This room contains
          4 spawns, typically cursed hands or constructs. Rarely the Construct
          of Sethir will spawn in this room. Once the room is broken it makes a
          nice camp spot as it is reasonably large and out of the path of
          wanderers.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note that you do not aggro the hand
          room from the corridor outside. You can even pull mobs past the hand
          room without aggroing them. This is nice if you want to pull the
          jail/warlord areas without having to worry about the hand room.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">10: Jail</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">Instead of entering the hand room pass it
          with the door on your left. You will reach a T intersection. Go left
          then right. To your right you will see an archway. Look in there and
          you will see 5 doors. Each is the door to a cell and there are 4 aggro
          mobs in here. The second door to the right contains the Human
          Skeleton. It cons indifferent to most/all people and is part of a
          wizard quest.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Be careful of the aggro in this area.
          You will aggro at least 2 jail mobs through the walls as you reach the
          T intersection described above. After that move slowly towards the
          jail and you will be able to aggro the remaining two mobs seperately
          if desired.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rarely in one of the jail cells will
          spawn a Skeletal Warlord.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">11: Drolvarg Warlord</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">From the jail move past the five doors to
          a set of stairs at the end. Go down the stairs and open the door.
          Inside is a small room containing 4 spawn points. This is the Drolvarg
          Warlord room. Typically it will contain Drolvarg Bodyguards. Any of
          these spawns can occasionaly be a Drolvarg Warlord. Like frenzied
          ghouls it is possible to have multiple Warlords spawned at once. Also
          in this room can spawn a Wulfewere Bodyguard and a Drolvarg Pawduster.
          All these mobs (except maybe the Pawduster) are 50+ with the Warlord
          being 53 or so.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If your goal is to camp this area there
          are two possible ways to break it. A monk can FD split the area fairly
          easily. Set up camp at Tower2/Tower1 and have the monk clear the jail.
          The monk will then aggro the Warlord room and run up and feign near
          the door to the hand. They can be chain pulled in the normal fashion.
          Be aware of the teleportation pathing described below. This will
          happen here. The monk will aggro the room and run just past the hand
          room. Stand there until one or more of the mobs teleports on top of
          you before feigning. Once the room is broken you can move into the
          room and camp there. I have not camped in the room, only pulled it to
          the skeletal towers so do not know of any problems with camping in
          there but it should be fine.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have no monk you will just have
          to rush the room. I have heard that six people level 48-52 can rush
          the room and survive. It will be a very tough fight though.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Basement</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">There are at least three ways to get into
          the basement.</font>
          <p>&nbsp;
          <ol>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Moat Tunnel:</b> Stand at the
              right zone and follow the right wall until you come to the back
              wall of the zone. Left is a narrow channel of the moat which
              seperates you from the main castle. In the moat is an underwater
              tunnel which leads into the basement. The moat wanderers come from
              here and do laps of the moat.<br>
              </font>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Well:</b> Leap into the well for

            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Upper Stairs:</b> From Tower1
              head towards the hand room. You will pass a door on your right,
              then a passage on your right. Look down the passage and you will
              see stairs going down. These stairs take you down into the
              basement.</font></li>
          </ol>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have not been far into the basement
          and cannot make any comments on possible camp places or mobs you will
          encounter. Going down the stairs is probably the best method for
          gaining access.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I will draw up a map of this area when
          I have explored it a bit more.</font>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">Not an actual area but some pointers on
          camping the Skeletal Warlord.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Skeletal Warlord spawns in at least
          three places which makes him hard to camp. The places I have seen him

            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Bridge 2:</b> Crossing the second

          <font face="Arial" size="2">The Well Courtyard is probably the best
          place to camp if you are specifically after the Skeletal Warlord. From
          here you can pull the seven mobs from the well rooms. Then you can go
          through those rooms, up the stairs and pull the jail area. You can
          potentially get the bridge warlord but that is usually pulled fairly
          quickly by the zone groups which makes it hard to camp.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is possible that the Skeletal
          Warlord can spawn in any point where a skeleton can spawn. I have
          never seen him in any place other than those mentioned above, and have
          seen him many times in each of the above places.</font>
          <h2><font face="Arial" size="2">Misc Issues</font></h2>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">Random, potentially useful things to know
          about the zone.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Bridge Aggro</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">If you stand on one of the two bridges you
          will eventually aggro a mob swimming in the moat below you. This is
          often the cause of unexpected trains as you run deep into the castle,
          unknowingly aggroing a moat mob, pull something and aggro another moat
          mob on the way back. You can either be aware of the problem and look
          before you cross the bridge or just think about all the extra exp you
          will get ;-)</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Pathing</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">The pathing is slightly dodgy in a few
          places. If you aggro a moat mob on the second bridge it will swim all
          the way to the right moat corner, get on land and run across the first
          bridge after you. Pulling mobs from the moat can sometimes cause
          problems because of the paths they take to get out of the moat. If you
          pull a mob from in the main castle and run through captain area the
          mob will come after you to the first bridge. It then does a little
          backtrack towards the second bridge before turning back to come after
          you again. Dont be fooled and run after it when it turns back ;-)</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Teleportation Pathing</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">In some places the mobs just cant be
          bothered walking. If you get too far from them they may get lazy and
          teleport to your location. There are at least two places where this
          will happen:</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) Drolvarg Captain Area: This can be
          used to your advantage. Run up into the captain area, grab a mob and
          leap of either the second level bridge or the ramparts. Run across the
          bridge and stand on the other side. The mob will eventually teleport
          to you. This is nice as it avoids the chance of the mob aggroing the
          moat as it passes across the bridge. It can cause problems if there
          are a lot of mobs up top and they get aggroed in the process.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) Warlord Area: If you pull the
          warlord area you can lose them through the jail. Wait just past the
          hand room and eventually some will teleport to you. If you are lucky
          just one of the mobs will teleport to your location making for an easy
          chain pull.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Proximity Aggro</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">The mobs are lazy. If they chase a puller
          past another player they will stop running after the original puller
          to beat on the newcomer who is much closer to them. Please be aware of
          this problem if you are the puller. If some one is pulling out of the
          castle move out of the way till they have passed or you will get
          trained. If you are pulling keep an eye on your pull. If it stops
          following go after it and reaggro. Monks make great pullers here as
          they can FD out of the way of another persons pull rather then having
          to possibly retreat all the way out.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Lazy Hate List:</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">Like the rest of Kunark if you aggro a
          monster and move a certain distance from it it decides you are not
          worth the effort and stops chasing you. You are NOT removed from the
          hate list. If you then move back inside the &quot;Hey, that guy is
          back and I am gonna kill him&quot; radius it will reaggro probably
          bringing a huge train. While this feature can sometimes be used to
          escape a nasty pull make sure you know when you are still aggroed.
          Rezone if so or bad things may happen.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Named Mobs:</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">There are several named mobs that spawn in
          random locations. Sentry of Sethir and Caller of Sethir both can spawn
          as wanderers over the second bridge, usually in the left/right
          courtyards. Skeletal Scryers are usually found in the moat but there
          is also one in the rooms of the right courtyard. Skeletal Berserkers
          also spawn in the main castle courtyards. The only place I recall
          seeing Beserkers spawn is in the two spawn point in the Well
          Courtyard.</font>
          <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Aggro Reduction:</font></h3>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">As a character gains levels aggro radius
          of mobs reduces greatly. In Karnors the magic level seems to be 54. At
          level 54 I can aggro once of the two entrance spawns and the second
          spawn will not chain aggro. I can even pull mobs past a single
          entrance spawn without aggroing it. This works for all Drolvarg
          sentries at least. This makes pulling much easier, especialy if you
          are pulling deeper as you can just ignore some of the earlier mobs.</font>
