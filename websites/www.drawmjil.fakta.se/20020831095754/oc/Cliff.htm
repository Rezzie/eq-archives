      SO you guys all think that is silly. Well, then hear my little story. I am 
      still ashamed and not worth to have 1 INT.<br>
      <br>
      Fellow OC members and myself were in SolB hunting fire giants. I was only 
      wiz and nuked very well, result was soon OOM and I needed to sit on my 
      dusty bottom to med. When I suddenly noticed Xobtik ( in wolf form ) 
      stupidly running up and down next to me. Magic word &quot;CLARITY&quot;, my eyes 
      became big.<br>
      He wasnt in my group, thats why I said: &quot;/say Xobtik can I get Clarity, 
      please?&quot;. Next pull, LOM and no clarity for me. He kept on running up and 
      down in small circles by the wall. After a while I said again: &quot;/say 
      Xobtik, may I have clarity, PLEASE?&quot;. Nothing happened. /say Xobtik please 
      please please. Next Pull... Alll fight hard and some died, Salamien had to 
      do some rez. But, Xobtik still ran up and down next to me, where I sat. 
      /bonk Xobtik. /tell xobtik cant you hear me? He replied: &quot;Of course I hear 
      you.&quot; So I typed &quot;/say then Xobtik please may I have clarity?&quot; Nothing 
      happened.... /bonk xobtik /kick Xobtik /bonk xobtik. I said again &quot;/say 
      WTF Xob, can I have clarity now or what. I want to nuke and need 
      clarity!!!&quot;. Nothing happened again. I got really upset and did /tell 
      xobtik darn, can I have clarity now? and he replied in tell: &quot;Well, you 
      have to come to me and get it!&quot;. &quot;Wow, thats it! No I am gone&quot;, I thought. 
      I was so angry with Xobtik. He was running up and down next to me and not 
      helping the group nor gave clarity. And has the guts to tell me: &quot;Then 
      come and get it&quot;. I was ready to duell, I felt my hairs standing upright 
      in the neck. BUT.... Next pull distracted the situation, it was really a 
      bad pull.. Fire giants and LDCs... I am at 50m. <br>
      We all really fought for our life hard and most of us only had a few HPs 
      left. I even played tank. Wow, Salamien died .. But, what must I see? 
      Xobtik still at the wall, doing nothing, full HP and still running up and 
      down at the wall. It was so close that no one died and Sala could be still 
      alive. I walked back, really sad about the loss of Salamien and annoyed 
      with the rude Enchanter that let his friends die. I typed /say Xobtik last 
      try, can I please have Clarity. No answer.. /say Xobtik what is wrong with 
      you? I sat down, tried to calm down and typed /tell Xobtik you know, you 
      kinda killed Salamien. He could be still alive! Its your fault! He wrote 
      back : &quot;Why I didnt killed him&quot;. Thats enough, that R E A L L Y cant be. 
      This is not a type of person I ever wanna group up again and I told 
      Salamien what I experienced with Xobtik. But, he just answered: &quot;LOL&quot;. I 
      told him again, he doesnt understand what I mean and he replied &quot;ROFL&quot;. I 
      was confused... Third attempt to try to tell Salamien, that its all 
      Xobtiks fault, that he refused to give me clarity. And Sala just answered 
      with: 'Its a pet'..... <br>
      <br>
      DoH! <br>
      <br>
      NOOOOO! <br>
      <br>
      That cant be!!!<br>

      <br>
      We were doing some XPing in Howling Stones with the two very kind ladies
      Mordeshaa and Graycie in our group. And Ugabuga manages to ding to 54 so
      we all congratulate him. And I say in groupchat welcome to the rows of the
      MightyStrike warriors. And Uga gets really excited and goes like yes
      MightyStrike is really good ! Dont heal me !<br>
      <br>
      It was clear he wanted to berserk and hit his newly gained discipline to
      impress the ladies present with his power. It takes him a while to get his
      health down all the time saying . dont heal me . dont heal me .<br>
      <br>
      So finally he goes berserk and the anticipation becomes unbearable as he
      announces he is going to hit his discipline for the very first time.<br>
      <br>
      The ten seconds start. At first nothing happens . and then still nothing
      happens . in second 8 or so he manages ONE critical hit (33). And then the
      discipline dies.<br>
      <br>
      I almost rolled off my chair laughing . Thanks Ugabuga !<font size="2"><br>
