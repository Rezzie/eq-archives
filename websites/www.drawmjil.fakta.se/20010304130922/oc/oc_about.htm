          </font><font face="Arial" size="1"><br>
          The guildchat is our common line of communication when online. Here is
          how we can use it:<br>
          <br>
          * SOCIAL: Chat and joke, any normal socialing.<br>
          <br>
          * HELP: Request help for ports, pricechecks or resses for that matter.
          We are here to help each other. However do NOT see this as a service
          which you at any time can request and expect delivered.<br>
          <br>
          * IGNORE: You are of course allowed to turn off guildchat if you are
          in a place where you do not need disturbance. Expect people to do this
          on raids.<br>
          <br>
          * RAIDS: The guildsay may be &quot;burrowed&quot; by a majority of
          people on a raid where fast communication is needed. If so, please try
          and keep socialising and jokes low.<br>
          <br>
          * SILENCE: The guildleader or any officer can call &quot;Guildsay
          SILENCE&quot;. This basically means that information neccesary for us
          all to hear are being relayed and just for a short period we need not
          to be interrupted.<br>

          You are oblidged to read the boards. This is our primary means of
          communication! To do this, you must make an EZBoard account. For
          access to member protected areas, post your name on the General Boards
          and state that you want in. These boards are not password protected
          and our EZBoard administrators will let you in.<br>
          <br>
          On the boards, use normal rules of conduct. Use the debate to arrange
          raids, chit chat or suggest improvement if there is something you
          don’t like. Proper categories have been made for you to use them!<br>
          <br>
          When posting use a consciece subject, bad examples are &quot;Read
          this&quot;, &quot;Very important&quot;, etc. Do not use the boards as
          a place for personal vendetta or flames. This doesn’t mean that
          every sentence need be polished and politically correct: get to the
          point and say what you mean, but please be constructive at any level !<br>

          </font><font face="Arial" size="1"><br>
          Grouping is the thing in Everquest. Always try and group with the
          guild ! Always !<br>
          <br>
          If you are moving into a new place, check with guildies that some move
          with you. For example post on the boards asking if anyone want to camp
          Guk, Sol B, Kanor Castle, etc.<br>
          <br>
          When in a group, always try and foresee when people are leaving and
          ask in guildsay, that in 15 min. you have an opening for a healer,
          tank, nuker, etc. in Lower Guk, Frenzy.<br>
          <br>
          Loot may have been the reason for most disputes on Norath. In Old
          Continent we do not want to be known as ninjalooters, lootwhores or
          similar. Be fair and have a general rule that those that CAN and WILL
          use will roll on an item.<br>
          <br>
          If you enter a group where the object is to gain wealth, be sure you
          agree upon the rules before entering the group or having new members
          on board. Meaning if you enter a group at the Archmagi in lower guk
          and you want to roll on the Shining Metallic Robe, even though you are
          a warrior: say so before!<br>
          <br>
          In OC a guildcamp might have had the purpose to get Ipren out of his
          newbie robe, please notice the difference.<br>

          <br>
          Everyone in Old Continent can set up a raid involving a lot of people.
          In fact we encourage people to do this. There are however some rules
          you most apply to.<br>
          <br>
          * Be sure that everyone joining know the object of the raid. This
          might sound formal, but it need not be. Having fun is a very good
          objective, getting as deep into Chardok might, kill Lord Nagafen, get
          an item from a mob in the Hole you name it!<br>
          <br>
          * Never let down a guildmember. This can be about joining the raid,
          help with corpse retrieval or similar promises. This does not mean
          that you cannot host a 2 group raid on Chardok and that you would have
          to bring everyone. You do not leave or let down a guildmember for
          anything!<br>
          <br>
          * You are now the warlord! This takes planning. Planning is best done
          on the boards. If you are looking to recruit 20 people for a hate raid
          you have best give a week notice.<br>
          <br>
          * Some great guidelines are on our homepage. Best suggestion is to use
          them, or suggest that they’d be improved.<br>
          <br>
          * Notify other guilds that you are going, post on EQVault.<br>

          </font><font face="Arial" size="1"><br>
          When raiding loot rules are simple: We are not loot whores.<br>
          <br>
          * Check the drops and announce them.<br>
          <br>
          * Everyone who CAN and WILL use an item will roll.<br>
          <br>
          * Rotation means, that once you have won a roll on a type of equipment
          you loose your right to roll on that type untill all who CAN and WILL
          use that type of equipment have won such an item. There are four types
          of equipment: normal armor, breastplate, robe and weapons. For example
          you win a piece of armor and next a weapon drops. In this case you are
          allowed to roll on the weapon drop again with a chance to win it.<br>
          <br>
          * Honour – cannot be explained, it is just a common trait for Old
          Continent members. There are no rules for this it simple have to be
          lived… honour makes people pass on rolls for one our the other
          personal reason.<br>

          * Don’t give yourself and Old Continent a bad name with rude
          behaviour in trades OOC or Shouts.<br>
          * Don’t bicker about camp sites, but state your right.<br>
          * Don’t let your first action be to /petition and call a GM if any
          of the Rules of Conduct are broken by others causing harashment to
          you. Seek diplomacy, call in friends and guild … and as a last

                      <br>
                      WHY NOT BEFORE ?<br>
                      We dont want to ignore low level characters but the policy
                      of the guild is to form group able to work on high level
                      zone and as quick as possible to organize planes raids. If
          you are below level 35 you are welcome to join our sister guild <a href="http://continentaldrift.tripod.com/">&lt;Continental
          Drift&gt;</a> which will accept application below the 35 limit.<br>
          <br>
          That will put you on our board for member submission where we will
          discuss your application for a few days. This usually means we ask
          around if we know you for anything bad failing to comply with our
          Rules of Conduct. Most people would never fail in this, but some do
          and we want to play with friendly people and keep up our good
          reputation.<br>
          <br>
          After a few days or maximum 7 days an officer will contact you for an
          invite or tell you if your application has been rejected and why.<br>
          <br>
          The way most people are invited into Old Continent are if you know us.
          Friends want to play with friends. So if you some of us, joining,
          trial period is mostly a formality.<br>

                      At the end of the period if no VETO is registered from

          The weekly camp grounds of the guild will allow us to fight together
          for a common goal! In good time, the weekly camp grounds of the guild
          will be announced. This rule apply from Monday to Friday evening, thus
          not the weekend which is open for raids or whatever you want to do.<br>
          <br>
          Meaning if you group, you group foremost with the guild... lay aside
          personal quests and play and have fun with the guild. That is -
          hopefully - why you joined... this will allow us to focus harder on a
          specific area, quests, rare drop or rare spawns and will ensure that
          when you play you always have a very good chance of finding a group no
          matter your class and no matter which time of day you play.<br>
          <br>
          The groups on weekly guild camp is in no way restricted to
          &quot;guild-only&quot; ... group as much as possible with non-guildies
          and build good relations!<br>
          <br>
          The weekly camp spots will not always be &quot;optimal&quot; for xp,
          but the spot is chosed taking level into concern. The weekly camp spot
          might be several zones close together, but is often only one.<br>
          <br>
          These announcements of the weekly camp spot are decided by the guild
          officers from the ongoing discussions on the forums. These discussions
          are supplemented with polls, so the entire guild has a say, but
          officers will see to it that a fair rotation is enforced and that all
          requests are fairly enqueued.<br>
          <br>
          The weekly campgroup will be divided into 3 groups:<br>
          * Level 30-40<br>
          * Level 40-50<br>
          * Level 46+<br>
          <br>
          Exceptions to the rule - you are of course allowed to go on personal
          quests or plain simple solo from time to time. Such action are liable
          to free guildchat taunting... General &quot;associal&quot; behavior,
          will be questioned and you should as a member consider if Old
          Continent is the right guild for you.<br>
