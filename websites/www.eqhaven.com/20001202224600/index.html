<p><font face="Arial Black">Since &quot;most really good&quot; domain names have already 
been taken, it is likely that any really desirable 
domain that we find available is likely to have been 
previously owned.</font>

<strong><p><font face="Arial Black">All domains hosted here have been checked against
the US Patent and Trademark office's database and
are believed to be non-infringing.</font></strong>


<p><font face="Arial Black">However, we know of no way to reliably determine
conclusively that no identical or confusingly
similar trademarks exist.</font>

<p><font face="Arial Black">(For example, does NBC.com infringe on the rights
and trademark of ABC.com ?  
Would tart.com have a case against start.com and
vice-versa?  Worse, yet, would any domain name containing the letter
 &quot;<a href="letter-mark.htm">X</a>&quot; infringe on Federal Express's recently 
approved 
<a href="letter-mark.htm"><font color="#202040">trademark</font></a> of that letter?)</font>
