The assembled forces of Oboo and their supporters were informed of the result moments later by messenger. The reaction was instant and vicious. Bands of rioters, led by Cania, Snowmaj, Twowolves, and Lilu, stormed southward and engulfed the Qeynos gates in a fury of veangence. Hezlan and his (uncharged) companion Gehnus, were brought down by the raging mobs quickly, and cries of vindication were heard throughout the city. Other guards quickly fell to the invading forces until Corporal Lancot responded<br>to the situation at the gate after being warned by several citizens. The mob dispersed quickly at the counterattack of the guards. But the bloodlust of the mob of Oboo was not completely satisfied. Several<br>demonstration leaders infiltrated the city this time, and distracted Corporal Lancot and Lt. Dagnarok by engaging them in lengthy conversations about gnolls. Vyvyd, Strako and Tanaman performed this dangerous task to prevent these defenders from re-joining the fray. Meanwhile, the rioters returned to the gate and took their full veangence out on the remaining<br>guards. The Bears of Oboo spokesman, Maccoloch, addressed reporters after the mob finished defacating on the Qeynos steps: "Today we sought out to ensure that justice would be done. The court system, run by the man, did not give us justice. So took it upon ourselves to bring (Hezlan) that foul murderer to justice." "We respect everyone's right to 'get upah', and 'get on down', but Hezlan and the thugs who supported him did neither. That just doesn't fly with the Oboo." Maccoloch added, "Whaaaaaaaassaaaaaaaap now, Hezlan?" The rest of the Oboo then stumbled back into Qeynos Hills, blindingly drunk but chanting happily.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The Bears of Oboo, newly re-united with the<br>Reach of Oboo are holding a rally in Qeynos Hills during the final hours of the Guard Hezlan murder trial.  For those of you who haven't followed the<br>proceedings to date, Guard Hezlan, while stationed outside the Qeynos gate last month, allegedly murdered Oboo, a Wolf of the North and a founding member of the Bears of Oboo guild.  Hezlan pled not guilty by reason of self defense, and the trial has been proceeding over the last two weeks.<p>The murder trial is scheduled to finish up Saturday evening at the Qeynos courthouse, and the rally will be held to coincide with the jury deliberations.  The Bears of Oboo, a guild made up of barbarians and<br>erudites, and the Reach of Oboo, a guild made up of Dark Elves, Ogres and Trolls, have decided to merge and join forces and voices in this rally for justice.<p>We are calling all members of the oppressed races of Norrath to join us in our protest rally.  This trial is not about the murder of one martyr, it is about equality and freedom throughout the land.<p>Join us on Saturday, April 8 at 6:00 pm EDT in Qeynos Hills and let your voice be heard.  We will not accept anything less than justice.<p>For the background on the murder and the trial, visit the Bears of Oboo website at <A HREF="http://oboo.tripod.com" TARGET="_blank">http://oboo.tripod.com</A>.
