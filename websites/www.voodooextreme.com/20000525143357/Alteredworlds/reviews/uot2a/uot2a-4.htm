    <p>Ran out and killed an alligator...pretty standard...</p>
    <p>Wandered north a bit a found a Fire Lizard...woohoo. It's an alligator that lives in
    Lava. And shoots fireballs. And has way more health.</p>
    <p>That seems to be the theme of the monsters in UO:T2A...more health. I was wandering
    around and found a Cyclopean Warrior (which, by the way, has some of the nicest graphics
    of any of the new monsters). No problem...equip the ol' Bardiche and thump...thump...I'm
    missing like 40 health. In the space of about 2 seconds...arrgh. After switching to a
    heavy xbow and nailing the beast about 30 times (I'm not kidding) it finally dies...blah.</p>
    <p>So I continue wandering, and I spot another Cyclops. Hey this one doesn't even have a
    weapon :). I check and discover this beastie is called a Titan. I also discovered just how
    fast I can run. Titan's seem to have about 3 times as much health as the Cyclopean
    Warriors, and they throw E-Bolts at you to boot...run away, run away...</p>
    <p>There are some nice monsters though...the Wyvern is cool (other than reusing the same
    old Dragon/Drake/Wyrm graphics). Same treasure, health and combat damage as a dragon,
    minus the flaming breath. Woohoo...and they don't dispel EV's or Blade Spirits either.
    Stone Gargoyles are another fun one...again, way more health than a run-of-the-mill
    gargoyle, but no spell ability. And lots of goodies on the corpse!</p>
    <p>If you want to get really, REALLY nasty, you can take on the Ophidians or the
    Terathans. Both have a fairly easy grunt, up to the Matriarch/Queen which would give The
    Lord of The Abyss more than a run for his money. Unless it comes up as a warrior or a
    drone...bring friends...many many friends...I watched 5 people take on an Ophidian
    Archmage and just barely survive...was a good show though...</p>
    <p>Another thing you'll notice right away...people riding around on weird ass
    Ostrich/Lizard looking things called Ostards (Thank god no one used the names people came
    up with in a certain contest :). They run fast, they fight hard, and you can tame them :).
    I've heard that if you have them guarding you when you die, they will fight off 9 out of
    10 monsters...and even a few players. I still haven't seen a Nightmare. It's supposed to
    look like a horse and fight like a dragon. Apparently you can tame these too, with about
    as much success as taming an Ancient Wyrm.</p>
    <p>As far as the fauna of the new lands goes...it's a bloody maze. Some of it's not bad,
    but I think someone at OSI went a wee bit crazy on the 3D terrain idea. Most of the areas
    I travelled to had low lying areas surrounded by wall like hills. Or hills that made me
    feel like I was walking across a braille novel. Nothing earth shaterringly bad...but, it
    did bring up two major problems...</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - First, it can be very difficult to get were you want to go. Expect to do
    a fair amount of back tracking until you can figure out where everything is...</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Second, monsters seemed to love to sit on top of the &quot;walls&quot;
    or get stuck on hills, leaving them lobbing spells/flames at you, or letting you kill them
    easily with arrows, and ending up with no easy way to get to their treasure.</p>
    <p>Oh, final word of warning on the beasties in the new lands...those wonderful little
    mongbat looking things called Imps spit out fireballs...annoying as hell when five or six
    of them show up. Although I hear rumors that you can tame them...</p>
