    <p align="right"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">by <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a> (May 24, 1998)</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Sacrates does it again! You guys want more
    info on Valhalla? You came to the right place. We stuck everything but the kitchen sink in
    this Interview and came out with some grade A unhomogonized smack!</font></p>
    <hr width="75%" size="1" color="#D700D7">
    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Sacrates: Well let's get this started with
    the perfunctory introductions etc. Who are you, where do you come from, Social Security
    number, What you do and a small sample of DNA for the books.</font><font size="2"><br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ryan: Dammit, start out with the tough
    ones! :) The name's Ryan Dueckman, I'm from the outskirts of Vancouver up here in
    beautiful BC, Canada. When I'm not cruisin' around in my decked-out '92 Geo Storm (Where
    the hell is my Farrarri?!), I work as game designer and animator for Delphic Oracle
    Entertainment.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    Sacrates: Ok with that out of the way...on with the show. Valhalla, not only a cool name
    but very nice looking game. Could you give us an idea of how far into development you are
    % wise?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">:
    About 10% at this point. (Don't start lining up outside the EB's quite yet!)<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    Sacrates:&nbsp; Lets hit a few Engine related questions. Is this a hardware only based
    game or will you have Software support in it also? If it's hardware, what types of nice
    stuff do you have in store for Voodoo 2 owners?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">:
    OGRE is a hardware-only engine. Part of the reason we're so early on in the development
    was the decision to scrap software entirely, and rewrite the engine from scratch to be
    fully hardware dependant. As for nice stuff for Voodoo2 owners? The OGRE engine is
    designed to support ANY feature a new graphics card can throw at us. Materials in the game
    consist of over 12 different properties, including reflection maps, bump maps, opacity
    maps, and any other properties you'd find in a professional rendering package like 3D
    Studio MAX. Supporting a new feature in a new card is as simple as turning it on in the
    driver. Curved surfaces and terrain are also tesselated in real-time to achieve the
    highest possible polygon count while maintaining a high framerate. You've seen screenshots
    of it running on a P5-133 with a Rendition 2100 card at 25 frames per second, imagine how
    it'll look on a PII-400 with a Voodoo 3! (We can only dream :) )<br>

    <br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Sacrates: I noticed in the shots that the sky looks
    incredible. Will you have day and night affects in the game also? Or maybe rain and snow
    etc? Basically what types of environmental affects will be in?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">: The
    gameworld is a totally dynamic one. Weather changes take place as you play, the sun moves
    slowly across the sky, day changes to night... We're trying to make Midgard feel as real
    as possible.</font><br>
    <br>
    <font face="Tahoma" size="2">Sacrates:&nbsp;Also there are quite a few shots with Water in
    them. Will you have simulated waves or rippling affects in the water like Unrea</font><font SIZE="1">l?</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    </font><br>
    <font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ryan: Both will be present. Larger bodies of
    water(Such as the ocean) can only be realistically represented with large waves, whereas
    with smaller bodies(Lakes, ponds) we'll probably go for a ripple/reflection map.<br>
    </font><br>
    <font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    Sacrates: The main character bears a striking resemblence to a well known Plumber&nbsp; we
    know for consoles. Is he an earlier descendent of this character? (If he is...please don't
    say he has Butt Stomp capabilities or I will stop this review here and now!) Basically
    what I am saying is since the game has a more animated light hearted look to it, will it
    be more serious action or a deep story to it?<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ryan: The &quot;cute&quot; character
    you see in the screenshots is just there as a placeholder until we get the animation
    system fully implemented. The characters in the final version will probably be rendered
    more realistically.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">The story behind Valhalla
    centers around the oncoming of Ragnarok,which is by definition grim, violent, and
    apocalyptic. However, this is above all a GAME, which means it has to be FUN, so we try to
    deal with the subject matter in a suitably light-hearted way.</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sacrates: I also hear we may be able to form a group of people or a party in this game?
    Will we have NPC's with us on this adventure and will we be able to do it online also?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">:
    Hey, Vikings NEVER travelled alone :).. In normal single-player mode, you can have up to 7
    NPC Vikings that you can order around using simple goal-based commands, or you can hook up
    to the internet and have 7 friends travel with you. This also brings up some very
    interesting multiplayer possibilities. (Clans anyone? :) )</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sacrates: Basically I jumped the gun with that last question. What types of Internet
    support will you be adding to the game?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">:
    Cooperative is a definite must. A game like this BEGS to be played with others :)..
    Deathmatch is also planned, and we're looking at the logistics of setting up a virtual
    online world, where clans of vikings can travel from town to town battling for supremacy
    against other clans. That's something I'd definitely be interested in</font><font SIZE="1">.</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sacrates: There is also the fact that we can use anything as a weapon in the game? So with
    that said...will I be able to chop off a good friends arm in Multiplayer and use it to
    bludgeon another good friend?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">:
    It's very possible. :)</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sacrates: What style will combat be? Will there be any sophisticated styles of attacks
    like Chopping, jabbing, Slicing, parrying etc.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">:
    Play balance and control is something we're spending a lot of time developing right now.
    No third-person game on the market to date really has what I would say to be
    &quot;perfect&quot; play control, so that's something we'd really like to remedy.</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sacrates: What kinds of physics can we expect to see in Valhalla? Will I be able to get
    into combat and knock someone down? Or since this little Viking guy is fairly stocky will
    he trip and roll down a hill?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">: You
    will be able to throw an axe, see it arc through the air, hit a peasant on a hill, and you
    will laugh as the peasant flies through the air. The peasant will land, roll down the
    hill, and come to rest at the bottom. The blood will stain the ground. How's that for
    physics?</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sacrates: What type of storyline do you have set for the game so far? Will it be a story
    based game and will we talk to any NPC's etc?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">: The
    game is story based, although we're not about to release the details of the story quite
    yet.(I think I said too much in an earlier question already :) ). The game plays very
    nonlinear, with multiple distinct endings, and any number of paths to take along the way.<br>
    </font><br>
    <font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    Sacrates: Will there be anything to ride in the world? (Horses, Ostriches, other humans
    etc?) And since it will be one large world....just how big will it be?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">:
    There will be of course a Viking Longboat for you to carry your crew around in(After all,
    it would take more than an hour to walk in a straight line from one corner of the world to
    the other!) There are some others, but I think our programmers would lynch me if I said
    any more :)</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sacrates: What type of gameplay can we expect? Will there be a lot of combat or more
    puzzle solving etc?<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ryan: There will be a balance between
    combat and exploration. One of the goals in the game is to model any major structures
    after their real-life counterparts, to give players a feeling that they're exploring a
    real location rather than just hacking their way through a random maze. The difficulty
    doesn't come from finding Key B to open Door X to enter Corridor W, it comes from working
    your way through a real location to where the treasure would be stored in it's real-life
    counterpart. The game's big enough without having to worry about getting lost!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Sacrates: Will we be able to sing happy Viking songs
    about Death, Destruction and Raping and pillaging towns in the game? Or will that just be
    your background music?<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ryan: Absolutely! Death, destruction,
    raping and pillaging towns are all integral to progression in the game! (Well, except for
    the rape part, I don't think we really need that). And hey, if we get enough people asking
    for it, we may even throw a big musical number in there somewhere!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Sacrates: And finally....when, since it is still
    fairly early in development, can we expect to see this in stores? Just spit out a relative
    time.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF00FF">Ryan: We're hoping March '99</font></font></p>
    <font SIZE="1"><p align="left"></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Thanks for the
    Interview Ryan. We hope to see and hear much more about this game soon! With that said
    will you be at E3? And do you by chance have a spare Pic or two gathering dust somewhere
    in your vaults that we could toss&nbsp; up with the Interview? Anyway, great looking stuff
    and I can;t wait to get my paws on it!</font></p>
    <font SIZE="1"><p align="left"></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Hey,
    I'm just glad to be able to finally talk about it! Unfortunately, we probably won't be at
    E3 this year(Unless we can find ourselves a publisher willing to foot the bill). I can't
    get you a new screenshot right now because we're right in the middle of throwing in a
    whole slew of new effects, but if you can wait a couple weeks I'll see if I can get you
    some exclusives..</font></p>
