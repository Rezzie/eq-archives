    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">Everyone's working hard,

      which is important mostly because of the two imminent time sinks known as the CGDC

      (Computer Game Developers Conference) and E3 (you know). I've been going to the CGDC for

      years. Every trip has been worthwhile, but my last visit was eaten up by all of the

      publisher meetings as I tried to schlep WoT--what a pain. Now, I'm looking forward to

      actually attending a few seminars, schmoozing at the parties, and catching up with a few

      old friends. <br>

      <br>

      Soap box time: I've always enjoyed the CGDC because it was focused on giving hard-core

      game developers a place to gather and exchange information (with the occasional bozo in

      the mix--which was fun, but for entirely different reasons). It used to be that, if you

      tried really hard, you might be able to spot something other than a tee shirt and jeans.

      Nowadays, the suits are starting to view the conference as just another place to do

      business. Regardless of the fact that I did exactly this last year selling WoT, I don't

      like the trend. There's a time to focus on marketing and PR, a place where every

      conversation should be filled with buzzwords, and it ain't CGDC. Speaking of which... <br>

      <br>

      <b>I've got nothing against a world of hype as long as it's not masquerading as anything

      else, and our friend E3 is no hypocrite. This will be my first time there and I'm really

      looking forward to it. I'm anxious partially because, as a designer, I have a lot to say

      about this game that has been kept quiet--I've got some really impressive stuff to reveal

      and I can't wait to do so--but I also want to see E3's traditional millions in marketing

      money spent everywhere I look. As long as the publisher (which will obviously be announced

      sometime between now and then) is footing the bill, I'm planning on surrounding myself

      with official WoT chain-mail bikini babes (that's a joke, Sabrina)! According to lots of

      sources, E3 is like nothing else, and it's a show not to be missed. Let's hope they don't

      keep me chained up in that little room forever! <br>

      <br>

      </b>On to the actual work: I've divided up the story into its component missions,

      objectives, cut scenes, and assets, then started to assign them to the level designers,

      artists, and animators. It's much easier to run towards the finish line when the race

      course is clearly defined. But all of this only confirmed that The Wheel of Time is going

      to be an epic game. In the last week, fantastic new architectural sketches, magic effects,

      and textures have flowed in--but the size of the game had me worrying a little about our

      ability to create everything with the same attention to detail displayed in the microcosm.

      This is why I'm ecstatic to have introduced another artist to the team. Like many of the

      other team members, I'd worked with this talented fine-artst extensively on previous

      games, so she's already proven her abilities. I'm expecting nothing but the best. When you

      add her to the art team already in place, the epic scope isn't nearly as scary. Of course,

      this means I no longer have the money to hire an assistant producer... :-( <br>

      <br>

      I'm actually particularly busy right now with all of this, so you won't find a letters

      section this week. I do appreciate everyone's response to last week's column; many of you

      thought it was the best yet. Of course I intend to keep on doing it, but making this game

      has to take precedence over meaningless drivel. Thanks for tuning in. I promise to be much

      more meaningless next week. <br>

      <br>

      Until then!</font></small></p>

      on a full two months of QA, meaning the game will be out in the mid-late summer. Interplay

      has four teams planned to intensively QA the game around the clock, plus another team

      here. Each QA team is 4-5 people. Probably the greatest challenge will be to QA the

      multiplayer component of the game, which though it has exactly the same story as the

      single player game, is more complex because of the interactions between multiple people.</font></small></p>

    been a dying art form in the theatre and media. It has remained alive in novels and video

    games only. When a studio attempts to make a fantasy most of them wash up and dry with not

    a hint of atmosphere. A few films I think that were actually true to the fantasy element

    were movies like Excalibur and Dragonslayer. But how old are they? Until now I thought

    that they would never again get the mixture right....but Merlin is a fair stab at it. A

    made for TV movie of all things?!! Anyway, excuse this post but I think it's about time

    <blockquote>

      <p><font size="2"><font color="#FF00FF"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Joe: Some people have

      indicated they might not like the one PC with up to five NPCs for a party. In multiplayer,

      it seems that six PCs can be created and used as a party. Would it be possible to start a

      multiplayer game with six PCs but the host plays all of them? This pseudo-networking would

      give a single player the option of playing between 1-6 PCs with the balance as NPCs if

      desired.</font></font></p>

      <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="2">BioWare's Ray Muzyka : Yes.

      Though the only practical issue this would help is to allow you to create all of your

      initial party. So, if you really, really want to create all of the characters in your

      party, we have decided to allow you to do this by playing the game in multiplayer mode and

      creating all of the characters. It's actually a side benefit of multiplayer mode, but we

      debated against locking this out but thought we'd allow it in case you want to do this.</font><font size="2"></p>

      <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="2">This (creating your entire

      party as first level characters off the start) may sound appealing, but I must really

      recommend you play with as many NPC's turned PC's as possible (at least in single player

      mode), and here's why (or at least why I would):</font><font size="2"></p>

      <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="2">1) You have a lot of NPC's

      to choose from - and whether they join you (and become PC's) is entirely up to you. You

      choose if an NPC leaves, too, unless you p*ss (sorry, annoy - the browser filter got me

      too here!) one off (the NPC PC's have feelings too)</font><font size="2"></p>

      <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="2">2) The NPC's interact with

      each other in interesting and amusing ways - ala Jagged Alliance (great game)</font><font size="2"></p>

      <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="2">3) We spent a lot of time

      writing dialogue and a lot of money recording NPC sounds - and created PC's won't have any

      unless you record some for them (yes, you can do this, but the created PC's have fewer

      sound slots than do the PC's that once were NPC's).</font><font size="2"></p>

      <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="2">When I refer to NPC's I mean

      any character that is not part of your party. PC's on the other hand are either characters

      you create OR NPC's that you have asked to join your party.</font><font size="2"></p>

      <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="2">Lord RumblePants of

      FallenPyre: I must inquire if the multiplayer setup will be hosted by something similar to

      that of battle.net where one can meet other gamers and share a jug of ale and a tale or

      two.</font><font size="2"></p>

      <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="2">Interplay's Chris Parker:

      This is actually something that we've been trying to figure out for awhile now. The

      current plan is just for TCP/IP,LAN,modem. However, since some service providers assign

      users IP addresses every time they log on, some users may have difficulty finding their

      host.</font><font size="2"></p>

      <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="2">So, we are thinking of

      putting up at least a dedicated chat board that people can alt tab to and find other

      players for their games (BG will tell the user their IP address from the multiplayer

      screen).</font><font size="2"></p>

      <p></font><font color="#FF00FF"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">We'll see. Interplay

      is supposed to have a Battle.net server system up sometime soon, but that would take more

      programming time....so don't count on it. The chat situation is more likely.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><!-- byline --> &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></p>

    many questions alone. Yeah BG is using 2D also....but it has been in development for a

        <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="-1">The demo starts right

        before the Makoro reactor and your party must make its way to the Golden Saucer. Once you

        reach the Golden Saucer, the demo ends. </font><font size="-1"></p>

        <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="-1">FMV is seamless just like

        the PlayStation version, but the quality is no where near - in other words, you can see

        the transitions because they stick out like sore thumbs. </font><font size="-1"></p>

        <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="-1">Despite the game running at

        30+ FPS, the character animation is still rather choppy. In fact, other than the animation

        running a tad faster, owners of the PSX version will notice no difference. </font><font size="-1"></p>

        <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="-1">This game is incredibly

        sharp. Playing it in a crisp 640x480 environment makes it all worth while for me. </font><font size="-1"></p>

        <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="-1">Playable characters in the

        demo include: Cloud, Aerith, Barret, Red 6, and Tifa. </font><font size="-1"></p>

        <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="-1">A variety of spells are in

        the demo such as bolt, cure, fire and the first two levels of every charaters' Limit

        Breaks. </font><font size="-1"></p>

        <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="-1">Each character also

        possesses one Summoning Materia. For instance, Cloud has Bahamut, Barret has Ifrit, and

        Aerith has Chocobo attack. </font><font size="-1"></p>

        <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="-1">Music is identical to the

        <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="-1">Backgrounds are pixelated

        <p></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF" size="-1">Barret's lame Ebonics are

        still present. The Final Fantasy VII demo should be available within the next two to three

      <i><p></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Why, if we will have 100%

      control of NPCs, why can't we create and play<br>

      &gt;more than one character? </small></font></p>

      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Actually, you can, in multiplayer

      mode. I should have mentioned this last message - sorry about that. Just spawn a new game,

      create all of the party if you like, and play away (by yourself if you wish). We debated

      locking this feature out, but decided to leave it in so that if you really, really wanted

      to create the entire party, you'd have a way to do it and still play the single player

      game. </small></font></p>

      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>I recommend you try the NPC's though,

      and here is my reasoning: </small></font></p>

      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>1) the NPC's have personality - they

      interact with each other similar to the way the characters interacted in Jagged Alliance

      (great game)<br>

      2) the NPC's have voices, while the PC's don't until you record some for them (yes, you

      can do this, but there are fewer voice slots available for created PC's than PC's that

      once were NPC's)<br>

      3) you can choose who joins you and who leaves you (unless you piss off one of the NPC's

      and they leave)<br>

      4) we spent a lot of time writing dialogue and a lot of money recording sounds for the

      NPC's who can become PC's - trust me, they're good characters for your party. </small></font></p>

      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>But, failing this, you have a legit

      way to create all of the party if you like (i.e. in multiplayer mode) - hope you enjoy the

      game either way!</small></font></p>

      running the game with a 16-bit palette instead of the standard 256 colours that the Quake

      characters in the game to do torso twists (MechWarrior-like), and we're working on

      enhancing the AI. There will also be cutscenes in the game to help build a richer plot. </font></p>

    that Jason Struck of<a href="http://www.igs.net/"> Tinman Studios</a>, you know the

    Gothica folks... has revealed some sweet details about the game on the message board...</font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF"><strong>How is your

      hero controlled? by mouse or keyboard? also, is the terrain a grid or can u take a step,

      or a 1/2 step, or whatever. is it possible to have weapon controls? like ctrl-left is

      slash left, and so on? </strong><br>

      <br>

      &quot; In Gothica, you can control the character using the keyboard, joystick, or mouse.

      There are no predefined step amounts and no grids. The world is created using our world

      cad editor (check out the shot on our web site) in true 3D. Walls and surfaces don't have

      any restrictions. We are working on a system of multiple attack types in Gothica. We are

      also thinking about using special shield blocks as well. &quot; <br>

      <br>

      <strong>How are the townspeople in Gothica?</strong> <br>

      <br>

      &quot; Right now we have a town that we are working on with towns people. Each town person

      is controlled by a script that allows him/her to carry out a unique daily schedule. You

      can converse which each person and they will all have different conversations. We don't

      have simple shops such as an armory that sells everything. Instead, shops are very

      specialized. This allows for unique shops that sell unique items in special areas. &quot; <br>

      <br>

      <strong>How does archery work in Gothica? </strong><br>

      <br>

      &quot; Since Gothica is true 3D, there are a lot of cool things that work perfectly (and

      physically) in full 3D. Archery is one of them. There is an archery skill in Gothica. This

      affects many things. Some include: your ability to use certain bows, draw strength, firing

      rate, distance, and aiming skill. You have to physically aim at the creature. Then,

      depending on your skill, the arrow may home in on a more vital area. &quot; <br>

      <br>

      <strong>When your hero gets damaged, will he react? </strong><br>

      <br>

      &quot; Force is a factor in combat. Hitting a creature, or being hit by a creature, all

      cause some sort of force to come into play. The large bone worm creature seen on our page

      can pack an incredible forceful blow. One that can actually throw your character back

      pretty hard. Body part damage does not affect the character. It does affect monsters

      though. You can cut off or smash limbs, heads, etc. A kill swing might behead a creature

      and send it's head rolling across the ground with a sick bounce. &quot; <br>

      <br>

      <strong>In the main screen of the page, it says you do stuff for good or evil. How will

      that effect how things happen in the story? Can you specifically choose evil or good? What

      would happen along the lines of enemies?</strong> <br>

      <br>

      &quot; If you are in a city and you choose to kill a townsperson, the guards will come.

      They don't magically appear, but will come running from where they were. It's possible to

      get away, but just like real life, being a murderer is difficult. If you escape the town,

      the next time you come back, depending on the elapsed time and your appearance, guards

      will have a chance (based on distance) of recognizing you. If this happens, you are in a

      battle/run for your life again. &quot; <br>

      <br>

      <strong>Is there anything planned for guilds both ingame/outgame in Gothica? <br>

      </strong><br>

      &quot; We want people to create Gothica guilds so chances are we will have usermade skins,

      logos and team flags. There will also be NPC guilds in the Gothica. &quot; </font></p>

      the &quot;big titles&quot; that were covered on gaming news sites, and in times here at

      PsychoNews, were 3D Action shooters. Those times are over. Role-Playing Games, RPGs, are

      being developed currently in the big numbers. There are a load of new RPG's currently

      being developed that will feature the latest technology and gameplay. Jeff Dempster, our

      very own RPGer has come up with an editorial that deals with the history and a grand look

      to the future. Check out this MASSIVE editorial right over here. Enjoy</font></p>
