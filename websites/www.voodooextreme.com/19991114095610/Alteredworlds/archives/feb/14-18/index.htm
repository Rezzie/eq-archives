    I can safely say there is *no* 'expansion pak' being planned for UO. That is, unless the
    UO team and everyone I work with on a daily basis is conspiring to keep this a big secret
    from me just so I'll be clueless. That's it... It's probably just some big joke being
    played on me, being 'hung out to dry' on the ng for the pleasure &amp; fun of it all ;) </font></p>
    <p><font color="#008080">Seriously, one thing that might not be apparent to those not
    working in the industry: game magazines (or any other industry print media) have about a 3
    month lead time. This would put NextGen interviewing RG around oh... November '97 time
    frame. There *may* have been ideas being tossed around at that time for an expansion pak,
    but it's certainly not on the calendar today. </font></p>

    understand and play this one. There are many people out there who equate jumping into a

      day yesterday - we haven't done that for a while. Sent a whole swak of stuff to Interplay
      to start up QA for the game. Processing icons to their newer/better swanky selves. They
      look quite sharp. Final terrain is to be finished for Monday; the city of Baldur's Gate is
      so incredibly sweet.we can't convey it to you guys in mere words. Russ is working on the
      backgrounds for the cutscenes. They look great. The end movies are done and are just being
      rendered. Terrain is completed and just touch-ups remain. All but the background scenes
      are rendered and completed, all of the characters are modeled and animated.and processed.
      The large creatures are being processed this week. The animations themselves are quite
      amazing; these monsters are going to scare the living bejeebers out of you! ;) With 98% of
      the art complete, one might think &quot;Woohoo! Almost done!!&quot; but a good deal of the
      work is still ahead. Data entry is a HUGE undertaking that will give more than a few
      people (us included!) nightmares. The data entry/QA team is being worked like dogs here at
      BioWare, and it's still not enough. People are pitching in to help out the guys who are
      now, and until the end of the project, really in the trenches. </font></p>

    restricted to being on one or the other TMU (simplifying a bit here). There is some
    benefit over only having 2 mb of memory, but it isn't double. You will see more texture
