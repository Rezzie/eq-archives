      best RPGs this year. This is a follow up to an interview conducted

    <hr>

      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font><font color="#8080C0">:
      </font>Where did Ross Systems come from? How/When was it formed?<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font><font color="#8080C0">: </font><font color="#C1C1FF">Ross
      Systems came from Myself, Kevin&nbsp;Ross. The company originally started doing PC/Network Repairs, and then a sub section spun off to do Game
      Development.&nbsp;We did this for numerous reasons, the biggest being me. I am a avid player of RPG games. I was tired of playing
      games where the plots were non-existent, that were copies, or had a world
      that forced you to
      play only one way. I also did not like fighting a Orc that looked like a
      lizard man with&nbsp; just a different skin and so on. I also have some
      nagging from some friends who stated, 'hey, your RPG modules are great, why
      not spin them into a game so we can all play?' So I began the task of doing
      this. The project first began as a trainer for the World, then it was put
      to a ray casting type engine and now a fully online, 6DOF BSP engine. Each
      step involved re-writing the graphics and code but always insuring the core rules
      stayed the same. This has worked to my advantage.&nbsp; The actual structure of&nbsp;
      Unknown has never really changed, the data is the same as when I
      started.&nbsp; The graphics, and technology have just become more intense. I
      feel that the graphics and the language need to work around the world. The
      world should not be controlled or limited by the language or the system
      using it.</font></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font>: How
      many people does Ross Systems employ?</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font>: <font color="#C1C1FF">This
      is hard to answer since we have two sides to Ross Systems. <span class="910184711-11052000">The
      Development&nbsp;section has&nbsp;</span>10&nbsp;<span class="910184711-11052000">people&nbsp;</span>working
      on the project at&nbsp;<span class="910184711-11052000">this time</span>.<span class="910184711-11052000">&nbsp;We
      also have&nbsp;2 Modelers from Kaid Software assisting us on animating
      models and&nbsp;also creating skins for us.&nbsp;</span>We have hired
      a studio to help us finish up textures for the Unknown as well.<span class="910184711-11052000">
      I have purposely kept the team small to insure quality
      in the game. Each person knows his/her section inside and out. Because of
      this we have been able to keep the same look and feel throughout Krythoth,&nbsp;adhere to the core
      rules and the novels of Krythoth.</span></font></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font>: Do you
      have a publisher for the game or are you looking for one?</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font>: <font color="#C1C1FF">No,
      we plan to look for a publisher once the official beta test begins. We do
      not want to be pressured by a publisher asking us 'are you done yet?' or 'is
      this done yet?' I&nbsp;<span class="910184711-11052000">want this world to
      be done when I say so, not when the public or the publisher want it done.&nbsp;If
      a publisher with the same thinking as us here stepped up we would be more than happy to talk to them.</span></font></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font><span class="910184711-11052000"><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font>Are you or anyone from Ross Systems going to E3?</span></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font><span class="910184711-11052000"><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font><font color="#C1C1FF">Yes, 2 people from Ross Systems will be
      nosing around. We were going to set up, but with some internal problems (lawyers issues), we did not. We are looking into the next major conference
      now. This would be our first public release of the Unknown.&nbsp;</font></span></font>
      <p align="left"><font color="#F4F0F4"><font size="2">Certis</font></font><font size="2"><span class="910184711-11052000"><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font>How far into the Alpha test of Unknown are you? How many people are
      involved so far?</span></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font><span class="910184711-11052000"><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font><font color="#C1C1FF">We are into what we want to call prealpha40.
      Since the conception of the Unknown, we have had between 114-150 testers.
      These are testers within a 50 mile radius of Ross Systems. It has allowed
      us the ability to hold meetings, user groups and so on to work out issues
      in a group and not over email. We meet at least 1 a month, sometimes twice
      to 4 times a month to get problems worked out in a group. They have been
      great supporting the Unknown, and&nbsp;a great asset to the us here. It
      has allowed my team and myself to concentrate on the lands and not
      testing. We have written DEBUG commands&nbsp;and taught the testers on how
      to use them which has actually allowed&nbsp;them to assist us on fixing problems.&nbsp;</font></span></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font>:
      MMORPGs released in the last year have not been as story intensive as some
      would hope. You mentioned plots in <a href="Unknown.htm">our last
      interview</a>, could you explain exactly what plots are and how they will
      be implemented&nbsp;in both multiplayer and single player?</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font>: <font color="#C1C1FF">Plots
      and quests are actually two different entities in the Unknown. Quests are
      as they sound.&nbsp; A task is given to a player or players to complete and
      then receive an award. They are done in simplest terms. Plots on the
      other hand are actual programs built into the world to be played out.
      We have over 200+ plots inside the Unknown. These plots can spin off from quests, or even
      from other plots. The staff of Ross Systems will play some of
      these plots, while others are played by the NPC’s. They are actual
      events of the lands. Before you ask , here's a small
      example. Orcs will begin to raid the city of Aquatish. The plot might be
      to find out why; a quest might be for you to rescue the city. We will not
      spawn 100 Orcs to attack the city, they will actually gather up
      somewhere before the attack.</font></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font><font color="#0000ff">:</font>
      Developers have often talked about what a large task it is to create a
      compelling multiplayer experience. How has developing both a single and
      multiplayer component with such a small team affected development?</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font><font color="#0000ff">:</font><font color="#C1C1FF">
      To be honest, the development of multi-player and single player has not
      created much of a problem at all. We have always looked at the Unknown as a
      single player game first. Multi-player came afterwards. We do strongly
      believe to have a great multi-player game you have to have a great single
      player game. You must have a base to start on and work off of.</font></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font><font color="#0000ff">:</font>
      There are a few features you mentioned in our last interview that left me&nbsp;quite
      excited. Owning a house, purchasing a guild hall, riding a horse (big one
      there) and flight. Are these features still being implemented?&nbsp;</font>
      <p align="left"><font color="#F4F0F4"><font size="2">Kevin Ross</font></font><font size="2"><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font><font color="#C1C1FF">Owning a house is still inside the world. We
      have a finite amount, so get them while you can. Guild homes can still be
      purchased. Riding a horse is still supported. And yes, flight is supported
      also.</font></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font><font color="#0000ff">:</font>
      In our last interview you were unable to disclose any information&nbsp;about&nbsp;the
      game engine. Can you give us any details on its capabilities?</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font><font color="#C1C1FF">We can go into a little detail about our game
      engine. We have signed NDA’s with key people not to discuss core
      abilities of the engine. We have taken a core engine and actually written
      100's of API's of our own within it. Overall it is a 6 DOF engine, with
      almost every feature underneath the sun. We do support colored lighting;
      colored FOG, alpha transparency, multi-screen resolutions, surround sound
      support, MP3 support, 3ds models importation, model shadows, multi-layer
      skies and so on. We do plan to release a world editor and model editor
      within the engine. We feel this will allow the players the ability to edit
      their homes, or player skins, to allow for more customization within the
      game.</font></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font>How will Unknown distinguish itself among the slew of new online
      RPGs being released in the next year?</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font><font color="#0000ff">:</font><font color="#C1C1FF">
      I believe what makes the Unknown different than other games is a few
      things. One is that we are Unknown. We have kept ourselves small and
      quiet. This has allowed us to devote our time in the world’s
      development. What is going to make us stand out is our attention to
      detail, and the way we listen to users. Another is that your actions, no
      matter how big or small, could have dire effects upon the entire world of
      Krythoth. From the person who draws the wand of G’thol to the person who
      finds the Hall of Heroes, the world will always change, not just by the
      plots that are going on within it but by what the users request us to do.</font></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font>Which features in Unknown are you the most proud of?</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font><font color="#C1C1FF">The features we are most proud of the unknown
      are our models and stories. We actually use 28 different player models
      and over 100+ monster models within the Unknown. Our player models exceed
      almost 1200 frames of animation each and some of our monsters exceed 2000
      frames, not counting the NPC models you will see throughout the Unknown.
      The Unknown plots and stories are the strongest you will have ever seen in a
      RPG world. We have 5 novels written, which allows us to shape and prepare
      our coding to the next chapter. The world has a future.&nbsp; It is not
      being made up
      or created after the fact but was all laid out to begin with.</font></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font><font size="2"><span class="910184711-11052000"><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font>Personal question, when do I get a crack at this bad boy? ;)</span></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font><span class="910184711-11052000"><font color="#0000ff">:
      </font><font color="#C1C1FF">We are finishing up our last major problem -
      our Plot problem. A dedicated server that actually
      controls plots within the Unknown worlds is key to the actual
      development of the Land of Krythoth. During our last test, we actually
      turned the server on to insure that our plots would start. We found a
      serious bug that allowed the users, if cunning enough, to find out about
      plots before they could happen. So we are re-coding this area now. At this
      time I am 75% done.&nbsp; We need at least another 4-5
      weeks to finish up.</font></span></font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Certis</font><font color="#0000ff">:</font>
      The compulsory question: How much of Unknown is complete right now?</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4">Kevin Ross</font>: <font color="#C1C1FF">We
      are over the 65% mark.&nbsp; I can say this with ease. We are
      actually heading down the home stretch. Not as
      fast I would like, but our motto has never changed. It will be done
      when I say it is done. This world is one never seen before and we want to set
      the new stage of RPG world creation. A new standard has to be set forth,
      and we believe the small guys can do it.</font></font>
