      <i><font face="arial" size="2"><p align="left"></font></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">&quot;Many of you have been wondering when the next version of M2

      will be released, and what's going on. What's happening is that M2 is currently being

      reviewed for distribution as a full commercial version. News on this deal should be public

      within the next month if all goes well. I have been working very hard on the success of

      Mordor, and have not had time lately to deal with bug reports and user issues that I did

      before. I apologize for this, but it has been necessary to work on the finalization deal

      for Mordor 2 to go commercial. I will keep all of you informed as to what happens by

      posting a news item as soon as the information is made available. Right now, I don't have

      a release date for 0.993b since many things are currently being rewritten. Let's just say

      that with 0.993b, you won't be disappointed. Thank you for your patience, and enjoy!&quot;</font></p>

      <i><p align="left"></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">&quot;My focus

      in Avaris is going to be to develop ground breaking NPC AI. To this end I am researching

      things like neural networks, artificial life theory, game theory and other such things.

      Much of my schooling is in studying behavior (animal and human, but specializing in

      monkeys and apes). I'm hoping to integrate many behavior theories into the NPCs of the

      game so that Avaris can be a non-linear world that is not a series of preprogrammed

      events....</font></p>

    fine looking mag kiddies and I highly suggest getting yourself a copy. (Just as long as

    you don't get the pages all sticky) I also noticed a few new pics of EQ I have never seen

    before in it! Also, I picked up the Foresaken demo and although it has no relation at all

    to RPG's the shots on the back looked sweet. So I popped this little pill in my drive and

    sat back in near shock. If you have a 3D card (And you better have one if you read this

    site) then this thing will make you projectile vomit across a room full of Yentas. I

    swear, I have never witnessed graphics that look that sweet before. However, with that

    said....it is JUST a shooter. Give me EQ and i'll be a happy wet turd I swear. - <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a></small></font></p>

      faceless heroes of first-person games. Rather than the gun being the focal point, players

      will spend their time looking at Corvus. They will see him cast visually dazzling spells,

      feel every flesh-burning incantation, and cringe as he is unexpectedly knocked into a

      fiery lava pit. And when he stands before massive castle gates, beyond which vile

      creatures concoct evil deeds, the player will acquire an awesome sense of scale, and of

      the overwhelming odds facing Corvus. Interestingly, players will not only see their

      interactions with the game, but also the game's interactions with Corvus...&quot;</font></p>

    casting offensive spells at each other in order to kill opponents and drain their power. A

    battle is over when one of the three teams has killed all the members of the opposing two

    teams, or when the match's timer runs out.</font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">So the gameplay is

      excellent, but what makes this game really stand out are its 3D graphics. They are simply

      phenomenal, and are easily the best-quality graphics yet seen in a role-playing game.

      There's a wide array of selectable characters ranging from warriors through elves to

      rodent-faced ratlings, all of which are beautifully rendered and animated. This quality

      extends throughout the game. There are super-realistic horses that characters can ride on

      and a veritable army of enemy characters, ranging from horribly realistic giant spiders

      and massive man-eating plants to beautiful, bare-breasted nymphs and hulking, ugly trolls.

      The backgrounds are also excellent, ranging from deep, dark forests to the more

      traditional dungeon-type environments</font></p>

      etc. So it is now possible ( through the scripting language ) to trigger off various

      animations, and I can get the characters to animate as they walk around the screen. </font></p>

      the final component of the demo; it is pretty much completed now and ready for release. I

      will be tweaking the animation code a little, and I need some animated graphics (hopefully

      Chris Pyle is working on them for me) but nothing major is left. I don't think I will

      release on Wednesday; it is 1st April after all, and I wouldn't want the demo to be

      carnage. The graphics have the same sort of high resolution 16 bit rendered overhead feel

      diverse co-op play options will allow for fast-paced multiplayer fun and challenging wars

      hosting a contest to name some of the beasties within. </font></p>
