    <p align="center"><img src="rtk-box.jpg" alt="UO:T2A" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="232"><br>

    <p align="left">You are Squire James (nee &quot;Jimmy the Hand&quot;), once a young thief
    rising rapidly through the ranks of the criminal &quot;mockers&quot;, now a member of
    Prince Arutha ConDoin's court in the capital city of Krondor. The game begins with Arutha
    sending you to greet the newest arrival to the court. The new court mage is arriving from
    Stardock, and you are to escort her through the sometimes dangerous streets of Krondor to
    the safety of the palace.</p>
    <p align="left">As much a tribute to R.E.F.'s input as anything else, the game is divided
    into chapters. Each chapter begins with an overview of what is going on overall in the
    game, as well as the specifics of the current chapter. This is delivered to you as a sort
    of journal entry or letter from Pug (or Milamber...I always thought Milamber was a better
    name for a sorcerer :) of Stardock, one of the most important individuals in Midkemia, but
    unfortunately only a narrator in this adventure.</p>
    <p align="left">Ok...off to find this new court mage...one Jazhara. Right away, the linear
    style of the game becomes apparent. Krondor is a big city, with many places to visit and
    houses to step into (usually filled with people who want to poke you with a variety of
    sharp objects), but aside from a few hints of trouble coming, there is really not much
    going on until you finally find Jazhara. (K, I might be a little bitter here...I went over
    the whole map twice before I noticed you could go right instead of left at a certain gate
    sector...so I had more than my fill of killing thugs by the time I found her.)</p>
    <p align="left">After wandering around a bit more, it's back to the palace...to be pointed
    to the next page in the story. This is something that will really depend on personal
    taste, but you can't help feeling that the whole game is just a matter of getting from A
    to B. Sure you can take a side trip to C along the way, but sooner or later, you will end
    up at B. The story is well written...and it's definitely an engrossing ride...but you
    can't help the feeling that you are never really in control. A chapter will always present
    you the same problems, and you have to progress through those problems to arrive at a
    specific end before you can continue on. As I say, this is a matter of preference, but I
    (and a lot of other rpg'ers) prefer something a little more open ended. The fact that you
    are stuck with premade characters doesn't help with the feeling you are more of a
    spectator than a participant in the over scheme of things...</p>
    <p align="left">Through the course of the game, you have 5 characters that you can control
    (only 4 in your party at once though). James, Jazhara, William ConDoin (the son of Pug),
    Kendaric (a journeyman in the Wrecker's Guild) and Solon, a warrior priest of the temple
    of Ishap. Each character has certain skills and stats when they first join your party,
    after which is it up to you to shape the growth of that character.</p>
