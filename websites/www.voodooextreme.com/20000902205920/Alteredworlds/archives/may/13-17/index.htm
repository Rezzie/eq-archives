      tweaked, classes tested, spells and balance, etc. during the last week while all were kept

      away... New weapons (light to expert) were added. I have found some of these weapons and

      am truly impressed -- they work beautifully! Some fantastic armor was added (see new

      manual), some class specific items were given to all classes (again, pictured in the

      manual) these class items are part of the homelands... along with hundreds of other

      items!! </small></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Well since there are so

      many posts, I thought I would post the new FAQ questions again so the newbies might

      actually see it before posting. ;) </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>FAQ </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>New - Is there going to

      be a Beta test group?<br>

      There won't be a Beta test for Fallout 2. RPG's in general don't lend well to Beta

      Testing. They are generally done for strategy or action games. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>New - When is the Demo

      going to be released?<br>

      Doing a demo would delay the shipping of Fallout 2 significantly, therefor we will not be

      doing one. Doing a demo for a complicated RPG isn't a simple process, it would delay

      Fallout 2 by many months. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>New - I hear you can

      pimp your spouse. Is this true?<br>

      Yes, this is a dark world. Since you can play either a good or evil character, there are a

      lot of &quot;bad&quot; things you can do. It's up to you to role play your character to

      the light or dark side. ; ) </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>New - If I attack one

      guard, will everyone on the map know immediately?<br>

      No, as mentioned. The AI is getting a very large improvement in many areas. Guards will

      now have chance of hearing another guards cry for help depending on where they are on the

      map and weather or not they are in a building. Line of sight and hearing are being

      expanded and improved. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>New - How much bigger is

      Fallout 2 going to be?<br>

      Fallout 2 has been advertised as being 50% bigger, but it is actually much bigger than

      that. There are many more quests, maps, NPCs, weapons, monsters, and all around things to

      do. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>New - Will Fallout 2

      have expansion packs or add-ons?<br>

      There are not any plans at this time, but we are making the modifications to the engine

      now, so that we will be able to in the future. This does not mean that we will be making

      expansions, it just gives us the ability if we want to.</small></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>I don't want to start a

      flame war, but I feel that I must answer your criticism in some way. To begin with, I must

      acknowledge a couple of things:<br>

      Certainly the game has been greatly delayed from the original release date we were aiming

      for last fall. Certainly the NID wasn't put out when we had hoped. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>But, bear with me while

      I try and answer your post: </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>First off, if you are

      unhappy with the way that the game has progressed, don't blame my team, blame me. I am

      directing the production of the game here at BioWare and if any promises were broken, it

      has been my fault. No one has lied about anything that I am aware of, however. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Second, we made a

      conscious decision many months ago that we were not going to cut features from our

      original design for the game, grand and over-ambitious though it was. Instead, we have

      committed to make the RPG that we have always wanted to play, and to take the time

      required to complete it and remove all known bugs, and balance it for as long as

      necessary. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Interplay has supported

      us in this decision and for this we are grateful. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Third, the NID has been

      delayed by Interplay because they were concerned that a lot of the video cards' DirectX

      drivers had problems under 16-bit and higher modes (few games have used these to this

      point). We are trying to resolve these problems so that as many people will be able to

      look at the NID as possible. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Finally, we are working

      hard to complete the game - my team is pouring their heart and souls into Baldur's Gate

      every day. It is the game that we have all always wanted to play. If you are unhappy with

      the game, return it. If you want to wait until a friend recommends it or a reviewer you

      trust likes it, please do so. But wait until the game is out - we think it will be a great

      game.</small></font></p>

      influence be strong enough to satisfy someone like me who is an rpg fan and not

      necessarily fond of strategy games? </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Answer:<br>

      It depends on what's important to you in an RPG. This game is not about skill sets, hit

      points, and experience levels. It is about NPCs, conversation, story, combat, etc. It's

      going to be a new genre. Personally, if you at least like action games a little, I think

      you'll definitely like WoT. </small></font></p>

      playing...that's where we're gonna focus the game. Role playing. That means that the game

      will not be hack and slash oriented. We want people to TRADE to make money. We want to see

      people building boats. We want to see people using their imaginations to make a

      difference. With the world being so expandable, and the engine so FREE, they should be

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Well I just finished

      some bug fixes with the NID and have sent it off to Interplay for more QA. Hopefully I

      won't see it on my desk tomorrow with &quot;just one more little problem&quot;. Since it

      should be out &quot;any time now&quot;, I thought that I would share some of my thoughts

      on the overall quality of the NID vs. the final game. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>The NID was mostly

      finished last september, but was delayed while we waited for, sounds, voice acting, and

      some other misc. stuff. The biggest delay was the voice acting. Since the sound studio and

      actors are hired on a daily basis, it didn't make any sense to rent the studio for the few

      sounds that the NID needed. As such, the NID had to wait until we were ready to record the

      voice acting for the main game, and for Interplay's sound guys to be free. After that, we

      had to make some minor changes, a graphic test, and send it through QA. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>I don't want to sound

      like I'm making excuses, but I don't want you to think that we've just been sitting on it

      for 7 months, while snickering &quot;hee hee, Let's make them wait just a little

      longer...&quot; We have been trying to get this out a fast as posible without slowing down

      the production of the real game. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>--------- </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Ok, enough rambling. The

      point I want to make is the NID is based on a 7 month old version of the engine and we

      have make a lot of improvements since then. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>In case you are curious,

      here is a list of some of the improvements that we have done in those 7 months.... </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>1. Character Animations:

      We have redone a lot of the character animations since then. The mages have better looking

      robes, and the kobolds and gibbering have redone animations. Overall, the animations are

      noticable better. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>2. Lightning: In the NID

      the lightning is drawn with line drawing routines. We have since replaced this with a

      nifty glow effect. If have seen the screen shot on bgchronicles, you will know what I am

      talking about. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>3. Rain: We have redone

      the rain since the NID. It looks more like real rain falling now. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>4. GUI's: The GUI's are

      still a work in progress. We are constantly updating the functionality and art. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>5. Spell Effects: We

      have redone almost all of the spell effects since the NID. We have added some really cool

      glows effects and have removed most of the pixel effects. We did keep the sparkle trail

      though. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>6. Sound Effects: While

      we have most of the voice acting, Interplay's sound wizards are still hard at work,

      tinkering with final game sounds. From the little that I have heard, the final sounds

      should be top notch. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>7. Voice acting: Yes the

      characters in the final game do say more than &quot;For the gloy of Helm!!&quot;. Just be

      thankful it's not the place holder sound that Ray had screeched into the mike. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>8. Music: While the

      music in the NID is really good, it's not the real music for Baldur's Gate. I have heard a

      rumor that it will be recorded by the Prauge Symphony Orchestra, but this is unconfirmed.

      Any guesses on where the NID music came from? </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Hmmm... it, looks like

      we have been tinkering with almost everthing since the NID was made. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>So I hope that you enjoy

      the NID, and keep in mind... If you liked the NID, the final game should blow you away. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Q: How is player

      killing going to be handled in middle-earth? </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>A: When creating your

      character, you will be allowed to specify if you want to partake in the adventures of

      player killing. If you choose no, you will be immune to attacks from other player killers.

      However, if you try to pick someone's pocket or perform some other anti-social act, your

      player killer switch will be turned on for you. If you later decide to change your ways

      and stop being a criminal, you can turn your player killer switch back off again after a

      few weeks of good behavior. There will be several &quot;newbie&quot; areas that are off

      limits for player killers and the like. </small></font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" color="#C0C0C0"><small>So it seems to me that everyone

    Since my experience with UO was less than pleasant with these fellows I feel this is a

    great idea and that something needed to be done about this. However i'm kind of interested

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Just curious, might

      Asheron's Call make an appearance at E3 this year? I know Jason's policy of &quot;no

      hyping&quot; but seeing that about 98% of the big upcoming games will be there and we did

      not see AC at the CGDC might it make an appearance? </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Yes, we'll be at

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>: Now, you may say that

      graphics do not matter, but EQ looks like to have a much greater variety of

      characters/classes, where AC will probably gravitate toward UO's Tank Mage principal,

      which would only be natural in a mainly skill-based system. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>I'm always

      amazed that people can so quickly jump to this conclusion without having any real knolege

      of our skill and magic systems.. </small></font></strong></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>: The one big minus to

      AC (besides graphics, and the skill system that is :), is that they will be housed on MS

      Game Zone. I can't imagine that sucker handling a large scale RPG such as AC IN ADDITION

      to all the current games. Once you throw in that one huge world, if they drop the ball on

      the network architecture, this sucker is going down. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Haha - AC's

      servers will not be the same ones that handle Hearts and such. AC has it's own dedicated

      servers, and server software which we (Turbine Games) have developed.. </small></font></strong></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>: I wish the best of

      luck to AC, and will definetely take a look once the public beta starts, but I remain

      sceptical of this game, especially considering that on every other question the answer

      from the dev. team was : &quot;Not in the initial release...&quot; . :) </small></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>The level design is such

      that there will be portions of quests that can only be completed by Rynn alone or that

      must be accomplished by Rynn and Arokh together. For example, Rynn may receive some form

      of quest that would direct her to a cave. The cave opening may be too small for Arokh to

      fit through, so Rynn will have to go on foot. If the cave should happen to open up at some

      point later in the level, Rynn will at times have the ability to summon Arokh to pick her

      up on the other side. Bear in mind that there don&#146;t appear to be distict levels. As

      far as the gamer is aware, it&#146;s all one enormous contiguous environment. </small></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <i><p align="left"></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>8. Can someone

      please explain how the multiplayer is going to work? I've seen so many different postings,

      I'm not sure if they all are correct or if they are all wrong. IP addresses, servers, etc.

      </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>This is a complex topic.

      Essentially, a player spawns a multiplayer game. This player is the &quot;leader,&quot;

      and he or she controls things like what is importable (stats, stats plus exp and levels,

      or stats, exp/levels, and items) by other players, what is visible to other players

      (inventory, character record sheets, etc.). Other players join in via a GameSpy-like

      interface (we may use GameSpy, actually), importing as many characters or creating as many

      characters as they have been assigned slots by the leader (i.e. players can be assigned

      more than one slot if the leader so desires). They then play through the same storyline as

      in the single player game, cooperatively. Hope this capsule summary helped!</small></font></p>
