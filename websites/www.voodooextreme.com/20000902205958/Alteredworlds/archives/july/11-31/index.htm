      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">Action! No, we are not
      creating an action game. When people saw &quot;action adventure,&quot; on some of our E3
      materials, this choice of wording left many with an unintended impression. We are creating
      a game with a high pace of play and constant tension element. What I mean by this is best
      described using Ultima Underworld as an example. One of my favorite features of Underworld
      was that sense of tension at all times. NPC and monster threats were closely interwoven.
      It took place in a dungeon after all. Right outside the door of where an NPC might have
      been located could lurk a monster, so you always had to be on your guard. In many
      &quot;lineage&quot; Ultimas (what I call Ultimas with a # after them), we have created
      sedentary towns surrounded by often gigantic, aimless wanders to get to the deep dark
      dungeon and back. In Ascension we are trying to weave the tension into all aspects of the
      game as we did in Underworld. Ultimately, we have created a world that has such strife
      within it, it is reasonable that monsters or at least bad guys might be right around the
      corner.</font></small><br>

    isn't RPG related but we're all gamers here and Sin is defenitely getting some major
    notice. I dloaded the demo and found it to be Quake. Yeah the graphics are a little
    cleaner etc but overall the engine is still relatively the same. Now that is simply the
    graphics...it's what's under the play that matters. The in-game cutscenes are sweet as all
    hell! I gotta say this gets me very antsy for Half life indeed! Overall this game should
    be money well spent and I look forward to seeing the full thing. I also picked up Grim
    Fandango which has superb visuals and excellently smooth gameplay. Even smoother than
    Monkey island 3! This game also looks very hot. I gotta say...things are getting very
    spicy in gaming land lately. Let's just hope they release these things on time?!! Sorry I
    can't get some news to ya yet...only have time for a few comments etc. Believe me, you'll

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff"><small>The mouse is the main
      interface device. There are also keyboard &quot;hot keys&quot; that can be assigned to
      whatever you want. Party members (other than your own character) are controled much the
      same way that the main character is. They have their action icons, can cast spells and
      find traps (if the class allows of course). They do, however, have personalities, which
      shine through at times. They dislike people (a thief and a paladin probably won't get
      along), have a morale (they can get scared and run away), and in a few instances go kinda
      nuts (there is a beserker that can join). You can override most things, except the above
      mentioned. </p>
      <p align="left">During game play, characters are highlighted with various colored circles.
      This is a list of what those different colors represent. </p>
      <p align="left">Red = enemy </p>
      <p align="left">green = party member </p>
      <p align="left">blue = neutral </p>
      <p align="left">yellow = panicked (failed morale) </p>
      <p align="left">If anyone is in shadows and commits a offensive action, he/she becomes
      visible. The ranger (or thief) can attempt to hide in shadows again, but chances are
      &quot;they know where you are&quot;. </p>
      <p align="left">If your main character dies, the game is over. You have to reload and try
      again. This is because of the story of the game. One of the main quests revolves around
      your main character. </p>
      <p align="left">Elves cannot be rescued using the Raise Dead spell, but they can be saved
      using the Resurrection spell. 5th level Raise Dead requires much of the corpse in
      reasonable condition, as it does not restore massive damage. The creature cannot have been
      dead for too long (varies on level of the caster). The raised creature permanently loses a
      point of constituion. 7th level Resurrection requires little more than a tooth, and raises
      the creature to perfect health. It ages the caster 3 years, and puts him out of action for
      a time depending on the level of the creature raised. Raise Dead is available, for a
      price, from various temples in the game. Resurrection is not. Sorry elves. </p>
      <p align="left">You cannot keep pets. You cannot ride any flying creatures. Not even
      horses and caravans. Perhaps in future chapters. </fonts></small></p>

      push to QA Baldur's Gate, and to fix the bugs that the QA process uncovers. We're
      finishing up the last few features that still need to be implemented - mostly secondary
      screens that need to be in the final game, but not for the QA process. We're also now on
      our second pass through the data. All of the data has been entered already but now we are
      going through it to ensure that it works (most of the time at least) before QA gets to try
      picking it apart. We finished the second pass on chapter four last week and are now on
      chapter five, which is similar in size to chapter three, one of the largest chapters in
      the game. QA is just behind us - they're now QAing chapter three and we get bug reports
      daily that we are busy fixing. We're also preparing the low violence version of the game,
      and also have recently sent off a new version of the dialogue for translation - all to try
      and ensure that we get a simultaneous release of the game world-wide. </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">Treasure on monsters
      will be determined randomly, within basic guidelines (their weapons and such). However,
      many of the items in the dungeons and other places are placed there purposely, especially
      the more powerful ones.</p>
      <p align="left">There are pre-set monsters and random encounters. All of these you see on
      the screen, so you can run if you want. There are also random encounters when you travel
      from area to area, or when you rest in an unsafe place.</p>
      <p align="left">The Bard's ability to counter magic musical attacks is not in the game but
      their ability to inspire with a &quot;battle song&quot; is. Also, Bards will be singing
      strictly a capella. There will be no instruments for Bards in Baldur's Gate, but there is
      a good chance they will be in the expansion pack. </p>
      <p align="left">Some abilities will be disabled while wearing equipment that is not
      useable by the class with those abilities. Items that are forbidden will not be able to be
      equipped at all. Items that deliver penalties will cause the appropriate skill buttons to
      become shaded. This goes for all of the classes. Mages cannot wear armor at all. They
      cannot equip it. Fighter-mages can wear armor but cannot cast spells while they are
      wearing it. Quickspell slots will be shaded to indicate that they are inactive while armor
      is being worn. The manual will explain the weapon and equipment restrictions but there
      will be in-game help as well. </p>
      <p align="left">You can gain experience by completing a chapter without loading the game
      because you died. Along with monster killing and quest completion, that is how your
      character advances in levels. You do not get experience for finding treasure unless it's
      part of a quest. </p>
      <p align="left">Characters will be able to be &quot;ported&quot; into single player from
      multiplayer and vice versa, but they will be stripped of their possessions. BioWare is
      currently working on this to ensure that game balance is maintained. </p>
      <p align="left">You cannot choose height and weight attributes for your characters. </p>
      <p align="left">Unarmed combat specialization is currently not in the game. However, it
      may be added in a future expansion. </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">Originally published as <i>Allods</i>
      by Buka Entertainment, the game is something of a hybrid real-time strategy/role-playing
      game. Teleported to a strange new world, the player chooses one of four character
      types&#151;fighter, archer, wizard, thief, or their equivalents&#151;and sets off on a
      series of missions. There are more than 30 of these branching quests, ranging from
      escorting people to curing plagues to wiping out various and sundry bad guys. Combat plays
      rather like <i>Warcraft II</i>, but with far fewer units and much more detail when the
      main characters are involved (ultimately, you can control several heroes as well as
      mundane troops). In town, you can shop for weapons, armor, magic and the like at
      well-stocked stores, upgrade your heroes' abilities through training and generally do
      other RPG-like things. Over time, the main characters can develop into powerhouses, and it
      would seem the missions get increasingly difficult as well.</font></small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">So what does Matt Norton
      think the biggest change in <i>Fallout 2</i> is? &quot;Technically, I think that the
      biggest single change to <i>Fallout 2</i> is the enhancement of the player's NPC party
      members. The player has much more control over the party in and out of combat, and NPCs in
      general behave more like real people than before. However, the biggest change that I've
      noticed is that the overall quality of the gameplay experience is higher in <i>Fallout 2</i>
      than in <i>Fallout</i>.&quot; </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff"><p align="left"><small>Baldur's Gate allows you
      to pause the game in order to give your party members commands as often as you like.
      However, there is no autopause feature implimented at this time. BioWare may consider
      adding this option if they find a need for it during QA testing. </p>
      <p align="left">Thieving is possible for thieves and other characters who possess the
      thievery skills (which includes picking pockets). A random item is selected from the
      hapless victim if you succeed. If you don't succeed, they may become hostile toward your
      character. </p>
      <p align="left">Your party can split up within an area, including building interiors,
      unless the building is large enough to be its own area, but there are only a few of those
      (dungeons, caverns and such). </p>
      <p align="left">If you walk away from the NPCs, they will just sit there patiently and
      wait for you. However, they will leave your party if their morale gets too low. </p>
      <p align="left">The primary music will be streaming audio that changes as you do different
      things, such as starting a battle or changing areas. </p>
      <p align="left">More RAM allows for more animations, backgrounds, and other vital program
      data to be kept in memory rather than having them cached to the hard drive. </small></font></p>
