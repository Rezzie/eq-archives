    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Well here we are, E3 is all finished and we
    are left with a ton of goodies from the convention. Let me set this up for you and I'll
    start at the beginning. First my Father pulled out his Plumping tools and used them to fix
    my Mother up....oh wait wrong story. Luckily I live only a few short hours drive away from
    Atlanta so we jump in the Altered Mobile and head on over. First thing I do is pick up my
    pass and hit the convention going in no particular direction since this place was huge.
    When you first walk in one of the Wings, you are totally assaulted by one
    thing......noise! And lots of it. Huge Flat screens hanging on walls showing new games,
    scantily clad women hanging around doing nothing but looking good, and the best
    part.....games everywhere. So without further ado let's see what we have here in no
    particular order:</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><em><font color="#FF00FF" face="Arial" size="3">Thief: The Dark
    Project: </font></em></strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
    I saw enough of this game to give an assumption that it should be good. However the AI
    seemed really bad. When the main character shot arrows at some of the swordsman they
    wouldn't really react and walk in some predetermined path. I didn't really get to talk to
    any of the programmers on it either. But the graphics looked clean and the idea seems very
    cool. It's all about Stealth and hiding in shadows etc. Overall once they kill these few
    bugs it should be a solid game. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><em><font color="#FF00FF" face="Arial" size="3">Revenant:</font></em></strong><font
    face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF"><br>
    </font><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">In the Eidos section, behind all the
    Tomb Raider 3 hoopla lurked Revenant. The graphics looked slick for a 2D game no doubt.
    They had a semi playable demo there which you could fight a creature or two and talk to an
    NPC mage. Combat was still in it's infancy but really seemed like it could be fun. Very
    authentic feeling when in battle with the creatures. Also movement needed much work
    considering your main character seemed to float across the floor at times. Also talking to
    NPC's wasn't so much of choosing dialogue but listening to them. However I only met the
    one Mage so I can't really comment too much on that. Hopefully they will have the
    corridors and environments filled with more nasties when this game hits the shelves later
    this year. But from what I saw it looked visually better than other games of this type and
    perspective with the exception of BG. However this game should be very nice when it's
    released.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><em><font color="#FF00FF" face="Arial" size="3">Diablo 2:</font></em></strong><font
    face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF"><br>
    </font><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">Probably the most disappointing game
    for me at the show. If you were a fan of the original then you'll love this. From what the
    programmer I talked to said, it will be more RPG like this time around which can only be a
    good thing. There is a run feature built in which was nice. And the Night affects were
    also well done especially with the new lighting. But overall this game is identical so far
    to the original except with outdoor scenes. When I first started to talk to the programmer
    he showed me around the charred remains of Tristram (SP?) which looked great. You could
    also run in and out of buildings too. The creatures had better death animations and combat
    was identical to the original. One thing this guy was vehement about was that Diablo 2
    wasn't just more of the same. So I assume there is a LOT of more development to go yet on
    this title. And I do mean a lot. I was hoping Diablo 2 would be a bigger change but from
    looking at it you couldn't tell the difference between it and Diablo. Again, it's still
    too early to say though since the Interface hasn't been worked on much yet etc. But this
    is Blizzard so we can almost expect it to be great.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><em><font color="#FF00FF" face="Arial" size="3">King's Quest: Mask
    of Eternity:</font></em></strong><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF"><br>
    </font><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Tahoma" size="2">I talked to one of the Programmers on
    this for a little while. And also saw Roberta Williams playing it the day after. Anyway,
    he showed me around and answered all the questions I had about it. The graphics were
    extremely clean and well done. It really had a nice animated look to it that wasn't too
    childish looking. This game will be much more action oriented this time around for sure. I
    asked him if he had played Unreal yet and he said of course. With that I asked if they
    would have any cinematic touches to the game similar to Unreal's. Of course he showed me
    quite a few and were they nice. There will be a lot of in-game cinematics as well as cut
    scenes. In one particular scene he killed a Skeleton King on top of a tower and it toppled
    over the side after a few words to the main character. Overall this game should be a
    definite winner. Especially since you can toss a rope up a wall and scale it up and down!
    Little touches like this make it an especially cool looking title. I have a strong feeling
    this will be the best of the King's Quest games for sure.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><em><font color="#FF00FF" face="Arial" size="3">Drakan:</font></em></strong><font
    face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF"><br>
    </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Oh yeah! This game literally rocks the house down. The
    music playing in the background was great and had an incredibly adventurous feel to it.
    Then you see the screens displaying Drakan being played by the programmers and you finally
    realize why 3D is here to stay. I talked to one of the programmers (Hans) about it and he
    actually let me play it a bit until I crashed his PC. ;) Anyway, the graphics in this game
    are nothing short of phenomenal. The combination of flying on the dragon's back and
    walking around fighting is exhilarating to say the least. The mountains in the background
    are textured extremely well, and when you see the running water leading into waterfalls
    you will not believe your eyes. This was the most believable experience of actually flying
    on the back of a Dragon you will ever have. The Dragons are absolutely amazing when
    breathing breath weapons. Fire is the most common, but I saw Ice also! Hans said that
    Lighting is going to be added also and will have reflective powers which searches down all
    live enemies and kills them. Multiplayer is already in and I saw 3 of the programmers hook
    up for deathmatch of sorts. If you consider flying on the back of a Dragon a deathmatch.
    One of the coolest affects that I saw was when you killed another Dragon....it would go
    into a sort of spasm in the air and take a dive into the ground. You could even follow it
    down by taking your own Dragon into a powerdive! This is one of those games that needs to
    be seen to be really believed. Hopefully we'll get our chance this year?! </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Alright, that will wrap up part one of E3. I
    just wanted to get a few of the RPG's out of the way before I dove into the biggies. In
    the next review of E3, I am going to go into a bit of depth on Everquest and Baldur's
    Gate. I will also talk on Ultima 9 and Asheron's Call which was one hell of a surprise for
    me! Needless to say I'm saving the best for last! I should have that up tomorrow! Keep
    your eyes peeled.</font></td>
