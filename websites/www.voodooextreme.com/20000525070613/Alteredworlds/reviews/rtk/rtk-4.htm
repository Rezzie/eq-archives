    </p>
    <p align="left">Combat is easily the game's strong point (which is good - you do a lot of
    it). Characters are beautifully rendered in full 3D, complete with the weapons and armor
    currently worn. Every blow and spell cast is also animated to perfection. Many battles
    have a variety of camera angles available, which makes it easy to see exactly where each
    character is in relation to each other.</p>
    <p align="left">If you are a hard core gamer, or just want to know what is going on behind
    the scenes, you can toggle damage displays for attacks, so you can see exactly how hard
    you are hitting with that new weapon or spell. This will also display the current effects
    of &quot;Fate&quot; on the battle - one side gains an extra attack, does more damage,
    recovers health etc. The statistics of characters and enemies are displayed as a circle
    under the player's character when it is their turn, or under enemies when targeted - a
    green circle when fully healed, red when close to death. For spellcasters, the current
    level of mana is also displayed here, as a shrinking blue ball inside the health circle.</p>
    <p align="left">Each turn of combat, the participants take turns exchanging blows,
    according to their Initiative skill and &quot;Fate&quot;. During a characters turn, they
    may attack an enemy (or enemies if the first target dies and the player still has
    additional blows left two swing), move, move and attack an enemy, cast a spell, search the
    ground, evaluate an enemy or enter their inventory. Since it doesn't use up your turn,
    evaluate (right-click) as much as possible during combat. Using an item in your inventory,
    on the other hand, uses up your entire turn (whether you drink one potion or use a wand).
    I wish they had modified this so you could at least use multiple healing potions. Minor
    complaint. </p>
    <p align="left">Now for the not so minor complaints. There is no way for characters to
    exchange items during combat, so if one character has all your healing potions (or
    whatever) they must enter inventory and drop that item, then the character that you want
    to receive the item must search the ground on their turn to pick up the item. Even worse,
    spellcasters cannot cast spells with a weapon equipped (no big deal so far). To get around
    having to go into your inventory screen and effectively loosing a turn, you can
    &quot;CTRL-S&quot; to drop your weapon and cast a spell. It sounds like a workable
    solution, but I can't remember how many times I lost a staff because I forgot to search
    the ground to pick it back up after combat.</p>
    <p align="left">Although the camera angles available during the game do add new levels of
    detail to combat, there are times when you will be unable to move or attack a specific
    area due to the current view. I also had a couple of battles where foes would die, and
    fall &quot;off screen&quot; where you can't search the bodies for loot. The line of sight
    for spells and archery could also use some work. You can find yourself trying to target
    someone in front of you, but the character between you and to the side will render them an
    invalid target. There also doesn't seem to be a limit on the range of bows (I liked this,
    but not terribly realistic :).</p>
    <p align="left">Spellcasting has an interesting option during combat (for mages anyway) -
    Quick cast or Slow cast. Spells that are slow cast don't take effect until the next turn
    of combat, but they always work. Quick cast spells take effect immediately, but they don't
    always work. It's a good idea, but sometimes it didn't seem to work as intended. With 100
    skill, I still failed quick casting 4 or 5 turns in a row on occasion. </p>
    <p align="left">On the other hand, there are some fights that you can't seem to loose.
    Once you reach the chapters where you are controlling William, you seem to run into a lot
    of battles where the conclusion is pre-determined, and you are just running through the
    motions.</p>
