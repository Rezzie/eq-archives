    </small></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#ff00ff"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the beginning,
      there were the One and the Void. Now the Void was formless and empty. And the One said,
      &quot;Let there be a Gate,&quot; and there was the First Gate.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The One looked through the First Gate and saw
      within a reflection of the Void. The One circled the gate but still saw nothing but empty
      Void. Curious, the One entered the gate, and the First Gate swallowed and consumed the
      One.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thus did the One create the heavens and the
      earths in his own image. For, when the Gate swallowed the One, the Void within the gate
      assumed his likeness, becoming the First World and its firmament.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">And upon the First World were born the Children
      of the One, whole and adult, as if they had always been. The Children gazed with wonder at
      the heavens and saw within the stars the form of the One.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In time, one of the Children, the Son of the
      Dawn, sought and found the First Gate and saw within the primordial Void from which the
      One had come. Frightened, he did not enter. However, the Son of the Dawn took a Sherd of
      the First Gate and brought it back to show the other Children.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Much they marveled at the fragment and the
      Exotic matter of which it was made. Wonder became jealousy, and the Children fought over
      the Sherd. Finally, the Son of the Dawn returned to the First Gate and brought back more
      sherds.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, this did not appease the Children, for
      they had found that from the sherds could be made new, albeit lesser, gates. The Children
      gazed curiously at these new gates as had the One before, and they poked and prodded at
      the reflections of the Void within. And the gates swallowed and consumed the prods, as the
      First Gate had consumed the One. And the Voids assumed the likeness of the prods, forming
      from their essence new heavens and new earths.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the Children entered their new worlds, to
      fill them and subdue them, to rule over the denizens of the seas and the birds in the
      heavens and over every living creature that moves on the lands. </font></small></font></p>

      gamers reading this review -- those who have experienced the PlayStation version and those
      who have not. To be honest, there is no compelling reason for console aficionados to
      purchase the PC version. Other than enhanced graphics, nothing is different. For PC
      devotees, this is an important release, despite innumerable technical problems. Nothing
      like it exists for the computer, and although its approach is dissimilar to traditional PC
      offerings, it is a genuine work of art. Hard-core purists might confer an upturned nose,
      but I would argue that gamers who recoil from more cumbersome RPGs will take to this game.
      The powerful emotional punch of the far-reaching narrative, the engaging character
      interaction, the fierce battles, and the promise of a fresh, magical experiece might prove
      alluring, and bring new gamers into the RPG fold. However, there will be those who, for
      good reason, turn from the game due to graphic anomalies, inferior sounds, and technical
      dilemmas. The overall score is based on the current state of the game, and for that
      reason, it falls short of greatness. The game has its brilliance, so the final verdict is
      up to Eidos and Square Soft. </font></small></p>

      From Black Isle Studios, the role-playing game (RPG) division of Interplay Productions
      (NASDAQ:IPLY) comes Mordor II </small><font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font><small>, which is
      in joint development with the Bellevue, Washington-based software company, VB Designs</small><font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font><small> and will be available for Windows® 95 CD-ROM for
      release in Winter 1998. This epic fantasy role-playing game provides for both
      single-player or an Internet-based multi-player experience.</p>
      <p align="left">The Mordor II gamer can run a Mordor server and be his/her own online or
      off-line &quot;dungeon master.&quot; The more robust the host server, the more gamers can
      join in. With this feature, RPG'ers can have access to the Mordor universe without the
      added expense of monthly online fees they have experienced with such games as Ultima
      Online. Additionally, Mordor II gives RPG'ers their first chance to have the use of the
      design and editing features action gamers have had access to for years with games like
      Doom</small><font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font><small> and Quake. Interplay and VB Designs
      also plan to release various game tools and editors that will allow consumers to create
      and customize their own role-playing game adventure. These will include a map generation
      tool, a quest scripting language, a monster editor and will even allow the player to
      change the art in the game. Mordor II will only be limited by the imagination of the
      gamer. </small></font></p>

      fantasy RPG being designed and produced by Bifrost Creations and set in the mysterious and
      volatile kingdom of Valikorae.</p>
      <p align="left">Avaris will be presented in a 1st person perspective 3D engine which will
      occasionally switch to a 3rd person perspective, dynamically moving camera to capture each
      scene in its most atmospheric light. </p>
      <p align="left">Bifrost is attempting to model behavior in a new and innovative way which
      should facilitate unfolding the story in a non-linear, non-scripted fashion through the
      computer controlled players. There are currently several people on the team and they are
      presently in the middle design stage. </p>
      <p align="left">Avaris will feature a full 3D engine. The engine will dynamically scale
      the complexity of models to maximize the graphics potential of your system. The game uses
      two display engines, one for open outdoor areas and a separate engine for towns and
      dungeons. Outdoor areas use full 3D heightmapping for a realistic looking landscape.
      Indoor areas are able to use complex objects for walls, floors and ceilings. The entire
      world is presented in full 3D meaning buildings with many floors and dungeon areas that
      can overlap one another.</small></font></p>

      have a Phase .5 of sorts, involving approximately 40 people, and this phase has been going
      on since right after E3. It's going great, and while that phase has been underway, we've
      been calling people about phase one, and sending out NDAs. We have well over 200 NDAs out
      now, and will be sending probably 100 or so more out for phase one. The plan is to have,
      as stated before, about 100 or so people online at any given time. Phase two will begin
      after we are happy with the way the game is progressing under phase one. With phase two,
      which will still be under NDA, we will increase the number of people such that we have
      approx. 500 people playing at any given time. People are still being called for phase one,
      but we're pretty close to having everyone for that phase. But our people will continue to
      call out for phase two, and like I said, there will be a lot more people. Phase 3 and
      beyond will probably not involve an NDA, but we aren't positive at this time. </small></font></p>

    review I've seen on the game so far (not of course including my own which should be up
    soon), and actually points out all the flaws and inconsistencies in the game.&nbsp; Nice
    work.&nbsp; Here's a sample. - <a href="mailto:rbowmaster@shaw.wave.ca">Bowmeister</a></small></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p align="left"></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Upon first boot,
      the most notable and obvious improvement this game has to offer is its graphics. For a
      non-3D accelerated CRPG, the graphics in MMVI are simply stunning. The rolling sky is
      gorgeously depicted and the game&#146;s entire myriad of environments ground you well
      within the world of Enroth. Granted if you run off and compare them to say, Unreal, they
      won&#146;t hold up as well, but as far as CRPGs go they look great. The only problem may
      be for users of slower systems. The 3D graphics of MMVI have three speed settings
      corresponding to the turn rate of your party. Rather than being able to gradually turn
      from side-to-side smoother than the &#145;Fonz, owners of dated systems will most
      definitely find themselves having to skip a lot of frames with every turn/step, leading to
      a somewhat choppy game world. Still, on my Pentium 166 (admittedly a rapidly aging beast),
      the skipping of frames was fairly negligible and, after a couple of hours of play,
      completely forgotten. </p>
      <p align="left">While not implemented as well as the graphics, the sound is also very
      solid and a definite improvement over the Xeen games preceding MMVI. The music does an
      effective job of setting mood and tone in most cases, and the clang of steel on steel and
      the hissing of a viscious cobra are at least reasonably convincing. The problem is the
      sound effects themselves get very repetitive. I mean, after hearing an Evil Spirit howl at
      me two hundred times, I get the gist. The following three billion times you get subjected
      to the exact same sound can get a little old. It&#146;s a minor complaint to be sure, but
      worthy of note to those of you who can&#146;t sit through TV commercials, even the good
      ones, more than two or three times (Doo-be-Doo-be-Doooooo).</small></font></p>
