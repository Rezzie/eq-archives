    is just the tip of the iceberg. This kind of stuff adds so much more life to the game,
    other than MP of course and the levels will defenitely get even better in the future.
    Anyway, the way it looks.....we won't be seeing Half Life for a little while yet, even
    though I just read at Blues that Half Life hasn't been delayed. But a project that big
    will almost defenitely get knocked back to the X mas season. As for RPG's....Bah! Hell,
    nearly everything we cover here has a release date of late 98 or 99. BG won't be here till
    Fall, as will Everquest and many of the others. Basically I guess we have to get used to a
    dead summer for software anyway. Oh well.....don't you worry though....we will keep the

    <blockquote>
      <i><p align="left"></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>You begin the
      game just outside of Tristram, the original town where you were in the original. Anyway,
      you aid a caravan that is being attacked by demons and hear the rumors of Diablo escaping,
      and so begins the game.</p>
      <p align="left">However, before beginning the game you must choose a character. But now
      there are 5 classes this time around, two magic users, two warriors, and one hybrid. The
      two magic goers are the Sorceress (duh) and the Necromancer. The hybrid is the Paladin,
      and the two warriors are the Barbarian and Amazon. &quot;The character classes are going
      to have a much greater degree of individuality and separation from each other.&quot;Says
      Bill Roper, a Producer, and Director of Third Party Development, at Blizzard. He goes on
      to say &quot;Learning skills and spells will be dependent on level, other skills, and
      statistics. Also, each class will have unique spells and skills that not only allow for
      differences between classes, but also within each class.</small></font></p>

    It's been a loooong time since we saw a good hard core Sci Fi flick and not just some

      news, Urquhart acknowledged that Interplay intends to develop Fallout 3. He said that
      Interplay considers Fallout to be one its major role-playing brands and that a third game
      is all but certain. He also confirmed that Fallout 3 will likely feature a 3D engine, not
      the series' existing 2D isometric engine. &quot;I'm a big proponent of making games
      3D,&quot; said Urquhart. &quot;If that's where the industry and games are going, that's
      what we need to do.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">In fact, Interplay already has a 3D engine in mind for Fallout 3.
      Interplay tentatively intends to use the first-person 3D engine that it has developed for
      Stonekeep 2. However, Urquhart stressed that the engine would be modified to suit Fallout
      3's planned three-quarter view. &quot;Fallout has a look and even if we do a 3D version
      we're not going to change it so much that it looks unfamiliar,&quot; Urquhart assured us.</small></font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <i><p align="left"></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small><b>Delekhan:</b>
      As this is a swords and sorcery type of game, what kinds of weapons, armour, magic spells,
      and artifacts can we expect? Can you give us an idea of the game's creatures, monsters,
      and NPCs (non-player characters)? What sort of monster AI (artificial intelligence) will
      gamers encounter?</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Stefan Nyul:</b> Cool ones. No really, there will be a wide range of
      melee weapons like the mighty two-handed sword, the double-bladed great axe (they all love
      it most) but also smaller ones like the classic broadsword, the clumsy club or the swift
      dagger. Of course bows and crossbows can be used too. But what you will really love is,
      that all weapons are displayed with their individual graphic regardless of what you do
      with it. Take the great axe from the floor, put it into your inventory, ready the weapon
      so that it can be seen on your back, draw the &quot;monster&quot; an hit them all. In
      every situation you will see YOUR axe and no dummy graphics.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Michael Hoge:</b> Don't forget the magic spells! We have got two
      completely different kinds of spells: The Magic and the Psionic Powers.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Stefan Nyul:</b> Monsters will be the central element of GOTHIC. You
      watch them doing games or talk with each other, you try to sneak by, you battle them, you
      will use them against each others (very popular among the team). Unfortunately for the
      player some monsters cooperate with each other or lure the unsuspecting player into
      ambushes. There have also been heard rumors that orcs pull levers while the clueless
      player is standing on top of a trap door just to laugh at him while he falls into the pit.
      They will be REALLY nasty.</small></font></p>

    get here, OSI did the final public posting of their new Ultima online Reputation system.
    &nbsp; My first thoughts - Town killing :)&nbsp; This looks like it will add new life to
    the game, and remove several of the problems that have most plagued people with the old
    Notoreity system (mainly Player-killing).&nbsp; I'll keep you updated over the next week
    as Origin slips another couple of patches out to fine tune the new system. - <a href="mailto:rbowmaster@shaw.wave.ca">Bowmeister</a></font></small></p>
