    <p align="right"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">by <a href="mailto:kairn@voodooextreme.com">Kairn</a>

    (April 2, 1998)</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Before you is an extensive interview with Ben

    Cooley of Cinematix Studios Inc. The company that is bringing you the amazingly attractive

    RPG Revenant. <a href="mailto:kairn@voodooextreme.com">Kairn</a> had a chance to sit down

    and chit chat with Ben about various things..... and on with the show!</font></p>

    <hr width="75%" size="1" color="#D700D7">

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: Let's do what all interviews do... who

    are you and what is your role on the Revenant project?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: My name is Ben Cooley,

    and I'm co-designer and core system programmer for Revenant. I also oversee the artwork,

    and have taken on a lot of the production responsiblities.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn:&nbsp; Currently what is the status of

    Revenant at this time? 25%, 50%, 75%?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Between 50% and 75%.

    About 50% of the artwork has been completed. The system is about 80% done, and the

    gameplay and performance seems to be working fairly well, though we are still making

    changes to control and animations. The level design, dialog, traps, scripting and spell

    effects are about 25% done right now.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn:&nbsp; Early on in production was

    Revenant originally going to be called Forsaken: Thrall of Chaos? If so, what caused the

    change in name? If not, forgive me for this stupid question!</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Akklaim. Forsaken was

    trademarked by them during the period when we were developing the game. For a short time

    while we were trying to come up with another title, EIDOS used the interim name

    &quot;Thrall of Chaos&quot;, which incidently fits with the storyline quite well. Shortly

    after that we came up with &quot;Revenant&quot;, which fit our original story perfectly,

    and was a killer name to boot.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: What was the inspiration for Revenant?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Moorcock's Elric series.

    I don't really think there's been a succesful fantasy RPG with that dark fantasy mood to

    it. It's not really demonic, like Diablo, nor is it the knight in shining armor type of

    fantasy like Tolkien or Ultima.<br>

    <br>

    As for the game design, we owe a little bit to Diablo in the sense that they established

    (or more correctly ressurected) the idea of an easy to<br>

    get into RPG. Compare the amount of time needed to get into playing<br>

    Diablo to any of the Ultima series and you'll understand what I mean. <br>

    Certainly fighting games such as Bushido Blade, Tekken, and Toshinden for the realtime

    elements, and of course Ultima, every one of which I've played (well, okay, except for

    five).</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: How big is the world in Revenant? Will

    it be small similar to Diablo or huge like Ultima Online?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Pretty much a cross

    between. Revenant is based on a single island, with a mountain range dividing the two

    sides. The island itself takes about 5-10 minutes to traverse from top to bottom, yet it

    is not continental sized like Ultima Online. Of course, there are five main play areas in

    Revenant, including the town, western island, mountain caverns, eastern island and temple,

    the catacombs, and a wierd labyrinth type thing at the end. Each area has approximately

    five or so levels or main areas, with specific monsters, puzzles, and gamplay. There is no

    area of the game where all you do is simply kill monsters and collect items.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: With Eidos asking to add internet

    support have you had to change the story or background any to support this multiplayer

    aspect?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: No. We decided at the

    beginning to lock the player character to a specific character with a specific name. This

    player character has an<br>

    attitude and a personality that comes out in the dialog and events in the game. <br>

    <br>

    When we agreed to do multiplayer, we decided to retain this concept, but add additional

    characters with equally strong personalities, but with differing strengths and abilities.

    The original character system never had 'classes', but used differing character stats for

    specialization<br>

    (similar to Ultima Online). It was simply just a matter of rebalancing the stats for the

    multiplayer characters to give them dramatic advantages in different areas (i.e.

    spellcasting, combat, or stealth) to provide a completely different play for these new

    characters. The main character, Locke, is evenly balanced in all areas to allow the game

    to be played single player.<br>

    <br>

    We have decided to allow the multiplayer game to be played in two modes. The first is

    group play mode, where the players can play through the main game together as a team. The

    second is dugeon hack mode, where the players can directly enter dungeon levels and play

    as a team or do deathmatch. We haven't decided yet whether to create special levels

    specifically for the dungeon hack mode, though we are leaning towards this.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: How will the internet play work, will

    you or Eidos setup a dedicated server similar to Battle.net, so that players may join in

    on any game at any time.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: At this point, we are

    looking into using Mpath. We will see.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: Do you expect to address the problem

    of PK'rs with on-line games? If so, what type of plus' or minus' will you incorporate to

    help soothe those big, ass sores... err, I mean players?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Multiplayer games will

    be togglable between 'deathmatch' mode and 'group play' mode, where player killing is not

    allowed.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: Who are the characters? And how many

    are there?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: There are quite a few

    characters in the game. The main character is Locke D'Averam, he is a Revenant, a

    ressurected warrior from an earlier age who initially remembers little of his past. The

    muliplayer characters include Bayne Ironhand, an older veteran and an exile from<br>

    his homeland, Navarro, a shaman from the East who is generally regarded as a charlatan,

    and a woman who calls herself Morganna, rumored to be an assasin and a poisoner.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: As far as weapons go, what types of

    weapons will we see? How many are in the game?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: There's about 25. They

    fall into five main catagories, which determine the 3D animation the character uses when

    wielding them. They are swords, bludgeoning/mace, axe, bow/crossbow, and knife/dagger.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: Can we expect to see NPC's walking and

    talking in Revenant? What will their roles be in the game?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Ohhh yes. Because of the

    realtime 3D characters, and our motion capture system, we have exploited this to a degree

    people have never seen before. Expect to see monster guards sleeping on the job,

    townspeople playing cards at the tavern, monsters arguing in the dungeon, and a little

    Drugh (orcish dude) who'll give you a 'whippin' for 50 gold.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: Now, what type of enemies will we most

    likely run into? Could you give a list and maybe a short description for each? If they

    aren't classified of course.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: There are about 25

    different monsters I think, and they include Dragons, Orc like creatures, Stone Giants,

    Skeletons, Undead, Wraiths, and.. oh.. I can't quite remember all of them. Many of the

    creatures are unique to Revenant, and defy easy description (like the Gob).</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: How will combat be handled? Will the

    player have any control over how the battle is fought, weapon wise? Like for instance

    jabbing, slicing, or cutting with a sword. Or will it be point and click, ala Diablo?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Combat will be

    dramatically different from any RPG anyone has ever seen. When we decided to do Revenant,

    we wanted to exploit the power of realtime characters. This meant we wanted to do really

    cool combat, similar to the type of animation and effects you see in fighting games.

    &nbsp; The ground rules we decided on were:</font></p>

    <ol style="color: rgb(255,0,255); font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 10pt">

      <li><p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">The combat has to remain

        stat based, and NOT twitch based, though good tactics should make a big difference</font></p>

      </li>

      <li><p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">The combat had to be EASY

        to do, and not require any complex combos, moves, etc. </font></p>

      </li>

      <li><p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">It should be fast paced,

        and give you the feeling that you're really kicking some ass, instead of just

        'hack-hack-hack'ing.</font></p>

      </li>

    </ol>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">What we've come up with is a

    combat system where you can choose from 4 initial moves, which grows to 12 moves by the

    end of the game. Blocks can be manually activated, but usually are automatically activated

    based on the characters or monsters experience. Each attack move has its own advantages

    and disadvantages, and its effect is modified by the particular monster you are attacking,

    and the weapon you are using.&nbsp; Each attack has a vulnerability to a monster counter

    attack, has a possibility to hit, a damage value applied when a hit occurs, and a stun

    value which affects the monsters recovery from that attack. For example, overhand or

    leaping attacks can do a great deal of damage, but are more vulnerable to monster blocks

    or countermoves. <br>

    <br>

    All monsters have very specific weakness and attack patterns, (which can sometimes be

    quite complex). Once the player learns these weaknesses, he can exploit them to greatly

    increase his success when attacking these monsters (similar to the way Wing Commander I

    had combat tricks for the various Kilrathi fighters). In all cases, if there is a dramatic

    difference in strength between the character and the montster, the combat will be fairly

    simple, with one or the other being taken out almost immediately.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: Now with the magic system, how does

    one acquire magic? Will it use Tomes, scrolls etc...?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: The magic system is

    based on small jeweled talismans, that the character finds as he plays the game. These

    talismans, when arranged in the proper order, form the spells. The player can also use

    special talismans called power or effect talismans which will change the distribution,

    power, and visuals of a spell. In this way, some spells the character uses at the

    beginning of the game can get quite impressive and cool by the end, and the character

    never has to use just 'the latest and most powerful' spell.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: Ok now let's get to the engine,

    Revenant is using a true 3D engine, correct? Is everything in the game 3D based, like say

    pillars that are sitting in the middle of a room, are those sprites or polygons?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Revenant uses a

    combination of 2D tile backgrounds and realtime 3D characters, puzzles, traps, doors, and

    other moving elements. The tile background uses zbuffering to allow the tiles to be placed

    anywhere on the map in 3D space, and to intersect with eachother. In addition to the 2D

    z-buffered tiles, the system supports both static and moving colored lights which are

    pixel accurate on the backgrounds (not tile accurate like Diablo).</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: With characters being polygon based,

    what is the max polygon count on the characters? Will the characters have true physics

    applied? Meaning say, you're fighting another knight and he knocks you, say, on your chest

    plate with his sword, have you implemented true physics where you can be knocked on your

    tookus?(sp?)</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: All characters are

    realtime, though its nice that at the size they are on the screen they look just like

    sprites. The physics engine supports gravity and bouncing, though the character has to be

    specifically animated to look like he's falling down. There is also multiple levels to any

    given game map, with stairs, etc. though they are actually 2D and therefore won't support

    bridges or overhangs.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: Are you going to have support for the

    OpenGL API? And are you going to have support for 3D Card Accelerators?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: 3D accelerators.. yes

    absolutely. Though the game will run without acceleration, DirectX 5.0 does not currently

    support alpha textures in software, which will mean that most of our spell effects will

    not look very good in software. This is being changed in DirectX 6.0 however, and so

    software should be an option at that point. Most 3D accelerators right now are somewhat

    faster than software, though with the polygon sizes we use, we do not get a great deal of

    acceleration because of the higher polygon fill rate of many cards. I don't see us doing

    an OpenGL version right now, as DirectX seems to have more hardware support, though I

    wouldn't count it out.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: How is the Revenant engine handling

    lighting? Will it be pre-rendered or will it be real-time lighting, with shadows etc..?

    Also, it looks as though you have added the ability to have colored lighting in the game,

    is this true? If so, is it going to be 3D card based or software based?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Yes, lighting is handled

    both in the realtime characters and 3D objects, and also on the 2D background tiles. The

    lighting is pixel accurate, and uses a high speed algorithm we developed to allow for real

    time colored lights for both moving and stationary lights. Moving lights are a special

    case, and limited to one or two on the screen at the same time.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: What do you think some of the

    outstanding qualities in Revenant are? What do you think will make it standout from some

    of the other RPG's coming out the near future, like Baldur's Gate, Diablo II, Ultima IX?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: We are not doing a big

    drawn out complex story, a dungeon-hack equipment-fighting game, and we will not have long

    dialog trees, scavenger hunt style gameplay, and a huge game world. What we are doing is

    fast paced non-twitch realtime play, massive quantities of motion captured animation that

    allow you to really 'control' your character instead of just pacing him around a map,

    spectacularly atmospheric art and lighting with lots of different tile sets, lifelike

    characters and monsters and cool NPC interaction, diabolical traps and puzzles, and some

    really pretty music. One of the things that makes the game reallyunique is the terrific

    concept art we've used to set the tone of the game, which we owe to the work of Den

    Beauvais and Jae Kim, as well as the talented people on our own staff. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: Ok.. and now last but not least, what

    do you see in the future for Revenant? Do you plan on a Revenant II?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Well, we'll have to see

    how everything comes out. Of course I'd like to do another Revenant, and expand upon the

    world we designed for the first game with more cities, a complex storyline, and expanded

    technology and gameplay. Of course that's pretty far into the future right now, and we're

    just busy trying to put everything together for this first version.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kairn: I want to thank you very much Ben, and

    we can't wait to see the final product!</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Ben: Hey, it was fun. Hope

    you've got everything you need. </font></p>
