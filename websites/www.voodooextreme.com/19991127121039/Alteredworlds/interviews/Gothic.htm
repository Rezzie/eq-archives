    </strong><small><small>By </small><a href="mailto:unitedrealms@cwix.com">MadBard</a><br>
    With: Tom Putzki, Stephan Nyul, Micheal Hoge, and Alex Bruggemann<br>
    </small></em></p>
    <p align="left"><small><em>In the dark corners of your mind lurks terrors and adventures
    you never knew existed. Deep down in those </em>recesses<em> is where the guys from
    Piranha-Bytes are looking to dig in. They want to bring out that excitement and place you
    in their world filled with Fighters, Magic users, and everything else in the book of
    Fantasy. Except this time with a twist....you are stuck in Jail with all of them and no
    way out. Welcome to your new Hell....Welcome to Gothic.</em></small></p>

    <p>- Stefan Nyul, Project Leader<br>
    - Alex Brüggemann, Animations<br>
    - Michael Hoge, GameDesign/2D-Artist<br>
    - Tom Putzki, 3D-Artist/Marketing</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Tell us a little about Piranha Bytes the company?
    And what are your is your background in computer gaming and RPGs?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stefan: </font>Hi there! We always wanted to do great computer
    games but great games have to be international games and most of our team members
    previously worked for a German developer on titles for the German market. To achieve our
    goal, we had to found a new label and so PIRANHA BYTES was born. <br>
    So there we are, working on a really great title, having much fun with that and somtimes
    forgetting, we are living creatures that also need some sleep :-)<br>
    Tom: And food, and spare time and so on...it's time to put the armor on, take my 2handed
    sword with jagged blade and go to the woods looking for some trouble...time for the next
    LARP ;-)</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>The story around Gothic is an original that is
    centered around being jailed in a huge prison that is magically cut off from the outside
    world. What gave you the idea for such an interesting concept?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Michael:</font> First, we wanted to create a Fantasy-scenario
    that was dark and hostile (and no colorful fairy-tale-adventure). A Prison full of
    cutthroats seemed rather appropriate. Secondly, we needed to limit the size of the world,
    therefore we planned to place the prison on an island, but then we decided in favor of the
    magic barrier, because it emphasizes the feeling of being imprisoned. Our goal to create a
    real, living world would have never been achieved if we would have had to display too many
    characters - in GOTHIC, therefore there are &quot;only&quot; over 200 NPCs, each of them
    with his/her own character, behaviour, name, skills, friends, background story and more.
    So, come to think of it, 200 NPCs aren't THAT inconsiderable :)</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard:</font> The idea of actually seeing the improvements of a
    character's skills such as sword fighting played rather then just having<br>
    a slight number increase is something that will appeal to many gamers. Could you tell us a
    little about that?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Alex:</font> I think it adds a lot to a games atmosphere to
    visualize as many aspects as possible. If you improve your skills in sword fighting you
    will actually see the difference while fighting. You don't have to switch to a
    character-screen showing you some increasing numbers. All that stuff that you know from
    the more &quot;classic&quot; RPGs.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>What kind of social structure will there be in
    Gothic? Will there relationships between characters? And how do your<br>
    actions affect the world around you?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Michael:</font> In fact, social structure is the most important
    innovation compared to former RPGs. If you, for example, attack someone, and there is
    another person witnessing the fight, it depends on this person's attitude towards you,
    towards your opponent and how he judges his odds in battle. If you steal something not
    only the owner will notice that but also his friends will. There is a lot to say about NPC
    reactions, but I'm afraid for details you'll have to wait for the first demo. </p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>How is the artificial intelligence in Gothic? Do
    the monster do more then just attack and flee?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Tom:</font> Yeah, they really do. They have also relations
    between each other, some even interact with other races like the good old Troll throwing
    little Gobbos over a canyon towards the Player; they hunt each other, they even play with
    each other...they live their own lives with their own problems and the Player is just
    another creature disturbing their circles...</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>The screen shots that you have released are very
    impressive. Tell us about the 3D engine your using to make Gothic. <br>
    And what type of 3D hardware will Gothic support?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Tom:</font> The engine is developed by our programmers and will
    be on top of the genre..but please remember: we're not going to make a 3D shooter. We're
    using Glide for supporting Voodoo cards, all other 3D accelerators will be supported by
    using Direct 3D.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>What type of sounds can gamers expect in Gothic?
    Also how do you view 3D sound along gaming lines?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Michael:</font> 3D sound offers you the possibility to recognize
    at once from which side an unseen attacker is approaching. Whoever played
    Quake-style-deathmatch will find this vital. Moreover, it is a great step towards drawing
    the player into the game, therefore we're working at 3D sound for GOTHIC. </p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>One aspect of gaming that is always on the minds
    of our readers is mulitiplayer? How does multiplayer work in Gothic,<br>
    and over what platforms can Gothic be played in multiplayer mode?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stefan: </font>We figured out a very smart design for the
    multiplayer mode. This will be something absolutely unique, never done before. But let us
    finish the implementation before talking of details.<br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Tom:</font> What can be said right now is the fact that GOTHIC can
    be played in a local network with up to five players. And about this unique feature I want
    to say...<br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Stefan:</font> TOM !<br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Tom:</font> But Stefan, I just wanted to...<br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Stefan:</font> TOOOOM !!!<br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Tom:</font> Sorry about that, guys. Maybe next time ;-)</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>It has been rumored that there will be no
    character statistic screens in Gothic. First, is this true? And second what<br>
    made you decide to approach an RPG title in this way?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Michael:</font> In GOTHIC we have strength, dexterity, mana,
    psi-power and of course hitpoints. These can of course be reviewed in some kind of
    &quot;character screen&quot;, but it won't hardly be necessary, because everytime one of
    these attributes becomes relevant it will be displayed on the screen. In addition, we have
    many skills to learn, each of them visualized with a new animation. So the basic concepts
    of RPG remain unchanged while they were converted in something we consider more popular
    and more pleasing. Still, no one should be worried about losing game depth. There will be
    a multitude of quests and riddles and those 200 guys talking to you...</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>What type of combat system is there in Gothic?
    Will the action take place in real time or is it turn based?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Michael: </font>Its real-time, but with one important difference:
    The combat system primary bases on the characters skills, not the players capabilities.<br>
    That means if your character has the defensive power to block a monster, he WILL block it,
    no matter how clumsy you are. We still prefer the real-time combat, because you simply
    have quick fun and can engage opponents or quit a fight whenever you want. </p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>How does magic work in Gothic? Will there be lots
    of spells or will Gothic be more of a fighters game?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Tom:</font> We have two different kinds of magic: The 'common'
    magic system with fireballs and lightnings and stuff like that for the players who wants
    to be a classical mage, and the psionic magic system with more mental spells like the
    human control spell, with which the psi mage can control other human and human like
    characters. But our mages know also to handle a sword, and our warrior is able to use a
    simple healing spell as well.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>How does character generation work? Is it the
    traditional &quot;pick a class and hope it works out&quot; or do you have<br>
    something different in mind?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Michael: </font>Indeed. The first hours of playing will be your
    character generation. You will be able to learn the possibilities of GOTHIC before you
    decide wihich class to pick or which skills to learn. Everyone starts the game with the
    same attributes, only during the course of the game you will change your outfit,
    equipment, skills and you may even find your way of talking a bit influenced by the ones
    you spend most of the time with ;)</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Will there money in Gothic? If so will there be
    places to purchase items?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Michael: </font>No. In the prison, the only items worth something
    are the ore (this would be too much to explain now, if you are interested in story details
    please visit our homepage), weapons, food and stuff like that. You may exchange items with
    other prisoners or ask others to &quot;acquire&quot; certain things for you :)<br>
    Tom: Of course other prisoners are highly interested in things you've got ;)</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Do characters need to eat in Gothic?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Michael:</font> No. But you can eat to regain small amounts of
    Hitpoints.<br>
    Tom: What's so much fun about eating an apple?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Will players be able to save the game anywhere in
    Gothic?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stefan: </font>Yes, of course. In our opinion total freedom of
    movement also implies saving anywhere in the world. If you would have to run to some
    savepoint before finishing this would be no fun. And having fun is the &quot;prime
    directive&quot;.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Give some examples of the types of skills a
    character can learn in Gothic?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Tom:</font> As an example: For the warrior's way fighting skills
    are most important. Wether you prefer 1handed or 2handed weapons, sword or axe, melee or
    distance combat, bow or crossbow...everything can be learned, and each skill can be
    upgraded, visualised by better, cooler and faster animations, more damage and faster
    attack.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>What type of machine will I need to run Gothic?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stefan: </font>We try to keep the minimum configuration as low as
    a Pentium I 200. Although you will need to have a 3D-Graphics-Accelarator. But we support
    Direct 3D so it's not important which type of card you actually have.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Is there a DVD version of Gothic planned?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Alex:</font> We don't rely on lots of pre-rendered,
    non-interactive, video-scenes. So it doesn't make too much sense to do a special DVD
    version. </p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>I know it's still early in development but what
    percentage of Gothic is completed so far?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stefan: </font>There is still lots of work to be done. We have
    implemented most of the features but not too much of game data. So this quesiton is very
    difficult to answer because there is always the question &quot;percentage of what?&quot;
    Overall, I would say we have completed 40% of the game. </p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Is there anything else you want our readers to
    know about Gothic?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stefan: </font>Yes, of course. Visit our website to keep
    informed. We constantly update it and there are often some new diary entries. But don't
    take them too serious :-)<br>
    If you have any suggestions, you can find an email address on our website too. Let us
    know, what you think about our game.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Mike:</font> I think it's most important that any of you reading
    this writes his honest opinion about what we plan to do. We don't want to create a game
    for our own amusement - we want to give the players around the world a game worth its
    while - and to finally go one step beyond dozens of boring shooters and
    command&amp;conquer clones! <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Tom: </font>That's it. Drop us a line, tell us your suggestions and
    have a good time!<br>
    <br>
