        was just wondering, will Tel'aran'rhiod (World of Dreams) play a part in the game? It

        would make for some interesting game play... he he... also i was wondering if the Black

        Ajah (Aes Sedai serving the Dark One) would be present in the game? that would really

        complicate matters.... where will the Hound's fortress be located? Shadar Logoth? will

        there be angreal and sa'angreal available in the game? i know these are alot of questions

        so answer them at your discretion Glen... ;)<br>

        <br>

        <strong>1) Unless I make Tel'aran'rhiod an effect rather than an integral part of the

        story, it's going to have to wait until a future release. It's got great potential, and I

        really want to use it, but I can only build so much into the initial game.<br>

        <br>

        2) Yes, the Black Ajah are here in spades. :)<br>

        <br>

        3) The Hound's fortress is indeed in Shadar Logoth.<br>

        <br>

        4) Angreal? Maybe. Think Ter'angreal.</strong></small></font><font color="#004080"><br>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>&quot;I worked on Diablo

      in my mind for five years before working on it.&quot; But you can hardly get Brevik to

      talk about DI. Almost as soon as Diablo was wrapped, Brevik says he and the Blizzard team

      started thinking of what they could do to make it better - what they would do if they had

      a second chance. Namely, just the things gamers are going to see in Diablo II. <br>

      <br>

      &quot;There's an urge to implement all the things you learned along the way with Diablo I

      into Diablo II,&quot; says one of the designers. At the end of DI, the finished product

      was &quot;hyper-analyzed,&quot; said another designer. &quot;You see so many little flaws

      you almost can't stand it anymore.... You have to do it right the next time.&quot; </small></font></p>

      <i><p align="left"></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>To answer your

      thoughts on us completely re-writing the engine, we are definitely not doing that. There

      are two parts of code that will be re-written, but a vast majority is not being touched.

      Those two parts are: </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>1) The World Map code

      was pretty horrible and didn't allow areas to be dynamically added. So we decided to

      re-write it, which was completed about three months ago. This also might allow us to make

      small expansion packs that we offer on the web. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>2) Combat AI for Party

      Members and NPC's. Most people that played Fallout would probably vote to have this at

      least looked at and because we are giving the player more control over NPC's we've decided

      to re-write it. This has not started yet, but will be within the next few weeks. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Other than that, the

      kind of stuff we are doing is tweaking and balancing algorithms that really needed it, but

      that we didn't get to at the end of Fallout. Also we are updating some of the interfaces

      to be more usable, and adding some more script commands to make the scripters lives

      easier. </small></font></p>

Here's alittle

    bannana morsel for you chimps out there:</font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Many of the spells

      from the original Heretic are back including the Morph Ovum (so everyone can turn each

      other into chickens again!), plus several new spells like the Sphere of Annihilation, the

      Ring of Repulsion, and Fire Wall. There are eight offensive weapons in total and four

      defensive weapons, most of which are spell-based, but there is also melee, a magical bow

      and a magic staff. Players will use these weapons against dozens of creatures and humanoid

      races that act intelligently and work together, we're told. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">The twenty-five

      single-player missions take place in true 3D environments across very different kinds of

      locales such as cities, swamps, canyons, and caves. Since the Quake II engine is employed,

      there's also 16-bit color with colored lighting, but by using a third-person perspective,

      there are extra fluid character animations like diving rolls, hand springs, climbs, and

      other maneuvers that just aren't possible in first-person perspective games. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">For multiplayer

      gaming, Heretic II will support anything Quake II supports, i.e. Internet play, serial

      hook up, and local IPX network. Both deathmatch and cooperative multiplayer modes are

      planned, as well. Deathmatch will have several user configurable options (a la Quake II)

      like a level timer, kill counters, and the like and will support up to 16 players. Raven

      is hoping to get this mode up and running soon, so that they can iron out any potential

      issues of third-person perspective deathmatch. The cooperative game is limited to four

      players, due to the number of animations each player model has. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>I'm the project leader

      of LMK, and Tom just told me that you're putting up some information on LMK on your

      homepage. Just to make sure that no false rumors are spread, here are some facts on the

      game: </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>LMK stands for &quot;The

      Lady, The Mage and The Knight&quot;. It establishes a new brand, and has nothing to do

      with Realms of Arkania. The name Realms of Arkania is owned by Sirtech. However, the

      universe which you found in startrail,shadows over riva and blade of destiny was based on

      a system called &quot;Das Schwarze Auge&quot;(DSA), which is hugely popular in germany. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>The firm who owns Das

      Schwarze auge is involved in the storyboarding of LMK, and LMK takes place in the DSA

      world but at another time than the original DSA games. The time is 400 years earlier

      during a period called &quot;The MageWars&quot; </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>The screenshots which

      you are seeing are not the final look of the game, so while they already look pretty good,

      expect better to come. Much better. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>LMK has a multiplayer

      feature, but we are very stifflipped about it. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>There are many reasons

      for this, including one reason which is that we are trying something out which has not

      been done before, and we want to make sure that it stays this way until LMK is close to

      release for several reasons. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Both single player and

      multi player versions of the game feature a rich AI and high amount of object interaction.

      Yes, with us you can move every fork, if you want to. There's multiple things you can do

      with objects, and though some of them make no sense at all, we implemented it anyway, just

      for that additional feeling of &quot;I can if I want to&quot; </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>While instances of the

      AI have appeared in the magazines, those are but examples. We are trying to implement the

      npcs in such a way that the player will be able to believe in them. Details will be

      forthcoming on www.lmkworld.com as we get closer to release date. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>The amount of stats in

      is designed to show how some of the game mechanics work. You can't control anything, but

      every time you run it it will be slightly different - because the combat and movement

      shown uses the game engine to calculate combat results/locations. We unfortunately can't

      show much of the story in such a short demo either (unfortunately) - so a lot of the demo

      is short cuts from one location to another showing off some spells, combat, and some

      dialogue between players. NOT a series of screen shots. Rather, a series of &quot;in game

      cut scenes&quot; that show off the engine - or rather, a dated version thereof. Remember

      that the content for this is largely 6 months old now (though we have updated some of the

      art) - the stuff we are working on for the final game actually looks much better. Still,

      I'm reasonably happy with the way the NID looks - you should get a good feel for how the

      game will look after you see it.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Why not just show a

      movie, you ask? Well, good question. I really don't know, but after having&nbsp; seen the

      NID for about the hundredth time myself (the only person here who can possible claim to

      have seen it more than me is Scott, my lead programmer) I think the best part of it is

      seeing how many gibberlings the fighter can kill before...well, that would be giving it
