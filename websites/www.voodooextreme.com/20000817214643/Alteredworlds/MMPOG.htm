      <p align="center"><em><strong><font color="#C1C1FF">MMORPGs to go the way
      of the RTS?</font><br>
      </strong><small>by: <a href="mailto:spleen@mts.net">Certis</a></small></em></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">One minute you're looking at three games:
      Everquest, Asheron's Call and Ultima Online. The next minute it's just
      like the RTS deluge of a few years back all over again. But this time it's
      much more dangerous for the unwary online game developer. Warcraft II and
      Command &amp; Conquer were released and soon followed by legions of
      piss-poor clones trying to ride the coattails of their success. How many
      of the games actually succeeded financially? Age of Empires and Total
      Annihilation come to mind and of course Starcraft and the C&amp;C sequels
      did well. That leaves dozens of games that bombed horribly.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Taking what history has taught us, look at
      what's happening to massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs).
      Ultima Online was sold at retail after a long series of beta testing by
      the public. At last count, UO had about 150,000 paying subscribers.&nbsp;
      Following Ultima Online we have Everquest, a 3D-accelerated monster backed
      by Sony that currently has over 300,000 players subscribed. Asheron's Call
      is the newest entry in the race for your online gaming dollar. Backed by
      Microsoft, AC still has a way to go before catching up to Everquest.&nbsp;All
      three games charge 10 dollars a month to play in addition to their retail
      box costs.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">As consumers, we are slowly getting used to
      paying a monthly fee for a game. In fact, its easy to justify when you
      consider the time invested and the cost for that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">My experience is limited to Everquest so I
      will use it as an example. I started playing EQ in beta 3. As I became
      used to the environment and all the commands, the time I invested slowly
      began rising to the point that an all night session was not unheard of.
      Three months later my total time spent with my wizard was about 22 days.
      That's 528 hours. Keep in mind this is only one character. I also acted as
      a guide for a few months and played other characters as well.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Knowing that people have spent hundreds of
      hours with a character in a now familiar environment, do developers really
      think they can pull gamers from one world to a new one? Granted, as
      popularity grows, more gamers will likely take the plunge. But there will
      certainly not be enough to support the number of games in development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">First, we have <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Anarchy
      Online</b></font></a>, a MMORPG set 30,000 years into the future. As you
      can well imagine, there will not be any Orcs or Elves in this one.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Next we have <a href="http://www.artifact-entertainment.com/horizons/horizons.htm"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Horizons:
      Empires Of Istaria</font></b></a>. This will be a fantasy role-playing
      game in the tradition of Everquest with many different races to choose
      from.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><a href="http://www.shadowbane.com"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Shadowbane</font></b></a>
      has recently secured GoD (Gathering of Developers) as a publisher. Here we
      have yet another fantasy MMORPG to add to the mix.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><a href="http://www.rossystem.com/unknown/index.htm"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Unknown:
      Quest for the Golden Dragon</font></b></a> is a single and multiplayer
      game. It should be interesting to see how this works out since the
      multiplayer game can support approximately 1000 people. At this point in
      time, they say there will not be a monthly fee to play online.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#F4F0F4"><b>Hero's Journey</b></font>
      has yet to score a publisher. From what I have read it holds promise but
      for now we shall have to wait and see.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b><font color="#F4F0F4">Middle Earth
      Online</font></b> is a wild card since the original development team was
      axed last fall. Sierra claims the game is still in development. Beyond
      that we have no info. Lets hope they continue development!&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Star Wars Online</font></b>
      is being developed by <a href="http://www.verant.com">Verant Interactive,</a>
      makers of Everquest. Of all the upcoming games I consider this one has the
      most potential. Verant has learned a lot from Everquest and I expect the
      marketability of Star Wars will help push it into the mainstream.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">At this point, everyone knows <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/Alteredworlds/#Origin Strikes Again">my
      opinion</a> of Origin. Regardless, <a href="http://www.uo2.com"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Ultima
      Online 2</font></b></a> is currently in development. It will be much more
      graphically intense than it's predecessor and from early information,
      leans a bit more towards the gameplay of Everquest and Asheron's Call.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Last we have <b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><a href="http://www.verant.com">Everquest
      2</a></font>.</b> Although it has not been officially announced, I think
      it is safe to assume Verant is going ahead with development.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">So, that's six upcoming projects with
      countless others in development that are unannounced. Roughly 600,000
      people are currently playing MMORPGs and there could be maybe double that
      in the next year or so. Considering how much it costs to build and
      maintain a persistent online world, I doubt there is enough pie at the
      table for everyone.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Best of luck to everyone currently working
      on a MMORPG. With all the competition, you're going to need it.&nbsp;</font></p>
