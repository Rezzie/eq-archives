    Ultima IX: Ascension. It will be placed in the vault of Ultima towards the end of the
    game. Here players will have the opportunity to play all previous Ultimas including
    Akalabeth. To this date, no one has made a conversion of Akalabeth and had it published.

    </strong></font><font color="#ffffff">Bout time is all I can say! I am greatly looking
    forward to this as I haven't touched my character for a while. Read on brave soldier:</font>
    <p><font color="#008080">We're finishing off the basic code for the new rep system, and we
    arrived at the conclusion that a single number for tracking both your good/evil nature and
    your fame isn't enough. So we're dividing it into two, which will together make up your
    &quot;reputation&quot; as displayed in a title. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#008080">Karma (these are internal names only btw) will be a positive and
    negative scale like notoriety. It will track good and bad deeds from the perspective of
    NPCs. This is what will determine things like whether you get spat at when you come into
    town, what sort of discounts shopkeepers give you, and so on. It is what players would be
    able to give each other points in, and it would be affected by various actions ranging
    from necromancy to healing to generosity, etc. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#008080">Fame will be a positive scale only. You gain it through
    advancement in skills, and questing, and other deeds. It decays away to 0 over time. And
    It affects things like whether NPCs bow to you, etc. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#008080">Bob Hanson's got an email with further details on this, and I am
    sure that <a href="http://www.skypoint.com/~bob/uo/">FAQ</a> updates will be forthcoming.
    The reason I am here now is to ask you about titles. :) </font></p>

    stats go up by a known issue within the game might be banned. We are not banning players
    who have had their stats raised accidentally, but rather we are banning those people who
    have done so in an effort to cheat, and therefore lessen the accomplishments of those
    players who have legitimately earned their stats.</font></p>

    needed to know. Yes that sweet ass OS called Win 98 is coming soon....very soon. I tell
    you, ever since I installed this joy filled software I have had no problems, crashes, or
    slowdowns at all! MS really listened to what we had to say and it looks like Win 98 is
    everything 95 should have been. <br>

    employee of Microsoft :) )</small></small></font><p><font color="#008080">Microsoft
    announced that it will be shipping RC0 (Release Candidate 0) of its Windows 98 software to
    about 30,000 beta testers within the next week or so. The Release Candidate stage of
    previous Windows versions has lasted for several iterations before the product was
    finalized and went to gold master. Microsoft is finalizing some features relating to power
    management and driver management before the RC0 release is shipped. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#008080">It's also been rumored that the ship date of Win98 has been
    pushed up to May 1, taking some distributors by surprise. While this hasn't been confirmed
    as of yet, it is possible that we'll see the new OS before the summertime. While DirectX6
    won't make it in at shiptime, we should see that new release of the gaming API later in
    the year. Windows 98 will offer USB, FireWire, WDM (for shared drivers with Windows NT),
    DVD and (well possibly) integrated Internet Explorer 4.0 and Active Desktop. </font></p>
