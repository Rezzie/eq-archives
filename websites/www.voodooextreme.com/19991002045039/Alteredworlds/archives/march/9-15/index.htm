    The final word count in the game is about 200,000! That's about as long as a 500-page
    novel. <br>
    NPC's in your party will each have about 50 voice tracks, while other major NPC's will
    have quite a few, and many minor NPC's will have one or two.</font><ul>

    invitation to display the firm's first DVD-based game. Called Lander, it's an updated
    version of C64 classic Thrust, in a full 3D world. Psygnosis displayed the DVD
    capabilities such as multiple camera angles, multiple languages on one disk, MPEG 2 FMV
    and music in Dolby 5.1 digital sound. Companies in attendance included the likes of Dolby,
    Creative Labs and Toshiba.</font></p>

    We're busy trying to put the final touches on the game. Hence the long delays between
    What's New sections - we literally don't have the time free to write a lot of stuff, even
    though (paradoxically) more stuff is happening now than ever before. Here's the scoop on
    what we've worked on over the past few weeks: <br>
    End movie is now finished aside from adding in sounds. It actually looks better than the
    Intro movie, if you can believe it. <br>
    Data entry and clipping of the terrain art moving forward and should be complete in 2
    weeks or so. <br>
    Doing fixes of clipping bugs. <br>
    Most of the GUI's now work - You can actually play the game! Creating a character is
    fairly slick. <br>
    Data entry of the first two chapters is ongoing - we're entering game data chapter by
    chapter, linking areas together, populating areas, bringing monsters and critters to life
    slowly but surely. <br>
    Sounds received for most of the voices in the game, and are being entered into our
    resource database now being mastered down at Interplay. It's fun to actually hear the
    voices of the characters that we have labored on for so long - they really come to life! <br>
    network code is still being worked on, as we develop the message layer and network layer
    code.<br>

    UOVault</a> has a letter from DD on this very subject that may put more fire in the
    kettle. Read on oh gentle reader:</font><p><small><font color="#008080">Here's what I said
    before, only in more detail. There are too many objects, and when many players have
    literally hundreds of runes, that's a prime candidate for reduction. And that is the
    motive at this time. Yes, we want to curtail use of recall, blah blah blah, but if we
    wanted to curtail the use of recall, my favored route is to charge mana based on distance
    and get rid of the current dungeon restrictions. We could go other routes. We could make
    it so you can only have one rune on you, or five, or whatever. We could make them
    &quot;unstable entities&quot; so they tend to go &quot;pop&quot; if they are unused for
    too long. Whatever. But zapping them when used is simple, fairly foolproof, and still lets
    you use them exactly as you do now. (Always mark a rune each time you recall). Some people
    won't do this for reasons of [time/mana/effort/carelessness], and hopefully rune hoarding
    will be reduced. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#008080">The immediate goal is item reduction, folks, not recall
    curtailing. Recall curtailing from this is at best a side effect. As I posted before, I
    feel that recall curtailing will only work once there's enough to do in the space that you
    tend to skip over now--enough adventure on the road that you don't mind walking through
    it. And before talking about recall curtailing, I'd rather talk about ways to make that
    journey more fun. On the day we manage that, then people will walk everywhere because it's
    cooler to do so. :) </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#008080">If you have better ideas on how to keep players to fewer
    runes hoarded, please pass 'em along. We're not wedded to this solution, it just seems the
    clear way to go at this time.</font></small></td>
