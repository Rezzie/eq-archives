        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">A U.S. Court of

        Appeals sided with Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday by stopping a 1997 lower court decision from

        The appellate court order -- which will have no effect on any new antitrust case that

        chance of winning a permanent injunction against Windows 98 under the old U.S. District

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>In rummaging around in

      the official WoT bag of tricks, all I can find is the development update again this week.

      I'm not swearing off the Viewer Mail or Counter Contest sections, but CGDC and E3 have

      made it impossible to write any more than this. I hope you all understand that--as Ian so

      eloquently expressed it--the less I write here, the more devoted I am to building the

      game. It's rough to be the critical path on a project AND be the webmaster of the official

      site. How did I let this happen? <br>

      <br>

      Of course I wouldn't give it up for the world, but I am looking for ways to make it easier

      on my schedule. In addition to my weekly content, this site needs a major overhaul--but

      there's no way that I can spend the time to do it. So I'm speaking with GT to find ways

      that they can help with the site without distancing me from the readership. I think the

      combination can actually work out well. If I can focus on the stuff thatmeans a lot to me

      (the updates) and let a dedicated webmaster spruce up and maintain the site, that is--in

      my eyes--a pretty good deal. <br>

      <br>

      Now let's get down to it. I just returned from the Computer Game Developers' Conference.

      Although there were over 7,000 people there (almost double last year's attendance), the

      new convention center housed them with room to spare. I met a lot of old friends, talked

      with some new ones, attended a bunch of seminars and round tables, and generally was

      reminded that--despite all of the project-related hassles and problems--creating games is

      pretty cool. We're damn lucky to be making a living doing something that we enjoy so much.

      Apart from the Spotlight awards (the comedy interludes were so bad that the performers

      were booing themselves), I had a lot of fun and even learned a bit. Of course, what made

      it all worthwhile were the countless free T-shirts (with an extra mousepad for totally

      annihilating my opponent at Forsaken--the Unreal machines were filled). Who needs to go

      clothes shopping? I've got a whole new wardrobe! <br>

      <br>

      The project went ahead without me while I was gone (thank the Gods). I've just laid my

      eyes on some more incredible architecture and textures for the Fortress of the Forsaken.

      These chambers just keep getting more elaborate and detailed. I hope to show some of this

      off at E3 and, perhaps, release a few more screen shots following. Keep your eyes open. On

      this topic, Julie--our new texture artist--just started work today. She'll be diving right

      into the Forsaken's House of Fun and I'm positive that her work will absolutely blow me

      away. Welcome aboard, Julie! <br>

      <br>

      Magic effects keep pouring in (that's what the programmers are focusing on right now).

      We've got some that you have to see to believe. Again, we'll be revealing a lot of them at

      E3. <br>

      <br>

      And so I'm back in the thick of it, killing time until Sabrina arrives in early

      June--after which she'll be sticking around until further notice. Sometimes, things just

      come together (so to speak). Feel free to congratulate me. :-) <br>

      <br>

      I'm really happy about The Wheel of Time's progress, both in terms of development and

      perception. Its profile is constantly rising (I only met a few people at the conference

      who hadn't heard of it) which can't help but continue after the GT marketing machine kicks

      in. And the game is simply fantastic and only getting better. <br>

      <br>

      Until next time!</small></font></p>

      character creation. We decided against facial hair and different body styles(weights,

      heights), and instead concentrated on having the six different player races. While I

      suppose it is a loss that you cannot choose between a fat, hairy human, and a buff,

      well-shaven human, we hope that the ability to play either humans, elves, dwarfs,

    World have been posting info on their discussion boards about 3 things... style of play,

    multi-player and their combat system.. hmm let's take a look shall we :)</font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">[about gameplay style]

      There's nothing released about that yet. Making a comparison between Third World and other

      games is difficult, we're creating a game type that doesn't really exist yet. However, the

      closest comparisons that come to mind are the turn based tactical games like X-com or

      Incubation, but played out in real time with a completely customizable team of characters.

      Everything about the characters is customizable, their race, stats, class, armor &amp;

      weapons, inventory, even their faces. The game is going to have a lot of cool tactical

      combat in it, but that's not its only focus. You'll also be solving logic puzzles,

      managing your team and trying to unlock the mysteries that threaten Third World. This is

      an entirely different experience.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">I can't really comment

      on our exact plans at the moment, but I can assure you that the multiplayer aspect of the

      game will appeal to both Action/Adventure RPG fans and Strategy fans. The &quot;how&quot;

      of that is the cool part, but I can't, at this time, explain that. E3 is at the end of the

      month, so we'll have a lot more information for you folks after that.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">...this is a place

      where the world isn't all happy and pretty. It's dirty, it's dark, it's gritty and it

      ain't a tourist attraction. It's a diverse place. You'll see everything from the blasted

      plains, ruins and deserts of the wastes to the hyper-industrialized urban city. It's all

      there. Imagine places that have so many factories that the sky literally burns at nights.

      Imagine places that have been worked so hard and mined so much that humans can't even live

      there anymore. You'll see it all, and fight through it all but you'll be doing a lot more

      too. This isn't a game where super fast reflexes are going to save your ass. You've got to

      think and think fast.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">On another note, the

      combat system in the game is versatile. It's not just about big guns, in fact, you'd

      better hope you're packing a knife or two when you go through Third World; sometimes a gun

      is just so much metal...</font></p>

    in the works from a company by the name of <a href="http://www.megnatech.com/ma">Mystical

    Ages Software</a>.&nbsp; They are working on a console style RPG for the PC entitled Time

    Switch.&nbsp; Here is what James Kurth CEO of Mystical Ages Software sent to me in reply

    to my question about Time Switch: -<a href="mailto:kairn@voodooextreme.com">Kairn</a></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <font color="#000000" size="2"><p align="left"></font><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">We appreciate your questions about our new project Time Switch and we are

      more than happy to give you as much information as possible, without spoiling you or

      others.&nbsp; First off, Time Switch is an RPG which will resemble much like console

      RPGs.&nbsp; Time Switch hopefully can get finished soon.&nbsp; We have no real deadline,

      but we hope to get this game completed before Christmas.&nbsp; Most software industries

      have long deadlines from which they started, like two years to complete a game or

      something.&nbsp; We, at Mystical Ages Software think that it's not the length of time

      required to do a game that is important.&nbsp; But it's the progress of the game within a

      period.&nbsp; So, if all goes accordingly at a faster pace, Time Switch could be finished

      before 1999.&nbsp; That is no definite guarantee though.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Time Switch is a secret project, underway in development.&nbsp; What had started as an

      idea has lead from one thought to another.&nbsp; And instead of implementing the storyline

      into a novel, we decided to make it interactive and build a game into it.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Time Switch was developed in June, 1997 from my game storyline idea.&nbsp; The story

      brings the player into a vast world to explore.&nbsp; The storyline is about a comet

      coming to threaten the world of Tinari.&nbsp; While the asteroid cycles around Mars,

      Tinari's gravitational force pulls the huge asteroid toward Tinari, but is too weak to

      pull the asteroid fully into Tinari's atmosphere.&nbsp; Instead, the asteroid, with mass

      energy grows as its cycled course was shifted.&nbsp; The residents of Tinari experience

      volatile atmospheric radiation as clouds cover up the skies.&nbsp; The asteroid soars off

      into open space with more energy than ever, forming a comet out of it.&nbsp; While this

      all was happening, because of the military and health departments being funded to research

      atmospheric pressure and radiation, the astronomy department of research lost their

      funding.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65

      years later, the comet returns in a direct intercept course for Tinari.&nbsp; While

      everyone hopes that military can dispose of the comet, a young hero with the name of Kaire

      steps in to save the world from mass destruction through travelling in time to get the

      astronomical research department funded.&nbsp; What seemed like an easy plan backfired,

      creating a set of doors leading to different realities, as an Empire is on the edge of

      world domination.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can

      Kaire and his pals restore peace in both eras of time?</font></p>

    Developers Board recently and had a few things to say that you EQ fans (Like me) will want

    to eat up: </small></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>The evil Teir'Dal (Dark

      Elves) tolerate Trolls and Ogres but view them as simpletons who can be used to enforce

      Dark Elf agendas.</small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Trolls hate everyone,

      including other Trolls. They are basically vicious anarchists.</small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Ogres, while just as

      evil (to non-Ogre eyes), are less likely to prey on thier own and have a more tribal like

      culture with a defined social structure. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Trolls and Ogres are

      marginally more intelligent than they are typically portrayed.</small></font></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" color="#C0C0C0"><small>Also of VERY cool note, that if

    you are an Ogre you will be able to hook up with a group of NPC Ogres and do some Player

    Hunting. Although I don't see much intellectual discussion happening here. No matter how

    good AI is these days. :) Gotta thank the lovely boys at <a href="http://www.eqvault.net/">EQVault</a>

    multiplayer? Personally I like Online RPG's for the social interaction, this may have to

    do with my job since I thrive on social interaction with other people on a daily basis.

    But it sounds to me as if some RPG players seem to enjoy isolating themselves and playing

    single player more? (Not that there's anything wrong with that.) Any thoughts out there on

    that? Here is another question, do you guys want to see more single player RPG's with

    Multiplayer as an addition or more specifically do you want to see more Online RPG's? I

      option within its box. These two games will have different Plots, and locations. So

      someone that plays the Single player thinks he/she can just enter the multi-player world

      they will soon learn the game is vastly different. In a way you are getting two games in

      the same box. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>It is a game that

      supports both alignments. We have designed plots, goals, and even locations that benefit

      the forces of good and evil. Guilds are being set up not to just to hunt evil characters

      but those who have not strayed in life. To continue in this format, spells items and even

      shops have been designed to benefit both good and evil. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Plots: Many. The overall

      plot will not be known until you enter theworld of the Unknown. Think of yourself as

      someone who as just finished training by his/her master. Once you enter the Realm this is

      where you will learn of the overall plot that has fallen upon the lands. </small></font></p>

      <br>

      David Gallay: My influences are pretty much seeing the way the world is going, how the

      power is being taken form the individual and going to the large mega-corporations. Combine

      that with an obvious serving of William Gibson for everything cyberpunk, a dash of Blade

      Runner for visual flair (along with some German expressionism to bring out the good

      shadows ), and lots of mediocre CRPG experiences to see what NOT to do. <br>

      <br>

      Stephen Adkins: What influenced me was Gibson and Blade Runner, but also Neal Stephenson's

      &quot;The<br>

      Diamond Age&quot; and &quot;Snowcrash.&quot; Also, the dream of being able to surf the net
