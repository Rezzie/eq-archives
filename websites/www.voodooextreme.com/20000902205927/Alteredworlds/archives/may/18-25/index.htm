    interested in what the actual game designers thought of Unreal and how their games will

    compare. Needless to say I was chatting with Ryan Dueckman of Valhalla about just this

    subject and he gave me some food for thought. BTW if you enjoy this subject check out my

    recent <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/Alteredworlds/interviews/ryan_valhalla.htm">Interview</a>

    with Ryan on Valhalla! - <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a></small></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>&nbsp; Yeah, I've been

      playing Unreal, it certainly lives up to it's name ..&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to be hard

      getting too much work done THIS week... :) As far as graphical effects in Valhalla go, I

      don't think you'll be at ALL dissappointed, even a year from now when it's released.<br>

      Valhalla is designed from the ground up to be extremely extensible and expandable, with a

      minimal amount of work.&nbsp; Instead of applying simple &quot;Textures&quot; to objects

      and faces like in a modern graphics engines, we apply &quot;materials&quot;.&nbsp; A

      standard material for Valhalla can <br>

      include animated textures, reflections(Real and simulated), bump maps, detail maps, even

      weight and other properties.&nbsp; However, if a level designer wants a certain effect for

      an area(Say, grass rippling <br>

      in the breeze), he simply creates a new &quot;Special effect&quot; material, with all the

      properties for a standard texture.&nbsp; The programmers are then able to think about the

      effect and what the best way to simulate <br>

      it would be, and they can program it in when they have the time, without anyone having to

      wait for it to be implemented.&nbsp; Likewise, if a programmer comes up with a new

      effect(Like wood burning in realtime), all that's needed of the level editors is going

      through <br>

      the main material library, and setting one or two new properties for all the object

      groups.&nbsp; No need to redesign any of the level.&nbsp; This gives us freedom to add any

      special effects we can think of throughout the design process, without a major time hit.

      &nbsp; (That's my <br>

      guess on why Unreal took so long to get finished.)</small></font></p>

      <i><p align="left"></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>After reading a

      few messages about various plots to not release the NID until E3, I felt compelled to

      answer with what I know. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>For nearly two months,

      the NID has been almost complete. We actually started working on this nearly a year ago

      now, and it has been reworked at least twice now with new graphics and various bug fixes.

      Why it wasn't released last year or a few months back, I'm not sure - that's Interplay's

      decision. For the past month though, we have been trying very hard to find solutions to

      most of the graphic bugs that appeared once we wrote the graphic test program. Each time

      we made one of the fixes, the program had to go back into QA and compatibility (even if

      the changes were to the readme file!). This sounds lame, I know, but the rules were

      recently set up down at Interplay to try and improve the quality of products that are

      released - this is a good thing, I think, even if it means delaying the demo a few days. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>The reason why the NID

      wasn't posted right after Feargus and the execs down at Interplay signed off on it was

      because we have to send a copy to the Interplay UK office before posting it to the world.

      That's what I was told in any event. So, I am told the NID WILL be posted by Monday or

      Tuesday &quot;for sure this time.&quot; Which admittedly is a day before E3.

      Hmm...maybe...No! Don't start me thinking that way too! </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>I heard from someone

      that the engine for EQ will just be the tanarus engine(just modified)... first off is that

      true? and will it move like the tanarus engine? because i don't know about u but with a

      keyboard its kinda diffacult to move around in it. will the moving forward and reverse be

      the same as tanarus? where when your going forward u just have to go to the speed u want

      then let go, and when u press down to go reverse will it just stop at 0 then u have to

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Hello again,<br>

      : First I would like to ask Brad to please post a brief message on the current standing of

      dragons in EQ (as in will there be colors, and how much will they differ from each, and

      will there be good,bad and neutral dragons) I hope to have this answered on the board or

      to bring it up at the next possible chat session. <br>

      : Next, because Eq has shown to be a product that is in many ways almost being designed by

      players, I thought it would be both interesting and helpful for us and the producers of

      the game if we on this board created a list of the colored dragons we would like to see

      and their attributes (as in size,breath,habitat,allignment,magic and anything else we can

      think of) I will take all the lists either posted on the board or mailed to me at

      hunt007@mindspring.com and combine them into the most liked ideas. I will then post it on

      the board , mail it to EQ and hopefully post it up on a webpage. Hopefully this action

      will show our dedication to the Norrath Universe and to a more diverse and interesting

      habitat. Thank you and I sincerly hope for your support for I will not be able to pull

      this off without your help</small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>It is our view

      that dragons are very exotic and rare creatures. Because of this, we are not going to list

      different types, nor their different attacks, alignments, colors, etc. Coming face to face

      with a dragon and doing combat with it (regardless of whether you live or die) will be

      something you can be really proud of. Many people who play EQ will never see a dragon --

      they'll only hear tales and such. In fact, from a purely gamers standpoint, I wouldn't

      have wanted to even show screen shots with the lava dragon. It's even my hope that those

      who do encounter dragons in EQ will keep the details to themselves... in a MUD I used to

      play quite often the ultimate foe was Tiamat, and I remember asking people about the

      dragon... where it was, how did it fight, what treasure it guarded, and I received very

      few, and then always vague, answers to my questions. And then, well over a year later,

      when I finally was able to face the creature, the awe and honor was that much greater. </small></font></strong></p>

    interview day no doubt. PCFan has an<a href="http://www.pcfan.com/pcfan/features/rayinterview.html"> interview</a> up with Dr Ray

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Joe: Important question:

      How does one engage battle in Baldur's Gate, similar to Diablo's point and click reference

      or is it more calculating like (Microprose's) Darklands? And how does one control battle

      events with multiplayers in Baldur's Gate? </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Dr. Ray: More

      calculating, but the interface allows for some default actions so if you L click on your

      enemies your party members will attack them.&nbsp; For more detailed actions, you use the

      hotkeys or the quick buttons at the bottom of the screen and then select a target.&nbsp;

      Overall I think it is a nice blend of the two systems - allowing for a high degree of

      control, but easy to use.&nbsp; We've spent over a year refining the controls and they

      have gone through at least four major revisions to this point. <br>

      &nbsp; <br>

      Joe: The screenshots look incredible by the way. Now, since you're not using tilesets and

      replacing it with prerendered backgrounds, how does gameplay and control work? Similar to

      Final Fantasy VII and Resident Evil? </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Dr. Ray: No, the game is

      real time, and you guide your party over the landscape much as in Diablo, except that you

      have much more control over what they do.&nbsp; We also include a pause game command that

      allows you to stop the game and assign party members actions. </small></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Q. Player killing or

      &quot;pkilling&quot; has always been part of multiplayer role-playing games, and EverQuest

      will allow players to attack and kill each other if that&#146;s the style of gaming they

      want to enjoy. But EverQuest, quite uniquely, allows players to opt out of pkilling, and

      allow them to role-play in an environment where they are safe from attacks by other

      players. Please explain how the &quot;no-pkilling&quot; switch will work in EverQuest, and

      what limits it puts on players who choose to use it.</small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>A. Player killing is a

      subject that is debated constantly on the net, and both sides to this eternal argument

      have great points. We want to accommodate both gameplay styles, but we don&#146;t want to

      separate the players in terms of which servers they can play on. So when a player creates

      a character, he or she will choose whether they want to participate in player killing or

      not. If they choose not to, then they will be immune to other player&#146;s assaults, and

      can only die in battle against NPCs. But those who like the added danger of player vs.

      player competition can simply create their character with player killing switched to on

      and then do battle with those who have chosen similarly. There has been some concern that

      this feature could limit freedom and role playing, but if you really think about it, the

      bottom line is that the only thing you can&#146;t do in EverQuest because of the PK switch

      is kill another player who doesn&#146;t want to be killed. And while this will purposely

      curtail the few who can only have fun at the expense of others&#146; enjoyment, the rest

      of us can go ahead and have a great time playing the game, regardless of whether our

      personal definition of role-playing includes player vs. player or not.</small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Q: You have indicated

      that there will be twelve races that players can choose from in EverQuest. Tell us a bit

      about the different races in EverQuest. Will the races have a history of interacting with

      each other? Will certainly races have &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; alignments?</small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>A. Evil and good are a

      bit more relative in EverQuest than in other games&#133; for instance, I doubt the Dark

      Elves really feel they are evil, however the Wood Elves certainly view them that way. And

      there is indeed a history of races interacting with each other&#133; wars, racial hatreds,

      and the like.</small></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>I know that when the

      earliest I can start writing the update is 7:00pm, there won't be any Mail fun. I'll say

      my piece about it, then no more complaining. E3 preparations are taking all of my time.

      I'm hoping that, after it's all done, things will settle back down and I can indulge in

      some Viewer Mail and Counter Contest goodness. I haven't given up on them (and it's

      actually quite hard not to write them based on some of the material that I've received

      lately). I think that, after you've read about what we're showing at E3--either here or in

      the press following the event--you might forgive me. <br>

      <br>

      Naturally, we'll be showing the Fortress of the Light with all new skies (based on the

      latest Unreal engine build); this was the level used to produce all of the current screen

      shots. I'll be using that to demonstrate The Wheel of Time's artistic direction and many

      of the game's basic features. <br>

      <br>

      I'll also be introducing a new environment, based on the Fortress of the Forsaken

      architecture, which is absolutely stunning. I was going to whip up a simple level to

      showcase some the game's trickier AI and combat situations, but since the Forsaken's

      primitives were coming along fairly quickly--and were so attractive--I asked one of our

      level designers to incorporate them into my test design. Pieces of this map are coming

      together right now and the results are breath-taking. The architecture and texture maps

      were intentionally designed in a completely different style than our previous level, but

      they are no less impressive or effective than those in the Fortress of the Light. Our

      artists and level designers are clearly maturing in this process. I plan to release some

      new screen shots at E3 from this environment to illustrate what I'm talking about. <br>

      <br>

      We're also toiling hard to polish up citadel customization and magic effects. Soon, I'll

      be spilling the beans about both of these design elements and explaining why they're so

      different than anything that's come before. I think we're going to see a whole new breed

      of people who excel at this game: people with a real understanding of strategy, those who

      can think on their feet as well as pull a trigger. <br>

      <br>

      I participated in a round table at CGDC that discussed the licensing of technology to

      build games. One person there voiced the opinion that the only advancements possible were

      in the realm of technology; different games that used the same engine were essentially the

      same game. Well, he was wrong. No one who sees our demo will think that they're looking at

      Unreal, or any other game using our beloved engine. No one who plays our game will mistake

      it for Quake, or any other FPS. <br>

      <br>

      It's difficult to be proud and excited and not sound immodest; I hope you'll give me the

      benefit of the doubt. If next week doesn't swallow me up completely, I'll be back to tell

      you all about our progressing demo. If not, I'll see you when the smoke clears and you can

      decide for yourself if it's me blowing the rings. After preaching my cause for so long,

      I'd much prefer my work to speak for me. <br>

      RtK will have both of these qualities, with some left over for good measure. The game will

      so, what will the max players be in multiplayer mode? Will you have one

      <i><p align="left"></i><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Q. Can you please

      go into HOW you plan to Curb PK'rs.<br>

      A. This seems to be the heart of many people's questions. Most of you feel the game will

      become a blood bath of evil pkr's outside the game.. Well listed below are a few of the

      many solutions we have come up. All of them are either online or are being placed online..

      </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>a) We have plots,

      spells, skills that only good or evil can have... Some have both.. This will allow Evil

      characters to hunt around for things they want and good can hunt for theirs. (SO evil will

      not be bored) </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>b) Monsters will hunt

      down evil characters not just good. And we have certain monsters that will only hunt down

      evil such of that that only certain monsters will only hunt down good.. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>c) You can go to prison

      if caught. And it sucks. Not like UO you get out in 15 minutes it could be Days. Hey this

      is real life.. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>d) We are working on a

      trial system. (We hope to have it ready in Phase 1 of the Beta test) </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>e) NPC's will have

      guilds on both sides.. </small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>f) The combine level of

      a party can not attack or kill a party up to 4 levels below them. So if a party has 4

      people in a area and wishes to pick on that little 2nd level mage think again.. The game

      will not permit it.. UNLESS the mage wishes to attack those 4 people then it becomes fair

      game.. (Note Certain area's will not have this system) (Example: City of Hellish) </small></font></p>
