      the AI is now dependent on the NPC, Partymember, or Monster's Perception and IQ - and we

      are probably going to be putting more of that in. One of the guys on the team got his

      character killed this morning because he thought the Combat AI was going to act like it

      running, and it's both playing and (for once) looking really nice. We're getting much

    My view? After seeing the game at E3 I was very impressed and think it will surely live up

    to it's hype. Now to address those concerns that it won't be an RPG etc. Well, my belief

    is that it's really time to evolve or die. Origin could have easily made a game with an

    old engine and tons of Dialogue, but then it would have just been another Ultima. I am

    impressed that origin is really taking these risks like UO and Ultima 9. It's about time

    someone started ignoring the pricks in the suits and make games that are inventive and

    original. And Ultima 9 is defenitely that. It takes some serious Nads to invest in the

    future like this. U9 is cutting edge and should hopefully continue to take RPG's further

    into the future. - <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a></small></font></p>

    that Gamesouce has slapped up a fat <a href="http://www.gamesource.com/features/future/">article</a>

    on the future of 3D gaming.&nbsp; To make a game in 2D in todays market is unwise due to

    the restrictions with what you can do with it. After seeing Unreal you get the idea of the

    incredible potential of this market! 3D is the way...use the force and follow the path.

    Most games you see coming out in 2D nowadays are games that have been in development for a

    while like BG. Although Diablo 2 still gets me miffed. I know i'm jumping on Blizzard

    pretty hard...but if your gonna make a sequal at least upgrade and not use some antiquated

    old engine. - <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a></small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Tucked in a small back

      room of the GT Interactive booth, we were treated to a preview of what looks like one of

      the more original first-person shooters we've seen. The Wheel of Time is based on the

      popular fantasy novels penned by Robert Jordan...the game is actually set before the

      action in Jordan's world. Although the action takes place in a (beautifully rendered)

      fantasy setting, it plays like a shooter (utilizing the Unreal engine). Instead of bullets

      and grenades, you've got over 50 spells to cast on your opponents; but what really sets

      The Wheel of Time apart is the strategic role each player takes in preparing the others'

      challenges. Your character must go out into the world to seek power-ups and two mystical

      seals to make your collection of four complete. You have to leave your two existing seals

      behind in your palace, however...to defend them, you can set traps and deploy troops. Each

      player has different types of grunts to place around his or her palace and

      semi-intelligent captains, whom you can give simple orders, to boss them around. It was

      one of the better demos seen at E3...we're crossing our fingers that The Wheel of Time

      lives up to its initial promise. </small></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Being a fan of the

      novels, my first priority was to see Wheel of Time, being shown only behind closed door.

      This one is finally taking shape. It's another first person action game, but I wouldn't

      call it a shooter since all combat is handled through magic (or channeling as fans of the

      series would call it). Legend Entertainment is trying to keep things loyal to the books,

      but that's not an easy task, so they decided to keep the game taking place just before

      where the first book takes off. <br>

      <br>

      You'll want to search the game's universe looking for artifacts because these precipitate

      into tools to promote your cause, weapons or otherwise. You start the game with two

      'seals' in your possession, and need to find two more, so in a radicle twist to first

      person games, while you're raiding someone's castle to get their seal (should it even be

      there!) someone could be sieging your domain. And for that reason, you'll need to prepare.

      Before leaving, you'll need to set traps and troops to keep your enemies out. I was amazed

      to see this process done so simply - it's no Quake editor - simply click on the spot on

      the wall that you want a spear to fly out and it's there. Amazing innovation here. <br>

      <br>

      Also impressive is the use of AI tactics like enemies running away to call for

      reinforcements, something you don't want to let happen. You'll defend yourself with such

      cool oddities as homing decay spells and such. This one has spent a long time in design,

      but it's not yet close to release, and Legend is looking ahead to Q2 '99.</small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF"><small>Level design was very

      impressive and Mr. Dahlgren explained a little about the process. &quot;Instead of just

      slapping together levels like most 3D games, we take the time to design these environments

      on paper and make them feel and look as realistic as possible, in turn presenting the

      player an atmosphere that feels real.&quot; That's no hype. Watching Glen stroll around

      the exterior of a castle had all the detail you'd expect to find in an Elmore fantasy

      levels and environments in Wheel of Time are some of the best you're likely to find in the

      foreseeable future. Add to this the interesting gameplay approach, user involved citadel

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">We at Mystical Ages

      Software are happy to tell everyone of the new changes of Time Switch.&nbsp; First of all,

      we are now making this game Windows 95 compatible.&nbsp; In addition, since it's Windows

      95, we are using DirectX 5.0 for Time Switch.&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">So, what we had

      planned a long time ago has changed, as here are some the new features used in Time

      Switch:</font></p>

      <ul>

        <li><p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">All Battles will

          have perspective shifting. (Camera rotation) </font></p>

        </li>

        <li><p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Everything will be

          3D with special zoom-in/out functions that FF7 lacked. (We can make FMV-like scenes out of

          moving the views and zooming in or out) </font></p>

        </li>

        <li><p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">3D accelerators will

          be required for this game, but it will surely speed up the game. </font></p>

        </li>

        <li><p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Better music and

          audio.</font></p>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Another thing I want

      to talk about is a celebration for anyone to attend.&nbsp; It will be a celebration to

      celebrate the beginning of the implementation process on the Time Switch project.&nbsp; I,

      will host this celebration, and anyone who wants to ask questions about Time Switch are

      more than free to do so.&nbsp; I will answer any questions that I think could be given out

      to the public at this time.&nbsp; Some topics could include:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">Characters, vehicles,

      length, format of the game, specs, plot, conflicts, etc.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">The celebration

      meeting will be hosted on IRC, server: undernet.&nbsp; The channel will be titled:

      #TimeSwitch.&nbsp; The meeting will begin on June 21, 1998 at 1:00pm Pacific Standard

      Time.&nbsp; This will be the only time when we'll answer any question about the

      game.&nbsp; So if you have a question, or would like to learn more about our game, Time

      Switch then please attend this meeting.</font></p>

    <font face="Tahoma" size="2">Ok, I've archived the page and got my ass out of the Unreal

    world for at least a couple of minutes!</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Ok.. here ya go.. It's been 3 years or more

    since I heard about this game that I read about from Epic called Unreal!&nbsp; I saw early

    screenshots and thought it looked cool... real medieval looking.. so I decided to open up

    a web site about it called &quot;the Unreal World&quot; (don't know if any of you guys out

    there remember it... Pailhead - that was me! Hey ask Sacrates about it, that's how we met.

    &nbsp; Holy shit, it's been that long).&nbsp; Well I did pretty good job at it since I had

    to many hits on it and my ISP asked me to shut it down. (which sucks, and this was back

    when nobody hosted us.... how times change)&nbsp; Well, a year went by, no Unreal! &nbsp;

    Two years went by, no Unreal!&nbsp; I started to doubt the game I so wanted to play.&nbsp;

    I mean two years is an average cycle for a game to go through start to gold... Well.. I

    slowly forgot about the game, and started to think vaporware (....Gasp). &nbsp; Then Quake

    2 came up in November, I believe, and that was &quot;the shit&quot;, loved that game the

    graphics everything.&nbsp; Then in February,&nbsp; Sacrates pointed me to screenshots for

    this game I quit watching for months (and I mean months) earlier... there's that name

    again Unreal. Well.. those screenshots where of nothing I had set my eye's on in my whole

    3D FPS career.&nbsp; Beautiful, colorful.. frightening. Ok.. now it's May and I hear

    Unreal is shipping and in stores... I pick it up, install the monster at a whopping

    450MB.&nbsp; I go and click on the nice U icon on my desktop and am blown away!!!!&nbsp;

    How could I have ever doubted a game like this.. my god, it is the most beautiful, lush,

    colorful and at the same time frightening game I have ever played, save for maybe Doom

    (got to give the id guys credit there).&nbsp; The music is amazing, how it changes with

    the action and the situation your in.&nbsp; The monsters are incredible.. the AI is some

    of the best I have ever seen.. period. Architecture is very cool.. and the levels

    themselves take hours to complete (well at least for me since I usually kill something and

    walk around in awe).&nbsp; It's just beautiful.. and I mean it!&nbsp; Quake and Quake 2

    are like Wolfenstein and Doom to this game... I'm sorry I love id software's stuff (ok so

    Quake was boring), but this game kicked their ass'!&nbsp; If only I could have stuck with

    the game all the way from it's infancy... I feel bad about that, too... &nbsp; But in the

    end, Epic Megagames and Digital Extreme have kicked our ass' with the best 3D FPS to grace

    our computer screens... Ok if you were to pick up just one game, I would have to point you

    too Unreal.. as Nike so eloquently put it &quot;Just Do It&quot;!</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Ok.. enough of my ramblings... let's get back

    That means we should hopefully get back on a regular update cycle again. The past few days

    have been tough since I was away at E3 and I just found out why Kairn and Bowmeister

    haven't updated....Unreal. ;) Hehe....just listen to me on this one boys and girls, it is

    one of the all-time great games in this Industries short lifespan. Get it. That is...if

    you have the machine for it. Anyway, we'll get some smack to you before you know it. I may

    be off for a little while after this post due to the fact that my Cable modem is getting

    installed today so hold tight and hopefully my fellow web monkeys will be able to fish up

    some news for you. - <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a></small></font></td>
