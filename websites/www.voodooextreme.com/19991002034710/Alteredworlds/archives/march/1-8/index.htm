    These are sweet shots, and can't wait to get my hands on this puppy... also on this
    subject while I was at Psychonews they have a little blurb about the development:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"><p></font><font size="3" color="#808080">&quot;..
        The design team has mainly been mocking up levels and brainstorming mission designs, now
        that we have our prototype missions to feed our ideas and confirm or disprove our
        suspicions. We've got a lot of good ideas, and a few crackpot schemes. Only some of them
        are stolen from System Shock, Terra Nova, and Ultima Underworld, and the ones that are we
        promise to disguise so it's harder to tell where we stole them from. <br>
        <br>
        Kate's been integrating her creature motion tools better into our level-editor, one small
        effect of which is that it will be easier for us to change creature models and generally
        get more critters types in our draft levels (and screenshots). Chris is working on the
        player-character body physics, which is all wrapped up in implementing crouching,
        crawling, impact whiplashes in combat, maybe leaning, eventually climbing ... basically
        all movement and maneuver modes where the PC doesn't move like a tank. A side effect of
        this is that it's really easy to loosen the player-character's neck until his head bobbles
        around and you get seasick. Can't argue with fun like that.&quot;</font><em><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"> </font></em></p>

    </strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF">I just noticed that <a href="http://www.igs.net/~tinman/gnews.htm" target="_top">Tinman Studios</a> has updated
    their new page with an development update for Gothica... </font><blockquote>
      <font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"><p></font><font color="#408080" size="3">We've
      been working hard on the Necromancer area in Gothica. This is a very<br>
      large dungeon that is strewn across an ancient, ruined landscape. The action <br>
      takes place both inside and outside of these ruins. Dilapidated rope bridges <br>
      made of bone shakily span pools of stagnant sludge. This is the home of the <br>
      Undead.<br>
      <br>
      This new area includes a lot of cool interactive features. The rope bridges <br>
      actually stress under the weight of your character. Skiffs can be used to <br>
      float along some of the larger water areas. We've been working on a healthy <br>
      set of monsters for this area as well. Right now, we will have zombies, <br>
      skeletons, mummies, flying bat skulls, undead knights, and skeleton spiders.<br>
      <br>
      All of these new changes in Gothica are very extensive. The Necromancer <br>
      area looks so good and so cohesive that all of our current screen shots have <br>
      been put to shame. Along with a new user interface system, we've been able <br>
      to bring the game up another notch in quality. We are so excited about these <br>
      changes that we are preparing a big update to the web site with new screen shots... &quot;

    of the most interesting new titles shown at Psygnosis' recent Psybadek showcase to the
    press was Escape Or Die Trying. Featuring four different characters to play, Escape ODT is
    an RPG which sees gamers trying to escape from a tower which wouldn't be out of place in a
    Riana Rouge bondage fantasy. The tower is a full 3D world made entirely of polygons, and
    initial hype is promising level bosses comprised of more than a thousand polygons. A
    thirty frames per second frame-rate is promised, and the game is to be released on
    PlayStation and PC, with the PC version replete with multiplayer options.</font></p>
