      <p align="left"><font size="2"><font color="#FF00FF"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I've read

      every comment on Daggerfall and everything on most other games as well. We're not under

      any delusions as far as the state of our games and their success and failures. REDGUARD

      will NOT be DAGGERFALL. They are different games, different types of games. REDGUARD is

      something nobody has really tried (well not since the early days, when designers actually

      tried something new). It is not an RPG, it is not an adventure, and it is not an action

      game. There are elements of all those things in it, but it is the combined effect of many

      types of interaction into an epic swashbuckling tale. Daggerfall may have been a game in

      the world of Tamriel, but you've never really touched the world the way you can in

      REDGUARD. Again, I'll post more when I can, and keep in mind that for all the hits we

      take, we're still going to make the games that capture our imaginations. Perhaps Markus

      will even like it? Who knows? If he doesn't, I welcome his comments</font></font></p>

      we hit Alpha last Monday, and are planning to put the game into QA around the middle of

      next month. Things are looking pretty good and we are reasonably on schedule. We have

      about 6 designers and 4 scripters working on implementing the areas and they have gotten

      through about 25% of them so far. <br>

      <br>

      The Lead Programmer is going to start working on the new Combat AI pretty soon. We talked

      last week for a couple hours about different things that we could add to the AI to make

      things act more realistically. <br>

      <br>

      New thing we are adding is to have weapons that you can set to Full Auto. <br>

      hasn&#146;t been finalised yet but there will definitely be more slots for equipping

      items. The present box has the headgear (or a mask), necklace, torso and left and right

      arms but there are also slots below the torso and these may be for boots, leggings, belt

      and the surplus item sack. We&#146;ve all put plenty of game-hours into finding that

      &#145;perfect&#146; item for our character to wear or use, e.g. the King&#146;s Sword of

      Haste and perhaps a Godly Plate of Whale. There wasn&#146;t too much emphasis on which was

      the best set to wear, very much a mix&#145;n&#146;match affair. However, equipping your

      character will now turn into a quest challenge in itself. Finding the Holy Shield of

      Defence, for example, and deciding that these are the attributes you are after will set

      your own personal quest to find a Holy BreastPlate of Defence and the Helm or mask to

      match. Getting all three isn&#146;t just some fashion coup though, your perseverance for a

      full set of equipment will be rewarded with a bonus, a healthy bonus. Equipment will also

      have class-specific attributes, so although a Plate may have some tasty attributes they

      may be much better suited to a class other than your own. For your character to reach its

      full potential means trading or selling that piece and continuing your search for a more

      appropriate item.</font></p>

    little shebang called <a href="http://www.gamespot.co.uk/pc.gamespot/features/unreal_week/02.html">Unreal week</a>

    that you guys may be interested in. Normally I won't post stuff like this here...but

    Unreal is the engine for WOT and in all probability many more 3D RPG's down the road too.

      we prepare for the double whammy of <a href="http:\\www.cgdc.com\">CGDC</a> and E<sup>3</sup>.

      <a href="http://www.lglass.com/p_info/dark/darkdiary.html#6-27-97">Ten months ago</a> we

      had little more than a renderer and an innovative plan to show at E<sup>3</sup>, and we

      previewed in a little room hidden behind the <a href="http://www.lglass.com/f2/index.html">Flight

      Unlimited&nbsp;2</a> guys. This year we'll be just a bit shy of entering Beta and out on

      the show floor in a pretty big way. Compared to E<sup>3</sup> last June we'll have a whole

      new creature renderer to bring us up to the state of the art, new special effects and

      hardware acceleration, lots of new motions and sounds, and five actual production mission

      areas ready to show. And that's just the stuff you can tell on a trade show floor. So, I'm

      looking forward to the show this year, if I can survive the month between now and then. </small></font></p>

      &quot;nearly-shipping&quot; inventory interface based on what we learned from our

      prototype. The design gang is still cranking away on mission areas (of which I think we'll

      soon have some new <a href="http://www.lglass.com/p_info/dark/vision.html">screenshots</a>).

      Much of the programming focus is on a bunch of AI, animation, and game system tasks to get

      new creature types in the game. Our first round of new creatures, showing at E<sup>3</sup>,

      will be zombies who don't act just like guards for a change, fire elementals, and the

      noxious reptilian race of &quot;burricks.&quot; What I mean by &quot;noxious&quot; in this

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">Jason: We're doing

      pre-production and building tools and technology. The first elements we're assembling are

      the graphics engine and the &quot;world&quot; engine. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">The graphics engine will, of

      course, be really nice and have all the expected bells and whistles like dynamic colored

      lighting, bump mapping, advanced character animation system using inverse kinematics

      (bones), full hardware acceleration support (quite possibly requiring it), 16/24-bit

      rendering, beautiful outdoor landscapes seamlessly integrated with indoor areas, and the

      list goes on. Most of the core graphics engine is done, with the exception of integrating

      the terrain rendering with the portal-based interior rendering. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">Jason: Major, yes - but

      graphics are not THE selling point. The interaction is. The &quot;world&quot; engine

      consists of several systems that, together, will allow us to create cinematic experiences

      with unparalleled interactive depth. So, while there will be action elements to spice up

      the gameplay, the game is a role-playing game at heart since the player will have stats,

      relationships, quests, and an epic story to follow. Sounds like &quot;yadayada&quot; but

      we're approaching the game on a very deep and meaningful level, where we hope to take a

      step beyond offering a transitory, forgettable waste of time to players and entering the

      coveted realm of Art.</font></p>

    which is designed to test the DirectX compatability of your video card.. Hell here's

    alittle more of the 411...</font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">The graphic test

      program does NOT contain any of the actual game engine, though some of the artwork from

      the game is used to make it all look nice. Rather, the driver test makes a series of

      DirectX calls to check if your video card driver is 100% DirectX compliant. To see if the

      graphic test is working, you need to read the readme file that is zipped with it - at

      least the first 4 sections. This will instruct you on what the test should do, and what it

      might do if there are problems. </font></p>

      <font color="maroon"><p align="left"></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF00FF">Blizzard

      Entertainment is facing a lawsuit as a result of its brief fling with copying information

      such as e-mail addresses from some users' computers running its Starcraft video game.

      Albany attorney Donald P. Driscoll has sued the Irvine company and its corporate parent,

      Cendant Corp., under California's unlawful business practice laws, and charges that the

      company violated laws that prohibit the introduction of a ''contaminant'' designed to

      transmit information from a user's computer without the user's permission. Blizzard says

      it only collected information to resolve technical issues, did not keep the information,

      and no longer collects such information. </font></p>
