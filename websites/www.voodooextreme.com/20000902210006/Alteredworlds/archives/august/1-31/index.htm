    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">&quot;As many of you
      know, 0.993b has been delayed. The main reason for this is due to two major bugs that are
      actually in Windows NT and VB5/VB6 TCP/IP (Winsock) handling. I just got off the phone
      with Microsoft, and they should be getting back to me this week. I would release the game,
      but the problem is that one of the bugs is with MP and hangs all NT systems (works on 98
      -- go figure). Anyway, once again, I apologize for the delay, but there's only so much I
      can do now until I get a solution from MS, which should hopefully be no later than the end
      of this week. Also, when 0.993b is released, it will be full-screen DirectX.<br>

      glimpse of what I'm talking about--even though it's already somewhat out of date.&nbsp;
      This thumbnail illustrates a sample scene produced mostly just to show the potential of
      some of the primitives.&nbsp; As I've said before, nothing you see here is final,
      including lighting, architecture, or texture maps, but it does give you an idea about our
      direction.&nbsp; The European influence (especially medieval Italian cities) in the
      architecture is very clear. &nbsp; The level designers are really excited about the game
      play possibilities that the SL primitives hold.&nbsp; After running around in a few of
      them, I'm convinced as well. &nbsp; Shadar Logoth is going to be really cool--and that's
      not even considering how hard the Minion, Mashadar, or Legion are going to rock (just ask
      Ryan!).</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">Onto the combat portion
      of things. Each character in the party can have a &quot;script&quot; that dictates how
      they behave in battle. There are choices for a few of the classes, but I couldn&#146;t
      spot the &quot;hang back and shoot spells&quot; choice for the wizard in the party. So you
      set up how the people will behave AHEAD of time because when combat starts you typically
      don&#146;t know where or why or with who. If you party is moving across the map, suddenly
      one will yell a battle cry and take off. Sometimes the other people in the party will help
      and sometimes not. Sometimes they just stand behind other people because they can&#146;t
      figure out how to get around to attack. This is not Diablo, folks. Clicking like mad does
      nothing. You pick a target and hope for the best. The reason that they have the complex
      scripts is because combat is quite confusing. With no &quot;real&quot; way to control the
      people all you can do is sit back and watch. What doesn&#146;t help is that the trees
      often will block most of what&#146;s going on if you&#146;re outside. This makes wolf
      attacks all the more interesting.</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">When your party enters
      combat, suddenly things get all <i>Diablo</i>, or <i>WarCraft</i>. Creatures advance on
      you, and they don't waste any time, so you'd better be ready to respond. Hostile creatures
      appear with a red circle underneath them, and if you hold your cursor on them, a sword
      icon will appear. Click the creature, and all selected party members will attack it. You
      need only do it once...party members will hack on the creature until it's dead or they're
      dead. They will also pursue it if it flees, or shifts its position. </p>
      <p align="left">You can't just click and forget though. If one monster appears, you order
      your party to attack it, they surround it, and usually the results are a forgone
      conclusion. But what if there's more than one monster? What if they attack from different
      directions? You then must quickly select the right characters to attack the threat. You
      can click portaits or assign them individually, or you drag a box on the screen (like an
      RTS) to select more than one unit, and order them to attack. It is therefore very
      important that you have your party in correct formation, and that you know where what
      characters are, with what weapons and spells. In other words, be ready before combat even
      starts. </font></small></p>

      <br>
      As to 2: The language will be something of a hybrid... there will be enough old english so
      that it sounds Britannian, but it will not be Shakespearean. The accents of the characters
      will reflect their origin.. ie, American only if they are American (but there will be no
      regional american dialects, like cowboy, new york, etc). There will be all manners of
      British/English dialects, given to appropriate characters.</font></small></p>

    </font></small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">Character creation is
      still being brainstormed.. The plan is to bring back the gypsy, although how exactly
      she'll be used is not defined at this point. Also, there's been some talk about sending
      the player through some sort of a directed mini-quest, where the choices the player makes
      defines the type of player he becomes. However, players, when they realize what's
      happening, usually go back through the whole process making the choices that will get them
      to the character they want, which sort of defeats the whole purpose. So, I'd like to give
      you more details about it, but that's sort of where it stands at this moment.<br>
      <br>
      As far as combat goes.. I've mentioned on the board before, RG wants to go ahead and keep
      quiet on this topic. He feels that if he describes combat, as it is currently designed,
      there will be a lot of debate as to whether or not that's a good way for combat to be..
      and he'll have to spend time convincing people that it -is- a good way to go.. only to
      find that for whatever reason (technology, art, whatever) the system will have to be
      changed and then RG'll be faced with having to convince everyone of why something else is
      the best choice for the combat system... however, I will absolutely pass on the
      information regarding autocombat/turn based/pause button. It's valuable input and we all
      appreciate it.<br>
      <br>
      PS: I'm working hard to get an official board up.. the feeling is that we should be
      getting a really solid board in place, one with good security, looks nice, and has all the
      functionality we're looking for. I proposed trying to do some kind of short term interim
      solution, and the over riding opinion here is that if we do something short term, when we
      move to the permanent solution, people will get a very unsettled feeling, and it will do
      more harm than good. So, I'm working to speed along the final decision on our technology,
      so that we can begin the boards as soon as possible. I'm working on some other features,
      too.. developer diaries, MOIpoints contests, etc. These all require proposals, then having
      the technology built.. so I hope you'll bear with me.</font></small></p>

    goods (It's big, but it's all juicy info.) - <a href="mailto:rbowmaster@shaw.wave.ca">Bowmeister</a></small></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">I wish we could make
      them that fast (and have them still be good :) - more likely, mission packs will take
      about 4-6 months each, so the first one will probably come out about 4 months after the
      main game, since we started on it last month. <br>
      <br>
      However - with regards to multiplayer - six players per game, max, but you can have any
      number up to six in any given game (even as few as one, but I explain why this is useful
      below). Each player controls one or more characters assigned to him or her by the leader
      of the game. <br>
      <br>
      Here's how it works: the &quot;leader&quot; spawns a new multiplayer game. Anyone with the
      single player game can create a new multiplayer session (and since the art of the game is
      stored on five CD's, each player requires a full copy of the game to play). After the
      multiplayer session is created, players can join in either by logging in a new multiplayer
      session with the correct IP address (TCP/IP over the Internet) or over a LAN - or else
      they can connect over the Internet game connect service (free) that we plan to set up.
      Alternatively, they can connect via a modem or serial cable (we have not implemented these
      last two yet but plan to over the next month). <br>
      <br>
      The leader controls a lot of things, and we like to make the analogy that the leader is
      like a DM - someone who ensures that the game runs smoothly, that no one is cheating
      (unless he or she wants to allow deathmatches or cheating - you never can account for
      individual preferences!). The sorts of things that the leader/DM controls include: a) what
      can be brought into the game (in terms of importing characters from the single player
      game) - either only stats and a level one character (created at the time of the
      multiplayer session or stripped down from a character in a single player session of a
      player), or stats and EP/levels, or stats, EP/levels, and items; b) whether players (and
      specifically which players) can pause the game, initiate dialogue, initiate spending group
      gold, look at other player's inventories, leave areas, edit characters, etc. The whole
      point is that no programming can ever control the truly creative minds that game players
      have - cheating will happen, and only a human DM can moderate it effectively. Our model is
      the old style pen and paper RPG of AD&amp;D, and we want to recreate the experience of
      playing AD&amp;D around the kitchen table with a group of friends. <br>
      <br>
      The story in the multiplayer session of Baldur's Gate is not random; rather, it is the
      same as in the single player game. We chose this for several reasons. First, we wanted the
      story to be coherent and well-designed, much like a pen and paper module. Second, since
      there are no tiles in the game, we cannot generate random terrain at all in this game. The
      DM/leader in BG multiplayer is limited to coordinating the activities of the group - he is
      the leader of the party, not a DM in the classic definition. Third, the multiplayer game
      that we wanted to develop is a long term one - we wanted a group of players to keep
      playing together through a long session over a period of weeks rather than joining up with
      a new group of strangers ever day - we felt that the group would get to know one another
      and even begin to roleplay, which was always one of the best parts of playing the pen and
      paper RPG's of old (at least for the dev team :). <br>
      <br>
      We also decided to implement the ability to play multiplayer with one player only. The way
      this would work is that one player spawns a new game, but does not listen to
      &quot;join&quot; requests from other players. In this manner, you can get around the
      single player restriction of only being able to create one character. If you choose to
      play this way, you can create some or even all of the party, or even import several
      favourite characters from single player to begin a new game or a mission pack. We
      recommend you try some of the NPC's who can join you though - they have great sounds and
      personalities and will make the game much more entertaining. <br>
      <br>
      If a leader wants to drop out, he can email the save game file to one of the players, who
      can spawn a multiplayer session and load in that save game file, then wait for everyone to
      join. If an individual player wants to drop out of the game permanently, he can save his
      character locally (for use in other multiplayer games), and the DM/leader then can
      reassign the control of that player's character to another player (including the DM). That
      player can be deleted or edited by the new controlling character, and a new character
      could be created or imported (according to the import restrictions imposed by the
      DM/leader). <br>
      <br>
      There is extendibility in the multiplayer model that we have created - you can plug a
      mission pack into the main game and either play it single or multiplayer. </font></small></p>

      cut scenes, characters, objectives, etc.&nbsp; In doing so, I've focused the game to
      include only what it absolutely needed.&nbsp; I thought it was going to be more of a
      surgical strike to eliminate excess missions, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, I dove deep back
      into the design fundamentals.&nbsp; The process actually made the story much
      tighter.&nbsp; Elements which felt peripheral to the main plot were either cut or
      developed into something much more significant.&nbsp; The result is something that I
      really like.&nbsp; Like a good adventure game, it all makes sense, the flow works,
      and&nbsp; necessary information is given to the player in ways that make sense, are
      exciting, and move the plot along.&nbsp; I also introduced three new missions that use the
      citadel construction interface.&nbsp; These are going to be very cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think
      I got what I was shooting for: a game that gives me everything I wanted and is actually
