      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">Just to iron out an
      issue that has come up on many message boards and on various sites recently, the game will
      be done when both Interplay and Bioware are happy with it. Bioware may be sending us a
      &quot;final candidate&quot; soon. If they do, this means that they feel the game is the
      best it can be. At that time, Interplay and Bioware will both put it through the most
      objective evaluation we can to make sure that it really is the best it can be. If we
      aren't all 100 percent happy with it at that time, then we will need to make more changes
      and adjustments.<br>
      <br>
      This game is big. It's taken a lot of work to get it to where it is, and it'd be a waste
      to ship it early after all this work. Nobody is going to hold up the game if its fun and
      its clean -- but we aren't going to ship it until both those conditions are met. </p>

      chapter, though, you were basically free to do as you wished. In contrast, Return to
      Krondor, because of its more intense focus on storytelling, is now similar to a Final
      Fantasy game in that you direct the characters through a mostly-linear story with combat
      popping up to spice up the gameplay. </font></small></p>

      Krizan was hired to that end. We wanted Kim to have a clean slate, so that she could
      freely come to her own natural conclusions and create the dialogue accordingly. Hence, all

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">We're busting our asses
      to hit an upcoming milestone, and enjoying every minute of it ;) I've been working with
      our grandmaster art guru, Paul, on getting a whole slew of Shadar Logoth primitives which
      we have crafted up to par, and I'm starting to be pretty damn pleased with the way they
      are shaping up. I think SL has great potential to be one of the most graphically striking,
      areas of the game, and will offer some new gameplay experiences as well. It's a real
      challenge trying to plan and execute a city environment convincingly, but I think you'll
      all totally love the outcome.<br>
      <br>
      I've also been slaving away on a variant of the Forsaken's citadel, and made the painful
      decision to remove a rather large section for gameplay's sake last night, and thus have
      had little chance to sleep (translation: none), but I'm now more pleased with the level's
      flow and overall feel.<br>
      <br>
      I've got an A3d card here in the office, and have been playing with the patch for Unreal,
      and must say the effect is much better than I expected. There's a true spatial feeling
      that surpasses mere stereo sound, even on a normal 2 speaker setup. I think we may have
      access to some of the new Creative Live cards soon, and I'm anxious to hear them. These 3d
      audio cards are getting really cheap (even the brand new Live can be had for only 99$),
      and although I've never been a hardcore audio buff (a SB32AWE has been my choice for
      several years), I may have to pay more attention to that scene in coming months.<br>
      <br>
      Well, I've been here for almost a month now, and I'm getting pretty settled in, getting to
      know my teammates, etc. It's a good environment here at Legend, and everyone is more than
      willing to listen to new ideas, and most importantly, to work hard. </font></small></p>

      mention that we support serial link an modem to modem connections?. No. Ok, we do., There
      will be more on this shortly. Was up late last night playing the game. Made a grunt
      fighter, 18 /00 STR (that took a long time to get :) ) Adventured for like 5 hours, I just
      got to Chapter 2 ( I skipped most of chapter one, I've seen it a million times). Tip#2
      This may seem obvious, but to some it isn't. I know you like to save those
      potions/scrolls/wands for the &quot;big&quot; fights, and at the end of the game you
      usually never used them, and have a huge stockpile of them. In Baldur's Gate, you WILL be
      using them. There are several tough (read: very tough) fights in every chapter. There are
      enough wands etc. for you to be able to spread them around a bit. Some of the major fights
      have only been won by testers who use their items (makes sense).</font></small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">Although some aspects of
      Planescape Torment will be very familiar to AD&amp;D veterans, such as the traditional
      system of attributes (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and
      charisma), many of the gameplay elements in Torment will be as new as the setting. Like
      Fallout, Planescape Torment will be a very character driven game. In fact, instead of
      beginning the game in traditional AD&amp;D fashion by generating a first level Mage,
      Fighter, Paladin or other conventional character class, you are given a rather unique
      protagonist. The player's character in the game is an immortal who has, during his
      extended existence, acquired god-like abilities in virtually all of AD&amp;D's character
      classes. But there was a cost to your character's' immortality. In the past, whenever the
      character received wounds that would have killed him if not for his immortal status, he
      awakened some time after the incident in a state of amnesia, unaware of his former
      identity or abilities. As a result of this &quot;tormented&quot; existence, the player's
      character has acquired great abilities but he will be unable to use them until he becomes
      aware of his past and his former powers. He's also acquired a &quot;Frankenstein's
      Monster-ish&quot; profile of scars. No Fabio here.</font></small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">We killed a whole swak
      of bugs over the weekend. Over 400 bugs met their demise over the last 3 days. The #'s are
      as follows: 799 Active bugs (that's bugs pending and on peoples desks) 1061 Inactive (we
      say they are killed and Interplay is verifying) and 1317 Killed (dead ,dead, dead!).
      Needless to say we are making good headway. Something new I want to try is to post neat
      tips and tricks to playing BG. Tip1: Your first level mage is kinda weak and some say
      useless. Bah! I say. Try this trick. Memorize the spell grease (level 1 spell) and keep
      your mage in the back ranks. Equip a goodly amount of bows (or other ranged weapons). When
      a group of monsters approach, pause the game, launch that grease spell. The area of effect
      is pretty large, so watch out. Un-pause the game. All creatures in the area of effect slip
      and slide, movement is halved. It's pepper the bad guys time. It takes twice as long for
      them to get to you, ergo, you get twice the &quot;free&quot; ranged attacks. This works
      great with non- ranged enemies! More to come. </font></small></p>

      able to buy drinks at taverns? If so - will this effect the way they respond to a players

      <br>
      <strong>Yes, you can drink in the taverns. If you drink to excess, the character will
      suffer penalties to hit. </strong><br>
      <br>
      2) Will characters always walk around with weapons in the ready position? <br>
      <br>
      <strong>If you have the weapon equipped, then yes. Warriors have several &quot;quick
      weapon&quot; slots, and can leave one empty if they like. This will allow you to quickly

      have thought twice before committing to it,&quot; said Ragaini. &quot;The end result will

      pent. I think brad said he was using something close to a 200<pent pro> so this should work just
      fine. Please correct me if im wrong about brads home computer people. :) </font></p>

    that Tennis season is basically over I have a bit more time to make updates and play games
    in general. I just restarted my account on UO and that feels good to be back. I am looking
    forward to seeing the new add on. Anyway, EQ beta is kicked in and ready to rock and roll,
    Baldur's Gate is almost in our greedy little paws, and my Monkey is getting that warm
    feeling. Anyway, stay tuned for some goodies coming your way pilgrams. - <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a></small><br>
