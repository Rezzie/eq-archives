    <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Ok it's time to take the dive into the big boys that
    I saw at E3. After having seen all those other games everything started to kind of blend
    in with each other. Many of the games started to look the same and there wasn't much that
    really stuck out from the pack. Except for these games I am about to list off for you. So
    sit back, relax and get ready because these are the games I believe will kick our
    collective asses all over the place.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Ultima 9:</font><font color="#C0C0C0"><br>
    Plain and simple here....the graphics were 100% amazing. If Unreal took the limits of PC
    gaming to one height then Ultima 9 will surely be taking it to another. From what I saw
    the game was still early in development and definitely needs much tweaking. I talked to Ed
    Castillo for a while about this and he gave me some good food for thought. From what he
    showed me the graphics were literally earth shaking. He did things with lighting you can
    only dream about. Night and Day affects were awesome! But one of the best part is the
    physics model. He showed this cool sign as it swung gently in a breeze but then he hit a
    button and the breeze picked up and the sign started to flutter with sound affects. Then
    he hit another button and the sign was swinging like mad in an erratic pattern also...it
    didn't look fake at all. He said Rain storms will be in with strong winds and trees and
    leaves etc will blow as well as anything else that will be susceptible to winds. But to me
    the most shocking thing was seeing the coastline and watch the water and wave affects! But
    even better than that was seeing a ship for your first time....this thing was rocking with
    the waves in the most realistic way you'll ever see. Each wave would bring it up and down,
    and from side to side it swayed. If you stepped in, you began rocking with it almost
    giving a sense of sea sickness. He said the world is as large as any Ultima, including
    UO!!! If it's that big, this game could go down in history as the most visually amazing
    experience in the history of the Industry. With that said, character interaction was
    something I didn't get to see except him attacking a giant Crab. Combat looked very fun
    and very realstic. But he said that there will be plenty of character interaction in this
    game also but it wont be the kind we normally think of. It will be more graphically
    oriented. Meaning things you see will lead into things that are said...more like real
    life. Where in the old Ultima's you could read a dialogue tree that went into giant
    novels. This will be much different. The only problem I saw with the game was how things
    drew themselves into existence in the distance. I asked about fogging and he said they are
    still trying to figure out how to cover this up. I sure hope they figure a way out because
    it is a little distracting. Other than that, this game was probably the most visually
    amazing game I saw at the show. No matter if your hard Core Ultima fan or what, this game
    will leave you speechless after seeing it run. Personally I would rather have a more
    graphical approach rather than the old boring dialogue way. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Asheron's Call:<br>
    </font><font color="#C0C0C0">The last game I saw at the show proved to be the biggest
    shock. This game simply looks awesome without acceleration. Overall the interface was
    absolutely incredible! Just as good and maybe even better than EQ's was, which is hard to
    say because EQ's was damn good. Movement was very much like Ultima Underworld. And Combat
    was quite fun! I had the lead Designer walk me through some of it and show me some cool
    sights along the way until the Server went down. He also said beta testing was coming up
    very soon...and looking at the game I would say so also. Now with that all said, let me
    give a few remarks. The game looked damn good without acceleration but the ground and
    close ups still looked very grainy and pixelated. If this game had some acceleration life
    would be good. They were still very vague on that subject also saying that it might be
    added in the future. Right now they are looking to get the game out and into Beta testing
    before they think about adding 3D acceleration in it. Which at this point, it defenitely
    is good enough for prime time. So let's hope to see this very soon. I can honestly now say
    that I was impressed and that this game will now be on my list of upcoming favorites to
    keep an eye on.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Baldur's Gate:</font><font color="#C0C0C0"><br>
    Drumroll please.....you knew it was coming so here it is. I did get to play BG in depth
    boys and girls. And what I saw did not disapoint. For those people who thought hard core
    RPG's were far and few between think again. This is as hard core as you get. Graphics were
    very pretty. (For a lowly 2D game that is ;)) Character animation was smooth and the
    interface.....even smoother! Although the voices got so frustrating that I had to turn the
    damn things off. Character customization had everything you need and want. Great detail
    and easy interface. Really...after playing so much of it, there's nothing left to say
    except that it really is everything you see in those screenshots. It was just like playing
    Diablo except with some serious amounts of depth! Combat was awesome how you could pause
    it and figure out what to do next. And I HATE turn based combat. In this game however
    there will be a point where you defenitely need to use it especially when your party gets
    bigger. Dialogue is great and characters react very intelligently. At one point I got a
    little fiesty with one of the locals and one of the local Police came over and started
    fighting me. Of course since I was low level I died fairly fast. Also after playing it for
    a while I ran into 2 of the Bioware team. I forgot the other guys name but Kevin Craig was
    a great help and walked me through much of the interface, combat, and overall game. He
    also said that all those cool character portraits that you see in the game are actual
    paintings of all the Bioware members! So all those characters you see are Bioware boys and
    girls. The best thing is that Bioware will be releasing expansion packs for this beauty
    kind of like the module analogy for AD&amp;D. If you are into RPG's and if you come to
    this site who isn't? Then this is the game you have been waiting a long time for. Fallout
    never really turned me on...but this game got me warmer than swallowing Prozak like
    skiddles.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Everquest:<br>
    </font><font color="#C0C0C0">Saving the best for last. This game was everything UO was
    meant to be but wasn't. But it is an extreme departure from UO also. I played as much of
    this as possible as Brad could probably attest to. Believe me when I say a newbie could
    get into this game with no problem within moments after playing! That is how completely
    smooth the interface is. Everything is incredibly intuitive to navigate with. My first
    experience I actually ran into one of the programmers who was located at their San Diego
    servers. I played with absolutely no lag on a T3 connection. ;) The views you can use are
    great and you can change them completely on the fly as you go. Which in the case of going
    into town is very needed since they got the typical camera problem ala Tomb Raider etc
    when you went around corners etc. So you had to use a first person view much of the time
    in towns. One of the best things (And there were many) was the day and Night affects! Very
    smooth is the best way to describe the transition between night and day. And when it gets
    completely dark you had better not be outside without either Infravision or some sort of
    light sorce. The night affects could prove to be extremely frightfull when you are outside
    in the wilderness all by your lonesome! I played a Dark Elf Thief at first (Of all things)
    and boy did everyone not like me one bit. Jeez, whoever chooses to play one of these
    characters is going to have a serious inferiority complex afterwards...I promise. I had to
    get into my guild alone by sneaking through back alleys and finding secret doors. The only
    way I would have found my guild was by following one of the programmers. It was well
    hidden. He showed me how to train my character which is quick and efficient. Then he
    tossed a nice dagger my way and off we went to conquer the world...actually in my case to
    barely conquer a Rat. ;) And to be honest the Rat kicked my ass. :( So here I was, dead by
    a rats teeth, so I get ressurected back at the town entrence and the programmer writes me
    up and comes back for me. We hook back up and go out to find my dead rotting corpse (At
    the hands of a Rat mind you) and recover my items. When you loot bodies your character
    actually bends over to pick them up which is cool looking! It's also cool to sit down
    crosslegged at a campfire and just chat and check out the cool lighting affects of a Torch
    at night. This game seriously gave me some goosebumps...if there were any good looking
    models at Sony's Booth I would have been in heavan. There were also periods of loading
    time when it loaded new sections of the world...but they were fairly fast. Other gripes on
    my part are defenitely the Keyboard interface the the distance tracing and pop up affects.
    The Keyboard was a bitch! Compared to AC's easy mouse interface which acted much like
    Ultima Underworlds did, EQ's interface sucked like a bad hooker. You had to manouver with
    your keyboard and try to click on people while in the game. Trying to do combat like this
    was very frustrating. Imagine chasing a Snake for miles all the while trying to use the
    keyboard and click your mouse on the target!!!!This drove me crazy! I seriously hope this
    interface is fixed before they go beta because it really bothored the hell out of me. Also
    the Distance problems are something most games were having problems with. Trees that
    suddenly spring into existence on the horizon etc. When you get near the Castle Walls they
    draw themselves into existence much like Ultima's did. Hopefully these problems are fixed
    soon. Other than that this game is really, really ready for hard core beta testing. It was
    damn solid and played smooth. Needless to say, you guys are in for a big fat treat when
    this comes out! Also Sony was giving away free Kieth Parkison Posters which were good size
    and boy is it absolutely gorgeous! Actually hanging on my wall right now!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Other notable games:<br>
    </font><font color="#C0C0C0">I saw some Sword and Sorcery which looked fair, some Land's
    of Lore 3 which looked really early, and that's about it. Now Non RPG's I had a few
    favorites. But the one that stuck out the most was Half Life!! This game I want extremly
    badass after seeing it at the show! This had by far the most advanced AI ever seen in a
    game! One of the TF guys showed me some stuff you would not believe. This game is
    seriously going to be a winner. Also Omikron looked very sweet and is something for you
    guys to watch out for. Thanks for reading and we'll have some more goods your way soo! -<a
