    <p align="left">I know I said that all sites get added, so why are
    their rules for getting your site into the ring? Well, I just wanted to outline a few
    obvious things. First, if you want to get your site included, you must have a completed
    site up and running. I've had a few sites put into the queue in the past that were far
    from being complete. Second, I ask that you put the navigation HTML that I send you in the
    email, or if you don't want to put it somewhere on your site because you believe it will
    cramp your style, please add a link back to this site in your links section or somewhere.
    and remember, you can put the navigation HTML, or image map anywhere on your site, you can
    even have it on a separate page of it's own. Just make sure you let people know. If you
    refuse to put the HTML or the button (see link below) on your page, you are defeating the
    purpose of this ring and your site will be removed. That is all I ask for this great
    service. Thanks all!</p>
