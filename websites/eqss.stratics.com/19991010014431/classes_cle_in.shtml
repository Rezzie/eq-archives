So you want to be one of the healers of Norrath. Listen well and heed my
words faithful one, for the journey is long and hard - but infinitely
rewarding! Clerics are one of the most exciting and playable classes in
the land of Norrath, possessing healing and offensive spells that make
them a cornerstone of any well-balanced group, as well as being able to
wield blunt weapons and wear almost any armor they please. These unique
abilities allow the Cleric to hit hard as well as take a beating, and
live on to fight another day. In addition, Clerics are granted abilities
that allow them to take on undead foes at levels that would have a
fighter at the same level fleeing for his life! Whether your style is
group or solo play, the Cleric is equipped to deal with the perils of
Norrath like no other class.

To be honest, a Cleric is not as effective at solo play as the heavier
hitting pure fighter classes. This is because round for round, a Cleric
is going to have a harder time dealing consistent damage to kill high
level monsters, as well as having fewer hit points to survive the
vicious counter-attacks. Clerics can dish out a beating with their
spells, but their most powerful damage spells take a while to cast -
leaving them vulnerable to a well placed hit from their foe - and drain
large amounts of mana. Take it from me, the one time you're guaranteed
to need a quick heal is right after draining all of your mana to blast
your opponent down to an inch of his life! Additionally, while there are
plenty of blunt weapons that do a fair amount of damage, only the most
powerfully enchanted mace is going to keep up with a two-handed claymore
in the hands of an experienced barbarian warrior. The one caveat to this
is the fact that Clerics are able to wear all kinds of armor, including
full plate. Find yourself a powerful set of armor and wade into the
fray, well protected from harm. This is an advantage none of the other
spellcasters can claim!
<p>
As with many other classes, Clerics come into their own in a group. With
just one fighter to distract the monsters and keep your hands free for
healing and support, you'll find that your tank can live well 'nigh
forever battling against monsters far above your own levels. And your
offensive spells are potent enough to deal the decisive kill at the end
of the battle.
<p>
One drawback to the Cleric is they have to deal with the worst of the
money situation of both fighters and spellcasters. On the one hand, you
need to save all the gold and platinum you can to afford the spells you
want in the next rank. On the other, if you don't get some protection
covering those scrawny bones, your gonna be soup. So it's especially
important to keep a tight fist on your money supply, and never waste a
single copper chip. Come level fourteen you're going to want to spend 50
platinum to get all those great spells - and if you're not careful,
you'll be broke as a milkmaid!

If you've played EverQuest before, you know that race plays a minor role
in your character's strengths and weaknesses. The beauty of EverQuest is
that any race/class combination, if played smartly and creatively, can
be successful. Blame this on 989, not the players - they have designed a
system that enhances character creation and allows you to play what you
want, instead of forcing you to pick the "best" class in order to keep
up. That said, the races that miss out on Clerics are the Barbarians,
Half-Elves, Ogres, Trolls, and Wood Elves (Ogres and Trolls should check
out the Shaman class).
<p>
Wisdom is the driving skill for Clerics, as it determines the amount of
mana you get. Strength is also important, especially if you are dreaming
of your character crusading against evil with platemail, tower shield,
and war hammer. You can't wear the armor if you can't carry it!
Otherwise, adjust your attributes as you see fit and wade into the fray!

If you've played one character under level four, you've pretty much
played them all. Life for a rank newbie in Norrath is pretty much the
same no matter what class or race you're in. For a while your existence
will consist of killing everything you can find in the newbie gardens
(usually snakes, bats, rats, and other unimpressive fare) and selling
whatever loot you can. You will start out with Strike and Light Healing
spells - scribe and memorize them immediately, and begin practicing your
magical abilities. Use Strike to finish your opponents off, which will
give you the practice you need for timing your spells between your
opponent's attacks. Cast light healing as necessary - you will find that
with your healing abilities you will last longer on the battlefield than
your non-Cleric friends! The five practice points you acquire for
completing your guild quest will be best spent in one-handed blunt, as
that's what you'll be using to do the majority of your damage for quite
a while.
<p>
When you can afford it purchase Courage. When cast, this will boost your
AC and HP, and at low levels is a tremendous boon. Unless you absolutely
MUST have one of the other Rank 1 spells, save your money until you get
to level five, which has some more powerful spells.
<p>
Clerics gain new spell rankings slower than Magicians and Wizards. This
is to balance the Clerics' ability to use blunt weapons and armor.
Therefore levels one to four are more of the same stuff. For maximum
experience you'll want to stay away from parties until at least level
three and depending on your personal inclination even until level five.
At level five you'll want to purchase Light Healing, Holy Armor, Gate,
and Ward Undead. Your prowess on the battlefield will have improved
quite a bit and these additional spells will help. But just because you
have Light Healing, don't put that Minor Healing away! Light Healing
takes significantly longer to cast as well as using up quite a bit more
mana than Minor Healing, so you'll want to keep both of them memorized
and available.
<p>
Now that you have Ward Undead, try teaming up with a fighter and go
undead hunting. Let the fighter take the damage while you crush the
undead fiend with Ward. When you're comfortable, try fighting the weaker
undead creatures alone. Look for parties to join and practice your group
skills. Buy Lull and start taking on goblin, orc, or gnoll camps one
monster at a time.

Life changes dramatically at level nine. At this level you gain access
to your first real damage spell - Word of Pain. WoP deals damage to all
the monsters in a small circle around you, and can clear a battlefield
in a hurry. WoP will draw quite a bit of mana at level nine so be
careful, but you'll find it just the thing you're looking for to deal
damage while still being the party healer. Some other important spells
level nine brings are Center, a powerful buff spell, Root, which will
stop an enemy dead in its tracks, and Soothe, an improved version of
Lull. Root is handy to stop a fleeing foe from rounding up his friends
while you attack his back, as well as keeping a mummy in place while you
pound it from a safe distance with Ward Undead. Soothe works the same as
Lull, just better, and is well worth the upgrade. And Center is Courage
part II - a much-improved version that no fighter in your party should
be without.

From nine to fourteen you'll be much more powerful, and well equipped to
explore more challenging (and rewarding!) places. You and your party can
try out Crushbone proper rather than skulking about the camps at the
entrance, and Black Burrow trains won't mean an instant death anymore.

Soon you'll be to level fourteen, which is the shining level for a
Cleric. You can now cast Healing and watch that HP bar climb climb
climb, while Smite is a sorely needed replacement for the now useless
(except for luring!) Strike. You'll also have access to Expulse Undead -
and if you thought Ward Undead was incredible, you haven't seen anything
yet! Paired up with Expulse is Invisibility to Undead - the perfect
complement to an adventure in the undead dungeons. Enjoy your new powers
and abilities - you are well on your way to becoming a master Cleric!

A Cleric can be one of the most rewarding classes to play in a group.
When adventuring with your comrades, you are in charge of that most
precious commodity - life. It is your sworn duty to keep your
compatriots alive at any cost - lonely is the Cleric who can't master
the ability of keeping a close eye on the health of his fellows while
closely following the battle at hand. A well-played Cleric makes friends
anywhere she pleases, has no trouble finding a group, and is never
without a helping hand. The unsuccessful Cleric - well, he might as well
hang up his hat and swear off the holy path.
<p>
One of the key skills you'll need to master as a Cleric is the best use
of your abilities to help the group. For the Cleric there are three key
roles for you to play:
<blockquote>
Healing and Combat Support:<div>
This is what being a Cleric is all about, and is the reason many choose
not to follow the healer's path. If you don't see the excitement, value,
and fun in being the person your comrades depend on to keep them
fighting, a Cleric's life is not for you. In addition to the obvious
healing, Cleric's have several powerful "buff" spells that increase hit
points and armor class, provide resistance to certain types of attacks,
and can cure ailments such as disease and blindness. Combat support also
includes using spells such as Lull or Soothe to pinpoint the exact foes
you will fight (or allow safe passage through a treacherous zone!), Root
to stop a fleeing monster dead in its tracks, and Invigor to restore
waning stamina when the battle drags on a bit too long. It's also the
act of keeping on eye on your surroundings and watching for potential
trouble during battle. Your name will go down in your partners little
black books if you are the one to spot the King of the Minotaurs
sneaking up on your fighters during battle!
<p>
Spell Damage:<div>
Sometimes the combat is going particularly well, or your fighters are
dodging and ducking blows like ballet dancers (maybe because of all
those buff spells you've cast on them!). This is the time to survey the
situation and see what you can do to help cause some damage. If you're
fighting multiple enemies, a well placed Word of Pain might be the
ticket to evening the odds, or perhaps you'd like to flex a little
muscle and take down that Mummy in a minute with Ward Undead. Remember,
though, it's always wise to practice restraint with combat spells, or
all too soon you'll know what it feels like to have used all your mana
to crush your foe, only to have nothing left to heal your bruised and
weakened fighters when a wandering monster attacks.
<p>
Melee Damage:<div>
At low levels, the damage you can inflict on monsters with regular
hand-to-hand combat is on par with the other fighter levels, and
therefore will make a difference in the battle. As you progress up the
experience ladder and begin facing tougher and more advanced battles,
this isn't the case, so only step into the fray when there's absolutely
nothing better for you to do. There's nothing wrong with sitting down
and meditating in the middle of battle - your friends will appreciate
your forethought in recovering a few bars rather than lightly tapping a
Crusader with your mace when his friends show up and start swinging!

<div>
Finally, here's a list of some helpful pointers, ideas, and concepts
that will help you make your way in Norrath, and become a Cleric that
Bards will sing tales of long after your passing!
<p>
If you find yourself alone in Norrath, the best things to fight are
Undead. As a Cleric you have a natural ability to best these fiends from
the netherworld, and there are several Cleric-only spells in your
arsenal such as Ward, Expulse, Spook, and Sense Undead, that you'll be
able to use with great effect. Solo'ng undead is also a good way to earn
money and XP - you'll be able to go face-to-face with undead at levels a
pure fighter type would shy away from.
<p>
Save your money! Your third rank spells will cost on average five
platinum each - a small fortune in Norrath's depressed economy. Until
you get to around twentieth level, being able to afford both the spells
and the weapons and armor you want will be one of your greatest
challenges. After twenty, you can look forward to a little leeway, as
you'll be able to fight monsters that will give much more money and
valuable loot, while the price of your spells will not keep up in
relation to your money making ability.
<p>
As a Cleric you've got the easiest way to gain friends and allies in
Norrath - use it! When you see a hapless soul stumbling away from a
monster, help that person out! Heal him up and watch the tide of battle
turn. Or offer your assistance to fellow travelers when the world is
swarming with plague rats or other disease carrying vermin. When all is
said and done you'll have made a valuable friend and ally; in Norrath,
you can never have too many friends.
<p>
In battle, your eyes should be checking your comrades HP more than your
own. If everything is going right, your fighters should be taking the
damage while you're on the sidelines playing support. In a long battle,
remember to Meditate between casting heals - at Level 11 you'll recover
enough mana to cast a Light Heal every 2-3 rounds. And that makes a huge
difference.

Just like any other spellcaster, you'll have a hard time working your
craft if an Orc is belting you. Also, some monsters take offense at your
healing and turn quickly to attack you. Make sure your party members
realize they need to keep you out of direct fire if they want to benefit
from your healing - if they know it's a matter of their life and death,
they'll be sure to Taunt more effectively!
<p>
In a party, keep your fighters in tip-top shape between battles as well
as during. When the fighting is over, make sure all your fighters are at
full or near full health before recovering your own mana. Also be ready
to apply Center, Holy Armor, Courage, or whatever other buff spells you
have available as soon as your teammate signals readiness. It only takes
one unexpected run in with a fierce monster to learn this lesson of
readiness well.
<p>
Lull (or Soothe) and Strike is your friend! At a monster camp, control
the pace and frenzy of the battle by selectively Soothing or Lulling
certain linked monsters, then Striking from a distance the remaining
monster(s) you want to tackle. Repeat as necessary until the camp is
empty. This evens the odds and allows even a party of just two (you and
your fighter!) to handle dangerous areas.
Divine Aura grants you 30 seconds of invulnerability when cast. You can
move while invulnerable, but you cannot cast spells or attack. 30
seconds is a LONG time when you're being chased down by a ravaging horde
of ghouls or when you're providing a getaway for your compatriots. Learn
it and use it!
<p>
Practice all of your spells you will be using in combat, and have a good
understanding of their casting times, duration, and effect. When you're
trying to get that decisive Expluse Undead in on the bashing, crushing,
and slashing Greater Skeleton timing is everything!
Be sure to practice both one-handed and two-handed blunt skills
regularly as you progress through the levels. Because you must hit
creatures that give you experience to raise a melee skill, it gets very
difficult to raise skills once you've neglected them for a few levels
(try hitting that Level 20 Gnoll with a two-handed blunt skill of 3!).
When you do find that Magical Dwarven two-handed Warhammer, you'll want
to be able to use it.
