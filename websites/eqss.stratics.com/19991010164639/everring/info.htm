    <p>The EverRing was created in hopes to connect the community of
    EverQuest together. This is only possible with support from you - the viewer (and
    webmaster of an EQ site). If you have an EverQuest site out there, and want more traffic,
    or even if it is a popular site, add it to the queue, as all sites will be accepted! If
    you wish to join, go to the join section and fill out the form. Your site will than be
    added to the queue and I will soon come to add it and I will email you the necessary HTML,
    as well as instructions for modifying it for your site, you need to place on your page so
    that everyone can navigate through the EverRing smoothly and not hit any 'dead ends'. I
    have great hopes for this, of course with your help. If you do not wish to place the large
    HTML fragment, or graphic, on your site, then there is a miniscule button that you can
    place anywhere on your site, which launches a separate viewing window for viewers to surf
    the webring without having to leave your page. Interested? Fill out the <a
    href="unsaved:///join.htm">Join form</a> and that's all you have to do! Enjoy.</p>
