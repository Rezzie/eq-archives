Lot's of spells similar to the existing ranger Call of Fire, Call of Sky and Jolting Blades spells appeared on Test.<br />
<br />
The thing is, I can't see rangers getting 25 new level 55 spells with POP, so I suspect they are mislabelled. Could this be the fix to all the &quot;poison is useless&quot; complaints?<br />

<br />
 Edit:<br />
<br />
So you don't have to fiddle around to get the basic idea, each poison is a 15 minute &quot;buff&quot; that allows you to proc an effect (like ranger Call of Sky, sk Vamp touch, pally Divine Might, etc.)<br />
<br />
The effects are as follows:<br />
They're 15 minute spells that add procs that will do several things:<br />
<br />
Confine - decrease movement (max 55%)<br />
Corruption - decrease hp by 55, dot for 66/tic over 5 tics - 385 total<br />
Dip Resist - lower all resists (max 10)<br />
Destroy Mind - reduce mana (max 60 per tic, for 5 tics)<br />
Molten Silver - 175 dd<br />
Remiss - lowers hate (max 500)<br />
Sluggish - lowers hate (max 110), lowers dex (max 120)<br />
Strike - 75 dd<br />
System Concussion - 75dd, stun (0.0 secs)<br />
Vein Rot - dot for 36hp/tic over 15 tics - 540 total<br />
Waste - lower dex (max 60), lower hate (max 110), lower str (max 120<br />
<br />
<br />
Over all, very kickass. I'm glad someone has been listening. Let's see how exactly everything works, but it looks good. Lozoria Shinkicker<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_KayleighDrake</div><div class="date">07-24-02, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy cow. It's exactly what some of us were talking about.<br />
<br />
There's a buff, Strike Poison II, 10 minute duration<br />
<br />
Then there's a spell, with NONE as casters, which is what procs list. Does 75 hp of damage against poison resist.<br />
<br />
There seems to be a correlation - buff and proc, buff and proc, down the line.<br />
<br />
Most of the level 2's last 10 minutes, and the level 3's seem to last 15 minutes but I didn't check them all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Strike does damage (Strike 2 and 3 do 75 points. Odd)<br />
<br />
Destroy mind 2 decreases mana by 30 per tick, and adds poison counters, 5 tick duration. (DM3 is 60 per tick)<br />
<br />
Vein Rot 2 is 24/tick DoT for 90 seconds. VR3 is 36/tick for 90 seconds. (360 dmg total and 540 total)<br />
<br />
Corruption 2 does 35, then 42/tick for 5 ticks.  Corr3 is 55 and 65/tick for 5 ticks.<br />
<br />
Molten Silver 2 does 125 DD to undead against magic resist. MS3 is 175.<br />
<br />
Dip Resist 2 drops all resists by 5 for 5 ticks. DR3 drops them by 10. (Both are hard to cure.) No idea how this will stack with other debuffs but I suspect it was designed to stack.<br />
<br />
Confine 2 is a 41%-55% snare lasting one minute. Confine 3 reads the same. (odd differences that I don't understand)<br />
<br />
Sluggish 2 reduces dex by 30-90, and also reduces hate (must be a counterbalance) lasting 1.2 minute. Slug3 is 60-120 DEX. Can you say anti-flurry? Lasts up to 3 minutes at level 60.<br />
<br />
System Concussion 2 is a 50 point DD and a stun. SC3 ups the damage to 75.<br />
<br />
Waste 2 increases hate (?), decreases strength by 30-90. Much the same as Sluggish.<br />
<br />
And what may be the most interesting one of all: Remiss<br />
<br />
Remiss 2 decreases hate by 500<br />
Remiss 3 reads the same right now.<br />
<br />
A hate reducing proc? I'm speechless.<br />
<br />
We're making assumptions about these, but it sure looks consistent to me.<br />

<br />
I will admit that I've never been fond of the contact proc buff idea for poisons, and I am curious as to how this will be shoehorned into the current system.<br />
<br />
If this is a poison fix, I'm curious as to whether these will result from new recipes, or whether these effects will be retrofitted to existing poisons.  If they will result from new recipes, then perhaps the hunt will be on for Testers to find them! <br />

<br />
(&amp;amp; strike on page 2)<br />
<br />
you'll see them as seperate spells actually. i don't see why rangers should get these poisons though....<br />
<br />
one thing I noticed about Dip Resist: Lucy says 'Resist: N/A', which I assume means it's unresistable....not bad with a 30 second additional debuff to help land slow, cripple, etc.if you look at<br />

OTOH maybe it's done that way on test to give an easy way to test out the effects - dummy them as ranger spells and cast them to try them out, then change them to go live.<br />

Also, we will have less control over when to use it in a fight.<br />

<br />
Looks like most of the DD poisons there are reduced.  I know Mind Melt does somethin' to the lines of 555 at level 60.  I look at a 75dd to 100 dd proc as not much.  Then again, I don't understand the system of *proc buffin'*.  Does this mean that these poison effects will kick in a random amount of times until that period of 10-15 minutes expires?  I'm really not sure.  Someone please give me a better explanation.<br />
<br />
I also remember readin' on one of the sites that Verant is very interested in expandin' the poison application.  Meanin', that Rogues would be able to apply weapons for other people.  If that happens in PoP, I see a financial horizon for Rogues in the near future.<br />

<br />
That's exactly what it means. <br />
<br />
Mind melt is 555 damage, once.<br />
<br />
New poison is, let's say, a 100 point damage, but you can proc many times over the 10 or 15 minute period with one application of the poison. Personally I find this better on a number of levels - mostly that I'm not starting off the fight with a high-agro action of doing 555 damage.<br />
<br />
There are buffs that give you a proc, where you did not have one before. Paladins have a spell they cast on themselves - when active it gives their weapons a undead-only proc. (This is in addition to whatever proc the weapons may have had before.)<br />
<br />
The theory is that these poisons work the same way. You apply the poison to the blade, and the poison will affect the target at random times. (I.e. you &quot;cast&quot; the &quot;buff&quot; on yourself, and now your weapons proc the effect on your target)<br />

I like the 555 damage once ordeal.  But here's the thin' I've always said about Rogues.  Rogues are supposed to be deadly...but subtle.  Poison is supposed to be subtle.  Givin' 555 damage and gettin' the agro and mobs attention in the beginnin' isn't subtle.  Matter of fact it's quite obvious.  Big figures SOUND nice, but if you have 10-15 minutes of poison, it's worth the effort into investin' into poison.  Furthermore, you don't have to worry about reapplication right after a kill because you got 10 minutes of the stuff, so it's TRULY coated.  And it also makes AA skills like Purge Poison and Poison Mastery....USEFUL.<br />
<br />
Personally, I rather do the subtle damage but constantly than just one good blow, so it sounds good.  But what I'm tryin' to figure is what determines if the poison lands and how often it does.  Would that be dex, the poison itself, the amount of hits you land, or the person's skill in poison application.  I think tha the latter would seem much useful.  If this is all true, it's gonna be vicious.<br />

<br />
I'm not sure I entirely follow you here.<br />
<br />
How often: well it's the same question as &quot;how often will my weapon proc&quot;? There's probably someone who knows the numbers but I don't. It is well known that the higher your DEX the more often you proc, so a high dex will make your poison &quot;go off&quot; more often.<br />
<br />
If it lands: Only thing that would matter here is the poison resistance of the target creature. (Exception: the  undead DD poison is based on magic resistance) <br />

I haven't really seen most of the proc buffs that Paladins have and thus, don't understand it that well.  The reason I asked was because with the way it's presented there are so many radical possibilities.  It could be based on Dex or hell, it could kick in and out like a Bard song, although that could be a bit too extreme.  But either way, it sounds like a breakthrough that's finally needed.<br />

<br />
The weapons I currently use (Crystaline Spider Fang and Smoldering Brand) proc a good couple of times within a 10-15 minute period. Not sure exactly, but would not be surprised if it is half a dozen. I am level 32 with a DEX of 127.<br />
<br />
If the poisons worked as a similar proc, and therefore worked off your DEX and level, then this wouldn't be too bad. I would get half a dozen procs in a 15 minute dose of poison. I could live with that. Could REALLY live with that if I could poison both weapons  <br />
<br />
Again, this is assuming this all goes live anyway</div></div><hr />

<br />
I typically see weapon procs multiple times during a fight with a blue exp mob (at level 60, with appropriately high dex) so I think the &quot;value&quot; is there, but of course that depends how hard it is to make the poison in the first place.<br />
<br />
Of course Murphy states you'll never get a proc when you really need one.<br />
<br />
As for two weapons, spells like this give you a chance to proc on both weapons, so you are effectively poisoning both.  <br />

Weapon procs are entirely different from this system.<br />
<br />
A) You can only have one proc up, so dont expect this to stack with Boon of the Garou, as the lifetap proc will overwrite your poison here.<br />
<br />

I too suspect that this will be made to work like potions do.  Which also means that they can make them charged.  The only downside is that this means Apply Poison won't actually do anything anymore unless they come up with a new way to implement it, such as faster &quot;cast&quot; time on the vial, or like a channeling effect when activating poisons.<br />
<br />
And yes, I'f my knowledge of spell procs is correct, one casting of the buff will cause your mainhand, offhand AND ranged attacks to all proc the effect.  But don't expect to be able to have more than one up at a time.</div></div><hr />

Verant has the ability to modify the % chance a proc will go off, but your Dexterity increases that % chance. It's that simple.<br />
<br />
I'm not 100%, but I imagine it's the same way with Buffs that give you procs, IE, they can modify the chance to Proc. Dex may not increase the chance for a Buff Proc though, you'd have to ask Paladins and Rangers if they've tested that.<br />

<br />
I do not think that Apply Poison only applies to the application of that poison on a weapon.  If they modified that percentage with Apply Poison playin' a significant role, then the whole process would be interestin' and the AA Poison Mastery would definitely be useful.<br />
<br />
It also means that if it is truly proc buffin', then it should be absolutely no problem for Rogues to &quot;poison&quot; other people's weapons.  If they do that and base it on the Apply Poison skill, then that could mean that other classes may have a default % in which it kicks in whereas Rogues have that percentage affected by the Apply Poison skill.  <br />
<br />
What I mean is this.  Take a enchantresswho has her piercer poisoned. You can have the results based on <br />
<br />
A) Default % of &quot;proc&quot; since they didn't apply the poison<br />
<br />
B) A 1/4 or 1/3 value of the Rogue who applied the poison's Apply Poison added to that default %<br />
<br />
Whereas a Rogue who applies his/her poison to his/her weapon will have maybe 1/2 or a whole value added to that default %.  That would certify that Rogue's are TRULY the masters of poisonin'.  It would be how like other classes use arrows well but nowhere as near as Rangers and so on.<br />

<br />
However, farming components for these poisons again and again is going to get old fast =(<br />
<br />
I only wish they made the potions unlimited charges but requiring a reagent in inventory to cast.<br />
<br />
For example, to apply liquid silver to your weapon you need a zombie skin, or a stack of zombine skins etc.. in your bag that are not consumed, but it wont cast if you dont have the reagents in inventory. <br />
<br />
This makes it so you have to at least get the reagents once, but then you dont have to keep going back after you have :<br />
<br />
a) combined all the proper components into your Poison Vial and created the final product with the Effect<br />
<br />
b) kept a required reagent(s) in inventory while applying this poison<br />
<br />
If they make them 1 shots that you have to farm constantly and fill up your bags for it, well, i probly wont put too much effort into it especially considering the resist rate on poison , and the fact that the poison debuffs for necro class check against poison resist to land and agro worse than tash... perhaps if they did a word wide reduction of poison resists much like the velious patch to magic/fire/cold resists, it would be a lot more handy.<br />

Will be interesting to see if rogue poison will be something that can be handed out to others; because if it is the shammies are gonna go off the deep end because of the absurd utility of those from a large scale perspective.

<br />
currently: to do 'standard rogue damage', you show up and backstab. If you want to stand out, you can do the farming greens/making vials thing, and get some nice effects that are situationally useful.<br />
<br />
with this change: to do 'standard rogue damage', you have to fiddle about buying stuff from merchants, right clicking 40,000 times to raise skills, lugging a bunch of components round, whatever. Everyone has to do that, and there is no way for anyone to do any more to stand out.<br />
<br />
Just one more sign that the current EQ team has absolutely no clue as to what makes a game fun and interesting. I _don't want_ powers that makes farming low blues 2% faster. I want skills that make a heroic recovery from a chaotic overpull in a mad dungeon crawl _possible_.<br />
<br />
Reminder to verant: there are users sitting in front of the screen, who need things to do. Taking the decision of when/if to apply poison out of the user's hands and making it a random proc is a big step backwards.<br />

<br />
You're assuming that they would remove the existing poisons.<br />
<br />
There's no reason why poison making can't create both the existing poisons, and new poisons that act as a procbuff.<br />
<br />
I personally think that it would be quite cool to be able to poison my weapons so that it fires more than once.  Or even better, poison a party member's weapons.<br />
<br />
For those who don't want to make poisons, there's this nifty new thing called the bazaar, where people who do make 'em can sell 'em.<br />
<br />
You're correct in assuming that if this goes active, then rogues will more or less be 'expected' to be poisonbuffed.<br />
<br />
How feasible that will be will depend on the availability of the components.<br />

<br />
I don't know how you can think it's anythin' but good.  Finally, somethin' to revolutionize the art of poisonin' that is supposed to be one of the definin' traits of bein' a Rogue.  You can't think of anythin' good from it?  I can think of a few.<br />
<br />
1) Multiple poison chances: How many people have invested time and money into a poison, finally made and applied it, get all excited to use that poison only to have it resisted.  All that time seems lost.  In a fight there are times where you DON'T have time to reach for another poison.  A 10 mintue duration means you have 10 minutes to hit more than one creature with a poison as opposed to a one shot 50/50 chance.<br />
<br />
2) Time Consumption: You know how frustratin' it is for some people to have to poison, hit, wait for mob to drop, and then poison again?  Personally I can land at least 3 poisons in a fight but some other people can't.  And when it comes to certain mobs where you can't sit, Applyin' Poison could mean your life as well as others.  10 minutes is 10 minutes of chances.  I'd take that over one dose any day.<br />
<br />
3) AA Skill - Poison Mastery: If this change does occur, Poison Mastery will actually be USEFUL.  When I first saw that we received Poison Mastery I was upset.  I thought Throwin' Mastery would have been more useful considerin' the annoyance of poisonin' at times.  This change will give Poison Mastery a reason to be useful. The point of poison mastery is that you ne'er fail at applyin' a poison, you shave up to 50% of time in application, and reduce the chance of failure in poison makin' by up to 50%.  End result: More poison chances for ev'ryone.<br />
<br />
4) Possibility of Poisonin' Weapons for Others - Imagine that.  With AA Skill it's e'en better.  Goin' around and poisonin' your groups weapons. It can realistically shave a mob down to size.  It can also make battles a lot less intense for mobs with HIGH MR.  Most mobs and PC characters relatively have higher MR than PR because Magic is more expected than poison.<br />
<br />
5) The Deceit Factor - If someone's poisoned in a fight out of nowhere, who are they gonna blame?  I've been a strong believer that Rogues are one of the deadliest classes because a person can ne'er know what to expect from a Rogue.<br />
<br />
 I can go on and on about the positive factors of this change, especially if they keep the old poisons.  The old ones could be used by and for Rogues only while the new ones can be applied to other classes, just like how classes have Self buffs and Group buffs.  I'm really lookin' forward to this. It would make a lot of people happy and it would really change a lot of horizons in EQ.<br />

<br />
1. I don't like the idea of applying for others. This makes rogues in to a walking poison factory for your tanks:<br />
<br />
Tank_1: Hey rogue, apply poison for me. I'm twinked out with 255 DEX so I'm better at landing it then you.<br />
<br />
Nah, I don't think so. I've said it before, if you're going to allow rogues to poison other weapons, then make the Apply Poison skill affect the chance of proccing. <br />
<br />
2. These changes will only help if they are ADDED to the current system, and not in replacement of it.<br />
<br />
Cleric_1: Rogue, slow that mob.<br />
Rogue_1: I'm trying, but my poison won't proc!<br />
Cleric_1: The tank is dead and I am hurting!<br />
Rogue_1: Yay! it finally procced!<br />
<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.<br />
<br />
Someone suggested earlier that by adding an ingredient to all the poison recipes would be what makes them the buff proc as oppose to the first hit type of thing. That would be good, as it gives us more options.<br />
<br />
3. Stackable poisons in your inventory isn't going to happen and shouldn't happen! Assuming these changes go in, a rogue could carry 1 stack of spider venom sacs, 1 stack of vials and 1 stack of suspensions and be &quot;buffed&quot; with Weaken I poison for 150 minutes! Come on. That's great. Add a stack of snake venom sacs and you could &quot;buff&quot; another 150 minutes of Inject I! 300 minutes of &quot;buffed&quot; poisoning with only 4 inventory slots taken up. Please. That rocks as is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seriously doubt that applyin' poison for other people's weapons would make Rogues a poison factory. That's like sayin' that Shaman's duty is to make potions for people because they're obliged to.  Nah, I don't think that will happen and if it does best believe I'm gonna have someone get me supplies or stuff.<br />
<br />
I agree with the Apply Poison factor that you've stated and I actually posted my comments on that so check that out and let me know what you think.  Personally, Apply Poison right now...sucks.  It really doesn't have a purpose accordin' to most people and I believe that it affects your chances of landin' a poison although that hasn't been proven.   But yes, Apply Poison has to play a factor in the outcome of poison success.  I mean, you can easily poison a level 1 and have 'im take on somethin' a bit higher for PL purposes if Dex is a factor.  There has to be a ratio as to what causes poison to connect and I believe that Dex will be a way too easy means in landin' poisons.<br />
<br />
 I can live with or without stackable.  With is overkill.  Without is reasonable but e'en with poisons the way they are right now, I carry a bag ready and another bag of ingredients for my battles.  So it's not really necessary to stack 'em if this system comes out.<br />

I've met a vast amount of 50+ Rogues that have their poisonin' at 20 or 36 or some low number.  A lot of people are not into it because they think that the damage output that Rogues do is enough.  I think this will help get people who are into poisonin' in a large way.  But it's like any skill, it takes desire and interest in order to really try it and stick with it.

<br />
What I personally would like to see is ofcourse the poisons being stackable, but mostly the components and how they're obtainable. <br />
A lot of rogues already know the utter thrill of farming No hope moss, heartsting venom sacks or whatever. Besides the fact that the old poisons wasn't that incredible and long lasting anyway.<br />
<br />
I also would like to see a few changes with our AA class skill, Poison Mastery. We could all agree that for now it's been relatively useless and only made difference in apply time, so in order to make is more significant for all rogues - you could for an example make it have innate effect on the efficiency of these poisons.<br />
<br />
For an example, having 1 skill level into PM would make the usual DD at 75 to 100 instead. Having 2 skill levels would make it 125 and 3rd level would be 150. (Perhaps overpowered yes, could just go in lower numbers. It's the concept.)<br />

<br />
That way people at the appropriate levels can make XP while farming their practice(and useful!) components, and people who would have to farm greens can just shell out cash instead.<br />

<br />
<br />
No, my assumption is that these poisons will be made from a brand new set of components sold on some newly added merchants, and the products combined to make stackable poisons. Because these are really just potions, casting a buff spell when clicked on, the stacking issues affecting the old poison system won't apply.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what Verant did with alchemy - they listened to peoples complaints about the old alchemy system, and instead of tweaking it, scrapped it completely and replaced it with something worse.<br />
<br />
Without poisons, rogues do 1.4 times warrior damage. With poisons, rogues will do 1.5 times warrior damage for a week or two, until warriors get another upgrade to restore the status quo.<br />

This is only the fact if you think that using poisons will be REQUIRED for you - which it isn't. Noone will force you to use them. Unless of course I am right in saying that you fear that poisons will be expected of rogues - both in pickup groups and raids.</div></div><hr />

What would you say if you grouped with a shaman who refused to buff the group?<br />

If poisons are hideously expensive, rare drops from greens, or non-stackable, there's no problem. But if, as I suspect, they will be easy to get, then they will be mandatory.<br />

<br />
Poisons aren't like Peridots in which you can go to your nearest Peridot vendor and buy stacks of them and be on your merry way.  Look at it this way.  There are 4 main poison vendors in NORRATH and I'm not includin' the ones in Fironia Vie and Thurgadin for a reason.  And mind you, notice that they're all spread out in far and remote places.  I WISH I could go and buy suspensions in Neriak but that ain't happenin'.  <br />
<br />
It won't become mandatory because you're dealin' with an array of combinations for different effects and different situations.  And it's not like people are gonna give cash gems to Rogues to help fund for poisonin'.  As for the Shaman comment, that's MANA.  That's NOT ingredients.  Two different subjects for two different thin's.  But ya know what?  If these thin's go live and my guild decides to make it mandatory by some freak miracle, I'm gonna make sure they provide funds for poisons.<br />

Not really a good example.<br />
<br />
Better examples would be clerics not having peridots on them, or shamans not doing alchemy or an ench not casting clarity on himself...<br />
<br />
IF groups expect rogues to use those proccing poisons, rogues should be granted the same amount of gems that clerics get... to cover the cost.</div></div><hr />

The net result is not zero - the mobs still die faster. We're not competing against each other, we're fighting the monsters. (This of course for PvE servers.)<br />
<br />
Quote:  If poisons are hideously expensive, rare drops from greens, or non-stackable, there's no problem. But if, as I suspect, they will be easy to get, then they will be mandatory.<br />
<br />
If they're easy to get, then what's the problem? <br />
<br />
From what I'm reading, we have the potential here of having some very nice new tools added to our arsenal, and you're unhappy about them because you think that people will expect you to use them. I have to admit I'm not following the logic here. <br />
<br />
If it's a pain to do, nobody will expect you to do it. If it is easy to do, then it won't take much effort. So either way I'm not seeing the issue, beyond perhaps that you don't want to spend the time skilling up to be in a position to  use it.<br />
<br />
While it does take some time and/or effort and/or plat to skill up, I don't think that's a good reason to not want to see an improvement made. I'm not trying to be inflammatory when I say that it's almost saying &quot;I don't want this improvement to the class because I'm too lazy to take advantage of it but people will expect me to.&quot;  If you want to play the class to its fullest, you have to put in some effort, and if you don't want to put in the effort, then you accept the fact that you won't have all the abilities another rogue will.<br />
<br />
It's no different from AA skills - put in the time, get the abilities.<br />
<br />
But it seems a bit odd to me to say &quot;No hold the whole class back just because   I don't want to have to deal with this.&quot; <br />
<br />
It's entirely possible however I'm misinterpreting things of course, in which case I welcome clarification.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TibisHatter</div><div class="date">07-31-02, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These new effects are looking better and better every time I visit them, I must admit.<br />
<br />
The impact of Poisons v3, if it comes about, will depend on which of several different scenarios of accessibility to the ingredients and the costs involved per dose actually materialise.<br />
<br />
1. Easily accessed ingredients, low cost: Rogues would probably be expected to use poisons virtually all the time; at raids, in XP groups, anywhere. Rogues without good poisoning abilities may well end up at a disadvantage. If you could carry multiple doses of a finished poison in one slot (&quot;stackable&quot; for this discussion) then rogues will find it greatly advantageous to carry a range of effects with them. Soloing will become easier (or possible for some) and may even be economic.<br />
<br />
2. Easily accessed ingredients, high cost: Well-off rogues and rogues in upper-tier guilds who are willing to help fund the cost of making poisons will be at an advantage in this situation. Some education will be needed so people understand that if they want the rogue to use poison, they need a decent cut of the plat items, the same way that if you want symbols and aegolism from a cleric, they need plat to pay for peridots. The same soloing possibilities exist, but will be a lot less economic.<br />
<br />
3. Rare ingredients, low cost: The high playtime and well connected rogue will be advantaged here. With time and friends to farm the ingredients, they can get the poisons made more readily, even if they're not particularly well-off. With the Bazaar and some education, rogues might be able to pick up ingredients for sale, although the price that might be set may well kick poisons into category (4) for those without the time or support to farm the ingredients themselves. Poisons would be generally be reserved for larger fights; soloing with poisons would be rarer as the restricted availability of ingredients would cause problems with the number of finished poisons that would be available for this activity.<br />
<br />
4. Rare ingredients, high cost: Probably the scenario we dread the most. At this point, only those rogues with financial and ingredient farming support would expect to use poisons on a regular basis. Depending on whether the new poisons displace the old ones or not, raising Make Poison skill could become very difficult, and certainly out of the cost reach of the &quot;average&quot; rogue. Poisons would generally get reserved for very difficult encounters - if they are effective on them, that is. If the poisons are rare, expensive and ineffective on those encounters where it's worth using them, they will not be used at all. Soloing with poisons would be rare as the cost involved and the difficulties involved in getting the ingredients would make it unviable in most peoples eyes.<br />
<br />
There are probably other scenarios, but that's what I can think of for now.</div></div><hr />

I think that right there will be the main deciding factor. I’m with Tibis in that the more I think about these changes and look at these changes the more I like them, provided, they do not completely replace the old system. There is something to be said about knowing you will land that slow poison in your first hit (whether it is resisted is another matter).<br />
<br />
I for one would like to see VI simply add a new type of poison component. Lets call it a thickening agent. A different type of thickening agent for each tier, added to any recipe of that tier, makes the poison into this new “self buff” poison. This thickening agent could be brewed (like Heady Kiola only more difficult) or mixed with Make Poison or simply bought. This thickening agent then could be easy to come by at Tier I, but VERY hard at Tier IV and V … thereby combining a few of Tibis’ scenarios. A casual rogue could easily get a Tier I self buff, but only those with connections and resources could get a Tier V self buff.<br />
<br />
Leaving the old recipes intact, this would allow us many more choices. Do I want a lower dmg proc poison or a higher dmg first strike?<br />
<br />
It’s all speculation, but it does get my juices flowing</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly most of these effects are strongly analagous to the existing lines of effects our poisons have.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if you look at the spell effects which add the proc buff to you, they have titles such as &quot;Strike III Poison&quot; with descriptive text such as &quot;Soandso's blade glistens with poison&quot; and &quot;The poison dries up&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, those same spell effects recently had their class / level requirements changed to &quot;None&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fourthly, we are aware that the chap at Verant who is responsible for all things of a tradeskill nature, Dan Enright I believe, has said that he really does want to overhaul poison.  There was a vague hint that we might even see it before PoP.<br />

<br />
You have to stop thinking about the physics of poison, and think about the game engine. You are using an item to put a proc on yourself. That proc can go off, if memory serves, on ANY attack, and that includes ranged weapons. It's on YOU, not the weapon.<br />
<br />
Of course there is the possiblity that a) I am misremembering, or b) that they'll code something specific. But this key thing about this revamp/scenario is that it could require no changes to the game engine code, so the idea of adding code to implement seems counterproductive, though not impossible.<br />
<br />
Indeed if there aren't a few minor code changes, some odd things can happen. <br />

You apply poison once, and then stab a critter and throw a dagger at another one. Which weapon was that poison exactly?<br />
<br />
I hate to think that these are going to be added simply to allow for thrown weapons, or arrows for Rangers. Grr...if rangers get poisoned arrows and we don't get anything ... grrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_KayleighDrake</div><div class="date">08-01-02, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Restyn you just leaped ahead about fifty conclusions from where I'm sitting.<br />
<br />
1. I think we're all pretty sure this has nothing to do with rangers. All the buff spells got set to class &quot;none&quot; on the 26th.<br />
<br />
2. Assuming I'm remembering right, their proc spells would already do this so it'd be nothing new for them anyway.<br />
<br />
3. Why would you think these were being added just to allow for thrown weapons?<br />
<br />
It's an artifact of the game engine that a proc derived from a spell - a character-proc if you will, ends up going off on any attack the character does, be it melee, piercing, slashing, archery, throwing, etc. It may not make sense from a roleplaying angle but neither does respawning at your bind point. The fact is that if you want to change poison, you can either do something working within the existing engine (which is easier, hence faster and cheaper and doesn't require programmers) or you can change the engine (which is none of those things).<br />
<br />
4. If rangers got these, it would proc on regular weapons as well as their archery, so it's not just &quot;poisoned arrows&quot;.<br />
<br />
At this point, I'm completely convinced this has nothing to do with rangers, and I'm fairly convinced that this is our poison revamp. What remains to be seen is how hard they are to make.<br />

1)  He confirmed that on Test server right at this very moment there are new poisons which act as &quot;buffs&quot; with a duration and they will stay with you through zoning.<br />

<br />
If you have to rely on a proc for your effect, it makes Dex important for a rogue to have.  And dex should be important for rogues for roleplay reasons.<br />
<br />
And, if I was expected to have one &quot;instant proc&quot; poison, to make sure that the mob was slowed then I could use my &quot;proc buff&quot; poison, guess what.  Poison STILL goes UNUSED.  Because no one can carry a single charge of a poison for EVERY mob they have to kill.  Thats the problem we have RIGHT NOW.  The only people who will continue to use the old poisons are the masochists that use them now.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the lazy coding problems that are inherent with all the old poisons.  Lack of stackability or chargability being chief among them.<br />
<br />
On an aside, the main difference between say, poison making, and alchemy, is that, while expensive, all alchemy ingrediants can be purchased from vendors.  I'd much rather I had to buy ingredients from poison vendors than spend hours farming green mobs, even if the ingredients were expensive.

lets say we have to spend 3 hours farming/traveling through skyfire, lavastorm and karana to collect components for 5 poison combines... of those combines lets say we fail 2.. we now have 3 poisons lets say we fail apply on one of the 3, now we have 2 poisons, from 3 hours effort.. that last 15 minutes each.. rewarding, i am happy<br />

<br />
The ones that use poison today are not non-existent... also, if you have both one-shot poisons and self-proc poisons, they might use some of the same ingredients (like poison vials). That way, the self-proc poisons might help learn some people who do not use poison today to keep a hold of poison ingredients which they come upon by accident in normal fighting, to use them in one-shot poisons since they are already carrying mortar and other ingredients anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would you rather spend tons of plat making poisons, or saving quite a bit by farming? And buy the way, the bazaar wil really help out buying stuff for all kinds of tradeskills, and not just poison.<br />
<br />
Think about it like this: If no one on your server is farming poison ingredients now, they will be if there's a market for them. If rogues buy the stuff, lower level players will sell the stuff in the bazaar. The higher demand, the more players will sell the stuff, until you get some decent competition, which will bring the prices down. All in all, you could possibly end up making one trip to the bazaar to get the items you need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever gotten a new discipline and said hmmm the older discipline is actually better I think I'll stick with that one?<br />
<br />
CR in many high end scenarios comes down to coffins cause Verant likes to slip in the one mob in the path to your destination that see's through sneak. <br />
<br />
Throwing HA who has ever decided to throw instead of melee? Sure you can poison a few throwing items but those are almost as annoying to farm as the poisons themselves. For a month or two they had every throw from a rogue a crit or deadly which makes sense if I've been doing it for 55 dang levels and I'm suppose to be the best class at it and even with the crits and deadlies they were chump feed compared to the pigstickers. Now I'm back to 5dps or 100+melee.<br />
<br />
Is there another class where key items to their success are not stackable? Sure you say carry a stack of ingredients which is fine in many cases, but what about blind where you need the burned out lightstones? If you're already wasting the day farming why not be able to finish it off and get a true assessment of how many poisons you have. Besides I like the extra room for carrying my booze. They've already got me limited down to 200 drinks an escapade.<br />
<br />
20 minutes farming; 10 plat supplies; successfully created<br />
Your target has resisted your futile Tier IV poison. These poisons were mainly meant for PvP scenarios and not intended for mobs. Feel free to continue wasting ingredients and time on this mob no matter how many times you stick him each will get resisted. This has been a message from VI thankyou. (AHH Little thought here wouldn't the more poison you stick in the mob kinda add the chances of the poison taking effect? Somehow the previous doses of poison just seeped right back out of the body.)<br />
<br />
I have seen someone that destroyed the ragebringer and is using weapons from Luclin with a CoF because the dps was greater. What other class would even consider destroying their epic? We're supposedly the damage class but our epic holds us back from reaching the highest dps?<br />
<br />
Now there's talk of making the poison a proc'n buff ... are you foolish enough to think you're going to get more out of the poison that you would with a one time shot? You think they're going to make Mind Melt able to be used for 100DDam and stun 15 times during a horrendous 10 minute battle? That triples the output on damage for the poison and makes an extra 14 stuns. I get the feeling this will only spam the hell out of us with resist messages instead.<br />
<br />
I'd rather have the ability to forage a poison than for you to try to nerf it down to be able to fit into a 15 min proc slot. Or have the guards in Firona Vie not be able to see through the walls so one can successfully sneak in and buy supplies rather than sit at the zoneline and act as a common beggar. Even if we just have the poison stick for the duration it's suppose to on a mob as it does in PVP would be a great improvement. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I would love to see Verant start to take some considerations to the rogues to make them a little more special. I'm just saying I find it hard to believe that any type of change will actually be a good change in the long run if it comes from the hands of Verant. We've been a very comical whippin boy for them though, just like the oxymoron of a warrior holding agro. Take a look at our class abilities /sigh<br />
Verant is like a level one ranger when it comes to figuring out how to grant a rogue's wishes. Always shooting at the wrong target and missing whatever they're shooting at in the process.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do love my rogue though and wouldn't trade him for any other class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also while checking stacking here is some interesting stuff:<br />
<br />
The resist debuff appears to stack with all existing debuffs (cool and useful)<br />
<br />
The dots dont appear to stack with anything on the necro line of fire dots (funeral pyre, pyrocure etc..)<br />
<br />
The mana sieve dots appear to stack with everything.<br />
<br />
The Str/Dex debuff and Debuff + Hate reduce poisons dont appear to stack with cripple, however you should still get hate reduction, wouldnt matter however if cripple is available, you can simply use the single hate reducer poison proc.<br />
<br />
All in all, i am impressed, lets see if this goes live and how it works out. Edited by: Kenuvan at: 9/5/02 2:28:55 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunatly, I look at the names of some of the poisons, and I suspect these will be very HIGH level poisons.  Meaning I'm still stuck with the old ones.  The shissar ones will probably take shizzar venom sacks.<br />
<br />
That means the only poisons WORTH doing are gonna be the ones you couldn't farm if you want to.  Gonna have to ask the people on your next emp raid to hold onto sacs for you.<br />

<br />
As the situation is today I am very low on inventory space (renewed need for resist kit). So I'd like for us to get a magical tome in which we can 'scribe' components once for each. Then the properties of the book will free us from endless farming and wasting inventory space, by allowing us to drag an icon to a component mixer bar.<br />
<br />
Most of the code can be reused from spellcasters and remember, all spell casters are mostly free from having to lug obscene amounts of components around to be able to cast. I'd like for that to happen for us as well.<br />

<br />
1. §%§&amp;amp;§$&amp;amp;%$ Verant! Finally they changed the poison system and what they do: they nerfed the Zek servers....<br />
(first hit check poison was fine / Proc will be worthless in PvP)<br />
<br />
2. When we get poison buff procs someone will say me what with weapon procs then happens in that time ?<br />
(Would be sad if a proc like Tendonslice, Kalshazars Deceit or even a Bloodpoint wont proc in the poison buff proc or ?)<br />
<br />
3. As a suggestion I would say lets have a fleeting pouch where you can stack 4 Poisons that never! will be used up its poisons. Only put weapon on one poison in that pouch and you get a buff.<br />
<br />
The Poisoner´s Pouch could be a form like a quest or more typical: Like a AA exp point. (Thinking of Rangers Fleeting Quiver)<br />
<br />
<br />
Moreover one thing to mention: If throwing effects the poison buff and we are (like me) getting the dusty soriz worker pouch with summon the Uber throwing Shissar Fangs (with the insane delay) I would finally as good in Kiting as some other ppl are...<br />
(which suits me as I still depend my bandage skill for healing myself)<br />

they could even leave the farming situation as is with such a pouch. such a pouch would not appear to violate the unstackable poison problem that VI insists is real. Such a pouch would make the poison mastery skill quite attractive instead of dubious...

I know if I have focus and imp form and am using 2 blood points it often seems like I am doing more damage with procs.  One time I got siphon, siphon, nuke, siphon, nuke, siphon all in a row.  Imagine having a 100 DD proc to go with all of that.  I can easily imagine a flurry of procs dealing 800 damage or more.<br />
