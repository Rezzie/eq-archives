Guild Name: Sacred Haven<br />

Guild Leader: Sarcoth<br />
A short bit about your guild: Membership focuses on mature, casual gamers that plan to work together as a family. Raiding is the end goal. Member contribution to the guild is required only when online. Playing massive amounts of time is not a requirement, you play when you can. The leadership of the guild has a lot of experience leading raids from EQ1 and EQ2. This is not a guild for elitist or hardcore raiders.<br />
Guild category: Casual, Family-Oriented, Raiding Guild<br />
Recruiting members status: Accepting New Members<br />
<br />
Sacred Haven is one of the older online guilds on the internet today and has played in various MMORG's going back as far as June of 1996 (Meridan 59, The Realm, Ultima Online, EverQuest, and EverQuest 2). This is a family guild. Our membership is aimed at the mature, casual gamers that plan to work together with other members of the guild. The goal of the guild is to have fun and to become a casual raiding guild. All members at the upper levels will be expected to contribute by attending occasional raids. Sacred Haven may not be the first to accomplish something, but we'll never stop trying. Membership is perfect for those in the Eastern and Central time zones but others will not be turned away. Whether you can only play 4 hours or 40 hours a week, you are welcomed to help make Sacred Haven one of the best guilds in Vanguard.<br />
<br />
Elitist gamers and hardcore raiders are encouraged to find another guild to better suit their interests. All members are expected to spend time with other guild members and to occasionally give some of their time to help others. All members are required to be polite to members and non-members alike.<br />
<br />
Once raiding becomes possible, two days a week will be set up for it. We'll add additional days as long as there is a desire for more raiding. There will be no requirement for you to be online to raid, but everyone online will be expected to attend. Doing something else in game rather than attending a guild event will reflect on you negatively. Raids will be canceled around family holidays (Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas) and some other fun holidays (July 4th and New Years). We'll also postpone all raids for the first week after any expansion.<br />

Thank you,<br />
