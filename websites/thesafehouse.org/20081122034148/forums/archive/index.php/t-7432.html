<br />
Where do DOs drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">injijo</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive gotten SOs(2 now) randomly in regular missions, perhaps from bosses I didnt check that often.  Im still only level 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You got SINGLE origin Enhancements from bosses at level 12???<br />
<br />
You can't even use those for many levels?<br />
<br />
I am level 15 now, and so far I have never gotten anything but generic training enhancements...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's got to mean DOs, which you can get as mission rewards at that level.  They start to drop off normal mobs at level 20.<br />
<br />
You can buy level 15 and 20 DOs at shops in Steel Canyon and Skyway, and higher level enhancements, DO and SO both, in higher level zones.  Warcry has a list of the stores.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know I can buy them.. I was wondering about drops.<br />
<br />
As I said, I am level 15 and I have yet to see a single non-generic enhancement drop...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey!  You've got to give me at least five minutes after I post to realize what the question actually was!<br />
<br />
As I editted in, they start dropping at 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah okay, thanks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye Do's have a random chance of dropping off mobs that are 20th an above. At 24 ish the bosses drop one everytime im fairly sure. So's start dropping in the late late 20's to 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inaaki</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a lot of dropping in Talos Island right at the skyway zone in from the various Tsoo there.<br />
Had quite a lot drop in missions now too, since i dinged 20.<br />
<br />
I got some as reward for missions before, earliest was at lvl 15 i think.<br />
<br />
We did the Dr Vahzilok mission with three and he dropped a SO damage enhancement. Had a lvl 18 and 17 and the sidekicked lvl 11 got it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slyy Daugg</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dr. Vaz drops an SO enhancement every time you kill him.  <br />
<br />
...think about it   :stalk <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep, someone needs to find a mission and we can farm him:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-22-04, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 16 and have seen 2 DOs drop now, pretty sure they were both off of named mission bosses(the named one that was the head of the mission, not a generic boss).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">05-22-04, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gotten DOs twice, both as quest rewards iirc.  They were both tech, so I couldn't use them :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-23-04, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DO's start dropping randomly at 17-18, at 19-20 I get about 1 DO for every 3-5 Training Enhancements I get.<br />
<br />
About Dr. Vaz: He does NOT drop a SO everytime - trust me, I know what I'm talking about, I've got about 15 Vaz Kills from different missions I have and friends have.<br />
<br />
Also, you won't get exp/inf/items from Vaz once you are ~5 levels higher than him, so the SOs you get might be 22-23 at most depending on when you got the mission.<br />
<br />
It's not worth the trouble - I'd rather buy my SOs later :)</div></div><hr />
