Naruto Attacks on Xbox 360<br />
Ubisoft brings the ninja-in-training exclusively to Microsoft's new console.<br />
by Kathleen Sanders<br />
<br />
<br />
April 6, 2006 - Today Ubisoft announced it is developing a game based on the popular Naruto animated series. The title is being created exclusively for the Xbox 360 under an agreement with Viz Media.<br />
<br />
Naruto, which features the lesson-packed adventures of a Nine-Tailed Fox demon who is also a ninja-in-training, has gained a frightening level of popularity in Japan. Since its debut in 2002 the Naruto anime series has spawned several videogames and two movies in its home country. Recently, Naruto invaded U.S. soil via the Cartoon Network.<br />
<br />
Ubisoft's new game will, of course, expand the presence of the wily ninja-to-be, though for now the company is staying quiet on further details.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naruto is a huge hit around the world, and we are thrilled to have the opportunity to develop a game that will bring this exciting character to life,&quot; said Ubisoft's Christian Salomon. &quot;Naruto is part of a wave of Japanese manga and anime that appeals to kids and adolescents alike, and we plan to deliver to them every bit of the excitement they have experienced in Naruto's manga, movies and TV shows.&quot;<br />
<br />
The game is slated for release in 2007.<br />
<br />
Hmm interesting heh.</div></div><hr />

The controls were a bit simplistic and the story mode left something to be desired, but multiplayer is still definitely a hoot. There's nothing like seeing my little brother's reaction as I beat him with Shikamaru for the 8th time in a row :)</div></div><hr />
