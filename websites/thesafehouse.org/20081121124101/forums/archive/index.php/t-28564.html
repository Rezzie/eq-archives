<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maliphus_Iscariot</div><div class="date">02-25-07, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I've been PvP-ing a lot lately since the patch and I wanted to give you all my results from the last 6 pvp fights I had. Some were good fights w/ cool people and some were w/ straight up buttholes. I wish most people on Varking were of the cool variety. They fight somewhat fair(no corpse camping) and then chat about it. I like knowing how the other side thinks we Rogues fair in PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fight 1:  22 Rogue vs. 20 Shaman<br />
<br />
Somehow I managed to get the drop on this shaman. I actually managed to get a crit ravage + shank off on these annoying little bastards. Afterwards he tries to book it to gain his bearings and figure out what is going on. I responded w/ Knee Break and poor shaman is no longer running fast. Shaman attempts to heal himself while walking backwards. I responded w/ a well timed Flash Powder and stunned the Shaman's casting. I ran behind the Shaman and backstabbed again and re-does Knee Break. Shaman starts to run just to get away and I took down the Shaman w/ a flurry of Throwing daggers + a lucky flash that stunned another healing spell. 2 silver gained.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fight 2:  22 Rogue vs. 21 Blood Mage<br />
<br />
Blood Mage got the drop on me. I was checking the market and he hit me for 450 off the bat. Hurt like hell. I quickly escaped from the market and targeted the Blood Mage. I hit him w/ Throwing Daggers until I'm close enough to Knee Break him. A proceeded to hit him w/ a combination of Wicked Strikes, Flash Powders, and Backstabs.  Blood Mage rooted me and managed to get away w/ 102 HP left. This was a good fight. We sat and chatted for about 10 mins after the fight. He told me that he did not expect a Rogue to do as well as I did against him.  Nothing gained. =(<br />
<br />
<br />
Fight 3: 22 Rogue vs. 21 Shaman<br />
<br />
This fight was a farce to begin with. I thought it was a one on one match and I was doing quite well until his lvl 32 Druid buddy rolled in and proceeded to root, dot, and generally be an ass while letting the 21 Shaman beat the tar out of me.  Shaman and buddy wins but later gets rolled by a party of 30's that decided to see what happened. Talking w/ some people in the area that these 2 assclowns do this all the time to people my level. The lvl 21 will find someone and call his buddy over to do most of the damage and let the lvl 21 get the kill for the coin and the infamy.  I lost 1 silver. =(<br />
<br />
Fight 4: 22 Rogue vs 24 Dread Knight<br />
<br />
I was dead from the start. Holy crap can they hit. I tried my best but alas it wasn't enough. I managed to get him to 50% before I took a dirt nap. Nice guy and chatted for a bit while I munched on some soil. I lost 5 copper. =/<br />
<br />
<br />
Fight 5:  23 Rogue vs 20 Ranger<br />
<br />
This guy was just a pompous prick. I was in Khal bank looking up some new gear and he gets the drop on me. Hits me for 600 off the bat. I run outside to get my bearings and the fight begins. I wound up pwning this into the ground and he starts talking smack in /shout about how he was beaten only because I was 3 lvls above him. So, I wait for him to get his gear and I get the drop on him this time. I was waiting ontop of a building and saw him hanging out underneath.. I jumped down behind him and landed a Crit ravage and immediately roll into Shank. Ranger starts running (with his back towards me) and I figured I'd follow up that Shank w/ it's trusty partner Shiv. To make a long story short: Dead ranger who started a fight he couldn't win and started talking smack because he lost. Gained 20 copper each kill. &gt;=)<br />
<br />
<br />
Fight 6:  23 Rogue vs 25 Sorc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me start off this fight by saying not being able to target pets is something that needs to be fixed in PvP asap. I don't know how many of you know but if a caster has a pet (Necros excluded I think) after you and they die the pet will still attack you until you die, logout, etc... Well, Sorc gets the jump on me and hits me hard first. This is where I'm glad I picked Raki. I activate my Racial Ability (Planar Shift) and head out after the Sorc. Throwing Daggers until I can get close enough to use Flash Powder and then Knee Break. After that I continue w/ the Wicked Strike, Flash Powder + Backstab routine until he dies. If I wasn't a Raki this fight would have turned out a lot differently. Nice guy. I told him later about the Raki racial ability and how it negates 50% magic damage. I gained 14 silver. &gt;=)<br />
<br />
<br />
Final thoughts:<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if these cases were because of poor pvpers but all the people I chatted w/ afterwards definitely looked at Rogues in a different way. We are not the &quot;soft&quot; targets anymore. After the patch I have managed to bring my infamy from a measly 84 back up to a 287. If we keep getting better and better things from the patches I forsee good things for our class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rogues do it better from behind.&quot;  &lt;-- qft~!</div></div><hr />

But so far I've had my ass handed to me by groups ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hexcaliber</div><div class="date">03-14-07, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick heads up about necro's as I play both rogue and necro, necro pets can be targeted and disappear the instant the Nec is killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omani</div><div class="date">03-15-07, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh.... I don't know what things were like post patch to be honest because I avoided PvP until I got better gear and weapons.<br />
<br />
All I can say right now is that for some reason I am having a hard time in both PvP and PvE.  My poison doesn't seem at all effective and I'm starting to get frustrated because I often miss on very important hits.  <br />
<br />
I find that in PvE, a mob of equal level to me will bring my hitpoints way down before I can kill it and a mob one level higher will often own me because I keep missing and all my skills are maxed at each level.<br />
<br />
In PvP, the only way I can win a fight is to gank and even that's not always the case because my damage doesn't appear to be enough to take them out before they kill me, or I'm able to blind them long enough to go into wood elf racial form and run away.<br />
<br />
Am I just totally horrible in both PvP and PvE?  I'm starting to get frustrated because I don't play during hours that lots of people are on and grouping is often not an option.  Solo PvP, I have to be lucky at, and in solo PvE, only mobs I can kill with ease are 2 levels lower than me.  Sigh......:frown</div></div><hr />
