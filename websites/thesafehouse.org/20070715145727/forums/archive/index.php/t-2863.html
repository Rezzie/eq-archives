<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kezzek</div><div class="date">08-15-00, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are three keyed dungeons in Kunark that require quests to obtain entrance to (that I know about).  Some of these quests are confusing, so I figured I would summarize them here for everyone.  Hopefully as we go to these zones we can keep an eye out for these things in parallel with whatever else we may be doing.  Please feel free to add any other info that you have personally discovered.<br />
<br />
The Idol of Trakanon (Key to Sebilis)Obtain the medallions of the Kunzar and Nathsar which drop from the Froglok Hunter and Forager in Trakanon's Teeth.  Turn these 2 medallions in to Emperor Ganak in Trakanon's Teeth to receive the Idol of Trakanon.<br />
<br />
The Key to Charisis (Key to Howling Stones)Obtain the Jade Chokidai Prod which drops from the Chancellor of Di'Zok in the heart of the Sarnak Fortress in the Lake of Ill omen.  Obtain the Xalgozian Fang from Xalgoz deep in the dungeon of Kaesora.  Turn these 2 items in to a froglok named Durgaz in the Swamp of no Hope to receive the key to charisis.  I have heard that some people have been boned on this quest, so it may be worthwhile to charm Durgaz before turning in the items.<br />
<br />
The Rune of Scale (Key to Veeshan's Peak)Many of the components for this quest appear to be redundant on the surface, you will need to identify the medallion pieces to make sure it's the correct one.  However, based on what I've read, you turn the following 4 items in to Emperor Ganak in Trakanon's Teeth to obtain the Rune of Scale:<br />
<br />
1. Trakanon's toothThis is obtained from killing the dragon Trakanon deep in Sebilis.<br />
2. Medallion of the JarsathTurn in the 3 portions of this medallion to Xiblin Fizzlebik on chessboard island in the Timorous Deep:<br />
<br />
a. Upper portion - Found on the ground at p52, p2935 in the Swamp of no Hope<br />
b. Middle portion - Dropped by &quot;an ancient Jarsath&quot; a wandering iksar skeleton in Firiona Vie<br />
c. Bottom portion - Dropped by the Bloodgill Marauder who guards the entrance to Veskar (unimplemented underwater dungeon) at the bottom of the Lake of Ill Omen <br />
3. Medallion of the ObulusTurn in the 3 portions of this medallion to Slixin Klex, a level 50 skeleton in the Burning Woods (n680 n1120).<br />
<br />
a. Upper portion - Dropped by Sselot Dnaas who spawns in the island in Warslik's Woods.  You can also give him a burnished wooden staff from Chardok to obtain this portion.<br />
b. Middle portion - Dropped by a rotting skeleton at p2100 n5100 in the dreadlands<br />
c. Bottom portion - Dropped by the Pained Soul in Sebilis<br />
4. Medallion of the KylongTurn in the 3 portions of this medallion to Proffesor Akabao in the Lake of Ill Omen.<br />
<br />
a. Upper portion - Obtained through a Chardok quest.  You must take a Black Sapphire and a Ruby to Niblek.  He is a small ratman located deep in the slave area of Chardok.  It may be possible to obtain the portion by killing him also.<br />
b. Middle portion - Possibly dropped by a Bloodgill Marauder (although I don't think so) and/or Verix Kyloxs in Karnor's Castle.<br />
c. Bottom portion - Dropped in the Library in Kaesora.<br />
<br />

Froglok Hunter - Medallion of the Kunzar for Sebilis key<br />
Froglok Forager - Medallion of the Nathsar for Sebilis key<br />
Warslik's WoodsSselot Dnaas - located on the island (?), give him a burnished wooden stave from Chardok or kill him to obtain Upper Obulus<br />
<br />
<br />
The key just to get into Veeshan's Peak is obviously a massive undertaking, never mind the insane difficulty of the zone.  For every PC who is to enter, Trakanon must die.  Since Trakanon hasn't even been killed once on our server to my knowledge, this means that we are in for quite a wait just to even have a chance to get into VP.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, once you are in VP, I have heard that it is very very difficult to get out.  In general, the quest items for the key fall into three categories - tasks, camps, and massive undertakings.  Tasks can be done whenever, so no big deal.  The massive undertakings are just that…so we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.  Camps are something that we can potentially knock out while doing something else.  For example, getting bottom kylong and burnished wooden staves is something we could do while we just happen to be in those dungeons for alternate reasons.<br />
<br />
Hope this is helpful and gives everyone some scope on the road ahead.<br />
