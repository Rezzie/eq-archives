Quote: EQPvP 101 The Basics – Attitude<br />
For those just starting on a Zek Server<br />
<br />
Lesson 1: I came here to kill people<br />
Repeat after me, “I came here to kill people”<br />
Welcome to EverQuest with “option” for PvP, but your grave and the coffin of every player on the PvP servers was nailed shut when you logged into these servers. If you are not here to kill or be killed, take your friendly ass to Bluebie Ro or Friendly Marr.<br />
This is Player vs Player, plan on dying, plan on having to defend yourself, plan on having every goal you have set for yourself in the game outside of PvP delayed. Plan on being stabbed by those you consider friends, plan on getting upset, plan on accomplishing nothing for days on end.<br />
You did not come here to kill dragons, you did not come here to kill gods, you did not come here to have the phatest lewt in the game, you came here to kill people. The sooner you get it through your bluebie head that you are a killer, and REALIZE that this is what you wanted to be, the faster you will start gaining the mentality that will keep you alive and the less you will see “LOADING PLEASE WAIT….”<br />
If the dragons fall and the gods are defeated, those are added bonuses, but you did not come to this server to do that, you are a killer or you are a victim, your choice.<br />
<br />
Lesson 2: You just got knocked the @#%$ out, what now?<br />
Aweee, did Mister Meanie Inkie come gank you and take your spawn? Would you like a tissue? Oh you think that if you spam him for the next hour calling him every hostile word in your petty little head that you are going to upset him? Bluebie Please.<br />
Why did he kill you? Why did he have to come into your dungeon on your only day off this month and gank you just before the spawn with the killer robe you wanted was about to drop?<br />
Your answer is simple, yet so hard for many to understand, “Because he can”<br />
He came to this server to kill people, if you still haven’t grasped lesson 1, please review it now. If you are reading this for the third time, and still haven’t grasped lesson 1, please delete your sorry ass and get the hell off of the “Zek” servers.<br />
Now you are sitting naked at your bind point looking stupid, the newbies are looking at you wondering what just kicked your ass. What are you going to do?<br />
You are going to run to your corpse, you are going to keep your mouth shut, you are going to loot your corpse, and you are going to leave. Why are you going to do this?<br />
Because Mister Meanie Inkie kicked your ass, and Mister Meanie Inkie is standing on your corpse that has everything you own on it. Because Mister Meanie Inkie was smart enough to attack you when you were not ready, he has earned the right to stay there at HIS spawn that your ass has forfeited to him by combat at arms. Don’t like this concept?<br />
Too bad, welcome to Zek. Get your @#%$, get out, stay out for a while. Show some respect to the player who just ganked you. There is gonna be a time when he is on the ground bleeding to death because of your actions, and he will be humbled back.<br />
What now? There are more zones and spawns in this game then you can ever see, time to find something else to do. <br />
Give you a clue, how about going to the enemies home city and learning how to fight.<br />
<br />
Lesson 3: You are at the bottom of the food chain<br />
Welcome to Zek, Mister Worm. You will eat dirt and like it. You should be happy we allow you to have OUR dirt, the only reason you do is because we have stopped caring about it, and players like you.<br />
You do not own this server, you do not have the right to hunt anywhere without our permission. <br />
You may ask, who is “Our”? “Our” is the first generation players of the Zek servers who run this place. Think of this as a jail cell, and we run the block. Get out of order and get a beating. Want to play hardball with us, then you best get strong, get some heavy levels, get a lot of friends, and get owned anyway. Such is life on the Zeks. <br />
You earn the right to eat better then dirt or the right to breathe by doing one of two things.<br />
First, is you ask our permission, and if we are in a humorous mood, we may allow you. <br />
Second is to do it with attitude and balls, and when we ask you why you are on our turf, your response should be “Do something about it”, for more about “Do something about it” see lesson 6.<br />
Again, You EARN the right to breathe, and eat something else besides dirt. You EARN this right by being tougher then the people who are telling you that you don’t have this right. You EARN your respect, and your reputation. You EARN the right to stop being a worm, and start being a rat.<br />
If you want to be a rat without earning the right to be one, you will be ganked over and over again. If you forgot what to do when we gank you, please review lesson 2 a second time.<br />
When you actually move up from Worm to Rat, you own the worms. Just be careful, because some worms have cats as friends who like to eat Rats who get too big for their ability to produce death.<br />
<br />
Lesson 4: Just kill him<br />
Ok, some munchie elfie just ganked your gnoll scout that you thought you owned, that gnoll also had a rusty two handed sword that you really could of used. If you seriously thought that was your gnoll, please go back and review lesson 3. That was not your gnoll, that was OUR gnoll, how quickly you forget.<br />
So now you are upset, because this elfie interrupted your ability to level. First, I thought I told you that you were not allowed to breathe without asking for permission, but I guess you have started to get some balls and do it anyway, good! You are learning.<br />
So now this elfie just laughed at you and your inability to finish what you have started. Feel the blood flowing yet? Getting mad? Feel yourself hitting the keys while you are typing just a bit harder then before? Oh you are starting to feel the pull to this server.<br />
You are the little kid on the playground and some bully just took your ball. Now the elfie walks over to 2 other elfies who are also higher level then you, and nightmares of your childhood come to mind. The elfie gives that sword to his friend, and he shows it off to you, taunting you to do something about it.<br />
Four choices you have in front of you, and this is your moment of truth.<br />
First, you realize you are going to get your ass kicked, you turn around and look for another one of our gnolls to kill. If this was your decision, start the lesson over, because that same elf just did the same thing to you.<br />
Second, you get stupid and call the “Police” to come intervene. Lets say for kicks and giggles that a cop (Guide or GM) shows up, they are going to sit down and explain to you that this is a pvp server, and they can do that. This makes matters worse and now the elves are laughing hysterically at you. <br />
Third, you shout to the zone for help, and all of a sudden the entire zone is laughing at you. Please delete your character and go lie down next to your dog in the corner. When the dog goes to eat out of his bowl, kick him really hard and remind him that its your food. After doing this for an hour, start a new character and come back into the game. Also, go back to lesson one and start over EQPvP 101, you just failed.<br />
Fourth and correct answer, just kill him. Walk up to him and his friends, and kick all 3 of their asses. You do not talk smack, you do not try to come up with some witty line out of a Rambo movie, you simply walk up and attack the elf that took your kill. You do not stop until he is dead or you are dead. You do not beat him down to almost no life then taunt him, you kill him. If he runs to all the way from Blackburrow to Akanon, you follow his ass to Akanon and finish it.<br />
You do not run, you do not flee, you do not ask for help, you do not ask him what his mother was doing with the ogre last night, you just kill him or die trying.<br />
If you do actually kill him, the next person that goes down is the one with the rusty 2 handed sword. Why? Because he was the one who received it. You keep attacking him until he is dead or you are dead. Rules are a bit different now. If this one flees, chase him off the play ground, then go after the third.<br />
Why the third? Because he was there. Beat his ass into the ground and kill him too. If he flees the playground, the playground is yours and you made your point.<br />
Now that is best case scenario, now lets deal with worst case scenario. You attack them, and they OWN you. You get rooted, you get nuke bombed, and they embarrass you. At this point, please return to lesson two and follow instructions on what to do to get your corpse back.<br />
At minimal, you showed them that you are not one to be @#%$ with, and next time they will chose to pick on someone who they can bully and not have to spend the time in battle with.<br />
<br />
Lesson 5: School of Hard Knocks and RESPECT<br />
Oh, you are one of those players who like to tell everyone that you can hunt where you want to hunt because you pay your 10 bucks a month to be here? <br />
Heh, great, we love players like you. <br />
See, we pay our 10 bucks a month to do what we want to do, shove cold hard reality in your face and make you scream in agony. <br />
Oh please tell us you are the type who like to tell us they are going to call the “Police” too, we love that.<br />
I can play angel with the best of them, and when they show, my halo will be polished to a clean shine, and will GLOW for them. You will be so upset that you are using harsh language and screaming at the “police” person to do what you think his job is because you pay his salary. You own everything, and the Guide leaves laughing at you, because you forgot where you were. <br />
See we know that the “Police” are king, and we treat them with respect at all times. You are a piece of @#%$ who thinks they own everything, we win.<br />
Oh, now that the “police” are not going to help you still think you got a chance? Oh you someone big in real life and are now gonna sue me? <br />
Oh, you are my BEST friend, and we are gonna be best friends for a long time. <br />
I am going to follow you everywhere you go, I am going to kick your helm in, I am bloody my sword on you or burn you to a crisp. I hope you walk into water so I can root you and watch you drown. I get a kick of casting blindness on you and watching you run off a cliff. I am going to kill you so much that your hard drive is going to crash from so many LOADING PLEASE WAIT sessions.<br />
See on this server, you have one right, you have the right to get your body. I am going to ask you to get your body and leave MY zone. You say no and refuse to leave, I have the certified stamp of approval to put steel to bone on you a second time. If you leave the zone, and I catch you in another zone, you are free game.<br />
Here is what you forgot. You don’t run this server, its OUR server. Forgot who OUR is, review lesson one.<br />
Second, you forgot keep your mouth shut when you get your ass handed to you, as learned in lesson 2.<br />
Third, you forgot that you are a worm, and picked a fight with someone higher up on the food chain then you, please review lesson 3.<br />
Fourth, you didn’t kick your dog hard enough, review lesson 4.<br />
Fifth, you are here to learn the hard way, some people need that though, I guess that is you.<br />
Lets start with respect. First you need to learn the order of respect. <br />
Highest respect is to the “Police”, because you piss them off enough you will no longer have an account, and you end up buying a second account and starting on the bottom of the food chain again. They are the ultimate authority regardless if you are a dragon who can kill any other 10 players at one time. If one shows up, its “Yes m’lord” or “Yes m’lady” and whatever they state is law, is law. Hear what they have got to say, don’t argue, and leave.<br />
Second, is to you. Easiest way to respect yourself is to learn who you are and where you are allowed and not allowed to be.<br />
Third, is to the powers of the server. Learn who runs which area, and either make friends with them, or don’t cross them.<br />
Third is anyone who can take you out. Either they are stronger characters or play the game better, either way they can make your life hell if you piss them off enough.<br />
Fourth and final, is everyone below you on the food chain. Respect them because even the smallest worms can grow up to be the largest dragons. They will REMEMBER you if you made their life hell for reasons not out of respect, and repay it a hundred times over. Don’t mistake respect with being soft, treat them rough, but be respectful.<br />
No respect is given to those that show dishonor and lack of respect. Gank these morons mercilessly and earn more respect from those who have honor and show respect.<br />
<br />
Lesson 6: Do something about it<br />
Don’t take @#%$ from anyone on a zek server, play it tough, but play it right. Someone says @#%$ to you, hit them so hard that they see stars. If they do anything but stand there and bleed hit them again. If they open their mouth again hit them again. If they attack back, even a single punch, finish the fight and put them on the ground. If they didn’t attack you and backed off, cool down and leave them, you proved your point.<br />
Don’t talk smack, let your actions tell the story. Anyone can come on the server and talk big smack, it’s the walk and actions that will make your reputation.<br />
Doing something about it doesn’t mean bind point rushing and corpse camping someone. This will be covered more in EQPvP 102, dealing with Honor and Reputation. Doing something about it is about attitude.<br />
As long as you maintain honor, do what you want to do. If anyone has a problem with it, tell them they can do something about it. Someone doesn’t do something you like, do something about it. The worst thing you can do is to never do anything. Sitting there with your thumb up your ass is the best way to get ganked and earn the reputation of “a lamer”<br />
<br />
Lesson 7: Everyone takes a beating now and then<br />
So you were walking around talking big smack and a group of 4 trolls introduced you what pointy horns are really used for. You were picking on some inkie who you thought was a cleric, and it turned out he was a SK who Harmtouched you so hard that when you woke up, you had 3 different patches to update. So you were laughing at a ranger 8 levels below you when he stepped up and put you on the ground. Ok scratch the last one, it is too far fetched, but you get the idea.<br />
Realizing that you are mortal and can be killed is one of the most important aspects of PvP combat. You are not a @#%$, you can be killed. You will not win every fight you engage.<br />
The biggest thing to taking a beating is to LEARN from what happened. Why did you die? What mistakes did you make? How could you of won that fight? Where was your partner when you were getting turned into a Popsicle by the troll with the staff?<br />
Don’t think that everything in this game is luck, there is a lot of skills involved in PvP combat. Learning to make the same mistake ONCE and not again, will keep you on the up and up and killing more.<br />
Speaking of learning, your dog by now should know not to go to his food bowl while you are lying on the ground trying to figure out the name of your next character. If he can learn, so can you.<br />
<br />
Lesson 8: Watch your back<br />
Final lesson of EQPvP 101, is to always watch your back. If you are in a dungeon, your back is against the wall, and you are watching your screen in all directions to make sure no one is coming up on you.<br />
If you are in an outdoor zone, you are on a zone wall, if you have to be in the middle of the zone, you are in third person view watching all directions.<br />
Smart pvp’ers are constantly updating the /who list to know WHO is in the zone. Those who have been around for a long time know most of the enemies by name, approx level, definite class, and definite race. Also the reputation of the player as a good pk or a bad pk, honor level, and the guild they represent.<br />
This knowledge takes time, but its something to get used to as soon as you enter the zone.<br />

There's nothing dishonourable about being anti-pk there, and, unless you wanna be a grief-pk, you don't go there with the mentality set in the first paragraph. End of discussion, case closed. There is virtually no role-pk'ing on RZ. Sad to say, but true. No one kills people because they are a different race, or different religion, etc. it's because of that shiny BP or grieves they happen to be wearing.<br />
<br />
Anti-pk. Proud of it. Bring it on, see if that changes my quality of PvP though.<br />

born 20/03-1999 - created by stupid(that time), blond Norwegian, who read the manual =)turn in book go PVP.. and didnt even know EQ was online game and had no idea what PVP ment.<br />
<br />
some of you know the two first weeks of EQ was a pain, servers went up and down, i tried several servers =) but laag was horrible, well i had heard of laag &amp;amp; Ping from Diablo and OkBridge(online Bridge),but RZ had few people on it and Lag wasnt horrible, so i stayed here =(.<br />
<br />
OK, i just want you all to know i am not agressive, i am not on RZ to kill people, but i really like the people i have made friends with and never gave up life on RZ. But i also must say RZ (i dont know the other zek servers) has changed alot.<br />
<br />
Yes there should be a good warning when people want to create a char on the Zek's.<br />
<br />
Not sure if i make much sence but there happily more Nice people on RZ than there is bad people, but at lower levels , and in Freeport and GF, the game has tunred out very saddening =( atleast for them that try to get exp and level.<br />
<br />
Well my main Point, Servers changes,and we all got good and &quot;bad&quot; people on the servers , On the Zeks's we have the ability to Hunt/punish the &quot;bad&quot; people, or off cource be hunted by the &quot;bad&quot; people.<br />
<br />
And I also choose to play a Rogue as main, I wont give out how many hours i spent leveling on my Rogue but its very much, and getting ganked and loose your hard earned armour realy hurts =, but its still something we on the RZ have to live with.<br />
<br />
I  will have to agree with the post , but excuse me I didnt know about PVP when i started, so dont tell me go blue. <br />
<br />
There is also possible to be on RZ and not kill a single player.<br />

I only play PvP now when in the mood to kill someone.<br />
I played for a few days and because I was used to a blue server I got ganked constantly. But I took it in good spirit. Showed respect to &quot;my betters&quot; and carried on. But i didnt enjoy it the way I was playin .<br />
<br />
so I left.<br />
<br />
I go back when I'm in the right mood and I'm better at it now. I just prefer my blue server.<br />

At least post 20... pre 20 its a bunch of deleveled tanks running around killing people that can't really hope to fight back.  There is no PvP to speak of on rallos, I played there 52 lvls and was only attacked 10 times, 4 times I escaped, 4 times the attacker suffered exp loss from mobs(this was at lower lvls), 2 times Darkenbane members layed dead at my feet.  <br />
<br />
On TZ I was in easily over 500 pvp battles going from lvl 1 to 53.  I'd say thats a large difference.</div></div><hr />

Not so much weekdays tho - odd.<br />
<br />
Its good tho cos when ive gone back to my vorpse i allways give  a grats to my &quot;ganker&quot; and they are allways cool about it and wish me luck in gettin better.<br />
<br />
i did gank a shadowknight of the same level tho we kept goin at it even tho i kept winnig an he was cool about it too. <br />
<br />
I might start playin on tallon more but I really like my main on Luclin.</div></div><hr />

it says some crap about &quot;this class/race/religeous combo is considered medium difficulty&quot;<br />

this post should replace that page on the team servers, on rallos it should have one added paragraph.<br />
<br />
<br />
   When you spawn in A_NewbieZone_00 and get ganked before you even turn in the note for your tunic Dont Cry.  If you have been ganked for the nth time in west freeport Do not shout to the zone how you have nothing leave me alone I just want to lvl blah blah blah.  The Newbie Zones Are For the Newbie Killers. If you want to come to rallos and lvl GO TO ANOTHER ZONE!  freeport has 4 count em 4 newbie zones attached to it efp/wfp/ndr/and the south side of ec from fp all the way to wc. Only west freeport is the newbie nightmare. Get a clue Grow a Brain or Get The @#%$ OFF THE SERVER! It is PAINFULLY easy to get to 8th lvl without ever getting ganked on this server, So shut the hell up and find some place else to lvl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tular the Most Ill</div><div class="date">04-17-01, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was actually thinking about playing on a pvp server and even got a rogue to lvl 5 on one just to try it out. I was detered however, when i found the overwhelming majority of players i met where whiners that constantly shout &quot;so-and-so is a pk!!!1.&quot; From my experience, atleast at low levels pvp is just a bluebie server with pvp ability, all the whiners and &quot;police&quot; callers made up 90% of the population. I only met one person who actually liked pking and liked the thrill of the hunt (or being hunted).<br />
<br />
I am not afraid of these circumstances described in the &quot;rules&quot;, they seem very appealing from my viewpoint as a rogue that was constantly puched around by casters unless they were in an arena with me. I only wish that these circumstances were completely true on the zek servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maximilean</div><div class="date">04-20-01, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, I think it's all a little melodramatic.  My Vallon elf got along fine leveling on Antonica, little successful pking against me.  Just assume everyone who can kill you is going to, keep your ears and eyes open, and use hide, invis, and gate judiciously, depending on class.  And of course, keep your best lineup of PVP spells memmed.  Sent a Shank shammy running back to Chloroplast mommy a week or two ago... In the middle of Freeport.<br />
<br />
Total Shank/Combine kills vs. me = 1, and then when I was OOM in the bank not fighting back, since he was immo and my banking was finished  <br />
<br />
The PVP rules need to decide that this is really a 4 team game and forbid cross-team grouping, buffing, healing, etc.  The new &quot;RP server&quot; (BLUE!) that is going to have grouping restrictions is a step in the WRONG direction if they don't reform TZ and VZ's systems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">04-21-01, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe Max, what is your elf's name?<br />
<br />
Saying ye sent someone back to &quot;mommy&quot; is...interesting. I never keep track of those that &quot;got away&quot; nor do I ever offer excuses if someone slays me.  As I once said to a halfling I slew in Paw, &quot;we are at war, the ever vigilant live, the lax die&quot;.<br />
<br />
Killing people has never been an issue of &quot;record&quot; for me and most of the Shanks.  I attack people mainly for roleplay purposes or to launch an attack on a zone I wish to gain items from (such as Cazic Thule etc).<br />
<br />
There is a new Zek server coming up where they plan to test some new rules.  I did my best at the panel discussion to support the idea of hardcoding one of the team servers to team, setting one as &quot;good vs evil&quot; and letting a move log occur.  It seemed that this was also the idea of Lady D who was leading the discussion so we know we have at least one supporter.  I also mentioned to several of the dev team that rules needed to be made clear and I suggested a bit of explanation be added to the log in screen so folks who may have just chosen a PvP server due to low population will have more warning of what they are getting into.<br />

As for my snide remarks, I couldn't say I've killed a Shank because I haven't yet.  That's how notorious a guild it is, yes?    <br />
<br />
One interesting thing about joining Zek to kill.... I did join it for PVP, obviously, but I don't feel I have to KOS anyone but my enemies list; heck, that covers it anyway.  As a good Elf, I think it's sensible to roleplay a peaceloving char; targets go out of their way to present themselves by attacking me or others.<br />
<br />
Not that I 'disapprove' of PKing or anything ridiculous like that.  I just roleplay a do-gooder, as I always tend to, and that involves more anti-pk fighting than anything.  I'm sure glad I get attacked, and it's not like I'm playing PvE on a PvP server.  The Shanks, the Combines, the Shorty PK guilds, Illuvatae... They are all great folks that serve a good purpose.  <br />
<br />
I guess I might attack a non-elf PK guilder in an unprovoked fashion... Just to keep things fair.</div></div><hr />

Quote:  Re: Hmmm<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 lol I laughed. I have found most PKers to be the indignant ones when you kill them. They are also the ones that sport most of the no drop armour because, generally, their cowardice runs very deep. They love to use every cowardly tactic possible to jump you. This one schmuck corpse camped a friend of mine on the wisp isle in Erud's Crossing for 2 hours. He was displeased when I logged on and assisted him in feeling the joy of such matters. He actually logged off after 30 min, played an alt, and came back...only to die again. I decided to start roleplaying I had changed careers and became a mortician because so many of the coward's bodies littered the ground. We played this game for about 4 or 5 hours. I especially enjoyed near the end where he begged me to let him loot. I said &quot;ok&quot; a couple times and killed him anyhow. <br />
<br />
I suppose, now I think of it a bit more, there is a fair range in PKers, just like anti-PKs and neutrals. It just strikes me odd that the people that have gotten most upset, in my experience, have been PKs<br />

As to BoTB being a test of PvP skill, it isnt.  If it were meant to test PvP skill, they would re-equip all the entrants (each person getting the same gear as others of their class) before turning em loose on eachother.<br />
<br />
BoTB is a measure of whose combination of gear and PvP skill is best.  Gear quality is a measure of who is better at farming, and also at high end PvE raiding.  The red server rules make both of these activities more difficult, i think, so red servers arent as good at them, and hence, dont have as good of gear.<br />

Imagine now, if BoTB wasnt even PvP.  They haul in the 3 teams and see who is best at PvE.  Tests would include &quot;kill one big mob with minimum casualties&quot;, &quot;kill a continuous stream of smaller mobs with either minimum casualties OR kill as many as you can before you go down&quot;, and, of course, &quot;sit on your ass for as many hours as possible without going crazy&quot; (the epic simulation)... though this would require on site monitoring of the player to make sure they werent taking shifts with their friends (bannable)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My current response to it is...<br />
****ocks.<br />
<br />
Well to be honest I cant remeber the whole thing and I only re-read the first chapter.<br />
<br />
But in responce to the first chapter....****ocks.<br />
<br />
Im now a regular on Tallon...and I enjoy pk situations...I enjoy having to fight for a spawn...I enjoy deing and having to scoot then come back after an hour and catch the @#%$ by surprise and win the spawn back.<br />
<br />
But i don not PK indiscriminately...I did not play on this server purely to pk.<br />
<br />
My character is not a murderer and a &quot;world&quot; made up of solely murderers is ...well Rallos or Sullon in my oppinion.<br />
<br />
i came to pve....but with an added hardship. With the worry of having to fight other players as well as mobs...but only when the situation demands it.<br />
<br />
My character is not a murderer...but he is a pker.<br />
<br />
Ill fight anyone in range to me.if there is a reason for it.<br />
<br />
But in relation to those that come to the server and cry at being pk'd...feck off bluebie its not the right server for ya.<br />

I agree, most of the PKers that think they're big and tough ARE the ones that're cowards. I don't understand, though, why you would want to keep running to your corpse and getting killed, though. Why not just log off for an hour or two? The guy's eventually going to get bored.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying all PKers are jerks, though. Usually the ones that're laid back are the nice ones. I consider myself to be neutral. I'll /duel someone as long as it'll be a friendly duel. If you use /duel to settle a problem, you're only going to create more.  Vall Shadowstrife<br />

So hmm ...the 4 pvp servers are what ? mistakes by verant ?<br />
I mean you play how you wanna play and you have the choice to play pvp or non-pvp and both options were given by the creaters of this game  there is no exact way the game was made to be played. ------------------------------------------------<br />

<br />
If the game was made for both options, why did they change almost everything about PvP as we knew it? Took out fearing players, took out charming players, took out armor looting(team servers), changed Level attack range, changed /con players, changed corpse camping policies, zone control policies, ect.....<br />
<br />
If you think the game was made for both options your sadly mistaken, and haven't been around long enough, or don't have a very good memory. EQ is blue, new games like ShadowBane, Horizons, even DAoC are taking PvP as a core. Though DAoC was still to blue for me.<br />
<br />
-PvP101 is one of the best things I have ever read. I read it about 2 years ago, or so, and I still love reading it.<br />
<br />
-Mellifleur, as per the blubie /dueling god, well dueling is dueling, PvP is a different story. BotB if faught with even gear/levels is when it shows the better player. BotB just shows who is higher level, better gear, and has some skill. Now I don't think anyone can win BotB without having some PvP skill, but even a novice PvP has a good chance at winning if he's 60, best gear there is, and has 12 advanced points. <br />
<br />
If you want to talk PvP thats a different story, Zek players know the tricks, sploits of PvP, have resist gear sets on them at all times, and travel wearing high resist gear, even more so with the PvP Teams servers, and most of all Pumice stones (I have 3-5 stones on me full charged at all times). Biggest factor, we PvP all the time. Team servers even more than RZ. RZ is more harsh at times with ganking, but over all amount of fighting Teams is where it's at. As a dark, if we see another team in range, we attack or get attacked, no questions asked. We don't worry about a bad rep for attacking, you get a bad rep on TZ/VZ/SZ for NOT attacking.<br />
<br />
Nice story too, goes really into the depth of PvP, hell if your on wisps island they must have been what? 10-14 in levels, yup there's your core PvP's. LOL    Zvanen Thex<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_darkudaos</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Majority of people on RZ are still normal everyday EQers, as concerned with levelling and gearing as any blubie. When we joined we might have had ganking in mind, but it becomes pretty obviouse fairly quickly that it's not all about ganking and looting items. There's honour, respect, friendship, teamwork, etc, and it has created a server far more enjoyable and rounded than any other, far superior to wall to wall ganking or a pvpless server. PvP is a way of dealing with the dishounerable, or settling disagreements more so than to gank items. To do the above actions of ganking and spawn stealing on RZ, with no reason other than 'because you can', would very quickly strip you a decent reputation, and any chance of uberness. It's not all cut-throat.</div></div><hr />

It is funny that both types of players still talk smack about each other, the whole &quot;carebear&quot; thing always makes me grin.  Unlike the early online games such as UO, it is a CHOICE for players to go PVP.  Even though I personally chose against a PVP server, I do respect the people that play there..and I agree with the idea that if a player wants to hang on Zek they better have the right mindset before stepping foot there.</div></div><hr />

we all know dying sucks, no matter how it happens, and so does getting your corpse camped. you know for a fact that if you just finished trying to kill the toughest mob in youjr life, it has 10hp left, and you cant barely move from lack of health, then, whats this, someone comes up and stabs you in the back. it sucks, it just plain sucks, but you deal with it. but we all know, that when that happens, you will be heard to yell @#$!.<br />
<br />
and2, you dont own the place, you never have, you never will. this is not boot camp. if you want to fnd out what ownage is, try getting summoned and binded to veeshans peak by a crazed GM. thats ownage, not you pretending to be king on a player vs player server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Yetah Apnarg</div><div class="date">05-29-02, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A MUCH better version:<br />
<br />
&quot;EQPvP 101 The Basics: Attitude<br />
<br />
For those just starting on a Zek Server <br />
<br />
Lesson 1: I came here to annoy people<br />
<br />
Repeat after me, 'I came here to annoy people'<br />
<br />
If you are not here to kill and harass other players until they cancel their account, take your blubie ass to Friendly Ro, Mithaniel Campsalot, Happy Thule, or better yet just move to Bostwana, because they don’t have Everquest there and most have never even seen a video game. You can live the rest of your life without anyone calling you a “gay homo fag”, so you can build up your self esteem enough to get a girlfriend. As every Everquest player knows, having a girlfriend is the most important RL quality you can possess, so if you have one be sure to mention her as much as possible over /guildchat and during /ooc smacktalk. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lesson 2: Somebody called me gay. How did they know about my experience at summer camp? I was pre-pubescent and just experimenting, so it doesn’t really count… right?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You are an insignificant WORM. Everquest is not for WORMS, it’s for MEN. In fact I don’t think any video games have yet been made for worms, not even WORMS. So plan on people talking @#%$, plan on having your sexuality questioned, plan on seeing the word “the” misspelled. <br />
<br />
When people talk @#%$, are you just going to listen and go back to gaining XP? No, you miserable shell of fossilized worm feces, that would be playing the game the wrong way. Remember, WORM, you did not come here to slay dragons, you came here to DESTROY the self confidence of others. The sooner you get it through your bluebie head that you are an ANIMAL and REALIZE that this is what you wanted to be, the more MENACING you will become. You are not a gawky teenager playing Everquest, you are a FIERCE AND SCARY beast! You’re a MAN! RAWWWRRRR!<br />
<br />
If somebody calls you a homosexual and claims to have had sex with your mother for a modest amount of money, stand up for yourself and tell them that they are, in fact, the true homosexual, and that the claims of your mother exchanging sex for money were a thinly veiled attempt at covering up the fact that their mother is a prostitute. <br />
<br />
<br />
Lesson 3: You just got PK’ed, what now?<br />
<br />
<br />
Aweee, did Mister Meanie come gank you and take your spawn? Do you want a tissue? Super soft or regular strength? With or without aloe? What’s the difference? It doesn’t matter. Nobody cares about you, WORM. That spawn now belongs to Mister Meanie, because he is better than you. Nobody cares that you died. Want to cry? Go ahead, maggot, nobody will listen except to laugh. Just like when Dad laughed at you when you said you wanted a My Little Pony playhouse for your 11th birthday, and nobody cared about what you really wanted, and mom said “Tony I don’t want you to be so different” and you said “mom I just want the ponies because they’re cool and I like horses!”<br />
<br />
“My final answer is no Tony, your father agrees with me”<br />
<br />
“That’s right son, I don’t want no boy of mine playing with pink horses”<br />
<br />
“but all my friends like horses and Julie said…”<br />
<br />
“ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE GIRLS, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? CAN’T YOU GO PLAY BASEBALL OR SOMETHING NORMAL? QUIT CRYING!”<br />
<br />
“Oh Dan you’ve really hurt his feelings”<br />
<br />
“GET YOUR PANSY ASS TO YOUR ROOM! I can’t stand to watch you cry.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lesson 4: You are at the bottom of the food chain<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Welcome to Zek, Mister Worm. You will eat dirt and like it. As an insignificant worm, you are supposed to like dirt. After all, you gather your life-giving nutrients from organic material in the dirt, which makes bacteria grow in your gut. As the dirt passes through your body, the bacteria in your stomach is added to the soil. Plants can then grow bigger and stronger with the bacteria-rich soil, and animals who eat the plants will be more healthy, and animals who eat the animals that eat plants will get more food, and so on. We would like to thank you, Mister Worm, for building the foundation of our wonderful world! But remember, as a worm, you are on the bottom of the food chain. We could crush you at any time we want, and while that will only weaken the foundation of our world and eventually lead to our demise, we don’t have the foresight to realize this. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You may ask, who are ‘We’? We are the first generation players of the Zek servers who run this place. We have eight times the amount of /played time that you do. Our guild sold enough plat on playerauctions to purchase each member a toilet-chair. Think of this as a jail cell, and we run the block. Or better yet, imagine it as a high-school, and we’re the bullies. Except instead of hanging out in the weight room, we hang out in the A/V room. <br />
<br />
And if we can’t kill you because you’re out of range, hiding, on the same team, or whatever? We’re the Gods of this server, it doesn’t matter. We can stare at you menacingly. We can say really mean things. Just remember, you EARN the right to breathe, and eat something else besides dirt. You EARN this right by being tougher then the people who are telling you that you don’t have this right. You EARN your respect, and your reputation. You EARN the right to stop being a worm, and start being a rat.<br />
<br />
When you actually move up from Worm to Rat, you own the worms. Just be careful, because some worms have cats as friends who like to eat Rats who get too big for their ability to produce death. If this happens, I suggest making some dog friends. Or better yet, a monkey/dog/machine gun hybrid friend that could kill dogs, cats, rats and worms with its semi-automatic laser beam arms. That would be awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lesson 5: The man’s game<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So you’re mad that somebody killed you when you were low on health? You’ve obviously learned nothing, worm. Go back and read lesson 2. <br />
PvP servers are not for pansies. It takes a strong MAN to play this game, and in no way is it for pansies. Did you hear that dad? I’m playing a tough man’s game! I don’t need girl toys! I’M NOT A PANSY DAD, I’M TOUGH!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I’M TOUGH!! <br />
<br />

The whole blueby thing is quite funny.  Considering that most Best of the Best have been won by non PvP server characters.  That Elite Jail cell PvP didnt help all that much.<br />

The only place where it was legal to train trakanon to zone-in while other/same team raid forces arrived.<br />
<br />
Apparently all the PnP stuff is gone off the other zeks (so I hear).  Hopefully it is going well.  PnP has no place on a pvp server.  There is no backing off.  My god has given me the specific mandate to kill you.  I kill you, I stand on your corpse and kill you again when you come for it.  Then with a little luck, I kill your friends when they come to help, and camp their corpses as well.  You get me, I bring all the biggest mobs I can find in the zone to welcome your friends, then resume camping your corpses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hows that xp loss taste?&quot;<br />
<br />
But I digress.  The only annoying thing about sullon is being caught with a load of plat on yourself, lom, low on health, and having to flee from a fight.  I've only seen more bull**** while driving by a dairy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I pwned you.  Tell your friends you got pwned by a green druid&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you couldn't pwn your way out of a paper bag.  Stay there, I'll be right back&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;haha, loser!  my supermodel girlfriend is asking me to log off, c-ya wuss&quot;<br />
<br />
Not trying to build up Sullon.  It just seemed ludicrous to me after playing on Sullon for a while that play nice policies were in place on other Zeks.  Why not only enable PvP in the arena...  Oh wait, they did on the blue servers.  Hoping the transition is working well for you folks (if that rumor is true).<br />

<br />
P.S if you have a lvl 60 char on RZ i think your a moron and dont plan on really enjoying the game for what it was meant for......i just play my RZ ranger when i feel like slumming:P<br />
<br />
would rather be on a server where a monk can actually wear his fungi tunic and consider himself safe:P<br />
<br />
P.S.S if you ever see my ranger everwood on RZ be sure to kill me and know that 20seconds later i will just log too my 56 ranger on ECI with full ToV and let you simmer on that while trying not to get PKed for the 6th time that day:P<br />

&quot; PvP players waste more time on this game that ANY other player on blue server&quot; -lane<br />

<br />
Sorry if you like a game where the only challenge is to overcome the horribly unimpressive NPC AI.<br />
<br />
I play a lvl 60 cleric on Rallos Zek.  I have nice gear.  (tov stuff, that shard from burrower, etc)  My guild earned the right to doing all of this stuff because for a few months there was an allout war between a few guilds.  The victors remain on the server, the losers mostly went to legends or quit.  Yep, we missed out on doing some of the big stuff first because we were pvping.  So?  That's another part of the game that I happen to enjoy.  Does that mean we waste time?  Not if we enjoy it.  Currently there's very few things my guild hasn't killed, and after this weekend hopefully Emp will be eating dirt and we'll be on to VT.  Have fun with your 56 ranger tho :/<br />

Why do PvP servers lose? Why do blubie servers win? Because we have fun doing other things besides leveling and raiding, and it's true, we don't have as good gear for the  most part. I remember back when I played on Tallon my guild went in to kill Naggie....we all buffed up, and we're about to kill when &quot;uberguild_01&quot; comes and starts a 50vs50 war.....so what happens? My guild gets wiped. What happens next? &quot;Uberguild_02&quot; comes in and whipes out &quot;uberguild_o1&quot;. How much fun is that? Very much fun I can say. Different people like different things....personally, I like PvP servers. I LOVE being able to kill the person who killed me last week...revenge is a sweet thing. I LOVE being able to kill the person who repeatedly trains the zone time after time, and you know the GM's won't do crap about it (or by the time they do, it's 12 hours  later and he's already logged). And the people on this post aren't trying to say that you aren't playing &quot;real eq&quot; by playing on a blue server. We're not saying that we're any better than you cause it's harder for us to level. That's something we chose. ALL this post is trying to say is....you come to our server, DO NOT whine after you die, because it will happen. That's what makes us the most upset   Infact, I got killed last night by an enchanter who had Yvolcarn in CS dire charmed.....sheesh did that suck. I had just received KEI, and was about to do some massive leveling   But what do you do? Gather your things and move on. That's all we're asking. Don't whine, just play, it makes the game much more fun....but believe me....one week later, when you see that person, you'd better get your revenge!!!<br />

Lady Daegarmo...if you know what i mean... was the person who supported PvP and tried to help all the pvpers. He also tried to get more support for pvpers etc and make sure they werent ignored. <br />

<br />
::grins:: Never traded with the pointy eared ones. And I'll remind ye the Shanks began in the Safehouse, we were born here in roleplay and always have been one of the unofficial Safehouse guilds along with some others that are no longer with us.<br />
<br />
Lastly, specific server issues/guild politics don't belong here. So if ye have a bone to pick do it elsewhere.<br />

<br />
The points made were true for the most part except on one aspect, when you talk about pvp team server. Everyone and their mother knows (inserted a cool expression here) that Vallon / Tallon Zek are now BLUEBIE. Yes i say bluebie cause the original poster was right on when using that word. Blubiness is players not playing a pvp server for what it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here a brief History of Vallon Zek (im pretty sure Tallon Zek has similar history)<br />
<br />
the first year: It once was a pvp team serve were each teams were pvping against each others. The gold year as refered by another poster earlier in this thread. Pretty much of all the original poster said was true and we would live by thoses rules for the most fun ever to be had in EQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
The second year:  Resulting of the human team, dwarf team and elf team getting their butts handed back to them by the inkie-ogre-troll team aka Dark team, some people saw in the server coding a way to exploit, even better since it would not be punished (Sony being the morons they are), by making a permanent alliance of the 3 teams. The great bluebiness, Defiant, was Born. The 3 Xteamers era begun and things started to degrade.<br />
<br />
<br />
The last year: Resulting of the Dark team getting their butts handed back to them by the 3teamers guild, taking their pride in having broken every rules with Sony not doing a crap about it, the majority of the Dark team decided it was time to fight back the hard way as a 4-team, losing all the honor they had in doing so. Aka Torrent and Aduentus.<br />
<br />
                     -----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now we made a good overview of history, we all see how ALL of theses players did not abide by the first rule our previous poster: It is a pvp team server, you did not come here to do dragons or anything else other than PVP team. You come here to kill. No one learned it cause they all took the means to screw up one of the best server out there being the bluebies they are cause they could not do their dragons, dungeons etc.. or even pvp for the sake of their own team. They HAD to act like bluebies and do their dragons, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE NEW LESSON YOU NEED TO ABIDE TO NOW AS A PVPER:<br />
<br />
You get killed by a bunch of theses bluebies? 3 otpions:<br />
<br />
- You come back at them until they die. At least while they have to care of you, they dont anything else bluebie. HT, manaburn, lifeburn become a necessity to strike fear in them and be sure you can kill even without your gear. Even mr phat l33T will drop like a fly.<br />
<br />
- You do wait... once they start fight x mob , you jump them and proceed to show them what the truth of xp loss is. Of course it is mean, you are a killer and you can do it. You are not here to do friendly gaming since that will get you to sit afk all day in pop. They wil ask you to do it, but hey, fact is you DO NOT have to obey them. Did they not screw up your server anyways?<br />
<br />
- Once you kill them, you wait conveniently that they come back at their corpse. You KILL them again. Rince and repeat at least one more time. Yes yes, they will say crap to you and complain alot but you CAN do it. Sure will have your ennemy be hard on you at your next encounter but you are rdy for that. Is he? Bluebie will think twice next time before attacking you, attackin you will soon be synonym of having to deal with you the 3 next hours in his head. He is a bluebie, he want to kill dragons and xp before anything else. You on the other side don't care about xp, dragon and loot, you just want to kill him...<br />
<br />
- Try apply all the previous even if you are the one who owned your ennemies since the start. Make them understand meeting you is 3 deaths guaranteed, if not xp deaths. You are a killer, not a bluebie. YOU CARE NOT. Repeat, you care not! You have no heart, you kil kill kill.. faster you learn that, the more you will kill and less you will be killed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thoses are the new rules now for the real pvper out there on Vallon.</div></div><hr />
