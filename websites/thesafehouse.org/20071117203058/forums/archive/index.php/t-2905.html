I was expecting something along the lines of &quot;The Complete Book of &quot; series, I suppose, but there seemed to be something lacking from S&amp;amp;S.<br />

<br />
one of my main problems is the direction they've gone with prestige classes - where they started out as something with wide applications that a variety of classes could fill, they've now become nothing more than kits.<br />
<br />
want a fire mage? make a fire lord prestige class. a druid that likes shapechanging? shapechanger prestige class. a paladin who focuses more on clerical aspects than battle? become a hospitaler!<br />
<br />
I totally agree with monte cook, wotc is already slipping back into TSR &quot;let's print anything and everything we possibly can, and milk every single idea possible until there're so damn many books out that DMs get sick of all the random feats that they have to go back to only allowing the core books!&quot; syndrome.<br />
<br />
the best stuff is coming off the independent publishers, particularly monte's malhavoc press.<br />

In fact, I think S&amp;amp;S is rather one of the better ones. ShadowCross Bladesong<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nyssa Rainwhisper</div><div class="date">02-25-02, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Elerion it's the 3rd ed Bard/Rogue book.  I've found it pretty useful so far, but then again I just started playing pen &amp;amp; paper D&amp;amp;D back in July so I'm not really one who is qualified to critique on the book.  My character isn't even high enough to use half the skills mentioned in the book, but sifting through it helped me understand my character class a bit more than just the general player's guide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">02-25-02, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found most of the prestige classes to be hit or miss. Some flat stink, some are good, and some are only good for as specific campaign.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think they are better than kits, since kits tended to be so off-kilter balance-wise. Some of the prestige kits do that, but at least you're always &quot;paying&quot; with a level of your character to get the abilities.<br />
<br />
Pretty much, I just use a few prestige classes to fit my campaign world, and make up a few to fit the niches I need.<br />
<br />
and, Masters of the Wild is the best of the class flatbooks so far. It is more well rounded and has some more interesting and useful classes and feats and such than the other books.<br />

It seemed to lack any real heart or imagination.  It was more just another way to get more Prestige classes out into circulation I think.  <br />
<br />
Oh well.  I guess I will just stick with what I am doing now and make stuff up as I go along.</div></div><hr />

DM - Okay, you see a Bodak around the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Me - Okay, I shut my eyes and go beat on it.<br />
<br />
DM - You what? Uh, okay, but you realize you'll be at like -20 to hit...<br />
<br />
Me - Well, I would be, except for my Blindsight.  I don't think I'll bother the party, they've got better things to do.<br />

Their primary mode of attack is a Gaze attack which causes Instant Death, SV Fortitude with a DC of I think 15.<br />
<br />
Their only other mode of attack is relatively weak melee, but that's okay - when you can instantly kill anything you look at, you don't need to carry a big sword too.  One failed save = doom.<br />
<br />
And Kev - nah, they were in Monster Manual I, from 3rd Ed.</div></div><hr />
