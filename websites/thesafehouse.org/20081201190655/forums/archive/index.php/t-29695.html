We have guildees from all spheres and levels, and are commited to having plenty of fun and working together as a team while doing so. We encourage active play, and our goals include experiencing high level raiding content upon release of it, yet keep RL as a priority. We have no age requirements, but maintain a mature member base. Right now we are out there having fun together, and preparing for the next stage in the game. We are also accepting crafters and diplomats to join us, provided they have end-game in mind as well.<br />
