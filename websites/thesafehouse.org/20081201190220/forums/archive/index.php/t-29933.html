Well, it was broken pre-bug patch.  I don't know if it still is or not, but the only way we could get it to complete was this - <br />
<br />
Person who wants quest degroups, hails guy, gets ownership of tahir.  From that point on, just kill everything - kill the 2 adds, then kill tahir (who just goes poof) and then kill his ghostie.  Tahir respawns while the ghostie is being killed, so tank both mobs at once or the quester goes splat, he auto agros the quester.  Once ghost is dead, kill tahir again.  This repeats, the ghost coming up the stairs in order from left to right, if your back is where tahir normally spawns).  Should happen 3 times.  The last ghost and main dude have some sort of weird time control thing and get all their health back and then lose it again, it's just a long fight.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat for all in group.  Maybe even bring 2 groups.  We did it 11 timnes in a row, and it took us about 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Now, post bug patch:  I don't see Tahir up all the time, so maybe it works per group now, and you do not need to degroup (which also means you can't chain repeat quest).<br />
<br />
The walkthrough should hold true still, minus the degrouping part.</div></div><hr />
