<br />
I picked Divine Intervention. it last for about 2.5 min. Adds about +25 dmg when it procs during that time. It can be used again in 30 min. I am kind of wishing I picked something else but hey. That is what I got and no tuning back. If their are other times in game when you get several choices like this it may a good idea for others to post them. That we can better educated decisions.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to let folks know that we're aware of the issue of characters not receiving their traits, traditions, and tactics properly. We've got the issue corrected on our development server, but we want to test the system for a while before it goes live.<br />
 <br />
When the update goes to the live servers, everyone's trait/tradition/tactics choices will be reset and will need to be made again. This means you will be able to make different choices if you so desire.<br />
 <br />
Sorry for the inconvenience.<br />

I picked the +hp ogre trait, and I only gained 16 or 18 hp. The most useful one I've heard about is the dark elf hide skill, and that would just be for bathroom afks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joonling</div><div class="date">11-28-04, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I chose Precision Combat...I got a combat skill called &quot;dancing feet&quot; or something or other.  It allows me to parry.  Not sure if I want to kepe this.  Maybe I'll rechoose after the patch.<br />
<br />
Edit = Dancing feet is not the attack I got for Precision Combat.  I actually got another combat skill actually named Precision Combat with a poision dipped dagger as the icon.  I do &quot;bashing&quot; dmg when I turn it on; lasts for nearly 3.00 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">11-29-04, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">18 is a racial trait so not specific for rogues.  As a gnome I took a fire proc I mainly use it for close fights or Boss fights since timer is long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-29-04, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took the ratongan poison proc ability and haven't really noticed much of a difference yet.<br />
<br />
Are the stat/resist racial trait increases you get at 18 permanent or just timed abilities?  I'm talking about the level 18 one, not the level 8 and 12 ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tannier</div><div class="date">11-29-04, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The question is &quot;do proc abilities stack?&quot;<br />
<br />
As a bard I have a proc ability from a song.  If getting an additional proc does not stack, it would be a worthless skill for me.<br />
<br />
When I had the choice I took the one that lets me heal faster out of combat.  Have not had to use it yet other than as a test but I figured at some point it would save me some debt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-29-04, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should stack.  My poison and racial trait power both appeared as active buffs (one didn't overwrite the other or anything).</div></div><hr />
