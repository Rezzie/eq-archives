<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, my main is a lvl 12 natural scrapper with martial arts and super reflexes.  I have also taken Swift from the Fitness power pool in order to get stamina down the line.<br />
<br />
BUT I'm confused as to which travel power to go for.  I don't want to fly, because that just doesn't work with my character (looks like Shaft).  So...what advice do those of you who've used these powers have?  I've been told that hurdle is useless, super jump is amazing (jumping over buildings?), and that hover is ok to get to the top of something, but it's too slow to use as a travel aid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well for travel you've got three options - Flight, Super Jumping, or Teleportation.  Since you've got Martial Arts and Super Reflexes then Super Jump might be the most in-tune with your other abilities, but if you're of Natural origin you could simply say your character got a hold of a Rikti teleportation or flight device and that's how he travels.  If you're of magic origin then maybe teleportation is the way to go (cast a spell - 'poof', you're in a new spot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a usefulness perspective, I would suggest Super Jump.<br />
<br />
Not because of the cool factor of the Jumping (which it really is fun)... but because of the defense from combat leaping... Its no endurance and gives you a hover like benefit (which if your going to be in melee... is a good thing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, 99% of the benefit of hover is to get up out of melee range.<br />
<br />
Combat Jumping does give the defensive benefit, but doesn't get you out of range. Of course, as a Scrapper, that doesn't help very much, does it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Combat jumping is a rather nice def. boost even with just the default slot, plus it makes you immune to immobilize, and cancels any immobilize you have on you.  Something to have when fighting those guys who make the hentai tentecles come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, as a Scrapper I wouldn't want to get out of melee range unless I was running (or jumping) away.  I'll probably delve a bit into the Super Jump category then, which is kind of what I was thinking of doing anyway.<br />
<br />
Is hurdle kind of useless?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you've taken swift then don't bother with hurdle - swift and hurdle are pretty much just a means to get health and stamina later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hurdle is nice enough if you need a prereq for Stamina and have chosen Super Speed as your travel power (and thus don't particularly need Swift).<br />
<br />
If you're looking specifically for a jump power though, Combat Jumping is clearly superior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">combat jump plus hurdle is nice as you gain levels. especially if you dont want a travel power early on.<br />
<br />
that said,since you took swift, your really better off getting combat leaping if you want super leap.<br />
<br />
plus combat leap does give general defensive bonuses.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have found though,that your selection is limited. you cant really take a travel power,and still get stamina at 20,unless your going to sacrifice some of your primary/secondary powers.<br />
<br />
Given that PB is probably the single best power of the reflexes secondary,and you get dodge at 16 id suggest putting off your travel power,unless you really have to have it.</div></div><hr />
