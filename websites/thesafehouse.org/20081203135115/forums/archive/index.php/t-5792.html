<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Durden</div><div class="date">05-23-01, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They were all tired.  They had gathered quickly from all around Norrath to help a friend.  What was to be training exercise, had turned into the real thing by a twist of luck.<br />
<br />
The adventurers stayed wary as they waited for word from the expert team pulling the target.  The target had been missed once when she was helped suddenly by passing undead.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Durden was startled from his reverie.  &quot;Coercer Q'iuol incoming!!!!&quot; the shout rang out pulling the group closer together and more alert then before.  They waited in the darkness to see Ysskar, Kadina and Icetiger leading the Coercer Q'iuol to the group, and to her death.<br />
<br />
And it would be sweet pay back striping the Robe of the Kedge off her lifeless body for what she and her evil darkelves had done to Kadina and Icetiger a few hours before.<br />
<br />
The battle was short and sweet, victory was in the air as the group squeezed the last breaths out of her body.<br />
<br />
Then it was all over.<br />
<br />
And Stanos was pleased. <br />
<br />
I'd like to thank everyone that was in Kiticor last night.  Everyone commited to killing the Coercer before we even knew that she was wearing a Robe of the Kedge.  The killing force was Drawde, Kilmar, Merekai, Fjord, Kellerin, Glip, Nerran, Kadina, Anastazia, Fallenone, Venric, Worthing, Razim, Ysskar, Morpheos, Quell, Arasmus, Taylen, Icetiger and Corwil.<br />
<br />
Thank you all.<br />
<br />
If anyone is intersted in a mushier account of the event, they can check out the post I made at Hawkwood's.<br />
<br />
But specific to the Safehouse, I'd really like to thank Glip and Wixramiablo for all the help they've given me over the last 2 years.  Damn that's a long time to play the same game!<br />

<br />
As said above, great to see some true rogues gaining such a possession, you've certainly been around and did enough for Rodcet's rogue community to deserve it, Durden.<br />
<br />
Also, as Glip mentioned, about damn time    How long ago did you kill the General?<br />

See, I'm much more devious when I check Safehouse from school (but I'm out now. Mwahaha).  I had a teacher who never dated her passes.  So I took full advantage of that.</div></div><hr />

I can hear the voice, but I don't want to listen. Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright. I can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice and make everything alright.</div></div><hr />
