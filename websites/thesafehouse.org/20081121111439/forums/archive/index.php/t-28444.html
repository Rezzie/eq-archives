That quest has been bugged since I first tried completing it back in beta 3..I spent about 2 weeks at ToD just to hopefully finish the quest..First of all,Kraelix usually took about 3-4 tries until he finally got summoned.You had to kill the gargoyles,and allow the summoners to summon Kraelix before attacking them..Make sure your out of aggro range,otherwise the summoners will lose concentration somehow and attack you..Once that happened before kraelix was summoned,well then you'd have to wait for everything to reset and try again..It's a pain in the ass,but this quest has been bugged since September lol..<br />
<br />
And verleguut does drop the poweder of dailuk so u can sumon him,but the next part of the purify quest has u summon Xarkrafi..Good luck  with that too..After defeating kraelix,he's &quot;supposed&quot; to drop this amulet/rune whatever to use with the voidrender wand to summon xarkrafi..I must have killed kraelix about 10 times at least and he only dropped this rune once :o( And he's supposed to drop it EVERY TIME..I'm not sure if they at least fixed that.<br />
<br />
I play on Varking and i'm one of the good guys..its kinda tough fighting in ToD since alot of darkies are around,which is why i havent tried doing the quest yet..<br />
<br />
I swear,sigil should restrict pvp to wilderness only,so we can all do dungeon runs in peace.. *sighs* its so damn annoying getting ganked by a group of darkies just waiting until you pull a few mobs..Its definitely not fun,,but w.e..As soon as we are allowed to transfer,I'm going to the RP server.I believe most people on varking will do the same if the pvp system isnt changed..Right now its just ridiculous and full of chaos..It's not fun for anyone except for the few people 12-20 levels higher  than everyone else killing people repeatedly,and the ones lucky enough to gank people as their fighting in dungeons..Its retarded!<br />
<br />
I'm a fan of &quot;true pvp&quot; but this is not fun pvp at ALL</div></div><hr />

Oh sweet god please no!  Florendyl is already overly crowded with people who don't actually RP last thing we need are pissed off PVPers -cries-  PLEASE SIGIL Fix PVP servers before server transfers!</div></div><hr />

That was a little rude friend..How can you say that when you know nothing about me? I'm not some wet behind the ear child griefer that loves to gank and corpse camp people..I'm what you call an actual honorable pvper.I &quot;dont believe&quot; in dishonorable pvp.I NEVER attack ANYONE who is 2-3 levels lower than me unless they attack first..Normally I wouldn't even go out of my way to kill someone,simply because pvp at this time is pointless..I'm more worried about leveling than pvping..<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact,the main reason I chose to play on a pvp server was for something else to do other than grinding all the time..A change of pace hobby If you will..<br />
<br />
Believe me,I can roleplay any character and class I choose..I do read fantasy novels I'm fascinated with fantasy..<br />
<br />
Just because I'm not happy with the current pvp implementation does NOT MEAN I'm some immature,griefing,corpse camping,idiotic child..  <br />
<br />
I apologize If my previous post made it seem that way..<br />

I log into a PvP server and would be killed 2436708672360978672737409623 times before hitting 2nd level.  Probably by some 50th level guy camping the newbie grounds. :/<br />

No PvP for me thanks.</div></div><hr />

You kill some gargoyles, then some wolves, then some more gargoyles, then Kraelix, and he drops the rune that you use with the voidrender.  However, he only drops 1, so the whole group has to stay together for the final part in the bottom of the temple.<br />
<br />
However, as of about 2 weeks ago, that part didn't work.  We cleared the room, used the voidrender, and the room repopped.  2 gargoyles pathed into the center, we killed them, then nothing happened.  The event just got stuck.<br />
<br />
Also, PLEASE NOTE, you have to have all the pieces to start the event - ie the voidrender, the rune from kaelix, AND the 4 little things like the covenent writ, hound fur, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kraelix:<br />
<br />
There are two wolves near the summoners, kill both wolves and approach the summoners, you should get a &quot;Summoners are chanting&quot; message on the top of the screen.<br />
<br />
Two gargoyle-alike mobs will spawn, kill both and approach the summoners until you get a new screen message (Summoners are not KoS, don't be shy)<br />
<br />
Two more will spawn, do as above until Kraelix spawns, he will drop one quest item.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Regarding ToD - if you kill the named ghost at the &quot;end&quot; of the ToD, think it's the north end, he will drop a dust to summon a huge named inside one of the crypts.</div></div><hr />
