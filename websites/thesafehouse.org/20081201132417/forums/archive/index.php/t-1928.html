<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mardoc the Dwarf</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do people deal with this rubbish called life?  How do people enjoy living when all they do is work or school.<br />
<br />
My schedule for instance:<br />
Monday - School , Home, Homework (school at home), Sleep<br />
Tuesday - Same<br />
Wensday Same, but at Church before sleep.<br />
Thursday - Same as Mon/Tuesday<br />
Friday - School , Home, Friends house (spent doing nothing), Sleep<br />
Saturday - Chores, Homework, Sleep<br />
Sunday - Church, Chores, Homework, Sleep<br />
and repeat.<br />
<br />
And now once I graduate from highschool, I move on to college and do the same thing, but pay for it.<br />
<br />
Then I move into the business would, and do the same thing, but now I have the added troubles of bills, children, wife, taxes, ect. <br />
<br />
Why is this what is set up for me to live?  Why do I work to graduate when all I'm going to &quot;break free&quot; from one prison to another?<br />

<br />
Quote:Matthew 6:5<br />
<br />
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<br />
<br />
6:6<br />
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last I checked, most churches were on street corners. You don't want to be a hypocrite do you?<br />

<br />
Mardoc might or might not be able to choose what he does though, depending on age and family. Church stuff, charity work, sunday school, stuff that gets you involved with other people and doing stuff to keep your mind from wnadering tends to be great for people who are depressesed, though. That is, if you're one who enjoys church related stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That particular verse does seem to be in conflict with much of the rest of the testament, vis-a-vis the whole &quot;spread the word&quot; and &quot;witness&quot; thing.  But that is only if one takes a very literal interpretation of what it is saying (a fault usually attributed to christians by their non-christian detractors)<br />
<br />
If one reads it as a comment on the sincerity of one's motivation as a believer being what is really important, then it works out.  Those who are into the religion because it is the socially respectable thing to do, or because they feel a need to be &quot;one up&quot; on their fellow man by being -more- devout (at least by external appearances) than he is are not particularly good Christians.  A truly good Christian is motivated by neither of those things, and would continue to pray/be good even if the eyes of his fellows were not on him.  For example, if he were shut up in his closet with the lights out and the door closed.   <br />
<br />
The very conspicuousness that is derided by this verse (if it is motivated by ego) is condoned, however, if it is motivated by love and concern for one's fellow man, and the desire to save his eternal soul from damnation.  <br />
<br />
Or so I read it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly how my father read it, and me too. You don't NEED to go to church. If people tell you that you NEED to go or you will go to hell, they are full of it.<br />
<br />
You can go for social reasons if you LIKE to go. Nothing wrong with that. Hell, I went to more than a dozen Fellowship of Christian Athletes meetings while I was the president of the college atheist club, purely for social reasons. Didn't stand up and sing all the time, and certainly didn't pray. But it was a good time with interesting discussions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well no, you don't NEED to go. <br />
<br />
If you are just going so that it makes you look good, then those verses would apply.<br />
<br />
But as a general rule of thumb, the bible places a large amount of importance on fellowship with likeminded believers, etc., so Its a bit off the mark to say Don't Go.<br />
<br />
But I don't think removing church from the schedule is neccesarily the first, best or only method to use here. If he wasn't a believer, maybe it would be, but you can't assume he places your same low priority on church attendence. After all, you are an athiest, and I'm assume he is not.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt see it that way, for most people college is the best time of their life. I'm on in community college waiting to transfer to a 4 year school and I'm already starting to love life outside of highschool.<br />
<br />
As for church, I haven't gone in years (attended regularly in years at least) but that's because I dont like the only church that is close to here. My whole family goes and I stay home on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Something about the pastor driving a Lexus and purchasing a brand new 9 bedroom house for him and another one for his mother, it bugs me. The time he made a point in front of the service that he was wearing an Armani suit it was the last ***** for me.<br />

I'll start going again when I can find a pastor who cares more about the people going to the church then the amount of money he is making.</div></div><hr />

Being serious, the secret is to do things that you can find pleasure in. Indeed one of my favourite jobs I've ever had was being a trash collector. I've just found that positive happy people, find positive happy elements to whatever they do.

<br />
I have often casualy considered suicide, but I defer, because the possibilities of what might happen when I die scare me too much. I don't say that to make anyone feel sorry for me or to look cool or anything. But it sure would seem easier if I could just die, and go somewhere better.  <br />

Doesn't matter what's actually in the blank. It's just that, for some people, death requires the least amount of effort. Hence why suicide is considered by some to be a cop-out. Personally, I think that's making the entire situation too simplistic, but overall the logic in the first two sentences of this paragraph applies.<br />

What i've found to work is to just stop caring. Relax, enjoy life, and do what makes you feel good. If that's church, go 7 days a week, it doesn't matter. In the end, it doesn't matter what you've accomplished, as long as you had a good time doing so.<br />

<br />
Seriously, Life will only be meaningful if you make sure that it is. Part of that is gaining self-confidence and putting love and care into everything that you do. It's about achieving balance between worrying too much about the little things, and not caring at all.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to go for oppurtunities to do amazing things, even if you know you'll pay for it down the line. When you work (or get swamped by homework) , do it in knowing that the work IS meaningful and that you are getting something out of it.<br />
<br />
We grow up, we go to school, we work, but it doesn't have to be bad, and there is definitely a lot more out there. High school is only a very small part. <br />
<br />
Anyway, about suicide, I do think its a cop out. Theres no reason to be looking THAT much forward to being reincarnated as a sea sponge. <br />
<br />
If you end up being seventy, living in a hotel room in atlantic city, mooching off money from the three families that you have abandoned over the course of your life and gambling it all away, consider it then. but not before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me, HS was kinda just coasting.  I'm fairly good at school so didn't need a lot of effort and just kinda hung around in the extra time.  College was 4 years of hard work.  When they say that you earn your degree, it's through blood sweat and tears.<br />
<br />
That said, you don't need 100 on everything to get into a good college, get a good degree, and get a good job.  First, as medic will point out, most college degrees are just to prove that you can get a degree.  The exceptions are usually medical degrees, engineering, and scientist degrees where you'll probably get a job in your field.  That said, you can't slack off and expect to learn.  You have to understand how you learn and play to your advantages, (though this really isn't a big deal till college).<br />
<br />
After you get out, I can't speak for long term experience since I've only been out a few months and but I'm enjoying it.  I have fun at the work I do.  I have money.  And I have from 5pm to 7am and all weekends to do whatever the hell I want.  (Love the federal government employment.)<br />
<br />
As for religion, I didn't realize it's full use until my my sophomore year in HS.  I didn't go to Mass my freshman year.  My sophomore year I decided to go on my own and try to pay attention and learn from it and it definately helped a lot.  It's a decision you have to make for yourself.  And if you think you can skip it and pray completely on your own, you might consider it's not impossible to learn quantum physics, neurosurgery, or rocket engineering on your own, but it's a lot easier to be taught.  And that you can go to classes on the subjects and not pay attention and still learn nothing, coming away like you just wasted your time.  But most people would agree, going to classes, paying attention, and doing the suggested reading is the quickest, simplest, and easiest way to learn the subjects. --------------------------<br />
