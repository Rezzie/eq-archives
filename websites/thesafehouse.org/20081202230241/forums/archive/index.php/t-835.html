I like and respect Martha Stewart for the strong woman she is. She's gone through a painful divorce, lifted herself up by the bootstraps, and become one of the most powerful media-moguls in American history. Look how the media has portrayed other powerful self driven women... Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, Hillary Clinton, etc, etc. ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
The American public loathes a self-empowered woman. Pundits paint a picture that the slobbus americanus hold as a holy relic.<br />

Unless you have any personal dealings with a person, you be hard pressed to call them a &quot;bitch&quot; with much weight. I challenge you to name one &quot;powerful&quot; woman of Martha's caliber that the nation embraces.<br />

Well wtf is the media supposed to say? Excuse me, but they are there to be the eyes and ears of the people who cannot be in court that day. If a story says something, in theory they are supposed to say where it came from.<br />
<br />
If they said: &quot;Martha Stewart is a skanky ho who was rude on the telephone.&quot; ... I bet a ton of people would like to know who their source is. <br />
<br />
MANY journalists opt out of covering certain issues because they feel so passionately about them. But then again, some of them are just scumbags who ruin it for the rest of us hardworking, honest journalists and then people give ME a hard time because everyone hates the media. Dammit.

Powerful, successful women who dont have a male counterpart (as in politician husband, whatever) in this country are reviled. The only really visible woman who isnt is Oprah, and Oprah still annoys the hell out of me and a lot of other people. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, shes literally a billionaire, so maybe I should start a talk show and recommend books for a living.<br />
<br />
Martha, Madonna, Cristina, Britney, Condoleeza, Hillary, Rosie, Roseanne, etc etc etc all have their groups of people who hate them. Ether shes a bitch or a whore to a LOT of people.</div></div><hr />

I think your confusing powerful with &quot;Loud bitch&quot;.<br />
<br />
Why is it whenever someone breaks the law and they are either a woman or not of caucasian decent, there is always someone thats going to stand up and yell their treatment is 'racists' or 'sexist'.<br />
<br />
Do you think i have contempt for Michael Jackson cause hes black? (...well...whatever color he currently is).  No, I hold him in contempt cause he most likely sexually abused CHILDREN.

I said it was shameful the way the media's portrayal of her. SNL proved my point this weekend. The opening skit confirmed it.<br />

I happen to know people who have worked with her in Maine who find her a pleasure to work for. She's charitable and has a penchant for spoiling her employees. You don't hear those stories though, they don't fuel the fire.<br />
<br />
Quote:I think your confusing powerful with &quot;Loud bitch&quot;.<br />
And again you continue to prove my point. You seem to be hung up on media spin rather than facts. If you don't think any of the women I mentioned are powerful, you really need to stop reading Star magazine and understand how influential these women are. <br />

I'm not criticizing due process. I'm criticizing character assassination just because it's &quot;the in thing to do.&quot; I'll repeat it again. I NEVER SAID MARTHA STEWART WAS INNONCENT. I merely stated that media slanted prejudice is jackassery and a cult that most Americans fall for hook line and sinker.<br />

<br />
Essentially, she was convicted of covering up &quot;crimes&quot; that that the government didn't have enough evidence to prosecute her for. WTF? Trojan Horseshoes<br />
Need Help coming up with arguments against mine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The securities fraud charge was never going to stick, and I'd be shocked if the prosecutors really thought that it would.  This case is the poster child for complete and utter stupidity.  Had she admitted to the insider trading from the beginning, she woudl have been slapped with a fine, presumably made some sort of restitution to whomever she unloaded the shares on (either another investor or the market maker), and that would have been the end of it.  Instead, she lied to investigators and so got hit with these obstruction of justice charges.<br />
<br />
It continues to amaze me how someone with her knowledge of Wall Street (she worked there for a period of time) and her huge financial wealth, would a) have used insider information to save herself about $50k in the first place, and then b) tried to cover the whole thing up rather than accepting responsibility for what she did.<br />
<br />
What do I think should happen to her?  20 years in prison and a million dollar fine (the maximum penalties for both).  The public's faith in the integrity of financial markets is imperative, and yet time and again we see more reasons to doubt the system.  If people think that a multi-year prison sentence is in the cards for them, they may be a little less willing to blur the rules.  As an academic accountant, it makes me physically ill to see what our industry and the financial markets in general have gone through in the last several years.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the point of justice isn't to make examples of people as much as it is to mete out...well...justice, and the severity of her crimes are such that she'll spend no more than a year in prison and a bunch of months on probation.  She may be a sweet woman to work for, but this crap needs to stop.</div></div><hr />

It just goes to show you how weak the laws in this country are when it comes to white collar crimes.  If Koslowski, Ken Lay and Bernie Ebbers had been arrested with an ounce of pot, prosecutors would be able to make every charge stick, but since they only defrauded shareholders and pensioners of billions of dollars, they can get off scot-free.<br />

<br />
Martha.. wow.<br />
<br />
Nocte, I never saw much in the way of animosity towards her. At least not before she proved herself to be an arrogant bitch that feels she is not only superior to all those people that follow her like sheep, but that she should be above the laws that stop rich bitches from doing 'good ol boy' trading.<br />
<br />
I hate Bernie, and I hate his future Wife Martha. <br />
<br />
On the bright side, maybe they will be in the same prison and can get hitched right there. The only question is which one is the bigger selfish greedy thief. Would be like a bit title fight to see who can steal all of the other's posessions.<br />
