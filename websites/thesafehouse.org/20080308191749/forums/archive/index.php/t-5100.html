<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Daocsb</div><div class="date">06-13-02, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was think about making a Shadow Zerker but just wanted to know if they are good in RVR. This was what I was gonna make mine. I am gonna make him Norse and put 10 in str, 10 in con, and 5 in dex and quick. Might drop Con and just put 10 in dex in quick. (shrug)<br />
<br />
At lvl 50<br />
42 Axe<br />
42 Left Axe<br />
27 Env<br />
22 CS get PA<br />
40 Stealth<br />
<br />
I figure with a couple of realm ranks and +'s that you will get from equipment that I will get left axe and Axe up to 50 or close and stealth up to 50 or very close. Only reason to take PA up so high is to get the first damaging hit.<br />
<br />
What you think about this template?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

And with spell crafting, you might be able to lower those even more and save points, and just use better items.<br />
<br />
Get weapon 50.  Great damage variance.<br />
<br />
Left axe to 39 for styles.<br />
<br />
Balance into crit.  Higher the better.</div></div><hr />
