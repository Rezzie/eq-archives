<br />
From the North Wing, Dismembered Finger (pos330, pos200)<br />
<br />
From the West Wing, Dismembered Thumb (neg142, pos623)<br />
<br />
From the South Wing, Mutilated Forearm (neg570, pos150)<br />
<br />
From the East Wing, Blood Encrusted Glove; 4-slot container (pos310, neg570)<br />
<br />
Combine the finger, thumb, and forearm in the glove and receive Hand of Glory. Can be added to keyring. The items are ground spawns and seem to be on the same timer as the mobs.. whatever that is.</div></div><hr />

The only reason anyone goes to HS anymore is to kill Drusella for the urn.  This was recognized by SoE when they nerfed gflux to move you laterally rather than vertically.  So you either had to have a rogue to go kill this mob, or fight through 3 useless wings and hope that the keys dropped quickly (forgive me if I'm wrong and they always drop off the same mob...I always brought a rogue).  All that, and you have to do it again in 3 days when she doesn't drop the @#%$#$^ urn.<br />
<br />
Seems to me you'd be jumping for joy that your guildmates aren't dragging you off to HS every few days.  Of course, I'd probably still bring a rogue, cuz well, I already wasted enough time camping the first HS key.<br />
<br />
...and who doesn't have a rogue twink for just this kind of crap anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Khoren Stonefall</div><div class="date">08-27-03, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can still levitate into the east wing if you give it a bit of work (you don't need to flux), but the door to Drussel's place was always locked.  I am not sure what key you used to need to open it (maybe the coin depicting innoruuk?) because I just gave up when I got there and found I couldn't get through, but the hand of glory opens it now.<br />
<br />
Now, I had the same problem that Sirena did.  The Coin Depicting Innoruuk has been moved.  I had to check a few places in the south wing before I found it.  It's new loc is (-570, -75).  Instead of heading west out of the room with the pit trap in the south wing, head east.  Do not go in the doors.  Take the right you're forced to make, pass by the secret wall without going through, and at the end of that hall there's a little stub of a passage off to the west.  It's right there on the floor.<br />

<br />
Also a chanter friend who used to solo DS all the time said that Lev appears to drop faster, so you need Selos to get across (from the top of a torch on one of the wings) to the platform.<br />
<br />
Can then lull/DA there np, and her door isnt locked, unless you're talking about coming from the other direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of my pc's can use lev to get across to east wing, the other (slower) will not.  I have to log both out, log in 2nd char on first pc and then log both out again when I get there and log back in.  And Drusella is in front of the locked door (too bad she isnt behind it), I see necros solo her all the time, still looking for the urn myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sirena Silensia</div><div class="date">08-27-03, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Khoren, that was of course the only spot in South wing where I didn't look.   <br />
<br />
Some more info on HS now: <br />
- As mentioned before, you don't need to have the key object on your cursor to open doors. Having them in a backpack is sufficient.<br />
- the Hand of Glory (Master Key) goes on the Keyring.<br />
- Every mob sees through Sneak. Rather annoying for the exploring Monk. I don't know about Invis vs. Undead, I went in without potions.<br />
- Some named mobs can spawn anywhere in a wing, so basically any mob is a PH for a named now. The mobs who drop the key to the next wing still are on the same spot though. Edited by: Sirena Silensia at: 8/28/03 4:14 am</div></div><hr />

Rogues were never truly required anyway so not an earth-shattering change to get upset over.  Just a convenience for people who've spent some time there.</div></div><hr />

Huh?<br />

The locs have been in parenthesis in the first post since I read it earlier this morning.<br />

<br />
Of course, that's neither hither nor yon now, because I have the hand of glory and the door opens, but previously I had no such luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Khoren Stonefall</div><div class="date">08-27-03, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incidentally, the Charasis zone guide I used to do this quest is here: cloud.prohosting.com/~tal...arasis.htm<br />
<br />
It is all correct except for the location of the Coin Depicting Innoruuk which has been moved to the location I described in a post on the first page of this thread.<br />
<br />
That will give you the maps and information you need to crawl the zone from beginning to end, without any lockpicking required.  Just set aside 5 or 6 hours to do it, because the wing bosses with the keys for the next wing aren't always up &gt;_&amp;lt;.  (Well, The Crypt Keeper was up when I got there, but it took me seven cycles to get the Skeletal Procurator to spawn).<br />
<br />
Between that Zone guide, the locs in the first page of this thread, and my tip about the new location of the Coin, you do not need any other information to get your Hand of Glory.<br />

She spawns right in front of the locked door (just past the 4 golems), her spawn is incorrect on the map I use so thats probably why you are confused about it, you are proabably looking at the same map.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_gwindor n</div><div class="date">08-27-03, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can verify what people are saying about the relationship between lag and being able to lev into the east wing. On my main box I can do it every time, on my B box it took significant effort (and a bit of luck probably) to pull it off, and there is a huge lag difference between the two machines. When I tried logging my cleric onto my main box and running into East that way, it worked fine.<br />
If you can manage the levitation into the East wing there are no locked doors between you and drusella. The 4 guards are easily pacified / lulled (with regular pacify, my cleric did not have pacification at the time I killed her for my urn). The door that is locked behind Drusella is (I think, it has been a while) the exit or leads to the exit if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />

i had the candle and the amulet looking key on me.<br />
didnt need them on my pointer anymore and the door to the dismembered finger opened.<br />

might have been the candle key that opened the door then.they were the only 2 keys on me and we had no rogue with us.</div></div><hr />

Also tried the quest container on cursor, and tried with nothing on cursor. <br />
Well, I suspect it's because I'm on Kael Drakkal (german server). We're lagging behind patches sometimes. Got the revamped HS as far as I can see (shuffled named loot, drusella being static now, new drus loot (belt is nice)), but the doors seem to be left out.<br />
The dismembered bodyparts are just lore as I read somewhere. So I'll probably have my pocket rogue tag along next kill and collect the dismembereds for the my necro.</div></div><hr />
