What are the effects of doing the betrayal quest to get access to the evil side?  can i never go bad to qeynos? etc?</div></div><hr />

In order to enter the city, you must be a citizen.  Think you can sneak into FP a bit, but if the guards catch you, they throw you out.  Not sure on that.  Doing the first part of the betrayel quest revokes your citizenship in your starting city.  And you won't get citizenship in your new city until you complete the whole quest.  Basically, no bank for you, no merchants that pay nice prices, no brokerage to buy from or sell from, no inn, and if you run to the guards, well, they don't care.<br />
<br />
But once you complete the quest, you are in.  Can rent a room, get the same prices from merchants, and so on.  About the only things that are different is that my being Iksar makes some PCs stop and check me out and some NPCs make various racial comments.</div></div><hr />

You can still sell your items, but the prices aren't as good. Expect to pay out the arse when repairing your gear, assuming you can find a mendor outside the city. I think there might be one at the crossroads in Commonlands, but I'm not sure. I will say this: Expect the quest to take a while unless you have friends to help you. If it's anything like the FP &gt; Q quest, then there are some npcs you'll have to kill in some out of the way places. It took me about 3 days to finish mine up.<br />
<br />
Make certain you take all the items you want from your inn room, and relinquish it before you begin the quest. I had to run back into Big Bend and relinquish my room, because for some reason inn keepers in Qeynos and Freeport have many meetings. Where they share the names of those who run off without telling them. Nothing better than thinking you're done with the whole betrayal thing, then having to run back into the middle of the city you just betrayed.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, the guards'll never kill you. They really wussified them. If they catch you inside the city, all they do is teleport you outside.</div></div><hr />

Yah, there is.  A tall ugly woman --- think she's an ogre or a troll.  She didn't want my business, but yet still took my money.  :crazy  If you're good, she'll still mend your stuff, but will insult you the entire time.  It's actually kinda funny.<br />

I agree! I went to the CL for a mail quest and had to run through groups of guards.  Here I am, heart pounding, palms sweaty afraid I'm going to hear a shout ... then nothing! It was a good thing, but at the same time such a let-down.  I can remember from EQL how fun it was sneaking into and around Neriak (I was a half-elf).  For guards who profess to be all evil or all good, they sure don't hold true to their standards.   <br />
<br />
I think they should have it that the guards standing outside the city gates won't hassle you (that way people can finish betrayal quests).  Once you get INSIDE, however, is another story.  The guards should kick your ass instead of just teleport you out.</div></div><hr />
