It's so strangely addicting. It's kind of like Hikaru no Go, but with a evil twist to it. It's about Mahjong, and Akagi is truly evil, cheating bastard. And yet, you kind of root for him? It's weird.<br />

I'm up to episode 13 now.</div></div><hr />

I can barely play checkers! Haha. It does look like a cool game to play though! They keep hyping up some sort of &quot;death match&quot; that he's going to have one year later or something. So I'm kind of curioius about what's going to happen. I'm going to be free for 9 days 16 hours a day starting Friday as a favor to my parents, babysitting my little sister. So I decieded to keep the rest of it in stock to watch later.<br />

How far in are you? Does the arc after ep 13 end with what's currently released, 18? Or does it go further still? Would be nice to see the whole arc at once.</div></div><hr />
