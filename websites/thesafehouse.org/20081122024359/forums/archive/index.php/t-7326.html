<br />
I realize super jumping allows you to cross large distances, but if I also take super speed, you think I'll also be able to jump even further, or maybe jump the same distance, but faster?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe Swift and Hurdle both work with Super Jump, as does Quickness (a super reflexes power). I wouldn't be surprised if super jump and super speed don't work together, as they're both main travel powers.  Don't know for sure, but I don't feel like leveling a character to 16 just to try it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idiot Neutral</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm actually going this route (character's currently 13).  I'll let you know what I find out when I hit either 16 or 18.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to recall someone complaining that they didn't work together on the Beta Boards.<br />
<br />
Said they slowed down dramatically once they jumped, and sped back up as soon as they landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, you are much better off taking the Fitness line and enhancing the aspect of the power you need.<br />
<br />
Take Superspeed then , Hurdle in the fitness line.<br />
<br />
Take Super Jump and  Swift in the fitness line.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As all skills in the game, they get better when you level.  So at lvl 35 with hurdle you will be jumping over small  buildings, or the same with swift.<br />
<br />
You  will wont get the full benefit, but it is a nice to be able to improve on one of the skills.  Its a nice bonus if you are taking health or stamina anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Super Jump and Super Speed DO NOT WORK TOGETHER. You will get the speed of super jump while in the air, and the speed of super speed on the ground.<br />
<br />
Super Speed and Combat Jumping do because combat jumping doesn't have a speed component.<br />
Super speed and swift work, along with super speed and hurdle.</div></div><hr />
