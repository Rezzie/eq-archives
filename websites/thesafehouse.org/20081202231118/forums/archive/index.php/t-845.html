<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Doofy Rainbowfloatar</div><div class="date">03-07-04, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...So it's a sunday after noon. I've been here at work for 6 hours, and still got another 10 to go lol. I decide when I come in...&quot;hey, there's nothing to do...winmx has that neon genesis evangelion series going on, why not watch the whole thing&quot;<br />
<br />
Now...ok....maybe I'm missing something here...but WHAT THE *&amp;amp;$  IS GOING ON!?!?!?  <br />
<br />
SPOILERS BELOW<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand the whole robots, and the angels trying to reach adam and it's their job to protect the underground city and such...but after the gay dude hit on the main character in the shower room, then proceeded to demolish the whole city...asking for the main character to kill him...at which the main character squeezed him like a tube of toothpaste, and popped his head off....things got a little wierd.<br />
<br />
random one liners from basically every person in the entire movie *including the penguin who can't talk*...scene's of various people dead....yet talking. the three main girl characters nakid floating towards the screen...blood guts and gore...people crying, every type of animation style known to man, and so many flash backs and cuts to scene's I had an epileptic seasure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me....What the hell happened through the last 3 episodes? The kid establishes the fact that he doesn't hate himself, and all of a sudden everyone's clapping...even those people that were dead before the anime even started. then it ends!!! <br />
<br />
if anyone can make heads or tails out of this series, please feel free to post below  <br />
