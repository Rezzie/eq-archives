I just picked this up last night.  It starts in the Ravenholdt stronghold out in Hillsbrad Foothills.  You are sent to retrieve an Azure Bag from a Timbermaw Shaman in Azshara.  The shaman is located just outstide Timbermaw Hold.  There are two ways to obtain the bag; brute force and subtlety.  Being a rogue, I chose the subtle route.  Be sure that you declare that you are At War with the Timbermaw if you have built to non-KoS faction with them.  This will allow you to pickpocket the Shaman and (hopefully) obtain the Azure Bag.  If you come up empty, you are likely to need to kill him in order to reset his pockets.  I was fortunate and obtained it on my first pick.<br />
<br />
You are instructed to take the bag to the Archmage in the Tower of Azshara.  Speak with the NPC that will teleport you up to the Tower area and head to the top of the tower.  The Archmage does not know how to open the bag yet, but knows that some Oozes (Forest Oozes to be specific) in the NE portion of Azshara have destroyed it and hee needs 10 encoded fragments from these Oozes in order to obtain the information needed to open the bag.  There appear to be someplace between 4-6 Forest Ooze spawns over the entire Bitter Reach area of Azshara and this is the portion of the quest that I am on currently.  I have landed 5 of the fragments after roughly 2 hours of running around, though I suspect other rogues out there were responsible for long jags never seeing any Oozes.  The drop rate appears to be roughly 50% or so.<br />
<br />
I will elaborate further as I work through the quest.  You could probably also check out wow.allakhazam.com or www.thottbot.com for more complete quest information, but I like using these resources to research item rewards and try to follow the quest trails in-game rather than read all the details before doing it myself.</div></div><hr />
