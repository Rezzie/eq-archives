<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gamble</div><div class="date">04-21-05, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am on Eonar server, its a PvE server and with this new patch my guild raided crossroads.  That was my first PvP action besides a few duels.  I had a ball.  What really hurt me was Fear but I knew that was going to happen based on all the forums I read.  But also those area effect fire spells are a pain. <br />
<br />
What I was wondering if resist gear is worth getting.  I was going to start with the +5 to all resits to my cloak.  Maybe pick up a ring or 2 just to use during raids like this.<br />
<br />
I figured you pvp server people would know better if this is a waste of gold or not.<br />

Thus any resist gear you get, adds greatly to how you react to spells.  I once had about 40 or so nature resist on my 55 rogue and resisted roots fairly often and broke out of them fairly quickly.  I'd say getting resist gear is and knowing when to use it is a very good thing, but do aim for at least 30 to get some results.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulthien</div><div class="date">05-06-05, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">..and i was fancing the idea to collect resist gear and go into PvP.<br />
<br />
So far i invested into thorium armor pieces, and have together with a 1H sword like: 7+5+6+8 = total 26 resist on all. This is utterly negligable, prolly under 10% resist on spells.<br />
<br />
Add paladin fire resist of ca 40 atop, and i still resist only maybe 30% fire damage in PvP.<br />
<br />
bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slymm</div><div class="date">05-09-05, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you should be looking at around 60-80 unbuffed FR for MC raids and stuff like that (hopefully you'll have GoW/shm totem etc to boost you up past 100) which will still be about a poor to average rating.<br />
<br />
for pvp, i think the stats that you get from normal gear are for the most part far more important. but i dont pvp a lot, so maybe im wrong on that part.<br />
<br />
definitely start looking for FR pieces for raiding though, if your guild is planning to do onyxia and MC.</div></div><hr />

Yeah figured it out hard way after first few charges yesterday :pulid<br />
<br />
the several hundred hp more &gt; 30 resist.<br />
<br />
Also, i think i found out the TRUE ROLE of pally in PvP raid skirmishes:<br />
<br />
We are the frontline chargers.<br />
<br />
When both sides stand in lines facing each others (and you can hear gorilla-like uh-uh-uh of taunts crossing over the battlefield as attempt to get the other side charge in and die), the paladins shine forth.<br />
<br />
I charge in, get all the enemy fire (have to be fire protected to not die on the spot though :pulid) and when on 20% or less life, fire divine shield, then clense-clense-clense and heal, while retreating (backwards, to hit eventual charging warrior with hammer).<br />
<br />
Benefit is twofold: While (a) you attracted all the enemy firepower, you (b) also entice your own side players to charge in after you. As the enemy attention is on you as first charger, they are oft too late to engage others, and you have broken their ranks.<br />
<br />
The side that retreats, like in real war, has most casualties thereafter..<br />
<br />
Of course, the paladin will die in ca 1 of 3 such charges, but you also helped establish your image as a local hero, which might be worth it too - in the hearts of the Ladies... <br />
(the contribution points we cant earn anyhows :pulid)</div></div><hr />
