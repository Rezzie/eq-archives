<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lazarus</div><div class="date">04-17-02, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 23 SB, just started playing RvR in BG and having a difficult time at it.  I know it's a very different game, and I will have to significantly change my playing style.  But have a few questions.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, just a rant: why oh why do they only allow 8 slots per quickbar???!!! With all the styles, weapons, stealth, run, etc, I have 3 bars stacked and not even half of my styles yet.  Has anyone ever seen a rationale posted (other than it's a power of 2 which would be just about the dumbest reason I could think of)?<br />
2h vs. Shield and 1h: I have a sweet 1h sword that was given to me (oj at 23), my 2h is from Kmart (slower, less damage actually, no magic).  Can you block with 2h?  I think I've seen it in battle, but not quite sure.  I'm sorely tempted to stick with sh/1h, but not sure.  (And switching is always nice, except that it takes up a quickbar slot.)<br />
Selecting shield: I am loathe to give up a quick-bar slot to put my shield in.  If I use my quickbar to switch from 2h to 1h, the shield doesn't get equipped (as if I'm likely to want to wave to a mob).  Does anyone know if this will ever be changed (i.e. fixed).  I usually keep my inv panel open during battle.  I would like to simply click on it to equip.  Problem is, I have to double left-click, then right click TWICE to get the stupid thing selected.  Is there a faster way here?<br />
Movement rate in Stealth: Any idea how/when movement rate increases as you raise stealth?  Is it linear, or does it pop at some point.<br />
Throwing daggers: does the quality of a dagger increase range, to hit prob, or just damage?  All I really want it for is pulling mobs in PvE.  Also, in RvR, could daggers (at appropriate envenom levels) actually be used to take out (or at least &quot;adjust the attitude of&quot;) keep-holders from behind the ramparts?  Has anyone ever done this effectively?<br />
Also, dagger related: if you env a dagger, does it env the whole set equipped or just the one you're about to throw?  (I know I could just screw around with it, but figured I'd ask here so other n00bs like me would see the answer.)<br />
/Stick and /Face: It's pretty clear at this point I'm going to have to give up a slot on all my quickbars for a /stick macro.  Apart from the glaringly obvious, does anyone have specific tactics/advice on using it in RvR?  How about /face, is it really worth the slot?<br />
Style vs. normal combat: On the average how often do you use style attacks in RvR?   I expect ALWAYS for an opener.  But I'm stuck between the benefit of taking an enemy down as quickly as possible to avoid being hit, and the possiblity of another guy showing up when I'm ooe.  Just looking a rule-of-thumb from the experienced here.  I understand it is highly situational.<br />
Lower level styles: Does using a low-level style like Assault ever become not worthwhile?  As you lvl, do they become more damaging and effective, taking the penalties and situations into account?<br />
And lastly, kbd layout: I know this is a highly personal issue, but my biggest prob in RvR is moving, targeting, styling, and changing qbs fast enough and not ending up getting my fingers twisted.  I have EDSF for movement, Shift-num for QB select, R for cycle enemies, A for attack (with num for style of course).  This keeps my middle finger pretty busy (apart from when I see the enemy mowing my mates down... 8) .<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions, pointers, etc, would be much appreciated.  I just discovered this BBS and I've learned alot here so far.  Thanks in advance for any feedback.<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bargle13</div><div class="date">04-18-02, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Its a limitation of the engine in the games design, it was stated that this was looked at to be changed and decided up that it would be impossible to fix without major system rewrites. Sadly 8 slots is all youll ever see.<br />
<br />
2. 2h vs. 1h/shield... Well lemme say I use both! Yep thats right I put my 2h in the 2h slot, and shield/sword in my regular. I open usually with my 2h envenomed, then cilck a button in my quick bar to switch to my 1h/shield combo. I didnt need to do anything special to get the shield to acivate. Just make sure its active when you make the quickbar button and it SHOULD work.. Does for me, I was having the same problems with the shield as you were, now I dont have any. BTW I love the shield and may never dual wield. That being said it's saved me a time or two in the 24 BG.<br />
<br />
3. See my answer above.. Nuff said.<br />
<br />
4. Movement rate vs. stealth, I cant tell you if its linear, but it is noticeable, and from what I understand you get up to your walking speed (or maybe slightly faster) with higher specs. The key here is you just have to be fast enough to get close to your target, once your close your stealth needs to allow you from being seen. From that point it's moot. You can move as slow as molassas for all I care as long as I can get close. I have however seen highly spec'd SB's in the BG that move at about 2x my speed, having about 2x my spec in stealth..<br />
<br />
5. Range on daggers is totally related to the types you buy, there have been new daggers released in the latest patch with different ranges.. I would recommend checking the patch notes for these kinds of daggers, and their ranges.<br />
<br />
6. Daggers cant be envenomed.. You can place poison on them, but it does nothing. Dont wast the poison, hopefully this will be fixed/changed later.<br />
<br />
7. Gonna pass this one for a quickbar discussion at the end..<br />
<br />
8., and 9. This is entirely based upon the type of spec you have. I am a Envenom/Crit spec'd SB. I rely on a hard crit, plus poison to do in a target. I usually only attack two or three times on a target before I flee. I may hit a few more times if he doesnt have friends, etc. Its entirely based upon your player spec, and playstyle on what you precieve is best. Personally I dont use ANY sword styles in combat, I only use CS styles even though they hare huge end drains. That will probably change as I get a higher main wepon spec and get some better sword styles, but in the 24 BG I can get away with CS styles exclusively. Combats for me are usually happen a few ways with my stealth so low. Assasin comes in close, and attacks, I return favor and proc DoT switch wepon, hit again with my second blade/poison, and then see if I can get another poke or two before he runs. A group/caster walks by and I try to setup a PA (the caster almost always sees me and walks backwards I am still suprised at this, I'd personally turn tail and run) I PA, proc poison and run, they usually dont live. Or I see a sniper destealth I destealth and run to them, I Hit em with garotte proc first poison, switch weapons proc second, and just peck away. My tactics in the 24 BG have so far served me quite well.<br />
<br />
10. Keboard Layout, here again is a personal preference, I have mine setup similar to the WASD layout I use for my FPS games, find what feels right and use it. Dont be afraid to reassign keys, if you have to reach across the keyboard, or look up from the action, then that key/action is in the wrong place.<br />
<br />
Finally In regards to the styles/quickbar layouts, I dont know how other Stealthers are but I use a layout that works for me quite well and am more than willing to share. Slots 1 and 2 on all my quick bars are the same, 1 is always sprint, and 2 is always stealth, you need to have these easy to access, and by having them in the same spots on all the quick bars it saves fumbling for the right bar/slot. I put the main wep styles I use with /stick and or /face in bar one, its the easiest to switch to/from and since I sue main wep styles for mostly PvE it works out well besides allowing me to /stick a target before I hotkey to my BS/PA groups. Bar 2 is my Backstab 1 Chain with Garotte, Pincer and Hamstring, Bar 3 is Backstab 2 Chain with Garotte, Pincer and Hamstring. Bar 4 (the one I use most PvP) is PA, Garotte, Hamstring, 2 Hander, 1 Hander/Shield. I find it difficult to use hamstring with any kind of frequency, but I have it here in case I manage to get the opportunity.<br />
<br />
The key things I try to keep in mine for my QB's are, if you plan on using certain styles often place them on multiple bars, and try to use the same spot which keeps you from fumbling. Only place buttons on your QB's that you USE, some people feel the need to have every style/spell available, you only NEED maybe 4 QB's worth of stuff, even my 41 RM only uses 4 bars, and I simply replace the older spells with the newer ones. Finally keep it simple, I actually feel my QB right now is a bit cluttered so I'll probably address that in a lvl or two when I get my new CS styles, only put on the bar what you need, and will use drop all the dead weight.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you, sorry for the EXTENSIVE reply, just making sure I address your questions/concerns.<br />
<br />
Kudos<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Veloci</div><div class="date">04-18-02, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bargle is right on with his reply.  I do a few things different.<br />
I use the default keyboard layout and it serves me fine, I guess you can get used to anything.<br />
<br />
My QB's are all laid out with slot 7 stealth and spot 8 sprint.<br />
I have 4 bars in use and all are the same<br />
<br />
bar 1- 2 weapon melee... 2 weapon icons and 3 styles<br />
bar 2- 2h weapon and melee styles<br />
bar 3- all crits starting with BSII/thighcut in slots 1/2 for<br />
          targets that do not require a PA<br />
bar 4- again all crits starting at slot 1 with PA Veloci Raptor <br />
Shadowblade<br />
Clan Wolverine<br />
Morgan La Fay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lazarus</div><div class="date">04-18-02, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Bargle and Veloci for the responses.  I just tried getting the 1h+Shield select to work again and it still doesn't work.  Made sure both 1h+Sh were selected before dragging to the quickbar, but it still doesn't work.  Even tried using ths sheild as the quick bar icon, but all it does is select the shield, no 1h, so same problem there.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
As far as the 8 versus 10 quickbar slots goes, it is *inconceivable* to me that this would take more than an hour to change.  I can't even imagine how you could write  dispatch code that would make it this difficult even if you tried.  I'll pay $100 to anyone who can justify it to my satisfaction.  (Anyway, I promise I'll never bitch about it again, but it just steams me to see stuff like this.)<br />
<br />
I did rework my quickbar, and it looks like it's going to work well now.  Thanks alot for the great feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">04-18-02, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 8 vs. 10 quickbar issue is a problem in the game engine which is leased by mythic.  They did not create the game engine, so they cannot change this without a change being made to the game engine itself.<br />
<br />
The earliest you could see a change made to this would be when the expansion comes out with the upgraded game engine.</div></div><hr />
