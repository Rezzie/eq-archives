<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vestas</div><div class="date">11-11-04, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought I'd get a thread started on fighting techniques, this will apply a lot to Scouts as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
From levels 1-7 don't sweat it.  You're basically a slightly more damaging fighter.  Once you starting getting an array of abilities things get different.  At level 8 if I recall you should be suitably &quot;skilled&quot; with the following abilities:<br />
<br />
Cheap Shot<br />
Sneak Attack<br />
Evade<br />
Ambush<br />
Dirty Tricks<br />
Quick Strike<br />
<br />
Additionally you can dual wield! Don't forget this!  Dual wielding makes a big difference in consistent damage output.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tactic 1: - The Heroic Opportunity<br />
<br />
Your most powerful combo is &quot;Ringing Blow&quot;.  Trigger your HO skill then you can follow it up with Dirty Tricks or Evade.  I recommend Dirty Tricks, especially solo, as it is a mob debuff and recycles faster than Evade does.  Your final move is Quick Strike.  This most of the time will pummel the mob quite hard.  Learning to set your hotkeys up to fire off this combo quickly can allow you to take on orange con solo mobs without much difficulty.   Occaisionally this will trigger a 3 minute attack/def buff on you as well, which is a nice bonus.<br />
<br />
Tactic 2: - The sneak attack strike<br />
<br />
It is essential to practice move solo.  You'll have noticed that Sneak Attack is a positional attack, can only be done from the flank or rear.  So you can't use it solo right?  WRONG!  Your &quot;Cheap Shot&quot; ability stuns your opponent.  Careful timing can allow you to trigger a &quot;Cheap Shot&quot; and quickly sidestep to the side of the mob and smack him from a Sneak Attack.  I recommend shutting off auto-attack after triggering Cheap Shot, as if you swing and hit between the landing of Cheap Shot and your Sneak Attack, you'll unstun the mob and lose your position.  <br />
<br />
NOTE: Rogues this is doable for backstab as well, just takes a bit more time.  It is worth the time and effort to practice this move.  If you're unsure, start on low con mobs.<br />
<br />
Tactic 3: - Ambush<br />
<br />
This one is cake.  Stealth yourself then approach the mob, trigger ambush and watch the damage roll in.  It is BETTER to use Ambush then sneak attack or backstab for this approach. Ambush is significantly more power and frankly the best &quot;opening&quot; move we have for solo combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, with the above in mind my usual approach is to open with an Ambush (assuming i Have the time to stealth, otherwise I'll use sneak/backstab).  I'll then immediately followup with a Ringing Blow (Tactic 1) using DIrty Tricks to get the debuff on.  Followed quickly by a sneak attack or backstab strike.  By the time the backstab move is completed you should be ready to lay the smack down with another Ringing Blow.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat as necessary.  In the early levels this combination really allows you to drop mobs quickly and efficiently.  I make no promises about later soloability, but at level 8 I was taking orange cons and only losing about a bub of health.  Yellow/whites took less health then that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-11-04, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've also noticed that when you get the buff (Swindler's Luck I believe it's called) you do not get a damage bonus to your attack.  Yesterday evening I was killed because everytime I initiated a HO I ended up getting the damn 'Swindler's Luck' buff instead of the 'Ringing Blow'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bippinfv</div><div class="date">11-11-04, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you notice you get &quot;Swindler's luck&quot; but want &quot;Ringing Blow&quot;. trigger a 'coin' ability (cheap shot, dirty tricks, evade) to change the effect. The change is random, so you could get another &quot;Swindler's luck&quot; but at least you get another chance.</div></div><hr />

If it's not now then you should be /bugging it.  I seem to remember roughly 10% more damage off special attacks when I was playing.</div></div><hr />
