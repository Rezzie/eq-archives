<br />
I'm interested in playing on one of the teams servers, and would like some advice on where to start out.  First, I'm wondering which of the two servers people prefer.  I have a 52 monk on Morell-Thule, and have really come to like the population there.<br />
<br />
Second, what race would people recommend?  I'd like to play a rogue, or maybe an Erudite Shadowknight, and I'd like to do a bit of player killing.  Are the light races allied or enemies on these servers?  Or would it be better to be a dark elf?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

It is a very hard life though as it is a Free for all server and you can loose a item plus all you coin.We have a 4 level difference.<br />
   If you want to play a Rogue/Good stats/Role play and Pk for good reasons I here the Shanks on Vallon are though very high of they are all Barbarian. Although being a Barb you have to forsake bathing for a month to get that proper Barb musk( he he Joke guys/gals) On Vallon you only loose coin , but it is a 8 level difference. I have played on Tallon a week so I really cant give a opinion of there. Even People that they have killed have the utmost respect for them. But as I am in the OBR<br />

It is indeed tougher at the newbie levels.  However, Vallon and Tallon have teams that conflict withe the environment and will eventually get you involved in the nasty political struggle between purists and cross teamers.<br />
<br />
I'm really looking forward to some new games coming out.<br />
