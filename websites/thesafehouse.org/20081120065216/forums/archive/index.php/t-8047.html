I'm sure it wouldn't be to difficult to find out myself.  However I am just wondering what others have to say.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

Head to Warsliks Wood or Lake Omen and kill as many Gobbos as you can.  If you are high enough, sit at the Gobbo camp in WW and camp Grachnist.  When your faction is maxed like mine, you will con indifferent to about 99% of Firiona Vie.  Once you don a light race illusion, you will con warmly.  Be warned on the docks near the Soul Binder, there are some barbarians that are not on the FV faction, and are still scowling without the illusion.  If you REALLY want to do it, that's the way I did it.  Also, if you get your faction high enough with an illusion, you can turn in Drolvarg Fangs to help speed up the positive faction hits.  Good luck!<br />

<br />
(I have two accounts so this may not apply to you)<br />
<br />
I leveled a druid up to the point where she could port to lavastorm and I bound her right next to the poison merchant in FV.  Filled her up with +cha gear and 10 slot backpacks and memorized &quot;Gate&quot; and &quot;Ring of Lavastorm&quot;.<br />
<br />
I hauled my Dark-Elf butt to lava with all the empty backpacks and money I could muster and sat at the port in.<br />
<br />
Then I just sat for hours, mind numbingly making poison.  When I needed to sell off the X bags of poison, I dumped it on the druid and gated back to FV to sell them and get more supplies.  The vendor in FV seem to pay a bit more than the LS druid chick.<br />
<br />
Wash, Rinse, Repeat as necessary. (or until you go broke)<br />
<br />
With PoP, that's no longer needed, but not eveyone has PoP.  Just offering that up as an alternative.</div></div><hr />

I was there working my skill earlier in erudite form, and sitting right next to me was another dark elf rogue in half elf form    I think someone else posted this, but just wanted to confirm it as an option for those DE rogues who don't have PoP.  <br />
