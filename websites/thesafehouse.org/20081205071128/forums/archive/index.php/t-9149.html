<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-19-04, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering how effective thsoe leadership powers are, and whether it might be worth it to look into taking them.<br />
<br />
I'm an empath Defender, so I have to be a little bit more concious of endurance drains than others, but soon i will have Recovery Aura, so I could at least use those sort of powers when RA is up during big fights without much fear of running low on end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Didnt notice a lot of difference... but I hear really good things about the defense aura.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-19-04, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard they work, and I think they might even stack.  Official forums might have a better answer, but stuff disappears if you blink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-19-04, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telurinon</div><div class="date">05-19-04, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maneuvers version adds 6.25% Defense to all members of the group in range.  Fully slotted with SO's, this can go as high as 13.75%.  This stacks with other buffs as well.<br />
<br />
If a group of 8 all have Maneuvers, with no enhancers, that is 50% Defense.  Minions that con even have a 50% base chance to hit, Lt's have a base 75% chance to hit.  Thus, minions would be dropped to minimal (5%) chance to hit and Lts would be reduced to only 25% chance -- and potentially much more if the power is enhanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-19-04, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defense modifies chance to hit as % of their base, not directly.  so a 10% defense bonus is 50% chance to hit - 10% of the 50%, ie 45% not 40%.<br />
<br />
50% defense would be a 25% hit chance for even con minion, not a 0% hit chance.  for Lts. 50% defense would be a 37.5% hit chance not a 25% hit chance.  <br />
<br />
Also there are some claims that stacking is applied progressively.  If this is true, then 5 10% buffs wouldn't really be 50% reduction.  They would be roughly 41% reduction.  This last bit is purely speculation with nothing from the devs either way as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DizzyKid</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Defender, I have both Manuevers and Tactics and I have both abilities SO sloted (1 slot right now) and I already notice a difference, but mainly from Tactics. I honestly don't think we could kill the stuff we do, efficiently, without having 1-2 Tactics on, since the rest of my group is lvl 25ish and we're killing lvl 35-37 mobs. Manuevers is nice, but isn't really noticeable vs the COT mobs we've been killing, unless we were stacking like 4 of them.<br />
<br />
As far as the mana &quot;problem&quot;, I don't really have one. With Hasten and SO slots almost to the max on both auras and hasten, I've gotten the timer down to a few minutes between uses and a 30sec reuse time on Hasten after it fades. When I finishing slotting my auras, I really wouldn't be surprised if it's down to 30sec-1 minute also (after buff fades).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plase keep in mind it depends on what type of class you are how much the pool power affects you.<br />
<br />
Geko stated these numbers<br />
<br />
Buffing<br />
Defender 12.5% (was either the damage buff or the defense buff)<br />
Controller 10%<br />
Other 7%<br />
<br />
So a defender taking that power pool will get more of a benefit.  I am sure this is probably also the same if a Controller took like boxing.  His would be weaker then if say a Scrapper took it.<br />
<br />
Just something to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow.. Any link to those percentages? First I've ever heard about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those numbers are real. I read them on the official CoH forums earlier today. In the powers board. Defenders get bonuses to all 'buffing' type power pool powers.<br />
<br />
But it works the other way too, according to Geko. Scrappers do more damage with Power Pool attacks than a defender would, Tankers get more benefit from defensive, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darn... I was thinking about doing a Melee defender build using thsoe powers. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm definately glad I saw those numbers before I took any of those powers. I'd really avoid the leadership pool if you were a scrapper or tanker. <br />
<br />
Does kind of fight with how leadership works in the comics. Captain America is the go to guy for leadership in the Avengers, not the Scarlet Witch. :)</div></div><hr />
