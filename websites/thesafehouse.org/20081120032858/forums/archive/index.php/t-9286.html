<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">05-23-04, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, where can I find a trainer for herbology and alchemy in or about the Ironforge region?<br />
<br />
Second, has anyone progressed very far in cooking?  I learned fishing, but it's something of a PITA, and the fish I can catch so far aren't ones I have learned how to cook, so it's kinda disappointing.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  Should I bag fishing?  Should I pick up tailoring or something so I can have more than 1 backpack without paying through the nose? ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can train alchemy in the Gnome section, on the right after you go down the elevator.<br />
<br />
I'm at 75 in cooking and probably won't go beyond that, since I find alchemy much more helpful on a daily basis. However, having to restock on herbs every other day is a PITA.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't pick up too many trades as skill points do get a bit hard to come by later on...no, nevermind that. What I should say is to try out wahtever you want, but once you take one or two into Journeyman (75 SPs for alchemy alone), you'll probably be unlearning other tradeskills. <br />
<br />
RIght now (I'm 24) I've got journeyman herbalism and alchemy, and apprentice cooking. Maybe later on when I have extra SPs (somehow) I'll take on more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-23-04, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are I think two elevators; look for a giant metal door that periodically opens.<br />
<br />
I find the best way to remember where things are is to treat Ironforge like a clock.  The leathershop is I think around 4 or 5 o'clock, the rogue trainer is around 1 or 2 o'clock (Forlorn Cavern or something), the Gryphon Ride is I think around 2 o'clock (though I usually run around the outer edge until I find it).<br />
<br />
I'm only level 12 but I've been doing mining, blacksmithing, leatherworking, skinning, and first aid (though I think leatherwork and possibly first aid would be the only ones I might take above 75).  I've just been trying out everything I can to get a feel for it.</div></div><hr />

Walk... the walk with the Vault (bank) at it.  One elevator leads to the gnome area, the other to the High Seat.</div></div><hr />
