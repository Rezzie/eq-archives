<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Turlo</div><div class="date">05-18-02, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little background.  Our adventuring party is the remains from a military force that was sent to investigate a temple.  We were attacked by a dragon, and all of the troops were killed.  Now, me...the lovable undercover military police...aka rogue...is stuck in the middle of the situation.<br />
<br />
During our struggle to find food, shelter (a big storm hit us hard), and to just survive...we befriended a group of refugee orcs (not evil on this world) and attacked a dragon.  Due to the lack of food, the orcs informed us that trolls make good eating.  Usually, you cook it first, but if you eat it raw, you &quot;absorb its power, and become a true warrior!&quot;<br />
<br />
To make a good impression on our orc allies, we all ate some (well, except for the annoying elf wizard, and...um...she ended up being the only intelligent one!).  The results are...interesting.  Those who survived a fortitude check gained max hps for their next level on the roll.  However, the unlucky thief missed his by one point.  Along with several other allies, we now have a small troll growing in our stomachs.  It is too late to induce vomiting.<br />

Next game session is in a week.  Any ideas on what to do?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">05-19-02, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Point out to the GM that Acid attacks are, like fire attacks, something that trolls dont regenerate from. I think.  But that probably wont work because he'd have to reverse himself. <br />
<br />
An alternative would be to try a Cure Disease.  I think that works on parasites, and maybe the itty bitty tummy troll would count as such.<br />
<br />
Another alternative would be a rather messy bit of medieval surgery. I'd only try this if you had a cleric with a lot of healing spells handy, and definitely use a leech or midwife who's performed or assisted in a caesarean before.<br />
<br />
If you're more into the silly, you could try shrinking someone down and swallowing them... Then they duke it out with the troll in your stomach, defeat it, and cut it up into small enough parts to pass back up your esophagus.  You'd need a good shrink potion or spell though.<br />
<br />
Hmm... what else.... I'll think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Acobar</div><div class="date">05-19-02, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow.  That's pretty creative about shrinking.  <br />
<br />
Make sure you have some water-breathing and free-action</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Turlo</div><div class="date">05-19-02, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ROFL...I love the shrinking idea.  Mmm....here ranger, ranger, ranger.  The explination about the stomach acid is that some people have stronger stomach acid then others, and right now, the troll is regenerating a little faster then then the acid is dissolving it.<br />
<br />
This GM does a LOT of things different from the books.  Shoot, all the spells are different.  but, so far, I am having a blast.</div></div><hr />

Thats a big reason I like variant/house rules.  It keeps some mystery in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could try eating lots and lots of prunes. heh I work at an emergency medical facillity, and you'd be surprised at the dimensions of foregin bodies that the doctors will simply &quot;let pass.&quot; Just because an object is too big to come back up, doesn't mean it's too big to come out the other end.</div></div><hr />
