Mythic has stated you must be 50% weapon trained to be &quot;effective&quot; as an Assassin. <br />
<br />
Most rogues will tell ya 66%, 75%, 80% <br />
<br />
Your damageoutput will hurt on each and every fight without it. <br />
<br />
Think of it this way; CS affects Critical Strike Moves, <br />
Weapon Training affects EVERYTHING, CS, Pierce/Thrust/Slash, Offhand, Everything. <br />
<br />
Untrained Variance 25%-100%; average 66%<br />
50% Trained Variance 50%-125% average 88%<br />
75% Trained Variance 75%-125% average 100%<br />
100% Trained Variance 100%-150% average 125%<br />
<br />
So being specced in weapon basically DOUBLES your damage over being untrained in weapon. You will be crippled if you ignore this. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">05-13-02, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">weapon spec is the most important spec you will ever use. It determines your base damage EVERY time you swing. <br />
<br />
All assassins have plenty of spec points to have a high weapon spec. I reccomend at least 80% your level. I'm thinking of going for a natural 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">05-13-02, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed a large difference in the damage I've done in the last three levels.  During this time I have increased my thrust from a base of 40 with +5bonus to 47 with +13 bonus.  Effectively going from 45thrust to 60thrust.  I have also increased my strength quite a bt which also improves my weaponskill.  Making these changes I have seen my average damage nearly double.<br />
<br />
With assassins having a lower weaponskill bonus than tank types we end up doing less damage.  Anything you can do to improve your weaponskill will improve your damage output all around.</div></div><hr />

not quite true, but close.<br />
<br />
min. damage is calculated by:<br />
(((spec/level)*.75)+.25)*100%<br />
<br />
so 1/2 spec would have ((.5*.75)+.25)*100% = 62% MIN<br />
3/4 spec: ((.75*.75)+.25)*100%= 81% MIN<br />
full spec: ((1*.75)+.25)*100% = 100%<br />
<br />
MAX damage is the greater of 125% or<br />
(((spec/level)*.75)+.75)*100% <br />
Spec above 2/3 will increase your max damage.</div></div><hr />
