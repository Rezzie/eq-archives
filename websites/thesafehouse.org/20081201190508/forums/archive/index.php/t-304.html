<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tadyen Swifthand</div><div class="date">03-09-00, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I ran into my former GM, who didn't recgonize me. He asked me about my parrying dagger. I informed him the stats. He then offered to trade me a Crysknife for it. I accepted of course. When he tried to put it in his ranged slot he realized it wouldn't work. He asked to trade back but by now I was invisible already. I had asked him to sell his dirk earlier but he refused. This angered me, because he was a twinked out bard. So a few moments later I( see someoen selling a dragoon dirk. I end up trading the Crysknife and 60pp for my new wonderfull Dragoon Dirk.<br />
Muhahahahahaha<br />

Former GM as in he no longer is one? Otherwise I am not sure if I'd do it... PC's ok, no problem (for me that is) but GM's mmmh<br />

&quot;Guys, this suxxors, you must all leave the rogue class NOW! You don't like that enchanters or rangers get, then make a enc/rang twink. Stop playing your rogue!<br />
Then I can again be THE rogue on the raid like I used to be and not rogue_alt06 like I am now.&quot;   - Patofnaud</div></div><hr />
