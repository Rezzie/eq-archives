<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">10-10-03, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today in less than an hour I'm arguing my first appeal before the California court of appeals.  Three judges, as opposed to the normal one judge.  I have small speech prepared.  No attorneys to back me up.  It's a big task for a fourth year attorney.  Outside of getting some help for the reply brief writing, this case has been basically a solo effort.  I do not know what the other side is going to say, if anything.  <br />
<br />
Because of nerves, my hands have been freezing all morning and my head has been warm.  Ugh... Where's the emoticon for throwing up.  They don't tell you in law school the kinds of feelings you go through before your first hearing, your first trial, and then your first appeal, but I guess the bar exam is a good primer.  Anyway, there I go</div></div><hr />

Just remember that it is your position that is on trial, not your personality. State your case succintly, and you've done all you can do.  &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">10-10-03, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The result wasn't bad, though I don't think I did my best work.  I had to wait two hours with other people giving arguments before we argued.  I was calm at the bench but nervous speaking.  They didn't say anything unexpected, and I forgot one of my points, but I still think we should win.  I have a huge stomach ache now.  <br />
<br />
The thing with litigation is the pressure is not the fear of public speaking, but the pressure not to let down your client who relies on you as their advocate.  In the court of appeals level it's worse because you know that the decision may affect not only your client but others in their position in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">10-10-03, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Relax and have a beer.  This is like a college exam, there's nothing you can do now so no reason worrying about it.  Think about this, assuming you were honest, your client knows your abilities.  If they trust you, then they think you are qualified.  If they are willing to let you do the work, and you do your best, you are living up to your client.  Anyway, I GL on winning.  I know the stress. --------------------------<br />

I can only imagine how terrifying it must be. All good people scrutenize themselves harshly when others' lives are directly dependant upon their actions. Especially when working in unknown territory.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Northerner</div><div class="date">10-11-03, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done a ton of presentations, oral technical defenses and similar public speaking.  No, it isn't speaking in front of Judges but peer reveiws and presenting technical stuff to either tech or non-tech people is still stressful at times.<br />
<br />
To be quite honest, I still get butterflies.  Just keep in mind, no one I have presented for seems to notice.  *You* may feel nervous but that doesn't necessarily translate into your delivery.  That and normally I feel just fine about two minutes into the thing.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you are prepared and psych yourself up a bit.  There is no magic trick to public speaking and many of the best speakers ever all said they were nervous as hell before even a simple engagement. Celeris Tujimson<br />
