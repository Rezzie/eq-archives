<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">02-10-05, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're somewhat in luck... Conquest posted their raid strategies for Molten Core on their site at http://conquest.teamgbu.com/strats/moltencore/why.php <br />
<br />
Be warned though they WERE suspended for supposed exploits, but supposedly what they posted is proof that what they do isn't exploiting... but I make no claims! ;D  You decide what to use and what not to...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">02-10-05, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't Conquest get disbanded in EQ for exploiting in Sleeper's Tomb? I seem to remember some drama about that a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Good rule of thumb.. if you think it might be an exploit, it probably is ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bengel Tyger</div><div class="date">02-10-05, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea same guild that was banned in EQ.  It's funny when my guild first heard about their Onyixa kill, first thing we all though was they were gunna get banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biral</div><div class="date">02-10-05, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes they did get disbanded in Sleepers Tomb, however i heard about what they did to get some members suspended- its iffy to call it an exploit, and regardless the strats are solid enough (even they are smart enough not to post exploits on public forum).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">02-10-05, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah if what they say about what they were actually doing is true I'd think it's iffy to call it an exploit too.  Sounded more like smart thinking to me, and tactics that were common place in umm.. other games.<br />
<br />
But then again that's speaking from the limited viewpoint of a person who has never been to MC. ;)</div></div><hr />
