In Waggoner's gude it hints he can be triggered to spawn, but tonight's experience disproves this.  I know -belatedly- that someone used him to spawn Renux about 4 hours before the raid.  Is he on a timer? perhaps 8 or 12?</div></div><hr />

I know people say you can trigger it but I have never seen that work even though I know someone that tried. If hes not up I would suggest waiting a day and coming back.</div></div><hr />

First time took 5 minutes to find him, second time took 30 minutes.  We didnt have a tracker either time.  Either he is usually up or we were just extremely lucky.</div></div><hr />

He was up but someone was using him to get Renux. After they finished I went to respawn him and found that some ranger had already done it and for some reason I do not know yet, he killed the little gnome. When I went to re-respawn him I couldn't get him to come back up. I was rather annoyed at this turn of events.</div></div><hr />
