You know, that just doesn't sound quite right does it...doesn't being a rogue mean you're not suppose to get hit much? So many questions about so many things... /sigh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raya</div><div class="date">04-20-06, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, all.  I've been a visitor and something of a lurker for a while now, more due to lack of time than lack of inclination.  Anyhow, I thought it was high time to introduce myself and thank the folks at The SafeHouse for all the great information they bring to the Vanguard community.<br />
<br />
I've been following (and reporting on) Vanguard for two years now, and it has been a wonderful journalistic ride.  I have never seen another game that had so many people drooling over it before BETA EVEN.  It's been fun and also great to have affiliates such as The SafeHouse - Vanguard wing producing such meaty fare (even when there wasn't much meat to produce :wink )<br />
<br />
However, I have to say that the lull has freed up some time that I have used to good advantage, i.e. writing up a storm, mainly my first love of fantasy fiction.  To this end, I posted one of my recently penned stories called Birth of a Unicorn (http://www.thesafehouse.org/forums/showthread.php?t=23911) in your Fireplace section.  Hopefully things like this will help to while away the time until either beta calls or the game goes live :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never been much of a forum junkie (too much to do IRL), but I recalled in my earlier EQ1 days how my guild raid leaders always came to this site for up to date information and contacts via other servers..<br />
<br />
Figured I should get a head start on that for Vanguard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Necro seems pretty cool, usually I play dps type ranger/scouts, the appeal of light fast hard hitting ( rangers lead the way ), have always appealed to me but now that I'm getting old the caster types seem really fun....<br />
<br />
Or im just gettin super lazy hah<br />
<br />
Pleased to meet you all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nyzmo</div><div class="date">08-22-06, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What he said...minus the stuff about casters (real men mellee!).  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I've never really spent much time on this site until now, but wow...I've been missing out.  Lots of good stuff here for rogues from all worlds.  I look forward to becoming an active community member once we get closer to Vanguards release, and we get some more activity on the Telon-side of the site. :thumb <br />
<br />
Glad to meet y'all!</div></div><hr />

If any newcomers have not had a chance to read up on the History of The Safehouse (http://www.thesafehouse.org/staff/shhistory.php), I encourage you to give this a read. It's informative and a delightful narrative! Boy, did that bring memories back to me!<br />

<br />
Yes it may be another mmorpg. But the interest is there and I believe it's going to do very well.<br />
<br />
The player impact in the world is going to be very nice but will be some time till we see player towns and cities develop but omg is that exciting to me.<br />
<br />
The game has everything I want in it...Minus a Brothel :rofl <br />
<br />
Marketing is good..not excellent but good. The Hype around this game is good.  It is US the players that will be 50% part of this developing of the game.<br />
<br />
What I mean is...half the game is design the other half is the community for mmorpg's in my humble opinion.  <br />
<br />
Can you imagine how things can be in VG?  All the player ships in Khal bay....<br />
Guilds Flying off to some Guild Keep on some mountain peek...I mean  this all seems very possible with what I have been reading.<br />
<br />
This is no WOW killer...nor an EQ2 killer...but I believe another Good Mmo to join the ranks of Eq,Daoc,AC, and WoW.<br />
<br />
Hell several friends I have not seen since WOW..(some went pve some went pvp) are banding together to join up in VG...<br />
<br />
And considering how games expand and develop...look at wow beta..and compare it to now with burning crusade...it's just daunting .<br />
<br />
Same goes for other mmorpgs like ffxi daoc etc..<br />
<br />
Considering this..&gt;VG has huge potential to be one of the greats after things get rolling and content gets added on... Just right now its so content heavy as it is....<br />
<br />
I don't know how things will end up...but I find many more reasons to believe that this game has a great chance on doing very well.  It's up to players and dev's to develop the world and see where we land.<br />
<br />
My optimism is high so far...and im normally a Skeptic at heart.</div></div><hr />

The rumors are true!<br />
<br />
Welcome back Vjek and Faited! (Sorry for my belated response).<br />
<br />
Warforge, If Vanguard has everything in it ye want except for a Brothel, maybe you should open one up? ;)<br />
<br />
In regards to the openness of Vanguard... one of the first things I did in Beta 1 was to climb all the mountain tops I could (this was before they adjusted &quot;steepness&quot; affecting us as much... and I should add realistically). I loved that I could get to the top and look as far as I could see (well as far as clipping plane allowed LOL).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-19-07, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vanguard is gonna kick-ass with wow. It will have a much huger world.<br />
Considering that like 90% of the areas in most mmorpg game worlds don't have anyone in them after a year, I wouldn't actually count that as a plus.<br />
<br />
It's just more space for nobody to go to.</div></div><hr />
