Can any one give me a run down on each and where i should put my spec points at certain lvls?  Kind of leaning toward the nightshade but they appear all the same to me...please enlighten me.  Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">03-23-02, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My perspective as a casual player (36 healer, 30 shadowblade)...<br />
<br />
Albion--most well developed content in the game.  Lack of dropped thrusters.<br />
Midgard--good item content, lack of high level content which makes leveling in the 40s significantly harder.<br />
Hibernia--reasonable high level content, spottier item content.<br />
<br />
Comparing the classes:<br />
Albion--most spec points, most complete assasin.  Playing the Maxi-min game, a slash using infiltrator briton is on paper probably the best assasin in the game.<br />
<br />
Midgard--benefits:  use of left axe (superior to the other dual wields in effectiveness) or two-handers, 5% more HP but most difficulty time soloing with their inability to pull and restealth.  Playing maxi-min, the Norse shadowblade may be the second best assasin in the game.  The lack of high level content is a significant demerit to me though, from what I hear from those in their 40s in my guild.<br />
<br />
Hibernia--a couple magic spells, but I don't see too many benefits.  Their shout spell doesn't do very much damage and takes up endurance to cast, so it's not free damage.  Their other spell has a casting time.  Lowest strength and con among races.  <br />
<br />
That said, the classes don't vary that much that any of their differences should be close to a deciding factor.  Just play what you want, and a good assasin will be better than an uber-race mediocre one.</div></div><hr />

Find what realm really appeals to you and play thier assassin. IMHO, the Infilitrator is the best, but the other two are very good as well.</div></div><hr />

thrust gives bonuses Vs. chain and reinforced, whereas thats the limited armor on hib and mid.<br />
slash doesent have a bonus, which comes to thust doing more dmg and faster <br />

<br />
Sb's 1 shot me, I do not do the same.<br />
<br />
Ns's destealth me far far too often, I do not do the same.<br />
<br />
Ns's also seem to hit much much quicker than I do even though I believe im using quick weapons.<br />
<br />
Given 1 on 1, if I get the first hit, I destroy the other 2.<br />

<br />
I'm a thruster and wouldn't change, I consider it to be more rounded out since I can fight the hybrid classes a tad better and still put up a good fight against the leather, cloth, studded wearers since thrust has the + to chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_divsgaze</div><div class="date">03-25-02, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">personally i believe nightshade to be the best of hte three..mainly because of the diamondback style....i feel that the shout for the .3 spec points is fair...they get slightly better melee, but with an evade based stun...you really cant lose..added to that a dd with a faster casting time than most mages...so if oyu want to you cna lock them up and they can never hit you with a spell.<br />
<br />
of course this is in straight up rvr..i've played a 50th levle inf, it was ok i mean i perf'd for 100 points harder cap....but i really missed my spells and stun style...<br />
<br />
sb is good, but well tbh they just dont cut it...no ranged attack is kinda bad.</div></div><hr />

Briton slasher is good. lvl10 Bsword hurts &amp;amp; slash still has fast weapons.<br />
The bonus you have on tanks(heh...), I get it back on archers and friends.<br />

<br />
Slash won't suck however.<br />
<br />
Thrust has bonuses versus classes that are hard for assassins to kill, tanks and healers.<br />
<br />
Slash has bonuses versus classes that are easy to kill (archers and casters).<br />
<br />
Thrust weapons in albion are more infiltrator friendly (featherlights - +5 dw, +2 slash)  (frenzy +4 envenom)<br />
<br />
Slash has amethyst slash, nice use anywher style, &gt;garrotte.<br />
<br />
I love getting the big ass bonus versus mids in chain.  it's how i kill healers.<br />
<br />
I killed a level 50 archer yesterday quite easily WITHOUT sticking my poisons.  He was red.  I.e. not being slash mattered not at all vs the studded leather hunter.)<br />
<br />
So my thougths are, &quot;if i can kill ared studded wearer while getting minuses, why do i need plusses.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_sneekeerz</div><div class="date">03-25-02, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">45 Saracen thrust Infiltrator, 31 Briton slash Infiltrator here. Gonna be my last post for Slash vs. Thrust.<br />
<br />
-Slash have slow weapons = huge PA = more chance of one shot kill.<br />
<br />
-Slash have fast weapons, some are as fast as 2.2 speed.<br />
<br />
-Slash have 15% bonus vs. leather, the armor which your arch enemy wears. Midgard assassins are all slashers, if you pick thrust, you'll be fighting 30% less effective compared to the Shadowblade. You will not win! A smart Shadowblade won't dance around with you lining up PA, they will just smack you when they see you. You will die because thrust is crap vs. leather.<br />
<br />
-Slash have 0% bonus vs. studded, while thrust have 10% penalty vs. studded. Always nice to hit harder on archers, espcially when you miss PA. A High spear spec hunter can sometimes kill you if you miss PA. With slashing bonus, they wont.<br />
<br />
-Slash have 15% penalty vs. chain, while thrust have 15% bonus vs. chain. Chain wearer = Hero, Warrior, Thane, Healer, Skald. These classes dont solo, sorry. So one on one with these classes are a rare occasion. Very risky as well, even if you drop PA, CD, SS on them. With my Saracen infil, I will bring a tank down to 50-60% after opening combos, sometimes I'm lucky, I will be able to finish them off, sometimes I die. And usually those kills are on dumb tanks or healer who dont use thier ability to the fullest. When a fight is not in thier favor, a healer will just insta mez-stun you and run away, a skald will insta-mez you and run away, a warrior/thane will Slam stun you for 9 secs and run away or chop you up, a Hero will turn into Antelope mode and smack you upside down. <br />
<br />
-Amethyst Slash &gt; Garotte, my lvl 31 Briton slasher have both Garotte and Amethyst Slash, vs. yellow, garotte bonus is about +20, while ammy slash is about +35. I expect the difference to only go bigger as I lvl more and put more points into slash. Ammy slash uses way less endurance, and no penalty to defense. On my Saracen Infil, i usually have little to no endurance left when i kill someone, because Garotte takes away huge chunks of stamina. It will kill you some times because you cant sprint away.<br />
<br />
-Do not worry about not being able to use thrusting frenzy, just equip it, apply poison, and swap back your slasher in. There is also a +3 envenom slasher from llyn.<br />
<br />
-Slash is str based, thrust is dex/str based. You will have higher weaponskill with thrust. Thus more accurate and more damage. But slash more than make up for this with superior styles that does tons more damage and gives better bonus to hit. Garotte is Medium bonus to hit, Ammy slash is Large bonus to hit. PA always hit.<br />
<br />
Go with slash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one shots are great and all...but at the very highest they cap at 772...one day everyone will hvae more hp than this effectivly making one shots useless..<br />
<br />
i'm not denying the fact the infiltrator has power, they do...but diamondback&gt;everything...it's the best assassin style in the game....i mean its a stun that does a ton of damage, then you get to chain the hamstring combo from it....<br />
<br />
my server does duels regularly, and while you can't say these are completly accurate because of the lack of surprise element, but even still the nightshades beat the infiltrators almost every time...all becuase of diamondback. it let us kill almost anyone....</div></div><hr />

The daggers cannot be equipped with poison and it is harder to pull a monster with a dagger without getting in its aggro range then going right up to it and doing a PA. I have an Infiltrator and a Nightshade alt, I think all of the assassin classes have their high points and their downfalls, I agree with Xumten in that the only real way to find a class you enjoy is by trying each out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I said, shadowblades do not have the ability to pull and restealth.  This means they cannot get a critical hit on a mob nearby by other aggressive mobs without often dying.  Midgard apparently has more aggressive mobs than other lands.  Soloing is very hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the intention was for spellcasters to not be able to sprint as long after casting a bunch of spells, like melee can't after fighting/styling a lot and rangers after shooting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Takes about 6 hours or less to make it to L6.<br />
<br />
Once I was sure I wanted Assassin I started;<br />
Jammer ; L6 Alb Inf Kay,<br />
<br />
Jammer ; L6 Mid SB Bors,<br />
<br />
Jammer ; L41 Hib Nightshade, Palomides. <br />
<br />
Two things should be apparent;<br />
1) I SUCK at new and exciting names and<br />
2) Hibernia won, for me. <br />
<br />
Before the flammen-wufers break out, that doesn't mean Oi'm right in choice of Hibernia. But considering the hours you do put in (say 300-400 to L40 mebbe another 200-400 to L50) is TWELVE hours to much to &quot;waste&quot; to be sure? <br />
<br />
Beats the crap outta spending 50 levels wondering &quot;did I make the right choice?&quot;. Anywho, the advice in the higher post is golden.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Malleable</div><div class="date">03-28-02, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadowblade is the best.<br />
2 handed weapons do more damage on the first hit.  No higher one shot weapon in the game but a 2h axe.  <br />
Slashing is all strength.  When you get items to up your stats its 1 for 1.  If you are a thruster you are effectively getting half the value of your items, as you are on dx/str.<br />
Left axe is superior to the other dual styles.  You always swing with both weapons, so even having a lower leftaxe value you can drop both poisons.  Left axe styles are also suppose to be very effective (but I havent done a comparison).<br />
Racewise.  Norse has the highest strength of any assasin and will do more damage per hit and on the one shot.  Also they have the lowest quickness in the game.  Since quickness reduces the damage done per hit on styles, it reduces our one shot abilitity.  Dx is nice for evades, but does nothing for hitting, and is only half a stat on thrusters.  Plus most dx items in the game come with quickness - so I dont want any.  Norse also have the highest con in the game, so they have more hps, and more endurance for styles - given that our heavy 2h weapons take alot out its a good thing, hehe.<br />
<br />
Nightshade shouts are pretty nice for interrupting casters.  Lurikeens have too much quickness.<br />
<br />
Infiltrators.  My friend is a Saracen infiltrator (though he recently started a Briton to test out the higher con).  He loves it and takes out SB and Nightshades all the time.  Wins far more than he loses.  He also loves thrusting.<br />
<br />
Im only 7th level, so I probably dont know squat.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">03-28-02, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think two handers are that great.  First, the style bonus you get for your opening strike is the same as a faster one hander.  All you do is do more damage with the two hander.  Those two handers really suck when it comes to reactive attacks.  Very hard to get a hamstring in.  Second, I think it's rather likely one-shot kills are getting nerfed considering Sanya's vision.  <br />
<br />
   And I think the difficulty of leveling in the 40s in Midgard is severe.  Our server has over 5 times as many Albs at level 50 than Middies.  Combining all other server numbers, Albs have around three times as many level 50s as Middies.  We're really screwed, no high level dungeon, and all too-social-aggressive mobs at the high levels, and only two rezzing classes (one broken, one the most nerfed class in the game).</div></div><hr />
