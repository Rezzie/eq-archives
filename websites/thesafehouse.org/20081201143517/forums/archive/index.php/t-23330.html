<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">03-12-06, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I am having to give up WOW because at the higher levels the instances are taking too much time for my wife to tolerate my playing.  I picked up D&amp;D Online from Frys ($38, woot) and will open it up if the trial period is fun... what I wanted to know is whether I will have the same problem with long dungeon crawls that I will not be able to leave?  How much can you accomplish things in a one or two hour sitting?  If you have to be grouped and going through dungeons, can you really accomplish much of anything?</div></div><hr />

Some of the higher level dungeons CAN take several hours to complete, but most if them aside from like... two or three can be done in a 1 or 2 hour sitting.</div></div><hr />
