<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">02-24-06, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the Safehouse needs an unofficial official guild for the game (Like there is in CoH/CoV, y'know?), I've realized, and we have all the more reason to do so immediately because those guilds who total over 25 members during the pre-release get recognized as founding guilds, and receive special items (A hat, if I remember right).<br />
<br />
So yeah, ideas for names would be a good thing... I'm tempted to just use The Safehouse (Pending approval, of course), but The Redeemed like we used in CoH would be an easy alternative as well. No matter what though, I want that hat! I mean... err... recognition as one of the first guilds... yeah...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">02-24-06, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So when exactly does it start, when is this pre-release stuff and when does DDO officially go live?<br />
<br />
I can buy the US version here in Germany, incl. the pre-release pack.. do I still need that? Will it still be in time, if I get it on Monday/Tuesday?<br />
<br />
Probably can't buy it in a store here...<br />
<br />
Edit: Okay, another phone call later... I can buy the boxed DDO game US version on Thursday, March 2nd. So do I need to get a pre-sale pack now so I can still help form the guild? Or is March 2nd enough?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">02-24-06, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with naming a guild 'The Safehouse' is, that even if you aren't officially representing this site, people see the tag and think you are. This is why Safehouse guilds are typically named something else, such as 'Honor Among Thieves' in CoV/CoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrooklynBridge</div><div class="date">02-24-06, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me know. I should have the box in the mail by the time I get home from work today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">02-24-06, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SX, the guild must be formed and have 25 members by the end of the pre-launch, so if it's still available (And you can still register a pre-release account) it would be great if you could do just that, heh.<br />
<br />
The official unofficial server we're gonna be on is Tharashk, as mentioned in one of the other DDO threads, and I'll be around as Teannin there, will brainstorm with Ragweed on guild name ideas and pick one out =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes, this time I did indeed get the US version (not as with CoV)</div></div><hr />
