<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zolden</div><div class="date">11-06-04, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I've been reading about EQ2 furiously for about the last week. As I'm sure alot of other Safehousers are, I exclusively play rogue classes. I try other things, but nothing seems to do it for me. Mainly I love the thief type of rogue. <br />
<br />
With Swashbucklers and Brigands(which is a bandit/highwayman) you'd think these classes are ripe with having steal abilities. Well I have not read anything that says so. <br />
<br />
There is, evidently, no pickpocket or steal ability for any class whatsoever. This really bugs me, because one of the biggest draws of these classes to me is stealthing and stealing. I loved running through Oasis and the deserts pickpocketing giants and running off in EQlive, as well as stealing so many quest items and thousands in plat. <br />
<br />
Anyone able to shed some light on this, or have heard anything otherwise? As of now I see absolutely no reason to play a scout class, and would much rather simply play a Shadowknight if there is no rogue defining skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thus a pickpocket skill is moot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joonling</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's actually useful though.  If you don't and there is a trap, they can range from mildly annoying to downright frustrating.  In fact, a trap killed my roommate because he was at half health when he sprung it.  The worst are the ones that last for 10+ min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Traps can be devastating to a group, but until today Disarm Traps was bugged in that it advance so slowly, by level 15 or so no scout class could even get the option to disarm chests anymore.  It works fine early on, but the skill rarely rises and can never hope to keep up with your level.  Unfortunately SoEs fix leaves a lot of higher level scouts high and dry, as they've got a lot of 'catching up' to do which is pretty unfair considering it wasn't their fault they couldn't raise the skill in the first place.<br />
<br />
Also, I've yet to encounter a mob with coin loot.  I never used pickpocket much in EQ anyway so I don't miss it, but it would have been nice for them to throw in some novelty ability involving stealing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did anyone figured it out yet?<br />

<br />
However on some of the quests where u need to steal.. u can just do it cos its scripted  and that can be quite fun.<br />
<br />
I really thought a lack of pickpocket would be a down side but u really dont miss it and the number of other skills u get instead more than make up for it...track, pathfinder and disarm to name but 3!</div></div><hr />
