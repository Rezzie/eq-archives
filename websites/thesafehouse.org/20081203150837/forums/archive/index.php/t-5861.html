I got a few screen shots, didnt get to see most of it.. but I got there and (It was a lower level quest) they needed skunk glands to return themselves to normal.. I tracked about 20 skunks total and gave them 1 each.. they gave me food/drink and 25 PP. They mentioned Al'Kabor a few times and some other name I forgot.</div></div><hr />
