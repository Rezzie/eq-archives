I went ahead and ordered the PHB and the DMG (lost my other one /grumble) and with the &quot;free&quot; shipping I managed to get both for almost the same cost as picking one up from a local Waldens.<br />
<br />
Just thought I would share.<br />

<br />
I just find it insanely silly they want $40 list price for those things at a bookstore (Walden's, BDalton etc).<br />
<br />
/em promises next time he orders from Amazon he will go through the Safehouse link.<br />
<br />
Could we possibly get it stickied as a reminder?  I would not offence at the gratuitous self promotion  <br />
<br />
You can even list my e-mail for any flames about it.  Sillis@biteme.net   <br />

Amazon is always cheaper though.  We were going to have a 3-pack deal for $70 (save $20 that way) in Aug or Sep, but it looks like we may not.</div></div><hr />
