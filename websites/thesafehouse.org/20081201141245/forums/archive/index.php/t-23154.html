We'll be sure to accommodate ya...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jenner Blackblood</div><div class="date">04-21-06, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just started up!  Lvl 1 Fighter by the name of Jennar.  Still getting a feel for the game, but I'm more than happy to lend a hand if you could use me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">04-21-06, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On tharashk? I will invite as soon as I can. By the way, if ya want, and have extra time, start up a character, rogue or mage maybe, on lazzar(sp) level him up to 2 or 3 maybe if ya can if you have time, SH group night would love to have ya, real fun indeed. Try to get together once sometimes twice a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sillis</div><div class="date">04-23-06, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a couple characters on Tharashk server.  Drindal (Ran/Fight), Aloria (Cleric), and a Rogue/Ran I just rolled (and the name escapes me *blush*).  I would love to have a few more options for steady (albeit low level) grouping.<br />
<br />
*edit* Clarified which server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">04-23-06, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can only speak for myself, dunno about rag or yal or the others. I have been really busy lately, only finding time to get together for group night. Hopefully some time will free up and I will be able to get on tharashk again in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">04-23-06, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Between DDO, WoW and CS:S my time is stretched thin also.  Group night seems to be the night I play.  Heck my rogue is still lvl 5 or Tharashk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">04-23-06, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But yea, if anyone is interested in joining group night we have three that always show up, and two that show up if they can. If you want a sure fire group (that by the way is really fun, we do the hardest missions with the smallest chance of success and still beat the powergamers at their own... game) once or twice (its becoming twice maybe) a week, then .. where was I going with this... Oh yea, get a character (pref a caster, or rogue) to level 2-3ish on Lhazaar and every sat at 8 est and sometimes fri at .. (random) est join us. If you need help getting through water works to get into the marketplace I'm sure we can help ya with that.</div></div><hr />
