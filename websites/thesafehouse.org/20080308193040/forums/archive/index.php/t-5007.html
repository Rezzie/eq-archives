<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Morinn</div><div class="date">04-01-02, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have put different weapons in and out of my off hand and I never see my weapon skill or damage on teh main character screen change.<br />
<br />
This leads me to wonder if I can put a blade, something I am not trained in, in my off hand and it will not matter to my damage or chance of hit with it. <br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm my theory?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Valarauco</div><div class="date">04-01-02, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are the weapons orange?  WeapDam is capped per-level, and orange weapons will exceed the cap (and thus display the same number when you switch them).<br />
<br />
To help you read WeapDam, an explanation of the display: the zero second-from-right is supposed to be a period.  For example, 906 WeapDam = 9.6 DPS; 1406 WeapDam = 14.6 DPS.<br />
<br />
Also, I believe WeapDam and WeapSkill only  display for your mainhand, but the damage of your offhand is  definitely affected by your spec the same way your main hand is.  Also keep in mind that the main thing affected by weapon spec is damage variance (because it gives you a higher Min damage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Morinn</div><div class="date">04-01-02, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok thats all I was wanting to know. I just was thinking that the CD skill would be all teh off hand used and not the primary skill. Because based on my exp with axe/left axe I kepy my weapon skill max and still saw only lower hits with the off hand.<br />
<br />
Sad to say this but the only reason I was wondering is I got a real nice particle effect off hand sword that I guess will be trade bait for a piercer I can use.</div></div><hr />

Dual Wield and Celtic Dual are different in that they only affect your chance to swing with both weapons.<br />
<br />
Using a 16.2 Blade when you are speced in Pierce is like... like... well like using a very low-DPS Pierce weapon, except you'll get some high hits now and then (but overall damage the same).<br />
