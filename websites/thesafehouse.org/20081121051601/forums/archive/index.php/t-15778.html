<br />
However, Ringing blow is lagged or bugged or something, I must wait like 1-2 seconds before I hit quickstrike to complete, and eventhen sometims it doesn't trigger the ringing blow.<br />
<br />
Anyone else noticing this problem?  It has gotten me killed a few times and a huge PITA.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't complete if the mob parries or you miss, at least as far as I've noticed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kallel</div><div class="date">11-24-04, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I miss on Ringing Blows also.  I do believe it is due to a miss or dodge/parry although I haven't been able to confirm this as I have my battle spam turned off.  I sometimes have to try a different strike or two before it lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotcana wupaz</div><div class="date">11-24-04, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm maybe that is it, I could swear it used to land all the time though.<br />
<br />
I have all that crap turned off too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slyy Daugg</div><div class="date">11-24-04, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, you can miss on a swindler's luck too and it won't go off.  Basically you must land your regular attack for the HO to complete.<br />
<br />
BTW, why do they call it &quot;Swindler's Luck&quot; when it's about the most unlucky thing that can happen?  Every time it goes off, I feel like I'm the one who got swindled!<br />

It adds something like 10% damage to your specials. In a full group, that's a pretty nice jump. And as we gain in levels, I'm sure it'll become more apparentl, as well. Yeah, it sucks when it comes up twice. But just finish it quickly and move on.</div></div><hr />
