I prefer throwing daggers over the bows and what not, but what about those that prefer bows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maliphus_Iscariot</div><div class="date">03-12-07, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure its in the bow slot and not the ammo slot. I had the same problem at first.<br />
<br />
I use Arc of Dagger in AoE spam groups in Southwatch.</div></div><hr />

It's not a skill thing is it?   Check you skills for Thrown Weapons and/or Thrown Daggers.  Not sure which one it is.</div></div><hr />

t2 crafted throwing daggers i think is 150<br />
t3 crafted throwing daggers i think is 250<br />
<br />
I am at 253 skill and able to use the t2 and t3 crafted ones already for the normal ranged attack just not for Arc of daggers (both 1 &amp; 2).. could anyone else please test and verify this if its a bug or not... I would rather use the higher dmg crafted over the merchant throwing daggers :(</div></div><hr />
