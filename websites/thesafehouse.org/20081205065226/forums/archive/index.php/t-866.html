<br />
Watching an episode on SciFi now.  Woot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">03-09-04, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just aired the pilot/first episode last thursday,and every day since then.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gaav</div><div class="date">03-09-04, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I saw the adds for this a while ago, and I couldn't believe it made it onto network television.  For those who don't know, this used to have some episodes (much shorter if I remember right) floating around on the net.  I only saw a couple but it was some funny, nasty stuff.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I caught the pilot tonight, and it was great.  I'm fairly sure that there was a joke in there to offend pretty much everyone (and the theme of the episode was targetted to offend a ton of people).  I loved it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was a little suprised to see the alien reporter getting sodomized while giving a newsreport.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">03-10-04, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You mean there was more than one episode before?<br />
The only one I saw was the one that was on the Playboy.com Animation Contest.  Any links to the others?<br />
<br />
And yes, I was also surprised that it was on TV.</div></div><hr />

I was refering to the episodes that he mentioned were floating around the net, unless I read that wrong and the episodes in this &quot;Series&quot; are those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gaav</div><div class="date">03-10-04, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sure there was 1on the net, but I vaguely recall others.  However, keep in mind Im just going off of memory from 4-5 years ago when I was at Wazzu.  It could have been the person who uploaded it had done it into several files maybe, or any number of things.</div></div><hr />
