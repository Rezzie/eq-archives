<br />
I suppose this is going to be the first of many posts on this type of subject so I will make it quick and give you all the information that you are most interested in.<br />
<br />
Dark Province is a group that is loking to eventually spread into making their own city once Vanguard is up and going. The structure of the entire province has been completed and is ready for members to begin filling these positions. The link below will provide information as to the means of joining, which will require that you fill out a simple application so that it may be reviewed and you will be able to find out on the page in a short amount of time if you have been accepted.<br />
<br />
While we are few in numbers, we have only just started allowing new members. The reason that I post on these forums is that within the province we are developing a Rogue guild. One that will be called on as another tool of the province with its own leadership and semi-independence from the Province. Currently there are a good deal of leadership positions available within the province, and nearly 9 available within the rogues guild itself. Before becoming involved with the guild you will first need to be accepted by the Dutchess for membership to the Province. Afterwhich, you may send a private message to me on the forums and we'll begin working together on where you would best fit in the workings of the Rogues guild.<br />

Thanks for your time, the link is below.<br />

Its one of those things that you must build into a guild in order to provide an outlet for RP once in release. Setting up where the RP can begin ahead of time severely limits that awkward RP among players that makes no sense.<br />
<br />
Naturally a Rogues guild is going to have difference among a province, though everyone starting out at 18 years old, if you go off the MUD aspects, a new rogues guild would need to be under some sort of direction in order to get its feet planted and start its own direction.<br />
<br />
I also forgot to mention that built within the structure are paths for battle, arcane, healers, and holy. Link is below to the structure page.<br />
