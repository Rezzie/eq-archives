<br />
Petitions were made, Guides answered, and eventually another Guide (Thanks Taidin :P) came and said the spawn tables were being fixed due to bugs.<br />
<br />
Upon questioning, it was due to certain NPC's having more health than they should, and not fighting back. Of course, this could only mean the Teir'Dal prisoner of Lanys T'Vyl, Valizrae D'tora, down way back on the 3rd floor.<br />
<br />
So, if the spawn tables haven't been pulled from your server yet, you may have lost your chance to attempt to get a dual assassination with a dual backstab. Edited by: Berdusk  at: 7/9/01 1:09:54 pm</div></div><hr />

I was all prepared to cry and complain and kick myself for not enjoying befallen sooner.  Thank you for informing us of what is going on.  I will be logging back in now to alert the rest of my server (which has no clue as to what the issue is.)  Even the GUIDES told me that they didn't know what was going on &quot;we have no official word from the GM's yet.&quot;  Apparently my server gets the red headed stepchild treatment a lot.

<br />
The remaining parts of the quest that I still have to do are, as you know, the hemo homey, and the Clockwork CX in Sol A.  I have all of the previous items (as listed in the library on this site).  I have never set foot in Sol A before so I don't know whether I should consider myself almost done or just getting to the tough parts, but I have seen post stating that Lynada is one tough cookie.  So I guess we will see about that when I get to that point.  I am going to log back into EQ now just to see if any of you happen to be on right now.  It is nice to see someone else actually plays on Zeb.  =)<br />

*UPDATE*  <br />
Sleep is for the weak.<br />
Quote from Xepante (the weak) Whisperblade.<br />
<br />
I signed back on at midnight.  Arafain was online and stated he would help me in 90 minutes.  Being super excited I started my travel back to Mistmoore (Was playing around in Infected Paw.)  Come 2:30am Arafain sends me a message that he was now in Steamfront headed for MM.  The next thing I know, the sound of my alarm clock wakes me at 6:30am telling me I need to get ready for work.  I look at my computer and all I see are the words You are hungry, You are thirsty.  *sigh*  I was so close...if only I didn't need sleep.  I want to thank you Arafain for attempting to help.  I will be camped at the MM zone all day from 1pm until I get the bottle.

I'm sorry to hear about your...missed attempt at getting the Blood Spirits.  I got lucky yesterday, and found a 52nd Necro in the fountain room off of the courtyard where the Hemo stands.  Couldn't believe my luck!  So, needless to say, I got the spirits.  And this morning I got lucky and got help whacking Lynada, so I got the purse!  If I hadn't spent days camping the Brewer in BB, and hadn't died a couple of times along the way to other parts of the quest, I wouldn't feel worthy. I'm sooo close now. &amp;lt;happy sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
Regarding Befallen--thanks for the updates!  It's what I came to the Safehouse for today.  I dropped in there last night to work up lock-pick and it was NERFED!  :-O  Hopefully they'll all be back in the next patch.<br />

<br />
You had the misfortune to fall asleep right as I zoned in....I spent a couple minutes jumping in front of you hoping the noise would bring you around, and I had my druid friend nuke you a couple of times....no luck.  I cleared the courtyard and killed the Hemo Enologist before I left, and sent you a tell that the courtyard was clear if you wanted to run in and loot the blood spirits - I also tried to get Bakzuk to wake you up, but no dice.<br />
<br />
I'll be on again today at 7pm CST (9pm your time).  If you still haven't gotten the blood spirits by then, I'll be happy to swing by mistmoore and kill her again for you before I get back to exp'ing.  -- Arafain Entreri, 58 Blackguard<br />

I have seen post on &quot;other&quot; web sites stating that it has been nerfed.  Of course I came here to find out if that was true or just posted by someone who was tired of waiting.  Considering the amount of times I killed Korven Niseres I am very willing to believe that it has been taken out of the game, but I would like to know for certain.  After all, you all know my luck in the past.  The moment I walk out of the room he will pop dual welding the stilettos just to rub it in.  So can anyone confirm that he STILL drops the weapon?</div></div><hr />

The SRS and Servant's Blades both look pretty cool.  When not fighting I keep those two weapons equipped for the look.  I get a lot of inspects and inquiries now.  Sorry, no screen shots at this time.<br />

Like I said before, they are a bit slow but when you proc about every 1 in 4, the extra 37dmg adds up quick!                                                                    <br />

It has been 3 days since then and no luck for either of us.  It even seems like the guy is popping less often.  I would be really depressed having to wait so long if it wasn't for the fact that every so often something blue pops for me and I get experience...and the fact that I make soooo much money down there.  Oh well, I will stay there for another 5 days or so just to see if it is actually an 8 day thing of not.</div></div><hr />
