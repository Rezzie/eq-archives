<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SHStaff</div><div class="date">05-28-06, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SUMMARY: Summer 2006 is coming in three weeks, and it's time for the list! Contrary to the last Spring 2006 season, this one is significantly smaller - with only 29 series, half of last season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Listed within is all the names, the date they air, and links to the official websites, and summaries. You can find what you are interested in to download right as they come out, otherwise I will be reviewing series and you can check those out too in order to get some idea of what you think you'll like that you have missed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the significantly smaller size, there's a great variety of shows to be had.&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Honey &amp;amp; Clover&lt;/span&gt; for the fans of the first season, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Tsuyokisu&lt;/span&gt; for the eroge adaptation fans, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Chokotto Sister&lt;/span&gt; for the moe~ crowd, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;NHK ni Youkoso&lt;/span&gt; for the hardcore fans, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Coyote Ragtime Show&lt;/span&gt; for the shounen fans, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Binbo Shimai Monogatari&lt;/span&gt; for the slife-of-life fans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A nice selection, and hopefully a good amount would turn out to be wonderful!&lt;br&gt;<br />

<br />
<br />
What I'm personally looking forward to is Honey &amp; Clover the second season, Binbou Shimai Monogatari, Bokura ga Ita, Mamotte! Lollipop, Chokotto Sister, NHK ni Youkoso, and Tsuyokisu.<br />
<br />
Do you all remember Tohsaka Rin from Fate/Stay Night? Her behavior pattern, where she is very strict at times, and when Shirou says something that gets to her, she blushes and becomes somewhat vulnerable. This behavior is tsundere, the basis of the whole game of Tsuyokisu (Strong Kiss directly translated, but makes no sense. It's kind of a pun on Tsundere, you could say. An act of strength, and a act of passion, individually. <br />
<br />
I'm suprised the eroge is not based around the male lead, but one of the girls. It's unknown as of yet whether the male lead will be there or not, but if he's not it'll be quite interesting.<br />
<br />
I'm also looking forward to Honey and Clover which should be more serious this season.<br />
<br />
And man, will Chokotto Sister fill my little niche :p I can't wait! Those extremely averse to things that might seem close to lolicon would want to stay away from this.<br />
<br />
I'm definitely looking forward to NHK. It's a little more hardcore and over-the-top version of Genshiken. It almost goes without saying that if you enjoyed Genshiken, you'll enjoy NHK. On the topic of Genshiken.... the previously rumored second season turned out to be a season of Kujianbiki Unbalance, not Genshiken S2. I'm half disappointed.</div></div><hr />

OMG Genshiken was awesome. If this is true then this show should prove interesting!. Altho i am a bit saddened by the no S2 of Genshiken =/. Kinda surpriseing that they decided to make it a Kujianbiki Unbalance show.</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised I hadn't heard of this before.  I wonder how the PPG creator, Craig McCracken feels about it since he probably didn't have any say in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-29-06, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually heard about this nearly a year ago, because I was lurking 2c at the time. Well more like, I heard about it in the form of a sudden new wave of fanart, so I did a little research. <br />
<br />
Unless he was making a &quot;public statement,&quot; if I recall correctly, he actually was happy to hear about his cartoon being made into an Japanese animation.<br />
<br />
Thanks SX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">05-29-06, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that's cool, as long as he's happy about it.  Too often creators of western shows are pretty much stripped of all rights to their creations and then we see things done with them later that the creators don't appreciate, and have no recourse at all.</div></div><hr />
