If facing the ocean while on the dock, just run/swim to the right past the harbor wall, and you will see the beached ship.  Up the hill are the two mentioned in the story text.  Both lvl 65, indifferent.<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp nods at you with a slight smile. 'Salutations traveler. We are busy unloading a few supplies from our ship. We have certainly sailed a long way on waves of [rumors]. You wouldn't happen to have heard anything about, uhm, some developments nearby?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What rumors?'<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp goes mum for a moment and looks back to Nedaria Debeian. You feel your temples tingle as you meet her piercing stare. She looks to Morden and shrugs. 'I've heard murmurings that there is a charred forest nearby that is thickening with tales regarding the [Sarnak]. I'm waiting for a few friends of mine to arrive so we can get a closer look.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Who are the Sarnak?'<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp turns to look at Nedaria again and she shakes her head.  'Well, it appears that you know about as much as I do. Perhaps one of us will know more soon. Until then, we must get prepared to explore these lands. Good day to you.'<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Well, it points to Burning Woods and Chardok obviously.  <br />
<br />
Post findings here.  (And what's with Nedaria's Jedi Mind trick?  :-)    )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Grevan</div><div class="date">06-22-03, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tired to get some information outa him and nothing worked here are some of the things i tried.<br />
<br />
1) i mentioned the brood of Di`zok to him and the sarnak colective along with the names of the king and queen.  He didnt reply.<br />
<br />
2) gave him regal band of the bathezid, and the spirit wracked chords.  He just gave them back.<br />
<br />
3) obviously he directing to burning woods so i took a tracker there with me and checked the &quot;developments&quot; that was mentioned... nothing new around the giant fort or chardok castle outside.<br />
<br />
4) ran inside chardok and checked all around there thinking maybee they went inside and got caught or something.  i found alot of sarnaks and dogs but no rogue and his friends.<br />
<br />
5) decided that maybee his friends are still on the way to him so i took the same tracker to TD and checked ogre island, chessboard island and took the boat to see if i could find anything.  also checked raptor and spiroc islands in case they were shipwrecked or something.<br />
<br />
i didn't check Warsilk woods yet or the island between BB and FV but i'll try those today and post what i find.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Grevan</div><div class="date">06-22-03, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i tried to get information outa the dark elf.  he refused to say anything to me other than the orriginal hail message.  so i did what any rogue would do.  Killed him.<br />
very strange fight though.  no melee damage hurts him from PCs.  i had a druid, shaman, cleric, necro, wiz, and myself there.  Dots, pet damage, nukes and DS all landed.  used wicked shank, tendonslicer, and poison to hold aggro.  he doesn't resist much so snare from tendonslicer worked... everyone else loaded up on dots and pet damage and took about 45 min to kill.... all to loot the empty corpse.  He hits for about 675 or so quad with a pet, and has a 1151 HT (level 65)<br />
<br />
Later when he respawned i tried to drag him into the camp and escape him off... he just stood there so the rogue and his friend didn't seem to care.  SK (hiding DE) just walked back to his rock.<br />
<br />
As for other places to look i havn't found anything yet. will post more later</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Flacked</div><div class="date">06-23-03, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh man.  I looked for this thread but missed it before I created a new one.  Oh well let mine die.  Here is the complete text from the story and the NPCs thus far:<br />
<br />
Rumors on the Wind<br />
<br />
The filthy waters lap rhythmically at the shores of The Overthere. A well-worn boat parts the veil of lazy mist hanging still in the air as it makes its last strides toward land. The strained hull groans softly as it swims toward the sands, finally grating onto the shore.<br />
A tall, tattered figure stands at the bow. His stature and the breadth of his shoulders give away his Barbarian heritage. His eyes, gray as the waters, flit along the sands toward the outpost looming nearby as he assesses the immediate dangers. <br />
<br />
Seemingly satisfied, he walks amidships, puts a hand on the side of his boat, Thorn of the White Rose. He jumps over the edge to land knee-deep in water with barely a splash or sound. <br />
<br />
With that landing, Morden Rasp took another step on the path of a rumor -- one that set him upon the waves and one that he intends to follow to its end. He has heard of trouble amongst the Sarnak. <br />
<br />
Morden walks from the surf to a steep incline where grains of sand meet the grass. He leaves no trace; no footprints. As his body rises up to a ledge, he crouches in perfect relationship, his presence barely detectable<br />
<br />
He sees no trace of passing patrols, only wildlife wanders nearby as the willful rogue kneels motionless and quiet for a short time. The deep creases in Morden's brow begin to smooth as he sees no enemies. In ferine movements, he moves back from the ledge. On the sands once again, he turns and slips silently back to the boat. <br />
<br />
&quot;All is clear Nedaria,&quot; he says in a voice that travels on the air in soft baritones. &quot;It looks like we found ourselves an adequate spot. I need to survey the area before we set up camp though. Come down<br />
<br />
A hardened Erudite face peers over the side of the boat at Morden<br />
<br />
&quot;Lend me a hand?&quot; she asks as she folds back the sleeves of her robe<br />
<br />
&quot;I shall, but you must read my fortune tonight,&quot; he says, with a slanted grin<br />
<br />
&quot;You never do anything for free, do you?&quot; Nedaria huffs as she lowers the scruffy rope ladder. <br />
<br />
He holds her gently as she carefully makes her descent onto the sands. <br />
<br />
Morden and Nedaria turn and walk up the beach together. They are age-old companions, moved by loyalty to one another and adventure...anywhere<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;Not far from the book in The Overthere, along the top of the cliffs, are two npcs named Morden Rasp and Nedaria Debein.&gt;<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Morden Rasp'<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp looks at you with a slight smile. 'Salutations traveler. We are busy unloading a few supplys from our ship. We have certainly sailed a long way on waves of [rumors]. You wouldn't happen to have heard anything about, uhm, some developments nearby?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'rumors'.<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp goes mum for a moment and looks back at Nedaria Debeian. You feel your temples tingle as you meet here piercing stare. She looks at Morden and shrugs. 'I have heard murmerings that there is a charred forrest nearby that is thickening with tales regarding the [Sarnak]. I am waiting for a few friends of mine to arrive so we can get a closer look.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Sarnak'.<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp turns to look at Nedaria again and she shakes here head. 'Well, it appears that you know about as much as I do. Perhaps one of us will know more soon. Until then, we must get prepared to explore these lands. Good day to you.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Nedaria Debeian'<br />
<br />
Nedaria Debein focuses and your mind tingles. She shows little interest in you and turns to look at Morden.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;nearby is a Dark Elf shadow knight hiding behind a rock&gt;<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Tondal Di'Xevar'<br />
<br />
Tondal Di'Xevar says 'Please move along. I do not want my presence well known to those in that camp.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Grevan</div><div class="date">06-23-03, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they are indifferent to everyone that i've talked to so far.  i've killed in KC, HS so they arent on VS faction.  I'm ally to sarnaks so they arent on sarnak or goblin faction either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also I noticed an extra Metal short dude in the bank 'Bankers assistant' who asks for the Metal key.<br />
<br />
If this any help what so ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Yella01</div><div class="date">06-25-03, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The extra npc near the bankers is probably for one of the iksar class quests. I believe that one of them (necro I think) required that you hand stuff to the bankers. Bankers were changed a few patches ago not to accept things from players in order to avoid people accidently giving them things instead of banking them. In doing so they broke the iksar quest, and the new npc is likely the fix.<br />
<br />
On a related note, it's been a long while since I've been in OT, but I noticed that the OT book is where the alchemist for the Greenmist quest used to be. Any idea where he is located now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Halbar</div><div class="date">06-25-03, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The alchemist guy who runs faster than any bard when agrod actually sits closer to the entrance guarded by the gargoyles, not too far from the pok book...just past that openening the golem guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swendal Ravenclaw</div><div class="date">06-30-03, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would seem that the conversation here has changed in the past week. The barbarian now says his messenger has arrived that he and his crew are preparing the mount an expedition to head out to Chardok to take a peak on whats going on. Sorry that I dont have an exact transcription of the conversation. He isnt far from the book anyways, so go check it out  <br />
<br />
Oh, and the dark elf seems to be standing at the campfire now instead of hiding behind a rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HooVooLoo</div><div class="date">07-01-03, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">(Barbarian guy) Morden Rasp winks and captures you with an engaging grin. 'Bonnie day, eh? Not sure what brings ye to these parts, but it's grand to lay eyes on a fellow traveler. Do ye 'ave somethin' ye're wantin' to share with me? I've 'eard a few [tales] we could swap, if'n yer interested of course.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What tales'?<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp says 'Ayuh, ye're the curious sort. Got me a soft spot for ye're kind. I 'ave been hearing stories of strife within the Brood of Di'Zok. A [messenger] was supposedly speakin' out of turn about intrigue in the very bowels of the Sarnak empire. It leaves a rough un like meself wonderin' what it all means.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What messenger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp says 'I don't know all the ins and outs, but word is that an imperial messenger was overheard at the castle gates chirpin' of downright 'orrible treachery and torture within Chardok itself. Tensions are a-buildin' within that castle and I 'ear they've doubled the guard within the royal chambers. I reckon I'll be learnin' [more] about it soon, if'n I don't let it get the best of me and take a peek meself!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp says 'Sorry wee scrapper, I need to get back to it before m'lady Nedaria catches me slackin'. Me and me crew are readying for an expedition and I've got me a pile of work to be doin'. Perhaps I'll be crossin' paths with ye again. Who knows, eh?'<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
(Jedi Mind Trick chick)  Nedaria Debeian shows a stoic glance, as you feel an invasion of your thoughts. 'Ah, another curious traveler. I'm afraid we know little more than you, but we are certain we will know more soon. We have paid handsomely for information.'<br />
<br />
No responses.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
(DEF)  Tondal Di`Xevar hesitates as he searches for words in the Common tongue. 'I have.. little to say. My new friends are wiser about the troubles within the.. Brood of Di'Zok.'<br />
<br />
No difference when trying other languages for the hail.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Morden no longer responds to the older hails, like 'Who are the Sarnak?' Edited by: HooVooLoo  at: 7/1/03 2:30 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
OT has changed again lots more people there now and they are intested in info on Korocust (the shapeshifter).....<br />
<br />
anyone got any of those letters they could try handing in?</div></div><hr />

None of the new ones say anything useful.  The rest say new stuff, but I didn't log it.  They basically say the same thing the story window indicates.<br />

Quote: Make sure you try to hail him in other languages.<br />

I'm waiting for SoE to use this outside of PoP somewhere...<br />
<br />
The Dark Elf will respond to Dark Speech and says something different then if you hail him in Common.</div></div><hr />

Times are getting a tad interestin' wouldn't ye say?  I 'ave been gettin' bits and pieces of [news] from 'ere and there and it would seem something is definitely a-brewin' over in Chardok.  I tell ya, nuttin' gets me goin' like the promise of adventurin'.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'What news?'<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp says ''Well, ye see, it's a wee bit rough puttin' the story together.  Not that a good puzzle ever stopped me!  From what I been gatherin', there are traitors in the Brood of Di'Zok itself.  There is some chatter about a [shapeshifter] at work in there, but no one can tell me who it is.  Darned frustratin', I tell ye.  I'm not good with patience, as my friends will tell ye.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'What shapeshifter?'<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp elbows you playfully in the ribs.  'Bah, I was hoping you could tell me who it is!  As many folk as I 'ave seen, ye'd think I'd have more of an inklin', eh?  Thankfully, I got me new friends that'll be keeping' me company while we hope for more .  I think we're getting close to gatherin' this wee collection of scallywags we got 'ere to take a look for ourselves.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What information?'<br />
<br />
Morden Rasp winks at you.  'Well, if'n I knew what it was, I'd tell ye!  Do drop back on us and share your tales should you hear more, eh?  Be well.'<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Tondal Di`Xevar says,in Dark Speech, ''Greetings.  I see you are learned in Dark Speech.  I, myself, am being taught the languages of the world by Nedaria, but it is a slow process.  We are looking for more news about the trouble in Chardok.  I feel a distinct evil presence whenever the topic is discussed.  I fear there is a great foe walking with the Brood of Di'Zok.''<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Nedaria Debeian says ''Well hello, adventurous spirit.  I can't imagine what would bring you to this awful place.  The surroundings are frightful.  I'm somewhat pleased that we will likely be traveling soon.  I can feel conflict on the breeze as it passes through my mind.''<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
The other peeps don't respond to their native tounges, so I guess this is going in piecemeal.  I hope this is actually a quest and not just some &quot;teaser&quot; that is only saying, &quot;Hey, Chardok is changing soon!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's like, uh, we know that already.<br />

(complete wishlist) A continuation of the SWC quest. Open rebellion begins in chardok and you must take the side of the Di'zoks, or their enemies. 10th ring war/ring of fire hybrid. Open warfare in chardok. Dungeoncrawling an army through an opposing army. Key points to hold and defend. Maybe VS could even take over the imperial palace and have to be booted out.<br />

I'd come by to zap the Chancellor for his Jade Prod. The weaponsmith popped out at me as the only light blue mob on my tracking for my level 62 druid. They were located in a small room in the NW corner of the fort if I remember correctly.<br />

<br />
I saw them near the book to Pok in Freeport.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
That's the Wayfarer's Brotherhood,BTW. Expect to see a lot them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ancaglon</div><div class="date">08-22-03, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Morden and the Dark Elf (surnamed 'deceiver'  ) are now lurking near the PoK book in West Freeport, waiting for the Madman touched by Zebuxoruk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zorrco</div><div class="date">08-24-03, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;madman&quot; (Calliav) now appears with Morden at the book in WFP. (Notice the Storyline addition from Saturday). He babbles text if you sit and listen for a while but nothing that makes much sense (not yet). If you hail him a few times you'll get a standard set of two or three responses. Most of it is about &quot;the darkness&quot;.<br />
<br />
Morden doesn't provide any information outside of him waiting for Nedaria.<br />
<br />
Nedaria (and crew) are still in Lavastorm. Text is completely changed from a few days ago. Apparently they are preparing to pack up the camp and head to WFP to meet Morden and Calliav (the crazy mage). All of the other npcs provide the same &quot;packing up&quot; storyline and I couldn't find any triggers for anyone.<br />
<br />
I hadn't followed this storyline until I spotted them in WFP, so I read this thread first. An interesting note (I think), the Dark Elf Tondall, who was hiding earlier is now with the party, and he still gives a different reply if you hail him in Dark Speech. Something about learning Common Tongue and buying armor from a travelling salesman.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried hailing the other races in their native tongues... same replies as with common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AphasiaTZ</div><div class="date">08-26-03, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe these NPC's are SOE's way of explaining the changes and additions of content.  The NPC's seem fixed in their positions and replies until a new patch/zone revamp comes out...much in the way of the Firiona Vie storyline when Kunark came out.  Whether or not these NPC's will lead to quests remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />
