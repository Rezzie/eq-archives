My original plan was to auto-train until 48 and then spend all the saved points on stealth raising it to my end-spec goal.<br />
<br />
But....<br />
<br />
Watching the number of banked points grow is starting to worry me, are there bugs associated with it? any limits I've not heard about etc... <br />
<br />
When I get to 48 I will have around 700 pts banked, have any of you ever done this?  Have any of you had any problems doing this?</div></div><hr />
