I was going to use a L18 cleric for a mule on the first floor (drag the magician to cleric's camp spot, log in cleric, revive magician, log out). What I was wondering is:<br />
<br />
i. Is this an idiotic plan?<br />
ii. Does Vex Thal have a minimum level to zone in?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I was gonna plop him in the corner of one of the alcoves in the room with the first named slime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and that has nothing to do with anything because he would still need to get a key for his cleric for him to do his job regardless of how fast he leveled the cleric.</div></div><hr />

Also is your mage ok with losing that much exp each time you need to set up coh this way? Raid exp is not exactly top notch. Perhaps your best plan of action would be to use a cleric or mage that someone in your guild has retired and get them to park it there, or, if you are independently wealthy (^_~), purchase a stripped 56+ cleric account purely for the purpose of parking him there.  Perhaps it will even come with a VT complete.  Edited by: Maeya82 at: 10/13/03 6:32 am</div></div><hr />

Rez when a needed part drops, kill cleric after looting. Basically keep dead until needed.<br />
<br />
Same goes for getting cleric to the spot inside VT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lomack</div><div class="date">10-13-03, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no hard proof.  But I wouldn't be supprised to see a level 46+ restriction on VT.  There is one on ToV and its not a plane.  So unless you have seen someone in VT lower than 46th level.  All this effort could be for not, and you would still need to level the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_BaxstarrBuyan</div><div class="date">10-13-03, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO if you get the cleric the VT key and find he can't zone in til 47 then getting him 47 should be easy in comparison.<br />
<br />
Crappy grammar, but you get the point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Adawen</div><div class="date">10-13-03, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like a reasonable idea to me, especially if you have a cleric sitting around and not a mage.  And if you do have to PL the cleric to 46, it's not a big deal as other have mentioned.<br />
<br />
Also, the magician losing xp is a moot point.  Magician could easily be duelled.  Or could take xp death, get real 96% res, then get dragged again and reres the already ressed corpse.<br />

<br />
On that note, what's this I hear about a level 46 requirement for ToV? I could have sworn I've seen/been in there at a lower level than that, but I don't remember specifically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_jocke98</div><div class="date">10-13-03, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ToV is required level 46. if you are 1-45 you get dumped to the &quot;safe spot&quot; a bit outside SG zonein. Not particulary &quot;safe&quot; at all if you are kos  <br />

<br />
Interesting... I don't know for sure if there is or isn't a level limit to enter VT, but I thought the loot itself now carried a L55 requirement. No?</div></div><hr />

took like a weekend to get the cleric keyed w/ the combined effort of a few members of the guild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_murgatroyde</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it was the first day they activated the keyring feature, there was a bug where once you put a key on the keyring (by zoning), any character on the account could zone in.  A friend tried and got lvl 11 chanter (think that was the char) into VT.  So I know there wasn't a level limit at that point.  Probably doesn't need to be one, given the difficulty of getting keyed.<br />
<br />
I think zone level limits were first put in during the era of the Fear opening, when people would make level 1 Ogres and kamikaze run them into Fear to ninja or loot rots.  Only took a little navigation and a couple minutes to get the chars in zone.  Takes a fair bit more with VT.<br />
<br />
I've got a lvl 21 wizard with a rift from one of the Gatekeepers we got on our early kills - though I have zero intention of ever getting him shards.</div></div><hr />

Now that I think about it, I think my TVK earring is L60 recommended, but I could've sworn my TVK pants are L55 required. Oh well, no way to check until I can get back in-game. Thanks for the response. :)</div></div><hr />
