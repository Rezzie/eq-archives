<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legna</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So here I am. Finally level 8, and going along (mostly alone due to never finding any redeemed on) when every contact only has one mission for me. Go talk to the security chief for Perez Park.<br />
<br />
I have avoided the mission for a long time. I went to Perez Park once and was quickly destroyed by entire mobs of mobs. Never see less than 5 together (which to a solo scrapper means dead). <br />
<br />
So I go and talk to him, and of course, he sends me straight into the park. I am a tech scrapper, so naturally the enemy he chooses for me is circle of thorns. I zone in, see Hellions by the hundreds, clockworks galore, and just sort of run the length of the wall. <br />
<br />
Everything I see is at least level 7, but most of them in the teens. Every group I find say that you can find the circle mobs anywhere, but apparently someone called ahead and told them to hide. <br />
<br />
Running through the forest, through tunnels in a swamp area. Nothing but hydras and clockworks that are all upper teens. <br />
<br />
Why in the hell would a person who is alone and level 7 get sent into that insane zone as their only mission option? The zone is clearly well out of my league for at least 2 more levels. Everyone said get a group, but I didn't see any groups my level running around.<br />
<br />
Bleh, now I am stuck on a mission I will probably not be able to finish for two levels. That means 2 more levels of roaming kings row without a mission, leveling slowly by killing purse snatchers.<br />
<br />
Least they could have done was given me a tech enemy. Pretty far in the drug arc, and the clockwork arc. Bleh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the infamous Perez Park mission specifically exists to encourage players to group after gaining a few levels, because that's the only way to manage it at the time you get it.<br />
<br />
It's pretty annoying ain't it? But at least once you take it from one contact, your other contacts start offering you other jobs again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stick near the gates to the park, CoT will spawn eventually and usually in manageable groups. I solo'd that mission at 8 without too much trouble.<br />
<br />
Or you could try grouping, but it's rough as a scrapper if you don't have a healer that's on the ball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legna</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't get me wrong. It isn't that I have an aversion to grouping. Actually I have done it a couple times and had a complete blast each time.<br />
<br />
I am wary about grouping with people I don't know. I will usually break down eventually and give it a shot, but I prefer it to be with people I at least partially know.<br />
<br />
I would have joined any of the groups that I had found earlier, but they were all well above my level. Although that by itself isn't too bad, demanding they move to an area for my mission from where they are comfortably hunting already seems kind of silly. I just took the death, went to the hospital and will do something tonight to remedy it I hope.<br />
<br />
Thinking about re-rolling anyhow, fixing my name a little, and making my costume better.. again. Plus it would give me more time to track down some of you out there to group with.<br />
<br />
Haven't decided yet, but definitely starting to lean that way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I grouped up my level 12 mind/storm controller wtih a scrapper and we were a terrific duo.  While my heals aren't that great, my ability to slow and mez things works well at preventing damage.<br />
<br />
I've had pretty good luck just approaching random people who are soloing and asking them if they'd like to team up for a bit.   I have gotten a few bad ones, but as often as not it works and is a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it's a pain mission.  If you read the contact screen when he gives it to you, you'll see that he tells you to get friends for this mission.  They just want to make you group.  Annoying.<br />
<br />
I've received that mission on both my main and my alt.  Each time I just ran to the park, via Atlas City I think, and got a quick pickup group.  Last time we encountered a group of 10 CoT right away, killed them, and I was done.  <br />
<br />
Wait till later when you have a chance of getting an underground mission which has an entrance located deep in the maze of the park, and you have to run through it alone to find it.  That was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've only grouped with strangers a few times, and it was invariably a debt factory. I've rolled up an empathy defender to give it another try- low-level scrappers may just not be group-friendly.<br />
<br />
Of course, I doubt groups will be too happy with a healer that crashes every ten minutes  :beatup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uhm, you do know that you can have up to THREE missions at any time? You aren't stuck to leveling outside of missions because of that one Perez Park mission.<br />
<br />
Oh, and CoT is mostly inside the woods in Perez, you won't find them out in the open - sunlight is baaaaaaaaad. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-26-04, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, they are in alot of places out in the open, but usually in HUGE groups.  Your best bet is to enter from the east side of the park, avoid the large gangs and get into the woods and head northward into the Bettis Hills part of the woods.  In the woods the groups are usually smaller.  And if your lucky you'll find a pack thats not that high a level.<br />
<br />
though, I just got 2 other people together doing the same mission and we all three were done in 2 packs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-26-04, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been in a group where every single person had that mission, all 7 or 8 of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legna</div><div class="date">05-28-04, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got into a group for this last night. Went pretty fast and only a couple deaths from the exciting exploding mages. Luckily I was not one of them. <br />
<br />
I really can't even explain how much fun I have with the large fights that often happen when grouping. Total chaos and blinding flashes constantly bombarding me.<br />
<br />
I still don't really like that this mission is there, but in the end I guess it isnt SO bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuurus</div><div class="date">06-13-04, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did this mission as a solo lvl 8 scrapper by rushing into a group of 8 to 10 of them, killing about 3 or 4 of them, then when my health got low, sprinting away to rest up for a minute.  Rinse and repeat.  Took 3 attacks on large groups of them to kill the required 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">06-13-04, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did this mission as a solo lvl 8 scrapper by rushing into a group of 8 to 10 of them, killing about 3 or 4 of them, then when my health got low, sprinting away to rest up for a minute.

<br />
I did the same as a tank.<br />
<br />
As a controller I got a bit smarter.  I just hit the find members button and pick out a defender and a tank that both had tolerable names e.g. not Phil MaCrotch or Uzumaki Naruto.  You'd think a defender with Dr. in the name would be empath but apparently you'd be wrong.  The good doctor however was well specced in FF and the tank was invul/mace so no problems were had.<br />
<br />
The moral of the story is, when you run the group you're less likely to meet idiots, and infinately more likely to get rid of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">06-13-04, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">even at level 19 I'm having some issues with missions... particularly frontloaded ones.<br />
<br />
I bust into a mission, groups of 5-6 level 20s, staring down at my 19 butt. Get a friend to help me dispatch these, they drop to 19, he leaves. I'm fine then, but I hate not being able to solo the start of the mission, and then being able to shred the end (level 16's.) non stop.<br />
<br />
I really, really dislike frontloaded missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-13-04, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got stuck with the &quot;Capture the Jewel Thieves&quot; mission, which is convienently located DIRECTLY in the middle of the red zone in Perez.<br />
So I go to Perez. Finding groups proves incredibly easy. Getting them to do the mission is nigh ****ing impossible. Everyone keeps saying &quot;If it's in a cave, you can **** off, I won't do it&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">06-13-04, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's one of the things I like about stealth; on frontload missions I can usually kill some of the hard villians at the entrance using the inspirations I have on me, sneak past the rest and kill the easier villians in the middle, then use the inspirations gained from the easier kills to clear the rest of the hard guys at the entrance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">06-14-04, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't mind front-loaded missions with my scrapper because the door is right there to escape if I need it.  I'd much rather have one of those, which will yield an easy boss, than one with a purple boss that I suddenly might have to find help for.  <br />
<br />
What I DO hate about front-loaded missions are all the grey mobs at the end.  I mean come on, GREY?  At least give me a mix of greens and blues so I can get some experience for the mindless killing i'm doing.  There's nothing worse than running out of endurance on greys and having like 25 more to kill.</div></div><hr />
