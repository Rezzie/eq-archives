<br />
Quote:(Orange, California-AP) -- Three 12-year-old California girls have been sentenced to serve from 30 to 45 days' detention for falsely accusing a homeless man of attacking them. <br />
<br />
The lie kept Eric Nordmark in jail for eight months.  <br />
<br />
Yesterday, the Orange County girls all admitted to conspiracy. One also admitted committing perjury. Two received 45 days of detention, with the third receiving a month. They were already in custody and received 25 days' credit for time served. <br />
<br />
Each girl must perform 60 hours of community service, pay unspecified restitution and remain on probation until age 21. <br />
<br />
Nordmark was arrested last May and charged with attacking the girls in a suburban park. His trial ended abruptly in January after one girl admitted the three friends concocted the story as a cover for coming home late from school.<br />
<br />
<br />
That would suck to be stuck in jail just because someone didn't want to get in trouble for coming home late.</div></div><hr />

Todays word for the day is &quot;Contingency&quot;<br />
<br />
If there is a case that will undoubtedly result in a significant amount of monetary compensation, the &quot;Contingency&quot; Lawyers will line up around the block to take the case.. Especially in California.<br />
<br />
Any Good ambulance chaser worth his salt would be all over this. Ask Lisboa, I am sure he could fill ya in..</div></div><hr />

You actually get charged for your time in jail. (My best friends girlfriend works for the DA) <br />
<br />
So unfortunately, he got jail time, and is going to get a bill for it.. IMO, they should recieve that bill along with thier hardcore 60 hours of community service.</div></div><hr />
