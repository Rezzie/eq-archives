<br />
39 +11 envenom skill will allow a person to use the lvl 50 poisons?<br />
<br />
or is that the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sljivarion</div><div class="date">03-20-02, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But can't you see the difference???  Safe fall level, along with weapons styles, is something that is given to your character once and your character retains the ability.  That is why +skill items dont give you the abilities, since you cannot gain an ability just to lose later when you remove the item.<br />
<br />
Evenom, on the other hand, is not an ability that is printed in your character stats screen or something that is given to you in styles or spells list.  It is the number that is checked against the level of a poison every time you try to apply the poison.  Hence +evenom items let you use higher level poisons.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one seeing this clear distinction?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aunoa Pyrotechnica</div><div class="date">03-21-02, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just discovered The Safehouse forum.  This thread really helped me understand a few things that were bugging me. I kept wondering why I didn't get PA when my Crit was at 21. Of course my base skill was still at 19 and item bonuses took me to 21.<br />
<br />
So, now that I understand that concept another question comes to mind.  What benefit do item bonuses offer? Edited by: Aunoa Pyrotechnica  at: 3/21/02 1:15:47 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kehvrynne</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While item and Realm Point bonuses don't grant the styles associated with a given level of training, they DO increase your effective score for other calculations.<br />
<br />
Take weapon skill.  Let's say you have a trained Pierce score of 19, but have +4 Pierce due to items and/or Realm Point bonuses.  You won't be able to perform the Copperhead attack style, since your trainer hasn't taught it to you (and won't until you train Pierce to 21).  However, for purposes of damage calculation your effective Pierce skill is 23.  <br />
<br />
Same applies to Critical Strike (damage multiplier only), Stealth, etc. Kehvrynne Quickblade, Professional Damsel of Distress<br />
No matter how subtle the wizard, a dirk between the shoulder blades will seriously cramp his style.</div></div><hr />
