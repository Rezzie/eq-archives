Many Thanks to Jaax the infiltrator on Lancelot for the envenom skill, the idea to test it, and for supplying the poisons. <br />
<br />
Ya can thank me for being the lab rat if ya want ~*Grins*~ <br />
<br />
So, I was really curious about the poisons, specifically the snare as I need that slow for my second hit. We spent some time tonight doing some very extensive tests. Unfortunately, we couldn't test this with the buffs to see how much of an effect it has. Supposedly, they debuff a higher -&gt;percentage&amp;lt;- against a buffed opponent. While still having more total hitpoints if buffed before the enervating. <br />

<br />
We began with the DOT poisons. <br />
<br />
*15 Spec Major Lethal Poison: <br />
19, 18, 22, 18, 20 On the first round <br />
21, 22, 21, 22, 22 On the second round <br />
<br />
*20 Spec Greater Lethal Poison <br />
22, 25, 23, 25, 25 <br />
25, 27, 22, 26, 22 <br />
<br />
*25 Spec Minor Lethal Venom <br />
27, 29, 30, 25, 30 <br />
25, 25, 27, 28, 28 <br />
<br />
<br />
-So it looks like the poison was doing from 2-6 more damage than is stated with Shift-I. Most likely due to the higher level he was. <br />
<br />
---------- <br />
<br />
We then tried the Str Debuff Line. Each was tested twice with the exact same results each time. We also tested the enervatings with and without gear. Even when I was down to my base stats, they still took away the Exact same amount of Str/Con. <br />
<br />
*17 Spec Greater Weakening Poison <br />
-24 Str. (101 from 125) <br />
-44 Weaponskill (465 from 509) <br />
As a Str based Sword user, that 24 Str took away 44 weaponskill. Something important to those of us attacking tanks and other Str Weapon users. <br />
<br />
*22 Spec Minor Enervating Poison <br />
-31 Str (94 from 125) <br />
-31 Con (72 from 103) <br />
-84 Hitpoints (657 from 741) <br />
-56 Weaponskill (453 from 509) <br />
When we tested this with my base stats alone. (Nothing Equipped) I still lost the same 31 Str/Con. I still only lost 84 Hitpoints. <br />
<br />
*29 Spec Lesser Enervating Poison <br />
-40 Str (85 from 125) <br />
-40 Con (63 from 103) <br />
-108 HPs (633 from 741) <br />
-75 Weaponskill (434 from 509) <br />
<br />
<br />
Definitely a HUGE nerf on these. Hopefully Mythic will change these back. They do not even debuff what the Shift-I says they do. Not even against a target 3 levels lower. <br />
<br />
------------ <br />
<br />
Next we went to the Infectious Serum, these were very interesting to say the least. The snare numbers are what we both agreed to as right. We ran alongside each other after each hit. The Snare does NOT break from hits, or from bleed/dot Damage. We couldnt test the healing part of it, but I am sure it is a 50% reduction in heals Like it has been stated. <br />
<br />
*16 Spec Lesser Infectious Serum <br />
-7 Str (118 from 125) <br />
15% Snare <br />
Lasts 1 minute <br />
<br />
*26 Infectious Serum <br />
-10 Str <br />
25% Snare <br />
Lasts 1 minute <br />
<br />
Now there was definitely around a 10% decrease in speed between the two poisons. These I believe are some of our better poisons. Noone can outrun you, and it lasts a minute Regardless. <br />
<br />
--------- <br />
<br />
We then tried the Snares. These I were most interested in as a 2 handed Sword user. To keep them within range for my creeping death to land. The Snare percentage was what we both agreed on. On all of these he ran after me in stealth, and stayed step for stealth with me. He has 40 Stealth at level 41. <br />
<br />
*Spec Level 13 Major Imbalacne Poison <br />
40% Snare (Exact same speed as a near full stealth assassin- 40 Stealth at level 41) <br />
52 Second Duration (Same as stated with Shift-I, as were all the snares) <br />
<br />
*Spec Level 18 Greater Imbalance Poison <br />
40% Snare <br />
1 Minute Duration <br />
<br />
*Spec Level 23 Minor Crippling Poison <br />
40% snare <br />
<br />
*Spec Level 27 Lesser Crippling poison <br />
40% snare <br />
<br />
Now, all of these slowed me the exact same amount. Each time he was step for step with me in stealth mode. The only change was in the duration. <br />
Interestingly, we wanted to try to see just what broke this snare. <br />
----Another hit will break the snare (will still show icon above until duration is over, but you are not slowed in anyway) <br />
----Poison breaks the snare <br />
We tested this with him using only one weapon. He hit me with a Dot, then hit me with the snare. The snare slowed me until the next tick of the dot. <br />
----Bleed damage Breaks the snare <br />
We tested this using a anytime bleed move he had called Puncture. I was slowed only until the SECOND tick of the bleed. <br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------- <br />
<br />
We tested each poison twice. I resisted one out of all of those. <br />
<br />
Thats what we saw. I got the two answers I so ardently desired. <br />
<br />
First, Yes, the Enervating line was weakened by over 150%. This is without buffs. Mythic needs to change our poisons back. We dont have the spec points to spend on poisons that debuff the same as 1 melee swing without a style. <br />
<br />
Second, Yes, I can use my 5.5 Delay two hander and expect to get a snare in and land my second hit for sure. I tested the time between the Perforate and the second tick of the bleed damage. It ranged from 4.8 to 5.0 Seconds (Human error I'm sure ~*Grins*~). That is more than enough time to get in my second swing after my quick is taken into account. Also, since the snares all slowed the exact same amount, I only need to raise envenom high enough to use the spec level 3 snare. 40% movement reduction is HUGE and I only need a 5 second duration on it. <br />
<br />
I am most impressed with the infectious serums snare. Couple that with a DOT for non melee types. Couple it with an enervating for Str Weapon users for the weapon skill lowering. Thats what I would use was I going for envenom.. <br />
<br />
I sincerely hope this helps everyone out. We had a good time testing this. <br />
