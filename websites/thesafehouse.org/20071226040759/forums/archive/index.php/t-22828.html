I was wrong. I'm trying to figure out WTF Azuma is going to do with that french bread and a garbage bag. I swear, he's like the Mcguyver of baking, only with way less common sense.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Oh...  ...and anyone else totally not buy Kanmuri being male? I don't care if he really is, but dear jeebus he looks, talks, acts, dresses like a girl... he even has freakin' Pink hair! And I don't mean he dresses fruity in a 'queer eye' sense, I mean he dresses like a girl in a 'yup, that's a girl' sense. I find it odd that nobody in the series has addressed this.</div></div><hr />

I heard it was good from a certain contact which I contacted. I forget, was it a comedy? Maybe I should check it out..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its like.. A sports bread making anime. Extreme breadmaking manuvers, legendary bread indegrents, samurai breadmakers, etc.<br />
<br />
Its funny as hell. The reactions are pee my pants funny. Sports fans will enjoy the parody, everyone else will enjoy the comedy.</div></div><hr />

ROFL.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
I havent laughed this hard at a scene in an anime in a long time. When Kuro went SSJ I allmost fell out of my chair, I was laughing so hard.<br />
 <br />
And it solves the mystery of the terrible Kawachi bread!</div></div><hr />

Said it before, and I'll say it again:<br />

I NEVER watch previews. What's the point in knowing what's going to happen?</div></div><hr />

Well its not like they show ya everything but i guess if your good at puting things together then ya :P.<br />

And now I will have to DL all of em =/.</div></div><hr />

You have no idea. If something catches me by suprise, and it wasn't cheap (i.e. no basis whatsoever- a good guy turning bad with no lead-up, no signs, just making it happen for 'shock value' and not giving a reason that meshes with the actions or information given of the person up to that point), then I know it was extremely well-written.<br />
 <br />
Which is why I hate it when shows make a new opening, and show you characters or situations that haven't happened yet. It ruins any sort of suprise or shock, and gives me far too much insight as to ways a situation might be resolved.<br />
 <br />
Quite literally, I have to make myself as ignorant as possible about something to enjoy it nowadays. Any research into a story, no matter how slight, usually ends up ruining some dramatic part.</div></div><hr />

Oh ****, I hope I didn't spoil you on KimiNozo then!!<br />

*edit* I also don't watch previews, but I saw a picture on 4chan so I figured since I saw the pic, I may as well watch it.</div></div><hr />

I know exactly what you mean, I once went to a One Piece forum that didn't have very strict anti-spoiler moderation and in 30 seconds I got spoiled more from people's sigs then I did in years on the rest of the intraweb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never watch previews unless it different that what is actually going to happen.<br />
I figure why watch a short synopsis of the next episode that im going to watch as soon as I click the next button anyway.<br />
<br />
On occasion I watch the last preview on a DVD if im sitting on the edge of my seat as to what is going to happen in the next episode.</div></div><hr />

The characters are in a jam!<br />
 <br />
 <br />
lol, I made a funny. And Hooray for all the Kid sightings. I dunno how they are going to win tho, they have one hell of a lopsided match. I'm wondering if azuma, in his sick state, can come up with something involving jam, when his specialty is bread.</div></div><hr />

nori nori nori (Isn't that a DDR song?)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Man, that dude is goofy as hell. I swear Kawachi kept saying 'bankai' right before he turned into Pepsi-man :tinfoil <br />
<br />
 <br />
..am I the only person watching this? I am sad about that.</div></div><hr />

I thought 63 was hilarious. Btw, the series ends at 69 if you didn't know. Honestly, they feel like they are getting repetitive now, anyway. Too bad. I haven't really been enjoying hte last few episodes like I have the first 52.</div></div><hr />

Owned. You knew it was going to happen tho, especially when Azuma went first. He NEVER goes first. Now, of they take the panels like they were planning, the Pantasia crew is pretty screwed.</div></div><hr />

FINALLY, some fanservice! We got to see her in a swimsuit, sexy. She was totally forgotten :(<br />
<br />
As for the episode itself, Kuro's second reaction was funny. I thought the first one was dull.</div></div><hr />

I totally thought Kuro's second reaction was gonna be a parody of Ringu at first. Creepy!<br />
 <br />
*SING IT WITH ME*<br />
panda panda panda panda panda panda panda panda ja-pan ja-pan!</div></div><hr />

Wow, talk about an epic reaction. Tho I said to myself when the loquat seller was introduced 'wow, he kinda looks like gollum'. Foresight FTW!<br />
 <br />
And Tsukino was kinda hot as Arwen.... :rofl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">06-09-06, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Final episode<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Well, that was rushed. It's like they skipped an episode, then left it wide-open at the end. /sigh<br />
<br />
 <br />
Was fun while it lasted!</div></div><hr />
