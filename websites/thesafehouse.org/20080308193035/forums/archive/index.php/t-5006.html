<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_FaceDude</div><div class="date">04-01-02, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a few questions that I was hoping to get some friendly direction on Infiltrators for the mid 20ish lvls.  Any information that you folks good provide is really appreciated.  Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
1.  For 24-30, what is the armor that most of you wear or wore?  Bloodied Leather?  Observer?  From what I've noticed most of this is extremely rare.<br />
<br />
2.  What off hand thrust weapons do you or did you use for this levle range?  Main hand of course is embossed bone gladius.<br />
<br />
3.  What skill break down did you train in or what advice could you offer for this area?  Currently, I'm at 21+3 stealth, 21+1 CS.  14+3 thrust, 8 DW, and I can use Major lethal poison.  Currently, I'm at lvl 24.  <br />
<br />
Again, thanks in advance for any input you can provide   <br />
<br />

<br />
for weapons I used dual crafted stilettos. When you turn 30 get a friend and do the long loin fang quest. AWESOME dirks.<br />
<br />
keep weapon skill at at least 2/3ds your level. I personally keep mine at 80% my level and love it. Everything else is up to your style.</div></div><hr />
