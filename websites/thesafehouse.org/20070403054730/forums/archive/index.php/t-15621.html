You can also get locked junkboxes off of mobs through pickpocketing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My lockpicking skill was 115 when they stopped making it autoskillup with that patch a week ago. It took me a while to find the right mob level relative to mine to PP locked boxes i could skill up from.  I tried orcs in Wetlands at level 30, but all those boxes were grey to me. Today, at level 35, i went to Alterac Mountains (north of Hillsbrad/Southshore) and pickpocketed the level 34-36 Defias up there.  I scored a locked box that was actually Yellow-con to me! Quite exciting. It gave me a skill up!<br />
<br />
I visited the site in Redridge that had the Alliance practice lock boxes in it yesterday.  I hadn't really done the quest for it properly since when i was that level, i already had maxxed lockpicking skill for my level so i could just loot the real box and leave.<br />
<br />
There were two rogues there skilling up. One had started there at skill 1 and was already up to 50 or so on the practice ones... apparently you practice on those until you attain enough skill to open the &quot;real&quot; locked box that contains the level 14 rogue quest item. I had 115 skill and all the boxes were grey to me.  <br />
<br />
I'm also an engineer, so i made up some Practice Locks for myself to try them, thinking hey, if i made them, maybe they'll be level appropriate for me. Wrong. :p  I think they top out at skill 75 or so... they were grey-con to me at skill level 115.  Ah well.</div></div><hr />

I stationed myself between 3 boxes and began to alternate between them.  Took me only like 8 minutes to get my skill to 80, then it slowed down pretty good.  Funniest thing was a dwarf who ran into the room right as I sprang a trap that turned us both to mice.  Unfortunately for him he was being chased by a giant spider.</div></div><hr />

Where exactly are we supposed to get skill ups past the initial training spot?  Just off found lock boxes and engineered practice locks?  Please tell me there is more...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">12-14-04, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can skill up to around 170 off the box in the rogue poison quest tower, if you don't mind handling a 25th elite mob every now and again.<br />
<br />
Around 150-160 or so, you can get increases off the workshop door in Gnomeregon, but it's green to me at the moment.<br />
<br />
I'm having problems with lockpicking now. I've found 3 boxes that are red to me at 175-ish lockpicking. I have no idea when they'll turn orange, and I don't know where to get boxes that will raise my skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">12-14-04, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard you can do the doors in Scarlet Monostary up pretty high, but they are a bit wonky, some kind of wierd reseting or something.  <br />
<br />
Which door is the workshop door in Gnomeregan?  Is that the one with Thermaplugg on the other side?  If so do I have to run to the bottom of the instace for each skill up, or can i close it and reopen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">12-14-04, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it's outside the instance.<br />
<br />
There is a door back near where Techbot is that is like a back door into the instance. You can pick it, and if you want, you can sneak into the instance, and pick the other side of it down near where the crowd-pummler spawns.<br />
<br />
Then you can get back out, and camp to reset.<br />
<br />
It's green to me now at 175 though. I still get skill increases semi-regularly, but it takes a long time to reset for skill increases (If you just sit there and try and pick it, you'll only see increases on the first attempt I think).<br />
<br />
Also, Scarlet Monestary doors are still red to me at 175 lockpicking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I may be wrong about the Scarlet Monestary doors. I wasn't quite at 175 yet. Hit it last night, and all of the boxes I'd been holding on to went orange.<br />
<br />
So I'm thinking that 175 looks like the target number for sturdy junkboxes and steel lockboxes.<br />
<br />
If everyone can try and compile a list of at what skill various items become orange, it would probably help all of us.<br />

However, if you click on lockpick, and put it over the chest, the chest becomes a lockpickable item.<br />

You will get the touch of Zanzil on you, but if you have any Jungle Remedy, you can just kill it when you're finished.</div></div><hr />

Don't feel too bad.<br />

I was sitting there, picking the box, and occasionally killing the guy that spawned next to me. One time, when I was fighting him, some paladin comes up there stairs (26th pal), and starts calling me names for fighting the guy. Then he stuck arround and harrassed me until the guy re-popped.<br />
<br />
I vanished, and let him fight it solo. He died, I finished the named off, and went back to picking the lock.</div></div><hr />

I got 2 skill ups off the Redridge box.  This is what i found.  It seemed to only give no-consecutive skill ups, i did get 2 off it, but it went like this.<br />
<br />
Skill up on Quest box<br />
Skill up on Practice Box<br />
Skill up on Quest box<br />
<br />
I gave up after that cuz i had to log.<br />
<br />
The box was yellow to me at 100 (Someone said green at 100, but i saw yellow)  It was still orange to me at like 90+.<br />
<br />
I'll test it a bit more.  it might be like the gnomergan (sp) doors that require you to zone/log to get skillups. <br />

But the quest box is certainly higher level then the practice boxes.</div></div><hr />

Hi, since it's been asked so many times I was hoping to compile a list of what items require what skill in lockpick and when they become trivial. This is still not complete, I NEED input from everyone. Hopefully this helps everyone, once more, I need more input to make this complete!<br />
<br />
As a note:<br />
YOU DO NOT GET SKILLUPS FROM LOCKPICKING OTHER PEOPLE'S BOXES ON THE &quot;WILL NOT BE TRADED SLOT&quot;<br />
<br />
Pickpocketted stuff: (To find out which mobs give what from PP: www.thottbot.com)<br />
Battered Junkbox (Orange: 25? Trivial: 100?)<br />
Worn Junkbox (Orange: 100? Trivial: 175)<br />
Sturdy Junkbox (orange: 175 Trivial: 250?)<br />
Heavy Junkbox (Orange: 250 Trivial: never?)<br />
<br />
Heavy Bronze Lockbox<br />
Ornate Bronze Lockbox<br />
Iron Lockbox (Orange: 80? Trivial:???)<br />
Strong Iron Lockbox (Orange: 130)<br />
Steel Lockbox (orange: 175 trivial: ???)<br />

Eternium Lockbox<br />
<br />
Doors:<br />
Gnomeregan (Orange: 150? Green: 200)<br />
Scarlet Monastery (Orange: 185 Green: 226 Trivial:???)<br />
(see notes 3)<br />
Searing Gorge Gate (~225-230 skill) (2 guaranteed skill ups, but on timers.)<br />
BRD (Orange: 280 Trivial: hah.)<br />
Scholoman (Orange: 280 Trivial: good joke.)<br />
<br />
Other Stuff:<br />
Insta-chests from respective lockpicking quests (orange: 1 trivial: 105)<br />
Main chest in lockpicking quest (orange: 75/80? trivial: 175)<br />
Klaven's tower chest (orange: 90 trivial: 175) (see 1 below in notes section)<br />
Engineered Practice Locks (Green: 1 Trivial: 75) (You can only pick these ONCE, so they are WORTHLESS)<br />
<br />
Links for lockpicking quests with respective insta-chests:<br />
Alliance: http://thottbot.com/?q=1165<br />
Horde: http://thottbot.com/?q=799<br />
<br />
Quick theoretical notes NOT TESTED: (Need confirmation on this)<br />
<br />
Confirmed Lockpicking Information: (READ THIS)<br />
1. When you want to pick lock a door, if you PP a junkbox between successes (not just skillups) at the door, it will allow multiple skillups at the door. (ie. pick door (get it open), pick junkbox (skillup/noskillup), pick door(possible skillup again).) (this is very useful in scarlet monastery)<br />
<br />
2.<br />
<br />
Quick lockpick skillup guide:<br />
(or how Melgrave got so high on Lockpicking and Laenis copy/pasted his guide and modified it =P)<br />
NOTE: You get the Pick Lock skill at level 16 from a rogue trainer high enough to give it. You get 5 points of lockpicking per level. (ie. 225 lockpicking is achieved when you hit level 45)<br />
<br />
1-103 on the Insta-chests from lockpicking quest.<br />
<br />
I recomend running through a &quot;private&quot; Stockades instance when level 30 or so (less with MoD) and PPing 2 bags full of lockboxes.<br />
<br />
103-175 very tediously between pickpocketted lockboxes and Klaven's tower.<br />
<br />
Desolace is good at late 30s for the undead ravagers also drop mageweave (yummy!)<br />
<br />
175-178 on the Gnomeregan doors (I suggest you learn how to reset an instance, see notes 2)<br />
<br />
179-184 on Scarlet Monastery doors/chests<br />
<br />
Haunted recomends that at 175 skill, the best thing to do is wait until you're level 45-50 and pickpocket either the ogres in Tanaris while grinding, or pickpocket Zul'Farrak and resetting the instance (about 5-6 junkboxes per run average.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
1. I just did this at 39, go to Westfall to where the poison quest is at, top floor, Klaven can take me down to half health at 39 if I don't dual-ambush so he kinda hurts. Hopefully you can also be outside his aggro range to practice. To do this just go behind his table, there should be two chairs, jump over the chair closest to the chest and from behind the chair pick the lock (you MUST click on your lockpicking icon then the chest). Don't worry about Touch of Zanzil, a death(*) or Jungle Remedy from STV or cure poison from a high enough player should make it all good.<br />
You must be of a high enough level not to aggro Klaven!<br />
*: for extra points see how many mobs you can pull and tank at the same time in Westfall without dying or killing any, my record is 25 (without using evasion)<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Easiest way to reset an instance is to have a buddy help you:<br />
Enter instance solo.<br />
Invite buddy to group.<br />
*BIG CAP WARNING* ***DANGER*** ***ALERT*** ****TOLD YOU SO**** DO NOT LEAVE GROUP BEFORE LEAVING INSTANCE, THIS WILL BUG YOUR INSTANCE AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WALK BACK IN FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.<br />
Once you're done doing your dirty deeds with sheep in the instance, leave the instance while grouped.<br />
Once outside, leave the group and re-enter solo.<br />
Lather.<br />
Rinse.<br />
Repeat.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. You can skill up 8 times on the doors to SM, there are 4 doors, 2 inside instances and 2 outside. They can be picked from both directions though so each count as 2.<br />
(SEE INFORMATION 1 ABOVE)<br />
Library: Chest in a cubby before the Gallery of Treasures, guarded by 3 mobs. Another chest that spawns in one of the hallways close to Doan himself, guarded by typically 2 mobs + one roamer.<br />
<br />
Armory: Chest either in the Training Grounds (guarded by 2 mobs + 1 roamer) or inside the first part of the armory (guarded by 2 mobs + 1 roamer.) Can't remember location of other chest off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Cathedral: Chest on either the left or right side of the fountain. Another chest that spawns either by the monk guarding Fairbanks' hiding spot, or spawns on the other side of the cathedral (guarded by 3 mobs + 2 that roam close but may or may not aggro.)</div></div><hr />

That would be pretty high level, since he was still agroing me at 40. :P  Just high enough to kill him every 8 minutes or whatever it takes him to spawn.</div></div><hr />

Just head to the north western part of Stranglethorn, where there are three sets of ruins full of Bloodscalps, ranging from around 33 up to the high 30s, with two boss types at 40 and 41.  You can avoid anything higher than 37 by not going up the ramp to the top level at the northwestern part of the large ruins.<br />

Just wander around picking pockets.  You can clean em all out in about 15 minutes, and get around 10-20 worn junkboxes each run, depending on your luck.  I just do it about once per day, since I'm too lazy to kill the things.  I started doing it at 39 and had no trouble.  At 42 even the bosses don't spot me when I'm sneaking around.<br />
<br />
The worn junkboxes can take you up to 175, the skill necessary to open sturdys and steel.  Also, with each run you'll make about 1g in coin, usually get around 5 greater healing potions, a few gems (I usually get 2-3 citrines, something the guild smith is always pleased about), plenty of pocket watches for another 25-30s, and occasionally some nice recipes or items.  Last two runs I found smithing plans for reasonably high end weapons (200 and 225 skill, I thnk) in some of the junk boxes, made 3.5g for the two.</div></div><hr />

It turns green at 125, the skillups slow down quite a bit at 150, and 174-175 took me almost a whole spawn cycle to get. Klaven has about an 8 minute timer, times the 10 second timer on the chest, that's quite a few picks for 2 skillups...</div></div><hr />

<br />
then my friend &quot;came to help&quot; (he had killed me because I had gotten caught on a respawn.) and nearly killed my friend while I hid and laughed :D. He is nasty.<br />

Antivenom also cures zanzil! I found that out when I first got it.</div></div><hr />

He killed me at 36 once because the lag wouldent let me swing my specials to often.  (This was before I figured out the lag fighting tatics)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pikks</div><div class="date">01-18-05, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lockpicking is a real joke. I fight humanoids 75 % of the time and always pickpocket them and I still outlevel my lock pick skill. Im level 52 and pickpocketing heavy junkboxes now and my skill is just 226. I have 24 more points to find before I can open these. So now I have to farm 45ish mobs for sturdy junkboxes. Im going to get accused of being a farmer just trying to raise this stupid skill.</div></div><hr />

My lockpick is now 145/145.  I have been wandering about trying to visit rogue npc, tainer etc to see how I can go further.  I am 29 atm and seemed to be capped at 145 skill.  Who do I need to visit to train more to have the ability to raise it further?<br />

<br />
As a note:<br />
YOU DO NOT GET SKILLUPS FROM LOCKPICKING OTHER PEOPLE'S BOXES ON THE &quot;WILL NOT BE TRADED SLOT&quot;<br />
<br />
That was fixed with a patch a while ago, just for future reference. You can indeed get skillups from the no-trade slot now.</div></div><hr />
