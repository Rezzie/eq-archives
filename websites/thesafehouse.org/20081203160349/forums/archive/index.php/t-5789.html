 Major PvP Server Changes Announced for Next Patch<br />
Ksian [5/4/2001-5:23:58 PM]  Comments[13] <br />
<br />
Absor making some pre-patch announcements dealing with some big changes for the PvP servers: <br />
<br />
When we patch next, the following changes will be implemented on the PvP servers:<br />
<br />
Consider: /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character. The character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him. The character will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack. And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range.<br />
<br />
Sanctuary Levels: Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.<br />
<br />
De-Leveling: Characters that lose levels will only retain the skills of a character two levels higher. This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character. This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise). So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.<br />
<br />
You can view the entire thread here. Please note that Absor does specify that these changes regarding &quot;consider&quot; and &quot;sanctuary levels&quot; are due to only take place on the PvP servers, whereas the changes due to de-leveling will apply Gamewide.</div></div><hr />
