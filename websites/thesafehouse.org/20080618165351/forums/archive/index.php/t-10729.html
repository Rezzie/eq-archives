<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">06-06-04, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">June 4-6, 2004 Sony Online Entertainment invited over 60 players to a &quot;Guild Summit&quot; to give direct feedback about the current state of EverQuest and players' disapointment with the Gates of Discord expansion. Attendees were mainly guild leaders or their appointed officers plus representatives from player class and fan sites. A sampling of guilds included: Legacy of Steel, Township Rebellion, Triton, Silent Redemption, Cats in Hats, BotS, LoS, and other large guilds as well as some mid range guilds. Class and fan sites included The Safehouse, Druid's Grove, Steel Warrior, Shaman's Crucible, Berserker.com, EQTraders, GU comics, EQmac, Mobhunter and The Runes.net.<br />
<br />
The weekend's structure included a tour of the SOE offices and group discussions throughout saturday with designers, developers, producers, and customer service, with some time to speak to the same folks individually during the lunch break. The evening ended with a dinner at a San Diego restaurant and attendees departed throughout the day Sunday.<br />
<br />
I literally just got home so this report will be ongoing. Pictures, movies and much more detail will be added shortly.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, here is the letter passed out at dinner Saturday compiled from information discussed during the panels.<br />
<br />
June 5, 2004<br />
<br />
Dear Guild and Community Representatives,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for a great Summit! By all accounts it was a huge success. I can speak for the EverQuest Development Team and tell you that we're grateful for the input you provided. In fact, in trying to generate this list to give to you this evening, we realized there was so much to go over that wouldn't be able to get a complete list together in time. We're committed to not only listening to your feedback, but working with you to make EverQuest more enjoyable for years to come.<br />
<br />
So, we decided to list the Top Ten themes we would address starting Monday, as well as the most common themes that we'll come back with more information by mid-week next week.<br />
<br />
A quick discussion resulted in a list of items that we will immediately address:<br />
<br />
- Add scripting to shut off empty instances of Plane of Time<br />
- Raid messages of the day<br />
- Improving how we handle betas and the testing process<br />
- Increase the number of debuffs allowed on the MOBs<br />
- Increase buffs on players through AAs<br />
- Note field on raid window<br />
- Improved consent &amp; drag for raid, group and guild*<br />
- Improve corpse drag radius*<br />
- Make charms not no-drop<br />
- Guild and individual rewards for guild beta testing<br />
- Work on large To Do list....I know this one is a little random<br />
<br />
Future items we will immediately begin looking at and discussions are as follows:<br />
<br />
- Plane of Time instancing and other issues*<br />
- Back flaggings solutions to help with High-end guild atrophy<br />
- Improved raid and guild functionality<br />
- Auto loot all for your corpse<br />
- Improvements to Raid XP<br />
- Review the Epic 2.0 quests<br />
- No more alien NPCs ;-) (focusing more on familiar Norrathians themes)**<br />
- Solo LDoN-stype instances or similiar content***<br />
- Issues with item augmentations*<br />
- Possible enhancements to Guild Wars<br />
<br />
Of course these aren't all of the items. You brought us a CD, 2 books, 20 printed sheets and a manifesto. We'll need to go through all of those and our notes before we can really get a good tally of all of the wonderful ideas and questions that were presented.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your feedback and participation. We've had a great weekend and a wonderful display of things to come.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Robert Pfister<br />
Executive Producer<br />
EverQuest<br />
<br />
And the EverQuest Development Team!<br />
<br />
* Safehouse submitted ideas. Additionally, I was also able to speak one on one with one of the so called &quot;rogue guys&quot;, John Troy, Designer, and got much more covered than what made it to this preliminary list. I also spoke to the game designer who wrote the current storyline.<br />
<br />
** This idea was submitted by the Safehouse but got a lot of support from all attendees throughout the day.<br />
<br />
*** I brought this up but had added that the solo quests could be geared to be class specific and not necessarily entail &quot;hack and slash&quot; content but rely on class abilities, the addition didn't make it to the list but hopefully it is part of what they mean by &quot;similar content&quot;.<br />
<br />
It is to be noted that both John Smedley and Producer, Rod Humble apologized for Gates of Discord as part of their introductions before the offices tour began. An energetic discussion of how testing could be improved followed.<br />
<br />

EDIT: Longer report coming after 11:30PM PST tonight</div></div><hr />

Not something I personally considered, but after hearing it sounds good.  <br />
<br />
- Raid messages of the day<br />
Not sure of the point of this to focus on.  Maybe someone could clear it up for me.<br />
<br />
- Improving how we handle betas and the testing process<br />
Thank god<br />
<br />
- Increase the number of debuffs allowed on the MOBs<br />
Good, but hardly seems one of the major things wrong with the game.<br />
<br />
- Increase buffs on players through AAs<br />
Not sure I like AAs being considered for this, with the bard window in.  Maybe a separate box for debuffs.<br />
<br />
- Note field on raid window<br />
Again, helpful, but not a major concern for game functionality<br />
<br />
- Improved consent &amp;amp; drag for raid, group and guild*<br />
Yay!<br />
<br />
- Improve corpse drag radius*<br />
Yay!<br />
<br />
- Make charms not no-drop<br />
Why?  Are there charms out there now that are better than the one the dwarf gives you in PoK?  Or is this for twinks?<br />
<br />
- Guild and individual rewards for guild beta testing<br />
Hmm, if this goes live, who decides which guilds get the chance for the reward?  Will this be a case of the rich getting richer, or will there be some randomization to which guilds get chosen?<br />
<br />
- Work on large To Do list....I know this one is a little random<br />
n/a<br />
<br />
Overall it is a start, and I hope the game gets better because of this summit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm actually pretty estatic about this idea, if they allow raid leader to appoint a few people to keep the Raid MotD and/or public raid notes updated by a few of the people in raid.  (not just raid leader.)  This would be a great spot to put stuff like what raid we are doing, who is MT/MA/Rampage tank,  and  the CH rotation for the raid, and people can reference it without having to ask in channel &quot;who is in this role&quot; or whatever. (and constant spamming of channels with the info.)  It can just be in one place and referenced by the people who need to know anytime they need to know it. :)</div></div><hr />

They still haven't delivered it and it had all my notes I took. Next time all of us community  and class sites should have a mini powwow.</div></div><hr />

If anything the community getting together with a collective &quot;WTF?&quot; and doing something about it is more impressive than a much needed and long overdue response by SOE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
would be nice if they did that sort of thing more often (maybe not to that degree, but asking from major guilds and class websites some feedback every few months)..  <br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like their tryin to hold on to their customers, imagine that !<br />
<br />
keep it up soe =o</div></div><hr />

<br />
Smedley really thought it was helpful and definitely wants to do it again... possibly twice a year even depending on what the topic might be etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">06-06-04, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was asked in the main lounge by Sevian:<br />
<br />
But it seems in all of that... Maybe I missed something but when will they be fixing the bug in the game? I mean crashing in PoK, walls, etc. Was that discussed? Sounds like the first thing that should have been discussed. <br />
<br />
That was indeed one of the first things discussed, before the tour, as part of the &quot;welcome&quot; speech even... crashing, dx9 issues, not shipping out things that were broken. I felt that Saturday morning had a tinge of animosity in it really, all of us against &quot;them&quot;. My pics and movies are still uploading, you will be able to see their (Smedley and Rod Humble) postures in response to what we said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Point with the progression is that people should leave the zone when they're done farming/got the flags, so that the mobs are up for new people.. If big guilds got incentives to killing EP gods more often they'd hardly ever be up for those who just reached the EP..</div></div><hr />

Haha, you kidding me? Quite a few of those things are for casuals gamer and has no worth whatsoever for high-end raiders :) Also, that is NOT their final list.</div></div><hr />

Casuals have an incredible amount of content, and witha new tier of stuff coming for LDoN, progression up through elemental level equipment.<br />
<br />
What more do you want?<br />
<br />
If that isn't enough for you, then I suggest you stop trying to be a casual, and start being a raider to get the sort of equipment you feel you deserve.</div></div><hr />

This does seem to be a problem for guilds pushing the gates envelope, but the quote solution would be nice for those up and coming.<br />
<br />
Additionally,  most seem to be ignoring the fact that post-time guilds can consider doing alliances with peer or even up &amp;amp; coming guilds for time if they can't or won't re-recruit in order to go back.<br />
<br />
It all depends on how much you want time gear and whether or not you want to add more people.</div></div><hr />

The problem is if you've had so much atrophy you can't clear coirnav/rathe and quarm anymore.  So half your guild gets pissed off at dx9 plus the state of EQ and quits and the other half just gives up and quits because instead of working on Gates progression they're faced with starting over from Grummus to flag new members for Time to gear them up for Gates.  They're basically set back a year in progression and would rather quit and break their eq cd's than do all that crap over again for the millionth time, competing with guilds just finishing vt for low tier bosses over the next several months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was great meeting you too! They have my luggage and will be delivering it, hopefully it'll get here before I leave for work.<br />
<br />
Yblec, I thought the solo dungeon idea, the general promise to fix collision, pathing, etc, and the improvement on storyline would all benefit the casual player.  And I did push the class quest / trial / instance idea as well so that may come into play later. I think they are open to further suggestions if you have any ideas in particular you'd like to PM me.<br />
<br />
I added more pictures to the gallery btw, including a concept pic of the upcoming rogue epic weapon.</div></div><hr />

Now if they could just get rid of the edges on the side. I prefer the traditional flat dagger look, really. <br />
<br />
I kind of like the green wisp of smoke, though. It's better than a single pixel, yet it's not something that looks out of place or overly flashy.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't have to be equipment...just general game play experience.  Nobody's telling you that to do quests you have to be a casual player, don't tell casuals that to advance in the game they have to raid.  It's very possible that if more people start leaning toward this point of view, there's going to be a lot of people leaving EverQuest not just because of the bugs...<br />

When I started playing EverQuest it was a game for everyone of all play styles.  Forcing people into your style isn't ever going to make people happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
and for the dude earlier who was whining about nothing for the casual gamer and was quitting<br />
<br />
<br />
good riddance~  <br />
there's a ton of content available for the lower level, or casual player (I take advantage of the 90% empty zones with my twinks)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qutsmnie</div><div class="date">06-07-04, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The largest issue facing EQ today is that the developers have completely destroyed the purpose of guilds of people that can only participate in guild functions 4 to 10 hours a week.<br />
<br />
There is no point to that guild anymore.  In order for that guild to have a purpose they need to get alot less stingy with drops associated with farms.<br />
<br />
Back in the heyday of halls of testing farming you could log on 5 hours a week and get a decent set of gear in about 6 months or less with equally light weight commited players.<br />
<br />
Nowadays that role for a guild is missing.<br />
<br />
The stuff that a set of players can get that dont play much as a guild is almost not relevant.<br />
<br />
INDIVIDUALLY you can get great stuff.  But the guilds purpose at the light playtime level is nonexistant.<br />
<br />
It didnt used to be this way cause farms were simplier, tradeable goods were less significant, ldon farming was non existant, and finally drop rates on no drop armors that were part of guild farming were alot more generous.<br />
<br />
It is VITAL in the next expansion that SoE return purpose to the guild of player that only play  6 hours a week as a guild.  Its vital because EQ is only great when its a social game. <br />
<br />
&quot;The look at the left over content&quot; viewpoint doesnt work cause the casual guild doesnt learn targets quickly and doesnt change targets quickly.  Farms have to be all purpose.<br />
<br />
The content of guild farms for levels 60 to 65 should get you an equivilant set of armor to LDON playing 5 hours a week for 4 months.  But ONLY if you farm as a guild.  You need to return the massive social structure to EQ.<br />
<br />
When I was a noob at level 54 and played alot less then I do now the guild was still vital to my development.  We hit kael areana, Halls of testing, and epic raids in planes once a week.  In all the left over content those raids for the light weight guild have never been replaced.  They have to be replaced and soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Return to the concept of relatively common uber drops from trash mobs in raid zones (common meaning rare but common enough that they can be farmed).  Some of this games guilds need it to return their purpose.</div></div><hr />

Quite a few of those things are for casuals gamer and has no worth whatsoever for high-end raiders :) Also, that is NOT their final list.Not to mention the casual game is no-where near as broken as the end-game raid game. Casuals have an incredible amount of content, and witha new tier of stuff coming for LDoN, progression up through elemental level equipment. <br />
<br />
What more do you want? <br />
<br />
If that isn't enough for you, then I suggest you stop trying to be a casual, and start being a raider to get the sort of equipment you feel you deserve.<br />
Hmmm...  I'm sure that you guys are sharp, talented players, etc, etc, but you really do not seem to understand the situation.<br />
<br />
Which is entirely understandable -- you're not in the middle of it, and even from the middle it's not easy to put a finger on.  I've been sitting here staring at the screen for about half an hour now trying to think of a way to describe it.  Unsuccessfully.<br />
<br />
There may be a lot of &quot;content&quot;, but there's not much really worth doing.  It has nothing to do with gear -- who cares about shiny pixels with big numbers if the game itself isn't worth playing?<br />
<br />
Casual progression is seriously stagnant right now.  LDoN just sucks; more LDoN is just more suck.  Even the bazaar is more exciting and engaging than buying junk with ap's.  <br />
<br />
GoD casual content is limited to one or two &quot;here, have some freebie-trash-to-make-you-feel-like-you-got-something-for-your-$30-and-get-the-hell-out-of-here&quot; type zones.  <br />
<br />
Everything else is 2-4 years old, and most of it wont even give you xp because the mobs are too low.  (even though they'll kill you just the same -- usually too far away from anywhere for a res)<br />

And other thoughts, while I'm back here again:  I agree quite strongly with what Maht Stohlit and Qutsmnie posted.  <br />
<br />
Low end guilds have been hit particularly hard since the last expansion by the vacuum in the upper tiers.  Every guild I associate with has lost large blocks of it's core membership in the last few months to heavy recruitment by raiding guilds at various tiers and three either have folded or are folding due to the losses combined with a general lack of focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maximoC</div><div class="date">06-07-04, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back onto the mid range vs. high end content.<br />
<br />
I think if they continue to release end game content x-pacs, then all the bells and whistles that go w/ it should be patched instead of having to purchase the dam x-pac.<br />
I mean stuff like AA's, bankspace, new spells etc. (lvl's are fine with the purcahse atm)<br />
<br />
Why? It creates an animosity toward SoE from alot of midend guilds/players that will not see most of the x-pac content for YEARS perhaps but are forced into buying it for the bells and whistles.<br />
<br />
Guilds are still working on SSra and VT for chrissakes. What chance in hell do they have taking out RZtW nevermind trying ikkinz. But yet, they will feel the need to buy the xpac for the AA's, bankspace. <br />
<br />
Exapnsions are suppsoed to help progress everyone throughout the game.<br />
Not the select few who can gather 54-72 buddies nightly to kill whatever alien is on the list.<br />
<br />
Even though I had a blast in PoP cause I was in a good guild, I always felt that it was a half expansion. No lower end stuff. Even SoL had stuff like Dawnshroud, Pauludal, etc. PoP had PoJ for the lowest zone exp.<br />
<br />
GoD, well it isnt even a 5th of an expansion. 10 zones? whoopie....</div></div><hr />

Yes, everything should be fixed within 24 hours, and all problems, even those that have existed for years should also be resolved within 24 hours of the end of this summit as well.<br />

Everyone that was there seems to have returned with some pretty positive attitudes. Even ones that went there expecting to be smiled at, but not much to change.<br />
<br />
Lets now give SOE some time to get things working again. I can assure you that as a programmer, I know that its going to take serious time to deal with some of the issues that SOE faces. And class balancing is but one of the myriad of problems they have at the moment. Some can be fixed quickly. In fact, something of rogue interest, corpse dragging fixes,  were pushed to the test server yesterday. If they infact help things, we should see those changes on live servers within a week or so.</div></div><hr />

Then, yeah, I guess I really don't understand anymore, which is terrible.<br />
<br />
Some background.<br />
<br />
I started playing EQ in Oct of '99.  Made a DE rogue cause my reason for buying the game was all my RL friend played and they had all made dark elves.  We had a nice little family guild, named House D`Moraine.  We logged in 2-3 hours a night, kept halflings as guild pets, and spent far, far more time chatting and socializing then trying to actually accomplish anything in the game.  None of us had the best equipment, but then, none of us was doing anything that required the best equipment.  We played *casually* and didn't much care about beating the game.  Which is a good thing, cause 5 years later I still haven't beaten it, lol.  Somewhere along the way, however, a couple members of the family guild ended up in big raiding guilds, once of which was at the very top of our server.  I was not one of those people, but I could see all the cool stuff my friends were getting, and damn, I wanted a part of that action.  I'd be in groups with their characters, and they could do stuff I couldn't even imagine.  Playing casually for me started to fall to the wayside as I re-thought my focus towards the raiding game. By this time, though, the Luclin expansion is announced and due out in 2 months, and as far as raiding goes, I'm woefully behind.  I ended up applying to a mid-end guild which was holding weekly HoT runs, and taking down a few other select targets through the week.  The first time I stepped into HoT, I was level 54, and raid buffed to right around 4k hp.  If my best resist was over 70, I'd be shocked.  I was eventually accepted into that guild, and went through a full range of progression with them through Velious, Luclin, and PoP right up to the elemental planes.  Due to some personality conflicts, and at a few friends' urging, I applied to a new guild this past October.  I got PoTime access, and then when GoD came out we were doing Smith Rondo, mountain trials and Kod`Taz in the first weeks of the expansion.<br />
<br />
Why go through all that?  Because my character now in no way resembles that wide-eyed lvl 54 rogue I used to play.  My point is, everyone is using two terms, and two terms only to describe play styles.  Raider and Casual.  In my opinion, a person who is playing 5-6 hours a night, 5-6 days a week and constantly smacking their head up against the limit of what their gear allows is *not* a casual player.  You might not be raiding, but you've got the mind-set of someone who wants the good stuff from the game.  Whatever might be the best way to describe you, casual certainly isn't it.  My question to those thinking like this is, and it's not meant to be insulting in any way, what are you doing in the game that requires better gear then Ornate/LDoN mix?  When I started raiding, I had my epic in main hand and a Kelorek`Dar Spine Razor in off-hand.  Those were more then enough for what I spent my time doing as a casual.  Not until I became a full-time raider did I *need* anything better, even though I *wanted* better for a long time.<br />
<br />
So, help me understand the mind-set of the current casual player.  I see vast stretches of content for you, from deep in Kunark dungeons, to giants and dragons in Velious, aliens and rock-monsters in Luclin (not mentioning snakes, hate em, and don't wish em upon enyone) 6-7 completely different zones in PoP which require mothing more for access then simple levels, two entire expansions aimed directly at you with LoY and LDoN, and yes, some very minor amounts of content in GoD.  I see all this stuff, and wonder exactly what casuals are complaining about.  While it may be true that doing that content isn't going to match you up against a PoTime god any time in the near future, that doesn't make the content not worth doing.  It's only not worth doing if you aren't really a casual player, but a power-gamer shut out, for whatever reason, from the raid game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ffossip</div><div class="date">06-08-04, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will have to make this shorter than I wanted to (/rude work).<br />
<br />
Of all those things you mentioned for the casual player to do, &quot;been there, done that&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've been playing for over 5 years now, most of the time 6+ hours on weekdays, 12 or so on weekends.  I've hunted in Ssra till it was boring.  I've hunted in The Deep till it was boring.  I've hunted in Sebilis till it was boring. (etc).<br />
<br />
I guess a little more background;  I have played with the same 4 or so people for the last 4+ years.  We occasionally shrink down to 2 people and go as high as 6 depending on who is away and who is playing. We are all in the 300 to 500 AA range.  None of us have ever been in a guild, and none of us have ever been on a raid.  We were the first people on the server to complete the alternate Crypt of Decay flag and spent time xping there when the top guild on the server was in the process of learning the Bertox encounter.  Nobody else was there, just us and them.<br />
<br />
Why do endgame folk no longer do ToV or Plane of Growth and the like?  Because it's old.  They spent long enough doing it the first time around, they don't want to go back and do it again - this is our reason for not wanting to go back and redo things all over again.<br />
<br />
When an expansion comes out, especially something like PoP or GoD, 100%, or close to 100% of it is usable for the endgame community.  You all had to go through PoN, PoJ, PoV, PoD, etc etc. to eventually get to Elementals and Plane of Time.  That end content is however not usable by the non-raiding community.  I'm not trying to say it should be.  What I'm saying is that you get (example) 20 zones to go through before it has become &quot;same old, same old&quot;.  People like my friends and I get 10 to go through.<br />
<br />
In the past, content &quot;expired&quot; its way down to the casuals like my friends and I.  When Kunark came out, there was no way we could do Juggs and Reets, that was endgame stuff.  But sure enough, as time went by, we could easily get down there.  When Velious first came out, Halls of Testing was the place to be for endgamers.  Sure enough, that expired its way down to us as well.  That stopped happening, to a degree with Luclin and certainly with PoP.  No matter what the level cap is raised to, no matter what new AA's are put into the game, Elementals will never &quot;expire&quot; down to us.  Encounters like Rallos Zek are simply undoable with a group of 4 to 6 characters and always will be.  So no matter what happens, PoP will be a partial expansion to players like my friends and I.  Sure, we had that with previous expansions - Luclin - 1 zone (VT), Velious - 1 zone (ST), Kunark - 1 zone (VP).  PoP really jacked up the number of zones we will never see - Time, Elementals, HoHB, PoNB, etc.  GoD was more of the same with many, many zones past Sewer Trials.<br />
<br />
So what the problem has become is that while the endgame players get 100 zones to work through and find enjoyment in, those of us not part of that group get 50, even though we all play the same amount (that is PLAY not PAY).  It really does stand to reason that non-raiding, unguilded folk such as myself and my friends will run out of places to play, for the same reason the endgame folk run out of places to play; been there, done that.<br />
<br />
What is the answer?  No idea.  SOE doesn't send me a consultants paycheck bi-weekly, so I'll leave it up to them to solve the problem.  I will say however that it's quickly wearing thin.  Will Omens solve the problem?  I really doubt it, even if flag/key requirements are removed.  It will have to be challenging to people geared with the best stuff from Time and GoD to be a challenge to the endgame folk which means people such as myself in top LDoN gear will be little more than a speedbump.  I will say however that the answer is not to put better gear on LDoN vendors.  We've already done in excess of 2 or 3 hundred adventures.  That content is now getting worn out.  We really don't want to have to go back and do 5 or 6 hundred more of them, anymore than an endgamer would want to go back and spend the next 6 months to a year farming Elementals for &quot;upgraded&quot; elemental armor.<br />
<br />
And this isn't a slam on people who like the endgame in EQ.  I think it's great that people enjoy that type of thing and wish them all the happiness in the world.  It's just something that isn't my cup of tea.  I respect them, I hope they respect me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maht Stohlit</div><div class="date">06-08-04, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what are you doing in the game that requires better gear then Ornate/LDoN mix?<br />
<br />
That's not really the point, which Lithe pointed out earlier.  The point is content, progression.  How would you feel if your choices were:  Play LDoN as your endgame.  Or...play with people you don't really share any goals with.  That's the choice that you're putting to us.  And you're doing it from the point of view that you are doing harder and harder mobs so you need better and better gear.  Which says that you deserve progression, but everyone who doesn't play like you should be happy with what they have.<br />
<br />
So, help me understand the mind-set of the current casual player. I see vast stretches of content for you, from deep in Kunark dungeons, to giants and dragons in Velious, aliens and rock-monsters in Luclin<br />
<br />
There's also lots of raid mobs in those zones...how come you don't raid Velketor?  How come you don't raid trakanon?<br />
<br />
Because you've been there, done that, gotten the loot.  You've progresesd past that.<br />

Guess what...so have I...  I was there when the expansions came out.  I was raiding those expansions when they came out.  Almost everyone in the game (even social players) want progression.  How can you ask for more raid content and then tell people that they should be happy with LDoN being their endgame?  How can you say that one set of players deserves progression and another set doesn't?<br />
<br />
LDoN gets old quick.  Everyone knows that.  Sure you're progressing...but you're just grinding at that point.  And what after you get your armor?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I'll use this space to say I agree completely with Ffossip, who made my point better than I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SincroFashad</div><div class="date">06-08-04, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You both sort of missed my point.<br />
<br />
LDoN is not your end-game, and if you think it is, you are sorely mistaken.  You use LDoN to gear up for LDoN hard which you use to gear up for early GoD which gives you access to mid-GoD, etc.  A semi-active poster on this site is Steppyn Razor, rogue and a member of a small (8 members or so) guild on BB server.  They don't raid, but they did progress through LDoN normal to LDoN hard, then when GoD came out they did the 4 sewers trials, did both mountain trials and have even  taken a crack or two at the first couple Ikkinz single group trials.  They XP in Kod`Taz.  They could XP in Yxtta if they wanted to (but don't since XP in that zone isn't worth it).  They kill mini-named in KT.<br />
<br />
Zones they do not now and probably won't get access to: VP, ST, VT, elementals, time, uqua, qvic, Inkta'tu, tacvi, txevu (sp?)  Let's have a look at those zones, shall we?  VP: they could have access here if they wanted to.  They can handle the mini-named in Kod`Taz, I'm sure they can handle Trak.  ST:  An end-game zone for velious, but ironically not *the* end game zone for that expansion.  nToV has bettah stuff, and any casual who wants to can walk right in.  :)  VT: An end-game raid zone requiring a major guild victory over Emp Ssra plus a mind-numbing key quest to enter.  Anyone in VT is not a casual player.  Elementals and Time: The end-game raid zones (plus some sweet XP spots) for PoP.  Access to these requires major guild victories over Rallos Zek and Solusek Ro for elementals, and the 4 elemental gods for Time.  On BB server, there's a fair number of casuals and part-time raiders in elemental planes due to an open raiding channel.  Said channel is currently working on the 4 elemental gods for PoTime access.  Uqua: a non-XP group friendly raid zone.  Not only are casuals not in this zone, casuals don't want to be in this zone.  Trust me.  Let me know the moment you think it would be fun to have all your stats lowered by 305, your int and wis by 355, and to have mobs spawn on your spot when you die.  To have 90% of the mobs see SoS, all of em to see invis.  Uqua is like a college course in Organic Chemistry.  It's a weed-out zone designed to make people give up.  Qvic: end-game reward zone much like VT and elementals.  In a year you'll have open raiders here, maybe less.  Inktu'ta: This is a far as I've been, and only a dozen or so guilds have been farther.  Difficulty is on par with Uqua, but appears to never have been as broken as Uqua was.  Tacvi and Txevu: End-game zones for the hard-core raiders.  Casuals currently have no possibility of entering these two zones.<br />
<br />
So, this group of casual players, who play a heck of a lot less then 5-6 hours per day 5-6 days a week, have progressed to all but 13 zones in all of EQ.  You got every zone in original EQ, all but 1 in Kunark, all but 1 in Velious, all but 1 in Luclin, all but 6 in PoP, all of LoY, all of LDoN, all but 5 in GoD.<br />
<br />
Those are the people I've formed my in-game opinions about casual players on.  When casuals tell me they can't do anything past LDoN, I know for absolute fact they are not trying hard enough, because I've seen what progression-oriented casual players can accomplish.</div></div><hr />

In the meantime, I do have a few quick comments:<br />
<br />
So, help me understand the mind-set of the current casual player. <br />
First of all, to yet again re-itterate a point which has been stated over and over again [insert a few extra gramatic redundancies here] yet which it feels as though many raid mind-players either cannot or choose not to wrap their heads around for whatever reason:<br />
<br />
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE LOOT.<br />
<br />
I am not sitting here asking for better gear.  There are still a ~lot~ of upgrades which are very much within my reach at the moment anyway.  The issue is:  Why bother?<br />
<br />
Time and time again when the question of casual progression is raised, raid-minded players respond with more or less the statement: &quot;Stop complaining; grind LDoN and start raiding if you want better loot.&quot; -- which misses the point entirely...<br />
<br />
Namely:  Why bother? (and that it's not about the gear)<br />
<br />
Itemization ONLY has value when the game itself is compelling and fun.  Currently, casual gameplay is pretty stagnant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maht Stohlit</div><div class="date">06-08-04, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/nod Lithe<br />
<br />
My point about LDoN being the endgame was this:  Generally, if you have to spend the next 12 months in an area for advancement...it is your end game at the moment.<br />
<br />
Break that down...take say, a shadowknight.  You've said yourself that to do hards you should gear up in LDoN...so you spend 1492 points on each piece of armor...let's say you get the Breasplate, Greaves, Helm, Boots, Vambraces, and a Bracer.  That's not counting the augs or anything.  With comparable gear to those as a shadowknight, doing nothing but normal adventures, you will have done roughly 147 adventures.  In fairly decent gear (pre LDoN) that takes roughly 150 hours, probably more but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt here.  Now, you've just spent 150 hours doing nothing but LDoN.  Nothing.  You have roughly 7000 hp (because you sold items and bought good upgrades in other slots).  Since chances are, you only want the maximum adventures in each zone...you've seen every LDoN zone in Takish, Mistmoore, and EverFrost at least 3 times, most of them more.  And let's face it, it's not like each instance is extremely diverse from the last instance.  You can zone into any of those zones and know within three steps a) the layout of the zone  b) all possible spawn points for the guy you're rescuing and c) all possible spawn points for assassination mobs.  You don't need a map, you've done it that many times.  You've effectively completed 3/5ths of LDoN.  And, you're not even done with augmenting your armor to make it on par with VT armor.  All of this took every bit of play time that you have for 150 hours.  It's mindnumbing, it's boring, the only thing that's kept you doing it is so you can move on and if you didn't have your best friends for company you'd have quit long ago.  And you've done all this...so that you can complete a hard in 90 minutes.<br />
<br />
Most of the people I know who went this route either failed 500 or so instances of LDoN hards because they were zoning in to see if a name was up and leaving the adventure if it wasn't.  Or they've given up on everquest due to the monotony.  The ones who did the hard missions for gear have moved on to farming the sewers in basically the same manner.<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for easy gear, and I'm not asking for an easy way out...  I just want to do something that doesn't feel like work when I play my game.  That's not to say I don't want to work for stuff and earn stuff.  But if I have to put in x hours a week doing something I don't enjoy in order to move on to a new tier of things that I don't enjoy...I'm going to just work overtime at my job, at least there I get paid. =P<br />
<br />
I don't care if the new design of EQ for casuals means they don't give me ANY gear at all.  As long as the story progresses.  As long as I'm having fun doing new things...<br />
<br />
It's not that I can't progress past LDoN....it's that after putting in all that work and those hours...the prospect of doing it again to progress doesn't thrill me.  But maybe EQ's just the wrong game for me these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martard</div><div class="date">06-08-04, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant help but think that the 'casual player' with 300-500aa is by far the exception.  If you have the time to put into that much playtime and have done everything you can, why not join a raiding guild.  I know on Torv there is at least 1 raiding guild that doesn't have required attendance, and they are in EP's, working on time.  I cant imagine other servers don't have similar guilds.  With a group like that, you can be in KT, you can be in all but the 13 zones mentioned above and you could be in a guild seeing some of those 13.<br />
<br />
I expect that most casual players have never seen much of ToV, Ssra, ect.  People say that Velious was the best expansion, and I can agree, but a casual guild can do almost all of velious if not all.  It will take longer, but the content is there.  A casual guild should be able to do most of Luclin &amp;amp; LoY. There are even a decent amount of things a casual guild could do in PoP and GoD. There is stuff to do, most of the casuals I know, have never seen a ton of zones that a casual guild would let them see, a guild that raids a coupe times a week to get people into these zones and see the bosses, fight the fights.  If they are too hard, you probably need to use a different strategy to win.  If it was considered progression and content when it came out, and you still haven't done it, why is it not progression or content anymore?  The only reason I can find is because the loot 'isn't worth it', but it isn't about loot, right?  Count me in on the masses of non-casuals that just don't get it...  There are tons of fun things to do in the game still, I see casual guilds on my server doing NToV, doing small raids in pop and progressing.  Sure it might not be a norm, sure it might not be easy but most of the fun is in it being hard.<br />
<br />
Maybe all the casuals are raiders of the first 3 expansions that got burnt out and became casuals.  If you don't want to raid, there logically has to be things you wont see.  I don't know, but I really don't get it.  I don't see casuals locked out of pop zones if they put there mind to it.  If any of you could say what exactly you want, what would make the mid level game better, please describe it for us.  Describe it to SOE, they say they want to make the game better, and it sounds like they are serious, tell us and them, lets get it done for you...<br />

The point is that those of us who have played for 4 or 5 years HAVE done it.<br />
<br />
If you're an up and comer there's a TON of content in the game for you.  And there'd be just a little bit more content for me if I wanted to be a raider again.  But I don't.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is that there should be more raid and non-raid content.  It's not taking anything away from ANYONE, just adding to the experience of quite a few people.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
Right now, I make the game fun by hanging out with those people that I enjoy hanging out with...and doing things we enjoy.  I'm burnt out on a lot of stuff in the game, and like everyone else I just want more...and new.  But I love EverQuest...and what it used to be.  I don't want to take anything away from raiders.  I don't compare my gear to raid gear.  I just want to have fun...and if I only end up getting fun out of EQ by the people in it...I have their screen names~<br />
<br />
I get that devs are a limited resource *snicker*  But I don't understand the argument.  What's wrong with a game that caters to both styles of play?  Wouldn't you get and retain the most people that way?<br />
<br />
Edit: Anyway, this is an argument that's been going on for a long time and hasn't a resolution that you or I could convice the other of.  And either way, it certainly doesn't belong in official news ;-)</div></div><hr />

I have no desire to join a raiding guild.  I have no desire to ever raid.  I have no desire to ever join a guild.  Why on earth would anyone do something in a game that they don't want to do?  It's supposed to be about doing what is fun, not suffering through stuff you don't like to have fun.<br />
<br />
With the optimal group, yes you can probably get to KT with a single group.  Unfortunately the main tank is a Shadow Knight so Vxed and Tipt events and further can be ruled out.<br />

Sjarin of Torv<br />
<br />
I don't care about Plane of Time instances.  I don't care about anything that involves raids or guilds.<br />
<br />
What do I want?<br />
<br />
1) Make it so I can log into the game for longer than 10 minutes at a time without locking up.  4 higher end computers, variety of processors, video cards, etc., all with the same problem, multiple accounts.  My crappy trader computer stays online 24/7 though.  I've spent many, MANY hours reinstalling OS's from scratch, trying many different video drivers, swapping hardware all around, all to no avail... and I'm tired of it.  I'm not SOE QA.  With standard hardware, me and thousands of other people can't play the game anymore (since the DirectX 9 patch).<br />
<br />
2) Make it so I don't fall from the sky for 20k damage when zoning on my horse (happened 3 times now while I was trying to move characters around, troubleshooting problem 1).<br />
<br />
3) Make it so 50% of NPCs/mobs in the game are not underground.<br />
<br />
What is a reasonable amount of time I should have to wait before I can play the game again, like I did 2 months ago?  I've been waiting over a month now, and still no go.  Yes, it may be a bad attitude to have, but I've reached the limit of my patience &quot;trying&quot; this and &quot;trying&quot; that.  I didn't cause the problem, I should have to spend hours trying to resolve it.  In the same vein, if I did something to screw up my system I wouldn't expect SOE to spend hours and hours of their time troubleshooting stuff on their end to make my systems work again.<br />
<br />
Once that is all resolved, if ever, what do I want?  Things to do in the game, the same as everyone else.  Here is the breakdown though:<br />
<br />
You as a raider spend 40 hours online a week.  That time is split between doing solo/single group stuff (20 hours) and doing raids (20 hours).  Let's say that there is 400 hours worth of raiding entertainment in an expansion and 400 hours worth of solo/single group entertainment in an expansion.  After 20 weeks of playing, 4 months basically, you are starting to cast about for interesting stuff to do.<br />
<br />
I, as a &quot;casual&quot; player, spend 40 hours online a week.  That time is solely spent with solo/single group content.  There is 400 hours worth of solo/single group content in the expansion.  After 10 weeks of playing, 2 months basically, I reach that same point the raiding person reaches after 20 weeks.  Do I think I am somehow entitled to that 400 hours of entertainment locked into the raiding category?  Not at all.  It's my choice to not partake in that stuff and I don't think it should be unlocked to me at all.  What's the answer?  No idea, but I'm pretty sure it's not solo LDoN, Plane of Time instancing, or increased corpse drag radius.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">06-08-04, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ffossip said<br />
What's the answer? No idea...<br />
<br />
But that's the point of discussions now what was brought to the table is what folks had given feedback about. I don't know if you posted anything prior to the summit, but let's try and find the answer now.<br />
<br />
What I enjoyed most as a casual player was building something in a sandbox. The sandbox is made up of the rules and constraints of the game I am in, what I build is whatever I can with my imagination. Last big build it was to join up with an all Barbarian guild that would not even group with folks on the other teams (PvP server). An example of a raid I went on was to &quot;raid&quot; Rivervale. It was a memorable event not only for us but for those we raided... I got tells years later recalling that night from the other point of view and how fun it was to see a horde of Barbarians coming over the hill.<br />
<br />
My point?  My guild's answer was to create our own content to some extent. Perhaps that's the direction EQ could take for the casual player? And if it is how do they go about it? <br />
<br />
A &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; line of questing was suggested in the discussion I was in, where quests could be completed with a similar outcome / reward but through different methods. Does that appeal to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ffossip</div><div class="date">06-08-04, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it goes to the heart of what appealed to me in the first place with regards to Everquest...<br />
<br />
I want one person, or a group of 3 or 4 people to make Everquest THEIR game.  I don't want hundreds of thousands of people taking part in the design of it.  If it appeals to me (like it did originally), I'll lap it up.  If it doesn't, I'll just move on with no regrets.  When it's one persons game, it's a very tight, focused direction that the game takes.  With the entire community giving input, you end up with not only a mish mash of ideas that lack that type of focus, but you end up breeding animosity within the community - people see that they implemented so-and-so's idea, even though they thought it was stupid, but they see their own idea get rejected, even though they think it's a much better idea.<br />
<br />
It's a very hard thing to explain, but I'll try.  In the very beginning, Everquest had a certain feel to it.  Everyone played a little part in the world of Norrath.  You shared things in common with people you had never spoke to.  You remember that name from your starting city, or you remember seeing that person ask in /ooc for a heal at T2 in West Karana.  There was really a sense of community and everyone belonged. Little by little that part of the game has disappeared.  I can't even comprehend the mindset of people that are driven to get to Plane of Time or complete GoD for example.<br />
<br />
In the old days, there was a common &quot;enemy&quot;.  Verant never listened to anything the customer said.  They shaped the game around &quot;The Vision&quot; regardless of what the community said most times.  That person next to you was your ally in that fight.  But things began changing.  Verant and then SOE started implementing things that customers asked for, and suddenly that person beside you became your enemy.  They started looking at the things that you could do that they couldn't and started pointing fingers, waiting for Verant/SOE to either a) come down on you, or b) give them a boost.  The community became fragmented and remains that way today.<br />
<br />
Yes, it probably sounds stupid to most people, but if SOE would just stop listening to the customer with regards to encounters, class balance, etc., I think that not only the game but the community would benefit from it in the long run.  Yes, it would be a very rough road getting back to that point, and a lot of customers would leave, but it would be good not only for the long term playability of the game, but for community unity as well.  Someone at SOE needs to step in and make EQ the game THEY want to play.  This IS NOT to say they shouldn't listen to the community as it pertains to bugs.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong, but I see that EQ started to go downhill on the quality side when it got to the point where SOE did not have the resources to fully inhouse QA large encounters.  For years now, one of the biggest complaints I've seen from the bleeding edge community is that when they get to the final zones, they are not finished (Time, Vex Thal, etc).  It's because the resources simply do not exist for SOE to log in 72 testers to actually play the encounter the way a guild does.  A company, and especially a software company, shouldn't ever get to the point where it develops things it doesn't know anything about.<br />
<br />
The biggest fault I see isn't a fault at all.  It was just SOE's desire to make money, and there is certainly no crime in that.  Instead of being like every other game out there where the game is released, people buy it, play it, then move on to something else, SOE tried to keep those customers from moving on by allowing the game to expand to a scope that is outside of their ability to realistically control.<br />
<br />
I'm probably completely out to lunch with this.  Lately, EQ has just become more and more foreign to me.  I see the game constantly becoming faster/easier/bigger and see that as being completely out of step of what it used to be.  Others I guess see these things as improvements, I see it as speeding faster and faster towards the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ffossip</div><div class="date">06-08-04, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should followup the above by stating that it's completely unrealistic to go forward with any of those ideas.  It would create just too many problems for both SOE and their investors.<br />
<br />
And barring that, I have no other answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">06-09-04, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'd say that was a good answer.<br />
<br />
I just put up my extended report on the summit, you might be interested to read it.<br />
<br />
I'll address a few things:<br />
<br />
You mentioned small group play, yourself or 2-3 people.  The LDON solo instances were also mentioned to possibly be for 2-3 people as well. LDoN was not supposed to be the only vehicle for solo or small group content by the way.<br />
<br />
Also, EQ2 is said to be able to have a group of 6 fight in a &quot;high end&quot; encounter according to information I got at E3 (see the Game Reviews section for the write up). If they are doing that in EQ2 perhaps they will bring it to EQ in some way.<br />
<br />
It's because the resources simply do not exist for SOE to log in 72 testers to actually play the encounter the way a guild does. A company, and especially a software company, shouldn't ever get to the point where it develops things it doesn't know anything about. <br />
<br />
The producers acknowledged that they messed up big time in testing. They limited the number of testers thinking it would ruin &quot;the surprise&quot; if they let too many test it.  One of the idea thrown out as a fix was to let entire guilds test expansions to simulate a real raid situation.<br />
<br />
More is in the long report. I really gotta get to bed now, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timchet</div><div class="date">06-09-04, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&amp;lt;-- guy with bad name.<br />
<br />
It was great meeting Fricka, Grabbit, etc.  Buncha good folks.  Normally I'm a pretty skeptical guy, but it seems that SOE has finally &quot;gotten it&quot; and they know that this is their last chance.  I also felt that the 'casual gamer' was represented well, and a number of things us 'ubergamers' or whatever we're being called at this point, asked for are global fixes that effect all players.  <br />
<br />
(Information in regards to the following I have also seen posted on other boards (and could be on the Safehouse, it's been a busy week) so I'm less concerned not remembering if I was told I couldnt post this or not)  I spent some time talking to the dev that is currently working on Epic 1.5 and 2.0.  I'm pretty excited about this.  1.5 will be a mid-way point in the quest, beatable by 3 or so groups, with the reward being equivalent to a Time dagger (or thereabouts).  That will give the 'casual gamer' the opportunity for an upgraded dagger and a new 'long term' goal.  Epic 2.0 will be the best dagger in the OOW expansion.  Will take a large raiding guild to defeat some of the main quest mobs.  Fortunately, those main quest mobs, in addition to dropping epic items, will also drop quite a bit of gear that guilds will want to farm.  So it will be less of a hassle to get a force together for Epic completion.<br />
<br />
All in all, the trip gave players and devs a forum to be absolutely candid.  In the morning meeting we had Saturday before the tour and roundtable discussions, I stood up and told Smedley that the storyline since Velious has &quot;sucked ass&quot;.  Decent round of applause after that one.  I spoke with the lead dev for PoP during the tour (he had looked for me, to see what my thoughts were on post-Velious storyline) and I explained that one of the large issues is that &quot;decision-making&quot; has been removed.  Faction means nothing.  Remember dragons, dwarves, and giants?  Now it's all about discovering best progression path.<br />
<br />
At this point, I look for SOE to (slowly but surely) fix the problems.  I fear that many will be impatient, and complain that the fixes are coming too slowly.  I've done what I could to caution people against this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ffossip</div><div class="date">06-09-04, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll address a few things:<br />
<br />
You mentioned small group play, yourself or 2-3 people.  The LDON solo instances were also mentioned to possibly be for 2-3 people as well. LDoN was not supposed to be the only vehicle for solo or small group content by the way.<br />
<br />
I'm REALLY not trying to get into an argument about this, so please don't take it as such.  I'm simply trying to get my point across, as the default &quot;leader&quot; of the group I play with (or used to play with, back when I could log on).<br />
<br />
While the LDoN changes may be the answer for some, it is not the answer for us.  We started doing LDoN adventures the day it was released and did 4 or 5 a day, everday, for quite a few months, until everyone had looted what they wanted and purchased what they wanted with their AP.  By the time GoD came out, we were finished with LDoN.  Incidentally, at any one time there we have between 4 and 8 accounts logged on (some 2 box). Solo, or 2-3 person LDoN's doesn't add anything for us.  We have never had a problem with having 4-6 accounts logged on.<br />
<br />
So while the endgame folk get raid changes and flag changes and zone changes for zones like Ikkinz, Uqua, and others, we get to go back and do more LDoN's.  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for the endgame folk that they are getting some issues they want addressed.<br />
<br />
I thought about this off and on for most of the day and realized that it probably comes across as whiney.  If people view it as such, then so be it I guess.<br />
<br />
For raiders, SOE is going to be re-visiting the endgame GoD stuff.  Guilds that haven't been able to get into Ikkinz and beyond will be able to. Guilds that haven't been able to get into Uqua and beyond will be able to. And Qvic and Tacvi and Txevu.  All new stuff.  1 month from now you'll be further along than you are today.  A month after that even further, and a month after that, further still.<br />
<br />
What is there for the non-raider, unguilded person.  More LDoN.  Not NEW LDoN, but the same old LDoN.  Even though said person will have already ground out 300 adventures already.<br />
<br />
While the raider gets to continue to progress through the game, exploring new challenges, the non-raider ends up getting no new challenges.  Just the same old LDoN.  There seems to be very little in the way of progression for the non-raiding, non-guilded player in the coming months.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong.  I don't want to be given some type of free pass to Uqua, Qvic, etc. - even if I COULD utilize those zones (which I cannot).  Those are challenges for YOU.  I want challenges for me, and the people like me.</div></div><hr />

The different reports I've read all have guarded optimism.  People want to think the best of SoE but they also want to see results.  <br />
<br />
People from the fan sites were invited to give a general perspective, I think, on how things could be improved.  Per Arminya on EverQuest Role-players (http://go.ezboard.com/beverquestroleplayers) SoE's definition of a casual player is <br />
<br />
<br />
A casual gamer is one who does not have the enormous amount of time required for the uber guilds. He typically belongs to a guild that is smaller than uber guilds and enjoys the ride rather than the race. A casual player usually wants to log on for 1 to 4 hours, play and then log off. This is not a hard rule obviously and it's a very broad definition. <br />
<br />
If someone logs on for a few hours nearly every night of the year for the last 4 or 5 years, they're likely to have at least 200 in some tradeskill, and tons of AAs.  If this same person always groups with the same people, they're going to be a well oiled machine and be able to get experience faster.  In my view, LDoN was geared towards the casual player so they would have opportunities to earn spells and items that would normally cost an enormous amount of plat.  Unfortunately, I've found that my characters might be waiting for an hour or more to try and find a group because there aren't enough people LFG around their level to make up a successful LDoN group.  Anything they add to the LDoNs will help these individuals.</div></div><hr />

You're welcome, and yes I made that point about casual players not necessarily equaling low level players at the discussion as well.  Not only that but I added that &quot;hard core&quot; players could have times in their life when they will play as &quot;casual&quot; players too so anything benefitting &quot;casual&quot; play is good for all players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadshade</div><div class="date">07-06-04, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all !<br />
<br />
I happened on this interesting thread and would like to add my 2c to the problem of a casual player and why this species is going to die out in EQ as it is .<br />
<br />
First let's make acquintance with a casual player - myself .<br />
My main has been created in june 1999 and is today level 63 with 9 AA .<br />
As casual as they go .<br />
<br />
One poster got the main problem very accurately whereas most didn't (couldn't ?) understand .<br />
It's all in the feeling .<br />
My first , what , 2 years of playing have been spent in wonder how big Norrath was , how many pleasant people there were and how difficult it was to survive .<br />
There was at the beginning ONLY the old world but even pre Kunark it has been HUGE .<br />
It has been even more huge because you had to go to most places on foot or use boats .<br />
However that feeling of immensity was alleviated by the fact that virtually in EVERY zone you could find helpful people .<br />
<br />
I remember my first run from Qeynos to Freeport .<br />
In every zone I had to stop and to ask my way .<br />
I still remeber that friendly barbarian who lead me through Highhold's maze warning that Kithicor could be my death .<br />
My heart was beating like never when at last I zoned from the dark , gloomy Kithicor to the sunny West Commonlands .<br />
Then a bit later appearing in the haze , the battlements of Freeport ...<br />
Boy , what a sight and what an adventure !<br />
<br />
Did stuff and loot matter ?<br />
Not at all !<br />
My first items with stats were the Cutthroats rings with DEX + 2 and how I was proud to have them .<br />
In every zone , and I stress EVERY , an ooc : &quot;Looking for group&quot; brought a half a dozen of tells .<br />
Sometimes there were lists (Treeants in S Karana or HH Keep , anybody ? :) ) but nobody waited long for groups wherever he wanted .<br />
Raids were an exception (Hate , Fear , Sky , the 2 dragons) , grouping , exploring and having fun was the rule .<br />
<br />
Kunark has been more of the same in a yet bigger world - first apparition of keys even though rather easy (Sebilis , Howling Stones and the inaccessible VP) .<br />
<br />
Velious has been the first turn in a bad direction with apparition of constraints (keys and level requirements) .<br />
<br />
I left then for a longer period and came back with Luclin .<br />
Norrath has then been no more the world I knew .<br />
Groups were hard to come by , raids going on everywhere , easily 90 % of the zones were empty and the 10 % left were not available to me either because of some key or because of my poor gear .<br />
People changed too - instead of that merry crowd shouting , grouping , dying and otherwise adventuring I found self centered players grimly bent on getting some Uber Necklace of Magnificent Selfhood and treating me &quot;Hey noob your stuff sucks&quot; .<br />
<br />
PoP was the beginning of the end for my kind of players .<br />
The already fast pace with Luclin became frenetic .<br />
Flags , trials , raids , DSPs , 65s all over the place , people 2 or 3 boxing (I even met a guy once in a full group in PoN who told me that all the 5 other characters were HIM 5 boxing !) .<br />
The fights took place in a glacial silence reduced to a well oiled routine - the guy actually didn't need me and didn't care if I was there or not .<br />
I was particularly shocked too when I heard that many people were calling their characters &quot;toons&quot; like if only numbers and items mattered .<br />
<br />
My small Guild where I have been for 3 years fell apart because those who could and would be on line every day and did at least 1 raid per week irreversibly distanced those who could not or would not .<br />
I can't catch those who got elemental and they won't group with me because the zones where I would go suck .<br />
<br />
LDoN was an attempt in the direction of casual players and I indeed appreciated it - as I play around 10 hours a week , I estimated that LDoN and trade skills could &quot;last&quot; me about 1 more year .<br />
But the frenesy won again - the few weeks after release there were easily 60 + players in BB at any given time , a group was done or found in a matter of minutes .<br />
Today ?<br />
Most probably already got anything that can be got in LDoN and many turn to hard LDoN now .<br />
So back to square 1 , groups are beginning again to be hard to find .<br />
Of course still easier as in the Grey , Sebilis or the Grieg's End but progressively harder .<br />
<br />
Look at any levelling guide today !<br />
It goes like that :<br />
1-5 newbie zone<br />
6-14 Crushbone<br />
15-22 Paludal<br />
23-38 HH<br />
39-48 DL<br />
49- 57 PoJ and PoI<br />
58 -65 PoV , BoT<br />
<br />
So that is the game ?<br />
From 1 to 65 in 2 months 10/24 , 7/7 and in 7 zones ?<br />
Everquest = 7 zones and then to rush to Time for those who have not enough ?<br />
<br />
The charity prevents me to mention GoD .<br />
<br />
So I have been long but what could be done about it ?<br />
Nothing !<br />
For the simple reason that the player base has changed over the years .<br />
It would be irrelevant to speculate if it was the players who changed the game or if it was the game that changed the players .<br />
It happened and it is irreversible .<br />
There was too much money invested in it , to change the concept now .<br />
The casual players will leave faster and faster untill either EQ stops for lack of players or untill it is centered on the hard core playing 7/7 and enjoying the race for items .<br />
<br />
In any case I will most probably be there no more to see what variant proved correct .<br />
The charm and the fun of EQ as it was for us has flown away so we'll have to look for another game that succeeds in it better .</div></div><hr />
