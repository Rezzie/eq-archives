<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">10-16-03, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so he has a rare genetic defect (Wilson's Disease) that affects only about 30,000 Americans out of some 3 billion... <br />
<br />
Ok, so he had a doctor that was incompetant and/or didn't care enough to send him to other doctors, as he had been testing for elevated liver enzymes over a four year period   , to determine what the cause was...<br />
<br />
Ok, so there was a point at which even a liver transplant might not have saved him...<br />
<br />
Ok, so now he needs to be on drugs to control the amount of copper in his body for the rest of his life so it doesn't reach toxic levels again...<br />
<br />
Ok, so he can't ever eat shellfish, salmon, or drink alcohol again unless he wants to commit suicide...<br />
<br />
But my DARLING (lying, theiving... see my previous rants) baby brother has just won a HUGE amount of money in a malpractice settlement - and gets $1,300 a month for the rest of his life in addition to a lump sum of about $200,000 - and this is after the lawyers get their cut.  And, now that he's working about 36.5 hours a week for $9/hr - that's just supplemental.  The monthly annuity payment would well take care of the monthly rent on an apartment - his job (his friend's father runs the mailroom at the local Jesuit university - so my brother now gets free tuition too) would keep him in food and cigarettes with no problem.<br />
<br />
And here I am, working my ass off, 40+ hours a week, just to make ends meet, and try to have a little bit of money left over for some fun, let alone have a bit to save up towards moving out on my own... I haven't even been able to afford (time/money) to go back to school to get my Bachelor's, so I'm pretty much stuck at this pay level with my Associate's, rather than being able to creep up into management level positions that pay much better.<br />
<br />
Jealous?   Maybe.  I had a serious health problem of my own (Hodgkin's Lymphoma) a year after his problems, but my doctors did a wonderful job of treating me and getting my life back to a relative normal state.  My job didn't lay me off while I was on disability even though they laid off 66% of my entire department (6 out of 9 were gone when I came back).  So, there was nobody to sue! :&quot;&gt; <br />
<br />
Now, I'm not looking for a handout from him - if he decides to give me some money as a gift, it's his own decision.  I'm not going to beg and grovel or treat him any differently than I have been treating him for the past 23 years.<br />

Well actually don't, I was in your seat once to.  I won't get into specifics because my brother reads this board too and its his personal info so if he wants he can talk more about it.<br />
<br />
But from my side of the story there times you have a hard time dealing with it, but you realize after awhile that he's had alot taken away from him that'll he'll never get back and the money he's gotten will never really replace what was taken from him from the mistreated care.  <br />
<br />
So there's times where I go damn i wish i had that, but I wouldn't trade working my ass off for what happened to his life + soem money.  And I know in a heartbeat he'd give the money back if he could get what was taken from him too.<br />
<br />

In this case, the doctor is lucky that he had insurance, because he was clearly in the wrong for not taking the time to actually care for his patients and question why blood tests kept coming back with bad results.  The doctor's answer to elevated liver enzymes on my brother's blood tests was that my brother was unusually large for his age - both height and weight.  (I think he was about 6' 4&quot;, about 300 lbs at that point - by the time he got into high school, he was a 6' 6&quot;, 325 lb. bruiser of an offensive lineman that enjoyed burying the defensive line in the mud.)  <br />
<br />
I also went to this doctor.  I don't think I ever spent longer than 5 minutes with that doctor - I'd hardly have walked in with a cough before I was being prescribed amoxicillin and going up to the desk to pay...<br />
<br />

Oh, I do focus on my own life, Nimm, it's just that he's made mine so miserable for the last year or so that I'm a bit ticked off at the universe for making his life rather comfortable at this point, while I still have to spend at least 40 hours a week at a very stressful job.<br />

Ok, lose my job when my random drug screening comes up, and move out into a cardboard box because I don't have any money saved up to move out... <br />

Good advice Geidon.    Very practical.<br />

I am not treating him any differently than I have in his entire life.  If he thinks that his money is going to make me kiss his ass and wait on him, he is terribly wrong.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Swipey...<br />
<br />
Back in Jan. of 2001, I actually did have quite a bit of money saved up, I decided I was going to put a down payment on a new car because my old car was falling apart, and had a few thousand dollars saved up, intending to move out a few months after that... I didn't take out disability insurance on my car loan, an important thing to note when taking a look at what happened shortly afterwards.<br />
<br />
And then in February of 2001, lightning struck - I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma - I was out on disability as of April 2001, and until I went back to work in March of 2002, I was living off of my short term, and later, long term disability, which wasn't nearly as much as my regular take-home, so I supplemented with my savings.  By the time I went back to work, my savings were gone due to car payments, medical co-pay (when you have to pay a $10 co-pay 1-4 times a week...), prescriptions (prescription plan only takes care of so much - was still spending at least $100 every 3 weeks on prescriptions), car &amp;amp; life insurance, etc.<br />
<br />
Since then, I've been struggling to save up money, but have not been able to get more than $500 ahead at any given point in time, at which point something always winds up happening that takes my money.  (like recently - I tell my mom that I really can't give my cousin more than $50 for his wedding, she gives me a dirty look like I'm a cheapskate, and she goes and gives him $400 and expects me to give her $200 of it!!)  <br />
<br />
Now, I help my mom out by paying half the rent, which went up to $1,000 a few months ago so that now I'm paying $500.  Car payments will be done next July, but until then, it's $525 a month... Oops, there goes the first of my 2 monthly paychecks... the other one goes towards paying phone, gasoline &amp;amp; car care, transportation &amp;amp; parking, food, medical, car insurance, life insurance, etc.<br />
<br />
Again, my rant is that I have a health problem too, one that could arise again and perhaps not be quite so easily put into remission (if you count a year of chemotherapy 3x a week as easy)... the only difference is that my doctors were great, there wasn't damned thing they did wrong, and I'm relatively healthy right now (albeit feeling a hell of a lot older than before chemotherapy)...<br />
<br />
I'm also pissed off that my brother makes light of the seriousness of my cancer, saying that it can't possibly have been as bad as what he went through, etc., and I'm really sick and tired of it.<br />
<br />
I'm torn in two because I feel that I should love my brother, and don't get me wrong, he has his moments where he is very loveable, but at the same time, I cannot stand to be near him...<br />
<br />
Oh, and Christmas is cancelled this year.  At most, I might be able to bake some cookies for folks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A new car and a serious illness (and the fact that Uncle Sam, in all his forms, probably takes a good 40% of your money too) accounts for it, all right.<br />
<br />
$47,000/year still sounds like a lot of money to us peons making only a smidge more than half that, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still hearing that your making 47k/year and spending it all month-to-month.<br />
<br />
And you'd have a lot easier time loving your brother, (and your coworkers too) if you'd stop blaming them for the misery you feel in your life.  I don't mean to point out the obvious, but some of that misery might be self induced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gyorg, you're right.  I should just start blaming you! :&quot;&gt; <br />
<br />
Heh...<br />
<br />
Remember though, that I don't write about the GOOD things that happen in my life in the RANT HALL... that wouldn't make for good rantage.  My rants are a completely one-sided account of those things that tick me off.  <br />
<br />
I'm really not all that miserable, I'm quite a happy person most of the time.  My posts here are just venting so that the little @#%$ that bugs me doesn't affect the rest of my life.  <br />
<br />
Of course, I have a flair for the melodramatic, so the little @#%$ looks like it encompasses my whole life when I write it here.</div></div><hr />
