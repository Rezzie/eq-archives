<br />
I have Barman Shanker with weapon chain in main hand, and Julie's dagger in offhand. Just not entirely sure what enchant to get for it. Money is not a problem, so any of the enchants are possible. Anyone got any firm opinions/previous experience about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underdawg Darogue</div><div class="date">06-05-05, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get lifestealer or crusader. Lifestealer is a nice purple glow that looks cool and also procs alot. Though most of the time you wont find yourself neeing the heal. Crusader procs alittle less often but the extra 100 atk power you get from the str is awesome and makes your hits land for more.<br />
<br />
Why do you use a weapon chain? Do you find yourself disarmed alot? Duel crusader enchants rock because th str will stack causing you to get 200 atk power.</div></div><hr />

Get a fiery enchant.  Lifestealing, if I remember correctly is 60 hp over 30 seconds,  you're not fighting anything but bosses for 30 seconds.<br />
If I'm wrong on the numbers, sorry.</div></div><hr />

Crusader has NO agro. Lifestealer does have alot of agro as it is a life tap. Lifestealer also is NOT 60 over 30 seconds. It is a 30 hp tap. that can often be partially or completely resisted. As crusader doesn't dmg or rely on the targets resists. It is never resisted. Fiery also is a good amount of agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">06-18-05, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">am I correct in saying that we don't get the same benifit of say a warrior, with a crusader proc? I know our attack is drawn from strength and agility, so by having a boost of 100 strength, is that the same level of attack a warrior would get by adding 100 strength? almost seems to overpower &quot;of the tiger&quot; gear that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underdawg Darogue</div><div class="date">06-19-05, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for rogues you get 1 atk power for each agi or str. Warriors I believe get 2 atk power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the most part the definative enchant combination for daggers seems to be <br />
+15 agility Offhand<br />
and<br />
+15 agility or +5 weapon damage Mainhand<br />
<br />
For swords... I have no idea, I would probably do either <br />
dual Crusader <br />
or <br />
Crusader mainhand and 15 agility offhand.<br />
<br />
Arguments for dual lifesteal on swords can be made if you PvP a lot, but for the raiding rog I would not suggest Lifestealing due to Mob abilities in AQ40 (Shadow reflect, Immunity, etc.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaolinz</div><div class="date">11-09-06, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're doing pvp with daggers then:<br />
<br />
MH: +5 dmg (or +4 dmg if you can't find the other)<br />
OH: +15 Agi<br />
<br />
or if you're broke<br />
<br />
Fiery on both works just fine, procs like mad.<br />
<br />
Crusader is overrated for pvp. You want static increases in pvp not something that has to proc. +dmg increases all your yellow damage. +agi increases all your damage, adds to dodge, crit, hit ect. as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-09-06, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know, Crusader does generate some amount of threat when it procs, above and beyond the increase in AP.<br />
<br />
And I don't get why Rogues like Fiery. The damage is not worth it, building threat on multiple mobs at once is never a good idea for a rogue, and it will break crowd control. It's very rare that I see a Rogue above 30 using fiery on my server. I guess because it's cheaper than getting any other enchant that is useful to rogues.<br />
<br />
Right now I do crusader on the main hand, life stealing on the offhand. I can't really decide which would be better to go on both weapons, but as time goes on I lean more and more towards Crusader. The mats are less of a pain to farm for as well.</div></div><hr />

The threat from the heal, I'm sure; all things considered, this is pretty negligable considering what you're already outputting to begin with.<br />
<br />
And I don't get why Rogues like Fiery.<br />
-Fiery- is a cheapo 40DD enchant with a 6PPM rate, which means it procs nigh-incessantly for a swords builds.  It's a good chunk of damage for drastically less than a Lifestealing or Crusader enchant, for the rogue on a budget.<br />
<br />
There's -another- enchant with a virtually identical name which is a one-use quest reward.  That one procs a low/negligable damage PBAE DoT, and is not only useless, but it's actively counterproductive.  I think that's the one you're thinking of.  =&gt;<br />

For what it's worth...if I recall from the last time I looked at the hard numbers, the difference between Crusader, Lifestealing, or +5 Dmg on mainhand was a scant few DPS one way or the other.  I'd definitely say to go with whichever one is A) easier to obtain for you and B) more fun.  Personally, I kinda prefer Crusader simply because it can't be resisted...but as Dagger-spec, I use +5 Dmg on my mainhand because I'm a big-numbers whore.  ;p</div></div><hr />

I think you may be mistaken with what fiery actually is. All fiery does is add DD when it procs (which it does often) to your target. There is no aoe-type affect with it, there is no DoT affect to it. Im not sure how it would break crowd contril unless you are directly attacking the mob that is crowd-controlled. <br />
<br />
Since I'm an enchanter, I had fiery and icy on my hunters two bone slicing hatchets for farming purposes. Fiery procs A LOT and adds a pretty decent amount of damage with a fast weapon. As far as end game rogues and Fiery vs. Crusader, Im not sure what is better. As a hunter the only interest i have in crusader is getting the recipe to drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do it mostly for the heal love. I would think the increased damage through AP applied to a crit would equal or maybe exceed the LS procs....but I'm not up for crunching digits to prove it. That and the LS effect when it procs is lame, so it doesn't really entice me as much as 100pnt heals and visible increases in damage.</div></div><hr />
