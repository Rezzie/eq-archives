<br />
and..<br />
<br />
I figured i'd ask you guys what your PK morals are...<br />
I've been anti since i started the charachter.. with a strict law of revenge (i /note everyone who kills me and print it every other day).. more and more i'm thinking of how fun it would be to become an assassin....<br />
<br />
I play on rallos zek, so i'd like to hear from more RZ players...<br />
<br />
So far my ideas have been only to kill gnome enchanters/necros/mages/wizards.. maybe high elves.. but that might give me a bit of a problem.. since i'm a gnome myself.. and there are alot of gnome pk's out there who take advantage of situations..<br />
<br />
any suggestions or explanations of your own morals would be great.<br />
<br />
thanks.. <br />

i generally kill any ToN, DB, etc members if i can.. but its the guild-tag-less morons who always get to me.. thanks for the advice</div></div><hr />

You don't really need any special morals or rules, just don't be a **** about'it. Tell'em it was a good fight and if you're feeling real nice just don't loot, or only take coin. You can be as evil and unfair as you want, just don't go down as a snot. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_MajestykVZ</div><div class="date">12-18-00, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread's pretty much a Rallos topic.  On the team servers, it is not to PK or not.  It is, who to PK.<br />
<br />
I've always wondered why those that claim to be anti-PK choose a PvP server. Majestyk, Rogue, Shanks, Vallon Zek!We as Shanks, have chosen the hard path. In the hardness of it, is where we find the glory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">12-18-00, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well just as in real life you can kill anyone (technically), you don't. Do you ask a cop why he doesn't kill people randomly when he has a gun strapped to his belt? No, because he is against crime and only uses his weapons at hand to stop it, not to initiate it.<br />
<br />
If I played on a team server, there is no way I'd be anti-pk, but RZ and TZ/VZ are completely different worlds. If I got PK'ed by another race I'd assume that the guy was RP'ing, and I'd have some fun trying to hunt him down (plus he didn't take my items). On Rallos when I get PK'ed, I almost always know it's simply for the fact the guy knew he could gank me and loot an item.<br />
<br />
We are not anti-pvp, we are anti-pk; there is certainly a difference.<br />

3 teams on sight.  Halfing, elve, gnome, dark elf, they are all the same.  Some try to say evil races should die first, that is just stupid thinking.  Everyone must die and they must die now, and I wll be the one to kill them.<br />

There I was killing a wolf and then i would turn around and ...bam.. dead.   <br />
I tried the pvp team server and it was alot better i think.  The fact anyone can kill you on Rallos is i guess more realistic but i thought it was a pain in the butt.<br />
When is enough, enough and people stop killing a level 2 and loot there only tunic and only decent items.  <br />
We'll before anyone says &quot;Then dont play on a pvp then&quot; i have already decided not to go on this server.  <br />

Someone will shout.. &quot;Welcome to Rallos Zek&quot;.. what this really means is.. &quot;Welcome to ten levels of hell&quot;<br />
once you escape level 10, or sometimes level 15, you're bascially in a whole new world.. you've most likely left your newbie area.. and you're really entering &quot;Rallos Zek&quot;.. where if you see a person in full bronze bothering you.. 5 of your guild mates jump out of the bushes and whack him.. quite fun =)</div></div><hr />
