<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sickle</div><div class="date">02-03-06, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you interested in joining a mixed pve/pvp clan then look no further because Deliverance of Defeat is now recruiting any committed person that is interested in joining. We have a lot of nice ideas that you can read up on at our offical website which can be found at http://sickle14.tripod.com/ just step up an account and take a gander at the site and our forums.You can post and find things out that you would like to be answered on a higher level Or you can im me on aim where I can answer your questions right away.<br />
<br />
Deliverance of Defeat is a clan that goes beyond the game. We throw away the need to communicate through typing by allowing hands free communication. This clan, led by myself and my bro strife, understands the need of teamwork for a game such as this. We both hope to have a strong bond with all of our members and thats why we would like to have this clan going before the game is released. As my bro said said, you can check out our official site and we encourage suggestions and tips to make the site along with our forums even better. Upon release, Deliverance of Defeat will take full swing into this game and we would like to have as many COMMITTED members to help out. If you have any questions at all just go check out our forum site at http://deliveranceofdefeat.forumsplace.com/ and please register before posting so we could get to know you better. You can also IM me or strife on AIM, my s/n is crazyman0129 and strife is ugaplaya89. One of the two of us will always be online but if we are away, feel free to leave a message and we'll get a hold of you as soon as we can. We would be more than happy to answer any questions you have relating to our clan and its purposes.<br />
<br />
We are about letting our members enjoy themselfs, we are about creating a family and good relationships between our Leaders, Elites, and members. Everyone is treated and looked at the same way no matter what you are. We are just looking for the committed/dedicated members. We like to have fun but yet like to play the game. As I like to say hardcore playing with fun times thrown in with the guild. And please stay tuned we have a lot of fresh new ideas and they will probably be released when vgsoh is closer to coming out on our official forums first.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time spent reading this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sickle</div><div class="date">02-11-06, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I figured I would stop by and tell you guys that a lot has gone on since my last post. We have customized a DKP into our own system which can be found on our forums. We are also narrowing down where we are going to start our journey. Even though our journey has already started recruiting poeple. Our journey will never be complete because we will always be recruiting those special people just like us. Please stop by our website and forums.Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sickle</div><div class="date">02-11-06, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah.....Before I forget you must register to the forums to post it doesn't seem like people are realizing this, so I am just making sure that you guys know. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sickle</div><div class="date">02-13-06, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The journey all started in the summer months of the year 2005. When two brothers came together within their minds and souls. But before they created this guild, they delibarated for hours on end thinking of the best for there guild. After about two months of delibarating they came up with in their opinion the best for their guild. You now know them as the leaders of Deliverance of Defeat. They have fought together in many journeys in other fantasy worlds, now they have started a new journey. Where now they have to make new fellowships within another fantasy world.<br />
	It is now in the year 2006 and since the year 2005 Deliverance of Defeat has come far in such a short time. They have put down a foundation with their systems. Their system range from their new customized DKP system to their mvp system. Yes, thats right they customized a DKP into a GEP system which stands for Guild Event Points. Then there is their Elite system where the guilds most committed/dedicatied companions are ranked upon. There is also their team system where six to eight man teams will be set up in a balanced matter, unless a team is going to focus on one sphere within the team. These teams will be lead by two captains. The captains will be selected by a vote. When all the delibaration happened between these two brothers, one of the many things they came up with that they wanted to become a democracy. Where all issues are voted upon within a council, which is made up by the leaders and elite companions. They have became this today. Well they also have their monthly mvp which is basicly where a companion sticks out from all other companions in that month and is selected as their mvp award for that month.<br />
	These brothers have been around mmo's for years, it has been six years for both of them. One has lead guilds for six years and the other has lead with his brother along his side for four years. These guys are all about getting to know every man/woman they come in concact with. Their guild is all about becoming a strong family guild, because after all the leaders of Deliverance of Defeat are brothers. Well guys I think I have summed it up for you. Thanks.<br />
	My brother had posted this on our forums. This is probably the best way of what we are that I have seen yet. Here it is.<br />
	DoD is going to be different from most clans because it is going to be controlled by two leaders with one goal in mind. Upon release we are going to be a hardcore PvE building up supplies and expanding our territories. My bro and I are going to both hold up equal leadership within the clan. Our clan is also going to be a variety of different players consisting of both hardcore and casual players. Hardcore players will be able to get more out of the clan as they will move up in rank and hold more authority within the clan. As for myself, being one of the leaders, i will be playing hardcore putting many hours in. As for right now we do not have any official allies yet but we are starting to make friends between guilds. I do believe that having a few strong allies could be a terrific idea, forming one community hall for trading and such. More discussion will be needed to take place between my brother and I before i can make any final say so. Right now we are trying to focus on recruiting official members to take part on our journey to success. Me and my brother both think alike when it comes to leadership and ideas to make a stronger clan. We are looking for players who would be willing to make the commitment from the start to hasten our goals for our clan. Those such goals are as follows: A caravan started- For now there hasnt been any official release on what exactly will be needed for such a thing but it is a top priority to keep the clan moving as a whole. A city- this probably the biggest of our goals, but we believe that is essential to have for a great clan to grow and prosper. Water Transport- Not only will we be able to travel across oceans, but we would also be able to fairy people across to help bring in an income for the clan. Rewards- To some this may seem like a feeble goal, but i believe it is important to give back to those members who have helped so much. This is going to be done through giving gold, items, weapons, armor, and eventually even some land. <br />
	Thanks for your time once again and be safe. And once again you can find us at http://sickle14.tripod.com/ and our forums at http://deliveranceofdefeat.forumsplace.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sickle</div><div class="date">02-15-06, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as some of my first post(s) may state that DoD would be starting on a PvE server. Since then things have changed and we will be starting on a PvP server, due to the fact that I think everyone but my brother perfers to start on a PvP. But don't get me wrong my brother will PvP if he has to but he would rather play PvE. This as of right now will never change. So if we have referred to PvE please now note that it should be PvP. But starting on a PvP server doesn't change anything that we stand for by any means. We still are going to stick to everything, just going to start on a PvP server that is all. Sorry for any inconvenience, guess it is all part of tweaking before the game is actually out better now then after release I guess. Sorry again guys, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sickle</div><div class="date">03-02-06, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tired of chasing after Leaders of guilds through forums and emails?!? Here at DoD we have decided to start opening up live chats. Yes, these chats will be live with one, if not both, of our Leaders. We will have open live chats on Wednesdays starting at 9Pm eastern time and ending around 12-1Am eastern time. All you need to do is IM either Crazyman0129 (Sickle) or Ugaplaya89 (Strife) on AIM to join in on the chats. During that time you will be able to ask your questions and get your response all at once. We hope this new technique will allow those who are interested to get to know us along with our guild as all topics will be open for discussion. Thanx again for your interest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sickle</div><div class="date">04-14-06, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off I would like to state that we will be starting on a PvP server and that is where we will stay for out our entire journey through Vanguard: Saga of Heroes. Also this is our About Us page were most of all the information you need about what we are about can be found.<br />
	We are Deliverance of Defeat and we would like to welcome you to our site. This is where we will discuss who we are, what is important to us and what we plan to do in the world of Telon which is the world for Vanguard: Saga of Heroes.<br />
	We are a guild that has been formed by two brothers with one goal in mind, we formed together on October 1, 2005 in the hopes of putting together a combination family/raid oriented guild for Vanguard. After two months of my brother Greg and I Bruce delibarating for hours on end brain storming where guilds we knew failed and where they have succeeded. We both have, along with our companions have come from a long history of MMORPG's. We are a determined group of mature players who for quite some time have been searching for a game that can keep us satisfied with not only it's playability but also its immersiveness.<br />
	One of our main objectives for the guild in Vanguard is going to be having fun. We have a great game coming our way, and a great group of people to jump into it with. But along the way in many guilds we have seen, people feel it is their job to achieve something by a certain point in time. Or grind to level 50 without stopping to enjoy the scenery. If all work and no play is what you enjoy, we won't stop you. But not for one second do we wish of you to believe you owe us 'work.' It's a game in which all different types of players deserve to enjoy. All our players' styles will vary, we can assure you that. We have casual players, and hardcore players, along with some in between; and on a whole other spectrum we have Adventurers, Diplomats, and Crafters.<br />
	A good portion of the guild will of course be our casual players, and so recruiting will most likely be the same. We accept anyone that is mature enough to be part of our guild and agrees to our terms. As of right now there is a brief waiting period of a few days for us to look over your application and getting votes from the guild. In this time period we would like for you to get to know the guild.<br />
	From the point of becoming a companion you will have a choice. If you choose to remain a casual player you need not worry about further advancement. If you are more of a hardcore type player, you may wish to seek further enrichment of the guilds structure. This would give you the option of trying out for a high ranking, or giving a request to the guild council in which asks for you to be evaluated for the ranking you have asked for.<br />
	Not joining a team in no way, shape, or form makes you any less valuable to our guild. No matter how casual of player you are, if you have become a member of our grand guild, you are an asset to our team. When contemplating whether or not you should apply, be sure to remember that there is a place for everyone within our walls.<br />
	Deliverance of Defeat has a simple yet diverse table of organization that was created by the Greg and I. From highest rank to lowest rank (Leaders/Elites/Team Captains/Companions/Recruits). All these ranks will be listed in detail below.<br />
	Leaders-This will only be Greg and myself at anytime. Our job it to keep everything running smoothly and to set an example for the rest of the guild. We make up some of the council.<br />
	Elites-This is were our most committed/dedicatied companions will be rank under. This is the highest rank for any companions within the guild. Elites make up the rest of the council. Also if you are an elite you will also be a team captain since we will need each team to be represented by one elite within the team to get the information out to their team. We would also like for the elite to give us a report on how well his team is or if things need to be changed up within the team.<br />
	Team Captain-This is where most of our trustworthy and knowledgable companions will most likely be statused under if they are not under elite status. The team captains will be the leader of their team along with the other captain since we feel that two captains per team is nessicarly.<br />
	Companions-This were most of our casual players will fall under. They will not be asked of much but just to follow the rules within the guild.<br />
	Recruits-These are people that are interested in the guild but have not yet been evaluated by the council.<br />
	We have also created our own DKP system which can be found here on our forums http://deliveranceofdefeat.forumsplace.com/message60.html you can also find our rules on our forums we would like for you to read these rules which can be found here http://www.deliveranceofdefeat.forumsplace.com/message77.html before you fill out an application which you can also can fill out here http://www.deliveranceofdefeat.forumsplace.com/message52.html<br />
	Our long term plans in Vanguard include many things, building ships, personal homes for the members, possibly a guild town. We'll also do our best to help members set up their own personal enterprises. This is also important because due to the size of Telon players will have restraints on where they can go due to time spent online and the time it takes to travel there. So if there is a player who wants to go ahead and set up a distributing business or possibly build their own ship and start a shipping business. Many things will be possible in the world of Telon.<br />
	We also do have a requirement for all members that if they are wanting to be part of the family that they should not be complete alt hounds. We understand the want to play an alt when you need a break from your main char or when your squad isn't on but that does NOT mean you should play every class/race combo to level 20 before trying to go higher. We're looking for dedicated players who take pride in their main and spend the majority of their time on that character.<br />
	So if you are interested in being part of our little family feel free to go ahead and drop by our forums to say hi and feel free to go ahead and fill out our recruiting application. Which can be found here http://deliveranceofdefeat.forumsplace.com/<br />
