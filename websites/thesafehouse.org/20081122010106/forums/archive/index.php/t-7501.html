<br />
My choices look to be rogue, which is my prime on a different server, or and ikky monk. I heard monks are insane in PvP, but I like the rogue class, I'm just not sure how it would fare in the PvP enviorment.. ya know?<br />
<br />
If you guys and gals could give me any feedback, it would be much appreaciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only thing that can really bring me down is a warrior or monk in a fungal tunic....freaking joust forever.<br />

(unless you are dueling) Swift, crontrolled movement is your life.  You have to position yourself for your backstab, which is your big weapon.  No other class has to be in a specific relation to thier target to do there max damage, you do.<br />
<br />
Circle strafe around them or run past them and pivot.  However you do it, you've got to get into that 180 degree area behind thier shoulders to land your backstab. Majestyk, Rogue, Shanks, Vallon Zek!We as Shanks, have chosen the hard path. In the hardness of it, is where we find the glory.</div></div><hr />

I saw the guards crown ya fer tryin' out their pockets.  Then the monk and I chased ye around, me pokin' yer backside, until ye finally fell to me blades.<br />
<br />
So what if I don't have a prayer in the world of bringin' ye down single-handed.  I got me screenshot of killin' ya and I'm holdin' on to it! har har<br />

It's the same thing as dueling. The thing about PvP, is you can never really be prepared. Don't count on it or stay on the blue servers. Rogues are great because 'prepared' or not they can pull all sortsa little tricks out of their bag. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_malwae</div><div class="date">06-12-01, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to be on a PvP server just to kill people and don't want to mess with spells, I think I'd say that monks seem to overall have better success at PvP in general than rogues, possibly because of their Mend ability.  If you are willing to plow through to lvl 50 as a rogue, I think you will have an advantage over the monks.  Rogues in general seem like much more fun to play, though, if you want to have fun at stuff other than PvP in the 1-50 levels, I'd go for a rogue.  Running past some lighty fighting a hill giant, and instead of attacking and possibly xp killing them, instead targeting the giant and taking 30 pp of the loot the lightie was about to get, has got to be one of the most rewarding EQ experiences I've ever had.</div></div><hr />
