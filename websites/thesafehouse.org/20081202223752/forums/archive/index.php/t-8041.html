<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Faegin Darkfang</div><div class="date">10-10-02, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that you can actually turn a profit making poisons and selling them back to the vendor from about skill level 180 on.<br />
<br />
If you're willing to click your wrist off, I discovered that Spirit of Sloth is an amazing poison to make for the purposes of getting to and going beyond the 200 mark.<br />
<br />
I took 2k out of the bank and decided to get my poison making up to my cap (I was 53 at the time with a 179 skill and could go up to 215).  I was &quot;warmly&quot; faction in FV (thanks to countless drolvarg teeth) and had a 132 CHA with all &quot;look I'm a cute halfling&quot; gear on.  I swapped out my &quot;cute gear&quot; for high dex, agi, wis, and int stuff when I was actually making the poisons.<br />
<br />
I bought all the ingredients from the vendor (Creeper Ivy, Ethereal Susp, and Sealed Vials) and started clicking.<br />
<br />
At first, I was losing money.  Below 200 skill, my success rate for SoS was about 40 percent, but the sell back value is quite high for this poison, so I lost money pretty slowly.  And I was getting reasonable success.<br />
<br />
When I hit 200 skill, I had lost around 1 k.  <br />
<br />
After 200, my success rate increased noticeably.  I'd say it ran around 60 percent.  And my money started to increase.  By 215 (my cap at 53rd), I had a little over 2100pp.  I had increased my skills, and made 100pp to boot!<br />
<br />
Now, every level, I go back to FV, grab some cash and head over to pop my Make Poison skill up the 5 points to its new cap.  And everytime, I put more money in the bank than I originally pulled out.<br />
<br />
Now, before anyone starts screaming &quot;exploit&quot;, be aware that this profitable method of skill increase takes ALOT of clicking.  I mean ALOT.  If you are prone to CTS, go use training points with Stanos in HH.<br />
<br />
Oh and incidentally, how much are people getting for Mind Melts on their server?  I gathered some ingredients and after 10 attempts managed 2 vials of the stuff... and sold them for a tidy 2k each.  I think the guys that bought from me were desperate, but far be it for this rogue to turn away a wheelbarrow full of platinum if someone offers it... heheh<br />

<br />
I'm not sure what the going rate on Mind Melts is because I've never actually &quot;sold&quot; them. I believe I've given people a break though. Several times I've gotten tells from folks asking if I could make it...... They provide all the components and I rent out my skill.... I made 8 for one guy and charged him 1Kpp. If I had to go farm the stuff myself it would be more along the lines of 1Kpp each. Runehammer Trollsbane<br />

<br />
And yeah, it's a hell of a lot of clicking considering the selling back part requires clicking each made poison and then clicking 'sell' to sell back. -- Squink McPoke, 60 Assassin, Lanys T'vyl. Hat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mugwump C</div><div class="date">10-11-02, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, i do the same, making my sos and selling them back, i'm lvl 57 now, and maxed for my lvl, making sos since i was at 200 to upgrade my skill.<br />
though to move my skill from 60 to 200, i spent about 4k, so if we make some profit now, you can't call it an exploit with all the money that was spent earlier..</div></div><hr />

I just don't make it a point to come in here and try to wade through a 6 page uber bumped post before I throw in a suggestion.  If I did that, I'd probably never have the time to post... lol  Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that strutsand frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more...Faegin Darkfang - Master Rogue of the 54th CircleGrossmund Zhmalbehr - Dwarven Warrior of 30 CampaignsBloodywolf - Beast Lord of The Tribunal for 10 WintersPestilentia - Greenblood Ogress with 22 Crushed-SkullsTorwin - Priest of Bristlebane of the 15th RiteSnoggin - Ranger of the Thicket for 15 SummersTrouveres - Elven Troubador of the 10th Verse</div></div><hr />

So getting grandmaster didnt cost me anything.. Not bad way to get skill ups.<br />
<br />
Im now a Grand master with a Grandmaster Assassin vial and posion mastery 1. I wanted to find out if this could be used to make me rich. I rarely fail on SoS (About 1 fail in 40 trys). In 1 hour of eye bleeding combines I made 554 PP. Not bad but not worth it, I can make better money other places.</div></div><hr />
