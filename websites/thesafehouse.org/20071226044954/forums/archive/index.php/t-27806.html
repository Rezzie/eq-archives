<br />
Hi there... <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that many of you aren't enjoying my interpretation of Renji. I know it's caused quite a stir and has become quite a topic of controversy, but I think as the series goes on you'll embrace him more. Because as the series has gone on I've learned to embrace him more. I really think you'll start to enjoy him as the show progresses.<br />
<br />
I know that I don't sound like the original Japanese guy, but you should know a few things...<br />
<br />
1) When auditioning for a show like this, voice references of the original Japanese actors are not given to us. We are not encouraged in any way to try and sound like them. (In fact, many times it's discouraged) These are being dubbed for an AMERICAN audience, and we are instructed to portray them as such. We are encouraged to create new takes on the characters. That's what makes the two versions so uniquely different and enjoyable in their own way. Instead of comparing one to the other, it's the hopes of the staff that the diversity in the casts will be celebrated.<br />
<br />
2) I believe the producers (in my opinion) thought that the voice artist who did the Japanese version of Renji sounded too old. I believe (in my opinioin) the reason I was cast was to &quot;young him up&quot; for an American audience. When I went into read for the role, the description was something like &quot;young, angry guy with an attitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
3) Sometimes during the sessions, we listen to the Japanese track, but only to get timings. Or maybe we want to hear how lightly or loudly the Japanese actor made a sound. Other than that, I believe the producers are not interested in sounding like the Japanese actor at all because, again, this is being created for an entirely different audience than the fans of the Japanese versions.<br />
<br />
4) I was told once that the majority of the anime fans who watch English versions have never seen the Japanese versions at all. Nor will they probably ever. The number I heard was something like 6% of their viewers have ever seen the original Japanese versions.<br />
<br />
5) American fans who become fans of the series as it's being presented here, may someday dig out the original Japanese versions. And when they hear the original voices, they may have the same reaction you did, but in reverse. &quot;That's not how Renji should sound.&quot; You see, it's all a matter of conditioning.<br />
<br />
6) In regards to the pronunciations, we are told EXACTLY how to say it by the director and producer. We have a reference CD that we listen to for exact pronunciations, and the producers will sometimes send it back and have us redo it if we haven't gotten it completely right. The actors have no leeway whatsoever in how they pronounce certain words. It all comes down to us from above.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for listening. And I hope you can still enjoy the English version of &quot;Bleach.&quot; I know we're having a whole lot of fun doing it for you.<br />

He seems fine to me - his lines could be better but that's the writer's job, not the actor's.<br />
<br />
I think too many people assume an english voice actor in an anime should be a 'voice impersonator', trying to get as close to the original japanese actor.  I disagree with that train of thought - I think it's better for an actor to get his own feel for a character and run with it rather than just try to mimic another actor's work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
4 &amp; 5 are ******** and he knows it.<br />
<br />
As far as voice goes. Ok fine you don't have to sound exactly like the Japanese VA but atlest put ******* effort into your VA ability.<br />
<br />
Thats why most of the Japanese VAs do well is b/c the studio or themselves put a LOT of effort into what they do while english studios or VA's themselves put little to NO effort...<br />
<br />
Note: Have not seen the english renji yet this is more general english VA rant...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doing a japanese impersonation, in english?  It never works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this is the first time someone actually in the industry has outright said they're trained to NOT sound like the original VAs. <br />
<br />
This is done mostly by omission, rather than a specific piece of direction. The fact that they never play us voice tracks of the original guys before auditioning speaks volumes, in that I believe they really don't care that much what the original guy sounds like. All this shows me that a match is not a very high priority with them, nor is it a very high priority for the majority of the US audience.<br />
<br />
Like any producer or director, they're going to want to put their own unique thumbprint or stamp on their version. And I believe that their very wise in doing so. Why just copy what's already been done? The original Japanese version will always be available for those who want it.<br />
<br />
Considering that the overwhelming majority of those who watch the show in the US have absolutely no idea what the original guy sounds like (nor would they care) I think the producers are very smart creating the show with a specifically American audience in mind and &quot;making it their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd be happy to answer any other questions posted here about the anime process, as the dubbing business really is quite fascinating.<br />
<br />
Strange thing is...I'm sure that there are Japanese &quot;Family Guy&quot; fans somewhere out there who are complaining that the Japanese voice artist who dubbed my characters for the Japanese audience, doesn't sound as good as the English version. ha ha ha. <br />

Ah, so that's who we have to blame for &quot;Itchygo&quot; and &quot;ROOkya KOOTCHki.&quot;</div></div><hr />
