(I have Both Hover and TP friend, so I have prereqs for both of them.)<br />
<br />
I know from a Game mechanics Point of view, Teleport is faster, eats more END and is harder to control while Flight is slower, less END draining and very easy to control.<br />
<br />
Either one would fit my character concept pretty well, and I can see how both would be useful in several ways.<br />
<br />
From the &quot;This power kicks ass!&quot; point of view, what do you have, and do you like it?<br />
<br />
(Of course, Leapers and SS folks are more thanw elcome to chime in too..)<br />
<br />
Edit: because theres a big difference between Hover and Teleport and I'm a dumbass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantom Rogue</div><div class="date">05-06-04, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Super Jump and SuperSpeed are the two fastest.<br />
<br />
Teleport needs a ton of range enhancers to be worth it<br />
<br />
Flying is cool just because its flying<br />
<br />
I have Flying on one, Teleport on another and Super Jump on a third.  Out of them, I like Jump the best cause its fast, Fly second and Teleport third (i just hate the cast time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-06-04, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nightprowl got Super Jump yesterday and I was having a ball with it, jumping through Steel Canyon and King's Row.  You don't jump extremely high (maybe five or six stories), but you jump far and quick.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure whet you mean by hover is faster and flight is slower though; hover's the slow moving one you can take at six; my defenders take it because of hover's defensive bonus during battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-06-04, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">after testing to the mid twenties and several toons to the mid teens my favorite combo was teleport with hover. You leave hover on while you port so you don't get teh sliding effect, and when you run out of endurance you can hover and recover some instead of falling for lots of damage, potentially into a nest of thugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't jump extremely high (maybe five or six stories)<br />
<br />
Thats pretty ****ing high!<br />
<br />
Myself, I'll be getting jumping and speed since I'm playing a magical ninja.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jump, so far until people get SO flight enhancers is the fastest, and drains almost 0 end when your traveling. I can race teleporters flyers and even superspeeders and win. While you can't jump as high as you can hover / fly, you can &quot;climb&quot; with jumping it takes some practice but theres really no building you can't reach the top of with super leap. As a scrapper / tanker i would say the jump line is very essential becuase combat jumping is another thing you can slot the beejesus out of for Dmg reduction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Superjump is amazingly fun... its also very deceptive, because if you jump straight up you don't feel like your moving very quickly... however, if you jump straight out you haul butt.  Works fine even under lag.  Toggles beautifully between Combat Jump and SJ, takes zilch endurance so you can keep one or the other up all the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Teleport is nice, and faster than Jump (as long as you don't have to wait for end to recharge).  Its also badly effected when a lagspike hits.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went with super speed.<br />
<br />
I can stack with Prestige Power, Swift and Superspeed.  <br />
<br />
Crazy fast.<br />
<br />
With force field I can go anywhere and with superspeed it makes it that much easier.  Thinking of adding stealth since my speed will override the slowdown.<br />
<br />
All the powers are cool, I highly reccomend that at lvl 6 and 14 to take travel powers.  They make the game much easier since half the time you are running around the city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Super jump is a horrible power to take.  Once you take it you'll be level 14 for at least a week while you spend gleeful hours jumping around tall buildings and generally going &quot;Wheeeeee!&quot; for hours at a time.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I didn't get a bit of experience for over a day after the first time I got super jump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyssa</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't had time to play much so I'm not even close to travel powers yet, but in closed beta I had flight and absolutely LOVED it.  I wouldn't go any other way.  Although my alt, a scrapper is taking super leap.  That should be interesting and fun too.  But flight's my favorite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-08-04, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ended up going with Teleport. Over short distances its very fast, until you start running low on END.<br />
<br />
But oh man, its fun as hell. I could spend hours just flying around with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really enjoy hover, it's so nice to float over walls and stuff (err i mean desperately try to inch up them). I like using it for sniping too hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I have no idea how much XP debt I've already prevented with Recall Friend. At least a couple dozen deaths, I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Fly to the flight ceiling and recall friends who don't have Hover or Fly ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Since you can't die from falling damage you just get to see them go to 1 hitpoint hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or just put them on top of the Atlas Statue.<br />
<br />
Sure, it doesn't injure them, but its funny watching them try and figure out how to get down safely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And everyone knows you can scale the sides of buildings with windows just my jumping facing the wall from window to windows right? sometimes it's faster than taking the fire escapes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anastas</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took super speed when I hit 14 and I have not regretted it.  I enjoy speeding around town. one thing I did notice and have heard about as well is that Super speed gives a hefty defense bonus when on. I did test this and I believe its a little too much defense ( my opinion ). Now I did not take it for the reason of defense, but I could see someone exploiting the fact that your defense goes up so much when its activated, now granted you can also not hit anything since your accuracy is debuffed by a good margin as well.  <br />
<br />
Example I was level 14 and I went to Talos Island just to check things out with superspeed active I was letting level 24 mobs beat on me and just watching them whiff. Now eventually I was hit for a hundred or two and was forced to speed away.<br />
<br />
Also Kroe has a point about scaling buildings and here is my 2 cents on that. I have hurdle and with hurdle I can scale buildings fast. I mean real fast.  Now many medium sized buildings have small ledges denoting stories. All you have to do is jump up one story and hit that small ledge ( hurdle will get me there, not sure about other powers ) and just jump up one story with each jump while holding forward of course.<br />
<br />
Anyway sorry about the lengthy post but its my 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those King's row rooftop missions are annoying me. By the time I get to the top of the roof, it never fails that some high flyer took out everyone there even though they vastly outlevel the enemies. bah. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the recall friend, i think they should add a message box asking for consent before being ported. There have been a couple times i'll join a group, find its one person, and before i know it, im recalled 3490572390457 feet in the air, and will land on a group of mobs ready to eat my remaining 1 hit point. Other than that its a very useful tool, a mega + to groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That should be considered a bannable offense, IMHO.<br />
<br />
My problem with a Confirmation box, is that would remove the ability to use it in-combat.<br />
<br />
Maybe have a setting so that Either alllows Ports and Resses Never/Confirmation/Always/Only to people on your friends List or Supergroup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note<br />
<br />
<br />
The times I did it... I was in group and on the phone with the person during the rikti invasion in Beta.... he was trying his best to get to the tram.... and damnit we both laughed our butts off.<br />
<br />
<br />
So no harm no foul from me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">he defense buff for superspeed was adjusted on the patch, which I believe is currently being repatched hehe.<br />
<br />
And if you get a guy who is inviting you int oa group and porting you like that petition them. chances are they will be spoken too. personally thoguh I rarely accept team invites unless I know the people, but then i was one of teh first people taking hover and teleport so I could get high enough to really drive one of my teammates insane. he never took a travel power so he was pretty much always at my mercy hehe. Beta was fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryna</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How exactly does teleport work?<br />
<br />
Like how do you choose where to go? (Never had a chance to buy it yet, and it's one of the things I'm considering)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Never have to deal with enemies while traveling<br />
2. Pretty darn speedy<br />
3. With a single end redux DO, endurance use is minimal<br />
4. Easy access to rooftops<br />
5. Hover defense bonus</div></div><hr />

<br />
This means if you fully slot your travel power, teleport will win by a large margin for fastest travel.<br />
<br />
At the base it's still fast over short distances, but it has an extra use in that you can use it while rooted. Situational sure, but it's an unique benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plus, It instantly gets you out of range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The endurance cost is high, but slotted with a DO end reducer makes it liveable.<br />

One important thing about using teleport though is an appropriate keybind. <br />
Currently, I am using button4 to activate the power which makes it a whole lot more convenient than trying to work with it out of the tray.<br />

Also Try binding it to left shift key + Left Mouse Button. That works really well if you don't have extra mouse buttons, and less likely to accidentally hit it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they do... however you can do some single pulls using it much like Sniper attacks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
But essentially long range attacks work a lot like they do in EQ... ie: if you get a wanderer who is far enough out from his group and hit him at the right instant the rest can be out of assist range.<br />
<br />
So he comes solo</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It is handy to bind a key to &quot;unselect$$enemy_near&quot;<br />
I am not sure not the exact bind,  I can post the correct syntax later.<br />
This will automatically select the target closet to you.<br />
<br />
Another thing, if you kill/pull/atk the bosses or lieutentats first, depending on the type of villian, the minions wont agro.(ie:vhaz)</div></div><hr />
