He's been around since Pen and Paper days. He even posted on SGO that he does own Aradune and will do with him what he pleases. <br />
<br />
I like how he's using him as a segue between *cough* &quot;lives&quot; *cough*. It tells me he's taking ownership for the project and bringing a bit of tradition into a new milieu.<br />

He's just a sentimental old sod like myself- Nocte's been around since circa 1979/1980</div></div><hr />

Haven't spent a lot of time on it, but I suspect that it's likely to be some computer-related thing that we accountants just don't get</div></div><hr />

Except for those odd numbers, which could just be something entirely random and unrelated, i don't see how there is any puzzle in here.

<br />
Edit: Okay, now I sorta see the puzzle here, but it's gonna be tough to figure out with out much to go on.  Anyone a cryptographer in their spare time? Edited by: Thwick  at: 3/12/04 11:29 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">03-12-04, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Made a change on the hint site, I assumed it was one poem translated, the original art, however, was labeled &quot;verse1 and verse2&quot; (credit: Gilgalon for the idea). It may be insignificant, but didn't want to miss anything by mislabling.<br />
<br />
Also added other URLs discovered by members of the Sigil Forums (credit: Kiranth). Supposedly there is one more that a few claim to know, but won't divulge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Garthilk</div><div class="date">03-14-04, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I particularly like the dwarf poem.  The most recent barbarian one is intresting though.  Also while the number seems to be getting small, the ease in which to decipher it isn't getting any bigger.  So the dwarves build a huge dam, and the barbarians went into the icy north to slay a creature.<br />

<br />
Anyone getting else get a distinct feeling of Robert E Howard? The limited lore we've seen so far just smacks of Hyboria. It's been awhile since reading the novels, but:<br />
<br />
 » The game's title would suit the Conan epics<br />
<br />
 » Aradune's shift into a new existance just screams Crom!<br />
<br />
 » Ace Publishing is reprinting the Hyborian Conan novels this year as well a releasing 3 new non-Conan novels conforming to the Hyborian continuity.<br />
<br />
 » The much ballyhooed &quot;Conan 3&quot; Motion Picture is rumored to begin production this summer.<br />
<br />
 » The Conan lore is expansive, from the original stories, to the multiple publishers' development of the dynasty, to fan fic- There is an established milieau to drop a game engine on.<br />
<br />
 » While an new RPG &quot;Conan&quot; video game does exist, Conan fans are as rabid as trekkies or Star Wars geeks. <br />
<br />
This of course is all conjecture and musing on my part but DAMN, this would be a merchandising/marketing goldmine, and the stars seem to be in alignment for this to happen. I'd love to be a rogue in Conan's world. Think of all the camels we could punch out &quot;just because&quot;.</div></div><hr />

/yawn<br />

Anyone know of some intersting rpgs coming up? Oh, and Elric is no fun either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zulian</div><div class="date">03-15-04, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Elegy, Conan would be pretty lame.<br />
But I don't see it being Conan, I'm betting on an original world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-16-04, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote:13.3 Will you attempt to make distant lands really feel distant?<br />
<br />
    Yes, Telon is huge with all different sizes of landmasses. Travel between lands will take some time, but the travel in and of itself should be fun.<br />
<br />
Found that while rifling through the FAQ for stuff I'll be interested in (Loving the whole travel and economy stuff... and the counting continents thing  ). Assuming that Telon is the world name, if the game is based on anything, I would bet that would be a pretty good starting point for figuring out what that was.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm bettin' on original world too, heh. <br />

<br />
By defining core roles that each class needs to fit into so we don't run into the hybrid/specialist problems we've seen in other games.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
theyve 'seen in other games'? heh thats rich D&quot;&gt;  <br />

Quote:Vanguard, like our previous efforts, will lead the ever-growing market of fantasy subscription based games.<br />
<br />
And especially<br />
<br />
Quote:...we will undoubtedly make some changes and adjustments, especially during beta when many of our more ambitious ideas can be played out and tested. We will, however, endeavor especially to accurately count the number of continents.<br />
<br />
I think they're basically saying to Sony that the gloves are off. Things should be getting interesting between these two in the coming months...<br />
