<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valanze</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*note* Posted this on main EQII site but came here because I have used the site many times for EQ1. Thanks all for any help in advance.<br />
<br />
Information on the quest is as follows (not all is exact at work and going off memory):<br />
<br />
In South Qeynos in the Lions Head inn there is a man on the far left side of the bar from where you walk in.<br />
When speaking with him he mentions problems with the Bloodsabers and directs you to Ionaeus (may be incorrect) in windstalker village.<br />
Ionaeus is located in the far end of Windstalker village under a tree close to the dock.<br />
He mentions more problems with the Bloodsabers and ask you to cripple them by destroying there scryign devices.<br />
He says these are in the Crypt of Betrayl pass something* hidden by a secret passage<br />
 *Sadly I do not remember the name of what this is supposed to be passed whatever it is I think it starts with an Seer something maybe. This critical information however is not stored in your quest journal.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know where the scrying devices are? Does anyone have the person in Windstalker Village Quest text to post? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
