My partner and I were sitting around the base of the Aviak Tree in Sk when someone pulled an avo in our midst.  There was another group there as well so we dived right in fighting knowing that I could evade onto one of the tanks hitting on the avocet.  Since this avo was a free for all I started pping like mad not expecting much of anything beside money.  After getting that white message a few times that I had failed,  I was shocked and delighted to red in yellow &quot;YOU HAVE STOLEN A BLACK PEARL!&quot;  Then I backstabbed for 55 and slayed the beast.  Course I didnt' get the xp but I got the treasure so I wasn't upset in the least.  A guild mate was in the group who had helped killed the avo and laughed in disbelief when I told him what i had done.  He told his group and they laughed as well.  I eventually ended up grouping with them and WOW, they didn't care if I pickpocketed!  In fact they liked to hear the things I pped!  I sure hope I find them once again as it was a great group who totally appreciated a rogue's abilities. Joonling <br />

<br />
PS: I also think the race is important in the pickpocket chances. I'm a dark elf, and I steal many items such as words and runes. Ofcourse aviaks are too easy to steal from. ----<br />
