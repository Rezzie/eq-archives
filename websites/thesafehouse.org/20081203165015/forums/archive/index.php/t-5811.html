<br />
Your faction standing with UndeadofKith could not get any worse.<br />
<br />
And a person in my guild mentioned getting the message<br />
<br />
Your faction standing with ClawsorVeeshan could not possibly get any better.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks to me like they fixed the wrap around faction problem.<br />
<br />
rumor is also that once you get to the point where your faction can't get any worse that your faction will not go up EVER after that point.<br />
<br />
Which makes it pretty much unfeasable to try and do both dragon AND giant quests in Velious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as you get the &quot;Your faction with X cannot possibly get any worse&quot; go and kill something that raises your faction. Verant has said that all faction messages will be correct from now on, but we don't believe them, so kill a few things to raise your bottomed out faction. Now go kill a few things to lower it. Do you still get the &quot;Your faction cannot get any worse&quot; message? Either way, your question is answered.</div></div><hr />
