<br />
I use a slow wep in mainhand for Sinister Strike and consistently do huge damage. Of course I have a dagger for switching out for Ambush when needed.<br />
<br />
However, How do you choose the proper offhand? <br />
Should it be slow? Fast? Or What?<br />
<br />
Anyone that can help out with How to choose the proper speed for offhander would be great!!<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">12-06-05, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The speed of your offhand weapon is mostly irrelevant, since all special attacks use your mainhand anyway.  The only things that really matter for an offhand are the stats.  However, the one exception is that if you use dual poisons all the time, then you want a fast offhand - the faster it is, the more chances for your poisons to proc.<br />
<br />
Unlike normal procs, rogue poisons are a flat percentage chance to proc, instead of a weighted chance scaling by speed; therefore, a fast offhand will proc poisons more often than a slow offhand.  Keep in mind, tho, that non-poison procs (Crusader, Lifesteal, any innate procs, etc) will have the same number of procs-per-minute regardless of the weapon speed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
+attack power, crit, or agility are all good.<br />
<br />
I'm using a Warblade of the Hakkari in my offhand for the +40 attack power.</div></div><hr />

Yes, offhands don't do much damage, but dps from offhand starts out at half, so its better to go for speed then high damage offhand. Stats are probably the key factor though.</div></div><hr />
