Does _anyone_ have a clue how stealth is dealt with  between players?  So far people can see me forever and a day away. Also my skills are stealth 20 hide 20 at level 8. I level them up in the ship in Lomeshire which so far involves just stiing there. Also there was a GM event on server one (not the pvp server) and I have some screen shot I took while on the GM event griphon)... you want to see I'll DR themup all pretty and post them (character is a druid though)<br />
<br />
send me some mail @ Panthrao pvp server</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've found one bug that hasn't been fixed, but there are a couple illusion quests in the low level area's. (Halfling and human quests) One turns you into a frog, the other into a brownie, and if you stealth while under the illusion, you go completely invis.  The brownie one is a buff given by a NPC and only lasts 5 minutes but is repeatable....  The halfling frog quest, you are given an item to right click that will turn you into a giant frog.  You can use the item, then abandon quest and get it again and get a new item..  jsut don't finish the quest.   That is the only way around it so far that I know of.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think it's bugged.  There is a skill every player gets that measures how well one is at spotting things including invisible npc's; I believe it's called Spot oddly enough.  Anyhow, it makes no sense that this works in PvE but not PvP thus my opinion that it's bugged.</div></div><hr />

Just like the good old days of EQ1 :) Not like WoW where Rogues were easy to play in pvp.<br />
Underdog all the way !!<br />
<br />
cause it means nothing is expected from me in pvp so I dont have to live up to any expectations.. maybe this says a lot about my psycology? lol</div></div><hr />

I'm right there with you. Played a rogue, and only a rogue on sullon zek for a very long time. Very rarely won a fight, but when I did it was the best feeling in the world.</div></div><hr />

Player Detection doesnt break your effective Stealth like being detected by an NPC can. <br />
<br />
Although you stay in stealth you become the &quot;Ghostly Outline Look&quot; so they can see where you are if they are paying any attention, if you manage to stay stealthed and get beyond 25 Meters you are given another chance to re-enter stealth mode. Assuming combat hasnt already been initiated, really breaking your stealth :p.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobbwin</div><div class="date">01-29-07, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well there was a patch about mid way through Beta 5 that totally changed the stealth mechanics.  Prior to the patch, it worked much as it always did in most MMOs; you would invis, then move around only having to be leery of see invis mobs.  Your skills would go up as you walked around, regardless if mobs were present or not.  During this time, very few mobs saw through it, I was only ever seen by mobs a few levels above me.<br />
<br />
After the revamp, you only get skill ups if you're in the mob's frontal cone (it works out to be just shy of 180 degrees.  The obvious problem here is that you get seen a lot more and it takes forever to get your skill up.  However, the other change was that if you're behind the mob, it can not sense you at all, your skill and level difference to the mob is irrelevant.  They also tweaked the mechanic so that the longer you manage to stay invis while attacking, the more damage you do.  Post the revamp, I was able to kill things w/o getting hit in return or dropping invis significantly more often.  This is a hell of a lot of fun when taking out group mobs, drop one w/o the others being any the wiser, rinse/repeat.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they will modify the skill up mechanic so that you are given some credit outside of the mob's frontal cone, otherwise it will be very common to see a max level rogue w/ less than 100 skill in hide or sneak.  Otherwise, I think this was a good fix overall, it may be annoying at times, but it does make it more challenging.<br />
<br />
O yea, the other thing I hope they fix is how fast we move while invis.  I'm continually having to drop it to keep up w/ groups.  Then often end up using flash power to reinvis in order to do max damage because they had already pulled before I managed to keep up.</div></div><hr />
