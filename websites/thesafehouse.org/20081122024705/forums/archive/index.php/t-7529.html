I've been reading this forum for the past couple of days and one term or policy associated with VZ has been &quot;loot and scoot&quot;.  I understand the general meaning of it...if you are killed by a PK, loot your corpse and leave the zone for one hour but I'm not sure of the reasoning behind it.  I'm guessing it has something do to with a &quot;revenge&quot; factor?  Can someone please explain to me the meaning behind &quot;loot and scoot&quot;?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
You don't get your gear and immediately start to attack again.  You don't hang around at your corpse chatting or medding before looting.  You don't sit to Memorize spells after looting.  You don't smack talk during the process.<br />
<br />
This is a player enforced rule.  It stems from the VI rule that requires a player be allowed to loot their corpse and leave the area umolested, so long as the player does not taunt other players in the process.<br />

Basically if you don't loot and scoot you get a &quot;foul&quot; as if you were playing a sport.  Except there are no referees to enforce this most times and you have to hope the other party will play nice.</div></div><hr />

I have seen it happen. they keep kiling the players who want to mem spells to gate, or leave and the players can't because if they do in some zones they will get agroed and have no defense, leaving it up to alot of power tripping poor players is not always the best solution, sure theres some seemingly amazing players like Fricka but for every 1 of her theres 10 others who use their lack of a real life to excuse behaviour to ruin others enjoyment hehe  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wotan</div><div class="date">05-05-01, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a common misconception that there are &quot;no rules&quot; regarding this.  The fact is, though there is no rule saying that you must Loot and scoot following PvP defeat, there most certainly is a rule that says you must offer loot and scoot to your defeated foe! (See 1.2 Special rules for PvP servers, Bind-Point Corpse Camping)<br />
<br />
This is the point that some players unused to PvP do not grasp. When someone defeats you, and asks you to Loot and Scoot, he is making clear to you that he is respecting Verant's rule to allow you to loot your corpse and leave the area.  Even over and above that, he is not going to intercept you on corpse run, or try to jump you again when you are out of the immediate vicinity. If you accept you are saying that you agree to leave the zone for an hour and your opponent in peace.  <br />
<br />
If you refuse loot and scoot, you are waiving the extra consideration polite players give each other, and are merely entitled to the Verant rules: to loot your corpse and leave.  Verant rules do not state, nor even imply that you must be allowed to med, mem spells, engage in smack talk, or even loiter in the area and do nothing.  If you do not loot your corpse and leave the immediate area, within a reasonable time, you are fair game. Wotan Shaman Elder of the Shanks <br />

<br />
If there's a big fight, and one team wins, but loses a couple of members, do the dead members need to leave, too?  Or is this a &quot;team loot and scoot&quot; rule?<br />

So if one team concedes to another and leaves the zone, the victory team can continue on with all members fighting in the contested area.<br />
<br />
I, myself, LnS for one hour, no exceptions. Though I admit that I've never been part of the above listed example, as rarely anyone would give up a zone that easily or cooperatively. I'm a cynic, not enough people actually LnS, much less a group of exp suckers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Madeline TZ</div><div class="date">05-06-01, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If 2 large teams fight and the winning side has lost a few members.  It's usually ok to allow those players to be resed back as you instigate zone control.<br />
<br />
Since you control the zone, you can do what ever you want in it.  Usually it's not cut and clean as it sounds.  Simply the winning side has acess to all the corpses and the losers don't.  But most of the time it ends up being moe of a constant battle till someone gives up or thru superiority in strength demands all on the losers side leave.<br />
<br />
Usually in large encounters, brute strength and skill commands what happens in that particular field of confrontation.  Loot and Scoot was created by a general consensus of the largest party of players regarding that subject.  But if the only people using this rule are the minority, it is no longer a rule but a request.<br />
<br />
Hope that makes sense</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shaderick</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know why I'm posting on PVP threads lately, but bear with me here.<br />
<br />
Slinker: Yes, it kinda sucks not to be able to mem gate to leave when getting your corpse... but A) It does say &quot;within a reasonable amount of time&quot;  memming gate (5 seconds or so when you just got the spell, less later) and then waiting for it to cycle (Another 5 seconds or so) seems like a &quot;reasonable amount of time&quot; I certainly wouldn't begrudge you that in a PVP situation. and B) Well, if people are picky about you doing nothing but looting your corpse and leaving, then re-mem gate while at your bind point?<br />
<br />
Now there's a question. When I'm playing my enchanter (blue server of course. I wouldn't need to ask if it wasn't) when I die, the first thing I do is sit and remem spells. Is this not the case on PVP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Thurmquist</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaderick, your right.  Unless your being Bind point camped you should sit and mem your spells before coming back to your corpse, then you can loot and gate out as soon as your done.  But of course you just died so you decide you died unfairly and you don't have to scoot because there were 6 of them and only 1 of you and they were twinks, otherwise you would have owned them!  So there is no need to scoot!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wotan</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since loot and scoot is a custom, or a protocol, there is some variation on how it is observed.  Generally all agree, though, that if the person(s) that slew you vacate the zone, then you are allowed to return.  <br />
<br />
As far as memming spells goes, the thing to understand is that it is not a right guaranteed you by Verant.  If your intention is to continue to contest the zone, or to seek revenge on your opponent, then they are within their rights to impede your progress, as long as they do not slay you in the act of recovering your corpse and retreating to safety.  The bindpoint and corpse-camping rules are not intended to create magical, moveable, PvP-free zones around these spots, but to prevent exploits involving denying you your corpse.<br />
<br />
I myself play a caster, and am virtually helpless naked, with no spells memmed.  Solution? Loot your corpse and retreat to safety before memming spells.  If the corpse run is difficult, state your intention to Loot and Scoot, and in all likelihood you will get assistance recovering your corpse and getting on your way.  If not, retreat to safety, mem your spells and then proceed with corpse run.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mordier</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mainly play a rogue, but when I am messing around on my cleric alt I ALWAYS mem my spells at my bind point after death.  <br />
<br />
If your excuse for sitting to med at your corpse is that you're afraid to leave the area b/c mobs might get you, then why didn't you med those spells before you made the journey?  When I die, the first thing I do at my bind point is med.  I'm defensless without my spells so it's the only thing that makes sense.  <br />
<br />
On the flipside, when playing my rogue I usually will let someone sit quickly to mem a gate spell or something like that.  But after a quick 10-20 second count they're getting a stab in the back and another warning to leave the area.  <br />
