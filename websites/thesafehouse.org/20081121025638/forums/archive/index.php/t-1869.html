<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kinare</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever since we moved to Loveland, CO, I have really been relaxed. I love the tow we live in, I love the fact that my husband is not in the military anymore, I really like the house we live in...<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
Our landlady... Let me try to be as objective as I can.<br />
<br />
She has requested that we give her a copy of our renter's insurance. When we moved, we told hte insurance company our change of address etc... and they gave us the wrong information, so the landlady was mad that there was a delay. Now we just got the corrected version in the mail, and I am gonig to get her a copy tomorrow.<br />
<br />
She called and complained just before my husband checked the mail &quot;I don't like delays. I don't have the copy of the renters insurance form. I also noticed you haven't been pulling the weeds in the yard.&quot;<br />
<br />
The weeds? So freaking what if I don't pull the weeds. Do I look like the jolly green giant? And what State law says you are entitled to my insurance information? OF course I am too much of a wuss to say this to her over the phone. I try not to make waves, I really do...<br />
<br />
Last week I came home to find the hoses unscrewed from the faucets... Sure, it's been cold lately, but not freezing. I am guessing she came over and did that. She complains about me not watering the shrubs. I watered 2x a week until she unscrewed the hose. I assume that she doesn't want me watering because of the hose thing, but that could be the bitch in me. I thinks he does drive bys of the house. <br />
<br />
I think she comes to the house and comes inside when I am working... I am concerned. It bothers me. I don't know what to do. Edited by: Kinare at: 9/24/03 1:26 pm</div></div><hr />

Plus, remember, it's VERY hard to get rid of a renter.  So don't feel she can kick you out on your ass at the slightest inclination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">first off, does the lease require you have and maintain renters insurance? That isnt legal in California, I dont knwo about CO..<br />
<br />
Secondly does the lease require you maintain the yard?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thirdly, if you suspect she is entering the home whiel you are away, then find out 100% for sure (Video Tape would be best), and if you do use video tape, try and get her doing it on more than one occasion.. She may explain it off as &quot;I smelled smoke&quot; if it is only a single incident caught on tape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kinare</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the lease:<br />
<br />
The lawn:<br />
Quote:Lawn maintenence is provided by a private lawn maintenence company, not the tenant, and costs for the lawn maintenence is the landlord's responsibility.<br />
Also, the part where the weeds are, that's an optional garden area. Seeing as we moved in at the beginning of August, I didn't want to start a garden, because it was too late.<br />
<br />
Entry into the house:<br />
Quote:Lessor reserves the right to enter the premises  at all reasonable hours for the purpose of inspection, and wahtever necessary to make repairs and alterations to the premises.<br />
<br />
Additional terms:<br />
Quote:I need renters insurance<br />
<br />
She requires proof of renters insurance, however I do not know if that means she should be able to keep a copy of it. Edited by: Kinare at: 9/24/03 1:39 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nyssa Rainwhisper</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most counties in Colorado have laws against excessive weeds on the properties.  You might not be the jolly green giant, but trust me, the gov't don't give a damn.  They will fine your landlord which will in turn trickle down to you.  You might want to double check your lease to make sure whether or not you're responsible for it.  If so, better get weedin' otherwise, county will send someone out to do it for you and charge you 3 arms and 4 legs for it, and you don't want that when you could just easily do it yourself for free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your insurance company should be able to provide you with a statement of insurance that proves you have it without giving the details out. Call them up and ask them for it..<br />
<br />
Or provide her with a number she can verify with. Do not give her anythign with your personal information on it..<br />
<br />
Weeds: tell her she should call her landscaper then if she thinks the weeds are getting to high.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for entering the house, reasonable does not constitute daily. If it were me I would be speakign to the local renters rights board and establishing the possibility of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kinare</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I don't know what most people term excessive with regard to weeds... but I can see at least 50% dirt, and the weeds are no higher than three inches... They are ground huggers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_jolla</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tell her (in a letter) that you are very forgetful and would like all further correspondence to be in writing (so you don't forget of course).<br />
<br />
Renter's Insurance: your insurance company should be able to send her proof of coverage (without personal details - just name, address, dates, policy number, etc.).<br />
<br />
Weeds: Send her a letter explaining that per the lease, lawn maintenance is the responsibility of the landlord.<br />
<br />
Entering your house: Do you just suspect she is entering the house or do you know she is doing it?  If she is in fact entering your house, tell her in writing that you want reasonable notice (a day, 8 hours, I don't know your situation) by phone prior to non-emergency visits.<br />

She entered the property to water the grass?  Do you have some agreement that lets her enter the property at will or did she give you 24 hours notice?  That'd be enough for me to tell her to back off... politely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kinare</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This lady has an emotional attachment to this house. She did credit reports and background checks before we would be considered as candidates to rent her house, so I doubt her having our insurance information will give her anything more than she already has. <br />
<br />
It is a really nice house, and an extermely good deal (there were 6 other couples willing to do this to give you an idea). We are saving probably $200 a month living here, and the neighborhood is VERY nice.<br />
<br />
As a bargaining tool we offered to pay all of the years rent up front (we could afford it). We did.<br />
<br />
My issue is the fact that she just feels like she has to be involved. I am used to large rent conglomerates not visiting or calling =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">09-25-03, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Seattle the landlord (or his representative) has to give 48 hours notice, in writing, before entering.  Even for inspections and such.  The ONLY exceptions are things like leaks that will cause damage if left untended.  Of course, I hear Seattle has pretty pro-renter laws. Not that the landlords obey them.<br />
<br />
One place I was in, after giving my notice that I was moving at the end of the month, but before actually moving, my landlord asked when he could start showing the place.  I told him 48 hours from the time he requested to, as per the law.  The very next morning there he was knocking on my door (when I was usually at work) to show the place.  ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">09-25-03, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In CA you also get 24 hours notice before someone comes in, unless it's an emergency, and their reason has to be related to repairs, showing it off for renting, or permission.<br />
<br />
You should call some legal aid tenant's group up or look on the web for your state.  You usually can't waive that right even if the contract says you do.</div></div><hr />

It's cheap, it doesn't do any real damage to anything, and it's effective in keeping busybodies with keys out of your house when you are home and don't wish to be walked in on. <br />
<br />
It's your home, not a dorm room. Be polite, but firm on what you want and do not want this person to be doing around your home. At best your landlord with realize that they are being overbearing, and at worst you move at the end of the lease. <br />
<br />
Either that or walk around naked all the time, and &quot;suprise&quot; her like she is your signifigant other coming home. What will your landlord do? Complain that you were naked in your own home? <br />
