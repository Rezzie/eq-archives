<br />
I'm thinking of starting up a game within my circle of friends just wondering approx how many people we should have, what should the duration be...etc. gnmish.gearbinder.ring.warden.sullon.zek</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lady Kaylan</div><div class="date">05-28-03, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have our own little group that plays around here.  We fluctuate between about 10-20 people per round.  Each round usually lasts a week or two, but there's no set time limit ... just play until there's one left (&quot;there can be only one!&quot;) and then start again.  We try and get different people to play because it can become stale once you learn everyone's routine.<br />
<br />
We're using a point system right now and dunno when we're going to end the season, as it were ... or maybe we'll just play until someone reaches a certain point value.<br />
<br />
We've definately had some creative 'kills' though</div></div><hr />

This game, yeah, it's pretty popular at Texas A&amp;amp;M.  I played once, it's adapted for campus play here, we call it assassins...<br />
the only weapon is usually a water pistol, and you can't get people during lectures, 5 mins before, during or 5 mins after work.  <br />
<br />
I've won a few. &amp;lt;img src=&quot;http://phariusravenslock.homestead.com/files/sig3.jpg&quot;&gt;</div></div><hr />
