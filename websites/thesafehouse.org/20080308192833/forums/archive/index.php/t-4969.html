<br />
Some of you may have seen a previous post inwhich I explained a recent enheritance of a level 32 Infiltrator.  In years past I was a failry accomplished Rogue (EQ) and, after a night of testing things out, I realize that I miss the days of Rogue-dom and want to expand my Infiltrator.  However, being a level 33 noob (yes I leveled last night), I could use some advice.  I know I got my timing down now because last night I had to do aggro control to keep from getting pummeled.<br />
<br />
My Goal is to reach 35 with the most dealy Infiltrator I can aspire to... have a ball with Battlegrounds until I reach RealmPoint max and then move on to leveling for the &quot;end game&quot;.  Thus, I have two more levels to make and the skill points they offer to prepare.<br />
<br />
To begin with, my Spec's.  I'm told that, in some area's I'm a bit gimped.  I can't defend some of the previous desisions on specs... I just got what I got.  I'm trying to figure the best way to get to maximum assassin capabilities.  Last night I dumped all training points into Thrust save one point into Crit.  Results are thus:<br />
<br />
Level 33<br />
Stealth 32+6<br />
Slash 2+2<br />
Thrust 22+7<br />
Crit 30<br />
Dual Wield 6+4<br />
Envenom 14<br />
unallocated points 3<br />
<br />
Between now and 35 I'll have 175 points to deal with.<br />
<br />
Please advise - should I continue dumping everything into Thrust?  Shoot for 34 in Crit to get Creeping Death?  Bring up my Envenom?  Ideas?<br />
<br />
Second - I currently have all blue or green con'd armor.  I've been looking around but don't see much listed for leather armor drops on the web pages I've found.  Is there a certain place I should level in hopes of finding dropped leather armor?  Or should I just bite the bullet and buy some?  If so... what is the name of the armor I should request of my neighborhood expensive tailor? (suppose I should get red or oranged Con, but I don't know what to actually ask for.)<br />
<br />
Lastly - Last night I found a Preatorian Gladius which con's yellow and has a DPS of 11.  Thankfully for noob-me its sort of slow so I could work on my timing.  it does fairly good damage, has a +3 Thrust, and a rumored proc (didn't notice it... but had a lot to contend with last night).  Offhand I'm sporting a Long Lion Fang 10.7 DPS and +2 Thrust.  Similarly, I don't see much listed on the sites explaining better weapons until I reach level ~40 or so.  Can you tell me of better and obtainable weapons for me?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for taking the time to read this.  I would greatly appreciate any advice or links pointing me toward knowledge on the mater.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

It is a great skill.  Your piercing is high enough for now and so are your poisons.  Hit 34 with CS then start to raise your poisons and piercing again if ya want.<br />
<br />
Here is why I say this....<br />
<br />
In battlezone you will find archers or casters off to the side.  If you just perf them they will run.  However, if you perf them with a minor dot so they can't jet out and then hit them with CD.....they are dead in the water and before they come outa CD they are most likely dead.  I loved it when I was in battlezone and you will too.  You must have fast type of weapons for this.  I say anything below 2.5 speed is good.  There is a fine line between high damage weapon and a good speed weapon.  I find a weapon around 2.3 is a nice balance. Lohengrin <br />
