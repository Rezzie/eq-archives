<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_mikebridge</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but they will warp if they are moved past the halfway points in the side halls. quite annoying, make sure to control aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kalledar</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">VZ in script only splits once, compared to what 4 times on real VZ? TZ in script can be a lot more dangerous if you suck at aggro control. If not, then he's much, much easier in my opinion. Some people will say to use a SK or Paladin to tank TZ for aggro, but it's not necessary. You can use any of the 3 tank classes to tank him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kalledar</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He splits once, which creates 2 more VZ's. That's what I meant. Real VZ splits 4 or 5 times, which creates 5 more VZ's per split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Saruton</div><div class="date">11-01-03, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He splits twice. Though the time between the splits is quite short or lets say the health % at which they spawn is very close together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kalledar</div><div class="date">11-01-03, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shrug they appear at roughly the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eelyen</div><div class="date">11-03-03, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tallon Zek is pretty much exactly the same as the real TZ in Tactics.  Only main difference is that he doesn't Shadowstep around like the real one.  He is on a leash though and will warp back to Rallos Zek's room if he hits his leash.  This can have unexpected results.  Whether his HP are greater or lesser then the real TZ's.  I can't say as we have 2 different strats to deal with this guy.  But my guess is they are the same.  But I believe the RZ version is ALOT easier.<br />
<br />
Vallon Zek does infact hit harder then the real one, but not by much.  He has the same AE has the real one also.  He does have 2 copies split off from him during the fight.</div></div><hr />

They also both have an AE, granted VZ's is pretty minor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That and he has a single target aggro debuff proc and a large AE DD proc.  The AE can be avoided if you stay at max melee range.  The &quot;real&quot; TZ is considerably easier in my experience, although the fake isn't that tough once you get used to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_rainnestorme</div><div class="date">11-04-03, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I guess since TZ pops right near where we kill the trigger and it runs at you, I never considered a leash.  VZ on the other hand, if you try and pull it too far you'll know what happens.<br />
<br />
As for VZ ae, well I've stood beside VZ about a dozens times and never noticed, maybe Im resisting it. TZ on the other hand you'll know when you're too close</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the &quot;real&quot; TZ does this as well.<br />
<br />
And it's not a Large AE DD proc.  His biggest one is only 50 range.  His other 3 arrows are 2 AE's at 30 range and 1 single target.  One of the arrows has a aggro debuff, one of them has a slow.<br />
<br />
The &quot;real&quot; TZ has the exact same arrows.</div></div><hr />
