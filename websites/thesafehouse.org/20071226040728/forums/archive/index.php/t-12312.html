<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilkata Tasavalt</div><div class="date">07-26-04, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, about ten years ago a friend made me a copy of his Guyver Laserdisc on VHS.  It was a completely Japanese laserdisc, no subbing or dubbing.  At the end of the disc, there were a few previews for other anime.  I've been trying to figure out what one of them was.  Someone moved it over onto a VCD for me so I could have it on my computer(I don't own a VCR anymore), but I still can't figure out what it is.<br />
All I know is there's a guy who (at least in part of it) fights with a staff...is dressed in black..red cape...red X on his chest.  In another part his outfit seems to be blue with gold around the shoulders/sleeves.<br />
The music says &quot;Tryyyyy to believe...&quot;<br />
<br />
This is probably a longshot, but I figured I'd see if anyone here knew it.<br />

It likely is not licensed in America. However I've never heard or seen any screenshots of anything like that, so I would safely bet it's also never been fansubbed. Which likely means only a native Japanese could help you.</div></div><hr />

I second this.<br />

The description isn't ringing any bells.  I tried cross referencing based on the lyric but that didn't help either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">07-26-04, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is unlicensed, and judging by the age of the anime, it is impossible to find the raws.<br />
<br />
If it was ever fansubbed, only a handful of people know about it. But the chance of it having been fansubbed is next to none. So I think you're out of luck in finding anyone who knows this anime.<br />
<br />
Sorry couldn't give better news.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">07-27-04, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to figure out the katakana at the bottom of the screen.  The stuff at the top just says &quot;Original Anime Series  LD Version&quot;<br />
<br />
This is what I can make of the bottom text:<br />
<br />
&quot;[kanji] Rokku Roodoreoso [more kanji]&quot;<br />
<br />
I know &quot;rokku&quot; is &quot;rock&quot;, but I have no idea as to the second word.  It might be &quot;Roodoreon&quot;.  I have a hard time tellnig the difference between the katakana for &quot;so&quot; and that for &quot;n&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Are there any screens that have the name of the company that makes the series on them?  Heck, if there's a title screen for the ad itself in Japanese, I might be able to translate for you, if it's in katakana.</div></div><hr />

I dunno why, I just really like the art style on this one and I've been stuck on trying to find out what it is for a while now, as I think it looks like it would be an enjoyable one to watch.<br />
<br />
But, as far as a title screen... This is all I could get, dunno what it says.<br />

That's just who he reminded me of.</div></div><hr />

THANK YOU!!!!<br />

Until now that is. ^^;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do believe that last bit of katakana is &quot;n&quot; rather than &quot;so&quot;, making it Rokku (Locke (Along with the first kanji, Superman Locke; sorry I didn't see this thread earlier) Roodo (Road? Load? ) Reon (Leon?).  I don't know that last kanji because I'm stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lede</div><div class="date">07-28-04, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only thought Locke because I recognized the art style after seeing it once on a lazy Saturday afternoon on Space.<br />
<br />
It was a lucky guess.</div></div><hr />
