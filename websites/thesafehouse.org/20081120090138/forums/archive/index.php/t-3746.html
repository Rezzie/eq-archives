see bottom.<br />
<br />
Ok ive tried purchasing lore augs after they were mounted but couldnt right.<br />
<br />
so anyway i upgrade the dagger that had Rejuvenating Bone Fragments (the 50 hp life tap) to my bag.  And i want to put the 50hp life tap on my current offhand weapon.  But for what ever reason (hunch/instinct/eternal skeptic) i purchase the second set of Rejuvenation Bone Fragments before i destroy the first on a weapon in my bag.  <br />
<br />
BAM~ it lets me purchase em.  I mount em on my wicked shank.<br />
<br />
<br />
 i actually petitioned myself and asked if this is exploiting.  guide said he didnt know and was forwarding it.  im going to wait for a response.  <br />
EDIT:<br />
GM said he didnt expect that I would be able to loot my corpse fully.   Imagine the hastle you could cause for yourself if you didnt read the boards and didnt know the lore thing?  i mean how many people have i talked to that thought lore only meant that you could have only one per a piece.  <br />
<br />
So dont buy two lore augs~<br />
<br />
 <br />

It might be a bug with the entire system that only occasionally appears or it might just be something wrong with RBFs.  I havent tried to purchase again yet.  <br />
<br />
I destroyed the one on my massive heartwood thorne cause i didnt want to hastle with accidently looting my wicked shank first then having to destroy the aug on the wicked shank so i could loot the mht.  atleast thats what the GM warned me would happen.<br />
<br />
Anyway smart money would be not to try to verify this bug unless your planning on destroying your current RBF aug anyway to move it to another weapon.<br />
<br />
The warning the lesson is:<br />
dont try to purchase two lore augs on something expensive.  Cause it might work and the GM says your screwed if you do.<br />

<br />
For example there's two from Miragul's that have RegenerationII on them, I think.  One's MUCH cheaper and they're both LORE.  Why? So you can purchase both of them to get 4 regen, but not just buy the cheaper one twice.</div></div><hr />

If you can only have 1 lore augment that would mean you're limited to 1 vegeance augment and that would blow.  This can't be right.</div></div><hr />

You just can't equip them both simultaneously.  Because of the way LORE works with looting or something, you can't have (for example) an item with a Rejuvinating Bone Fragment equipped and loot another with the same aug.  If you put the one you already looted in a bag (or main inventory slot) you will be able to loot the other.  Probably works the same with buying them. <br />

This expansion isn't exactly meant to replace the rest of the game.  Why should someone who has never done their VT key or been to the elemental planes be able to reach the worn ATK cap?  40 ATK is 40 more than they had before.</div></div><hr />

I went ahead and got the 75dd from Miguals for 100 points. did an awsome job. so I figure might as well but it on my secoundary weapon too. until I get the Ykeasha Augs. Bought a secound 75DD Aug. and put it on my secoundary weapon. now I am procing all the time very nice I am thinking. cannot wait till I get Ykeasha.<br />
<br />
After a week or so I died. went to loot my corpse and it would not let me loot my secoundary weapon. it is it was lore and I could not loot it.<br />
<br />
After petitioning 16 hours or so till a GM finally came. He told me that I had to destroy either my primary or secoundary weapon. And he would give me a new one without the Aug on it. <br />
<br />
He also said that I would have to wait until the next patch or so when they decided how to handle the Aug stacking issue. For me to get reimbursed for my lost Aug.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quote:Using the Same Augment Twice.  You cannot seal two of the same augmentation onto the same item. The duplicate augmentation will not bond. We just wanted everyone to be clear on this point when making plans to spend their adventure points<br />
<br />
When I read this I was under the impresson that I could do what I did. but I could not put both those Augs on the same item. if said item had 2 or more proper slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Won't let me auto-equip when looting corpse, but if you put the first item into a bag you can auto-equip the second item from your corpse.<br />
<br />
Take the first weapon out of your bag, equip it, and you are set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats the bug.  funny.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt gear around it though. its begging for a nerf.  If you happen to end up with two lores fine gl!  If you gear around it though your begging for wasted points imo.<br />

<br />
1. LORE on augments will work like every other LORE item in the history of EQ.<br />
<br />
2. LORE will become completely meaningless, since you can't put two of the same augments on an item any which way.<br />
<br />
I would not plan too heavily on option two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Thinking that augmenting an item with a lore augment , then thinking that since the augment in one piece you can put another one on a different piece....  then by that Logic a person should be able to dual weild Lore Weapons because they are in different hands.   <br />
<br />
did that make sense?   I hope it did, cuz now I'm confused <br />

<br />
Actually, lots of items have two of the same slot.  For example, I just bought the 1150 neck from EF with slot 1+1+2, and put the STA+10 all aug from EC on it.  Most of the +10's are LORE, but I want to get a second STA+10 since I'm a frail wood-elf.<br />
<br />
By one set of logic I should be able to put additional STA+10 augs on other items.  However right now it seems like I should only ever be able to buy one STA+10 aug?  If it wasn't LORE, I could put two on the same item.<br />
<br />
That's lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true.<br />
<br />
Even if an aug is NOT lore, you still cannot put two of the same aug on one item.<br />

There are a wide variety of +attack augments out there, that fit in different slots and have different names.  Here's a list of all the ones you could equip if you wanted (excluding Veng 1 and 2 for the sake of this discussion)<br />
<br />
For LDoN armor:<br />
<br />
Type 3, chest only, Gravestone of Aggression, Mistmoore, 510 pts, Veng 3.<br />
Type 3, Any armor slot, Cold Slimestone of Fury, Guk, 1450 pts, Veng 4.<br />
Type 3, Any armor slot, Pristine Limestone of Hatred, Guk, 1150 pts, Veng 3.<br />
Type 3, Any armor slot, Radient Chunk of Warmth, Rujarkian, 760 pts, Veng 3.<br />
Type 3, Any armor slot, Gravestone Fragment of Battle Mastery, Mistmoore, 1150pts, Aura of Battle (Veng2, Regen2).<br />
Type 3, Any armor Slot, Translucent Orb of Courage, Rujarkian, 760 points, Aura of Courage (Veng2, Regen1).<br />
<br />
For Non-LDoN Armor:<br />
<br />
Type 7, Any armor Slot, Onyx Orb of Aggression, Mistmoore, 1450 pts, Veng 4.<br />
Type 7, Any armor Slot, Icy Diamond of Assault, Miragul, 1150 pts, Veng 3.<br />
Type 7, Any armor slot, Blackened Ore of Retribution, Rujarkian, 1450 pts, Aura of Battle (Veng 2, Regen 2).<br />
<br />
There you have it.  If you only augment your non-LDoN armor you can gain +45 attack.  Add another +45 attack if you have PoTime armor (there are type 8 augs which give Veng 3, Veng 4 and AoB).  If you include Veng 1 and 2 items you can boost it another +15 attack for your non-LDoN gear, and if you upgrade to several LDoN armors you can actually reach the 250 attack cap with only augments.<br />

What appeared to be heaven-sent for Players who can exp without issue, have enough skill to take on and win any event they choose (see Drinal Flag Rebellion for details) and STILL just want to play with their friends and maintain non-raiding casual fun play....is a total and complete sham.<br />
<br />
The approach just throws the baby out with the bath water.<br />
<br />
There are people out there that have ever bit as much skill as a regular raider in a higher tier guild that just want a way to keep improving their characters without becoming one of 50 people throwing DPS at a mob  <br />

Just a quick note.<br />
<br />
Lore augmentations are supposed to work just like any other lore item.<br />
<br />
There is a bug right now that let's you purchase more than one if the other lore items are buried in bags. We'll be fixing that with the next update.<br />
<br />
We'll be deleting any extras with the next update, and refunding any points spent on them.<br />

<br />
The LDoN aguments have changed a lot since I first looked at this issue.  I wrote up a comparison between LDoN armor and Ornate and VT armor. LDoN armor is definitely nice in some areas, has lots of AC and HP, but even fully augmented lacks in effects, sta, dex and atk compared to VT armor.  This is a far, far cry from what some people were claiming when LDoN was newish and they were claiming that it was as good as elemental and &quot;too good for casual players&quot;.  It quite simply is not.<br />
<br />
2 months into it, I've gotten 3 items out of LDoN but my playing time is slowing down, so I figure I'll probably be getting 1 item a month.   /shrug  That's 1 item per month more than I ever got out of PoP really, so that's an improvement.<br />
<br />
I still think that SOE has the bar of time you have to commit per upgrade too high.  But they set that bar high like that way back in Luclin with their incredible time sinks for raiders so I doubt we'll see them lowering it, otherwise the people who routinely jump those hurdles will be upset.<br />
<br />
High level EQ for casual players still isn't a great game.  It's gotten better with LDoN in that there is a growth path now at least, but it still feels like they really don't have any understanding of what casual players want out of a game.</div></div><hr />
