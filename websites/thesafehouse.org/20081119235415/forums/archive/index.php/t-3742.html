I would try the VT level raids.  Either should be doable.  You would even have a shot at the elemental one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sebbi Fyrewalker</div><div class="date">12-02-03, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't recommend LDoN raids to a pre-VT guild.  Right now my guild is a Rallos Zek kill short of the Elemental Planes.  We've done AHR cycle a few times as well as extensive farming of Ssra, Seru, and non-cycle VT named.<br />
<br />
Our LDoN experiences have been less than inspiring.  We've only tried the VT level NRo raid twice.  The first time, we spent most of the time clearing, but couldn't figure out what needed to be done, to move on to the second phase of the raid.  We were expecting some sort of challenge named to finish the raid, that we just hadn't figured out how to spawn.<br />
<br />
The second time going back, we figured out how to trigger the next part of the raid.  Another 2+ hours of boring clearing, and the event trigger after just destroyed us.  We've discussed numerous strategies how to beat it, but couldn't come up with anything practical.  Add to that the need to commit to 2 hours of boring clearing, just to test out a strategy.... The LDoN raids just don't make sense.<br />
<br />
I look forward to trying them out once we have better gear / AAs, but the raid we tried out has been very disappointing thus far.<br />
<br />
Long story short, try a raid out if you're curious, but don't expect them as a source of loot, until the gear makes them viable.</div></div><hr />

The above is 100% accurate.  <br />
<br />
We've finished Valdoon and Ruj Prisoners raid... and should be done with Tak and Mir in the next try... but the process up until this point has been painstaking.  Multiple iterations of 2-hours-of-clearing-just-to-try-and-figure-out-how-the-raid-works is silly... and there are not nearly enough &quot;hints&quot; from the scripts as to what you're supposed to do... and even when you fail for a retarded reason, there's a 5 day reset.  <br />
<br />
All our learning has been by trial and error and subsequent analysis of logs to try and figure out wtf happened and why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_stehle</div><div class="date">12-08-03, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can feel your pain on the Tak raid (VT level).  We have done our fourth attempt at the raid and have finally figured out how the run the entire encounter-- only to figure out that if we don't have a &quot;perfect&quot; raid setup (i.e. each group essentially needs to be well-balanced with tank / slower / healer / dps else you will run into problems).<br />
<br />
Since we don't require Tak raids (i.e. not stamped), getting an exact makeup is very hard to do.  Also, the clearing is boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First time, we got to the first of the Warlord's Captains.  We wound up beating the Captain but the death count ended the raid.  We had one friend who'd done this raid before and he was able to tell us about the captain's bodyguards in advance.<br />
<br />
Second time, we lacked the DPS we needed to kill all of the bodyguards before the captain charged.  Still, we managed to get one captain (of three).<br />
<br />
It was tough, but with another group worth of DPS (we had 30 people) we'dve won.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_rani</div><div class="date">12-11-03, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Kroggi - Elemental (elemental quality reward.)&quot;<br />
<br />
Is the easiest of the raids we have tried so far(easier than some of the ones marked VT level). It also gives better rewards than the VT level raid we beat(kill some warlord).<br />
<br />
Generally I think these these raids needs some tuning in the downwards direction(except the Krogg one, that one is pretty easy). <br />
<br />
And some of the insta-fail conditions needs looking into. Example Qileour Bakuel - Find Lost Comrades(Miragul :<br />
<br />
1 1/2-2 hours into the adventure there is a corpse of a dead adventurer you need to protect.. like 10 un-tauntable mobs pop and rip it to shreads in 1 minute, and then you fail and get ported out of dungeon.<br />
<br />
Very frustrating to spend 2 raids beating all the other sub-encounters getting that far, only to fail and be ported out after a 1 minute encounter, which seemingly is very difficult since they are impossible/hard to taunt and &quot;seemed&quot; to have too much HP for us to be able to AE them down, but we will try that next time, IF we ever go back.<br />
<br />
And get this, the above raid is &quot;normal&quot; difficulty!? (we have killed Quarm 15 times for reference btw). So in all likelyhood the rewards will be of questionable use for us.<br />
<br />
In general for the rewards they give they take too much time(1-3 raids just to get a general idea of whats required, much less perfecting your technique) and it would be nice with a more few in-game hints/clues on what the objectives are and how you might reach them as noted by a poster above.

Yeah thats the one. One of them spawns adds and have more HP than the others, you need an enchanter for this one(forgot which one it is sorry). The 2 others die fast and you can have the groups killing those run over and help finish the last one once they are done.<br />
<br />
There are also 3 elite scion guards you can kill before reaching the final bosses. I dont know if you _have_ to kill them, but I seem to recall that it gave some msg about the dungeons treasure, so it might result in more loot if you do. At least we usually kill them.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gurgeh</div><div class="date">12-13-03, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tak VT lvl raid is kill the bejeweled guard, if I remember correctly. There are 2 parts in this raid, 1st you need to clean to the 3 'earth elemental' and trigger them. When you trigger the 3rd, in the room near each trigger, 4 waves of 5ish mobs will pop, and then a 'named', you need to kill the 3 named in order to win the raid, this within 3 hours, and with less than 72 death(I think, it's much more than 36, but wiping twice will cause a fail).<br />
<br />
The 1st part is not that easy in fact, you have some regular mobs that hit for 900ish or so, easy to pull 3-4 max. And you have trap that will pop ~10 scarabs, they don't hit as hard as regular trash, but still can hurt. You can AE them or CC them. It's easy to CC with 3-4 enc / bards. There are 5 or so traps and a few dozen regular trashs on the way to the 3 triggers.<br />
<br />
Before triggering the 3rd earth elemental, you might want to split your raid in 3, for each trigger. Once the 3rd is triggered the 4 waves of 5 mobs will start to pop in the 3 different room, you might want to not sit right in the pop room, but a bit further away, so you can split them, in 2 pulls of 2-3 mobs. <br />
After 4 waves a named pop in each room, they are really easy, about the same as hard adv named.</div></div><hr />

Or are they all a min 18 max 36 kind of thing?  Does anything scale depending on your numbers, or is it a flat rate like a regular adventure?

For those of you who are getting progression, can you tell me how exactly you're clearing the trash?  <br />
<br />
We're missing somethign very simple I fear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sakharra</div><div class="date">02-06-04, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We hit the same problem with bugs we could'nt find, exactly 11 of them.  We eventually got some stuff to spawn in 3 rooms but since everyone was spread out on a massive hunt for invis bugs (we were low on time), those spawns turned in to a rather uncoordinated wipe.  <br />
<br />
At that point we were pretty convinced the raid had bugged (pun sort of intended) and in our frustration had split up and were just trying to do anything to progress.  <br />
<br />
One thing, perhaps a consideration, perhaps not, we've never been back to confirm this.  We had left a few of the trees up (the ones that give mana or spawn baby trees).  The rooms spawned after the last of those trees and the resulting baby trees were killed...  This could be coincidence, but thats the way it happened.  It may be that you have to kill absolutely everything.<br />
<br />
Note to any devs who may read this forum...<br />
<br />
We tend to be pretty motivated on new (to us at least) content, especially when there is a lack of spoiler information but LDoN has proven to be a different story.  Its hard to motivate people to try a raid when there is next to no information even on what your supposed to do and no way to tell if the raid is even working as intended in the first place.  <br />
<br />
Mystery bugs that a ranger can track but no one can see or kill..  No there MOBs up...  What would you think ?  <br />

We started the ring. Killed the 2 first bosses, but the 3rd once was unkillable. Regenning to full hp every tick by warping back (leashed) even tho we were stading on his warp spot killing him. Anyone else who experienced this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Everan</div><div class="date">02-06-04, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have done the VT level Tak raid 2 X's now, both failed.  But learning lots =).  First you have to get the 3 elementals to the 3 rooms, and you have to kill all the trash to those rooms to get them there.  Including the trees.  Once you get all 3 elemntals to their rooms,..... nothing happens!  Well we think we finally figured out how to get the rooms to spawn.  You have to split your raid into 3 parts.  And it seems that once you get X amount of people in each room, it triggers the 5 mobs of 4 waves.  So basicly once you are close to getting the last elemental to his room, split your raid into 3 sperate subgroups.  so 3 sets of 2 groups each.  They have to be well balanced groups ei.... Tank, cleric, Slower, CC.<br />
<br />
   Now once everyone is set, have the 2 groups that are at the elementals enter the room.  Once everyone says there ready, clear the way for the last elemental to enter, follow behind, and once he gets there, the 5 mobs/4waves should spawn... they hit around 1k, not sure if they quad.  Some are mezzable.  Also they are on a leash.  If you run back into tunnle, and they follow, they will warp back to their spawn points.  So you actually can't pull them very far from the main room.  note they have a HUGE agro range.  Anougher important note,  Spawns are on a timer, NOT on a kill ratio.  At one point when we were trying to figure out how to split them, we had ALL of them spawned.  So we had 20 mobs that were in the room.<br />
<br />
   Well thats about all i know, we are going to keep trying, and one day I am sure we will win =).  This is a great thread, and if anyone else have info they are willing to share on other LDON raid events, pls do.  Once we have this one down pat, we will be hitting a new one, and once I get info on those, I will be back to share =).<br />

<br />
You do not have to kill everything in the zone, what you have to do is clear the way for the 3 elementals to get to their rooms, nothing happens UNTIL you say<br />
<br />
&quot;We are ready&quot; <br />
<br />
Only one person or perhaps the raid leader has to say it, I was raid leader and I said it and all 3 rooms started spawning(this is where we died, ,we were down to 24 people by this time and couldnt handle the 5 at a time with 8 people in each room)<br />
<br />
Some are mezzable and some arent, they are all named the same so you cant tell if they are mezzable or not. I was also told that the uunmezzables are also un rootable/mezzable tho I suspect its really the other way around much like POJ trial mobs.<br />
<br />
The clues on how to continue are said by the elementals when they reach their destination.. they say something like I will show you the treasure but not till your forces are in place in the other rooms as well. Taking a not so huge jump to conclude that they need you to say &quot;We are ready&quot; like so many other POP event triggers(they are untargetable, but I was just near him when i said it)<br />
<br />
You dont have to kill everything, you only have to get the elementals to their respective rooms and then say &quot;we are ready&quot; and start the ring event. then the bosses spawn at the end and I guess thats when you collect your loot. Will post more when i have more info.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit --<br />
<br />
The group I did this with,  we started out with 27 and easily cleared all that was needed with more then 30 minutes to spare before we tried to trigger the ring event, My guild is a VT level guild we have done mobs like Agnarr, Mith Marr ect, ,but have not unlocked elementals or Sol Ro quite yet. Was a late night raid and most of the people there were not the best geared so its not really that hard of a raid to do, I would guess anyone that can do Cursed or HP in ssra can do this event with good class balance.<br />
<br />
Edit #2 - this is in reply to the person that responded to me.<br />
Its very possible that you dont have to say anything, we killed the last mob and it seemed like nothing was happening so I took a chance and said &quot;we are ready&quot; and suddenly the mobs spawned.. It may have been just I said it when it normaly would spawn. <br />
<br />
I had read that others couldnt continue due to bugs being under the world and they hadnt killed everything in zone, I left a large number of rooms full of mobs in my raid so killing everything has nothing to do with the cycle starting. It could be that the words will start the cycle and it could be the cycle automaticaly start after so long. This was our first trip so I cant tell you for sure.
