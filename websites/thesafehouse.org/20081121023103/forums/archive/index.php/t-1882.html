I just recently tried their CD and I have to say, the band sucks. The band sucks but the singer, the chick, is awesome. The backup singer(s) which sounds like the guy from linkin park is terrible. What needs to happen is the lead singer needs to get with some real musicians and make some good music. Get rid of these multiple lead voice tracks which have become a staple of bad pop music. It pisses me off when talent is wasted on pop music manufactured by the record companies. Come to think of it, the guy from linkin park who does all the wanna be rapping needs to be kicked out of linkin park too because he ruins all of their songs also. I know there's more of this crap I could rant on but I can't think of the other bands right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think one problem with her dumping the band and getting a better one would be that I think the &quot;Linkin Park wannabe&quot; is the guy who writes the songs.  I've at least seen him in two different interviews talking about how he goes about writing songs.  I've never seen any interviews with the woman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've heard 5 or so of their songs, probably all off the latest album. Decent stuff. Mr. Linkn Park (that's so appropriate, I feel the same way about LP's music as well) definitely needs to go. <br />

What a bunch of melodramatic cry babies who think they can make music, my god! If you wanna be all dramatic and serious-like, at least be good musicians. I mean what the @#%$ is their problem! I hate bands like Evanwhatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_rose</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sure, her singing is great, but so is aimee mann's or that chick from poe, the only reason they get more coverage is because of one magic word, &quot;gimmick.&quot; face it, dark moody music sells these days, especially if the cover of the cd features a hot pale chick with eyeliner. <br />
<br />
its amazing these days how people can visually borrow from a culture to market music. not saying that the goth genre can lay claim to black hair dye and liquid liner or anything, but the introverted emotional music that can claw its way out of the ever growing &quot;emo&quot; chasm can now freely utilize the monochromatic look. it really tends to expand the marketing demographic to people who want so desperately to be different, to put it in cliche terms. <br />
<br />
so in short, with evanesance, i don't see what all the brouhaha is about.  they're good, and though i'm not about to point the finger at them and go &quot;posers,&quot; they're nothing special, or even different. just the same garage band with a hot chick singer and emotional lyrics in a shiny new wrapper.</div></div><hr />

Infinitely better than the CD version.  There's also a fun studio version of Swing, Swing there too.  ;p  Hoobastank is gonna be in the studio tomorrow so I'm hoping to hear some acoustic from them.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, their CD has too much aural clutter.  Amy is an amazing singer, tho.  Their older songs that I've...found...have been MUCH better than the new CD. Amadan  ::  Child of the Phoenix  ::<br />

If Evan is still on the charts ten years from now, they could be called great. Until then, theyre just the current flavor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nyssa Rainwhisper</div><div class="date">10-07-03, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh please, how many new bands YOU like will still be on the charts 10 years from now?  Think of all the &quot;best new artist&quot; winners in the past 10 years.  How many are actually still around making decent stuff, much less on the charts?  Modern music is fickle.  Not very many bands make it mainstream and stay there for long.</div></div><hr />

It is similar to this in music like Linkin Park(I dont know how to classify them, it is like wanna-be rap mixed with wanna-be metal.)  Except with the Linkin park type music a few people of the herd will break off and actually like them for more then 3 months.<br />

You just only hear the garbage &quot;Rawr I want to eat a corpse&quot; American garbage and the bands who try to throw in some metal stuff to make them seem heavy.<br />

Some metal is melodic and graceful, much easier to enjoy then most types of music.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I said was the true test of great pop music is lasting (Aerosmith, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Elton John, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Madonna, etc). You know theyve got something if they can do it, then do it again, and then again. Know what Im saying?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">10-08-03, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Y'know, some silly arguments just got made.<br />
<br />
What does how beautiful the singer, or 'culture-borrowing' (culture impurification? Heil~!. Heh sorry.) have to do with how well she sings?<br />
<br />
Of frigging course there's other people in the world who can sing well. She's got a beautiful voice. If you can't hear that because all of the songs off the new cd are moody love songs, then you're not as great of a music lover as you think you are. Poe is an excellent vocalist, but she sings differently. Just like Sarah McLachlan sings differently than Tori Amos. Just like the dudes from POD sing differently than... I really don't want to think about those kind of bands, sorry.<br />
<br />
What is important, though, is that there aren't many big main stream female vocalists who aren't in the R&amp;amp;B/hiphop genre. The more women with well-strung chords belting it out, the better.<br />
<br />
But yeah, musical tastes are fun.<br />

<br />
the actual band is just amy and the other guy, and once you take out all the unneeded vocal tracks and stuff, they are really quite good.<br />
<br />
that said, they need a LOT more songwriting variety =/</div></div><hr />
