<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">01-18-05, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some friends and I have tried to do it and failed.  A friend at work (different server and faction) has tried and failed repeatedly.  <br />
<br />
The main thing we've tried to focus on is staying back from the steps, focusing on the elites.  It seems though no matter what we try we, we fail... either the mobs over run us at the top, or a couple of the NPCs we are rescuing run off towards the bottom of the temple agro everything and die in short order, failing the event.  Yay us.<br />
<br />
One friend in my group insists that mages AEing are the key, while my friend at work IS a mage and says any time he tries to AE he instantly gets mobbed and slaughtered afetr the first one.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any tips?  I'd kinda like to get that ring.  I may not be able to convince people to go back now but that's another challenge.  It's obviously doable because a lot of people are wearing the quest reward and I'm beating my head bloody trying to figure out something different to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bros</div><div class="date">01-19-05, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completed this event with 48 priest,49 hunter, 51 rogue, 52 paladin, 48 warrior.<br />
<br />
First thing is go /pvp  if your on a blue server. It is believed the AE heal from the ncp will hit your group members.<br />
<br />
We then assisted the paladin in killing one mob at a time until they all died. When an Elite showed up we all jumped on it. If the priest pulled aggro he would fade. If the priest held aggro the hunter would distracting shot and taunt with pet. Consentrated DPS is the key. Get them dead one at a time. <br />
<br />
When we completed the waves we walked downt he steps and fought the NPC we had defended.  Kill the dwarf first as it is the healer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biral</div><div class="date">01-21-05, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The times i did it, we had a mage and a warlock ae'ing everything and me and anther melee concentrating on the elites while priest did his thing. From the account above i'm guessing this isn't neccesary, but its one way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malse</div><div class="date">01-25-05, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did this without a mage or warlock (heh, no priest either. Was ... interesting) back in December, basically you just need to gradually work your way down the steps and make sure the NPCs always have aggro on stuff otherwise they blithely run down ahead of you and get killed. <br />
<br />
<br />
AFAIK only Bly has to survive, but you get nice loot off any of the others that do when they turn on you later.</div></div><hr />

If it gives you that option then I doubt its an exploit.<br />
<br />
They probably put it in to give rogues and druids a feeling of unique usefulness in a fixed situtation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">02-13-05, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone on another forum suggested that option only becomes available to horde.  *shrug* I dunno.  Even for them it seems to be random if they get the option.  Since it seems to be random and it doesn't work for everyone I personally can't help but feel it's a &quot;cheat&quot; and not how the encounter is supposed to work.  I certainly don't hold it against anyone for going that route, but we were never given the option anyway.<br />
<br />
So while I'm on the topic, Stabba (if you even read this, I know that post was a while back) are you guys horde or alliance?  Seemed fishy to me that the option would only come up for horde if I could get a confirmed use of it by alliance then it would be interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">02-16-05, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just a note.<br />
<br />
if you choose to kill bly, you can/should talk to the goblin first and he will free himself, and run to the gates to open them up for killing the 2 high trolls.  then you can talk to bly and get him aggro and kill him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">02-16-05, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest that entire event is so horribly bugged we practically cried with relief when we finally completed it. Which we did for the Nekrum's since the first time it was bugged and Bly and co. attacked us straight away without any trolls spawning - so that's not just Horde, it's a bug. A somewhat good bug since the event is so buggy even when it does start right. Sometimes you get waves, sometimes you get rushed by every single bloody troll, sometimes nothing spawns, sometimes it's less of waves and more of a steady stream with not as much as a single drink break.<br />
<br />
One thing I can say is AEs are murder in there, in our experience the first person to start AEing was the first person to die. The earlier stuff about an AE heal cast by npcs I can only say I spent a long time reading over my combat log the one time we did try that approach and saw no heal ever hit me from the dwarf, so don't count on it and bring potions aplenty. Don't go too far down either, Bly on all occasions we lost outlasted our group. We'd be dead and watch him fight the trolls for quite a bit before they overwhelmed him. He tanks far better than your average gnomish mage or nelf druid hehe. Thank god I don't have to go back to ZF, I hate that event and the bugged spawns who lock you in combat with a passion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underdawg Darogue</div><div class="date">02-16-05, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hsa anyone gotten the bug since patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">02-22-05, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We just did this quest last night but we needed the amulet from Nekrish so we had to do the fight.  The bug we encountered is that we got a patrol with a basklisk joining in the fight.  And the friggin Basklisk was immune to attacks for about 3 minutes.  We couldent get it off bly and it killed him.  THEN we could attack it. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Theivan</div><div class="date">03-24-05, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we did it last night on Natherzim (post patch) and encountered no bugs whatsoever.<br />
<br />
group was 43 druid, 48 paladin, 46 rogue, 51 rogue, 48 warrior.  all the prisoners lived till the end. it may have been fixed with this patch ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">03-28-05, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The waves have been toned down considerably in the patch.  The event is almost *gasp* fun now, instead of frustratingly obnoxious.  The named Witch Doctor's loot table is still crap though.</div></div><hr />
