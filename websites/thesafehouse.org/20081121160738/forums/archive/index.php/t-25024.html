I'll be back on the third.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">07-01-06, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well I wasn't sure if it was against safehouse rules posting exploits and such.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets just say we found a way to keep the fifth part of the vault open, allowing entry to the sixth part (which we were able to restart), and we also figured out a way to kill the dragon without completing the quest (and to get loot too).<br />
<br />
It was one of those things the devs could never have planned for, quite crazy actually.</div></div><hr />

My question is why? You guys knew it was a cheat but did it anyway.<br />

But I guess curiosity gets the better of us :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ever ever ever.<br />
<br />
There is no way to face her legitimately, you have to sacrafice someone to bug her out, only then can you kill her.<br />
<br />
If you bug her out, it takes four people tops, if you don't, you can loose a whole raid.</div></div><hr />
