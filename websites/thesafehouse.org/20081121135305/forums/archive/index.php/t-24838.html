<br />
I'm pretty sure resists and AoE type crap (fire balls etc) are on the menu :P.<br />
<br />
Knowing our luck its a boss caster...haven't seen many of those really and they have to be hard.<br />
<br />
Prob should stock up on some cure pots etc just incase healing goes dry.</div></div><hr />

I got a +2 Icy Burst Short Bow :b Its a short bow... but hey I get to use my dex bonus instead of my str. In other news I'm wagering that we're going to go up against some form of demon...maybe a balor...that would be too easy for us though.<br />

What's the minimum level on rez scrolls?  I'm going to have to start carrying a few for the beholders.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">06-18-06, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleh, you're probably right.  Motego isn't too far away, but it's too much to hope that that would be a ranger spell too.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it looks like we're in for giants at the end of South (screenshot from Elite):</div></div><hr />

Should not be too bad...from the looks of it he is atlest alone in the room. But he is pretty much dead :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT:  That was quick.  nothing good for me.  Only weapon I saw was a +2 anarchic dorf axe of deception for trade bait for 42k.  Virtually no armor.  Will need to check later tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">06-18-06, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and the giant had stoneskin, thats atleast a 5/DR atleast I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But they're 6500gp each and I have to roll a 13 to use them, so don't think this gives you an excuse to die. :b</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you go to raise dead we shouldn't be harassed so what you could do is like equip command, raise your char with a wand, and such. Get it as high as possible before attempting to raise someone. Sing a song or two?</div></div><hr />

So 11, then, and if I pick up the +3 UMD necklace from Delera's these things are looking downright reasonable.<br />
<br />
Y'all still aren't allowed to die though.</div></div><hr />
