<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">06-05-00, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was in Blackburrow when an extremely high level enchanter does a /shout asking someone to point the way to Halas. Well I figure heck, plenty of people can show him that, so I didn't say anything. Five minutes later he's still /shout'ing so I volunteer to direct him to Halas. So this werewolf shows up, and I lead him to the Halas exit. He thanks me. I wasn't expecting anything, but he casts a buff on me!<br />

Mmm, uhh thanks heh. Anyway he claritied my wizzie friend so we were happy anyway :p<br />

Ok the other story. I go into Befallen to practice pick lock. I hide by the door and start picking away. Shortly after, I notice every other opening or so if off sync. Come to find out there was another hidden Rogue there working out too :p That's pretty cool, because on Rallos I've NEVER seen more then 10 people in Befallen.<br />

Despite the fact that they are insanely powerful and useful, again stressing that we will have to be very careful implementing poison to insure that we don't severly overpower them, there are still a LOT of people out there who think that rogues are useless.- Abashi</div></div><hr />

We ended up being heroes of the place as someone got trained on the second level and didn't have a key.  He screamed for someone to open the door but no one near the door could.  Its all good as we were standing right there picking the lock. Cheers rang through the dungeon for our abilities.  It was a good day. Joonling <br />
