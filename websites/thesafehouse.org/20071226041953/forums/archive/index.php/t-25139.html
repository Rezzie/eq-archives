Wow, some violence.<br />
<br />
Yes, this show has violence. And a whole lot of it. Plenty of blood, plenty of gratuitous breaking of arms, legs, knees, thighs, heads, and any other body part, along with the overabundance of peeling. This is not for the faint of heart. Vice City has nothing on this. Neither does Elfen Lied. The violence comes in swift and kicks you right in the groin. By the same director of Guu, this show does not pull any punches. Sure, it's a magical girl show. Sure, the plot is completely incoherent. Sure, there are way too many puns regarding Japanese culture. However, if you need something to shock your friends into watching anime (or not watching anime), then this is the show for you.<br />

 There is something satisfying with her breaking bones over and over.</div></div><hr />

But cute girls wrecking havoc is an appealing niche, so i'm going to watch and pray.</div></div><hr />

There is something that I didn't like about Dokuro-chan, dropped it by ep 3, this one has opposite effect.</div></div><hr />
