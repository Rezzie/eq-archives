<br />
Order Of The Black Rose is a rouge only guild that was founded in the very early days of EQ1. Sence then, we have been on most MMORPG's, including EQ2, SB, NWN, CoH, SWG and a few others. We are now making our new home on Vanguard. Many of our current members have been around sence the old days of EQ1. Including our guild founder. <br />
<br />
As stated above we are a rouge only guild. We are on the Tharridon server, Some of us pvp and some of us do not. We do not tell our members how to play the game. If all you want to do is pk till your hearts content, then by all means do so. We are not a pvp guild, at the same time we are not a anti pvp guild. We take a netural stance on pvp. Its your choice. If all you want to do is craft, go for it. The same gos for adventuring. Simply put, we do not tell our members how to play. We do not force our members to play a set number of hours a week. How you play, when you play is up to you. <br />
<br />
We are more of a rogue school than anything. We help each other, help the new players who wish to lead the rogue lifestyle. More that that we are a family. Many of us have been together several years. In fact you may have see us in various games and even at one time been in one of our many chapters. <br />
