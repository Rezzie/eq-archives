<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Krelios</div><div class="date">05-14-02, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, I got 705.<br />
<br />
With bonuses I have 50 CS, 50 thrust<br />
Using Shimmering arcanium guarded rapier:<br />
16.4/3.5.  Effective dps: 15.8 I believe.<br />
<br />
Even buffed, the 705 seems to be the limit.  I'm not talking the ( ) numbers, I'm talking the final damage output not in parenthesis.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing try to get a higher quality rapier for a higher effective dps.<br />
<br />
Was wondering if having 50+ thrust and 50+ CS helps push perfs higher.<br />
<br />
With respec I plan to shave off unnecesary points from envenom (it can reach 54 now) and throw more into my raw thrust skill.   I love using lifebane, so I prolly won't push my thrust to a raw 50 for the uber stun, however.<br />

<br />
Raising thrust beyond 50+ did not raise the perf artery cap, as expected (tested using more +thrust items, but same weapons).<br />
<br />
So now just have to check on the highest quality best player made perf weapon.<br />

<br />
use a slower weapon.<br />
<br />
yes, weaponskill past 2/3 raises PA cap.  it rolls out to 1.5 per point of weaponskill that is added to your cap. Dither Disgustipated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">05-16-02, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dither, not sure where that number comes from.  <br />
<br />
As I stated in another thread you gave that number on, raising my thrust spec from 43 to 50 makes no difference at all on my pa cap.  The only people I have ever heard that weapon spec increases perf caps are shadowblades.<br />
<br />
I have always kept my weapon spec high, and have never gained anything on my pa cap from increasing it.  Perhaps it is something with the difference between sword spec and thrust, or possibly only makes a difference at lower weapon spec.  I've always been at at least 3/4 spec so wouldn't know how lower spec would effect it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maoudeib</div><div class="date">05-17-02, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I gather, raising the primary weapon skills does not raise the cap.  However, it does raise the minimum damage, thus increasing the average perf artery.<br />
<br />
So, I suspect 50+ primary weapon skill continues to raise the minimum damage on CS attacks.  However, that is difficult to prove.  As a side benefit your primary weapon style attacks would directly benefit, increasing their cap AND minimum damage.<br />
<br />
However, does the damage per hit use the stated dps of a weapon, or the effective dps?  If your CS skill sets a max perf regardless of the weapon...then a variety of weapons would likely hit that cap, regardless of the specific quality.  But I don't think that is the case.. based on the perfs reported in the high 700's from infiltrators.<br />
<br />
My current weapon: shimmering arcanium guarded rapier.<br />
<br />
16.4/3.5:  16.4 damage/sec  3.5 secs/1 hit = 57.4 damage (units?) per hit.<br />
<br />
Compare to arcanium gladius.<br />
<br />
16.1/3.7  = 59.57 damage (units?) per hit, better than my weapon.<br />
<br />
I'd have to test this out myself, I only noticed this after someone mentioned the gladius would be the superior perf weapon.<br />
<br />
Upon further checking, I noticed an even better weapon, but it's a slasher:<br />
<br />
Arcanium bastard sword:<br />
16.2/3.9 = 63.18 damage (units?) per hit, better result than any other weapon I've seen...high dps and very high spd for a 1h weapon.<br />
<br />
I'll try to get a shimmering arcanium gladius and give you the results.<br />
<br />
If possible, I'll try and even test the bastard sword.  On grey level 1 mobs I should be able to hit the max damage on a perf with that weapon.<br />

<br />
i had the highest PA on palo and it was only by a few points.  all of the critblades had the same cs and cs with items, so we al stripped down to wearing only the same items that raised cs by the same ammount, and when sword bracers were put on, cap raised.<br />
<br />
we then put on a bunch of sword gear, and cap was raising 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, basically 1.5 per point of sword, Dither Disgustipated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">05-17-02, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dither, when you posted that on palomides Khaja, Ravn, Nazir and several other infiltrators all backed me up that weaponskill does not effect perf cap for us.<br />
<br />
I saw the screenshots Stungard put up of increasing axe raising his cap.  If that is what raised his cap great, but that does not work with thrust.  Over the last 3 levels I have raised my thrust from a base of 38 to a base of 45.  Over that time I have not increased my CS skill at all.  My perf cap increased 9 points.  That was because I went from rank 3 to rank 4 effectively raising my cs skill by 1.<br />
<br />
As I said in my previous post, I don't know why this would work differently, but it does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
post logs and test more thoroughly.  maybe you are already at a cap that those of us with a normal amount of spec points can't get to, or maybe its simply one small facet of the game you aren't allowed to have an advantage at. Dither Disgustipated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Krelios</div><div class="date">05-18-02, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tested my max perf of Powder Maker, it's an often overlooked thruster that drops off named mobs in Dartmoor.<br />
<br />
15.9 dps/3.7 spd.<br />
<br />
At 50 CS/52 Thrust (due to +2 thrust of weapon):<br />
Max perf: 411, with CF +2 df gloves max was: 429.<br />
<br />
Now I know it wasn't the +2 thrust that boosted the max perf...because I tested that already.<br />
<br />
But the dps*spd for this weapon exceeds my shimmering guarded rapier.<br />
<br />
So the shimmering gladius should give me a slightly higher max perf (16.1dps*3.7dps &gt;15.8dps*3.7).  I wonder by how much.<br />
<br />
I still want to test a shimmering arcanium bastard sword (16.2 dps, 3.9 dps)...I believe that would give the biggest max perf available to infiltrators.<br />
<br />
Btw, the powder maker results suggest max perf is NOT influenced by the quality of a weapon or the effective dps, but rather by the stated dps or the clamped dps.  Otherwise, powder maker at 89% quality should not have given me a better max perf than my shimmering arcanium guarded rapier.<br />

<br />
With a 15.8 / 3.2 playermade rapier, I currently hit for 720 with 50 base CS.<br />
<br />
If i swap in my cs gem, I can hit for 747.<br />
<br />
I guess if i used CS gloves, and that slythcur cloak I could get it up to around 760something...<br />
<br />
Really floor damage (i.e. weapskill ==&gt; thrust) seems more important to me than max damage, cause most people have over 800 hp.</div></div><hr />
