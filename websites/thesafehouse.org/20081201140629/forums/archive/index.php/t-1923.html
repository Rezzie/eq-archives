<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">10-18-03, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went to a cinema pre-release thing for an upcoming VNV Nation dvd last night. While standing in line, goths to the left, rivetheads to the right, I notice just ahead, a suspicious grey baseball cap. I nudged Kelthana, pointing giddily. We walked up and introduced ourselves, (I didn't catch his name though with all the backround noise), and went back to our place in line. Two minutes later, his friend takes off his jacket to reveal an Allakazam's t-shirt underneath. Freakin' cool, I think. We are everywhere.<br />
<br />
At the end of the Q&amp;A, they did a drawing based on ticket numbers for a bunch of people could go out to dinner with Ronan Harris. The other EQers won one of the draws.<br />
<br />
So my question is, where is the post about the dinner, Mr Safehouse Regular? Nosey Inquiring minds want to know! (If you're crashed out with the band right now I guess it's ok.. but you better make with some details when you wake up. :P)<br />

The fact that chances are 10 years ago, I'd probably have been enough into the alternative music scene that I'd have some @#%$ clue who Jhani was talking about, and I could say &quot;oh man, I wish I could have gone&quot; or something like that.  <br />
<br />
What makes me anguished is the fact that Jhani is the same age as me, and so I can't even blame it on being old!  <br />
<br />
I do know the lyrics to every song Raffi has ever sung, however.  And I can do most of the Wiggles dances by heart.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alternative? You are an old man, that's really an insult. I overplayed VNV nation during an appropriate period of my life, so many of the good songs don't have the force they used to have (Saviour , Solitary, Standing, Dark Angel...), but it's good stuff.<br />
<br />
Alternative is now the term for stuff like Pdiddy and blink182.<br />
<br />
ps: You all need to learn yourselves some Apoptygma Berzerk if you like techno/electronica. See my sig. I'd include it again in this post for the purpose of the link, but I think Glip would be upset.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Failkan</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoy Apoptygma, but they don't seem to have the same... depth of feeling and meaning that VNV does.  maybe it's just a personal thing; some of Apop feels really commercial, as if it's been written to sell.  I don't get that vibe from VNV.  if anything, meeting Ronan and talking to him deepened the meaning I derive from his music.  all the VNV tracks you listed are good, Prenn, some of my favorites.  can't forget Kingdom, Honour, and a whole buncha stuff off Futureperfect, though - Genesis, Beloved, Airships, Fearless, Holding On, Structure.  heck, each song individually, and the album as a whole, are good.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">10-23-03, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing about APB is the surprising variety between the songs, very few sound remotely alike. Their (His? I read the biography, but I can't really tell if it's still two guys or just one) remix of Fade to Black is simply beautiful. Eclipse, spiritual reality, until the end of the world, paranoia (admittedly I prefer a remix to the original), and the rest for the most part is energizing, uplifting music. There's a few that are slow and depressing like Burning Heretics and another that I can't recall offhand, with my music collection unavailable to me :/. <br />
<br />
VNV nation is definitely a heavier, darker tone. I don't know how I didn't list Serial Killer, probably the most dramatic song I've heard by them. Strangely, one of their older ones too. I won't claim to have heard all of either band's songs, though I think I've heard more VNV nation (through futureperfect, the newer stuff I havn't gotten) than APB. There's sort of limboy area in the chronological middle of their music, with stuff like Voice, and Cold, and a couple of other that sound nothing like the earlier serial killer or the later futureperfect and the songs you and i listed in this thread. The music instills sorrow, or anger, or loss, or remembrance of scenarios similar to the lyrics. Things that you still can't let yourself forget, even if you want to. I definitely can associate VNV nation with a time in my life, which I can't really do with APB. Overplaying music really angers me, it'd be nice if our brains forgave us and we could get that 'fresh feel' back again.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's the difference between loving life and praising the fallen. You need both. Likeminded emotions probably draw on oneanother, when you're happy, you don't want to be sad, and when you're sad, you want remembrance that you're not alone.<br />
