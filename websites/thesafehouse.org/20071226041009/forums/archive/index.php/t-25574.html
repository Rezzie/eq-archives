<br />
China has banned anime from prime time television. Starting September 1, animation produced outside of China will be barred from TV from 5 to 8 p.m., freeing the space for struggling Chinese studios.<br />
<br />
Pokemon and American series like The Simpsons have become &quot;hugely popular&quot; with Chinese youth, according to the Associated Press. Communist leaders are reportedly frustrated that foreign productions have dominated Chinese TV despite efforts to build up local animation studios.<br />
<br />
The foreign animation ban coincides with a larger effort by Chinese President Hu Jintao to strengthen government controls over television, movies, magazines, and web sites.<br />
<br />
Amid an influx of anime in 2000, Chinese TV stations were ordered to limit foreign animation on their broadcast schedule. In 2004, the government specified that at least 60% of prime cartoons had to be produced in China. Recently, TV stations were told to limit all foreign programming and have their hosts use fewer English words on the air.<br />
<br />
In February, Chinese regulators banned shows that mixed animation and live action, such as Blue's Clues and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.<br />
<br />
In April, the government forced the cancellation of Rolling Stone China after its first issue. The magazine was a joint venture that incorporated the Chinese-produced Audio Visual World, as foreign magazines have not been granted licenses for Chinese distribution in several years.<br />

<br />
All radio stations must ensure that 35% of their popular musical selections are Canadian each week.<br />
Air time for Canadian programs<br />
Private television stations and networks (e.g. CTV, Global,TVA) and ethnic TV stations must achieve a yearly Canadian content level of:<br />
<br />
60% overall, measured during the day – i.e. 6AM and midnight; <br />
50%, measured during the evening broadcast period – i.e. between 6PM and midnight. <br />
CBC must ensure that at least 60% of its overall schedule, measured during the day – i.e. 6AM to midnight, is Canadian.<br />
<br />
Requirements for pay-tv, specialty and pay-per-view services vary and are set by conditions of licence. Check decisions for individual services for details (Search).<br />
<br />
Broadcasters can claim a 125% to 150% time credit for Canadian dramas when they're aired during peak viewing hours (7PM to 11PM).<br />

I knew Canadian TV sucked, I just wasn't sure why until now.<br />
<br />
*edit*  Nothing against Canadians, it's just, your TV sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">08-15-06, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on a screwy point scale as to whether something counts as Canadian content.  For example, the 'La Femme Nikita' TV series counts as Canadian content because it fills enough requirements.<br />
<br />
I think Highlander: the series and the Stargate TV series count as Canadian content, and I wouldn't be surprised if the new 'Blade' TV series on Spike TV does too.  Considering the airplay Andromeda gets I'd have to bet it's counted as canadian content as well.<br />
<br />
Some of the dubs/voicework from the Canadian animation studios might even have enough points to qualify as Canadian content (InuYasha, Hamtaro, Beast Wars, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam series, etc.).<br />
<br />
I remember canadian singer Brian Adams had a popular song a while back ('Everything I Do I Do It For You', the theme song from the Kevin Costner 'Robin Hood' movie) that didn't count as 'Canadian content' even though he performed it and co-wrote the lyrics.<br />
<br />
It should also be noted we still get CNN, FOX, NBC, ABC, CBS, etc.</div></div><hr />
