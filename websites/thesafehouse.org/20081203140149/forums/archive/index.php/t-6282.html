I'm resisting the urge to buy the game till after the semester ends (im a student) or i might not pass some classes. Hehe. Its just those pics are so cool. Im breaking down.<br />
<br />
Anyway i was gonna make a Blaster but according to what i have read they are the most common. I decided im gonna make an Invulnerability/Super Strength Tanker. I have toyed around with the Hero Planner and was wondering if anybody here had some insight regarding the Super Strength  Power Set. I am going to focus mainly on the Defensive Powers but Im not sure which of the Super Stength powers would be good and i cant test them by playing the game (yet). <br />
<br />
If anybody would be so kind as to share their experiences/opinions with/on Punch, Haymaker, Hand Clap, Knock Out Blow, and Hurl (and any others you would like to comment on, maybe even from the Power Pool Sets like Flurry or Whirlwind) it would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A damn good friend of mine from beta, Phantom, played tankers almost exclusively. I know he was underwhelmed with teh superstrength powerset compared to energy melee or whatever it's called now. Never played it myself so I can't tell from personal experience though.</div></div><hr />

Here is a link to the Tanker forums so you can do some research and planning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CogginsEQ</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll chime in as the Raging Italian(my char) is a invul/super strength tanker.  Now, I am only level 9 but here is what I have so far:<br />
<br />
Invulnerability:<br />
Resist Physical Damage(auto smash/lethal damage reducer)<br />
Invulnerability(toggle smash/lethal damage reducer)<br />
<br />
Super Strength:<br />
Jab(minor dmg, chance to disorientate target)<br />
Punch(moderate dmg, chance to knockdown target)<br />
Taunt(taunt a foe to attack you)<br />
<br />
Leaping:<br />
Jump Kick(dmg attack that may knockback target)<br />
<br />
<br />
I chose those two as they most fit my character, not for any &quot;best skill set&quot; reason.  But for the most part im very satisfied!  <br />
<br />
Invul is super cool as you get a couple different damage mitigation skills that are auto, so always on.  Also you get invulnerability which is a toggle that increases defense against smashing(clubs, fists) and lethal(I believe guns fall under this category).  Also, yes the invulnerability power and the auto resists stack together, although you cant use invulnerability in conjunction with some of the other toggle powers later.  Its not a flashy set, but its useful.<br />
<br />
Super Strength is also not too bad.  The moves have a nice re-use time and allow me to disorientate/knockback baddies.  I fought a boss guy that conned orange to me, that I solo'd without  even getting touched at level 8 cause with jump kick(knockback) and Punch(knockback) by the time it took the mob to get up I had landed a couple more attacks to him, and another knockback power was up to smash him down again.<br />
<br />
Leaping.  Im satisfied so far with Jump Kick, it works well for me cause I hear that if you use a weapon(katana for example) and you jump kick, it puts the weapon away and takes time to draw it again.  With super strength, I only use fists so I dont need to worry about the re-draw time, just the normal use time of jump kick.<br />
<br />
I like the set as a tanker cause it fits my character, but my brother made a stone/stone tanker and he has some pretty sick damage.  I hope this helps some, and if I have messed up the info someone please correct me :)<br />
<br />
P.S. Remember, im only level 9 so far, just trying to help though!</div></div><hr />
