Well then, I think that's all. I'll be reviewing the series I watch, limited to the stuff fansubbed not raws. If people want to give their opinions, feel free. Any questions, feel free to ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">12-16-05, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Major 2nd Season - B+<br />
<br />
I felt that this series came off on a rather weak start. It was one of my favorite sports anime before. It is a story of Goro who plays Baseball. In the first season, he was in the little leagues, and now he's in High School. <br />
<br />
It's hard to talk about this series without first season spoilers. But all the characters look appropiate even though Goro looks much older than the rest. The first episode is cliche, so I'm a little disappointed. But I doubt the manga would have lasted 60+ volumes if it stays this way. The first season has a high recommendation from me, but I'll watch this some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">12-16-05, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">King of Fighters: Another Day - C<br />
<br />
This was a rather odd episode. I knew what to expect, because I love the KOF games. But the show didn't seem very interesting and largely pointless, and too fast paced. To be expected, I guess, but the only thing going for it, the fighting, wasn't all that impressive for the first episode. It was some KoF fighting goodness, but nothing spectacular. Maybe the future fights will be better. I'll keep watching this as a KoF fan. All others may not be interested.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I can see, I don't think Girl Meets Girl is anything like the title sounds. I could be wrong, though.<br />
<br />
And yes, it's related to KoF game. I don't think it's meant to be much of a story other than an excuse to fight. As for Papillion Rose, I guess Sailor Moon Hentai is something like it... For one thing, there was no graphic sex scenes. But all the magicial moves, etc were sexual in nature. If I had to call it anything, it would be a erotic Sailor Moon parody.<br />
<br />
In any case, I could NOT stop laughing during the show. I don't know at all how the TV series will work, but that's part of why I'm looking forward to it so much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I believe it's just one episode.  A summary and then a sort of short epilogue tacked on to the end.  IIRC the last episode of SEED Destiny was &quot;Final&quot;, so given the new epilogue, it's Plus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Girl meets Girl, I didn't recognize the title immediately. But when I went to the official web site, I knew what it was about right away. <br />
<br />
I read a bit of the manga before. Basically, a ufo hits a guy and turns him into a chick. He had a crush on a girl before and still did as a chick. Hilarity ensues as he makes  chick friends and still has feelings for the girl.<br />
<br />
I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped, but I do look forward to the anime a bit now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I recently watched this 30 minute long OVA. It's by Ken Akamatsu, so Love Hina, Negima, AI Love You, etc fans will enjoy this show almost a given. The OAV is very, very fast paced. Someone's always talking, something's always going on the screen, never a moment to relax. While I'm not a big Akamatsu fan, this was an exception. It's high pace and constant insanity was a fun thing to see.<br />
<br />
The story itself is your typical whiny boy. Santa (in the form of a cute girl) visists him to give him good luck and make him believe in Santa again. The process from not believing in Santa to believing is irrational and takes a lot for the granted, but I enjoyed it anyway.<br />
<br />
The ending when they talked about his parents was a little touching, though. There's a LOT of fanservice in this show (panty shots, nude t&amp;a, etc.) as typical of Akamatsu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Love Hina: Again was a terrible followup to Love Hina.<br />
<br />
With a sudden need to see panties and jiggly breasts (there wasn't a single panty shot in LH, and most of the time the girls were well-covered in towels), a totally throw-away plot involving, among other things: an insectious sister, a dues-ex 'omg everything you remembered about your childhood was wrong', aforementioned TON of fanservice, everyone suddenly announding their love for Keiichi, comparatively shoddy animation, lackluster music, and just a host of other things that made it feel less like a storyline sequel than an alternate-reality OVA cash-cow spinoff. It just WASN'T good. <br />
<br />
The Spring Movie was where it all started to go wrong. With a campy song suddenly sprouting up in the middle of nowhere, jiggly Naru in a leaf-bikini (because letting her clothes dry didn't make sense... WTF?!?!), a throw-away new character (Hi! Bye!) and a noted change in animation style, all this lackluster-ness carried over to Again, just amplified.<br />
<br />
The Winter Movie, on the other hand, not only felt like a true storyline sequel, but with a good story, crisp animation, decent music and overall correct 'mood', can even function as a stand-alone movie to someone that's never seen the series.<br />

I watched the second episode of Itsudatte My Santa. God, it was so horrible that I could not stop laughing. There's no story to speak of, hardly any fanservice this time, nothing interesting at all. The dialogue was so stupid that I lost a few IQ points from it.<br />

Watched two episodes, and while it not high-drama, it's just a cute little fast-paced show. No reason to h8. Gotta love the super-quick conflict resolution, people stretching out the drama annoy me.<br />

<br />
I cannot believe this. Cure Black and White are HUGE hits among Otaku and Children. This is like... replacing Goku when DBZ arrives. Unbelievable. And looking at their UGLY outfits, I'm losing my interest in the series. I'm not expecting much from the series anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">12-28-05, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just watched School Rumble OVA 01. It's a fun series to watch. I was a little suprised, although I don't know if it's the impression the show made on me, or just simple coincidence, but I felt like I wasn't missing anything by not watching it in so long.<br />
<br />
Normally if I stop watching something then pick it up a few months later, I feel lost and don't remember what the characters are supposed to be like or what happened before in the story. But this time, I felt like everyone was acting as they usually do. Maybe it's a sign of well-done development? Having this feeling was somewhat odd because my impression with the TV run wasn't that it was great and left a huge impression, I just thought it was a fun show to pass the time.<br />
<br />
Little things like Eri's reaction to Harima's accidental peeking in the spring bath, I would normally react like... why didn't she do anything about it knowing Eri's &quot;stereotypical&quot; classification of personality. But this time, I felt it was natural how she reacted to it and how composed albeit embarassed she was through it. As if she knew that Harima probably didn't mean it.<br />
<br />
Well all in all, I just found this interesting. The show is the same old School Rumble goodness, and I still recommend it to people who like stuff like Azumanga Daioh. Lots of pretty girls and comedy.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, one of my favorite shows too. I really loved the atmosphere and philosophy they were trying to convey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-08-06, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fate//Stay Night - A<br />
<br />
Ok, probably the show I am most looking forward to, so I'm happy it's here now. Fate//Stay Night is based on the ero-game of the same name, and in the same type of world as Shingetsutan Tsukihime (Lunar Legend Tsukihime in the US).<br />
<br />
The anime seems to follow the game. I noticed a lot of things were rushed through, and understandably so. There was a lot of conversation between Archer and Rin, but they didn't even talk this time around.<br />
<br />
Some of the events are not in the order as the game, instead jumping around a bit. However, these are all very understandable. It's blindingly obvious that the anime will revolve around Shirou and Saber, so they will likely skip over a lot of backstory of the other magicians and servants, which is pretty disappointing. But Saber is my favorite character so it's all good in the end, I suppose.<br />
<br />
The animation is pretty good, and I like the character designs. I like the pace of the story. It looks like this will be an anime to watch out for.<br />
<br />
By the way, even though it's based on a ero-game, it's not like KimiNozo, Kanon, etc. It's very different, so don't come expecting such. The only similarity is that the girls are pretty.</div></div><hr />

I just finished watching Le Portrait de Petite Cossette. It's like someone decided to base a series on the ending of NGE, with spirits and curses instead of mecha. (Complete with giant eyeballs and bleeding crosses!)<br />
 <br />
Not that it stopped me from making a new desktop wallpaper.... <br />
(yes, I know, I'm a total minimalist when it comes to my desktop theme)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, I really liked Le Portrait de Petit Cossette. My third time through, I could finally understand 100% what was going on, unlike NGE where... you could watch it 200 times and still have no idea what was going on.<br />
<br />
Really a fun show to think about. I really liked that you could actually think about the show and use evidence derived from the show to prove it, rather than NGE's using evidence derived from outside sources (mythology, religion, gonzoism, etc).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Another off topic thing- Kita~he ~Diamond Dust Drops~ (known as Diamond Daydreams in the USA) will begin it's release in Feb. I recommend it for fans of soft romance. The stories within it are really sweet and heartwarming, and the ending was even more heartwarming. It's another niche title so those are always worth supporting, anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
King of Fighters - Another Day - C<br />
<br />
Same grade as the first episode. If you liked the first episode, you'll like this one. Mostly just KoF service, no plot or anything. Small fighting sequences but nothing spectacular.<br />
<br />
The episodes are short and there's only one more so I might as well watch the last one. It's not particularly good, but it's fun to see the KoF fighters animated, I guess.<br />
<br />
Kagihime Monogatari Eikyu Alice Rondo - D-<br />
<br />
Ok, this was pretty bad. It appears to be a mahou shoujo, but doesn't appear to be aimed at the usual target - young girls. It appears to be aimed at older crowds. For instance, the transformation sequence shows tit and ass enchancements. Everyone has big boobs. The outfits are ugly, imo. The artwork is plain. The characters are one demisional.<br />
<br />
The story is not exactly based on Alice in Wonderland as it seems to imply. Actually, I'm not sure what the hell is based on Alice in Wonderland other than the name. First, Lewis Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland, I know, it's one of my favorite books. But in the anime, someone named Dogson made it?<br />
<br />
Maybe it's copyright and all that jazz, but two books (Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass), everyone's Alice, they are trying to make a third book in the series. That's what the story revolves around. Magical Girl Alices are stealing each other's stories to make the third book, Endless Alice. The main character is Alice. I think I'm going to have to copy and paste Alice in this review.<br />
<br />
There appears to be minimal fanservice, and badly done to boot. (How the hell do you get fanservice wrong, anyway?) I advise you guys to steer way clear of this unless the premise somehow sounds interesting, or if you're interested in witnessing a five train wreck of an anime.<br />
<br />
Also, Nameless (the people who translated the anime) did a horrid job. Don't bother.</div></div><hr />

Hmm.. now that weekly series are releasing again, I'm happy. Had damn near run out of things to watch. Now I can sit back and wait for Mai Otome, Rozen Maiden Traumend, Lyrical Nanoha A's, Gokujo Seitokai, Da Capo SS, Bleach, Yakitate Japan.... Ah, if only they would release quicker and give me something to watch. I am quickly running out of completed series that appeal to me, and hate to pick up anymore unfinished series.<br />
 <br />
Oh, and damn Tsubasa Chronicle. Not cool ending all of a sudden after 26 episodes, then making me wait untill April for new episodes. Grrr. If I woulda known the series wasn't finished, I woulda waited to watch it.<br />
 <br />
And on a lighter note, helium.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first half of the episode was decent. It felt rushed somehow, but overall okay. The second half was, well.. not quite to my liking, I guess. That's not to say it was bad, but I didn't feel it was good either. Either way, it's inconsequental &quot;filler&quot; so it's not a big deal.<br />
<br />
The real complaint is the animation. What happened?! It's like their budget dropped at the end. I hope they improve it for DVD version like Tsukuyomi did. I was a little bit annoyed by that.<br />
<br />
And I wanted to talk about some of last season's releases, for those who haven't picked them up...<br />
<br />
Aria the Animation was wonderful, on it's 11th fansubbed episode now. I recommend this one for a calm and enjoyable anime.<br />
<br />
I dropped Black Cat and Blood+ because they weren't entertaining, imo. Also dropped Canvas 2 due to too much cliche and nothing to drive it forward.<br />
<br />
Jigoku Shoujo has it's 8th episode fansubbed. Honestly, I felt this show could be great. But for the first seven episodes, it fell flat on it's face every time. Nobody had a situation that warrants sacrificing themselves for a eternity in hell. But they did it anyway. However, the 8th episode shows a change in direction, and it did improve quite a bit by the 14th episode imo, but there are parts I don't understand so I'll probably have to wait until the fansubs come out.<br />
<br />
Mai-Otome has been entertaining, I don't know what else to say about it. It's about as fun as Mai-Hime.<br />
<br />
I stopped watching Noein, but not due to quality. It felt hard to remember the series because so much happens, and we're still in the dark about most things as of 4th episode. I'm waiting for more of the series to be subbed to watch. As of the 4th episode, I found it highly entertaining.<br />
<br />
Shakugan no SHANA has been mediocre. I don't know why I keep watching it. At times it can be fun, but the rest have been rather monotonous. I like Shana's design, but that's about it.<br />
<br />
Paradise kiss has been enjoyable. Still a lot of angst and all that stuff, but i adore the art.<br />
<br />
Ginban Kaleidoscope dropped for lack of focus. Lamune dropped for annoying guy and no decent women. Karin in between being dropped and continued, nothing excellent so far, but not terrible.<br />
<br />
Rozen Maiden has been great as the first season. I really enjoy it. The conflicts between the sisters have been sad to watch. A highly recommended series as whole.<br />
<br />
To Heart 2 is also in between. Not great, but not horrible. Solty Rei dropped for unoriginality and redudancy.<br />
<br />
Mushishi is absolutely BRILLANT. Best series of the season, hands down. There is no comparision, it is a series which all anime that explores morality, humans, and allthat stuff, will be compared to.<br />
<br />
Capeta dropped for bad CG's and char designs. Happy Seven dropped for being all fluff.</div></div><hr />

First, I don't recommend Team Tomari's subs of this show. I suggest waiting for the next group to fansub it.<br />
<br />
On to the actual episode. It wasn't very good, for the most part. Mostly because it was a &quot;introduction&quot; episode. They were trying to explain why the guy became a girl.<br />
<br />
It was pretty funny what happened at the end. The premise seems interesting, and it feels like the story will turn out to be pretty good. The opening of the episode was very revealing. The main point of the opening, to me, was that the show might be pretty serious. I'm sure there will be funny fanservice, and random plotless episodes, but there's a main story. Which is a good thing with this show.<br />
<br />
And the next episode previews give lots to look forward to. He has to actually deal with being a girl, and we get to see it all! Haha.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to this episode. I don't really have much to say for the first one, but no doubt I'll have a more solid review next episode. Looks like you'll enjoy this one Sollon.</div></div><hr />

All things considered (given the game is massively huge) this series is excellent so far. It does rush through things but gives enough of a general idea of what's going on.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, Saber makes her appearance! Whee! It's no wonder Rin is so infatuated with Saber. She's so awesome. I hope they make a Fate/Hollow Ataraxia anime too, :D<br />

Definitely a great series from what I've seen so far. I hope it continues to get better.</div></div><hr />

I won't be giving this one a review. Someone else can do it, who's a fan of mecha anime. I watch all genres, but this type I can't bear to sit through.

This story revolves around a young boy and girl who are hospitalized. It appears to be a romance centered in a hosptial setting. There seems to be some life and death drama. And I'm a bit disappointed, I almost got to see a 16? year old boy reading piles and piles of porn magazines while crying and thinking about a old man with a cane. Too bad, that would have been funny. Still amusing, anyway.<br />
<br />
The story feels very rushed in the beginning. I don't know how to feel about the girl. Overall, the show is pretty above average, but the next few episodes will be the decieding factor. The girl has a fatal illness, the boy has a temporary illness, but he will be hospitalized for 3 months or so.<br />

I did like the show, overall, but am hesistant to praise or criticize it at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I usually only give one or two shows a high recommendation. That's how good this series is as of the third episode. The main players are being introduced, with this episode introducing Ilya and Berserker (who, IMO, is probably one of the most badass-looking anime characters ever).<br />
<br />
While I love Saber, these two are my favorite combination. The small childish Ilya with the huge, scary looking Berserker standing ten times her height. I love the fanart of them, especially where she is sitting on Berserker's shoulders. They really are a interesting combination.<br />
<br />
My only real disappointment is that we did not get to see Tohsaka Rin's internal dialogue when Saber attacked. Not to give away too much, but the game was much more detailed in that aspect. It was also a very good portrayal of the beginning of Rin's feelings for Saber, how she, like Emiya, was talking about what a stunning and dignified beauty Saber was.<br />
<br />
I don't know how obvious they will make it in the anime, but just to answer the question before it's asked, yes, Rin is gay for Saber.<br />
<br />
Attached is one of my favorite pictures of Ilya and Berserker. Also attached is a figure kit of her and Berserker. I wanted to buy this kit but I don't have nearly the skill to paint Berserker, even if I could do Ilya. Ah, well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not exactly sure why I'm giving this such a high grade. In my head, I don't really like it, but I most certainly enjoyed watching the first two episodes.<br />
<br />
It's set in a world where some people can use magic. One family consisting of three sisters and one brother, the sisters can use magic, the brother doesn't know about it. Suddenly, someone who has a curse only Haruo (the brother) can get rid of appears.<br />
<br />
It feels like it will be a harem of the same vein as Love Hina, Maburaho, etc. But so far, they've only introduced two girls. Not counting one of the sister's complex about him, although it's nothing sexual in nature it seems.<br />
<br />
It is definitely a very fast paced show. I think this was probably the real reason why I enjoyed the first two episodes. There was always something going on. As soon as the show slows down, I think I will drop it as I don't particularly like the animation and character designs. But I'll probably deciede in the next two episodes.<br />
<br />
As for who would enjoy this series, I would say Love Hina crowd would. I would generally say that this series, as of the first two episodes, is significantly better than Love Hina (Sollon may want to check it out). Or anyone into harem anime would probably enjoy this. It's wacky and not serious at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would it make sense to see fate even if ya never seen an episode b4?<br />
<br />
Yes it would. The anime begins exactly where the game began. Tsukihime only took place in the same world, they have no relation.<br />
<br />
You would appreciate it better having played the game, and knowing all the internal dialogue, but it is absolutely not neccessary at all.<br />
<br />
EDIT: For instance, in episode three, you see that Rin used one of her &quot;commands&quot; already. This is not said why in the anime, at least not yet. But in the game, there was a farily long (one to one and a half episodes worth) of dialogue between Rin and Archer and some plot developments. This happened during the time Rin summoned Archer, but you only get to see him get summoned and making tea for her (which was actually pretty funny). From the onset, Rin treated Archer like an actual servant (i.e. maid) so I laughed a bit at that scene.<br />
<br />
Despite all that, only watching the anime is more than enough. You don't feel like you've missed anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Episode four, and the final review, says that this is the best anime currently released on fansub this season. This fourth episode was particularly brutal, with the introduction of Berserker and Ilya. The true identy of Berserker is truly awesome, to say the least.<br />
<br />
The fight was not as excellent as I've come to hope, but it's only the beginning of the story. Lots of major players still have yet to be introduced. But one big point of this episode was that it will not pull any punches. This is good news. We are in for quite a ride with this series, and many swirling emotions are bound to occur. Some truly sad moments, heartwarming, funny, and almost epic-like tale to be told.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to enjoying this series immensely.<br />
<br />
Magikano C+<br />
<br />
I'm going to be dropping this series. Watching two episodes of Magikano in a row definitely skewed my perspective. With the third episode, I had time to think about it. It's pretty cliche. Not a bad thing for those into this genre. Love Hina/comedy harem types will like this, probably.<br />
<br />
Going off topic now to older series. I watched Shakugan no Shana catching up from episode 12 to 16. And good god, did they just tell three episodes worth of serious drama involving a lot of deaths, how shana became the Flame Haze, her childhood, based on the fact that she likes melon bread?<br />
<br />
I **** you not. The conversation went (the Mistes guy) &quot;I wonder why Shana loves melon bread so much&quot; FLASHBACK, Shana pre-Flame Haze, her friends dying, leaving, badass people show up, fights, fights. (in conclusion) this is why Shana likes melon bread.<br />
<br />
What the ****, dude!<br />
<br />
Aria the Animation has a second season in the making! Episode 11 was very heartwarming, a very highly recommended atmosphere show.<br />
<br />
Ah! My Goddess fans: pay attention. Fansubs of 25/26th DVD-only episodes came out. <br />
<br />
Yakitate! Japan Episode 51/52 were funny as hell. The bread that CHANGES HISTORY! OMG!<br />
<br />
Most of my time this last week was spent watching 2x2=Shinobuden. Such a fun show, I really enjoyed it. The opening song is so fun. It's highly recommended that anyone pick it up when it gets released by RightStuf, called Ninja Nonsense in the US. It's a Parody anime in the lines of Excel Saga.<br />
<br />
Also watched Jungle wa Itsumo Hare Nochi Guu, the new Kaleido Star OVA - Legend of the Phoenix which was INCREDIBLE! But one thing that pisses me off is the LE I got with the DVD, a figure of Layla, was horrible. I lose :/ Also been playing Clannad, been postponing playing this one for quite some time.</div></div><hr />

This appears to be another harem type. Very similar to Magikano, also airing this season. Instead of magicians, this one has samurais, ninjas, etc. Same basic harem plotline. A childhood friends, the guy being from a ninja family of 400 years protecting the girl who's his childhood friend's family.<br />
<br />
A tale about love, rivalry, stupid plot points, crappy action sequences, overdone humor on Shakespearean level commences! Or something like that.<br />
<br />
I didn't dislike it, but I have far better series to watch right now, even within the same genre.<br />
<br />
Lemon Angel Project C-<br />
<br />
Nothing spectacular at all. The animation was terrible. I'm pretty sure the selling point is the music, but I can't comment on that. However, from what I hear, it's not good either. The plot is very abstract.<br />
<br />
The story revovles around the disappearance of the Lemon Angel singing group who broke up. Through some strange means I cannot understand, they are trying to revive that group, using different cast. But there were a lot of points in the episode that I could not understand. It seemed like they were a virtual group, but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
I was disappointed because I was somewhat looking forward to this. I appreciate pop idol anime types, as Full Moon wo Saga****e is one of my favorites. Also the inclusion of Minmay of Macross was a fun aspect to me. Odd as that may be.<br />
<br />
I'll check one more episode out, but it seems to be reallly poorly executed.<br />
<br />
Yomigaeru Sora -Rescue Wings- B<br />
<br />
I was a little suprised by this show. By no means is the first episode anything truly capitivating, but it does set up a lot of potentional for a good story. The story revolves around Air Rescue on helicoptors, for things like plane crashes, etc.<br />
<br />
Our main character wanted to be a jet fighter pilot, but got the short end of the draw, and was moved into Air Rescue. He wasn't too particularly euthastic about this transfer. This is all the story has been presented thus far, pretty much. But from the art, and the style of storytelling, it seems to be a interesting sleeper hit for this season.<br />
<br />
Further episodes will need to be seen to make a better decision. It certainly seems to be very geared to aviatonics otaku, with a lot of helicoptor and plane 3D fanservice which is quite beyond me as I have a hard enough time seeing the difference between a Boeing and a Cessna :p<br />
<br />
But I'm looking forward to the second episode.</div></div><hr />

Soldats just released the rest of Monster. Man, that was such a great series. The ending was mind-blowing. Normally, i'd call it something of a cop-out ending, but when you think about it, there's no other way it could have ended.<br />
<br />
And it was incredibly brutal. 74 episodes, holy ****. Urusawa is incredible. I don't know how he does this ****. I can't wait for 20th Century Boys the anime to come out.<br />
<br />
Johan looked incredible in these last episodes. You could really see his emotions inside his eyes. Absolutely brillant. I'm sad it's at it's end, though, I will miss it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-13-06, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going to go over a few series not reviewed. I came here to praise one series, but I may as well do the rest while I'm here.<br />
<br />
Yomigaeru Sora -Rescue Wings- A+ HIGH RECOMMENDATION<br />
<br />
The first episode was mostly introduction, but the next two were mind-blowing. The 3D helicoptors and planes are incredible, something I never thought I'd say about anime that mixes 3D and 2D.<br />
<br />
It has a very strong and realistic story. The story revolves around a man who is a helicoptor pilot on an Air Rescue team. It shows them going out to disasters and the things they do. It's very realistic and BRUTAL AS HELL. I mean, downright gut-wrenching tear-inducing EXTREMELY depressing brutality. Any more, it'd be a fatality.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this one to anyone that's a fan of anime with a strong story. I came into this show expecting to drop it, but got my mind blown away. I cannot praise this show enough.<br />
<br />
Binchou-tan B<br />
<br />
If you liked Aria or Ichigo Mashimaro, you'll love Binchou-tan. Very calm and relaxing. Extremely cute. <br />
<br />
REC B<br />
<br />
I was suprised, it's a very adult anime. The two main characters develop a love interest and have sex in the first episode. It's a good sign of the maturity of the anime, but I can't say much more yet. It's about a girl who wants to be a voice actress.<br />
<br />
That's all I really have to say. I just came to praise Yomigaeru Sora -Rescue Wings- so that everyone who let this slip under their radar has a chance to pick it up. I almost did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">02-23-06, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fate/Stay Night A+ High Recommendation<br />
<br />
Episode four, and the final review, says that this is the best anime currently released on fansub this season. This fourth episode was particularly brutal, with the introduction of Berserker and Ilya. The true identy of Berserker is truly awesome, to say the least.<br />
<br />
The fight was not as excellent as I've come to hope, but it's only the beginning of the story. Lots of major players still have yet to be introduced. But one big point of this episode was that it will not pull any punches. This is good news. We are in for quite a ride with this series, and many swirling emotions are bound to occur. Some truly sad moments, heartwarming, funny, and almost epic-like tale to be told.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to enjoying this series immensely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy crap this show kicks a lot of ass!!! Lots of interesting concepts...</div></div><hr />

Probably because it was licensed early, before it started airing, by Geneon.  So you will need to use other means besides the standard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Geneon USA is funding the show, so yeah it was licensed just about the second someone said, &quot;hey, let's make a fate/stay night anime&quot; haha. I'm pretty happy about that, it means the delay will be minimized, hopefully. I want to own the DVD of Fate, but I hope they improve the animation for the DVD.<br />
<br />
BTW Saber's transformation sequence in episode 8 made me cream my pants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's usually the case when they are announced so early like that.  Didn't know for sure though as it's not a series I'm watching.</div></div><hr />

Much like the Disgaea preview :P?<br />
<br />
Oh btw be sure to check out the Disgaea preview it is pretty cool looking. The animation is really nice IMO.<br />
<br />
Oh and Nekoaoi &gt;&lt;. =^_^= :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then that would be why. :b<br />
Any news on when they are actually releasing the DVD's then?  Or was what you were trying to say is that thats a ways down because the bought the license before the Episodes were even made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-28-06, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, don't expect to see the DVD's until the last R2 dvd gets released. Japan fears reverse importation for cheaper prices etc.<br />
<br />
I'd say it will be on dvd around.. There's 4 months to go on TV run, then the dvd releases so.. About winter/spring 2008 most likely.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;alternate means&quot; comment, it means not everything stops getting subbed when licensed. Google is your friend here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's licensed, whee~ Kamichu! and Ichigo Mashimaro are confirmed licensed by Geneon!<br />
<br />
I am SO glad that Geneon got both of them. We're looking at an awesome release, more likely than not.<br />
<br />
Kamichu is about a Middle School girl who one day became God. (Not the Christian type of God, the &quot;God of Rock, God of Trees, God of Rubber Floats, type of thing&quot;) She doesn't know what she is the God of. She woke up one day and went, &quot;Oh.... I guess I'm God now.&quot; And told her friends so the whole town respects her as a God now. moe~ Yurie.<br />
<br />
It's a pretty incredible show. It's very, very Miyazaki-like. If you liked Spirited Away, you'll adore Kamichu. There are 16 episodes in the series.<br />
<br />
Ichigo Mashimaro is about four elementary girls and a college girl just doing cute things. All the girls here are MOE~ but anyone who wants a relaxing anime to watch and enjoy will love this one. Really, anyone who likes Kamichu will like Ichigo Mashimaro to an extent.</div></div><hr />

That, and I had completely forgotten about it. I was cruising online, saw a fansub group I considered to be good had released up to the 14th episode, and figured it was about time.</div></div><hr />
