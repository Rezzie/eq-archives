<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm surprised at the (apparent) lack of interest in this series. I loved the heck out of the first season, and the second season is shaping up to be as good as the first. Perhaps y'all read the manga already, which would leave me quite in the dust, but eh, I'm enjoying the anime a lot. Six eps have been subbed to my knowledge (I follow wannabe fs, they might be behind some, I dunno). This latest episode had me cracking up the whole episode. Lots of character developments, as well.<br />
<br />
Much :heart for Yakumo, as usual ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am enjoying it. As I enjoyed the 1st.<br />
<br />
Though I really want Harima and &quot;Queen&quot; to get together but it probably wont happen &quot;sigh&quot; :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The character dynamics in School Rumble are absoluely wonderful. There have been many cases of &quot;he likes her, she likes that other guy, that guy likes this other girl&quot; type of thing in anime, but I felt it was well-done in this series.<br />
<br />
Not only are they slowly changing their relationships with each other, this change is continously reflected upon in further episodes, rather than leaving it as a standalone event as most series would.<br />
<br />
My absolutely favorite character is Harima. I really love Yakumo too, especially when she's around Harima. It's so sweet to watch her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">10-03-06, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bumping this thread, as the Second Semester is over...<br />
<br />
I'm really excited for the Third Semester/SS OVAs, as Yakumo is my favorite character, expecting a lot more character development for her soon. The last eps of SS were awesome, I'm really pleased with how they turned out- just the right balance of humor and seriousness. The character dynamics are still wonderful, even as the relationships are finally starting to settle down.<br />
<br />
Anyone else keep up with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OpZO</div><div class="date">10-05-06, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still do, eagerly awaiting season 3 and keeping up with the manga in the meantime</div></div><hr />
