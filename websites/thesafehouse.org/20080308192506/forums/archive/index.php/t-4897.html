I have had this game for a month now and i have no idea what to be.  Ive tried Champion, hunter, shadowblade, thane, scout, ranger yet i cant pick which one of them to play or what about playing another class.  I'm a roguley guy at heart and the aspect of using my EQ roguely skills to sneak up and backstab people is tempting, but bows own!!!  I know one thing i want, and that is to be good at rvr and be a class with stealth.  So if i go with bows what class?  Or strait melee?  Perhaps minstrel?  Pls give me some advice.<br />

Each realm has it's pros and cons on its assassin class so take an hour or 2 to peruse these forums, cause there are posts that highlight them specifically.<br />
I played an SB to 37 before restarting it so I can respec myself.  I love SB's.<br />
Albion gets more spec pts per level...and on a server to server basis seems to dominate the other two realms in player population.  So if you want in-game player support and advice as well as dam good assassin class potential, you might wanna check out Albion Infiltrator.</div></div><hr />
