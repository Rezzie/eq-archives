Im not sure where to get &quot;A test of Wisdom&quot; but it seems to be the main quest there with all the random body parts that drop for it... I believe i read here but couldnt find it, that it spawns a warlord? Also, i dont know if this is part of this quest, but I got Nagoz's Notes, but when i try to activate the quest it gives, it tells me that i dont have a prerequist character flag. Any Information would be awesome, thanks!</div></div><hr />

All we got was a lousy wisdom potion i think, because after we won there was a chest in room, but im not sure if it was there when we started and we just overlooked it or not. The chest contained the potion.</div></div><hr />
