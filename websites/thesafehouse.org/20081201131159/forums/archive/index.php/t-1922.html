<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brelkor</div><div class="date">10-17-03, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So i pre-ordered the new Indiana Jones dvd set a couple weeks ago off amazon.  Used the one click thing whatever.  Today i get the shipping notice but .. its being sent to Spokane, not LA!!  crap!  I being an idiot forgot to update my amazon shipping info after moving.  Hopefully it gets returned so amazon can give me my money back or re-ship it.  I had it at a good deal too.<br />
<br />
And then, my boss asks me to work saturday... when i will be nice and hung over.  thanks!  <br />
<br />
Also, tonight i find i have a nice cute little baby fishy as my chiclids mated.  Unfortunatly he has a zero survival chance once he's big enough his parents start to notice him and i don't have a secondary tank ready for him.<br />
<br />

grats on your fish!  what kind of cichlids are they?  you could go out and get a 95qt (about 25 gallons) rubbermaid container at walmart or something for like 10 bucks to raise your little fish in and then move them back when they're big enough.  use a turkey baster to suck them out and transfer to the container.  the biggest pain in the ass though is feeding them because i think they will only take baby brine shrimp since they are egglayers which means you will probably have to start up a mini brine shrimp hatchery.  it only takes about 30 mins to do but it gets annoying once you have to do it for a month or so until you can get the babies onto flake food.  once they are decent size, you can make a little cash by selling them to the local pet stores.  good luck with the fish.</div></div><hr />

Well, not necessarily.  My mom has a 110 gallon aquarium for her cichlids.  A couple of them mated and laid eggs 3 times.  Of course, the most that ever survived at one time was 4-5, but they do have a chance if they have plenty of places to hide.  If you can, go out and buy some rocks and plants for the fish to hide in.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I bet you'll start seeing more in a couple days.    <br />

It isn't the babies that always die on me, it is the big ones.</div></div><hr />

So, in all likelyhood this little scrapper is some hybrid mutant fish that will be totally ugly.</div></div><hr />
