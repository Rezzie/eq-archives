It's neat that they're using bittorrent for patching/downloading, but it's too bad they're using their own bittorrrent client.<br />
<br />
EDIT : According to Blizzards Bittorrent FAQ , it seems bittorent will be used for the beta. Edited by: Ackar at: 3/2/04 9:55 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I was blizzard, Id force people to upload about half of what they download or the file is corrupt (like if ya try to run it before your ration is .5 or somethin).  If ya cant at least upload that, shouldnt be DL'n stuff in the first place.  <br />

Not only did they purchase Bittorrent (kinda), they purchased Brian Cohen, the creator--he works for them now.<br />
<br />
I think it was a good idea, since the guy was practically living off credit cards until somebody at Valve took notice and offered him a job. They will most likely have him programming some kind of patch distribution software for Steam.<br />
<br />
I think this will work great, even if people don't stay on it. They probably have multiple connections seeding at ~3 mb/sec (at least), so even if people are leaching or stopped downloading there should be enough bandwidth to go around.<br />
<br />
If people are forced to upload twice as much as they download than people on cable will be stuck seeding for outragious times (since we can download much faster than we can upload.<br />
<br />

look like that. To me the movie just emphasized how much<br />
better EQ2's graphics will be than WoW's. <br />
That said..I will still play wow IF it comes out  before EQ2.<br />
Which unfortunately is looking more and more likely.</div></div><hr />
