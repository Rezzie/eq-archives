I am just about done with the HE mask quest all i need to do is kill stanos.  Wanted to know how hard he hits and how many are needed for him now a' days.  Also when i spawn the general to turn the head in, is it ok if i am in SNEAK but NOT HIDE?  Been forever since i did epic and have forgotten all the details.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">06-08-03, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Long story short: Whenever doing any turn in where you have to sneak(including to spawn General) you CAN NOT have hide on or be invisible. So only have sneak on when doing the turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nalot the Rogue</div><div class="date">07-06-03, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree Soygen, if you drop hide and leave sneak up you can hand in an item (get the trade box up... DO NOT press trade) then press the HIDE button in your commands (not a hotkey) and you will be hidden when you finally press trade. You can also loot your corpse or a mob's then press hide and loot while hidden. The  key factor is to use the action button for &quot;hide&quot; - NOT a hotkey. <br />

<br />
Thats right, and i didnt think of that last time i spawned the general.<br />
That also works during casting (illusion ....) when you make a hotkey you get the message &quot;you can not use ....&quot; but the commands in the commadbox work.<br />
Not sure if there can be a problem with spawning the general, but it seems that it works when Nalot has done it bevore</div></div><hr />

Btw, using the Action Buttons Hide/Sneak is the key to our famous Gaunts Pull.  <br />
<br />
About turn-in on General, I was surprised when I spawned mine. As soon as he spawned, he maked a pet .. and I was in the General's Back but with the pet facing me !<br />
<br />
Had to ask a guildmate to pull both and FD then I handed Stanos head &quot;on the fly&quot; just as General stopped with his damn pet  <br />
<br />
HTH, HAND.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Crave Kitty</div><div class="date">07-09-03, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About how hard Stanos is...  <br />
<br />
Personally I think he's a baby pita.  I've had to kill the bastard too many times for my own good.  Stick a 65 warrior with decent equips in front of him and toss two or three clerics behind him and you'll be fine.  Throw in DPS for good measure and a quick kill.  <br />
<br />
The problems *I've* had is that he calls the entire zone to assist.  With KoS members in your party this could cause well... a lot of adds.  I've found that if you have an enchanter/clr paci then get him single using a monk to pull with Warrior tagging its all good but you have to make sure the rest of the party is far enough behind not to aggro all the wanderers and I think its important that the tank use a ranged weapon to grab Stanos but I'm not entirely positive about all of this.  Maybe I've always been too careful about the encounter.  In any case, even still I've had quite a few nasty turn outs doing this so maybe there's a better way.     Oh and paci might seem moot with a monk pulling but honestly I still think its necessary.<br />
<br />
What's fun is doing all the turn-ins and spawning him while KoS to Stanos.    Speaking of which it took me a few times to get from love to hate with that man so unless your faction is low already you won't hit KoS too fast.  He hasn't always dropped the head for me but I wouldn't call it rare.   <br />
<br />
I'm not sure exactly how hard he hits but I was told the quads 500s?  Don't quote me on that..  <br />
<br />
GL though</div></div><hr />

<br />
the difference is about 1 second, enough time for a house full of dark elves to aggro and make you lose your turn in item.  They aren't disagreeing that you have to be visible to do the turn in, they are mentioning that once you hand the item in, you can hit hide, then hit trade once the window is up.</div></div><hr />

I didnt know you had to have hide off, make the GIVE window apear then put hide back on. Is this how you do it? correct me if im wrong, i might go progress in my epic now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_StevoWevo</div><div class="date">07-10-03, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About spawning Stanos, can you have Stanos parties and kill a bunch of them at one raid for all those who want the head?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Crave Kitty</div><div class="date">07-10-03, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sneak/Hide has worked as follows for me...  When I go to turn in to lets say Stanos or the General since I'm KoS to both I get behind or on the side of them and unhide.  I make sure I don't have aggro.  I do a little jig.     I click on Stanos/General.  Yay, trade box open!  I chill.  I click trade.  I put hide back up really quick.  Now I think the only thing people are doing different is that they're clicking hide before they click trade (but the trade window is still open) in case clicking trade makes the mob face you.  Then you're assured the mob won't aggro.  Either way there's a delay.  <br />
<br />
For instance, when I spawn stanos I have to stand to the side of Anson and unhide to say &quot;I need to see stanos&quot; because he doesn't listen if he can't see you.  Then I have to rehide really fast because Stanos spawns FACING you.  There's a delay.  Its possible.<br />
<br />
And yes!  That's the wonderful part about spawning Stanos you can have Stanos Parties.  He's instantly spawned whenever someone says, &quot;I need to see stanos.&quot;<br />
<br />
About turning into the general... There's no risk of having a full house of DEs attacking you if you pull the general out using a bard or two rangers or some FDing class and do the turn in while he's walking back.  That's how I did the turn in for my hie mask and my epic its quite possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you lose both sneak and hide when you do this, which is why you drop hide only for the turn in so that sneak remains and you are indifferent.</div></div><hr />
