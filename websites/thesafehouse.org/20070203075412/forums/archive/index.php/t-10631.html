While I don't have the hard figures to prove it, I find I am dying a lot more dual wielding a dagger/sword combination versus dagger/buckler combination. But then I'm a n00b. :pulid<br />

Thanks Epsilon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">06-03-04, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me this is a classic case of different gear for different needs.  Back when I played EQ, if you may have had to tank some, you wore your AC kit.  If you knew you were just the damage output machine, you let AC go in favor of STR gear (granted, this was back when most people didn't routinely hit the caps LOL).<br />
<br />
It seems obvious that if you're soloing and taking hits, you should have the shield.  If you've got some big beefy tank sucking up the hits and damage in your group, every little bit of DPS is worth it.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps a better thing to point out would be that the above scenarios should be how the game is balanced.  If we aren't seeing a very large increase in DPS due to dual wield over buckler, it means that it needs to be tuned some more so that there is a compelling reason to give up that armor for weapons.  That's the kind of thing that needs be forwarded to the Devs so they can tune it better for release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">06-03-04, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was the most remarkable thing I noticed. Damage output didn't increase much, but the death quotient did and I've experienced that firsthand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malakie</div><div class="date">06-06-04, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He makes some good points, but I'm still against Bucklers the majority of the time.<br />
<br />
First off, if I'm in a group, I'm almost never tanking.  If I'm taking any damage, it's usually from spell casters which bucklers do nothing for.  I might take some damage if I'm Sap pulling, but not enough to justify any DPS hit by equipping a Buckler.<br />
<br />
Even soloing I'm not prone to using a buckler.  If it's a mob that runs, having snare in off-hand and Deadly on main is far superior, imo, than the tanking upgrade you get from using a buckler.  The only time I might consider it is if I'm fighting something that doesn't run.  <br />
<br />
One other thing you lose with a Buckler is the ability to efficiently snare/DoT kite.   Crippling + Deadly + Rupture can make higher level mobs much easier to take down solo, though it's not very efficient time-wise.<br />
<br />
I'm on the fence with Swords.  Backstab is starting to do some decent damage but the power usage is pretty high.  Howerver, as he pointed out, you can do some good damage by using sinister strike + sword.  I'm going to look for a good sword to do some testing with, but it's kind of hard to get any solid results without logging implemented yet.<br />
<br />
I almost never use Kidney Shot, especially since it only lasts for about half of the stated duration.  A 2.5 second stun for 5 combo points is far less desirable than an Eviscerate in most cases.  It is nice as an extra spell-stun if Kick and Gouge are unavailable, though.  I've not used Garrotte consistantly since I got Cheap Shot.  The DoT is far less useful than a 4 second stun + 2 Combo points.  I agree that Ambush is not very useful and seriously needs to be upgraded.  I never use it unless I'm just messing around and trying to score one large hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">06-06-04, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was grouped with another rogue today, she was using a Sword and a buckler and doing very good damage whilst staying alive.  I was dual wielding daggers and she commented, somewhat condescendingly, that i didn't look like i had touched swords yet.   Maybe they're worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lvydro</div><div class="date">06-14-04, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">swords are worth it, since the only two dagger only abilities (backstab and ambush) currently suck compared to what you could use in the same situation.<br />
<br />
backstab just isnt worth the energy, and ambush is the worst of the three stealth skills you can start a battle with (ambush, garrote, and cheapshot)</div></div><hr />
