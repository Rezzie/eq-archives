<br />
Here's a link to the recently released gameplay video for Lord of the Rings Online.<br />
<br />
LOTRO_Gameplay_Broll.wmv (ftp://ftp.fz.se/pub/mov/lotro_shadows_of_angmar/LOTRO_Gameplay_Broll.wmv) (174 megabytes)<br />
<br />
Everything about the game looks very WoWish except the fighting animations.  The fighting animations remind me of DAoC and that is SO not a good thing.  I don't understand that swing....stand..stand..stand...swing...stand..stan d..stand battle animation in some games.  Who thinks that looks good?  Why can't people just make the fighting animations like EQ.  Original EQ's fighting animations were the best I've seen in any MMORPG.  (No, please don't bring up Luclin models.. that's not Original EQ)<br />
<br />
Other than that, it looks pretty entertaining.<br />
<br />
By the way, the pictures aren't that sharp because they were taken as screenshots from the video.  The video is kind of washed out and fuzzy due to it being captured with FRAPs most likely.  (And it's WMV format.. /hork)<br />
<br />
If you'd rather view the pictures in Picasa Web Albums so you can view them as a slideshow you can go here: Lord of the Rings Online Pics (http://picasaweb.google.com/ChromitesPics/LordOfTheRingsOnlinePics)</div></div><hr />

Which, sadly, is more than enough to turn me away from it.<br />

None were very creative.  I think this game will end up like D&amp;DO.  A lot of people will try it out, but after a couple of months the population will see a rapid decline.<br />
<br />
Despite of what you think of WOW, that game had artistic merit.  Turbine has yet to create anything that could be considered artistic or well thought out in terms of game direction.</div></div><hr />

Wait Wait, did you actually claim that EQ original fighting system was better then DAOC fighting system?<br />
<br />
lol<br />
<br />
EQ was Swing Swing period.. Back Stab was pretty much the only thing you could consider a style and it didn't have a unique animation..<br />
<br />
DAOC styles atleast were different</div></div><hr />
