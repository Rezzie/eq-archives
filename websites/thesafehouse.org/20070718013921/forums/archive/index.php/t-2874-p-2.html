<br />
*megaphone crackle*<br />
<br />
&quot;You there...in the speeding thread...PULL OVER!  NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Six simultaneous sighs later, the thread pulls over.<br />
<br />
Shadowcross:  &quot;Yes, officer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Kezzek: &quot;Good morning, folks.  You seem in a bit of a hurry.  Did you realize that hi-jacking threads is against the law?  Plus, you're all committing the most heinous crime of all...Artificial Post Count Inflation! *cue dramatic music bit*  You're going to leave me no choice but to punish you in a manner to fit the crime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shadowcross: &quot;But, Officer Kezzek, we're onl--&quot;<br />
<br />
Halen: (leaning out the rear car window, in a skreechy falsetto) &quot;OSSIFER, CARE FOR SOME TEEEEA!?!!?&quot;<br />
<br />
*Kirrae and Jhani grab Halen and pull him back into the back seat, giggling.*<br />
<br />
Shadowcross: &quot;Uh, sorry about that, Officer.  He just got a new hat and is feeling a bit giddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Kezzek: (eyeballing Halen with Jhani and Kirrae's hands clamped over his mouth)  &quot;Have I seen you somewhere before?....I think I have....in some OTHER hi-jacked thread, I believe.  Yesss, I think I have...&quot;<br />
<br />
*Officer Kezzek begins to scribble on a ticket pad*<br />
<br />
Peebs: (from the passenger's seat, muttering)  &quot;Aww, man...you pigs are always messin' with me.  As if my arrest photo isn't bad enough...&quot;<br />
<br />
*Officer Kezzek stifles a chuckle and continues to write up a ticket.*<br />
<br />
*Recursion leans over from his spot straddling the stick shift.*<br />
<br />
Recursion: (spotting the OS of the ticket pad, scornfully)  &quot;OH. MY. GAWD.  You're using TicketScratch 98!?!?  *gags*  Anyone who's ANYone uses WriteUX!!  L00Z3R!!&quot;<br />
<br />
*Officer Kezzek grins at Recursion and then his ticketpad promptly crashes.  Kezzek scowls.*<br />
<br />
*Recursion does a Nelson &quot;HA-HA!&quot;*<br />
<br />
Officer Kezzek:  &quot;Well, I guess I'm gonna have to let you go this time.  But, don't let it happen again.  Artificial Post Count Inflation is only funny until someone puts an eye out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Halen: (escaping from his gag)  &quot;Did someone need a one-eye?...&quot;  *begins to lift his kilt*<br />
<br />
All Others in Unison:  *SCREAM*<br />

Ooo, Shadowcross had an exciting weekend!  I played EQ hardcore this weekend in preperation for my first plane raid (yay!).  We explored the crypt in Sebilis (and got some amazing things), killed Trakanasaurus Rex, busted our way through Kedge Keep (I got the finishing blow on Phinny, woop!), and busted some fire giants up!<br />

You owe me a plat for that Druid, either that or give me a couple shots of that whisky   <br />

Hmmm, maybe we can get a necro in for the cleaning.  He can summon a pet and do it in half the time, as long as it doesn't get lost.<br />

As for those drawings, would've done it last night if the damn server had been up.<br />

Shadowcross, Recursion, and Kirrae stop their little chat in the corner of the room to try and find the source of this sound. Tibis opens an eye, nearly awakened from his nap on the floor. Even Peebs stops his frenzied muffin-slinging and looks around him in confusion. Eventually, their eyes focus on a diminutive figure emerging slowly from behind an upturned table, where he had hid for a moment of peace. Daklin checks the power output monitor, notices it is at an acceptably high level, winks at Kirrae, and flicks the switch on his toaster. A rapid-fire barrage of smore pop tarts launches from the business end of the oven, all heading for a figure long forgotten - the lone Dr00d, who had camouflaged in his position near the door. He looks up in fear, and a moment later the Dr00d is flying backwards out the door, a mass of crumbs and sticky chocolate and marshmallow goo.</div></div><hr />

he wafts lightly into the room, to reveal the huge Barbarian holding him up by the collar.<br />
<br />
'I believe THIS is one of yours.' says the Barbarian, promptly dropping Malvan onto the floor with a look of distaste. <br />
<br />
The Barbarian takes a look around the room, before wheeling around and marching out of the door.<br />
<br />
'When Tibis awakens, tell him that I still want those drawings done' he says as he marches off into the sunrise.<br />
<br />
Malvan staggers to his feet, and makes a beeline for the table in the corner. Pulling out a bottle he takes a deep swig and looks 100% better.<br />
<br />
'Ahhhh. I needed that. I made it halfway to Kerra before I hit the water!'<br />

He looks down at his slightly smoking pants.<br />

I'm in too good a mood to be grumpy myself, had a good night on EQ, long conversation with Jete too!    <br />
<br />
I also got a random tell from some chap asking me where my name came from, so I explain it's from an AD&amp;amp;D character of mine from way back (at least 9 / 10 years).  He then proceeded to explain that Tibis is the nickname / contraction for real name all his friends call him in real life!  He's searched around and found like 3 other people who use that name in any context.<br />
<br />

Oh yes, I also had a cool conversation with a 51 Rake (can't remember the guys name though, I think I've got a screenshot at home).  Look forward to meeting him again some time   <br />

It was kinda fun to camp some stuff and wander about, XP was OK, and getting 14 Whore's Bane leaves was good, but the experience left a slightly bitter taste in my mouth about just how much the 'Me Me Me! Now Now Now!' attitude takes over at times like this.<br />
<br />
I'll stop going on about this, there are half a dozen other threads on the Safehouse where this is hot gossip.<br />
<br />
I forgot something else cool happened to me over the weekend!  I was in the Freeport bank thinking I really need to ditch some stuff (what the hell  is Scrounge's Pelt for anyway?) when I got the message someone is interested in a trade.  So I click out of the bank and turn around to see a gnomish caster of some description.  A few moments a trade window opens with what looks like 10 throwing daggers in there and the green light to take them.  I think 'Cool, I'm out of throwing weapons' and thank the guy politely for them, not checking them.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, out of mistimed curiosity I click them again - and find it's 10 THROWING BOULDERS!!  Yay!!  Kinda heavy (25.4 for a stack of up to 20) but you can't resist that huge damage and range!  I /tell the guy, thanking him more profusely this time<br />
<br />
I've banked them in case of a guild raid that I can go on, and in the hope I can get more (a full stack of 20 would be cool), 2 stacks would be a bit heavy though.  I really ought to get my throwing skill out from the pit of doom it's in at the moment (although I'm saving up training points to dump 15 or so into Riposte at 30th) so I don't miss as often as I currently do (it would be a shame to waste them).<br />

<br />
Glad you are in a good mood today Kirrae, and congratulations on your wedding.<br />
<br />
This week is gonna be super slow for me.  After going to hate on saturday I am eager to go back next saturday and kick some more planar butt yet again.  I'm going to have to get some hardcore exp this week because I am lagging way behind the rest of my guild.  <br />

Oh and Tibis, I'll see what I can cook up.<br />

 Daklin hands Tibis a small, quickly made metal ball.<br />

And to the campers as well.<br />

I had a bit of good news myself this weekend.  I purchased my  first piece of Ravenscale (yes I posted and made a temporary sig to show it up).  I also got some nice poisions and a new weapon so I'm feeling like a proper rogue now rather than a ragtag from PvP one item loot days.<br />
<br />
Shadowcross, days off from work are to be cherished.  I hope you have  a nice relaxing one.</div></div><hr />

Wow Fricka, I am truly jealous.  I camped those arms for over 12 hours (in total) and only ever saw the archon once.  I still would buy some if I saw some in auction (at a reasonable price of course).<br />
<br />
Good show!  <br />
