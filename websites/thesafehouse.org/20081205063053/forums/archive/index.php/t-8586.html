<br />
I take it getting the Box back is not normal, and some poor mofo gave him a box and not his ring, or got agro or something, dunno.<br />
<br />
Just want to confirm getting box back is not normal.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make sure faction is Dubious or better, by the time you are at 9th, it should be.<br />
<br />
Also make sure that you are giving box and ring to him.<br />
<br />
If Dain still does not take the box, make sure that you have hit combine and then try again.  If it still dont work...<br />
<br />
I would petition as quest bug.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
You could now use it to MQ with someone on eighth to get them their 9th.<br />
<br />
I'd avoid doing so tho because it'd be considered exploiting a bug and it's not like ring 9 is hard to do once you have someone that can make the poison.</div></div><hr />
