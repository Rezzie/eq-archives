<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AdminLadyLuck</div><div class="date">02-17-02, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just as you entered the new node your friend had told you to visit, your vision turns pitch-black and you are surrended by darkness. Just as quick as the darkness came up a new icon can be seen a short distance ahead of you - the familiar icon of a Shadowland-affiliated BBS. It slowly fades away while your surroundings start to change... you are standing in a dark alley, infront of a regular looking house. Looking up to the sky you notice that it's night, with a full moon shining over your head, its light illuminating the alley. It is totally quite here, it seems as if you were the only person around - but still.. something is strange. Your scans didn't show up anything, but still you can't shrug off the feeling of being watched. After a few moments you focus your concentration on the house again. It's a rather large building, 5 stories tall and at least half a block long. Behind some of the windows there are lights to be seen, but most of them are dark. The only entrance seems to be a large steel door in the middle of the frontside.<br />
You move towards the door, only now noticing the small slot in it. As you approach, the slots opens and two mean looking eyes start at you. They seem to be looking deep into you, taking you apart and scanning every megapulse of your persona. After a few seconds a harsh looking voice says:<br />
<br />
  Okay, come in.<br />
<br />
  The door slowly swings open and a dimly lightened corridor can be seen. You enter the building and the door closes behind you - the person that opened it for you is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly a new icon appears infront of you, about one yard away from your head. It is a burning red lamda about 2 feet large. At the same time you hear a voice speaking from somewhere behind the lamda.<br />
<br />
  Welcome to the newly re-opened Safehouse BBS node here in the Matrix! <br />
<br />
  The lamba starts morphing into a humanoid body, flowing into the new shape like quicksilver. A few moments later a slender woman is standing infront of you. Although she is wearing modern clothes - a blue jeans and a rather tight-fitting shirt with a big smiley face on it - there is something wrong with her. Just a moment later you realise what is causing that impression: a large silver bow on her back, with a corresponding quiver hanging at her belt. Her long black hair is bound into a ponytail, her green eyes are carefully studying you.<br />
<br />
  My name is Lady Luck and I am one of the admins running this place. You might already know my cousin - His name is Shadowcross Bladesong. I hope you enjoy your stay. If you have got any questions, feel free to ask. <br />
<br />
  Lady Luck smiles at you, then leads you to the Main Hall of the building... Lady Luck  - Safehouse BBS AdminEdited by: AdminLadyLuck at: 2/17/02 8:11:44 am</div></div><hr />

 Lady Luck seems to be casting a spell of some kind - probably just her theme for executing a small program - and hands you both things.<br />
<br />
So, where are you operating from, Xaaron?<br />

It's an elf with a bluish-black skin and white hair. He is wearing some sort of dark brown-black combat armor that was somehow designed to look medivial. His weapons and the rest of his equipment seem to fit into that theme - he is weilding two mean looking daggers.<br />

 Just as Lady Luck spoke these words, half a dozen shadows in the room start to move and reshape themselves into some kind of panther or leopard. The are moving next to Lady Luck where they sit down, cautiously studying the two men standing in front of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Young man, might you go fetch me a Large tankard of Ale?&quot;<br />
<br />
 pauses a few moments and calls out louder<br />
<br />
&quot;Elf!  Im still waitin for me ale!&quot;<br />
<br />
 grumbles something to himself then gets up, heads towards the bar in search of some ale.  As he passes you, you hear<br />
<br />
&quot;Never can find good service in inn's now adays...&quot;<br />
<br />
 gets a gold coin out of his pouch, flips it to the bartender.  After guzzling down the Ale, he wipes his beard with his sleeve, belches loudly, and declares,<br />

<br />
So friends, how are your decks handling the scupltured system in here? Do you like the reality filter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brelkor</div><div class="date">02-18-02, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A particularly mean looking and ugly dwarf with a large bristling black beard stumbles in through the door.  He has a large waterskin clutched in one hand but from the reek of spirits the skin is definitly not full of water.  The dwarf walks a few wobly steps into the tap room looking about with bloodshot and bleary lookin eyes.  He takes a swallow from the skin and notices its empty.  He tosses it into the corner without a thought and starts to speak in a rough, slurred tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;which ones of yous gonna bru bring me sum spiritssess?&quot;<br />
<br />
The dwarf takes a look around the room, eyes unable to focus on anyone in particular.  He suddenly stares at his blood encrusted hand which he was waving about at the inn's patrons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bloody orcs.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dwarf seems to smile an ugly smile before collapsing to the ground.  Several silvery coins roll across the floor unnoticed by the dwarf, who begins to eminate rumbling snores.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 LadyLuck actives a few icons and disconnectes the sleeping dwarf from the host. His persona starts to dissolve as he is dumped to his deck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elerion</div><div class="date">02-18-02, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rapidly growing crowd soon grows silent as the most beautiful tunes come floating in from outside the house. The effect of the music is slowly starting to wear off when a handsome young elf in dark clothes and a fiery red cape steps through the door. He's holding a lute with intricate carvings, and his eyes tell a thousand tales. He looks like a character in a poor medieval movie flick, but that illusion is soon dispelled as the two ivory-colored pistols under his cape become visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings friends, my name is Elerion, travelling musician, storyteller and trickster. Of the old school, of course. I don't care much for these modern instruments. Perhaps you would care to introduce yourselves before I continue my tales of heroes of times past.&quot;<br />
<br />
 The elf glances over at the slender lady with the long black hair and the mesmerizing green eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;And that goes for you especially, ma'am. I never leave a pretty lady without getting to know her name ... and perhaps her preferred choice in underwear&quot;<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
OOC: Perhaps the setting should be more defined, to make sure things fit in with the story. Normally I wouldn't bring an elf into a science fiction campaign, but since the setting seems to be a future version of Norrath/Middle-Earth/Forgotten Realms considering the Dark Elf and Dwarves, a true elf can't hurt.<br />
<br />
If I just completely misunderstood everything, feel free to ignore me. Edited by: Elerion at: 2/18/02 4:38:16 pm</div></div><hr />

The dwarf stands up, somewhat steadier than before and looks about, a grim look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smells too much like elves.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dwarf searches about his person, reaching into a miriad collection of dirks, daggers, and other weapons.  He fails to find whatever he was searching for and then spies the bar with his eyes.  He acts like he is moving forward, pauses, and turns and walks out of the door. Edited by: Brelkor at: 2/18/02 6:30:31 pm</div></div><hr />

At least thats what he told himself.  Stepping into the little nook that for him held a sliver of home, he coughed at the sudden change of atmospheres. His condition did not lend well to changes. Leaning heavily on what appeared to be a shiny steel walking cane topped with a golden boar, he kept much of his face hidden in the shadow, limping over to where he would be little cared for and less seen.  <br />
    The usual barmaid Ginger came over as she often did, to silence the cough that he didnt realize had become quite audible. Bringing an empty old cup, and another half filled with hot water, she set them with an herbal pouch on the small sitting table by his chair. Still she didnt look directly at him, though the smile she cast was a good effort at restraining pity. Walking away she cleared a few of the game pieces. Normally the table was reserved for a game the locals liked to call king's folly. How ironic. <br />
    &quot;My folly. My folly&quot;<br />
Had he gone mad?<br />
    Looking briefly up he realized he had been rocking almost in a sitting fetal position. Alot of things didnt make sense like they used to. <br />
     He was not old, not by most peoples standards. His muscles seemed to have a sort rigid strength coming from lifting the sword and breaking the stone. Half of his face and most of his body was in fact well figured. Nonetheless he looked as if he had seen hell, and Asmodean himself ripped out the eye, and torn the flesh off half his visage, though he hid it well under the folds of his hood. <br />
Perhaps Asmodean did.<br />
     Chortling to himself, his face seemed colder than usual, and carefully touching it he realized another piece of skin had fallen. Fluid was eeking from his face, a sicky morass of thinned blood and busted scabs. Reaching inside his cloak pocket he gathered his wraps, and bandaged the hairless half of his head to his chin, making half his head a mass of bandages. It itched. It burned. Pressing his hand hard up against the bandages he scratched through the appendage. Getting a bit of respite from that he poured the herbs into the hot water, and made more of an effort to size up who was frequenting the establishment with what eye he had left.<br />
     Spitting into the empty cup, he wiped the some of the drool off his chin and made an effort at composing himself. <br />
     Who were these fools? These people that pretended to wear the sting of battle like a badge. He doubt any had even noticed that he entered. This was after all a mercenary bar. And the last thing anyone in this place wanted to know was what they could become....if they failed. <br />
