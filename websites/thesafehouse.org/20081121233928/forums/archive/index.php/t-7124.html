<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Raedar</div><div class="date">11-27-02, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was duo hunting with a druid last night on the top floor, just down past the door that leads to the genie guy. We were killing the three tormented wraiths that spawn in one of the cells. At one point, I killed a wraith and a body looking like a dead wraith spawned on the floor. It was an &quot;exiled officer of marr&quot;. Conned indifferent, was blue at 57, could not be attacked or cast upon, didn't respond to hails, but would accept items. I have to assume it is for a quest, but I have no idea which quest or what to give it. I've seen symbol of marr or talisman of marr on vendors in PoT, so I may buy one and try giving that to him if I can get him to spawn again. Only spawned once while we were there.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any info on this guy? <br />

<br />
There are 3 mobs that spawn the exiled officers in PoJ and you hand a box of souls to each one to get a soul from them. Then you hand in the 3 souls to Grenic in PoV.</div></div><hr />
