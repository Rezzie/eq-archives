<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Far Sky</div><div class="date">11-06-05, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 favorite anime?<br />
<br />
1 - Cowboy Bebop<br />
2 - Cowboy Bebop<br />
<br />
Ok, fine...for the second one, I'll take Princess Mononoke if you're looking for a film, Fullmetal Alchemist if you're looking for a series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PsiKoTicK</div><div class="date">11-06-05, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FMA &gt; Cowboy Bebop<br />
<br />
I found Cowboy Bebop to be EXCELLENT animation and the voice acting was actually better here than in Japan.  But the story isn't that great, particularly in comparison to FMA, which arguably is one of the best anime series of all time.  Cowboy Bebop is good, but it's not &quot;the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
I personally enjoy sillier stuff more often.  I enjoyed Chrno Crusade more for the comedy than the seriousness, which I think is why I dislike the ending so very much.  I like Slayers, and goofy shows.  Except FLCL, which I find pointless.  Meh, there has to be a POINT to the silliness.<br />
<br />
Anyway, opinions are like...  well, everyone has one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's tough to do off-hand. Let's see... just the stuff I can come up with right this second.<br />
<br />
Shoujo - (Anime for Young Girls) Kodocha<br />
Shoujo-ai - (can't really think of something off-hand, but it's lesiban relationship without decipting sex)<br />
Mahou Shoujo - (Magical Girls) Cardcaptor Sakura, Pretty Cure, etc<br />
Yuri - (lesiban love, decipting sex) *insert randon ero title*<br />
Shounen (Anime for Young Boys) Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, Death Note, etc.<br />
Shounen-ai (Boy Love without sex) - Meine Liebe, can't really think of more.<br />
Yaoi - (Gay sex) *insert random ero title*<br />
Seinen (Adult Male title) Berserk, Monster, etc<br />
Jousei - (Adult Femaile) Honey and Clover<br />
<br />
That's all I could think of off-hand, I could list some more later on, probably.<br />
<br />
My #1 favorite title is easy, One Piece. However, my 2nd favorite title would be nearly impossible to deciede. Do I go with a classic, Macross SDF? My beloved Urusei Yatsura? Or more modern moe, like Ichigo Mashimaro or Rozen Maiden? Kodocha? Galaxy Express 999? I'm just so overwhelmed I cannot possibly deciede, heh.</div></div><hr />

#1 is Adult Male/Young Girl, and #2 is Young Male / Adult women? You're a peculiar one! :D<br />
<br />
I'd have to say, for genre, #1 is moe (i didn't list it up above because I'm pretty sure it's not a official genre, and it's much too hard a subgenre for me to try to explain how it would work) and #2 is Seinen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh...I just find some of the Adult women ones a bit too serious at times....More for the Monster/.hack///Gunslinger girl type then prob the next type is romance like Ai Yori Aoshi(this is young right? might be adult but did not think so..), Ah! My Goddess, Love hina etc...<br />
<br />
Then for #2 its like Bleach,Naruto etc....Can't think of one for Adult women yet lol....<br />
<br />
Not sure if I did the types right but something like that :P....</div></div><hr />

Wow that is weird hehe....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't think Ai Yori Aoshi was very 'harem'...sure it may have had some but overall was pretty neutral or at lest not extreme as others....<br />
<br />
I guess this is why subgenre's exist heh....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">11-06-05, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My 2 fav genres would be<br />
<br />

<br />
No that I don't watch others, these are just top favorites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">11-07-05, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets see,   Probably Shoujo or Seinen titles, most of my collection seems to be made up of them.  (Not only Berserk but also Ai Yori Aoshi types on the one side, Lots of cutsey titles on the other)  Seem to have a lot of the 'Romantic Types' and 'Depressing Types' of the pair in my catalog.<br />
But I do like Jousei and Mahou Shoujo almost as much.<br />
<br />
On a side note, Hentai just HAS to me mentioned. :b<br />
<br />
As far as top favorate Anime specificlly... Thats hard to define.<br />
Tenchi Muyo and Dominion Tank Police were the two series that got me into anime so I should at least mention them.  (Ryoko with Ryo-Ohki is still my favorate anime character, I was pissed when I found out they changed seiyuu in the new series :angry)<br />
Fujishima Kosuke made some good ones that I tend to keep an eye out for new stuff (AA! Megami Sama, You're Under Arrest!, eX-Driver, Piano)<br />
I like Rumiko Takahashi's stuff for mindless fun. (Maison Ikkoku, Urusei Yatsura, Mermaid Forest, Ranma 1/2)</div></div><hr />

Tenchi Muyo...hehe i remeber when they used to show that with sailor moon on CN YEARS ago :P. Its too bad tho, Tenchi Muyo was kinda nice hehe.<br />
<br />
Hehe if i had to pick a classic anime fav it would prob be Lupin III :P...</div></div><hr />
