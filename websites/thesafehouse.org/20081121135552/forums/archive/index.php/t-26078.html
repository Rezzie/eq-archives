I would like every body to know that we are in open recruitment for the upcoming MMO Vanguard: Saga of Hero’s.  We are a tight nit guild looking to progress through the game, while still enjoying it for every thing its worth.  We are focused on adventuring, but also have an entire section devoted to crafting and diplomacy.  Please come check us out at www.thebsd.net.  <br />
<br />
     You can check out the forums and the web site and see if you are interested.  We do want to progress, so we will be playing 10 hours a week at the least, if that doesn’t sound like your play style then now worries, I’m sure there are other guilds out there for you.<br />
<br />
Thank you for letting me have this time with you, and happy hunting :D.<br />
