 Compiled by Zato  <br />

 Many Rogues had input on this list to inform other classes how to group with a Rogue effectively.  These are obviously just the basics, but I think every Rogue would agree.   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
 1.  The Rogue will position himself behind the target for backstabbing.  Once the fight has begun, avoid moving around as this makes it much harder for Rogue to keep in backstab position.  All group members should stay on the same side of the target so Rogue can maneuver behind.  <br />
   <br />
 2.  Pull targets away from walls/doors/lava so that the Rogue can manuever behind it.  <br />
   <br />
 3.  Keep in mind Rogues have about the same HP as a Shaman.  <br />
   <br />
 4.  Taunt as much as possible to keep target off the Rogue (see #3).  <br />
   <br />
 5.  You don't have to remind the Rogue to use backstab, if you don't see them doing it it's because the backstab keeps missing or the mob turns on them just before they attempt it.  <br />
   <br />
 6.  Poisons are too expensive/time consuming to be used except in the most rare occasions.  Even if attempted it is a one-time random effect.  <br />
   <br />
 7.  Rogues CAN now walk invis, but it is VERY slow (Imagine walking with half bar of health).  <br />
   <br />
 8.  If you're a druid, cleric, caster, etc... and something is beating you down, DON'T RUN AROUND! Makes it much harder for the rogue to backstab (taunt) it off you.  <br />
   <br />
 9.  Rogues shouldn't be pullers if there are tanks in a group. If a rogue pulls makes it much harder to have things taunted off him.  <br />
   <br />
 10. If a mob runs let the rogue have room to backstab, don't need the whole group chasing or wasting mana on it (unless its for snare or root).  <br />

 What the tanks should know:   <br />
    <br />
 If there is a rogue in your group your primary function in life is to Taunt.  Taunt hard, taunt long, and then when it's all over taunt some more.  Do whatever you can to get that mob to face you.  A rogue with a mob facing him is operating at about 70% effectiveness.  And for hybrids taunting isn't just limited to the taunt button.   <br />
    <br />
 If your a Paladin: blind, stun and heal thoughout the battle.   <br />
 If your a Shadow Knight: dot, dark, and drain.   <br />
 If your a Ranger: Snare, Root and Bomb   <br />
    <br />
 Even if it doesn't land you get the full taunt effect of that spell.   <br />
    <br />
 If a mob runs let the rogue have room to backstab, don't need the whole group chasing or wasting mana on it (unless its for snare or root).  This holds especially true for large races, we can't run though you.   <br />
    <br />
 Pull targets away from walls/doors/lava so that the Rogue can manuever behind it. There is 90 degree angle behind the mob where backstab works.   <br />
  <br />
    <br />
 What the casters should know:   <br />
    <br />
 Hold out as long as you can before dropping that bomb or throwing that heal.  A rogue may not be the greatest tank but he can take more damage than you.  If the battle is going well then wait until the mob is at half.  If it's not try stuns and roots.     <br />
    <br />
 With his sheer ablility to taunt a rogue can be a casters best friend.  In the unfortunate event that you do get a mob on you DON'T RUN AROUND.  Give the rogue a chance to take a few swings on it then back away a short distance.  If the mob follows stop and try again.   <br />
    <br />
 During downtime, DO NOT CAST ON A ROGUE unless you can see him and he is not invisable.    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
 What everyone should know:   <br />
    <br />
 The Rogue will position himself behind the target for backstabbing. Once the fight has begun, avoid moving around as this makes it much harder for Rogue to keep in backstab position. All group members should stay on the same side of the target so Rogue can maneuver behind.    <br />
    <br />
 The bane of a rogue is the NPC caster.  We rarely interuppt their spells.  A high green caster can end our lives in no time.  Bash, Slam, Stun or Nuke just keep that thing from casting.   <br />
    <br />
 In most zones rogues are the best corpse recovery class in the game: kedge, lower guk and solb being the exceptions.  Hide/sneak never wears off but Mobs that see invisable and undead can however see a hide/sneaking rogue.  Even so their aggro range is smaller because of sneak.   <br />
    <br />
  <br />
 What a rogue should know   <br />
    <br />
 Learn to circle strafe.  Practice it until you can do it with as few 'you can't see your target' messages as possible.   <br />
    <br />
 Know the spell effect for stun (red dots) and when you see it circle around, backstab and return to your position.   <br />
    <br />
 When a NPC mob begins casting circle around and backstab and return to your position.   <br />
    <br />
 If there is a chance in hell that that mob is going to turn it's back on you save that backstab, if not use it as an extra pierce.   <br />
    <br />
 Nobody taunts off you like another rogue, the most effective groups I'm in feature two rogues oppisite each other or three rogues in a triangle.   <br />
    <br />
 You are a group only class, on the rare occasions you can solo you are not nearly as effective as you could be at that moment in a group.   <br />
   <br />
 Always be aware of what's happening to the casters.  If they can't cast your most likely to die.  Make sure that they are always opposite you and if a mob breaks off unto them it's your job to get it off.</div></div><hr />
