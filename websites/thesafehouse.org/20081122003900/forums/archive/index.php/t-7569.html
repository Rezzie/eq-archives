With the new server what do all of you who will be playing on it think about putting the ablitiy for rogues to pick pocket, and enchanters to charm back in the game.  I personally think pick pocket would be great on this server, and a good enchanter friend of mine told me the reason charm was taken out of pvp was to keep people from causing exp deaths.  Now that exp deaths are gonna happen what's your opinion?  BTW try and not turn this into a rant about confirmed rules and how unfair they are...thats why Safehouse has a rant hall.<br />

Charm - ..yes and no.  It would be fun, but exploited. 											Cylant Butdeadly<br />

<br />
The exploiting issues are moot, on a server where xp loss is a legitimate byproduct of PvP.  Charm can be used to make your corpse hard to recover, but I don't think there is anyplace where its impossible?<br />
<br />
Sure would add a bit of fun value.<br />

<br />
As for pick pocket, I think it should go in as +/-5 levels, and it makes the chinkling sound like when you buy/sell somthing (the victim hears it, or maybe only if unsuccesful).<br />

<br />
Level limit is unnecessary, cause if your mark is higher, he can toast you, if lower, well you could toast him and take his coppers anyways.<br />

Sure they can kill you, but your corpse would still have the cash heh.  Well...I am a long time lurker, new poster so let me ask some of you older folk. How do we let the Dev team working on the new server know our feelings about these skills?  Go to official message board, petition, what next?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Peyth</div><div class="date">05-24-01, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can kill anybody whether +/- 5 levels or not. However, you can't loot people out of that range.  So, on that same note, you should not be able to pickpocket people outside of the +/- 5 level range.  In the end tho, I doubt they'll have pvp pickpocket in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zoggynog</div><div class="date">05-24-01, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats why im askin how we attempt to get Pickpocket, charm, and fear back in.  I know it wont be in unless people ask for it, and ive seen the Safehouse community do amazing things through these message boards.  Thus, I am asking what is the best route to take in order to at least see how the devs feel about this possiblity.  Ive heard Kendrik (sp) is an insider at VI, any chance he could help?  Im hoping someone may have a suggestion on how to accomplish this goal.<br />
