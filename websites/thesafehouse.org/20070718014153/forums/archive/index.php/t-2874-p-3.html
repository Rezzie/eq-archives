 Daklin hits the Red Button. Everyone inside of the room lets out a collective gasp... but nothing is happening. Suddenly, Tibis notices his pants growing quite warm. He lets out a yelp, puts his hand in his pocket, and pulls out that odd metal ball. A jet of blue flame erupts from the bottom of it, and Tibis starts screaming as he flies up, creating a hole in the roof, and keeps on soaring.<br />
<br />
Everyone takes their eyes off of Tibis, and notices the coffee machine rumbling. Daklin grins, grabs onto the handles on the machine, and lets out a whoop as he is propelled into the air from the force of the coffee being fired out of the bottom of the device.<br />
<br />
<br />
He sails down to earth sometime later, extremely pleased with himself. The occupants of the room, however, do not quite share his view of the events - the whole room was flooded with coffee.</div></div><hr />

 Malvan stands up, raising a finger to wag at Shadowcross as he speaks. As he steps forward a hurtling, black clad form plummets through the hole in the roof, rebounds from his inflatable chair and flies out of the window making a noise something like Wheeeee-&amp;lt;boooiiing&gt;Urrrghah-waaarrrrgh&amp;lt;crash-tinkle-tinkle&gt;!<br />
<br />
Malvan stops, finger held up comically as he contemplates this strange vision. Shaking his head he retieves his finger from gesticular limbo and sits down again, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
'Naaah. Couldn't have been....'<br />
<br />

Partly to comfort his scorched companion, but mostly to get closer to Kirrae and Jete as they dote on the wounded Gninja.<br />
<br />
 Throws the ladies a quick wink, as he launches into full narrative mode - complete with dramatic, misplaced pauses, and expansive hand gestures<br />
<br />
A few hours af'er the raid was scheduled ta begin on Nasty Naggy, I thought I'd check in with my pal Peebs here...<br />
<br />
 Pats Peebs on the back, then wipes his now ash-covered hand on the pillow next to Peebs' head<br />
<br />
Lo an' behold, but the famous Gnomish Gninja was far from the brawl when I located 'im.... sittin' at the gates in West Freeport, lickin' 'is scars, nekkid as the day he was pushed from his muthah's womb.<br />
<br />
 Places the back of his hand to his forehead, very melodramatically<br />
<br />
&quot;Say it ain't so, Peebs!&quot; I cried.<br />
<br />
That's when he responded ta me wit' three simple words that left such a deep scorch mark in the tender surface of my Rogue-ish pride...<br />
<br />
&quot;He toasted us.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Places his face in his hands and weeps briefly<br />
<br />
 Then hops onto the table and begins to bow to his audience, removing his coif and proferring it to the audience<br />

I got to be there when Jete got her rapier and see it proc for the first time, on the killing blow against an Orc that objected to my presence no less.

<br />
Everyone makes major mistakes sometimes.  Mine was using 1HS almost exclusively until level 10, at which point I got a rude awakening about backstab.  It took me until level 13 or 14 for the retraining process to complete, and that was with decently fast stickers (~25).<br />
<br />
I know it's not in the same league of screw-ups as messing up half of a major quest, but the priciple's the same: complain and bitch about it for a while, then get back down to it with renewed determination.  Don't let it get you down and you'll come out of it a better rogue.<br />

And half of the smaller guilds on Bristlebane got wiped out doing Vox, mwahaha. Apparently on 1/2% of health, she gated back a few steps and complete healed. Doh. Raid scheduled to start at 8pm, mass CR at 4am, bed at 4.30am.... glad I wasn't there :-)<br />

I'm not even going to try to be pleasant, spent the evening in Blackburrow. I at least got my skins. Two brewers, no cask. I'll be back there again this evening.<br />
<br />
Edit: oh yea, found two people with a cask, 3k and 2k. I just laughed at them.<br />
<br />
Don't try to hug me Shadowcross,but Jhani and Kirrae can.    Edited by Colvin  at: 8/22/00 7:32:24 am</div></div><hr />

In between spawns I would run to e5 room or elite ledge and kill. e5 room is hardly camped anymore on Xegony.<br />
A necro was camping the brewer when I got online, he ended up buying one for 168pp.  He only had 2 brewers spawn in the 4 hrs he was there.  When he gave me the spawn, the first thing that popped was the brewer, but no luck though.  That would've been something.  I don't understand why the cask can't always be on the rare spawn?  A ranger needs 3 of those things.</div></div><hr />

Whassup Jhani, Kirrae?  Care to tell?<br />
<br />
I need to revamp the presentation on my little project, so it'll be a day or so yet.  Malvan's given me some good pointers, so I'm going to adjust it accordingly.<br />

Don't worry, everyone else will get an opportunity to criticise me soon  <br />

 Malvan gives Jhani a big, comforting hug. Carefully, considering the number of spiky objects they're both carrying.<br />

Jhani -- Do you like the Sims?  I was thinking of playing and have the game but am not sure I want to get it up and running.<br />
<br />
Colvin -- 2k and 3k!?!  Wow I'm glad I found a guy who didn't know what the cask was worth.  People started bidding on it for 4 cp and got up to 5 silver before I sent the warrior a /tell and offered 10 plat.  &quot;Sold,&quot; he said and I pounced on him before he could get away.<br />
<br />
Trudg -- You're leaving?  But you just got here (on this thread I mean).</div></div><hr />
