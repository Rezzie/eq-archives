<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korva</div><div class="date">03-11-07, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all. After playing a Shaman on a PVE server just about forever, I finally made the switch to a rogue on a PVP server (For the Horde!). Upon reaching <br />
L19, I gleefully made my way to Warsong Gulch, where I proceeded to Get Some. Unfortunately, the puny Alliance seems to have lots and lots of Hunters, and they keep ruining my day.<br />
<br />
Every time I attack one, I end up getting torn up from behind by the obligatory pet. They mark me, wing clip me, shoot me with concussive shot, and generally do all manner of unpleasant things to my poor, sneaky butt. I can hang with just about any other class, and I've even held my own against multiple rogues, but one hunter and his bear/lion/kitten is just too much. Even worse it is, when two hunters come after me. Remember, it's still low level (the 10-19 bracket), but I'd like to run the Gulch one more weekend. Anyone got some love for me?<br />
<br />
P.S.-Great Forum, glad to be here!</div></div><hr />
