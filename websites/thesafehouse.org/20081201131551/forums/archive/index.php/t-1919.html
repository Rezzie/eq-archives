<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrocat Moonstalker</div><div class="date">10-16-03, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far we've had 6 fire alarms this year. 5 of them were students pulling the alarm. 4 of them were in the last 3 days. The only week this year that we've had two tests in math class (6th period), and 3 of the 4 fire alarms this week were pulled 6th period. So not only are we screwed over on going over the study homework in class (that preps us for the tests), but there's no in-class reviews for the tests. And we have a huge test tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Adding on to our 6th periods personal loss, the fire department has wasted so much of their resources over the last 3 days that we had to have an emergency assembly today to tell those little pricks to KNOCK IT THE @#%$ OFF! <br />
<br />
We had a similar problem freshman year, not as bad as this but kids were still pulling the alarm monthy. We had an assembly where the head of the Seattle Fire Department came and explained how this steals their resources from people who actually need them, how it costs the city something like ~$1000 every time they have to come to the school, and how the next little punk who does it is going to be fined $700.<br />
<br />
The emergency assembly today once again had the head of the Seattle Fire Department. The principal gave his shpeal about how he still had confidence in the student body (chuckle), trusted us not to pull it again (uh huh) and hoped we could find the culprit (yeah right). The cheif guy came on and got really pissed off, ranting about resources and ended with saying whomever is caught will be persecuted, fined a large sum of money and put in jail. Maybe now these @#%$ will stop distrupting class and we can stop takeing half hour trips to the muddy, oft-rained-on football field and ruining my new pants!<br />

I believe that every day offers a 40% chance we will have a fire drill according to the statistics. Never bothers me though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaielen</div><div class="date">10-17-03, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There actually was a fire at my highschool once.  <br />
<br />
It took the kid trying to set off the alarm three tries before he found one that worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorla</div><div class="date">10-17-03, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our fire alarm pulls were always between 2 and 4 AM... god it sucked.  But on the other hand, it was funny to see people pile out of the rooms... it was an easy way to tell who was sleeping with who.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_joekreeper1</div><div class="date">10-17-03, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">our fire alarms shot out a UV dye when they were pulled... so they didn't get pulled much. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance --AbsorEQ&quot;<br />

<br />
We didn't get any unnecesary fire alarms</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Talius</div><div class="date">10-17-03, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had about 36 fire alarms all year in my dorm last year.<br />
<br />
Including four in one night, one time.<br />
<br />
Some were pulled by drunks. Most were caused by the fact that the dorm is really old. The temperature went down really low, the boiler heated up really high, and the alarm sensor near the boiler would go off.<br />
<br />
Three things that sucks:<br />
1) $300 from the fire department everytime there's a malfunction or pull that the dorm would have to split (thank god there were 800 residents in it)<br />
2) It was @#%$ freezing outside, and if you didn't go out on every single alarm and were caught inside, you got a hefty fine.<br />
3) The fire department leaves any fire they're at to come to our dorm because of the high population density. While it didn't happen to us, a few years back a child that was trapped in a fire in a house died because the department had to go to the dorm. The dorm's alarm had been pulled by a drunk kid that thought it would be funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sucks.. isn't there a way to force whoever owns and hasn't updated/fixed the building's system to pay the fines in events linked to the boiler? Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Talius</div><div class="date">10-17-03, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably. The thing is, that's basically just speculation. They said: &quot;Technical difficulties&quot;, and never admitted that it was something they could fix, which it most certaintly was</div></div><hr />
