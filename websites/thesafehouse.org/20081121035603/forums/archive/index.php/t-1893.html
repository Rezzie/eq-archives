<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">10-08-03, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tuesday I caught the sniffles coming home from classes. In a couple of hours, while enjoying SciFi's 10 hour hercules marathon, it developed into some sort of head cold/sinus infection that only infected one nostril and ear.<br />
<br />
Later on in the night, having not yet adjusted to our new home, I threw a hand up into the air in the den with great force. Directly into the light fixture on the fan.<br />
<br />
I am not used to having such low hanging ceiling fans. A horrible shattering sound played and I imagined my hand would be a lacerated chunk of flesh when I looked at it. There was a tiny, eraser sized bruise between two knuckles. I punched one of the four way light fixtures on the bottom of the fan, the force of which shifted it to the side 4 inches and shattered a lightbulb. Miraculously, I'm just bruised... when I probably should have been seriously injured.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if that falls under &amp;lt;3punch or bedsheets. I mean, it's a punch, but on an inanimate object.<br />
<br />
Lesson: Do not punch glass Sensei Pren{Dragon Army}[Tribunal Server]<br />
So I take shelter in tomorrow<br />
Tomorrow will bring a brand new day<br />
Think I can make it right tomorrow, <br />
Think I need more sleep today...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That way, I show that not only am I not sitting at a computer smoldering and asking for medical advice on the internet, but I am enlightening those foolish enough to do such things with worthwhile solutions.<br />
<br />
Or for some reason all those years I paid for GamePro magazines returned due to my net-withdrawls and the word ProTip reentered my vocabulary.</div></div><hr />
