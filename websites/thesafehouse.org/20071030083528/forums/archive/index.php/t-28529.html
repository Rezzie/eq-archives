The Chinese, for the record, have always treated me good at JFK.  It's those friggin' Irish that are the problem.  ;-)<br />
<br />
<br />
Have a great trip man!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">02-25-07, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jet Lag sucks. I don't even know what time zone my brain is in right now.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you are ever considering a trans-pacific flight, Just kip right over China Southern's selection of flights.<br />
<br />
15 hour flight.<br />
<br />
Had to board via bus, starting at 10:30 for a 11:50 flight out of LAX. (Of course, to my brain, that was 2:50 am, coming from EST.) So, we finally take off at 12:55. That's 4am by my brain. So, we settle in for a long sleep. Finally get cozy, and about the time the pilot takes the seat belt sign off, It's time for a meal! Yeah, That's exactly what I want at 4:30 in the morning. Anyway, we go from LAX to Guangzhou, and my last cigarette was at 9:30 Pacific time. We land, and have to wait in line for customs part 1. Repeat for customs parts 2 and 3. We barely make the connecting flight at Guangzhou, 4 families from our adoption agency were literally sprinting through the terminal to get there in time. So that's another 1 1/2 hrs, plus getting baggage, etc.<br />
<br />
At this point, I'm about to die for a cigarette, and I finally get outside. Light up, and the group's guide/translater says hurry, we are going to miss the bus!<br />
<br />
So, 1 single solitary puff on a cigarette, and back on the bus for another 50 minutes.<br />
<br />
I damn near couldn't walk after smoking that first one.<br />
<br />
It's 8 pm here, but it feels like 7 in the morning, with no sleep. Gonna crash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Xanax is about the only way I can make it through the flight, immigration then customs without killing myself or someone else near me until I can get a smoke down my throat.</div></div><hr />

As in, after a smoke he finds it much easier to deal with children. At least that would keep in line with what I've seen from my friend who smokes and deals with children.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">02-25-07, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I do plan to stop smoking. was going to before the trip, but my wife said to wait. She didn't want to have to put up with me in a bad mood at the same time she was putting up with weaning 2 babies from nursing. Can't say I blame her much either. :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and secondhand smoke is not a problem around kids. I'm stupid, but I'm not stupid enough to smoke near them</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is that? The amount of second hand smoke people are subject to decrease as peoples arent aloud to smoke in many places anymore but the increase in respiratory diseases increase in kids seem to increase every year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">02-25-07, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weirdest sight so far...<br />
<br />
Old Homeless guy with a full black beard and a Santa Claus Hat digging through Trash cans.<br />
<br />
Runner up? 2 men very professionally dressed walking along, who decide to use the bushes in front of a store as a urinal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">02-26-07, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We finally got Madelyn yesterday. Sweet as can be, and the quietist, calmest baby I've ever seen. If my others were only like that...<br />
<br />
Pics, videos, etc. at our Blog. http://aninvisiblethread.blogspot.com/ Some of the pics are fubared, because my wife's HTML-fu is weak, but you should be able to click on the links to galleries.<br />
<br />
Another bit of cross-cultural weirdness. A Fancy store with the name &quot;Chinese Caterpillar Fungus&quot;. It Had jars of stuff in the window, and I was afraid to ask if it really was Caterpillar fungus.<br />
<br />
It's like 70 degrees outside, feels really great, maybe a little bit brisk in the mornings. The Chinese think that us Americans are insane for going outside without coats on, and god forbid short sleeves. Every one of them is bundled up like I would be for 20 degree weather.<br />
<br />
The little old ladies will come up to us and make sure we have the kids dressed warm enough. Feel logan's hand and face and make sure they aren't too cold. And one couple who had their daughter dressed with some bare leg, I think they got cussed out in Chinese. Luckily, we had been warned in advance about the &quot;Clothing Police&quot; and had Madelyn dressed up snug and warm.</div></div><hr />
