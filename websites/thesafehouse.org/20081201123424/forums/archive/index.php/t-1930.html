<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh. My latest pair of headphones, $50 this time, have returned to the static crackling that my $14, $18, $24, $30, and $35 pairs did. No matter how careful I am, eventually the cord wraps itself around the arm of my chair, and yank. It only took one time for this pair to be horribly damaged. Adjusting the volume crackles, and for rock songs or other loud/intricate audio, it crackles.<br />
<br />
I feel like a dumbshit for buying a 'high quality' product when I should have just kept buying the cheap crap. Of course, you have to pay at least $20 to get one with an audio adjuster on the cord, it seems. Sensei Pren{Dragon Army}[Tribunal Server]<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's pretty much how I've killed the last few sets I've had too. Stand up and get up to leave and weeeee off fly the headphones thanks to getting tangled with the chair. Except this one set, and they don't even seem to make that design anymore so I'm quite glad it hasn't been destroyed yet.<br />
<br />
All the ones I find now are either dinky little things designed for walkmans with horrible sound quality, or huge monstrous things that are supposed to cover your ears completely. Which sounds a lot nicer than it really is after playing for a few hours when your ears are way too hot and itchy. Oh, I forgot the various insane designs where they're supposed to be designed around your ears and head structure - which is never as comfortable for long term use as plain old fashioned headphones. For someone who games like me there's one golden rule about headphones of any kind: If it bends around the ear or is supposed to be held up or in by the structure of the ear - it's a piece of sheit I'll end up tossing out after the first 12 hour game marathon.<br />
<br />
The only thing that's even remotely helped me was to start putting my drink on the side the headpones lead to. Had a few broken glasses to go with the broken headphones though. I don't bother buying the expensive headphones anymore tho, their life expectancy is too short. High quality seems to get yanked out of functioning just as easily as cheaper stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are monsterous head fitting things that cover your ears entirely, like you find in schools, or owned by musicians.<br />
<br />
However, they've still got the dinky as a freaking walkman headphones cord on them, instead of the industrial size cord used for amplifiers and musician headphones. Which they should, for $50 damnit.<br />

Also, dumbshit is cool because it gets through the filter. I -am- the Kevin Mitnik of profanity.</div></div><hr />

Prices look good as well.</div></div><hr />

That would hopefully solve the cord damage problems. I wonder if the extra weight adds to the discomfort, though?<br />

These are Altec Lansing, incidentally.</div></div><hr />

I picked up a pair of sony V6, based on recommendations from that site, for about $80 at Fry's and have been very happy with them.  Supposed to be very durable as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Phresh Prince</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">THESE are absolutely killer headphones - sure they're spendy, but I just found them at this link for a good deal.  They sound fux0ring amazing, have a heavy duty coiled cord - and I don't care what you think you know about full ear covering headphones - but these ar so cushy and padded they feel great.<br />
<br />
Did i mention their sound will blow you away?  They can deliver bass like you've never heard in a headphone before.  Back when I DJ'd on a regular basis these were my prized posession - now they're a little less prized because I don't use headphones so much (I have good speakers and don't have to be quiet. :P ) but I still would never go back to any other pair.</div></div><hr />
