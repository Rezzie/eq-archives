The two of my favorite so far have been the remains of the dead guy who asks you a question in chapter 2, and Tomi's story in chapter 3.  Except maybe he should have been a sorcerer's apprentice instead of a wizard's...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hummerlein</div><div class="date">07-22-02, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">tomi's stories are always hilarious.<br />
<br />
i also like the little stuff, like for instance, when i made a monk.  i didn't find any good armor for a while and didn't like the look of the newbie clothes so i was strutting around naked.  an amazing amount of people around town made comments about it, even ophala cracked a joke at my expense about it.<br />
<br />
also, you get a lot of weird reactions from npcs with low charisma (or get to make fun remarks with low int)<br />
<br />
trying to get luce in bed is nigh impossible with 6 charisma</div></div><hr />

I thought it was a great idea and I've started to incorporate it into my modules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know why, but a week later, find that funny  <br />
<br />
<br />
NWN henchmen are great. BG &amp;amp; BG2, they group members kept talking, it would get irritating at times!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was at a friends house and he was playing it before we hit our pnp game and I saw one of his party members was a Modron.<br />
<br />
Then I heard it say something like *Did you know I had 6 sides?*  I can't remember the other party members response but I found that hilarious.<br />
<br />
I laughed for days on end.  We'd call each other and out of the blue in a conversation we'd ask the other if they knew we had 2 feet, or 10 fingers and such.  OMFG we were out of our minds.<br />
<br />
I'm giggling now just thinking about it. hahaha!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Slyy Daugg</div><div class="date">07-30-02, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite funny line is in BG2 when the party is transported to Hell.  Each party member makes their own little comment (Ariel says something like, &quot;Oh!  Where are we?  I don't like this place!&quot;)  Basically every character says a foreboding remark, adding to the spirit of dread at having been transported to hell.  And then it gets to Edwin, and he says, &quot;Eh, I would have come here anyway, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stoped right there, walked out of the room and laughed my a$$ off.<br />
