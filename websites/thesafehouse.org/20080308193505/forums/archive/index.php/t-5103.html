<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cephlen</div><div class="date">06-15-02, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been leveling my shadowblade for many months in hopes of speccing him as a critblade.  Now that he is about to reach lvl 40 I must know exactly how I want my end spec to be.  The most important aspect I want reflected in my shadowblade is the ability to one shot.  I am willing to sacrifice left axe and a good amount of envenom points to achieve this.  This is the spec I am currently going for.<br />
<br />
Stealth  39<br />
Critical Strike 50<br />
Envenom 25<br />
Swords 41<br />
<br />
I am unsure exactly how much I should put into swords so that I would have a higher one shot rate but yet I do not want to deprive envenom too much.  Any advice and help will be greatly appreciated      (Bear in mind I want to maximize my ability to one shot)<br />
<br />
Also I was wondering how the reknowned shadowblade Bile was specced?<br />

Most people will never to get rr4 or 5, but more items will surely come out in the future and spellcrafting which should eliviate the burden of getting to rr5.<br />
<br />
Then you must have max weapon, which would be 50.  Gives you great damage varience.<br />
<br />
Then get critical strike as high as possible after that.<br />
<br />
I have been looking at 50 cs and 50 axe.  Thinkiing about dropping cs down to 39 since the last two styles are good damage but 3 and 4 in an evade chain.<br />
<br />
As you level, keep weapon max and cs right up there for the styles.  Toss 5 into envenom and let stealth auto-train until 24, which will give you 20 extra points, and just intime for the first battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Since you are already up there, get your weapon and CS high as possible, leading with sword (50 style is kewl), and dump rest into envenom and stealth evenly.</div></div><hr />
