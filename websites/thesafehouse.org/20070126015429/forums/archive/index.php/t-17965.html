<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lurker</div><div class="date">03-21-05, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it would seem after reading a lot of what everyone says here, and using my talents in the real world, that I need to re-spec my talents.  What I am aiming for (and have learned through play) is that I want to build completely for PvP.   I mostly want to use Stealth type pvp in that I want to come out of Stealth, hit as hard and fast as possible, kill my single target, then vanish.  I of course would like to be able to hang in mass battles, but that is not my focus.  My focus is primarily quick single kills.<br />
<br />
Here are the two things I'm thinking about, one is a kind of classic 30/8/13 and the other is a 21/8/21 leaving a point I truly don’t know what to do with.  Some things for me are simply un-negotiable and I’m going to leave as I have them now, but other things I'm just not sure how they work in the real world.  I would like any advice you can offer.  <br />
<br />
21/8/21 -- Please read my comments beside each talent.<br />
<br />
Assassination Talents (21 points)<br />
<br />
Improved Eviscerate - 3/3 points<br />
Increases the damage done by your Eviscerate ability by 15%. -- non-negotiable.  I want this.<br />
<br />
Malice - 5/5 points<br />
Increases your critical strike chance by 5%.  -- non-negotiable.   I want this so I am able to get Relentless Strike.<br />
<br />
Murder - 2/2 points<br />
Increases your chance to hit while using your Sap, Ambush, Garrote, or Cheap Shot abilities by 5%.  -- It's only 2 points, and its only 5%.  I'm not sure if this is worth it, but where else to spend?<br />
<br />
Ruthlessness - 3/3 points<br />
Gives your finishing moves a 60% chance to add a combo point to your target. -- I don't know if adding all these combo points is worth it or if I can simply get them done one at a time.  60% chance is pretty good though for only three points but it’s only on your finishing moves… ugh.<br />
<br />
Relentless Strikes - 1/1 point<br />
Your finishing moves have a 20% chance per combo point to restore 25 energy. -- This is kind of nice but 25 energy doesn't really make that much of a difference in PvP at level 60.  Does this go off often?  If it hit pretty often, then I could be adding 125+ points over a single fight, and that might be worth it.<br />
<br />
Lethality - 5/5 points<br />
Increases the critical strike damage bonus of your Sinister Strike, Gouge, Backstab, Ambush, Ghostly Strike, or Hemorrhage ability by 30%. -- Another non-negotiable.  It increases the damage by 30%, seems worth it.<br />
<br />
Improved Instant Poison - 1/5 point<br />
Increases the chance to apply Instant Poison to your target by 2%.  -- I needed a point to get up to cold blood, any suggestions where else to spend this point?<br />
<br />
Cold Blood - 1/1 point<br />
When activated, increases the critical strike chance of your next Sinister Strike, Backstab, Ambush, or Eviscerate by 100%. -- This seems worth it especially in this tree.  I can Cold Blood, Crit Evis, Preparation, build a few combo points, Cold Blood again and Crit Evis again.  Seems cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat Talents (8 points)<br />
<br />
Improved Gouge - 3/3 points<br />
Increases the effect duration of your Gouge ability by 1.5 seconds. -- Just need to get up to Improved Backstab.  I have it already and it doesn’t seem to really make that much of a difference but I’m not sure 3 points in Lightning Reflexes is worth it.<br />
<br />
Improved Sinister Strike - 2/2 points<br />
Reduces the Energy cost of your Sinister Strike ability by 5 Energy. -- Non-negotiable.  This makes a total difference, I already have it.<br />
<br />
Improved Backstab - 3/3 points<br />
Increases the critical strike chance of your Backstab ability by 30%.  -- I already have this and adding 10% per point seems like points well spent and I definitely land my backstab more often now with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Subtlety Talents (21 points)<br />
<br />
Master of Deception - 5/5 points<br />
Reduces the chance enemies have to detect you while in Stealth mode. More effective than Master of Deception (Rank 4) -- I don't want anyone to see me in Stealth Mode (otherwise what’s the point of this build), although these could be switched out for Camouflage.  I'm not sure which buys you more.  3 points in this talent and two in Camo maybe?  On this type of build I also have that one extra point so I could 3 in both?  Maybe take from elsewhere and get 5 in both?<br />
<br />
Opportunity - 5/5 points<br />
Increases the damage dealt when striking from behind with your Backstab, Garrote, or Ambush abilities by 20%. -- Increased Damage for Backstab and Ambush is awesome.  Definitely I will always have this one.<br />
<br />
Improved Ambush - 3/3 points<br />
Increases the critical strike chance of your Ambush ability by 40%. -- Another 40% chance of critical strike with my Ambush, this works really good and I will definitely keep it.<br />
<br />
Ghostly Strike - 1/1 point<br />
A strike that deals 125% weapon damage and increases your chance to dodge by 15% for 7 seconds. Awards 1 combo point. -- I needed to spend points to get up to Preparation.  I'm not sure if this buys me much of anything.  In a mass battle the 15% extra dodge chance might be nice, but 125% weapon damage isn't that much compared to SS chances of doing damage.  Maybe spend this on something else in the tree.<br />
<br />
Initiative - 3/5 points<br />
Gives you a 45% chance to add an additional combo point to your target when using your Ambush, Garrote, or Cheap Shot ability. -- Again, I needed to spend points to get up to Preparation.  45% chance is nice, but that's only with Ambush (opening move) realistically.  Not sure if 3 points is worth what will come out to be only one combo point or so in a single battle.  Maybe move these points to Camo?<br />
<br />
Improved Vanish - 3/3 points<br />
Increases your movement speed while vanished by 30%.  -- I like the idea of being able to move faster while vanished.  Not sure if these points should be spent elsewhere.  <br />
<br />
Preparation - 1/1 point<br />
When activated, this ability immediately finishes the cooldown on your other Rogue abilities. -- Definately a great ability as mentioned above I could Murder -- Evis -- Perparation -- Murder -- Evis (after building some combo points).  The whole point of this portion of the tree would be to get this one talent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And here is what I would take differently for a 30/8/13 build:<br />
<br />
<br />
Assassination Talents (30 points)<br />
<br />
Improved Instant Poison - 5/5 points<br />
Increases the chance to apply Instant Poison to your target by 10%.-- Need to build up the points to be able to get Seal Fate.  Might as well use this talent, although adding only a 10% chance for 5 points seems expensive.  Maybe better off spent elsewhere in the tree?  10% doesn’t seem like a whole lot, but I’m headed for Seal Fate so I need to spend the points.<br />
<br />
Seal Fate - 5/5 points<br />
Your critical strikes from abilities that add combo points have a 100% chance to add an additional combo point. -- The combo points could add up fast here allowing me to really land some nice damage but the draw back is that it only happens with Critical Stikes.  I'm not sure whether or not I’ll be critting enough to make this worth it.  I’m not sure I need the combo points enough to go ahead and take this and go without Preparation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat Talents (8 points)<br />
<br />
Same as above<br />
<br />
<br />
Subtlety Talents (13 points)<br />
<br />
Master of Deception - 5/5 points<br />
Reduces the chance enemies have to detect you while in Stealth mode. More effective than Master of Deception (Rank 4) -- Read above.<br />
<br />
Opportunity - 5/5 points<br />
Increases the damage dealt when striking from behind with your Backstab, Garrote, or Ambush abilities by 20%.  -- Read above.<br />
<br />
Improved Ambush - 3/3 points<br />
Increases the critical strike chance of your Ambush ability by 40%. -- Read above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are the two builds (of very close versions of) I’m looking at and I don't know what really works.  Anyone with experience with any of my problem areas can you help me in deciding?  It’s going to cost me a small fortune to re-spec so I don't want to have to do it twice.  I am mostly a combat build now, and it’s just not working out.  <br />
<br />
I am open to any and all opinions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I was told, and bear in mind this may be wrong, that 5/5 MoD = +2 to your level when opponents make stealth detection checks.<br />
At any rate, in my personal experiences, I havent noticed any difference without it and spending those points elsewhere has benefited me.<br />
