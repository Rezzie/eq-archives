<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, may I speak with Tom Hassell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask who is calling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so-an-so with so-and-so&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;how can I help you&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I have never aknowledge that I was indeed Tom Hassell... From this point depending on how the call goes I either ask them to hold and leave the phone sitting on the counter, or I scream at them, or I wait until they are all done and then I say:<br />
<br />
&quot;That's great, I willl let Tom know you called. He should be back in about 3 weeks&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-22-03, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's funny that they call you, ask you your name first, then ask you to verify information that they already had in order to call you.<br />
<br />
I always know when it's a telemarketer. No one calls me Anthony.   &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a big one....a tall drink of water, but I got to tell you, you don't look too bright. I got a son, stupid as a man who bought his stupid at a 2-for-1 sale, and you remind me of him.&quot; -Mr. Nancy</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lolanae</div><div class="date">09-22-03, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lately I get telemarketers calling asking for my fiancee.  He is on refit schedule at the moment, preparing for sea.  I tell them, &quot;He isn't here, may I take a message and tell him who called?&quot;   &quot;No we will just try back later&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm thinking to myself &quot;Sure thing arse, I bet you will be calling when he get shome at 8 oclock at night.  I know he will NOT want to talk with you then.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is on top of the calls I get that are basically hangups/wrong numbers when I answer.  Latest wrong number caller to piss me off was on my cell phone.  A lady called and asked for a couple.  I said wrong number, sorry.  Then she proceded to ask me if I know either of those two people.  I said no I don't ma'am, sorry, and hung up.  She called back asking for them again.  After snapping wrong number, she didn't call back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">09-23-03, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple years ago I got a call that opened up with a recorded message saying something along the lines of &quot;This is a collect call from an inmate at the Broward County Jail, press 1 to accept the charges.&quot;  Hmm?  I hit 1, and ended up talking to some woman who claimed my mom had been arrested.  This seemed unlikely.  While I can certainly see my mother being picked up in an animal rights protest, she probably wouldn't call me, and she certainly wouldn't do it through this intermediary.  The woman evaded my questions, so I said goodbye, called my parents, and confirmed that, indeed, Mom was not a guest of the Sheriff.  There wasn't even a charge for the &quot;collect&quot; call on my bill that month.<br />
<br />
I got the same call again not too long ago but just hung up on it.  It's always bothered me that I couldn't figure out what the scam was there.  Are there people who would attempt to post bail over the phone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">09-23-03, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So if you don't like them why don't you give totally bogus new contact info. &quot;No, I'm afraid he doesn't live here anymore. Would you like his forwarding address and phone number so you can contact him?&quot; I'm sure you must know someone who would enjoy the phone calls and junk mail.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nyssa Rainwhisper</div><div class="date">09-25-03, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The background noise of a call center and a pause after you've said hellow but before they say anything are dead giveaways to a telemarketer.  The minute I suspect any of that, I hang up.  I don't even bother.<br />
<br />
I don't care what they're trying to sell me even if it's a company I'm already doing business with (such as the phone company) I'm never interested anyways.  If I want it, I'll call them.  Till then, I'm content with what I have.<br />
<br />
Wraine, just out of curiosity, what should one say in lieu of yes? Edited by: Nyssa Rainwhisper  at: 9/25/03 12:19 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_jolla</div><div class="date">09-25-03, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of yes, you can normally repeat the question in the affirmative.<br />
<br />
Is this Jolla?<br />
This is Jolla.<br />
<br />
Is your address blah blah blah?<br />
That is my address.<br />
<br />
etc.  Although why you would tell a total stranger that info, i don't know, but it works for most questions. Jolla Petbane, level 65 Enchanter<br />
