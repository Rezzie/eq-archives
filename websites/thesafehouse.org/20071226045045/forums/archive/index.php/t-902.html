<br />
Lavie's dubbed voice is scaring me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pearll</div><div class="date">03-14-04, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Mrens.<br />
<br />
My cable company used to have TechTV, then they dumped it for the Travel Channel, of all things...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">03-14-04, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oddly enough, TechTV on my cable station is something that overwrites the normal stations, SOMETIMES.  Its on different channels at different times.  Its very irritating.  Though usually, there is an hour and a half of anime on latenight every sunday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_solesk</div><div class="date">03-15-04, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i tried watching this. the series seems pretty good, but they are comming at me to fast. the tivo records like 4 or 6 a day, and none of them seem to be repeats. i just cant watch that many to keep pace.  i gave up once there were 10+ episodes i havent watched.<br />
<br />
also, unless i'm missing something, they seemed to be showing a couple different anime, but all with the same title. so tivo just kept recording them all and i didnt know which one belonged with which series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">03-15-04, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the other hand, Tech TV seems to change series every week or two, and setting up season passes for all of them would be equally unwieldy.  They seem to usually include the series name in the guide data, but it looked pretty spotty to me.<br />
<br />
I don't get the channel, but my Dad does, and he's been letting them stack up on his TiVo for me.  We ended up watching the whole runs of Last Exile and Gatekeepers 21 yesterday (this didn't take as long as you'd think, lot of commercials on Tech TV).  Anyone know when they start airing the last half?</div></div><hr />
