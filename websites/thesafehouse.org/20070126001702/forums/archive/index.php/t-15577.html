1. Finding Bait --- Moyna<br />
<br />
She's a merchant on the docks.  Talk to her and she'll ask for you to go get her more bait.  If you do, then she'll send you to get centipedes from the Forest Ruins.  After you get them, come back and give them to her.  She'll give you money and  either a &quot;Paring Knife&quot; or a &quot;Fishing Spear.&quot;  I took the knife<br />
<br />
Stats: + 2 health, +2 power, dual wield, dmg 1-4, delay 1.2<br />
<br />
2.  Snakeskin for Soulforge<br />
<br />
He's the blacksmith in the armory.  Talk to him and he'll ask you to get snakeskins for a weapon or something.  If you agree, he'll send you to the Caves near Baubbleshire.  You get 10 and then come back.  He'll mumble something about not being able to pay you much because they are damaged, but will give you money and a choice of weapons.  This quest is good for anyone cause he has a wide variety of weapons.  I chose the blackened rapier.<br />
<br />
Stats: +1 health, +2 power, dual wield, dmg 2-6 (3-8 at lvl 14), delay 1.5<br />
<br />
Oakmyst Forest<br />
<br />
1. Proof of Poachers<br />
<br />
Talk to the Steward something or other.  He can be found up a hill where the Great bears spawn.  I talked to him and he told me to get proof there are poachers in the forest.  After I killed two poachers (they spawn at night near the deer paths), I took the proof to Tracker Galera.  She gave me a 2H staff. <br />
<br />
Stats:+1 int, +1 str, +2 health, +2 power, two-handed, dmg 4-12 (6-17 ay lvl 13), delay 1.7<br />
<br />
Forest Ruins<br />
<br />
1.  Vaughn's Stuff (Part 1)<br />
<br />
Talk to the Outlander Vaughn near the pond.  He's lost his satchel, letter, journal, and ring to the Ruin Stalkers.  He asks for you to get them for him.  After you've retrieved his items, he asks you to take a letter to Hunter Forest Deep<br />
<br />
Letter for Hunter Forest Deep (Part II)<br />
<br />
Take the letter from Vaughn to Hunter Forest Deep in the Willow Woods.  He is on a hilltop where he has cornered a bear.  After you hand him the letter, he thanks you by giving you a knife (isn't that sweet of him?)<br />
<br />
Stats:  +1 agi, +3 health, dual wield, dmg 2-6 (2-7 @ lvl 14), delay 1.2 sec<br />
<br />
<br />
Elddar Grove<br />
<br />
1. Hawk Hunt<br />
<br />
You can find Gregor Earthstrider in the bower shop in the corner.  Hail him and he starts talking to you about how he can't seem to find the hawks needed to make arrows (a ranger ... who can't find hawks ... yup, must be EQ).  He will ask you to do it for him and tells you to go to the Forest Ruins.  You need to kill 5 Antonican Hawks for their feathers and then return to him.  After you've handed in the feathers, he'll give you his old bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvorn</div><div class="date">11-16-04, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pardon the sketchy info. At work so i can't look at the weapons.<br />

<br />
Go back and she tells you to kill 4 Red Feathered Hawks Take the griffon ride by south qeynos to the oracle tower. (worth it just for the ride if you haven't done one. Just climb up the tower and out onto the platform) - only 4 spawns found). Fairly nasty area saw a bunch of agro red con mobs so be careful. Killed em at L14 soloing without trouble.<br />
<br />
Finally she will send you out to kill 7 Darkclaw crabs (Head north from the Thunder Steppes griffin station quite a long distance until you encounter the beach by the giant kodiaks. Many of the crabs were orange to a level 14) they go up to L18 bring a friend along.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tular Nodrop</div><div class="date">11-16-04, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I was JUST thinking about making a weapon quest post today. Thanks guys.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just did the Balance of Life quest. The quest was white at 17. I managed all of it solo as a predator. The hawks are red tailed hawks and you have to kill 3 of 'em. They're on the plateau of the oracle tower. Rewards are: <br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I took the dagger. Edit2: This thing rules... Shadow Blade does 160dmg with it at lvl 17.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joonling</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's awesome! I'm only lvl 13 right now, so the quests I'm doing are for my level or lower, obviously. I'm also thinking about posting about the armor as well since everything I'm wearing I've quested for.  It's funny, I've probably spent more time questing then doing anything else.  I'm a professional quester right now, heh.<br />
<br />

Starcrest Commune<br />
<br />
1. Essences for Obidudyn<br />
<br />
He's a scholar near the fountain in the middle of town.  He keeps muttering about how he wants to be left alone, but yet is still willing to talk to total strangers.  Must be an erudite thing.  Anyway, talk to him and he will tell you he wants to be able to summon pets, but is unable to without essences.  He then asks if you want to go to the Forest Ruins and kill 6 forgotten guardians for the essences.  When you return triumphantly, he will reward you with your choice of weapons.  Again I chose the Smouldering Dagger<br />
<br />
Stats: +1 int, +3 power, one-handed, dmg 5-14 (base 3-9), delay 1.7 sec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velvetrose</div><div class="date">11-30-04, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is also a very easy Quest in Oakmyst.  I cant remember exactly where it starts, but will go back and look tomorrow ...But as I was running about looking for rocks to mine, I stumbled on a large boulder that &quot;glowed&quot; when my arrow crossed over it but when I tried to harvest it the message I got was to &quot;examine&quot; it. This rock is near all the poachers.<br />
<br />
When I examined the stone there was a Poem to read.  If you finish reading the poem you are asked if you want to do a Quest.<br />
<br />
The quest is very easy it is just running around the zone looking for landmarks:<br />
<br />
The first one is the rock.<br />
<br />
Then a Tree&amp;lt;its in the middle of the pond&gt;<br />
<br />
The Overlook &amp;lt;its where the little squrril guys are...run up to the top near the rope walk way.<br />
<br />
The waterfalls, at the end of the pond with the tree<br />
<br />
Fay Overlook &amp;lt;run up on top of rocks near all the yellow fairies&gt;<br />
<br />
And the last is a hidden cave, its near the falls hidden by shrubs and trees.  You have to run all the way in and out fast if you are not in a group as there a a few mobs in there that will kill ya if you are 12 and under.<br />
<br />
Order may be wrong <br />
<br />
For all of this easy running about you get a very nice belt.  I will get the stats when I find the location of the boulder that starts the quest.<br />
<br />
Ohh Yes and there is anouther very easy one that starts in Baubbleshire &amp;lt;sp?&gt; for this you get nice armbands.<br />
<br />
Again I will get the name of the Dude that starts it but until then he is easy to find.  Hes a Gnome near the stream babbling about something as you run past him.  He had a red ring glowing at his feet.  Hail him and he asks you to go to the Forest Ruins and find the &quot;Ruins of the Mage&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried at first to go into the &quot;Castle Ruins&quot; and fight my way around but as I was soloing it was not working.  :beatup  I then decided to just cast the Pack Spirt  and run like hell thru the zone.  This plan worked.  I ran thru the door, up the stairs and all the way to the back...once I got back there I got the &quot;you have found &amp;lt;insert name here&gt; message and I bailed out with a bunch of mobs on my ass.  Thank goodness for the new &quot;run out of Argo range feature&quot;  I was almost ready to do the good ole OOC train to zone thing then I remembered  :)<br />
<br />
After you find the Ruins you go back to the Gnome and he gives you some cash and a choice of 4 different arm bands, they are different lvls so everyone should find something good. :applaud<br />
<br />
I guess this isnt weapon related...maybe I should have made a new thread?  My Bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">torvrogue</div><div class="date">12-14-04, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sage Xoort in Baubbleshire also gives a quest to kill forgotten gaurdians in Forest Ruins and gives a selection of weapons, get it and the Starcrest essence quest mentioned above at the same time.  The DW weap is called ember scarred axe i think.<br />
<br />
Actually the wandering Marshall in Baubbleshire also gives a quest to kill the guardians, so do all 3 at once.  The marshall gives a helmet as reward.<br />
<br />
Also someone in Castleview (I'll check later) gives a quest called &quot;Oh, deer me.&quot; that has you killing glade deer in Antonica.  She gives weapons as a reward too, the DW is a whip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eletur</div><div class="date">12-17-04, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow!  No one has mentioned the &quot;The Balance of Life&quot; quest, or something similar.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to part I (three parts)<br />
http://eq2.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?&amp;amp;eq2quest=382<br />
<br />
the weapons are great and are yellow to me at level 20 as a troubador<br />
I actually did the quest twice (once with my 15 warrior).<br />
<br />
There are 2 DW weapons, a 2hb and a bow.  I want to level up another character to get the bow next  :crazy<br />
<br />
eletur - 20 troub - nek</div></div><hr />
