Fortunately I had friends with me willing to play just as much as I was so i've got plenty of people at 60 to spend my time with.  I receive an insane amount of tells saying 'how does it feel to have no life and be alone at 60' and my response is simply 'I don't know'.  I don't think I couldve managed for this week without these people though.  I might actually had to have actively farmed for my 60 mount or something :/ *shiver*</div></div><hr />

Anyways, how does it feel to be a level 60 and Horde?  Pretty crappy, doesn't it?  Sure seems like a waste of your time, doesn't it?  Yup!  Reroll as Alliance, noob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would totally go against my whole purpose for being horde in the first place.  Killing Alliance.  You should reroll as horde instead ;p  Something tells me i'd have a little more to lose than you! :P<br />
<br />
And yes, for 900g (almost there!) you can get a 100% speed increase instead of just 60%.  For the undead it looks a lot better too, but currently for the other races (including mine, orc), it just looks like a different color mount that is already available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and I know why General is so much worse for Horde.  It's because every 10-year-old little idiot wants to be a &quot;kewl Orc!!!!&quot;  Basically, the Horde is a noob-magnet.  Yet another reason to reroll as Alliance.  Far more refined.</div></div><hr />

My original vision of the 10-year-old Noob, of which I actually created a brilliant artist's rendering, was a female Night Elf warrior with a pink mohawk, sans armor (so that the little boy could look at her butt as she ran).<br />
<br />
Buttttttttt.  Most of those people just play CoH and make tall, thin superheroines with body-hugging leather suits and watch THEIR butts as they run.  Also, it's pretty hard to look at cleavage as you play WoW because shots of your character's front are notoriously hard to procure.  Unless you just keep the character screen open all the time.</div></div><hr />

I should be midway through 38 right now--I had about 5000 rested experience left to fill, and two quests to turn in that would have dinged me to 38.  That was today at like 5.  6 hours gone by and no playing.  WASTED!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Playing on a PVE server you don't see the total low-game favoring the Alliance, but go to a PVP server and you feel it -- real fast.<br />
<br />
Alliance chars can get to level 30-35 without fear of being ganked, or even seeing another Horde PC.  For us Horde, we're thrown into the brutal world of ganking and higher level griefing the moment we outgrow the Barrens and Silverpine Forest (level 20).  Trust me, Horde newbies on a PVP server grow up REAL quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">12-24-04, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alliance chars can get to level 30-35 without fear of being ganked, or even seeing another Horde PC.<br />
<br />
Whatever! Ashenvale is one of the biggest &quot;no matter where you are, there's the horde&quot; zones I've found, and you start getting sent there at like.. 17. Wetlands isn't so bad, but it still has a constant horde presence. Hillsbrad? Duskwood? Where are we getting to 30 without seeing Horde? I got sent to Stonetalon just after 20, and Ratchet just after that. Sure there are some people who never leave Westfall/Deadmines until 30, but that's just them, not the way Alliance is set up. I'm quite sure many Horde don't set foot out of the Barrens/WC until about the same time, as they have much more to work with all in one giant-ass zone. <br />
<br />
As far as easymode in general, I was pretty disappointed to see the Horde poison quest is much beefier than the Alliance one. I'm curious if other class ability quests are similar. I really hope overall they're more balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trolo</div><div class="date">12-24-04, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No way, Tabbran.  I was seeing Horde right after I dinged 20, pretty much.  And yeah, my level 20 Succubus quest sent me into the Barrens.  Just east of Camp Taurajo.  So pretty DEEP into Barrens.<br />
<br />
Duskwood has plenty of Horde.  Wetlands is somewhat bad.  You get up to Hillsbrad, Alterac, Arathi--Horde everywhere.  If you're hunting Ashenvale, god, you can't avoid Horde even if you try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tabbran</div><div class="date">12-24-04, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no Horde outposts in Duskwood, Wetlands or Redridge Mountains.  Despite all of those zones being &quot;contested&quot; they are firmly in the hands of the Alliance.  There are zero Horde friendly NPCs, quests or flight paths for those areas.  This is in addition to the Alliance having access to Thousand Needles (flight path in Ferelas right on the border), Stonetalon Mountains (flight path on the peak), Ashenvale (flight path in Astranaar), and Hillsbrad Foothills (level 30 zone for Alliance, Southshore flight path).<br />
<br />
If you see any horde in Westfall, Redridge, or the Wetlands, they aren't hunting there, 90% of the time they will be passing through to get the flight point for Stonard (Swamp of Sorrow) or Kargath (Badlands).  The other 10% of the time, they're there to kill you because of the abuse they suffered in Hillsbrad Foothills.  It's not practical to be in those zones otherwise.<br />
<br />
Also, whenever I'm running through Westfall or any other lowbie &quot;Alliance&quot; contested zone, I get attacked by level 20-30 people (I'm 39).  WTF is with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trolo</div><div class="date">12-24-04, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Westfall isn't contested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tabbran</div><div class="date">12-24-04, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant Duskwood.  It all runs together.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my point is that Alliance has access to more, and by and large safer, content at the lower end than the Horde does.  This ease and low risk attracts newbies.  This is also why the Alliance outnumbers the Horde.<br />
<br />
The Horde experience is a harsh and unforgiving thing.  We like it that way.  You guys can have the newbies :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trolo</div><div class="date">12-24-04, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno.  Depends on server, I guess--I've heard of Horde outnumbering Alliance.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, there's no way a newbie can just magically know that the Alliance experience will be much easier lower level.  And if he joins Horde off the bat, he has nothing to compare his experiences with, so he won't know which is easier.<br />
<br />
Whatever, I've passed the newbie level.  I'm busy ganking and getting ganked.  It's all even.  Hehe.  Just got level 40 and my Felsteed tonight--woot, woot!</div></div><hr />

Ashenvale was pretty firmly horde when i hunted there, but the past few days the guys in my guild who are of that level have been complaining about high levels rampaging through splintertree outpost, hehe. Hillsbrad is noob gank land, but the worst place by far is nesingway's camp in stranglethorn - its gotten to the point where people will say in general &quot;hemet's camp is ours for next 10 minutes, turn in quests now&quot; and then it will change ownership, heh. Tends to be alliance more often then not when i went there, but i could always sneak up and turn in real quick before they realized i was there and sprint away.</div></div><hr />

Seems like Priests and Mages have this ability as well.  I'll fight a Priest, and they first thing they do is shield--and then I can't land any spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">12-25-04, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although the LotR factor is less at work with dwarves. Or less annoying. Try making a female gnome. Then try making a female dwarf. It's like female gnomes are universally trackable by adolescent males of gargantuan sublety deficiency. Guaranteed within 5 minutes of creation you'll get sexually suggestive messages. Whereas a dwarvish female can go for much longer without any of that.<br />
<br />
As a side note making a female gnome is an interesting experiment, someone should make a drinking game of it. Everytime you get sexually suggestive messages or emotes you have to take a shot. In that regard Horde gets the sweeter deal. Who's going to let it be known throughout the server that hot hairy moo moos are his idea of a good time?</div></div><hr />

Completely different.  The paladin shield actually makes the paladin immune, the priest and mage shields absorb a set amount of damage. (the priest shield just for abhorrently high mana cost, and the mage shield has an upfront mana cost and drains mana as the shield takes damage)<br />

I played a priest primary on laughing skull ... but decided after nearly 60 levels that I couldn't give up being a rogue and just recently rerolled as rogue on archimonde =\  (horde both)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then why is the first level 60 Horde?<br />
<br />
Thanks, now hush. Both sides are equally easy if you have the know how and skill to go after it the correct way. Instead you claim one side is easier to sooth your ego as to why you are being out-leveled by the other team.<br />
<br />
-L<br />
<br />
Edit: And while we are at it, Horde would seem the most logical choice for an inept player to go to on a pvp server. Afterall, all the 'Im 1337 and hardcore pk!!&quot; people are going horde (Just as they did with Midgard in DAOC). All the inept don't want to have to fight said people as they are intimmidated by them, so they go horde to try and leech off the more skilled pvpers.<br />
<br />
The horde also has control (and/or easier access)  of key locations. I haven't seen many (any) barracades for the horde to sneak around in contested areas. However, I have had to sneak past a few horde barracades to get to other alliance areas. Alliance classes (most notably warlock) constantly have to run into horde territory to get their pets. Lastly, when I am running through horde lands, I consistantly find plenty of horde sitting close to home instead of heading out, just as I am sure there are plenty of alliance doing the same thing.<br />
<br />
So sure, say we have the young children uninformed in pvp, and the noobs. I would take them in an instant over the cowards and the would-be elite. Noobs can be taught how to play well. The inept wanna-be pks are untrainable. That isn't even touching on the dink infested world of the &quot;I R UB3R PK!!!&quot; which has almost entirely gravitated to the horde realm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having to go around Honor's Stand and the Ashenvale barrier is so incredibly difficult.  As far as I know the Great Lift guards don't attack (because they both have quests), but that doesn't stop Alliance from killing them so people with the quests can't finish them.<br />
<br />
I've done both sides, I'll say it again:  The low end favors the Alliance over the Horde, especially on a PVP server.<br />

so which zone in alliance territory allows you to level to 30+ if you chose to do so like you can in the barrens wothout having to pvp once the entire time? This is a real question because I havent played the alliance above 20th.</div></div><hr />

Redridge Mountains, Wetlands, Duskwood.<br />

All are &quot;contested&quot; zones, there are no Horde outposts in those zones, therefore Horde presence is very very low.  There is nothing to offer other than the occasional lowbie grief which happens to us all the damn time in Hillsbrad.</div></div><hr />

I also don't understand how you can complain that we have it so much easier than you. Blackfathom (the first non crappy &quot;alliance&quot; instance) is always overrun with horde. Surprising, being you say Astranaar is so hard to get past by simple running around it.<br />
<br />
Personally, I spend almost all of my time in instances anyhow. They are much more fun than grinding random crap on the outside. Don't even try to pawn off deadmines as a perk either. You have shadowfang (and an earlier dungeon also) which is better than deadmines/stockades in just about every possible way including (but not limited to): looks, fun, story, opponents, and strategy.<br />
<br />
I am sure that the Monastery doesn't count for you, because it is 'high level' but it is sure nice having a dungeon right outside one of your main cities.<br />
<br />
I will ignore the paladin remark, because that is:<br />
1-High level issues (which you say doesn't count)<br />
2-Needs to be compared to a shaman, in which the shaman is more powerful anyhow.<br />

ok, so alliance can be ganked(whether it happens or not) from 20+ and horde can play in the barrens to 30+ and never once be killed in pvp? yup, Id say alliance certainly has it on easy mode :crazy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biral</div><div class="date">12-28-04, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where do you guys get horde staying in the barrens until 30+? Maybe if you want to grind green mobs or something over and over until then. Personally i got outta crossroads as soon as possible and moved onto hillsbrad, ashenvale, stonetalon and thousand needles to 30+. Horde doesn't stay in the barrens until 30+, we do come back for some instances  around 30 and then around 40, but no one stays there in between then. <br />
<br />
Easy mode is having contested zones that have a base for you and no base for the other side - Thousand needles for us, redridge, duskwood, wetlands, the hinterlands for you guys. I'm sure there are more for both sides that i'm forgetting. I don't know why the first 3 i mentioned aren't alliance territory - no one i know has ever been to those zones except to run through to other zones where we have bases.</div></div><hr />

There aren't any.  All four of the races of the Horde are simply more &quot;cool&quot; on a 7th grade level than the four Alliance races.  And of course, nobody in the world could think that being a Human is cool, so Alliance loses cool points right off the bat.<br />
<br />
Arguement? I can't persay think of an *arguement*, but, my brother, who is 13, his first choice was Alliance. All of his friends who play are Alliance. I watch him play, and the amount of people &quot;hu tipe lyke thiz&quot; is so large, it makes my head explode.<br />

Play a Horde and an Alliance character before you judge next time, please.</div></div><hr />

Well, Alliance has quite a large PVP advantage, atleast on Medivh(It's PvE). You attack someone, they come back and get their corpse, but with 5 other's their level.<br />
<br />
No, i'm not exagurating, and yes, this happens 90% of the time. I dueled a 41 Mage who had their PVP tag, and when I attacked(once the Duel had started), I got tagged Horde. So, their 4 friends jumped me and corpse camped me for the next 10 minute's.<br />
<br />
That's normal Alliance behavior on Medivh, atleast.</div></div><hr />

Oh my GOD the Hillsbrad Experience ;_;. I have recently become horde, I was questing in Hillsbrad and I have never seen anything like it on alliance side while playing. On alliance side, I thought STV was &quot;omgz I have been jumped again&quot; but no... actually alliance has no idea what being &quot;jumped&quot; is until they are horde in the hillsbrad. It is quite funny actually, and it does keep you on your toes. Good training. I recommend it to anyone. I imagine it is like horde boot camp.<br />

Right now I'm playing an alliance rogue and a horde warrior, and intend to get both to 60...  Obviously this is a PVE server...

On my server, Scarlet Monastery is consistently camped by 2 groups of Horde.  Who don't do the instances.  They just wait outside to gank Alliance.  So it happens on both sides.  Yesterday, my friend and I killed two Horde ONCE, and five minutes later there was a level 60 Undead rogue there killing us.  THAT'S pretty sad.  Of course, level 60's don't have anything else to do but ride around ganking, since there isn't a high end game...</div></div><hr />

If this is rare, you're really, really lucky. I see ?? people on Medivh running around in lower level areas clearing mobs/Horde outposts many, many times every day. Yes, I know this isn't a PVP server, but there's still PVP on PVE servers.<br />
<br />
An example, being, the local high end Alliance guild on Medivh camping Hammerfall for 2 hours one night. Cleared all the quest NPCs(and might I add, instantly, with only one group, so I don't know how that was working.) while quite afew of us were waiting to turn in quests.<br />
<br />
You try to do that in an Alliance outpost, and 40 Guards attack you.<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with PVP advantage on a server, only the willingness of people to leave what they're doing to kill someone. <br />
<br />
Part of the point i'm trying to make. Many, many more people play Alliance(Just go to STV and count the number of Alliance VS Horde. I see 10+ Alliance for every 1 Horde I see.), so the likelyhood to get jumped by alot more people when you're tagged PVP is that much higher.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless, I digress. Just, try playing a Horde and comparing it before you go making statements like this next time. Please.</div></div><hr />

My exact feelings in reverse. I play both Horde and Alliance, both on pvp servers, and I don't see the Alliance &quot;advantage&quot; that is being purported. Raids and gank fests go on in all the Alliance contested zones that were mentioned so far, every single day. (Save Duskwood. It rarely seems to get bothered for some reason.) Anyone saying it doesn't happen can't have played there.. it goes on all day long.</div></div><hr />

Well, I imagaine it does vary. I've only played Alliance on a PvP server briefly - just to check around and see how it was. What I said didn't pertain just to Horde - what I meant was, basically, don't make posts about how many 11 year olds play Horde, or Alliance, just because you saw one person act like an idiot.<br />
<br />
I can certainly imagaine the same goes on for Alliance that it does for Horde on some servers, i'm just saying, from what i've seen, there are not only more Alliance characters, but more of them that have nothing else to do except act like jerks.<br />
<br />
But, again, that might only been on the servers i've heard from/played on/checked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really?  Interesting.  Duskwood is the worst ganking area for sub-30 Alliance on Shattered Hand.  You have 40+ Horde coming up from STV all the time, ganking for an hour, and then leaving.<br />
<br />

<br />
I should think that Alliance/Horde population would vary server to server, so this is probably a moot point.<br />
<br />
Trolo, horde can hardly be considered to be camping scarlet monastary, considering its in a horde zone =/ They were probably waiting for more people to show up for their group or whatnot.<br />
<br />
True to a point about the Horde zone thing.  The rest of the zone, however, is a very low-level zone, so there's no reason that level 40+'s should be hanging around &quot;just because it's a Horde zone.&quot;  Also, we went into an instance and came out more than an hour later, and the same 12 Horde were still sitting at the entrance.  In fact, we saw several of the same people, always sitting at the entrance, always for hours, for about three days in a row.  Rather fishy.</div></div><hr />

I guess it depends on how much faith you have in wowcensus.  Overall, Alliance outnumbers Horde 2:1, and while it certainly does vary from server to server, I didn't see anywhere Horde outnumbered Alliance from just checking various server populations.<br />
<br />
On Argent Dawn, the number is about 3.5:1 of Alliance to Horde.  There are some servers where it comes kind of close... like Bleeding Hollow (most heavily populated) where you have about 12.5k Alliance going against 10.5k Horde, but I think it's relatively safe to say most, if not all,  servers are Alliance heavy.<br />
<br />
Note, however, none of these stats have to do with how many people are actually involved in regular PvP.  It was just to address the overall population balance.<br />

<br />
I just recently started playing Horde and what I've noticed is that I see the opposing side a LOT sooner than I ever did as my NE Rogue. I think I was probably 15th or so around Auberdine when I saw my 1st Horde player.<br />
<br />
As Horde it wasn't 20 minutes before I saw Alliance folks ganking low, low NPCs in Valley of Trials and Sev'whatever Village.<br />
<br />
And yes, Alliance has a serious mangina factor on all races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harvey</div><div class="date">01-26-05, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I think that's partly due to the quick server maturity, though.<br />
<br />
I now see singles and duos attacking newbie-type villages everywhere.  My second rogue (night elf) was made within the last week and there were Horde outside Dolanar (sp?).<br />
<br />
Having played both sides now quite a bit, it is still obvious to me that there is an Alliance imbalance.  I don't pretend it's that way on every server, but it has been noticable on the four different servers I've played so far (all PvE - some RP some not).  The most you ever see is one or two horde taking on guards in the 1-30 zones.  But you can see continuous raiding by larger forces of Alliance throughout Horde territories.<br />
<br />
And that's part of the issue with some of this arguement.  Talking about one or two people from one side killing guards on the other isn't notable.  But when you see forces larger than a single group in &quot;enemy territory&quot;, that's a more viable.  <br />
<br />
Playing Alliance side (on my servers, of course), I have yet to see a major offensive beyond contested territories.  Playing  Horde, I see it constantly.  Heck - the first week of the server there was an attack on the Crossroads by about 4-5 groups.  We held them back, but that was a pretty big raid for such an early point in the game.  And it has continued to today.<br />
<br />
Two days ago, I was in Tarren Mills and there was a huge battle occuring down at the tower near the road.  I fought for a while, but needed to do a few other things.  I go to Orgrimmar and people are recruiting for Tarren Mills when we get informed of another attack in Stranglethorn (at the same time, mind you).  But I had to fly to Ashenvale and when I arrive I see Alliance attacks on our outpost there.  In each of these, we're talking noticable forces, not just a mage and warlock duoing guards.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't think they were coordinated, though it might have been.<br />
<br />
The Horde were only able to really deal with one offensive at a time (we kept them out of Tarren Mills).  Now, that day showed me there was a significant imbalance in our server (Argent Dawn).  It was still fun, at least for us.  I don't see how it was too much fun for the Alliance, but I guess they like overwhelming numbers.  And they call us the Horde?   :beatup</div></div><hr />
