If the characters haven't learned the name in game, it shoudn't do anything.  Except mark em as the kind of players who are perfectly willing to use out of character knowledge in game.

AD&amp;amp;D- Hastur is one of the great old ones. Saying his name attracts his attention, and he always does does something about it (Send a minion, or show up in person).<br />
<br />
Not sure of the CoC rules on him. Probably gives you insanity points. But then eating a muffin gives you insanity points in CoC...<br />

What is that anyway, a CoC based Full Motion Picture I presume?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Letting the trailer finish loading so you can see the whole thing isnt a bad idea. H. P. Lovecraft's Dagon ... so it's not CoC based, it's based on the same author's work as CoC... Edited by: Elerion at: 3/2/02 12:08:02 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
CoC is a P&amp;amp;P game, where you play a character with insanity.<br />
<br />
There are many rules such as the books kills you, and you get insanity points for doing crazy things(awarded by DM).<br />
<br />
I'd guess imagniation is a big part(just like most p&amp;amp;p) and that you have to think of really crazy things to do, since your going to die and lose no matter what.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">03-18-02, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Call of Cthulhu is based on the horror novels of H.P. Lovecraft. It is set in a universe where mankind is an ephemeral incident in an ancient universe. The Gods are an evil, hostile set of TTMWNMTKs, and there are a load of ancient powerful near unstoppable beings called Great Old Ones. Who are sleeping or imprisioned about the place. Cthulhu is one of these.<br />
<br />
One of the premises of the game is that humanity exists in a sort of cosy delusion of importance, and as the truth becomes known the human mind is unable cope and goes mad.<br />
<br />
Magic involves calling upon these beings and their servitor races, and is essentially demon summoning and tapping of power. You can play a magic user, but you will have a relativly short career. And that's relative to a bunch of people with the life expectancy of a soap herring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although, to be fair, a surprising number of these TTMWNMK seem to be duffed over. Dormant in sunken cities, sealed underground, imprisioned in lakes on Aldebaran IV, sealed away so as to be unable to enter the world unless summoned, locked gibberingly insane at the center of the universe etc et-multiple-cetera, so I guess something harsh must have been done to them at some point by someone.</div></div><hr />

The DVD is a Brazilian release, and as such with only a marginal knowledge of Spanish the menus are essentially navigatable, but the DVD has original english audio, as well as at least english and spanish subtitles. Dunno about Spanish audio. Film was apparently released in 2001, no idea offhand when DVD was released, but it can be found on eBay.<br />
<br />
Currently playing in a CoC game based in modern day. Gunsmithing/Drive are good skills for someone in the party to have. Silver bullets (or whatever), and the ability to get away in a hurry. In fact, using my car I t-boned an enemy's van over a concrete divider, and said van quickly exploded (Thank you natural 20s) Fun stuff.<br />
<br />
 I'll have to pass the Delta Green link on to my GM, thanks.</div></div><hr />
