<br />
Boxtorrents dissapeared about a month ago, animeinfo has been down so I havent had a chance to look there.<br />
<br />
GTO is being liscened soon from what I hear, so I want to grab it before that happens. I saw a Live Action torrent and quickly ran the other way.  But if I can't get that, I need something else to hog up all my bandwith.<br />
<br />
I just started on hellsing, are there only 13 episodes?<br />
<br />
Twenty episodes of One Piece and I have only watched 2, I just can't get into that one since the style is so similiar to Naruto.<br />
<br />
I have Witch Hunter, but I dont really dig it and even now on Adult Swim I don't watch it. Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-24-04, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Almost everything in Boxtorrents is licensed. GTO was licensed years ago. The whole series is availble on DVD.<br />
<br />
The Live Action was very good imho. Yes, only 13 episodes on  Hellsing, but the manga goes beyond it. The storyline of One Piece is very different after 30 episodes or so.<br />
<br />
Witch Hunter is a like it or hate it from what I've seen. Watch Last Exile if you can. ____________________<br />

you do know there is filler arcs ? other than that the story is nearly the same as the manga , the first filler arc was 54-61: Gunkan Island</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dahne</div><div class="date">03-24-04, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Witch Hunter Robin is really bad.  There's more transparent deus ex machinas per episode than I've ever seen in any entire series.  Amon's extremely annoying. Yeah, yeah, you're the emotionless tough guy, I GET it.  I've never been disappointed to find out a character's not dead before.   The stuff about the witches and their powers is really cool, but there's maybe two minutes of that and ten of Robin staring into space and drinking espresso.  Robin's the only one in the whole group with an actual useful power.  Amon, Doujima, and Sakaki don't have one (Amon's lack of a power is mentioned once in passing, but no one ever even seems to notice the other two), and the other woman's is useless.  Ooh, I'm a psychic!  I can tell the general emotions around things!  The guy who shot this bullet was mad!  And she doesn't even do that very often.  The ending theme song's nice, but now that I think about it I can only remember one song from the show itself.  It's not as bad a series as, say, Blue Gender, but it's pretty damn bad.  <br />
<br />
So why can't I stop watching it?</div></div><hr />

What I was saying is that the differences between Naruto and One Piece become more apparent after the introduction arcs (introducing Zoro, Nami, Usopp).<br />
<br />
Edit: I just realized I might've confused you because I did some terrible grammar. I meant the Hellsing manga goes beyond the Hellsing anime, not that the One Piece manga is different than the One Piece anime. Sorry if that's what confused you.

<br />
Shingetsutan Tsukihime (like Witch Hunter Robin in style, but with a better constructed plot and character relationships)<br />
<br />
Hikaru no Go (&quot;sports&quot; anime about Go.  You'll either love it or hate it.  I, as you might guess, loved it.)<br />
<br />
Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu (very popular sequel to Full Metal Panic.  I have put off watching it untill I've seen the first series, but people keep raving about it to me.)<br />
<br />
Fullmetal Alchemist (not related to Full Metal Panic in any way.  Also very popular story.)<br />
<br />
Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu (hyper-energetic comedy.  Well crafted insanity is how I'd bescribe this show.  It's like a strange hybrid of Excel Saga and Azumanga Daioh.<br />
<br />
Stellvia of the Universe (it's like Candidate for Goddess, only it doesn't suck)<br />
<br />
Peace Maker Kurogane (samurai themed series with heavy mood swings between comedy and melodrama.  Mix of great and mediocre episodes, but the great ones more than make of for the ones that aren't.)<br />
<br />
PLANETES (realistic sci-fi drama.  Entirely character driven, so if you're not into those sorts of shows you can skip this one, but I find it refreshing.)<br />
<br />
Licenced<br />
<br />
Wolf's Rain (Made by a lot of the same people who produced Cowboy Bebop.  IMHO, it's even better.  Fairly original and engossing story.)<br />
<br />
Last Exile (Best work GONZO has ever put thier name to.  High flying adventure, interesting characters, interesting story, wonderfull animation, one of my favorites.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-24-04, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I'm very biased because I've played Shingesutan Tsukihime, but I found the anime to be extremely sub-par. There were too many plot holes. What I mean is, I know that it realistically can't cram the entire game into a 13 episode anime, however there was so much wasted time that could have been used to develop the story further but instead was used on pointless things.<br />
<br />
I finally got around to watching Hunter x Hunter, it is a decent anime. It sucked the first 40 episodes     but the OVA's and post-Hunter exam was worth it. The first 40 episodes had me yelling at the characters calling them idiots. I don't mean in the way Luffy and Naruto are, I mean genuine retards.<br />
<br />
Edit: Look foward to Midori no Hibi coming next month. If they do the anime right (hopefully) it will be one of the best anime of 2004 depending on what else is released this year. (based on the Manga) Edited by: Stalkyr Weaksoul at: 3/24/04 7:06 pm</div></div><hr />

Really?  Thats good.  Cause I watched the first ten episodes of One Piece and though, &quot;Man, this is like Naruto, only not drawn nearly as well...and the characters don't have nearly as cool powers...@#%$, pretty much the only thing this has going for it is its about Pirates&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once I'm finished with Gungrave I guess I'll keep going on One Piece now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_nekoken</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fullmetal Alchemist is licensed now I think.  Hmmm, or is it an unconfirmed license?  Can't remember.<br />
<br />
Personally I like the GTO anime better than the manga.  The manga is a bit too over the top in grossness in a couple of spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh maybe I'm just a sick @#%$ but it's the super grossness that makes me like the manga. However I equally like the more realistic J-Drama version of GTO, although it was a little bad at times (acting wise, but it could be a cultural thing).<br />
<br />
Fullmetal Alchemist is not licensed. Unconfirmed licenses are good as unlicensed (see: One Piece).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lamil</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as we've got an anime thread going, I've got a question about Scrapped Princess to pose.<br />
<br />
It's 24 Episodes total, and the plot resolves itself at the end, and a big &quot;The End&quot; comes across the screen. My question is, how is a series like this arranged? Was it planned to be 24 episodes and no more, or was the studio told to wrap it up and execute the plot at the end of a given season? It seems like a shame to create such rich characters knowing that the end is so closely in sight.<br />
<br />
Also, a comment on this week's Naruto. (76) I felt that it was pretty crappy. All we got was some of Gaara's childhood flashbacks. Maybe the episodes seem crappy to me recently because I just caught up with the series, and I'm still used to watching in batches of 5-6 and actually enjoying a little bit of plot progression. My disappointment also could be attributed to getting used to the quicker pace of Scrapped Princess. Any comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was only one spot in the manga that I thought was over the top grossness... the crap in a box.  And that was really early on.  I can't think of anything that came close to that since.  And even that I thought was hilarious. :P  Besides, the anime, as with most manga to anime conversions, cuts out a LOT of what it covers, and stops about halfway through the manga.<br />
<br />
RE: Full Metal Alchemist - Not licensed.  The only reason the licensing issue is coming up with FMA is because Funimation bought the domain name fullmetalalchemist.com.  Well guess what, they've done that before with series they don't have.  Last year they bought theprinceoftennis.com, and they don't have the license.  <br />
<br />
One Piece was a different issue though - it wasn't an unconfirmed license... Funimation outright stated at a con panel that they had One Piece and they were bringing it to the US.  Then they were asked about it repeatedly for a year about when they were going to do something with it, and all they would say was &quot;we're not saying anything about One Piece right now.&quot;  Then a few months ago, they reneged, claiming that the reporters read too much into what was said and didn't bother to confirm it with Funi.  BS.  There was no misunderstanding.  They said they had it.  Turned out they didn't have what they THOUGHT they had, but they said they had it.  They were asked about it repeatedly and wouldn't say anything for a year.  <br />
<br />
Regarding short series like Scrapped Princess: yes, they are typicly planned to be that long.  There are expceptions where episode counts are extended (Wolf's Rain - TV network asked for extra 'new' episodes to air during a planned off-period, BONES made 4 recap episodes, making the true length of the show 30 if you count the recaps) or things get cut to a conclusion abruptly to fit those planned number of episodes (Evangelion), but generally speaking that's the way it works.  Really there are a lot of 50-ish episode shows that work the same way as well - a planned run from start to finish.  <br />
<br />
Really that's the norm.  The continuously ongoing shows that run for years and years aren't uncommon, but they are in the minority. Edit: and yes, that's the common problem people run into with Naruto.  They get used to large chunks of episodes, then they get caught up, and try to watch one episode at a time, and feel like they aren't getting anything.   Edited by: notwen at: 3/25/04 6:30 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it's true that One Piece was named licensed by Funi, what I was referring to was their 1-2 years of &quot;no comments&quot; when they were asked if they really had it. If they really had it, it wouldn't be &quot;no comment.&quot; (EDIT: Whoops, it appears you already said that yourself and I completely skipped it somehow    )<br />
<br />
Typically most shows don't run past 13 episodes. It costs something like 30,000,000 yen per episode (300,000 US) and most either can't pay the needed cost up front or the gamble is too high to allow for more.<br />
<br />
Titles such as Naruto, One Piece, and Inu Yasha are allowed to run indefinetly due to powerful corporate sponsors backing them. Those with a 56 episode cap usually are manga titles that are extremely successful (Fullmetal Alchemist/Hunter x Hunter), or they have a successful director/author/etc.)<br />
<br />
Scrapped Princess fell somewhere in between. Not enough content to run 56, but a solid concept that studios were willing to invest into.<br />
<br />
Just a little bit of anime trivia    <br />
<br />
Oh, and here's one more. +2 geek points if you can name the only anime director in Japan that can pull a 1,000,000,000+ yen budget (10 million dollars approx) to make an anime. It shouldn't be hard to answer, but I'd like to see if someone can answer this     Edited by: Stalkyr Weaksoul at: 3/25/04 6:56 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dahne</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...Hayao Miyazaki?  Him or Shinichiro Watanabe.  <br />
<br />
Are the ones that only run 13 episodes not commonly seen in the US?  The basic number here seems to be 26.  If they stop after 13 due to lack of funds, I'm guessing it wouldn'tbe easy to get the cash to translate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not really how it works. The japanese companies don't translate it. There are American companies who buys the rights to distribute the anime in America, and those companies translate it themselves. So there's no cost to the japanese companies, it's pure profit (license fee which typically is in the millions + royalty.)<br />
<br />
If I had to try to guess what the marketers feel, it would be because 26 episode series ends up getting them the most buyers. For example, a 13 episode series likely is only 3-4 DVD's. However if it's a 26 episode series, it will be 7-8, so when people buy the first 3 DVD's, they feel 'obligated' to finish the series just because they already bought that many. Something like that, anyway.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and you got it right, Hayao Miyazaki is the only one who can do that  <br />
<br />
Another trivia, mostly because I want to tell the story, but I'd also like to see if anyone knows this one. It's a pretty tough one so +7 geek points. Name the first motion picture anime made   It's pretty tough! Edited by: Stalkyr Weaksoul at: 3/25/04 7:58 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, someone explain to me how a &quot;season&quot; of programming works in Japan?<br />
<br />
Do they just release a new episode every week until the series eventually ends?  Or do they have rerun periods like we do here in America?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-26-04, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's quite a good pick Norpin, but not it  <br />
<br />
The two oldest animes were Momotaro no Umiwashi and Momotaro no Shinpei, made in 1942 and 1945 respectively. (I am ignoring the manga films such as Norakuro and Dankichi which were from 1930-1933 or so).<br />
<br />
In 1942, Seo Mitso watched Fantasia (some of you should remember this, it was made by Disney) and fell in love with America's animation movies. As a result, it became his goal to accomplish a similar feat. That same year, he released the first motion picture anime, Momotaro no Umwashi.&quot;<br />
<br />
During this time, Japan was in war. It was a huge success. However, the Japanese Navy saw how popular anime was, and decieded to use it in order to make war propaganda (They were at war with the USA). So the Japanese Army asked Seo Mitsuo to make a propaganda anime, and gave him $270,000 yen (~4 million dollars).<br />
<br />
But despite the huge sum, it was very difficult to make an anime due to lack of supplies because the supplies that the animators used were given to the Army and News coverage as a priority. Not only that, the people who worked on the project were getting drafted to join the (at this time) losing war against USA. When the anime was about to finish, it was obvious that Japan would lose to USA.<br />
<br />
Momotaro no Shinpei finally got released in Osaka, April 1945. I watched this anime, it was very high quality considering the time, and pretty amusing. To summarize it, it was basically about a legendary japanese hero Momotaro who lead the Japanese naval squads against American ships, which amusingly enough was commandered by Popeye, Mickey Mouse, and Betty Boop.  <br />
<br />
However, during the release of the anime, people were unable to watch anime. We were bombing Japanese cities with gas and bombs, people were being drafted into the army only to die, and women and children were fleeing from the American army.<br />
<br />
Seo Mitsuo gave up faith in humanity, and was about to commit suicide. But almost as if a divine intervenation, he got a letter from a high school student who wrote- I was amazed by the quality of your work! I hope I can create such a masterpiece one day!&quot; And Seo regained hope and lived on.<br />
<br />
The war ended finally with the atomic bombs in August 1945. Momotaro no Shinpei was taken by the US because it was a propaganda film. Ironically, after watching this, the Allied army believed Seo is a great animator. He was given a job to... make propaganda films to support the occupation   (poor guy).<br />
<br />
I've already told a lot of the history, but this part is my favorite.<br />
<br />
In 1964, Seo was already long since retired. He wanted to make anime like Fantasia, but only ended up making propaganda films. He had just about given up on making more anime. One day, he was watching TV. THere was a new moving manga that was on TV for the first time, and there was a interview of the creator.<br />
<br />
(this part is taken from a different place, I dont want to type it all out)<br />
<br />
Interviewer: &quot;Why did you decieded to create animation?&quot;<br />
Animator: &quot;Well, back when I was in high school, I saw this beautiful animation called 'Momotaro no Shinpei,' and I said to myself 'I wish I could make something like this someday' I also sent the director a letter about my thoughts - I wonder if he read it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mr Seo began trying to recall if he ever got such a letter, he searched through his house to find the letter. The TV went into commercial: &quot;STay tuned for the new program, Tetsuwan Atom, coming up next.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Seo finally found the letter. It read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear sir, your animation was truly great! I would like to become an animator and create something as beautiful after the war ends.<br />
<br />
Yours truly,<br />
Osaka City Number 2 High School - Tezuka Osamu.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's about it  <br />
<br />
I really like this history. I read it somewhere long ago but I don't know where the source is, so I can't give any links, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-26-04, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no seasons in Japan. Things basically run 12-14 episodes, 24-26, 54-58, or without known end. They typically don't show reruns unless it is a massive hit (Naruto/One Piece/etc aren't considered massive hit [yet?])<br />
<br />
When something ends, another starts to replace it. But lots of anime typically begin at the same time (for instance, about 5 anime are starting in April.</div></div><hr />

My general rule of thumb for anime series is multiples of 13.  For some reason that seems to be the most common.  There are plenty of exceptions but the rule of 13 is true more often than not if it is less than 100 episodes in length.<br />
<br />
The stool sample was *exactly* what I was thinking of in GTO.  It totally grossed me out.  Not that the series isn't incredibly funny but ewww.<br />
<br />
You guys are getting me interested in picking up fansubs again, bastards.  I need to call my DSL provider and see if I can up my speed on my connection.  256 up/down just isn't enough when I have to use that connection for work too.  So far that's the only negative of living out in the sticks.</div></div><hr />

Fujisawa himself may have even thought he went a little overboard.    The stuff done in the last couple volumes (16 and 17) with Urumi and Miyabi was incredible.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure I could have found someone willing to do it for cost, but it took months just to find someone who would  rip me off, and I thought the extra $20 was worth it for the sake of convinence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TV series tend to be multiples of 13, because 13 weeks is one quarter of a year/one season. Unless they are cancelled, cut short or extended, of course.  <br />
<br />
OVA/OAV series can be any number of episodes they like, and can also have any individual episode length they like...but they are tending towards being more 'standardised' in episode length nowadays. Itzena Alhazared, Revenant of &amp;lt;Planeteers&gt;;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Norpin</div><div class="date">03-27-04, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, people in Japan really get the short end of it with OVAs.  They often get released one episode at a time, which means they only get one episode per tape/disc.  And here in the states we'll get two, three, or even four per disc, and I bet the discs always cost less here.<br />
<br />
As an example, Read or Die was a 3 DVD set in Japan, costing 5600 yen per disc (about $53 each, $159 for all three episodes).  Here, you can get one DVD with all three episodes for, at the most, $30. Edited by: Norpin at: 3/27/04 8:07 pm</div></div><hr />
