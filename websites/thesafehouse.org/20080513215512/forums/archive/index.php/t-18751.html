<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">namepending</div><div class="date">05-14-05, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So this honor system is only doing one thing:  making it impossible for people (in particular, me) to even get to level cap. I'm 47 right now and I get maybe two mob kills then I'm swamped by Alliance and I have to travel the map to get back to my body. I can't go anywhere; people are freaking nuts for these honor kills. I hope the battlegrounds do something to get these jerks off the zones or I'm done with this game. <br />
<br />
I'm on a pvp server because I like to fight other players and raids are so much fun but I don't plan on going around with a group of 60s and kill players 20 levels lower. It's just bully-ing. They should get dishonorable kills and there should be some penalty for doing that. <br />

<br />
If a level 60 or two level 60s try and take out a level 47 group they will die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Colvin</div><div class="date">05-16-05, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">level 60s killing a 47 don't get HKs(or maybe they just don't get points), so they are killing you for the grief of it, not to help their PVP rank, thus, it would happen whether the honor system was in place or not, and whether BG is in place or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Platt</div><div class="date">05-18-05, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I quit EQ for the sole reason that I didnt want to rely on a group for exp.  I have, so far, leveled up a hunter and a warrior to 50+ and find it extremely discouraging to not be able to go much farther solo.  Soloing is what attracted me to this game since a lot of times I cannot have a group rely on me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't have to group to level. You don't have to group to get killed by pks less.<br />
<br />
You DO have to group to hunt wherever you want. You can not honestly say that you believe there is ANY chance that I would let you live if I found you right?<br />
<br />
Honor, no honor, doesn't matter. If the name is red, I kill it (or do my best to try anyhow).<br />
<br />
Changing the system isn't going to fix your problem. There are more people out there like myself than you would care to admit. We kill because this is a PvP game with easily identified enemies.<br />
<br />
You have 3 choices:<br />
<br />
1-Move to remote areas which are less efficient.<br />
2-Group.<br />
3-Quit.<br />
<br />
The first is a lot slower.<br />
The second is for some reason wholly unacceptable to you.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
