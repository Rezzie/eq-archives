<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnerokk</div><div class="date">05-31-05, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok a buddy of mine and his wife are playing this game.  He wants me to join him.  After seeing I cant get anything near a shadowknight / dark knight, I have went to my backup character of a rogue.<br />
<br />
Let me state that this is on a PVP server and the have went with the alliance, im irritated cause I cant even be a troll.  I have instead decided to play a gnome.<br />
<br />
Now my buddy is playing a human paladin, his wife is playing a gnome mage.  My use will be to teh group as a combat fighter, however pvp as i get higher in levles would be nice from what he is indicating to me.<br />
<br />
My question is how do I build up the character to be a decent combat fighter with a switch to pvp.  I know I will be sacrificing some aspects of both ideas for balance.  <br />
<br />
If anybody has any thoughts on this please let me know, also if you coudl differentiate between a dagger and a sword setup it would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Now for my decision to play a gnome is based on the want to go after the engineering profession.  I have read about the two different schools of goblin and gnome.  If you can choose between both I will problay pick goblin cause the bombs interest me.  Does anybody have any thoughts on this.<br />
<br />
Last thing, I am playing this for fun, I wont make 50 or 60 or whatever and wotn care about high end raids.  I wanna play with my friends and chill and enjoy it.  I already have to many real jobs, this isnt EQ.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulthien</div><div class="date">06-01-05, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you could have rolled an night elf shadow priest. They do look like trolls except their ears give 'em more of a bat appearence :pulid<br />
<br />
You would be restricted to hammers as a priest, and cloth armor, but this looks fancy later on as well. Shadow Priests are, arguably, the most potent PvP class there is...<br />
<br />
As far respeccing your talents goes (for different char builds &amp;amp; experimentation) it costs you 1-5-10-15-etc gold to reset all talents and spec em anew, so not a biggie first 3 times :pulid<br />
<br />
Any race can learn the engineering profession here, not only the gnomes.<br />
I personally went with gnomish engineering as i dont like expensive 1-shot bombs that usually mutilate you as well in process of usage (approx what goblin engineering is). In gnome engineering, you get devices that do many funny and useful things: shrink the enemy (it loses 250 attack power!), mega death ray damage that overcrits, mechanical fight pets, nets etc.<br />
<br />
As a good counterskill to engineering, pick mining. Mining is the great obsession in the wolrd of Warcraft anyhows: many time you will risk your life and sound reason to &quot;get to next ore&quot; in time. A real bargain in fun/drive as i see it :pulid<br />
<br />
And, last but not the least, WoW is no EQ, so you can relax, have fun and roll both archetypes: gnome rogue and hunched bat err elf priest and see what fits you better and/or switch play (as the chars get blue exp when resting, its even nicer if you have 2 or 3 chars).<br />
<br />
cheers, hope you'll have as much fun as mewife &amp;amp; me have in WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OorTael5</div><div class="date">06-01-05, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally would not have picked a PVP server if you wanted to chill and have fun. With the honor system in place PVP servers are hell for leveling up. It doesn't bother us level 60 folks, but I feel for the lowbies.<br />
<br />
But anyway, on to your questions. A good build for a leveling rogue is to go combat heavy and use swords/maces. However, when you don't have a dagger equipped you lose the use of backstab and ambush if you did not know that already. Sub-60 a combat heavy rogue is also perfectly viable in PVP, as backstab and ambush don't really start to shine until the end game when you have a nice dagger.<br />
<br />
Spec down through combat to Blade Furry at least. DW Spec and Sword or Mace Spec are nice leveling up talents. Make sure you at least pick up Malice and Imp Evis from assassination tree and maybe some MoD from subtlety which makes life easier to sneak around.</div></div><hr />

I watched my hubby (gnome warlock/gnomish engineer) one shot a gold elite mob that was 9 levels higher than he was.  Gods, I love that thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, goblin bombs do not hurt you when you throw them.<br />
Second, Gnome devices almost never work<br />
Third, a goblin engineer can use any gnome device except death ray and battle chicken. World enlarger and one other. But 95% of gnome devices a goblin engineer can use. Whereas a gnome engineer cant use most of the goblin stuff and those they can have charges maknig it hard for them to keep a stock.<br />
<br />
Goblin can use the shrink that reduces atk power, net gun, fighting pets, almost every device you listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">06-04-05, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only problem with pve death ray is that it tends to aggro the enemy the instant you cast... I haven't used it as an opening attack in a while so it m ight have changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
might be, but i like to MAKE my own devices and experiment with them (like an engineer should). To throw ingredients on one shot goblin bombs is - IMHO - useless exercise (maybe also cos my engineer is mage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underdawg Darogue</div><div class="date">06-06-05, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah being a mage would make bombs not have much use to you. As a rogue though they are quite nice. I love hitting mages with my bombs. You blink and  freeze me be prepared for a couple bombs to come flying at you while you cast your next nuke at me :)<br />
<br />
Whereas if I used a net gun I am more likly to net myself then you, lowering your atk power accomplishes nothing, deathray can be interupted and may kill me in addition to you, battle chicken isnt much use when I have a arcanite dragonling.<br />
<br />
Fact is if you having mining sa you suggest he get. Then the mats for bombs arent expensive at all. They are free. And a 3 to 5 second stun can be very effective in any number of things.</div></div><hr />
