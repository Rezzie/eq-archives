Can easily make it back to Aragul, no deaths, etc...<br />
<br />
But get Aragul within a few hits of death, but we wipe...<br />

Two things come to mind right away:<br />
1) Get shadow protection potions from your local alchemist(and any other potions that would help)<br />
2) If you have a rogue, let him/her sneak up to Arugal before fight starts, there is no aggro when stealthed, so rogue can be ready to Ambush as soon as fight starts, instead of having to stealth up stairs while tank is already fighting for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
I think success can be vastly affected by wherever Arugal decides to jump to the ledge you can't get to.  Thats a few seconds of no melee that really hurts.  <br />
<br />
I think its important to start moving towards Arugal right away when he jumps, don't stand around for a few seconds wondering where he went.  Look while moving.</div></div><hr />

1. Is this beta-based information?  I found a quest that sounds identical to the one describes as &quot;Tome...&quot;, but it's called &quot;The Book of Ur&quot;.  I just want to make sure I'm not missing any other quests.  I found three - not five.<br />
<br />
2. Did they change it so that a rogue cannot pick the first locked door?  I went into the zone for the first time last night (at level 30) and cleared to the door, but could find no way in the world to pick the lock.  It was getting late, so I didn't bother with the &quot;free the werewolf&quot; way to open the door.  I just mainly wanted to see if I could pick the lock - but I couldn't find anywhere to start picking.</div></div><hr />
