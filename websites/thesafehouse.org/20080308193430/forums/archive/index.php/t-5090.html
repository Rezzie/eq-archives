To avoid migrain headaches due to eye strain I have ripped the site, enlarged the text and changed the color to black text on a white backbround. Boring but I can read it. Vulture 50th cleric <br />

And then on your website home page, tell your users to change their otherwise-acceptable browser font settings, and highlight all the text to get inverse colors.<br />
<br />
If your hit count gets you excited, you would probably get more if the site was more presentable.<br />

<br />
I for one have NO problem reading the page at home or at work with 2 different display settings.<br />
<br />
I like the way it loox and I like to have as much info on the screen as possible. Makes it easier to think things thru for me.<br />
<br />
In light of the honest response I will put it to all of you. Please cast your vote if I should change the page to have larger font and different colors. I will then consider doing this repeated request.<br />

Larger Font = NO<br />
Change Color = NO</div></div><hr />

Remember why you made the sight though...to help other people learn about the class.  Anything that detracts from the focus of the site is just annoying to users.  <br />

So instead of complaining and turning yet another forum into trash im gunna say:<br />
<br />
GRATS bro on the info, and the time im sure it took to write it is more of what ppl ought to notice than the COLOR. Beware of the Gods...For they have many faces.<br />

Shame all that info goes to waste, cause you like the &quot;look&quot;<br />

<br />
As far as presentation,the small print i can deal with,but red print on black background got to go bro</div></div><hr />

It looks like I just added to your hit count. But, friend - I have to say that 'hit' was about all I did. I stayed on the site for a few minutes but the microfont, red-on-black, and dense text formatting was just too much of a hassle to wade through to get the very good information I know must be there.<br />
<br />
I so much respect the work you have done on this site, but I must agree with folks who have given you the feedback that they'd like a change. Yes, I'll go back and print the info out at some point, but for me, I want a site I can get back to and visit...and I have to admit I'm not inclined to do that with yours.<br />
<br />
Thing is, a site can be visually *very* striking and still invite the viewer to hang out and read. Like this one - the safehouse does a great job of that. Another site that uses a black background and intense colors but is still a pleasure to read is mypetmage.com (the site for Hibernian mage classes). I'm just saying this to emphasize that it ain't black background/bright color per se that is the problem. It's just something about the way you put your current choices together that doesn't quite work =P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Red text is known to give gives eye strain and the font size is totally unreadable on a high res monitor. As much as I would like to read the site, I'll find the info elsewhere.<br />
<br />
If its just for yourslef, then fine, stick it back on your hard disk. If its to help other Infs then listen to what everyone is telling you and make it useable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cadori</div><div class="date">11-14-02, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you should keep the font and color! <br />
<br />
And i'm not just saying that because i'm a NS, and reading that page should make any inf go blind and miss his/her perf on me  .  To be honest though, I say change it.</div></div><hr />

I seek information to help me with my long road to greatness, and I had heard this was a site with alot of that information.  However, when I arrived at the site, I too was unable to read anything due to the fontsize.  And, so I respectfully ask, Zeemee, that you change at least the font size of the webiste, please.<br />
