The spells that paladins were forced to cough up 5k each for are being sold for 3 pp in the new zones hehe.<br />
<br />
This may cover other class spells too, Torpor maybe? <br />

It's a game you play with small white balls and a club,<br />
 but that's not important right now. <br />

I saw a few of the rare but older spells at merchants, but when I bought them (for 3pp, figured might as well) they copy was removed from the vendor. So, that would imply that someone had sold them to the merchants rather than them being available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It could also imply that perhaps VI only wants certain spells entering the game at a specific rate, so as not to completely wreck the spell economy? Just thinking of some random ideas here, hehe... it seems like it might be that. Of course, I'm not sure if the spell in the example was one of the no drop ones or not, but oh well... <br />
