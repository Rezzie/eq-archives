<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andorion</div><div class="date">03-23-05, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all!<br />
<br />
This is my first time posting in this sub-forum, although I'm a long time lurker in &quot;logged out.&quot;  I play a 60 Rogue on Archimonde, Horde, in the guild Nurfed.<br />
<br />
Last night a few of us went to Dire Maul, East wing, and there by the last boss (I forget his name, Azzasomething) sitting on the floor was a book: <br />
<br />
Garona: A Study on Stealth and Treachery (http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=18356)<br />
<br />
The book starts a rogue quest, min level 54.<br />
<br />
Quest: Garona: A Study on Stealth and Treachery (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=7498)<br />
Objective: Return the book to its rightful owners.<br />
Game Description: The tome carries the mark of Athenaeum.<br />
<br />
This is the only info given you.  There is a mob named Garona (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/mob.html?wmob=6767) listed in Hillsbrad, Ravenholdt, on Allakhazam's but it seems noone has had any luck finding him (I spent quite a bit of time last night looking too.)<br />
<br />
I assume this is for the rogue trinket from Dire Maul, so I'm really excited to work on this quest!<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what the next step is?  Someone mentioned something about &quot;turning in the book&quot; somewhere in West Maul - is that necessary?  Anyone else try this quest?  I should be going to West Maul today, so I'll update if I find anything.  I've seen various pieces of loot from DM, but I don't know if this quest has been completed (at least I haven't seen the reward.)<br />
<br />
Thanks, and good luck!<br />
<br />

I know for some of the rogue quests for the alliance at lower levels the quest person was stealthed and you would have to stealth to see them.  That was in beta though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried walking around stealth but didn't see him - I didn't really sweep the entire area, just all inside the building (and where the dot was on Allakhazam.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the final room in the West wing of Dire Maul are a bunch of NPCs where you turn in each class-specific book.  All you do is hand this one in, and your reward is the Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas (http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=18465)<br />
<br />
Trinket<br />
+10 Fire Resist<br />
Improves your chance to hit by 2%<br />
<br />
Pretty sweet!</div></div><hr />
