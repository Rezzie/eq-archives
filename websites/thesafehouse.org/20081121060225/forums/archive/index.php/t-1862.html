<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">09-20-03, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what kind of a rip off was that movie ?<br />
<br />
oh people love fast stuff ! we can't do cars lets do motorcycle film !!<br />
<br />
<br />
First : the kid who want to take revenge on some guy and then find that the guy is his father is OVERUSED !!!!<br />
<br />
Second : when people focus on something its not like a superpower , and Laurence Fishburne , THIS IS NOT THE FREAKING MATRIX<br />
<br />
Third : wow so the kid got his own gang , of around 10+ people and what they do ? NOTHING <br />
<br />
Forth  : Kid Rock , i have no idea why he was in the movie<br />
his char sucks , oooh the hero lost his bike , here have mine<br />
what the hell ? i saw that coming 2-3 miles away<br />
<br />
Fifth : the ending sucks , so the super focus power moved from the dad to the son in the final thing ? WOW WHO WOULD THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD HAPPEN !!<br />
<br />
Sixth : the kid say he have talents , he races 3 times in all the mvoie and i didn't see no talant ( he had superpower at the end , and his father wanted him to win ) <br />
<br />
so what he did the first 2 ?<br />
<br />
1 -  he jumped on other people race to screw them and let his<br />
partner win <br />
<br />
2- he was cought by the cops <br />
<br />
WOW , MUCH TALANT<br />
<br />
Seventh : since the co star had 3 races , how much total was in the movie ? lets count them<br />
<br />
1- smoke ( the father ) race with someone who lose balance<br />
and kill some guy who the kid thought was his father all that time <br />
<br />
2- the kid interept a race so his partner can win<br />
<br />
3- smoke race dogg ( kid rock ) and use the super power to win <br />
<br />
4- the kid race someone and the cops catch him<br />
<br />
5- final race , kid and father , both use superpower but the father loss so the kid can carry on the legacy<br />
<br />
WOW 5 RACES AND NONE WHERE FUN ! BEACUSE IT WAS EITHER INTEREPTED OR SOMEONE USED A STUPID SUPER POWER<br />
<br />
god why people fund these kind of stuff<br />
<br />
oh and also something else<br />
<br />
us.imdb.com/title/tt03267...st/2435891<br />
<br />
this was stupid also , but i didn't want to write about it since peoeple already whined about it :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
After watching it, Shehab your english reverted backwards 4 years...<br />
<br />
Stay away from these movies..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">09-22-03, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm worried that The Matrix might ruin Fishburn for all movies he's in after it.  You know, like Goonies did for Samwise. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dahne</div><div class="date">09-22-03, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the secret:<br />
<br />
If the writers can't be bothered to spell the name of their own damn movie right, it's probably not worth seeing.<br />
<br />

I can easily see him doing more shakespear or just really any other movie (as long as it's not a comedy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">09-25-03, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My tip off that it was a bad movie would have been that it starred Kid Rock.</div></div><hr />

He's a fantastic actor, guess he loves $$$$$$.</div></div><hr />
