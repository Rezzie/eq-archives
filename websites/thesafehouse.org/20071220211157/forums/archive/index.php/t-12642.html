<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinare</div><div class="date">08-06-04, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a website with guides posted about the different classes? My husband and I are trying to pick our two classes to play effectively together. I am probably going to do a healer type, he's probably going to do a tank/rogue/caster (offensive).<br />
<br />
Trying to figure out the best duo, where we can do the most stuff together, so we were hoping to read up on the classes and try to find something for us :)<br />
<br />
Advice is also wanted of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">08-06-04, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, any duo will work.  Since everyone can solo, everyone can duo.  =&gt;  The beta community site (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/) has decent overviews of everything.  It would just be a matter of efficiency.<br />
<br />
Mage/Priest would probably be on the lower end of the spectrum, since mages shouldn't be taking damage to begin with.  However, with Holy Word:Shield and respectable nukes and DoTs, a priest could tank while the mage nuked away.  Pretty much any other combination would just get more efficient from there on up.<br />
<br />
I'd hazard a guess that mage/mage, paladin/mage, or paladin/rogue would be the fastest duos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brogarn</div><div class="date">08-06-04, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Duo that I did up to 40 was Shaman/Warlock. So, I think anything is possible in a duo, especially if you know your partner well. The absolute safest duo would be Priest/Paladin. There's just no dyin there. ;) But seriously, both of you find a character that you like, and go with it. If you find yourself lacking, try something else. Best way to discover your playstyle both individually and together is to try things you like and go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telurinon</div><div class="date">08-06-04, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just about any Duo works well.  I'm very partial to Paladin/Mage duo.  Mage does incredible damage, summons water for the Pally, and can open locked chests they find.  Pally heals, can Rez, and Tank...plus can dish out some pretty hefty damage himself.<br />
<br />
Warlocks are among the best Duo partners out there, mainly because having a partner means they can really let loose - something they can rarely do solo.  Warlocks can also keep a steady supply of bloodstones and soulstones going to a group, reducing any downtime that occurs due to death and substantially increasing the chance of success on hard runs.<br />
<br />
Warriors I cannot recommend playing at all.  You'll find youself frustrated quickly.  In EQ, all a warrior is, is a meatshield.  You learned the role and lived with it...or re-rolled as another class.  In WoW, warriors have tons more abilities, and being essentially forced into Defensive Stance (the only one which lets you Taunt) while in groups means that 2/3rds of your abilities seem wasted.  You're doing a lot less damage than you could be doing and generating enough rage to do things is problematic if you are in a good group.  It's frustrating.<br />
<br />
Rogues are a decent duo class, if your partner is another rogue or really just about anyone except a mage.  If your partner is a mage, you may end up feeling a bit useless as a rogue -- things either die before they reach the mage, or they are a bit too tough to handle.  Finding an in between spot can be difficult.  Just about any other class makes a better partner for a rogue.</div></div><hr />

this is just looking at it from a PvE point of view? In PvP seems these 2 could be very potent together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telurinon</div><div class="date">08-06-04, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP Mage + Anything = teh win right now.  Combustion + Pyroblast = dead target.<br />
<br />
Rogues haven't been a big factor in PvP so far as I've seen.  They can take down unaware casters fairly easily, but in a straight up fight they pretty much get beat by any other class except warlock.  Obviously, player skill makes a big difference, but everything I've read seems to support this view.  Especially considering the fact Stealth isn't very useful in PvP currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bondori</div><div class="date">08-06-04, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rogues are not the class you want if you plan to PVP.<br />
<br />
Personally I would go with a priest/shaman and a war. War's are built perfect in this game, and they can really dish out the damage. If you pit a war against a pally the war will win almost any day of the weak.<br />
<br />
The shaman is a horde only character, which is probably why nobody here mentioned him. He's also super strong, and hand's down one of the best people to be in PVP combat. Both a shaman and a war can take down just about anybody in PVP, and that becomes really important later on.<br />
<br />
I (36 rogue) have played the entire game with my RL brother and best friend (40 shaman and 40 war respectively). I can vouch for the effectiveness of wars and shamans. Shamans can rez too, btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The middle of beta is not the time for absolutes.  Even if the game was live, I put more weight on skill than class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinare</div><div class="date">08-06-04, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all for the feedback so far =) I was wondering when someone would get to the PVP advice. Thanks Bondori! That is going to be our primary focus after we get our levels. I am pretty sure we will try one of everything at least, and find out a good combo. I was wondering how powerful the heals are between the shaman/cleric. Shaman looks best for defensive, but time will tell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bondori</div><div class="date">08-06-04, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PVP is by far the most enjoyable experience I've had in WOW so far. It's practically what I live and level for now-a-days. I didn't make a person on the PVP server (I didn't know how fun it would be until I had already started playing) but I still walk around most of the time with /pvp on. It's fun to encourage trouble.<br />
<br />
Priest and Shamans are both excellent PVP'ers, especially at high levels. I always see a level 50 priest roll-in to booty bay and lay waste to level 50 mages taking pot-shots from roofs. Shamans are the same way, there is just no escaping instant cast snares, nukes, and their power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brogarn</div><div class="date">08-09-04, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this weekend a friend of mine and I started up a Shaman and Priest on the PvP server. We're now level 21 and 20, respectively (I'm the shaman). PvE wise, we don't die much and put out quite a bit of damage. In fact, it's now my favorite duo. Being able to heal each other makes us nigh invulnerable. And with the combination of Holy Word:Shield and my Stoneskin totem, we've got defense WELL taken care of.  <br />
<br />
Offense is also well taken care of. I nuke well enough, and melee really really well. I'm using a dagger and my Rockbiter buff. It adds +11 to every hit right now, so with a dagger being a fast hitter, I have a hell of a damage output melee wise. I also have that nifty damage shield that's unresistable as far as I can tell. The Priest has a hefty amount of nukeage himself, so his damage output is nothing to sneeze at either. And in WoW, there's no disparity between the weaponskill of a melee class and a caster class as far as regular hits go. So it's actually worth it to melee as a caster. Warriors and Rogues still have styles and special attacks that put them ahead in the melee category, so don't worry about that. I'm just saying that getting out your weapon as a caster is still a decent amount of damage output and well worth it.<br />
<br />
I'm frankly surprised about how well this combo has worked out. I truly recommend it.<br />
<br />
I can't comment on PvP yet, as we're too low to make a dent on the level 50's we typically see. It's rare that we see anything in our level range, so haven't had that experience yet. They're looking at taking out the resistance based on level bit in PvP, though. So hopefully, when I cast a lightning bolt at an Alliance punk, they'll at least feel a tickle as opposed to nothing at all. :D</div></div><hr />
