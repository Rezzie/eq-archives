<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-19-04, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, neither an assassin or brigand will ever be able to live in Qeynos.  If you want to be good I'm almost positive both swashbucklers and rangers deal out an impressive amount of damage (so do the bard classes actually, unlike in EQ1).<br />
<br />
Most of what I've read makes the brigand (or rogue classes) more like the traditional EQ1 rogue class in that they have a constant stream of high DPS.  The assassin (and probably ranger) specialize in one huge hit (or opening hits) but then has a longer refresh time until they can act again (and most of their attacks are from stealth).</div></div><hr />

Is it true that a evil class can't be in a guild of good ? .... they told me that i couldn't betray the city, cuz then i wouldn't be able to get guild points or soemthin ...</div></div><hr />
