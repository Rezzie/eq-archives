<br />
I am at 188 and I had enough for 25 attempts, Spirit of Sloth was killing me running to FV. So I tried and failed all 25 attempts.<br />

<br />
I was asked to make Mind Melt for friends when I was around 200 skill level (needed for 9th Coldain Ring, Avalanche Ale) and found that even when I reached 230 skill level, I was failing too much to use this poison to build skill. Even if you save money Cinnibar/gnomish spirits/farm Mt death salts vs buying creeper ivy, if you are failing a great deal more you are also losing the cost of Ethereal Suspension each attempt and also, less to sell back to the vendor.<br />
<br />
I would guess it was close to double the failure rate Spirit of Sloth. At 250 it's still not trivial. I have very few failures at SoS and can do 50 doses without a failure. At 250, Mind Melt doesn't come near that success rate. I think I still fail 1-2 out of 5 attempts.<br />

<br />
You have a 5% chance of making it pre-200<br />
<br />
<br />
The longer version:<br />
<br />
Mind melt is not trivial at 250. Based on my rough experiences, it still fails a good bit of the time. From this, and some work people have done approximating the success rate formula, you can work out some basic info, like an approximate trivial level. Knowing that you can work backwards to a success rate at 200ish.<br />
<br />
Now this is VERY crude, but figure for each point below 250, your success chance drops about 1%. (Slightly more actually.) This is an estimate based on the success rate formulas, which themsleves are approximate.<br />
<br />
So by the time you drop down 50-60% in success rate, you're about at the minimum success rate of 5%. <br />
<br />
So if you really need one and just want to brute force it, you will succeed sooner or later. But it's going to be a major hassle.<br />

so try to get a bard friend</div></div><hr />

I raised to 235 and got a decanter of the apothecary (so 242 skill) and will pass the success rate for this level (will do this sunday).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_HarloweRogue</div><div class="date">09-05-02, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the decanter adds to your success not your skill level ...or so it was said in another thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Talabrina</div><div class="date">09-06-02, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm does it actually make a difference?<br />
With 199 skill lockpick and 2% picks you can open door needing 200 skill, i believe all focus items work the same way, and that they do increase skill (if mechanical didnt raised skill you could NOT open a 200 skill door with 199 skill and the mechanical picks, and mechanical would be useless as they used to be for ages)<br />
Your trained skill is unchanged by the decanter, i believe that the focus item add &quot;focus points&quot; based on your rank and the % modifier of the item to give a &quot;modified&quot; skill level (which is not displayed in game) which is the one used by the game engine for assessing successes.<br />
Also as success is directly related to skill level, i dont see how raising the success rate can be diffentiated from raising the skill. That just my opinion.<br />
I totally agree that the focus item do not help raising skill faster.<br />
Also, i guess i need to use more DEX next time. Edited by: Talabrina at: 9/6/02 2:38:56 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Blackgallon</div><div class="date">09-09-02, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had poison skill to 215ish just to make avalanche ale, with right buffs at that level was successfull 50%.  After spending 3 aa's in class on poison skill..  went from 215 to 250 in like 2 hours form creeper ivy sloth poison in FV.  This skill made a huge difference finishing off skill.  Only failed 1-3 times in 40 combines post 220, ended up making pp's instead of losing.  Didn't have any stat buffs either, recommended for anyone planning on doing skill, the no fail apply is nice too.  This was also without the 3% mod thing, with the success I was getting I preferred to keep the dex from main weaps. <br />

What do most of you charge for them?<br />
<br />
Getting components is not too hard My main is a 60 Wizard and myself and a pally friend goto Droga and AE for components. Can normally get 20 in 2 hours or so.,<br />
