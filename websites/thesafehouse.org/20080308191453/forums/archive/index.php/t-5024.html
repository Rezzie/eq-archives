<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">04-15-02, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've spent a good deal of time fighting purples to me (players and NPCS).<br />
<br />
It appears to me (sorry no hard stats to back it up) that I have a better chance of hitting using any of my special attacks than just regular attacks (regular attacks tending to be complete misses).<br />
<br />
But above that, it appears that Pincer tends to hit more frequently and with greater damage than my other attacks.<br />
<br />
I'm a developing &quot;Critblade&quot; so my points are currently in critical strike, stealth (my highest right now because I wanted to get climbing early for personal reasons), and envenom with some in sword (soon to be rectified to be higher than envenom).<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice something similar? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Drolk</div><div class="date">04-15-02, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As players move around easily enough that a side attack is nigh impossible to achieve while unstealthed, the only time I ever use Pincer is in PvE groups when a tank is holding aggro.<br />
<br />
On reds I don't worry much, as most styles come off pretty frequently, but on purples I will switch to Pincer almost exclusively (until I pull aggro :P) and it hits a lot more often.<br />
<br />
I believe the style sheets show it as &quot;very high to-hit bonus.&quot;  It's priceless when you want to contribute to a fight that's over your head on any other style. Drolk - L43 Kobold Shadowblade (Tristan)<br />

It does about 4 times as much damage add.  Even if I miss twice as much, it's better.   Edited by: Lisboa at: 4/15/02 2:15:14 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
in groups pincer is  the style I use 99.95% of the time.</div></div><hr />

I've used it on sitting casters and stealthers with good effect.<br />

<br />
I've never noticed any stun effect on Pincer like there is on Backstab II.  I'll have to pay closer attention next time. Ciardha Sidhe, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-16-02, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No stun component.  If it does, it's not good for P v E in some groups, because it will count towards one of the diminishing return stuns, whereas a healer can do a 9 second stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">04-16-02, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes pincer does not stun. It just does great dmg for the endurance plus has a high to hit ratio.<br />
<br />
It is noticable if you are fighting purple with a small party. (I group with a paladin and cleric friend and we take on purples all the time.</div></div><hr />
