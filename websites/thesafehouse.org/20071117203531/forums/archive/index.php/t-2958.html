I'm looking for a game that we can play in a modular fashion rather than campaign due to time contraints.<br />
<br />
Old AD&amp;amp;D (1st ed) was very good for this (born as it was from tabletop minuture rules etc)<br />
<br />
So my question is:<br />
<br />
  Can anyone recommend any good 1st (low level) modules currently available for 3rd edition?<br />
<br />
(when i looked in my local shop could only see higher level modules)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Was looking for Modules not Mudules. I suppose multi-player modules in NWN should be called 'mudules'   Edited by: Fablar at: 6/29/02 5:23:22 am</div></div><hr />

Do you mean Return to Temple of Elemental Evil? Levels 4-14 (I looked at that thinking it was a good choice) but wondered if there were any good level 1-4 modules.<br />
<br />
I remember Village of Hommlet as a stand-alone module as well. Was it T1?<br />

<br />
Not like its too hard to adjust the difficulty of it either.  DM just needs an hour or so before you start playing to look through it.</div></div><hr />

I believe it was for level 1's, though im not sure.<br />

Fun module regardless</div></div><hr />

There would be some fees up front, but in the end it would be about right for having just bought the modules.  Basically, you can play what's called a Home Day, with the added bonus of being able to take your characters to living city games at conventions.  They have modules for all levels, including some Introductory modules for levels 1-2.  There are some modules to avoid from when they were shifting management recently (For example, DON'T play Art Imitates Life) but most of them are pretty good.<br />

<br />
If you can find it the origional Pool of Radiance was a great module. Curse of the Azure bonds was pretty good too, but you have had to have read the book for Curse to make a whole lot of sense at some points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG the memory's<br />
<br />
That was the role playing gam ei ever played about 17 years ago.<br />
<br />
Played a Paladin.<br />
<br />
second game was .....sumthin...Salt Marsh.<br />
<br />
Played a halfling Rogue that time and kept him going to 14th level.<br />
<br />
Damn I miss them days......well partly...dont miss the lack of female company and trouble gettin served with beer</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was a damn fine module that one. The majority of modules in 1ed were very poor design with the standard room, monter, treasure design. Especially the Gaxygygar ones TBH.<br />
<br />
A lot of the UK range were very good as well.<br />
<br />
If the design of the new &quot;Return/Elemental Evil&quot; is improved on the old hack/slash formula then it might be worth a look at indeed, even though I said non-Campaign. The reason for non-campaign is that i would normally run campaigns that would require a lot of work by me .. and i just don't have the time these days - and we don't play enough hours a week to get into the 'continuity feel' of a campaign.<br />
<br />
Anyway .. i've got a few ideas from this thread thanks all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">return is more than hack &amp;amp; slash, quite a bit of puzzle stuff and mystery to be had there. great module, should check out more of monte's stuff :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleh, why would anyone make a modual for level 1 characters anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops, I fell off my horse *roll* and died&quot;<br />
<br />
I hate level 1...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fablar</div><div class="date">07-21-02, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funnily enough I did buy a module the other day for 1st level characters .. &quot;The Sunless Citadel&quot;. Looks quite a good module - quite simple but with a few elements that a decent DM can work with.<br />
<br />
Of course, straight away after reading it, I just saw the elements i wanted to pillage and possibly base a game on Hope Mirrels Lud-in-the-Mist (good book, if no-one has read it - but not to a lot of peoples tastes i would imagine).<br />
<br />
Hehe..I want to play an 'out-the-box' module and end up just pillaging for ideas again.</div></div><hr />
