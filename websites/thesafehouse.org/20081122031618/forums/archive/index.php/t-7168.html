<br />
I have spent the last week hunting giants in GD and I now con &quot;ally&quot; to the dwarves in Thurgadin.<br />
I am assuming that I am now an ally in both Coldain and CoV factions.  Is this a correct assumption?<br />
<br />
Also, I know there is a quick way to find out (i.e. going there)...but I was wondering....does that mean I an now an ally of Lord Yelinak in Skyshrine?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

They give +Coldain and +CoV faction. I have killed about 300 of them this week.  I guess I need to kill alot more, though, to get allied to dragons.</div></div><hr />

Kromzek giants on the other hand only give CoV, but a much bigger hiut than Kromrif.<br />
<br />
In addidtion You start KoS to CoV, where you only start apprehensive to coldain. I think by the time I was Ally to coldain, I was threadening to CoV. Ishwar - level 59 Barbarian Rogue - GM smith</div></div><hr />

Problem is, while it takes 100 kills to get ally to the dorfs, it takes about 5 times that to get ally to the dragons.<br />
<br />
Best way I can think of is inside Kael.  The giants up in the arena and tormax arch area don't give coldain faction, but they do give some nice dragon faction; especially the named ones.  Move out of those 2 areas into the rest of Kael (such as the manor, etc.) and you'll get + coldain faction as well.<br />
<br />
I always thought it was rather amusing that you have to fight inside the arena to get most of the armor drops for the coldain quests, but you get no faction for those same coldain in doing it.   <br />
<br />
Bottom line, most (not all) of the Frost giants you kill will give Coldain faction and the Storm Giants will give Dragon faction.  Sometimes ya get luck and one of em will give ya both kinds of faction, sometimes not.  Get a hit on Vindi or AoW to get a good faction boost as well. <br />

<br />
Take these to Skyshrine.  When you zone in, open the portcullis and go right.  Just up the stairs is a drake named uhh Lieutenant Blahblah.  Give him the toes and helmets one at a time for faction + some coin.<br />

It will take about 5 times the amount of kills doing GD giants/wolves to get ally CoV than it does to get ally coldain.<br />
<br />
Do Kael arena for a few hours and take a couple of hits from Vindi if you can.  That will speed up the process greatly. <br />

<br />
If you want to get ally to Yelinak be present at a Tormax-Raid and politely ask if you can stay to get a faction hit. Veteran ShadowCross Bladesong<br />
