Basically WoTC is looking for new blood, er worlds.  They want to put together a fresh new setting and want us to do it for them.  Evidently Forgotten realms and DL are getting too old or something  <br />
<br />
Anyways, i will be putting together some of my labor of love that i primarily developed during highschool and submitting it. <br />

He's been designing games for years and we've been recently playing in a rather interesting D&amp;amp;D world he designed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">06-11-02, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, which is why I'm encouraging him to come up with something else on the fly. He's got a few other 'worlds' we've visited that would easily be fleshed out into full campaign world ideas. =)<br />
