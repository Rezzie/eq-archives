I've been working on a public domain set of rules for running campaigns on Dragaera that imitate the fast-paced combat style of the Vlad Taltos novels.  If anyone would like to playtest it, I'd happily post it here.  It'd probably be pretty brutal, though - high character death rate expected. =P   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver<br />

<br />
However I have neither, so hehe I wouldn't be much good playtesting  <br />
<br />
I'd be happy to read over the rules if you wanted to email 'em to me, and give you suggestions and/or point out things where I think something could go wrong.  I just read through the series in the last 6 months, so they're relatively fresh.<br />
<br />
Kroe is a huge fan of the world.  I'm not sure if he's a P&amp;amp;P gamer though.  You may wanna email him and ask.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dragaera<br />
Rules and Settings for Roleplaying<br />
<br />
Rules and settings for running a Roleplaying Campaign in Stephen Brust's world of Dragaera.<br />
<br />
Dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d20, and d%.<br />
<br />
Races:  Human (Easterner) and Dragaeran (Elf).<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Human: (known as Easterners to Dragaerans)  Humans are the most populous race of Dragaera, mostly living in the eastern jungles of Fenaria.  Humans reach maturity at 15 years and have a life expectancy of roughly 75 years.  Average height for a human is 5.5 feet.  Statistic Adjustments: Dexterity +1, Witchcraft +2, Bonus Character Points.  Humans are quick and have an affinity with Witchcraft that stems from their cultural usage of it.  Humans are also quick to learn skills, gaining an additional character point for each die of character points they obtain.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Dragaeran: (known as Elfs to Easterners)  Dragaerans are the ruling elite of Dragaera, who hold the power in the Empire, living mostly in central Dragaera and in the capital city Adrilankha.  Dragaerans reach maturity at 100 years and have a life expectancy of roughly 2000 years.  Average height for a Dragaeran is 7 feet.  Dragaerans have pointed ears and cannot grow facial hair.  Statistic Adustments: Strength +1, Sorcery +2, House Adjustments.  Dragaerans are bigger and stronger than Humans, and have a culture steeped in Sorcery.  In addition to base statistic adjustments, each Dragaeran belongs to a House, which gives them additional bonuses or penalties. (Note: Dragaerans refer to themselves as Human and to humans as Easterners.  This can cause some confusion.)<br />
Phoenix: +1 to System Shock and Intelligence.<br />
Dragon: +2 to Sword and Strategy rolls.<br />
Lyorn: +1 to Wisdom, -1 to Intelligence.<br />
Tiassa: +1 to System Shock and Reflex.<br />
Hawk: +2 to Wisdom, -2 to Diplomacy rolls.<br />
Dzur: +2 to Sword rolls, +1 to System Shock.<br />
Issola: +2 to Diplomacy and Appearance rolls.<br />
Tsalmoth: +2 to System Shock.<br />
Vallista: +1 to System Shock, +1 to Reflex.<br />
Jhereg: +2 to Dagger rolls and Reflex.<br />
Iorich: +2 to Appearance rolls, +1 to Wisdom.<br />
Chreotha: +1 to Intelligence and Landcraft rolls.<br />
Yendi: +2 to Intelligence, -1 to System Shock.<br />
Orca: +2 to Seacraft rolls, +1 to Strength.<br />
Teckla: +2 to Reflex, -1 to System Shock, +2 to Landcraft rolls.<br />
Jhegaala: +2 to System Shock, -1 to Reflex.<br />
Athyra: +2 to Intelligence and Sorcery rolls, -2 to Wisdom and Witchcraft rolls.<br />
<br />
Statistics: Each of the five statistics grants bonuses or penalties to particular skills.  The base for each statistic is 10 - anything over 10 grants a bonus, while anything under 10 imposes a penalty.  Each 2 points over or under 10 increases the bonus or penalty by 1.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Strength: (STR)  Measures physical strength and fitness.  Grants a bonus or penalty to weapon damage, as well as to physical activity rolls, such as lifting, running, swimming, or climbing, as well as affecting your movement speed.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Dexterity: (DEX) Measures hand-eye coordination and agility.  Grants a bonus or penalty to weapon attack rolls, as well as to coordination skills, such as Reflex, Pick Lock, and Sleight of Hand, as well as affecting your movement speed.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Health: (HLT) Measures physical hardiness, determining hitpoints and granting a bonus or penalty to your System Shock skill.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Intelligence: (INT) Measures Intellect and ability of analytical mental processes, granting a bonus or penalty to Sorcery, as well as to intellect-based skills, such as Strategy, Manipulate Device, and Bluff.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Wisdom: (WIS) Measures awareness and knowledge, granting a bonus or penalty to Witchcraft, as well as to awareness-based skills, such as Hide, Awareness, Appearance, and Diplomacy.<br />
<br />
Rolling Statistics: At character creation, roll 4d6 five times, discarding the lowest die each time.  Then arrange results as desired, and roll an additional d6 for bonus points.  Distribute the result of the final d6 among your statistics any way you desire.<br />
<br />
Raising a Statistic:  During play, you may raise a statistic above its current value by spending a number of character points equal to double its current score - for example, to raise a Strength of 14 to 15, you would have to spend 28 character points.  Raising statistics is expensive and difficult, so most players raise their skills far more than their statistics.  However, it can be useful to bring down the penalties from a very low score.<br />
<br />
Skills: Skills form the meat of character development in Dragaera.  Skills are seperated into three categories: Default Skills, Supplemental Skills, and Special Skills.<br />
<br />
Default Skills: These are skills that every character has at least 1 rank in at character creation.  You recieve one free rank in each of the following skills:<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp System Shock (STA) - Determines your resistance to System Shock, from spell attacks, poisons, severe injury, or other effects.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Reflex (DEX) - Determines your ability to move quickly away from something harmful, such as an explosion, spell, trap, or attack.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Melee Attack/Defense (DEX) - Determines your attack and defense capability in melee combat.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Ranged Attack (DEX) - Determines your attack capability with ranged weapons.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Movement Speed - this is actually a score, not a skill - add your Strength and Dexterity scores together to determine your Movement Speed.  The result is the number of feet you can move per round.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Psionics - This skill allows you to communicate psionically with other people.  It's not recommended to put additional points into it, unless you possess the Advanced Psionics skill (see Special skills)<br />
<br />
Supplemental Skills: These are skills that a character must learn during play.  A character must gain at least 1 rank by training in a skill to begin spending character points raising that skill - training may only be done by a character with 4 or more ranks in the appropriate skill, and takes one week with active instruction, or two weeks with passive instruction (such as written materials).  Each Supplemental Skill gains a bonus from the requisite statistic whenever you make a roll on that skill, just like Default Skills.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Appearance (WIS) - Determines physical appearance.  Characters with a high Appearance skill tend to gain favor in social interactions.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Awareness (WIS) - Determines awareness of surroundings - very useful for detecting a hiding character.&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp <br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Bluff (INT) - Determines ability to feint, lie, and decieve.  Characters with a high bluff skill can be very tricky in social situations.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Bow (DEX) - Determines skill with bows and crossbows.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Dagger (DEX) - Determines skill with daggers and knives, as well as other small bladed melee weapons.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Diplomacy (WIS) - Determines skill in diplomatic matters.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Dart (DEX) - Determines ability with thrown weapons, such as darts, throwing knives, shurikens, and other thrown objects, even stones.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Fist (DEX) - Determines unarmed combat skill.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Garrotte (DEX) - Determines skill with strangling weapons<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Landcraft (WIS) - Determines ability with land-based skills, including farming, weaving, smithing, and other tradeskills.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Hide (WIS) - Ability to remain unnoticed in a crowd, or to be undetected while infiltrating.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Manipulate Device (INT) - Ability to manipulate, enable, or disable devices, such as machines or traps.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Seacraft (WIS) - Determines ability with sea-based skills, such as shipbuilding, navigation, seamanship, and swimming.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Sleight of Hand (DEX) - Determines ability to do tricks of dexterity, such as juggling, palming a weapon, or picking a pocket.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Sorcery (INT) - Determines skill with Sorcery.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Staff (DEX) - Determines combat ability with a staff or stick.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Strategy (INT) - Determines ability to perform acts of strategy, such as directing a battle or planning a raid.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Sword (DEX) - Determins ability to wield a sword, greatsword, axe, or other large bladed weapon in combat.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Whip (DEX) - Determines skill with whips or chains.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Witchcraft (WIS) - Determines skill with Witchcraft.<br />
<br />
Special Skills: These are special skills which are much more difficult to acquire than normal skills.  Typically only by spending a large number of character points can a character gain a single rank in these skills, in addition to finding a method in-game to learning them.  Once learned, however, they can be raised just as an ordinary skill can, with one exception - Special Skills can only pass beyond the rank of 10 by spending 100 character points per additional rank.  Special skills do not have relevant statistic modifiers.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Advanced Psionics (30 points) - Advanced Psionics grants additional bonuses to either Sorcery or Witchcraft, improving their power by two points per rank.  More importantly, if you possess at least 5 points in Advanced Psionics, you may use the Psionics skill to cast Sorcery spells without drawing on the power of the Imperial Orb.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Pre-Empire Sorcery (50 points) - The study of using raw chaos to power one's magic.  Pre-Empire Sorcery is much more powerful than normal sorcery and is not subject to many defenses that can thwart or block normal sorcery.  However, Pre-Empire sorcery is very dangerous - a critical fail on a spell roll that involves Pre-Empire sorcery can result in the release of uncontrolled Amorphia, most likely resulting in the instant death of the spellcaster and everyone within several miles.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Sneak Attack (10 points) - The terrifying skill of the assassin, Sneak Attacks allow the attacker to force his target to take a negative on his initiative if the attacker attacks first (which is equal to the attacker's Sneak Attack skill), and if the attacker wins, the defender gets no defense roll and the attacker automatically scores a critical hit and deals triple damage.  If the attacker's Sneak Attack skill is 5 or greater, the attacker actually deals quadruple damage upon a successful Sneak Attack.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Multiattack (15 points) - The skill of the master fighter, this allows you to make two attacks as a Normal Action (see Actions under Combat)<br />
<br />
Character Advancement:  Typically, after each session, major event, or adventure, the DM will award character points for events experienced by the players' characters.  Each character rolls a d6, and recieves a number of character points equal to the result of that roll (or equal to the result of that roll + 1, if the character is an Easterner).  Sometimes DMs may award one or two additional character points for exceptional roleplaying, at the DM's discretion.  Remember that character points may only be spent on learning new skills if the character has receieved adequate training to learn the new skill.<br />
<br />
Rolls:  Generally, to have your character do something, you make a roll.  This is accomplished by rolling a d20, generally, and adding in relevant modifiers.  For example, to attempt to hide from someone, you would roll a d20, and add the result to your Hide Skill and your Dexterity modifier.  For example, if Ishtvan has an 8 skill in Hide and a 12 Dexterity (a +1 bonus), and he rolls a 14 on his d20, then his Hide roll is a 23 (14 + 1 +  .  If you don't have a Dexterity modifier (for example, your Dexterity is 9, 10, or 11) and you don't have any ranks in the Hide skill, you can still simply roll a d20 and take the result as your attempt at hiding.<br />
<br />
Automatic Success or Failure:  Any time you roll a natural 1 on a d20, your attempt always fails, no matter what.  Similarly, if you roll a natural 20, your attempt always succeeds, no matter what.  (Special: Attacks that roll a natural 20 automatically hit, with no defense roll allowed, and have a chance to score a critical hit.  For further information, see Critical Hits under Combat.)<br />
<br />
Penalties:  Sometimes, you may have to make a roll under adverse conditions, such as making an awareness check during a storm, climbing a cliff in the rain, casting a spell while dodging a dagger, or making an attack while upside-down.  Under these situations, you incur a Penalty on your roll.  Penalties come in three classes - Minor, Standard, and Severe.  A Minor Penalty is a -2 on your roll, a Standard Penalty is a -5, and a Severe Penalty is a -10.  Examples:<br />
Climbing a cliff in the rain: Minor<br />
Casting a spell in a hurry: Minor<br />
Attacking while running: Minor<br />
Climbing a cliff while under attack: Standard<br />
Parrying a Ranged Attack: Standard<br />
Dodging a Melee Attack: Standard<br />
Casting a Spell while dodging: Standard<br />
Attacking while prone: Standard<br />
Climbing a cliff during an avalanche: Severe<br />
Casting a Spell while being seriously injured: Severe<br />
Parrying an attack with a Ranged Attack: Severe<br />
Attacking in Zero-Gravity: Severe<br />
<br />
Syntax for adding a penalty is &quot;Making a roll at Standard Penalty&quot; for standard, and similar for other types.<br />
<br />
Combat: There are several rules governing combat maneuvers.<br />
<br />
Initiating Combat:  Combat begins whenever someone makes an attack.  All parties involved in combat roll an Initiative Roll, determined by a d20 plus the character's DEX bonus or penalty.  Sometimes a character may be forced to take a Penalty on his or her intitiative due to mitigating circumstances.<br />
<br />
Time in Combat: Combat time passes in Rounds, which represent six seconds of combat.  All actions taken during a round are assumed to be happening more or less simultaneously, although some actions may be the result of other happenings during that round.  All combatants determine their actions at the beginning of the round, and then the actions take plance in sequence, starting at highest initiative and going to lowest.  If a combatant wishes to change his course of action (called &quot;Challenging&quot;) during the combat round, he or she must make another initiative roll when his or her turn arrives.  If the combatant's new initiative roll is higher than his or her previous initiative roll, the Challenge succeeds and the combatant may change their course of action.  If the attempt fails, however, the original action takes place instead.<br />
<br />
Example: A combat begins, with Ishtvan, Ellissa, and Quaysh contronting a Jhereg boss and three of his bodyguards.  Everyone concerned rolls initiative - Ishtvan rolls a 17, Ellissa rolls a 12, and Quaysh rolls a 7 - the Jhereg boss and his bodyguards roll an 11, a 6, a 16, and a 5.  Ishtvan, with the highest initiative, moves first, attacking one of the bodyguards and wounding him.  Next, one of the other bodyguards, acting on initiative 16, attacks Ishtvan and injures him seriously.  Ellissa, who had been planning to cast a spell on the Jhereg boss, now sees that Ishtvan is wounded, and wants to Challenge her action so that instead she can heal him with her Sorcery skill.  Ellissa makes her Challenge roll, rolling a 9 and adding her Dexterity statistic for a total of 10 - unfortunately not good enough to beat her previous initiative.  If she had succeeded at her roll, Ellissa could have dropped her spell and healed Ishtvan instead, but now she can only watch as her spell paralyzes the Jhereg Boss, but it may be too late for Ishtvan as the other two bodyguards close in on him.<br />
<br />
Actions:  Each character may perform &quot;actions&quot; in combat.  An action is defined as making an attack, moving your speed, casting a spell (although some spells take more actions to cast than others), or various other actions you might take in combat.  Some things you might want to do take more time than others, such as drawing a symbol, reloading and winding a crossbow, put out flames, or some other things.  A few other things can actually change whether they are an action or not depending on your skill (for example, drawing a weapon takes a Normal action if you have less than 5 ranks in skill with that weapon type, and a Free action if it does not).  There are three types of Actions: Free, Normal, and Double.  Free actions are considered to take less than a second, and you can make up to 6 of them per turn.  Normal actions are considered to take up about three seconds, and you can make two of them per turn.  Double Actions are considered to take the full 6 seconds of your turn, and you may only make one Double Action at the expense of any other non-Free actions that round.  Some examples:<br />
Quick-Drawing a weapon (more than 5 skill with that weapon type): Free<br />
Release Concentration on a spell: Free<br />
Drop an item: Free<br />
Drop to the floor: Free<br />
Speak: Free<br />
Move your speed: Normal<br />
Draw a weapon normally: Normal<br />
Stand up from prone: Normal<br />
Make an attack: Normal<br />
Open a Door: Normal<br />
Pick up an object: Normal<br />
Pick someone's pocket: Normal<br />
Psionic Communication: Normal<br />
Coup De Grace: Double<br />
Light a torch manually: Double<br />
Cast most witchcraft spells: Double<br />
Load and crank a crossbow: Double<br />
Extinguish Flames: Double<br />
Escape from a net: Double<br />
<br />
Movement:  Typically, to take an action, you'll have to move your character somewhere appropriate.  Use your character's movement speed (STR score plus DEX score) to determine their maximum movement per round.  If you're using a grid, it's suggested to make each square on the grid a 5-foot increment.<br />
<br />
Making an attack:  First, you must move your character in range - if he can get that close!  If you can reach your target, and you still have at least one Normal action left, you can then make an attack.  First, you make an attack roll - Roll a d20, and add your Melee Attack/Defense skill (or Ranged Attack skill, whichever appropriate for the type of attack you're making), your Dexterity modifier, and (if applicable) your ranks in your skill in that weapon.  (For example, Ishtvan, attacking a bodyguard with a dagger, rolls a 12 on his d20, adds his 5 ranks in Melee Attack/Defense, his +1 dexterity modifier, and his 7 ranks in Dagger for a total attack roll of 25.)  The defender then must make an opposed Melee Attack/Defense roll against your attack (or a Reflex roll, if it's a ranged attack or they want to try to dodge a melee attack - dodging melee attacks from adjacent squares are made at Standard Penalty, however.).  (The bodyguard, in this case, rolls a 9, plus his 6 ranks in Melee Attack/Defense, but he has no dexterity modifier - he does, however, add his 4 ranks in Sword.  In this case, his defense roll is 19, not good enough to defend against Ishtvan's attack roll of 25.  Ishtvan hits, and deals damage.)  If your attack hits, you roll damage - dice appropriate to your weapon damage, plus any additional bonuses from a high strength score or a magic weapon. (Ishtvan rolls a 5 on his d6 from his dagger damage, plus an additional 2 damage from his Strength of 14.  This deals a total of 7 points of damage to the bodyguard.)<br />
<br />
Taking damage: If you take damage from a weapon, spell, or other injury source, you're in trouble.  You need to make a System Shock roll to keep from being stunned, and your result must be at least double the amount of damage you just took, or you'll be stunned.  (Example: the bodyguard from above takes 7 points of damage, and rolls his System Shock roll to avoid being stunned.  He rolls a 12, but his System Shock skill is only 4.  What's worse, he has only 10 Health, and since he's taken 7 points of damage, his health counts as a 3 - imposing a -3 penalty on his System Shock roll - making his total a 13, just barely short of the 14 he needed.  Stunned and bleeding, the bodyguard drops to the floor - no help this combat round, and probably easy pray for Ishtvan if the combat continues.)<br />
<br />
Being Stunned: If you're stunned, you typically stagger into the nearest support - wall, table, chair, whatever's within 5 feet of you.  If there are no supports within 5 feet, you're in trouble - because that means you can't support yourself and you drop to the floor.  If you survive until the next round, you'll probably have to spend a Normal action getting back up.<br />
<br />
Critical Hits:  If you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, your attack is considered to be a &quot;Critical Threat&quot;.  Your attack automatically hits, and your opponent must make his defense roll.  If your opponent succeeds, the attack deals normal damage, but if not, the attack deals double damage - which is usually lethal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Being Attacked:  If someone else attacks you, you're in the same situation they were - you need to make a Melee Defense or Reflex roll to avoid being hit.  If your roll exceeds theirs, you avoid or parry the attack - if not, you're taking damage.<br />
<br />
Severe Injury, Unconsciousness, and Death:  Losing any Health is bad, but there are worse things than being stunned.  If your Health reaches 0 or lower, you're considered seriously injured.  You must make a System Shock roll to avoid becoming unconscious.  If you take any additional damage after reaching 0 hit points or lower, you must make another System Shock roll, or become unconscious.  Once you're unconscious, then the real trouble starts.  If you take any damage while unconscious, or after one minute (10 rounds) of unconsciousness, you must make another System Shock roll to avoid dying.  If you succeed, you must make another System Shock roll after one hour, and for each day after that until you regain consciousness.  If you ever reach -10 Health or lower, you must make a System Shock roll each round or die.<br />
<br />
Dying:  Dying's a bad business, although it's not that unheard of in Dragaera.  Luckily, dying isn't always the end of your career.  The level 6 Sorcery spell Revivication can return most characters to life after being slain, except for under the following circumstances:<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Brain or Spine damage - these parts of the body do not regenerate.  Anyone killed by Brain or Spine damage (possible when killed by a critical hit, a sneak attack, or a coup de grace) cannot be revivified.  Any critical hit has a 10% chance to deal Brain or Spine damage when it is the killing blow.  Also, Sneak Attacks and Coup de Grace can be specified to target the head or spine, although Sneak Attacks that do this incur a Standard Penalty on their attack rolls.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Corpse Decay - a corpse may only be revivified for three days after its death.  After that, the spirit passes away beyond the reach of mortal magic.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Morganti Weapons - These soul-destroying weapons consume the spirit of those they slay.  Anyone killed by a Morganti Weapon is dead forever, and cannot be either Revivified or Reincarnated.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp <br />
Fatigue:  Fatigue comes in two flavors - Physical and Mental Fatigue.  Mental Fatigue is caused by spellcasting, while Physical Fatigue is caused by injury and exertion.  Every consecutive 5 rounds of combat, you accrue 1 point of Physical Fatigue.  If you take damage to your Health, you've accrued an equivalent amount of Physical Fatigue - a negative on all your attacks and defense.  For example, if you take 4 points of damage, even if you make your System Shock roll to avoid being stunned, you'll be at -4 on all your attack and defense rolls, as well as your movement speed and skill checks.  Physical Fatigue goes away at the rate of 1 point per minute.  Even if you're magically healed, physical fatigue doesn't go away - if you're wounded 6 points and then healed the following round, you still have 6 points of Physical Fatigue to deal with.  Mental Fatigue is a little different - it inflicts the same penalty on all your rolls, movement, and checks, but it goes away much faster - one point per round.  Certain kinds of spells can cause Mental and Physical fatigue as well.  If you sustain 20 or more points of Physical or Mental fatigue, bad things can happen - you must make a System Shock roll of DC 10 + Half your current fatigue (usually totalling 20).  If successful, you're fine, but if you fail, one of two things can happen.  If you accrue over 20 points of Physical Fatigue and fail your System Shock roll, you're Exhausted and collapse, unable to move until your Physical Fatigue drops to 10 or below.  If you accrue over 20 points of Mental Fatigue and fail your System Shock roll, you suffer permanent mental burn and lose 1d6 points of Intelligence and Wisdom and must make another System Shock roll.  If you fail this second roll also, you die.<br />
<br />
Special Actions in combat:  Some actions are a little more complicated than moving, attack, and standing up.  Some of the following:<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Trip:  You can attempt to trip, bowl over, or bodycheck an opponent.  Make a melee attack roll at Standard Penalty.  If you beat the defender, he is knocked prone.  If you fail, however, you are at Standard Penalty to defend for the rest of your turn.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Cast a Spell or Use Psionics: action times may vary - however, you are unable to defend manually while either casting a spell or using psionic communication.  You may, however, roll Reflex to avoid attacks - usually at the cost of your spell or psionic connection.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Disarm: You can attempt to disarm an opponent's weapon.  Make a melee attack roll at Standard Penalty.  If you beat the defender, you can either knock his weapon to the ground up to 10 feet away, or take it in any free hands you possess.  If you fail, you are at Minor Penalty to defend for the rest of your turn. (Note - you can attempt to disarm an opponent with a Ranged weapon by making your roll at Severe Penalty)<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Deal Subdual Damage: you can attempt to deal nonlethal damage with an attack in an attempt to knock your opponent out without seriously injuring or killing them.  Make an attack roll at Minor Penalty (no penalty if you're using a blunt weapon).<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Defend:  You can forgo any attacks that round to concentrate on defense, forcing any opponents that attack you to roll their attacks at Standard Penalty.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Tumble:  You can attempt to roll past enemies or obstacles.  This is a Double Action - you can move up to twice your Movement Speed and make Reflex rolls against any attacks made against you, at no penalty.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Grapple: You can attempt to grab, throw, strangle, or otherwise manhandle an opponent.  Make your attack roll with no weapon skill modifiers (the defender must do the same), and add your Strength modifier instead of your Dexterity.  If you beat the defender, you can grab him.  If you begin your action with someone grabbed, you can throw them up to 5 feet for every point of strength modifier that you possess (thrown persons take two points of damage for every point of the thrower's strength modifier, plus an additional point of damage for every 5 feet they fall - if, for example, they're thrown off a building), you can Strangle them for normal or subdual damage, your choice (strangling inflicts 1d6 points of damage plus strength modifier per round).  It's important to note, however, that damage taken from being strangled does not force you to make a system shock roll or be stunned.  If you have skill with a garrotte, you can add your Garrotte skill to your Grapple roll, and strangling with a garrotte inflicts an additional 2 points of damage per round.  You can only deal Normal damage when strangling with a garrotte, however.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp When you're grabbed or grappling: You are at Standard Penalty to Reflex to avoid other attacks (in addition to Standard Penalty to Reflex against attacks from melee range), and you can't defend with your hands (obviously), so this can be very dangerous when you're facing multiple opponents.  If you initiated the grab or grapple, you can end it at any time.  If you did not, however, you must beat your attacker in a Melee Attack/Defense check (again, with no weapon modifiers and adding Strength instead of Dexterity) to break free.  If your hands are free and you can reach a Small weapon, you can attempt to attack your grappler at Standard Penalty.  The other grappler may defend at no penalty.<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp When you're being strangled:  Ouch.  If your attacker is behind you, you're in trouble - you'll have to beat him or her at a grapple check to get loose of the stranglehold.  If the attacker isn't behind you, and you can draw or reach a Small weapon, you can attempt to attack your strangler at Standard Penalty, and they may defend by Reflex at Standard Penalty.  If your attacker is behind you, you can still try to attack with a small weapon, but you'll be doing it at Severe Penalty.<br />
<br />
Average Weapon Damage:  Typically, each type of weapon does a particular die of damage.<br />
<br />
Fist: d4<br />
Whip or Chain: d4<br />
Staff or Stave: d4<br />
Dagger: d6<br />
Dart: d6<br />
Bow: d8<br />
One-Handed Sword or Axe: d8<br />
Crossbow: d10<br />
Two-Handed Sword or Axe: d10<br />
<br />
Special weapon damage modifiers:  Some melee weapons can be used two-handed - those that are gain a 1.5x bonus to strength damage when they score a hit.  (For example, if Virt is wielding a longsword two-handed, and has a strength of 14 (+2), she deals 1d8 + 3 points of damage on a successful hit).  Daggers and darts cannot be used two-handed, however, nor can Rapiers, and Two-Handed Swords and Axes may only be used one-handed by making attacks and defending at Standard Penalty.<br />
<br />
Wielding Two Weapons: Anytime you make an attack with more than one weapon in a round (ie, using two hands to fight), you roll both your attacks at Standard Penalty.  However, you do not take any penalty to Defense while wielding two weapons. (Special - Using the Multiattack skill is attacking more than once with the same weapon, and does not incur any penalties to either attack or defense.)<br />
<br />
Final Hints on Combat: Typically, if you get wounded at all, you're in trouble - you're making system shock rolls to avoid stuns and unconsciousness, you're taking negatives on all your rolls and movement, and even if you get healed, you're still not as good a fighter as you were at first.  Injury and Death are usually hand-in-hand on Dragaera - if you get injured, you'd better compensate quick, and it's often wise to run or teleport away if you can.<br />
<br />
Spellcasting and Psionics:   On Dragaera, the air is full enough of magical energy that you can communicate, even over great distances, with anyone you know personally.  This is called Psionic communication.  Also, skilled Sorcerers can manipulate the energy from the Imperial Orb (provided they have a link to it), and Witches can cast spells powered by the fundamental powers of the soul and the universe.<br />
<br />
Psionics:  You may only communicate psionically with someone you've met at least twice, and only if you know their name (or a name they will respond to; &quot;Hey You&quot; or &quot;The Brown-Haired Easterner I Saw In the Corner&quot; don't count).  Psionic communication typically takes a Normal Action (although you generally don't want to do it during a fight, as you're unable to defend with melee weapons while casting a spell or using psionics).  The only exception to this is psionic communication with a familiar - this is always a Free Action, and you are not defenseless while using it - indeed, usually the opposite.  Psionics are generally useless for anything other than communication, unless you possess the Advanced Psionics skill, in which case it can be used to cast spells in the same manner as Sorcery, at only half the mental fatigue cost (minimum 0 points)<br />
<br />
Sorcery:  Sorcery involves using the power of the Imperial Orb to control energy, to produce effects of various magical natures.  Sorcery is usually considered the &quot;Quick and Dirty&quot; school of magic - its effects are fast, simple, and powerful, but draining to use in quick succession.  Only those with access to the Imperial Orb or the Pre-Empire Sorcery skill can use Sorcery.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Casting a Sorcery Spell:  Casting a spell usually takes a Double Action, and involves intense concentration that leaves no room for moving, talking, or defending yourself during the casting of the spell.  If you are attacked while casting a spell, you may roll Reflex to attempt to avoid the attack, but your spell will be ruined unless you can beat the attacker's roll with your Sorcery Roll (rolling at Standard penalty).  To cast a Sorcery Spell, you must possess no fewer than 2 points of Sorcery per level of the spell you wish to cast.  To cast successfully, you must roll your Sorcery skill and succeed at a DC of 10 + double the spell's level (12 for a first-level spell, 14 for a second-level spell, 16 for a third-level spell, and so on).  To be more certain of casting a spell, you may extend your casting time by more Actions - for each Double Action you add, decrease the DC by 1 (note that you cannot cast spells above your level this way).  You may, in desperate times, attempt to cast a Sorcery spell one level too high for you (for example, trying to cast a third-level Sorcery spell with only 4 Sorcery skill) by rolling your Sorcery skill at Standard Penalty.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Saving Against Sorcery:  Most spells allow a Save, or a chance to avoid the spell's effects.  The spell's target can either make a Reflex roll or a System Shock roll, depending on the spell (sometimes both), and must beat a DC equal to 10 + the caster's Sorcery skill + the caster's intelligence modifier.<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Mental Fatigue: Casting a Sorcery spell typically hits the user with Mental Fatigue, usually at a cost of 1 point of Mental Fatigue per spell level.  Also, some spells, such as Teleport, can inflict Physical Fatigue on the spellcaster as well.<br />
