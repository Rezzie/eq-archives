Neither one really matches the traditional role of rogue that I'm acustomed tyo from 7 years of playing EQ1.<br />
<br />
Champions: No stealth ability, UNLESS they are an elf with the elf Sylvan Shadows racial trait equipped, but definitely the top melee DPS in game. They wear leather armor and dual weild from the getgo, which seems very rogue-ish, but at lvl20 they get to wear heavy armor and I never really thought of a rogue as wearing plate.<br />
<br />
Burglars: Stealth ability at lvl1, light armor to start, medium armor at lvl10. Burglars have mediocre dps compared to Champions, but they do get to steal ****. But LoTRO has them in the role of DEBUFFERS. C'mon I wanna be a rogue not a goddamn shaman hybrid.<br />
<br />
Oh yes - Hunters: F*ck rangers, ok? these guys are SERIOUSLY overpowered in LoTRO.</div></div><hr />

Um. yeah.. they're called burglars for a reason. Did you ever happen to read a book called The Hobbit? Pretty neat book. It was about this dude called Bilbo Baggins, who was a burglar. Well, actually, he was just a hobbit. But some dude named Gandalf told some dwarves that he was a burglar, and that he was quite accomplished at it, so he kind of got dragged along. He didn't do leet dps, he wasn't an assassin.. he looked around, solved a riddle or two, and.. well.. burgled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">04-22-07, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOTRO rogues are definitely the Burglars. Though I love being a PvP rogue, I've always loved the roleplay aspects of being a rogue and Burglar's definitely fit that. I'm level 10 in LOTRO right now, enjoying it, and have pre-ordered... though I don't know how long I'll keep playing. But with the Founder price I figured it was worth  playing for a little while to mix things up with my other MMORPGs.<br />
<br />
Btw, I love how one of the Burglar skills is Riddling LOL.</div></div><hr />

EQ1 turned the Rogue into an Assassin which while nice, was not everyones cup of tea. After that many games just followed suit.<br />
<br />
EQ2 the realm of &quot;Rogues&quot; went to the Swashbuckler and Brigand who both had hybrid utility value...this list could go on and on.<br />
<br />
Burglars do a good amount of DPS in LOTRO, nothing compared to a Hunter ofc, but as someone has already pointed out Hunters are plain sick for DPS.<br />
<br />
We are the class who can sniff out a hidden cache of loot (Track Treasure), can study our opponents from the shadows spotting a flaw in their defense (Reveal Weakness), can confound an enemy with riddles (aka Mez) aswell as debuffs of differing flavours. With the added use of Caltrops (AoE DoT) Stun Dust and Bags of Marbles (knockdown) the class is really flavoursome for my liking.<br />
<br />
I played a Rogue EQ1 for about 5 years, Ragebringer was the worst thing that ever happened as it turned us into a 1 trick pony, DPS. Nerf bats were continually being swung by all and sundry about Rogues and the backstab multiplier, excluding us from certain weapons because the formula couldnt handle it.<br />

Just my tuppence worth :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rilasis</div><div class="date">04-24-07, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, hunters do much more sustained dps but I beat them in burst.  Typical lvl 15 hunters that I group with can do about 150 damage before a mob they are soloing gets to them, where their dps drops off.  I can start with a crit surprise attack for 180-200, followed by a burglar's advantage for about 30-40.  I believe my melee dps beats a hunter's at that point.  Of course, they can still shoot their arrows point blank but most of their abilities can be interrupted by attacks and take longer to land.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive been sneaking around in areas that most classes couldnt even see at my level, and completing quests that Ild need a much higher level fellowship for.<br />
<br />
Always love the thrill of getting whacked if you make a wrong move, reminds of the right of passage in getting your own book from a fully popped Hate.<br />

Yes Im old skool, and proud of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">04-25-07, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to play a more traditional rogue role, then you want burgler. burglers have decent dps, probably comparable to captain or slightly better, but have great utility.  They also excel in groups, which is a first.<br />
<br />
if your used to the &quot;dps&quot; role then you want champion, or hunter. Hunters are the best dps in the game, bar none. champion are 2nd on the list, but are the best at PBAOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AaronEuth</div><div class="date">04-30-07, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Burglars are also the only class that can start conjuctions at will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiddon</div><div class="date">05-01-07, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like what they did with the burgler class, I am having a ton of fun with this game so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rilasis</div><div class="date">05-03-07, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me as well.  I recently hit 24 and this is where burglars start to rock.  I have won every spar but 1 up to this point, all against people my level or 1-2 higher.  The one I lost was against a hunter 7 levels higher than me, and I still managed to get her to half health.  Burgars appear to be overpowered, and I hope that they don't realize this and nerf them.</div></div><hr />
