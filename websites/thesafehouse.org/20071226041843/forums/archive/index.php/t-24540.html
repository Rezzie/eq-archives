Funimation has licensed FMP:TSR, the third season of Full Metal Panic. A suprising move, considering ADV had the first two seasons.<br />
<br />
On another note, I watched the FMP:TSR OVA's that was released recently, last night, and holy Tessa fanservice! It was awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I keep meaning to download the Tessa OAV...</div></div><hr />

From what I understand, ADV and Funimation frequently hire from the same studio. I would not be suprised if the voices remain the same.</div></div><hr />
