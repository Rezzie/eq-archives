<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the outset, I'll tell you, there isn't much to this rant. But it still pisses me off. I work in an office, and as office people do, they send a rube to get everyone's lunch order. That's not a biggie. <br />
<br />
When I hit a drive thru, assuming there is no one there, I'm out as fast as my food is done, and everyone behind me can progress in an orderly, timely fashion.<br />
<br />
But YOU, you stupid stank, mis-understand the use of the drive thru. It is not there so you can rest on your 220 pound post maternal ass and order food for 6 people, and two kids. It's there so things can go, quickly. I know, I know, what a trial it is to go inside to order 35 dollars of fast food. You know what is more of a trial? Sitting behind your ass for 15 minutes while you continue to look in your side view mirror to spot the lynch mob that is forming behind you. It's more of a pain in the ass to have to yell into the mic every 5 minutes to see if they even know you are there, because the attendants are too busy stocking piling your garbage bag of @#%$ food. And it surely is more of a pain in the ass when after recieving your food, you sit, in front of the window, to make sure they SI'd all 35 dollars of your food. You @#%$ bitch, MOVE IT. The world does not @#%$ stand still because of your two kids, your lunch order, and your @#%$ minivan.<br />
<br />

<br />
You've got 3 kids in there, you can't leave them in there alone for the 15 minutes or so it would take for you to go in, order the food, and carry out...<br />
<br />
Now you can either go park in the lot... get all 3 kids out of their carseats/seatbelts, try to keep them from running straight across the parking lot without looking for cars into the restaurant, keep an eye on them while you're trying to order the food, keep them from stagediving the cashier in a bid to grab the toy that the guy is placing into the kids' meal box... carry the food AND the 2 year old who has plopped himself down on the floor and refuses to walk on his own two feet back to the van... rebuckle them all into their restraints while hoping that one of them hasn't grabbed hold of the food bag and recarpeted your minivan with an explosion of french fries...<br />
<br />
(I'm not even a mom at this point, and yet, I already can see this happening in vivid detail)<br />
<br />
... or you can use the driveup, keep the rugrats in their restraints, get your food, and drive home, without all that drama.<br />
<br />
Though I do agree that you should pull out of the queue into a parking space to check to see whether or not they've included all the things you've ordered. (Back In Black)<br />

<br />
ORDER OFF THE #$%# MENU DUMB ASS!!!<br />

Order and much as you want, but if you special order something the guy in the car behind you has every right (hell, I think responsibility) to kick your ass up and down the street while they make your double whopper no pickels extra tomato mayo on the side.<br />

At least they do that here in CO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kids that can walk become your problem, not the line behind you. And what is so bloody hard about sending the adult sitting next to you inside while you mind your precious creche'? I shed no tears for people with multiple children who need special privelages to manage them. And wtf is a home mom doing ordering 6 meals from Arby's anyways!?!? Tell me you can't go inside because you have kids, and that walking them inside would be too much trouble, and I'll tell you to drown them if it is causing you that many problems.</div></div><hr />

Have you forgotten how fun it was for your mom to take you to a fast food joint and eat something that's simply greasy and horrible for you?  <br />
<br />
If it was that big of a deal for you, why didn't YOU go inside and place your order?  If you can't handle multiple orders with no one to hinder you, what makes you think a mom can do so with screaming kids?  The world doesn't stop for you just because you're some office grunt on an hourly pay time crunch sent on errands for other people.

Hell, I work with this guy from Holland, who has been in the states less than a year, and every time we and a friend would go to lunch, he'd nerviously point out that we should go inside, faster for us, faster for everyone else. A newly arrived person to this country has a better grasp courtesy than full blown citizens. <br />
<br />
edit Let me spell it out for you again Nyssa. One to two people, in a drive thru, at minute a piece. That is what it is for. Getting people in and out fast. It's like going to the grocery store, buying 40 items, and getting in the express lane. And yeah, I remember going out to eat with my mom, where she'd take us inside, let us play in the ball room, while she ordered food and we all sat down.

ROFL...I find this statement very ironic considering you sat in the drive thru line yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides which, they tend to screw up your order less inside.  Something to do with the order taker being able to hear you more clearly, and you being able to see your food as it's packed, as I understand it. Edited by: Dragynphyre at: 9/24/03 11:41 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But see, I like the drive thru. Bing, bang, bam, I'm in, I'm out, I'm mobile and I have food next to me in 2 minutes. When you are bouncing out of class and have 20 minutes to go the bank, and get food before work, you do drive thru. It's the express lane of fast food. You go inside when you don't have a million things to do, you aren't on a 20 minute lunch break, or you just want to relax and have someone smile at you instead of shove you through the line. Me? I'd rather be shoved through, I eat sooner that way. And for the record, from experience, it's rarely the guys at the register that screw it up. It's the guys in the grill that are so @#%$ slammed with orders, they put the SI sticker on a regular meal, or just miss the fact entirely you don't want onions.</div></div><hr />

Follow the Hollish guy's advice, swallow your pride and anger, AND GO INSIDE. If it's anything like it is around here, it's packed outside and calm inside. I get out, order two meals, and have them both ready to go in the time it took for the car I was going to get behind to move up 2 cars.<br />
<br />
Life doesn't work how it should work, it works how it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I should just default to waiting at the counter when 7/10 times, it's quicker to use the drive-thru, like it was intended? I can't think of a better example than taking 120 dollars to the express lane at the supermarket. It's just plain inconsiderate. I'll still use the drive-thru, because it will still be faster 7/10 times for me, and I'll probably still get mad those 3/10 times that one person makes it not fast by being a dink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pedric Cuf</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about you use common sense and realize that if there's 10 cars outside, or a big mini van packed with people, that you should go inside?</div></div><hr />

I think that defies common sense, Pedric. <br />

Just wanted to add, she was the only one in line when I pulled up. By the time I'd left, there were over 15 cars in the drive thru.  Edited by: Nenjin Darkeyes at: 9/24/03 1:16 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pedric Cuf</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. That must have taken a long time. Was there glue cementing you to the road that you couldn't have pulled out and parked into the spot not 10 feet away? Or perhaps to be fair, mebbe someone was too close behind you that you couldn't pull out? But there's ways around that, too.<br />
<br />
And I guess I should have put a warning label up that the idea of common sense wouldn't work every time, but I figured that would go without saying. You were speaking about going through the drive through EVERY time and I was saying that in extreme cases you should use your judgement to decide whether to go in or go through the line. But by your reasoning, it's either one way or the other. I guess there are no in betweens and I'm living in a fantasy world, and I guess rants aren't for seeking advice, but seeking others to agree with you. Or to just agree with yourself and refuse any advice. Edited by: Pedric Cuf at: 9/24/03 1:24 pm</div></div><hr />

As I think about it, had I pulled to up an empty drive thru with a list of @#%$ to order, my instinct would be to just whip in. I guess I learned something today.</div></div><hr />

Mmmmm....   In 'n' Out.   Not enough variety on the menu to be able to screw up any orders, much less get in special orders.  And 90% of the ones I've been to are FAST in the drive through, even with a line of 15 cars before the ordering  speaker.<br />
<br />
Yup, In 'n' Out.   Only fast food place I'll deal with for drive through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Was there glue cementing you to the road that you couldn't have pulled out and parked into the spot not 10 feet away?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, it's called &quot;cement.&quot; It forms into a suitably hard, rocky barrier that does rather nasty things to the underside of your bumper and car when you try to drive over it.<br />
<br />
Every drive through in Northern Texas is a one lane 'you're stuck here' structure. Now living north of houston, there's escape lanes, but that cannot be expected to be found everywhere in the country.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Forceofmotion1</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would seem to me, that if the sole purpose of the drive-thru was to get people in and out in X amount of time, then the restaurants would set a maximum limit on order size.  Since this is not the case, however, I think it's pretty safe to say that the true purpose of the drive-thru is convenience...someone who doesn't want to get out of his or her car (for whatever reason), doesn't have to.<br />
<br />
Just because you were in a hurry and she happened to have a big order doesn't make her any less entitled to use the drive-thru service.  Honestly, if I were in your shoes, I would've been annoyed too...but my irritation would have been aimed at the sadistic nature of Fate and Murphy's Law...not the woman minding her own business and doing something she has every right to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the more I thought about it, the more I realized it just sucks, and it was crappy of me to rail at her. On a positive note, Subway put a big sign up telling customers they wouldn't accept more than 3 orders at the drive thru. Maybe there's hope yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaielen</div><div class="date">09-25-03, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No special orders in the drive-thru?  <br />

So I'm supposed to eat something I don't like because some impatient @#%$ tard is behind me in line?  Whoever that impatient @#%$ tard is, he's not going to starve while I make sure to get no tomatos and no mayo on my burger and no ice in my coke.  <br />
<br />
If anyone behind me ever had a problem with my order, I could solve their meal problem by helping them swallow their teeth.<br />

I can't help but think how I have only 1 hour for my lunch break while this person is wasting my time because they have no consideration or understanding of &quot;the rules of the drive though&quot;. <br />

What pisses me off even more are people who place more than one order when it's their turn in the line at the drive though.<br />
