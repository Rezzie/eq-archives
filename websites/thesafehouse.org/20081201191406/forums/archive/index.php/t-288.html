 I read this after s/he posted it and figured it'd get enough congratulatory posts...but alas it received nothing til today.  I'm sorry I waited, this kind of post is underappreciated by most people. <br />

 Luckless, please post more when you get a chance.  I enjoyed your haiku very much. <br />

Haiku is an exceptional form, and if ye'd care ta listen, I'd like to say a few words about it... Although I mean not to critique the excellent story the Luckless Rogue wrote, Haiku is a bit different from what that poster made it. In particular, <br />
<br />
It is a single verse<br />
It is never 5-7-5 in English, and not always 5-7-5 in Japanese (Japanese has less information per &quot;syllable&quot;. Haiku is about minimalism, and if ye wish to adhere to a 5-7-5, you'd find that 3-5-3 would contain about the same amount of information, as 5-7-5 in Japanese). And yes, the minimalism may leave room open to interpretation. <br />
It always involves nature<br />
It contains a word that informs you what season it is<br />
Finally, yes, like the Luckless Rogue did, you may break the rules.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sebenu Sabaco</div><div class="date">02-25-01, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, the poem is very good. You are very creative to write a poem about a rouge. When reading the poem it felt like i was reading a story. It flowed very well and kept me intrested. But it is no Haiku. A Haiku should be 5-7-5, only 3 lines long. That is the traditional way to write a Haiku poem. The last two lines i did not understand how they fit into the Haiku form. Your poem is good and it is creative to brake the boundaries sometimes in writing but in respect for Haiku poets correct form is much more honorable when you say your poem is a Haiku.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Daklin</div><div class="date">02-25-01, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there really a reason to insult someone on not following a form perfectly? He expanded on the basic format of a haiku, or at least as it seems to be known in English. I doubt that any &quot;Haiku poet&quot; would be offended by this, it's beautifully written.<br />
<br />
I mean, if I wanted to I could attack you on the grammatical errors and misspellings in your post, but I'm not going to because there isn't a point. If I had written this I would be angry as hell over a comment like that.<br />
