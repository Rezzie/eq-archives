<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-09-07, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The figure was released in WonderFest 2006, and soon became very famous all over the world. The creator is Bubba, a re-intaction of her live in the famous episode 12 &quot;God Knows&quot; and &quot;Lost My Music&quot; insert songs.<br />
<br />
When it first released, one ebay auction had it's final price being over $3,000 US. Three thousand dollars!<br />
<br />
Some fine detail on this one. It's a resin statue - very different from the usual PVC or ABS. There is no mass producted verison, this figure must be custom painted. This one is no exception, it was hand painted!<br />
<br />
Not only that, her leggins, as some of you may suspect, is made out of real nylon, not painted. The strings on the guitar are real strings as well.<br />
<br />
Amusingly, my younger brother instantly recognized the guitar as a Gibson, apparently it's a famous / rare / or well known model. You can see the love put into sculpting this - the slightly open fly on the back (which spreads out and away from her body, rather than skin tight as a mass producted version would have)<br />
<br />
The bust is the same way, slightly off teh skin rather than skintight. YOu can really see her shoulder and spine definitions. Looking closely at the feet, you can see how realistically her muscles were sculpted around the ankle, as the left leg has tensed up a bit from the walking.<br />
<br />
How many of you saw her legs and thought it was a real woman's?! :)<br />
<br />
The eyes are really good, the mouth is 3D not a flat painted on or line, the leather looks glossy and leathery.<br />
<br />
You can see the fine detail on the guitar. IT's perfectly replicated. Also harder to see on the images, the suit actually wrinkles perfectly to follow the form. I.e. because she's twisting around, you can see how the suit wrinkled as a result. INcredible attention to detail.<br />
<br />
It's easily the best statue I have in my collection. I have a lot of good ones, but the sheer detail on this blows any of them out of the water.<br />
<br />
I am really happy with this!<br />
<br />
Bubba also released a Yuki figure recently, you can see the images below (I don't have it, it's the promo image)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same as above but it also shows the realistic quality of the suit she is wearing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">01-10-07, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must admit, those are really good.  High quality sculpture there.<br />
And Yes, I also admit I was struggling with the thought of 'live legs', though what made me doubt it was that the fishnet was to perfect/uniform.  Says alot of positive things for the artist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-10-07, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Bubba did an extremely well done job. But not to be forgotten is the person who actually painted and touched this figure up. Unfortunatley, I don't know his name. <br />
<br />
When he received this model, the pieces were in a very bad shape (as is normal with resin figures). Problems like bubbles in the resin, extra resin around the seams, a large seam line where it was cast, dents, gaps, and the like are the norm.<br />
<br />
He had to spend hours just touching up the resin- cutting off the extra resin, sanding down the seams and unfinished spots, adding resin in the joints (which are extremely well hidden in this figure) as often, when you try to connect for instance, the legs to the lower body, there may be as big of a 1/4&quot; gap due to not fitting properly. They need to use some kind of putty to fill that gap and adjust it to make it look natural.<br />
<br />
All this work before they even begin painting it. You need a extremely good artistic vision in order to do it. I've seen failed attempts at this figure, and many others in general, and they ended up looking so horrid i would far prefer the PVC mass manufactured versions. Especially true in the cases of recasts.<br />
<br />
He person who assembled and painted my figure had to find the perfect skin tone ot replicate it, the hair tone, properly place the eyes, make sure the fine lines of the eyebrows look natural, and so on.<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention about how most resin kits either come without joints, or very weak joints, this one is no exception, he had to add metal joints to reinforce all the points on her.<br />
<br />
All that extreme attention to detail and work to turn Bubba's Haruhi kit into something similar to the masterpiece he created. I can't honestly say that mine is equal to the one Bubba himself made, but at the very least, looking at the pictures of the one he created, it's at least 95% similar. So Bubba did a wonderful job on the sculpt, but it was the assembler and painter who brought it to life.</div></div><hr />
