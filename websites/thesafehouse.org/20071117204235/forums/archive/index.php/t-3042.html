Note, however, that Bladesingers are not the grossly overpowered characters that they were in 2nd edition.</div></div><hr />

I much prefer Spellsword (what I would consider a true fighter/mage) or Tricksers (Mage/rogue) from &quot;Tome and Blood&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">04-11-03, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the tome &amp;amp; blood bladesinger isn't too bad when you actually use the errata, since they were only half-completed in t&amp;amp;b :P pretty sad how a company like wotc can manage to release a half-completed prc.<br />
<br />
I think the races of faerun version is different as well, not sure what it's like though.<br />
<br />
another good fighter/mage variant is monte cook's eldritch master, which was in dragon magazine and reprinted in book of eldritch might 2. Edited by: Matheren at: 4/11/03 4:44:21 pm</div></div><hr />
