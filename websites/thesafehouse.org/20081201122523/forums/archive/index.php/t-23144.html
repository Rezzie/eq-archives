DDO makes Malledar feel much more &quot;roguely&quot; than in EQ.  Hopefully this turns out to be as enjoyable as it starts out.<br />
<br />
Any other Safehouse members giving this a try?  I'm on the Sarlona server, and I'd be happy to help however I can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenn</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this is the first mmo I've bothered with since I quit EQ(shortly after POP)<br />
<br />
 Short list of observations<br />
 The combat style swinging your weapon,dodging,tumbleing etc is chaotic but very fun.<br />
 Traps are creative and very cool A+.<br />
 Taverns nice in theory but messy lag fests in reality.<br />
 Better LFG system.<br />
 Being able to multiclass,triple class,pure class=more individualty in toons.<br />
 Group orientaited game however less downtime means less social interactions among players your grouping with ie less likely to make gaming friends in ddo than eq.<br />
 Well designed dungeons your not camping your dungeon crawling.<br />
<br />
 My friends talked me into this I got in cause they where so excited all and all been fun sofar.<br />
<br />
 Game is pretty much gonna live or die depending on their ability to release new content and quests at a steady rate.</div></div><hr />

I like a lot of what they did, but their UI sucks big time. I'm not really sure I want to subject myself to the organizational torture that is the way you interact with the game. :smirk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-07-06, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried it as well.  I'm not so happy with it.  Seems like NWN had a better UI.  The graphics are also worse than I expected, perhaps my graphics card is not good enough, but it reminds too much of Morrowind.  Not happy at the animations or the halfling female model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">04-07-06, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of combat animations I'm pretty unimpressed by, overall graphics are pretty nice if you can turn them up, but the gameplay is really what keeps me paying, and in the end... that's really what matters to me.</div></div><hr />
