<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">07-15-03, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I came across a pdf file of the free 3.5 conversion document that Wizards is going to be officially releasing on Friday.  They are sending out print copies to Gencon and other cons (to get rid of the excess), and will be putting the pdf up on their website for free download Friday.  Please note that unless you go to one of the large cons where it will be handed out, you will NOT be able to get a print copy, you must download the pdf file.<br />
<br />
In the meanwhile, if you'd like a sneak peak, here it is!  On Friday, once the official version is released on the webpage, I'll be changing the link so the download is on their dime, not ours.  Oh, and it's a 6meg download, so settle down for a nice sit.<br />
<br />
Edit: Changed the link to the wizards site. Edited by: Llabak Tharr at: 7/18/03 3:32 am</div></div><hr />

While updates to the classes are great (ranger and bard love inc), some of the other changes (weapon system, reliance on miniatures, some spell changes) are really going to be of questionable value.<br />
<br />
Be prepared to see 3.5 get house ruled to death.  I know I won't be touching the &quot;updated&quot; weapon system.  The old one works just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">07-16-03, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked the combination of Ambidextarity and Two-Weapon fighting into one feat. I've always been a huge fan of Two-bladed swords, I don't know why. Also, anyone know the definitive answer on weather they get 1.5 * str for damage like other weapons you hold with two hands? I know in NWN they don't, but I think they should   Otherwise it's tough to justify getting an exotic feat for a dual-weapon because, they really don't offer much advantage, ooo you can roll a d8 for offhand instead of a d6 (shortsword) big woop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I would have to say no, simply because if you look at how a double weapon works, you can never truly get all of the oomph behind it.<br />
<br />
In fact, the &quot;offhand&quot; part of the weapon might only get *.5 str bonus, as the book says they are treated exactly the same as an offhand light weapon.<br />
<br />
*shrug*  I can see it open to interpretation, but personally I would say the primary half gets normal  str bonus, the &quot;offhand&quot; gets .5 str bonus for damage.<br />
<br />
Not definitive, but my 2cp.<br />
