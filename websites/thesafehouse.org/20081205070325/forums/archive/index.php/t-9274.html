<br />
As you can tell, it was an educational time for all! Jingleheimer Joe, and your friends U. Unity, C. Caring, K. Kindness, and F. Friendship were spreading the message of good will towards all throughout Paragon!<br />

Jingleheimer Joe however, didn't want Friendship to come first, like he should...<br />

Damn funny stuff. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So many costume options, so little time.<br />
<br />
I made a Shaq toon yesterday for the hell of it.  And then while playing my Captain Ohio toon I ran into a guy who plays a Captain Iowa toon.  So many funny things.</div></div><hr />
