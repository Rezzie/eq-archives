<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durlo</div><div class="date">01-25-07, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our goal is to create a casual guild for mature adults where we can take the time to experience all aspects of the game.   We feel that there is no need to rush to end game content as it will still be there.  Instead we prefer to take our time and enjoy ourselves along the way, having fun as a guild, exploring the new world that Vanguard offers us.<br />
<br />
We are not a Hard Core or Raiding guild. Prior experience in MMO's or RPG's is not required. We do require that our members be mature, upstanding citizens of the game community.  We expect our members to treat others, both in and out of the guild, with respect.  We are opposed to harassment, rudeness, prejudice and other acts of intolerance and we will not put up with it from our members.<br />
<br />
We realize that people actually do have lives and commitments outside of the game, and that as adults with adult responsibilities, such as children, jobs, and significant others, the game will (and should) come second to real life intrusions that can, and often do, come at a moments notice. <br />
<br />
If this sounds like the kind of guild that you are looking for, and are over the age of 18 and can communicate in a mature manner (no 1337speak) than perhaps we are the guild for you.<br />
<br />
We are on the Woefeather server.<br />
<br />
