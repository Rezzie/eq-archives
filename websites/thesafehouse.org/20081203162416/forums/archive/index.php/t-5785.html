They connect at the right place to be that at least.</div></div><hr />

To be constructive to the post:<br />
<br />
I truly hope that this isn't going to be such a load on my system that it is like Kunark was at first before I majorly upgraded my vid card.  I won't buy a new computer just to play a game, tempting as it is.<br />
<br />
Looks pretty nice, but it's only one of three screenshots.  The other two seem to have much better lighting but don't impress me otherwise. Squink McPokeLevel 53 Halfling Rake<br />

Just a guess, but I'd expect the recommended config to be somewhere around a 500MHz processor and a 32Meg vid card.</div></div><hr />

Supposed to be a hybrid warrior/shaman with a 'heavy' reliance for pets. <br />
Not quite sure how this will play into current pets. May cause a rift in class balance arguments from current pet classes. Who knows. But it and 25 new zones that is more like the kunark expansion rather than velious...Breath of fresh air<br />

It was also said that it was a leather class, somewhere in one of the interviews.  I don't know about it being a shaman hybrid, it would be pretty overpowered to have a warrior/shaman hybrid along with what i'd imagine as necro-type pets.  We'll have to wait and see.  Anyone have an idea about the niche this class will have in the group?</div></div><hr />
