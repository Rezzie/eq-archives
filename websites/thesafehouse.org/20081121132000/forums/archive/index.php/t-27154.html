<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aikar</div><div class="date">12-09-06, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EDIT: to avoid confusion, Eternia WILL be a Serious GAMING guild. It will not be a casual based guilds. Casuals are welcome just for chatting purposes, and will not affect the seriousness of the guild.<br />
<br />
Eternia will not be considered &quot;END GAME&quot; guild, We are considered a serious &quot;Gaming Guild&quot;, which INCLUDES End Game, But we are going farther than End Game. We will be a guild you can experience everything in, in a mature and serious, but fun and relaxed manner.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
If you are looking for a guild that you can call a family, which is easy going, relaxed, full of humor and very good friends and not strict at all, and want to focus on all the game has to offer, then please read this post<br />
<br />
I'm aiming to start a guild on launch for mostly core players, but casuals are welcome too, and aim for us to be a popular guild on the server.<br />
<br />
Eternia will not be 'strict' when it comes to recruitment. We are not going to force you to raid 10 hours a day, we are not going to kick you for not logging in for a week. You will only be kicked if you break the rules.<br />
<br />
We will be a laid back, and happy family type guild. The leadership will consist of me and friends who come at first, and then anyone who proves their worth to the guild can possibly become a council member too.<br />
<br />
I'm wanting us to all learn the game together, party together and when the time comes, end game will be a main focus. I want the guild to be full fledged guild, enjoying all aspects the game offers.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for active English speaking players hopefully on an EST timezone play time who are mature enough to not cause problems and able to take jokes and have a good time together. I do not want anyone who is emo, drama queens or just down right retarded (ie no AOL users, ill kick you if you use AOL!)<br />
<br />
Eternia will also introduce a new points system that I developed, aimed to be fair and anti-greedy and promote a better guild enviroment. The only people who should not like this point system is selfish, greedy people, and I do not want those type of players. However I am open to suggestion for the system for fine tuning.<br />
<br />
So if you plan to play a bit and want to experience the game fully and have a guild to start with (I have 3-5 people coming to VG with me so far from other games, hopefully this # will grow by release) then please put up an application on our guild forums.<br />
<br />
The full Guild details can be found on our website<br />

I am likely going to create the guild on a PvE server. PvP can be fun but Im more of a PvE person . Especially considering this game focuses on PvE (A great thing! 50% PVP destroyed WoW)<br />
<br />
My Contact info is on the wiki/about page. Preferred AIM.<br />
<br />
Please register on the forums: http://eterniaguild.com/forums also and post your application.<br />
Please don't be afraid to apply, mostly all mature player applications will be accepted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope to get some people aboard :)</div></div><hr />
