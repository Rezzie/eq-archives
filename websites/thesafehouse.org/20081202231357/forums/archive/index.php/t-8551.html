<br />
These Ledgers and Testiments are found in Ssra. Megumi and I have only found 2.<br />
<br />
Ledger of Pain - found on The Shissar Magistrate - loc 140, 400<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Testiment of Night - found on the Shissar Assissin - loc 160, 450<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
info on the other 2 books would be most useful.<br />
The shissar Magistrate is a new mob in Ssra, and heard reports of a new named guard in the assissin area. We have killed the named by the TMs and found nothing. Also disiple Yelwinz has nothing. Edited by: Pinene  at: 5/5/03 2:43:31 pm</div></div><hr />

Only thing im unsure aboot is a report of a named Guard in the Assissin area someone saw on track. But have yet too see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vapors</div><div class="date">05-27-03, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your not finding them in ssara because the books are not in ssara. There in Acrylia, this is all tied together because the snakes were expermenting with the Vah shir and accedently turned one into a god who produced the grimlings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pinene</div><div class="date">05-27-03, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vapor, did you read my post?<br />
<br />
the Ledgers and Testiments (books) we have found so far, 2 of 4, ARE found in Ssra as i killed the mobs and looted them myself.<br />
<br />
Sure there is a book called &quot;Legend of Lies&quot; thats drops of every named in Acrylia but this is not the book we are all lookin for.<br />
<br />
The Ssra wasnt experimenting on the Val Shir... they experimented on A Val shir... A Hero/explorer. This was found out from the 2 &quot;books&quot; i posted pics of above.<br />
<br />
This Demi-god (Takhashi) didnt create the Grimlings, he found them and gave them &quot;thought&quot; and they worship him for this. This was found out from when my guild (Ring of Valor) first killed (only ones) Takhashi. Edited by: Pinene  at: 5/27/03 10:52:37 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vestrievan</div><div class="date">05-27-03, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye Pinene ive read the events you guys (RoV) <br />
did in Acrylia , but is their perchance a posibility<br />
that the revamp of acrylia introduced this new story?<br />
The story that the Ssissar did create Tak during these<br />
experiments on the Val Shir Hero?Thus Tak in the end<br />
decided to rage war over the Sshir and decided to use these<br />
grimmlings as his generals / soldiers? a thorn in my side is Vhalek the KOS Val Shir in the pit in acrylia now.... has anyone attempted to Mez or Charm him in order to speak with him or is that possible?Perhaps the new Testaments and LEdgers are a bit broken still just like the Taskmaster pouches were for a few weeks.In my personal opinion ...just pure speculation ...could the event in Acrylia now that its fully accessable be to a new section of Acrylia that isnt mapped instead of a final event in the older section?I know if this were true mobs would be on tracking right...but what if the events arent active until someone warps into the new sections....could this possibly be a Flag progression like PoP?Im just thinking of all posibilities since new revamp could mean anything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kelisk</div><div class="date">05-27-03, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's Vah Shir, not Val Shir.  And the one they experimented on was Khati Sha, former leader of the Shar Vahl beastlords.  Mix his name around and you get... Takhashi!  And if you look at his model closely, it is a cat skeleton of sorts. Very screwed up, but still, a definite cat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Megumi Sushi</div><div class="date">05-29-03, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This quest has to be broken. It would be nice if a developer could confirm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pinene</div><div class="date">05-29-03, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Ssra dont know where Takhashi is... as stated in he books. So there is no war between the Ssra and the Grimlings. Probably Takhashi has no idea of his origins. Other than wanting to war against the &quot;Vah Shir&quot; .<br />
<br />
On another note, killed a named i hadnt seen before, Guard S____, cant remeber the spelling. He was in the basement below the prime educator. Didnt drop a book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kelisk</div><div class="date">05-30-03, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is that Takhashi was &quot;programmed&quot; by the Shissar to go get rid of the Vah Shir so they'd have one less possible enemy when taking over Luclin.  Takhashi was never completed, so he did escape, but now is blindly following his &quot;programming&quot;.  The Shissar themselves are busy getting ready to move against Shadow Haven (They mined through the Deep and have agents and taskmasters digging tunnels all around SH)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pinene</div><div class="date">06-02-03, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually i doubt the shissar was planning anything against the Cats. The reasons for the testing was raw curiousity on the cats ablities/powers and to make a god which i asume the Emporer was hoping to use the info from these experiments to become a god himself.</div></div><hr />

it's not broken works just fine. you're going to need some friends to get the last book tho  ------<br />
<br />
<br />
Wanna share the outcome of this with us?<br />
I cant see this quest being worth the 4+ weeks we've already put into working on it. We've cleared ssra alot looking for the last two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pinene</div><div class="date">06-03-03, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">last book? or Books? we have found 2 of 4... u know where the 3rd and 4th are? please help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Filatal</div><div class="date">06-03-03, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't complete this, actually I'm not even working on it anymore as my time has been consumed with other things.<br />
<br />
But I thought after the first two were found and then nothing that perhaps it was only a 3 book quest.  I don't recall the Agent giving a number, and 3 slot containers don't exist.  There is no reason I can recall that it has to be four books.<br />
<br />
I also believe that the final book is a result of the IA script.  I tried the script once but never got a chance to go back ( well, did once, but the cats were just named &quot;.&quot; or something like that and didn't respond ).  Doesn't the Agent say something about finding the final answer on the remains of Khatia Shah?  That's what always led me to IA for the final piece.  But no one is publicly admitting to finishing the script that I have seen.<br />
<br />
All conjecture, but seems reasonable to me.<br />

Im in the same situation you are for the ledgers and testaments except i discarded my 4 slot combine conatainer as per not enough inventory room or bank room ...question is ...have you tried to combine just the 2x Books that have dropped? if so ....ive found that their is also 1 Guard ORDER from IA that wont combine with the other ones per the other quest ...wonder if this is needed ? im all outa options bro .<br />

<br />
As for the notes. The guy request different notes based on your level. theres a lower lvl quest and a higher lvl one. The High lvl one only uses 2 notes from IA and the lower lvl quest requires 3 notes which are found outside and of them are found inside too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pinene</div><div class="date">06-09-03, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no im not sure they arent in Inner Acrylia. Im just more inclined to think they are in Ssra, since thats where the experments took place and these are the Shissars records of the events.<br />
<br />
And the book in Acrylia that drops from the named spawns is called the Legend of Lies. Its used to start the quest (sort of, you dont actually need that book to get the bag from the cat, just need to say a certain line which i cant remember)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_curva2</div><div class="date">06-10-03, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what about if the book drop off shissars but NOT in ssra ? The grey has some shissar named , and i think there is a couple of shissars named in other luclin zones ( like tasmaster in eco ) .<br />
<br />
Did u tried to combine the book of lies with the other 2 books ? the vahsir give it back to you .</div></div><hr />

One question, when I went to check on the Agent at that loc, he was not there.  Definately looked like something would spawn there, but just a buncha grimlings guarding the area.  How often is his spawn time?</div></div><hr />

Here is my log from the turn in:<br />
<br />
&gt; You say, 'Hail, Agent Tiesh'<br />
<br />
&gt; &gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:46:24 2003] Banais says, 'what dark<br />
&gt; depths'<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:46:24 2003] Agent Tiesh says 'There<br />
&gt; is a legend of a Vah Shir named Khati Sha.  He was one of<br />
&gt; my people's first great heroes.  An explorer and leader, he mysteriously disappeared long ago.  I have the unsettling feeling that this war will uncover the [secret] of his disappearance.'<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:46:36 2003] You say, 'what secret'<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:46:36 2003] Agent Tiesh says 'I<br />
&gt; believe that Khati Sha is somehow wrapped up in the past and present of the Grimlings.  There are tales of a 'Legend of Lies' amongst the common Grimlings. . .a secret history kept by their elite.  If you are willing to help, go into the deep caverns and search out this text.  If we can find it, we may be able to unravel the truth of the Grimling past.'<br />
<br />
<br />
Turned in the 'Legends of Lies' <br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:47:16 2003] Agent Tiesh says 'This is<br />
&gt; disturbing.  Is there no corner of place or time that<br />
&gt; the Shissar have not tainted?  I must know more. <br />
&gt; The Vah Shir people must know the truth of their [hero].'<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:47:17 2003] Beckah saved.<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:47:24 2003] You say, 'what hero'<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:47:25 2003] Agent Tiesh says 'I must<br />
&gt; try and collate this legend with the rest of the<br />
&gt; information.  I must ask you an enormous favor. <br />
&gt; Will you go and search for more information?  I can give<br />
&gt; you no better direction but to hunt the snake men. <br />
&gt; The text tells of 'ledgers and testaments' . . . perhaps the Shissar have some record of the event.<br />
<br />
&gt; Take this [summary scroll].'<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:47:31 2003] You say, 'what summary<br />
&gt; scroll'<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:47:31 2003] Agent Tiesh says 'It has<br />
&gt; a magic on it that will encode any text put into it, hiding meaning in confusion.  See if you can track down the answers we need.  Return to me when you have sealed the scroll, when you've found all the answers you can.  I fear, however, that the final answer may only be found when we find Khati Sha himself . . .or whatever remains of him.'<br />
<br />
He then gives you a four slot container as well as giving back the 'Legends of Lies'.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:48:11 2003] You have fashioned the<br />
&gt; items together to create something new!<br />
<br />
<br />
In the container combine the 'Legends of Lies', 'Ledger of Pain', 'Testiment of Night', and the 'Mnemonic of Khati Sha'.<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:48:11 2003] You have fashioned the<br />
&gt; items together to create something new!<br />
<br />
This will make the 'Sealed Summary Scroll'.<br />
<br />
Turn the 'Sealed Summary Scroll' into him to review the reward.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:49:03 2003] Agent Tiesh says 'Truly<br />
&gt; incredible, Beckah.  I only wish that this was just a legend.  The war pales in comparison to this treachery.  There is too much truth here, too much danger.  I fear I've made Luclin an unsafe place for you now.  Here, take this as some small consolation. And know you will always have one stalwart ally to call.  Good luck'<br />
<br />
&gt; [Sat Jul 19 14:49:03 2003] Your faction standing with VahShir Crusaders got better.<br />
<br />
The end reward is the 'Fused Mnemonic of Khati Sha' listed above.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_beckah</div><div class="date">07-21-03, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as stated by someone I am apart of da/eie. We had around 65 people there mainly in elemental gear. I was the WS so I was dead and missed most of the fight but pretty much everyone was saying we could have done with less.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the numbers needed would depend on the gear and classes there.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do have some screenshots from the book but will not be able to post them until my husband rebuilds his webserver.   I hope that will be this weekend.</div></div><hr />

I'm interested and eager to read them through, and get started on the quest  <br />
<br />
Personally, I havn't been in SSRA all that often, and aren't familiar with where Assassin camp is, nor any other camp.  <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

The MAGISTARTE can be found going straight from the zone through the door past the 4 snakes in their alcoves. At the T-intersection turn right und follow the hall which ends at a door to your left. Behind it is a 3-spawn of snakes, the magistrate will always appear at the middle spawn; it does have PHs. Seen him there 4x, never at another spot.<br />
<br />
The ASSASSIN can be found when turning left at the T-intersection, going straight until you you reach two doors, the 1st to your right und 2nd one a bit down the hall to your left. Take the left door, you'll see another 3-spawn of snakes, behind them is a stone which covers an entrance, you have to pick that door/stone. Follow the tunnel (there's a trap right there a few feet down the tunnel) until you reach a pretty big room, filled with snakes.<br />
If you look into the room from the door you just walked through, you'll see a small ramp going down to the lower floor und another ramp at the far side of the room. The assassin will spawn to the left of that ramp at the far side of the room (south I believe). Never seen him spawn anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Hope that was of some help to you. Edited by: Pieksy Kenderkin at: 10/26/03 11:57 pm</div></div><hr />
