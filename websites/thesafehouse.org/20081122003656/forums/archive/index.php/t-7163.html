The other night I was charm killin in PoS and noticed that charm broke faster on Charmed pets.  Then I noticed that I had Guard of driz on (because I was soloin caster Giants).  So I took it off and charm lasted for max 3 times in a row.  Was this chance or did the pet get my MR like summoned ones do and break charm early because of this? <br />
thanks for clearing this up.. Edited by: Melodie Songbird at: 3/8/03 9:43:52 am</div></div><hr />

I normally have about 230ish MR and 100+ all other resists when I charm solo, and my pet still gets hit by pretty much everything that's casted on it.<br />
<br />
I actually count on it, and like it when my pet gets snared by mobs</div></div><hr />
