<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dragoonkain Of Hayl</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly looking for confirmation about one or two things before I start throwing points around. At the moment this is how it stands:<br />
<br />
39 Stealth<br />
41 Thrust<br />
50 CS<br />
39 Env<br />
5 DW (9 with points from autotraining to 32)<br />
<br />
Autotrain to 32 so 35 extra points to boost DW<br />
<br />
I read on a post here that with 2 Frenzied Thrusters and a Virulent Fishing Hook and RR3 you can get max Env and apply poisons to the 2h slot. Mostly looking for confirmation of that as it will save a LOT of points.<br />
<br />
CS at 50 because I heard that going over 50 still adds to max PA dmg. <br />
<br />
Also, does having Thrust at 41 make sense? The only other alternative is to bump up DW and leave thrust at 39 or 40...again, if dmg range tightens up even past full spec that would help. With 39 Thrust DW could potentially be 15.<br />
<br />
Just looking for opinions mostly, I think I'm aiming for an infiltrator with a lot of one shot kill opportunities(hence the CS), but want to check with some high lvl infs and double check the rumors I hear about certain skills. Thanks.<br />

I love dual weild especially when buffed with a damage add.  Plus, when you are high level with 2 proccing featherlites you will proc lots more with high dw.<br />
<br />
with 44 CS you get to 50 CS in albion with JODB and bounder fur glves and rr2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reworked it's<br />
<br />
39 Stealth<br />
40 Thrust<br />
44 CS<br />
39 Env<br />
25 DW<br />
<br />
All depends on the TFrenzy theory, but looks good.</div></div><hr />
