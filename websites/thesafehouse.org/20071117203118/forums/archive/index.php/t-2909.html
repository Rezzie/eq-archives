<br />
I've never had the chance to actually play P&amp;P games, but the inner geek in me still appreciates the &quot;Horrible gaming session gone wrong&quot; tales.<br />
<br />
Or ones like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;'Word of warning - Wild mages can seriously damage your elf (Paritcularly the Kender variety!). In a middle of a major scirmish between a low/medium party of level 4-7 and large party of goblins with their shaman entourage the kender got bored. Finally the goblins fleed and the kender wildmage though he'd try a wild surge for a lightning bolt to kill the fleeing head shaman. Using a modified wild surge table the role resulted in ....... x100 effect! The ensuing 2700 lightning bolt bolt killed the shaman, created a road to the far away village (through the forest), just avoided starting a forest fire and then carried on to hit the town the party was protecting. The following debate led to the creation of Shrugging proficiency!!!'&quot; &lt;u&gt;Pren, Human Master&lt;/u&gt; on The Tribunal Server<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">03-01-02, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Head of Vecna<br />
Mark Steuer &amp;lt;steuerm@nichols.com&gt;, who has the office next-door to mine, recounts this tale: <br />
Many years ago (back when we all were still playing D &amp;amp; D), I ran a game where I pitted two groups against each other. <br />
Several members of Group One came up with the idea of luring Group Two into a trap. You remember the Hand of Vecna and the Eye of Vecna that were artifacts in the old D&amp;amp;D world where if you cut off your hand (or your eye) and replaced it with the Hand of Vecna (or the Eye) you'd get new awesome powers? Well, Group One thought up The Head of Vecna. <br />
<br />
Group One spread rumors all over the countryside (even paying Bards to spread the word about this artifact rumored to exist nearby). They even went so far as to get a real head and place it under some weak traps to help with the illusion. Unfortunately, they forgot to let ALL the members of their group in on the secret plan (I suspect it was because they didn't want the Druid to get caught and tell the enemy about this trap of theirs, or maybe because they didn't want him messing with things). <br />
<br />
The Druid in group One heard about this new artifact and went off in search of it himself (I believe to help prove himself to the party members...) Well, after much trial and tribulation, he found it; deactivated (or set off) all the traps; and took his &quot;prize&quot; off into the woods for examination. He discovered that it did not radiate magic (a well known trait of artifacts) and smiled gleefully. <br />
<br />
I wasn't really worried since he was alone and I knew that there was no way he could CUT HIS OWN HEAD OFF. Alas I was mistaken as the Druid promptly summoned some carnivorous apes and instructed them to use his own scimitar and cut his head off (and of course quickly replacing it with the Head of Vecna...) <br />
<br />
Some time later, Group one decided to find the Druid and to check on the trap. They found the headless body (and the two heads) and realized that they had erred in their plan (besides laughing at the character who had played the Druid)...The Head of Vecna still had BOTH eyes! They corrected this mistake and reset their traps and the Head for it's real intended victims... <br />
<br />
Group Two, by this time, had heard of the powerful artifact and decided that it bore investigating since, if true, they could use it to destroy Group One. After much trial and tribulation, they found the resting place of The Head of Vecna! The were particularly impressed with the cunning traps surrounding the site (one almost missed his save against the weakest poison known to man). They recovered the Head and made off to a safe area. <br />
<br />
Group Two actually CAME TO BLOWS (several rounds of fighting) against each other argueing over WHO WOULD GET THEIR HEAD CUT OFF! Several greedy players had to be hurt and restrained before it was decided who would be the recipient of the great powers bestowed by the Head... The magician was selected and one of them promptly cut his head off. As the player was lifting The Head of Vecna to emplace it on it's new body, another argument broke out and they spent several minutes shouting and yelling. Then, finally, they put the Head onto the character. <br />
<br />
Well, of course, the Head simply fell off the lifeless body. All members of Group Two began yelling and screaming at each other (and at me) and then, on their own, decided that they had let too much time pass between cutting off the head of a hopeful recipient and put the Head of Vecna onto the body. <br />
<br />
SO THEY DID IT AGAIN!... [killing another PC] <br />
<br />
In closing, it should be said that I never even cracked a smile as all this was going on. After the second PC was slaughtered, I had to give in (my side was hurting)... <br />
<br />
And Group Two blamed ME [Mark] for all of that... <br />
