Anytime I die in the tundra, I keep my mouth shut and plot my revenge or the ole L&amp;S.  However it seems every other person who slips, falls and die's on my dagger has to spend 3 minutes telling me that.<br />
I just finished killing a bear and was medding.  I was on my way to town to refresh my scooby snacks.  I have a high lvl that is gonna make your guild pay. Or the worst possible thing to hear,<br />

I go, this is a PvP server, we're all PKers whether we like it or not!

You'll not ruin mine!&quot;. Followed by, &quot;Now, loot yer corpse and leave the zone.&quot; <br />

Modified for shouted insults, &quot;Don't want to get hit when (situation), then don't let me find you when (situation).  Now, loot yer corpse and leave the zone.&quot;<br />

Added when appropriate, &quot;btw, thanks for the (loot).&quot;<br />
<br />
Generally, don't respond to anything after that unless it is directed at the guild.  Silence, before another attack is more frusrating to them.<br />
<br />
When, I'm the one takin the dirt nap, I won't say anything, other than letting the zone know that I am LnSing, unless it was a good fight and I'm telling them so.

<br />
I long for true pvp combat, where killing others is intended without (well obviouslt with exceptions like the above) getting branded a a PK'er. My guild is anti-pk, as pk'ing seems to be getting frowned on more and more (I take that back, ganking is more correct). Don't get me wrong, I like being the good-guy, you know, revenge on the newbie etc etc, but I do long for some roleplaying pvp.<br />

Probably a Shank of course :) Or heck a hummie type anyway so you guys don't hunt me down =)<br />

<br />
Anyway, back on topic.  I have 1 reason to explain this phenomenon.<br />
<br />
Standard recation of a blueblie player.  In otherwords, those that come from blue servers that either:<br />
<br />
a) Think that they will have it easier because of low server population<br />
<br />
b) Think its like Rallos without item loot (where it is looked down on to engage in PvP with somone, aka the Gankers)<br />
<br />
c) Are coming from blue servers to &quot;try PvP&quot;.  Yet for some reason think that every PvP encounter should be a one on one, totaly prepared, &quot;Ok sir, I'm ready to fight now&quot; duel.<br />
<br />
d) Have no concept of team PvP and roleplaying.<br />

Dat dat dats, what I tink!</div></div><hr />

<br />
To keep my faction up so I could remain there to level, I would beat people until they got knocked out.<br />
<br />
Then I would taunt them and such.  One poor druid, he got up 4 times and each time he got up I knocked him back on the ground with a throwing weapon.<br />
<br />
I was laughing my ass off.<br />
<br />
5 minutes later, the guy is talking smack in OOC saying I suck as pk'ing and such.  I did this to zabout 4 halfonuttins and they are all saying I suck.  They just ignore the fact that I had them on the ground squezzing out a last breath with my knife at their throat.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have had more fun beating a person to the last silver of health instead of outright killing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cylant</div><div class="date">12-16-00, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the only time i've ever replied after a killing was.....<br />
<br />
i zoned out of unrest wearing my brand new BI crown.. due to a bug somehow i ended up in dragnor's cauldren... but at the butcher block zone, not unrest.<br />
<br />
I see someone start casting a spell.. i see myself fall over.... i see the kelethin bank.<br />
<br />
i sent him a tell saying ''scuse me madam.. but i was wondering, did that make you feel big or strong at all?'<br />
<br />
most of the time i just get my stuff... do a /note saying their guild, name, place and date that it happend... then leave the area<br />
<br />
when i kill people i usually get &quot;dood i'm going to report you for ____&quot; *or* &quot;dood your mom is a &amp;lt;worthless insult&gt;!&quot; *or* &quot;dood where are you.. you now have 10 guilds on your arse&quot;... &quot;thats a violation of GM code 634384 because you killed me at 5 past the hour, the very well known safe time where nobody is allowed to be killed. reported.&quot;<br />
<br />
*or*..<br />
<br />
in the case of darkenbane members...<br />
i get five or six gnome casters running at me doing their jboots and throwing fireballs at me (thats where i start running away)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
when dealing with casters, i often find it best to just keep them on the ground for 10 minutes or so by throwing items at them every time they get up, then leaving them there to stand up on their own time.. funny to see what they do after standing up <br />

I PK in oasis a lot and I've slaughtered many a afk medding DE caster, they will bitch to no end.  Going AFK solo in an open area is just plain stupid, you deserve to die..... Take yer deaths with a little dignity, of the times I've been just plain owned I never begged....although I did freak out (ooc though, just getting the rest of the zone to tell em to at least let me bind first, jackass) I just ported to gfay and was swarmed in 10 sec as my porter (and binder) were still zoning.....grrrrrrr</div></div><hr />

<br />
This crap is fuggin funny. <br />
<br />
What i hate is when you're about to wax a yellow or red con caster and they get OOR or inv healed, they commence to /ooc or /shout to the zone on how they &quot;owned you&quot;<br />
<br />
One caster that did this was sending rude tells as well. All i replied was: &quot;Watch your back, the dagger that strikes unseen is the most deadly...&quot;<br />

Then the next day guess who i find lom and under a bubble of health all alone.<br />

No biggie if they don't answer.  I've had people send me tells after killing me, and that gets pretty tedious.  Usually it's something along the lines of... &quot;how'd you do that cool thing?&quot;  (Cool thing being something like poison, /hide, etc...).  Like I'm going to tell them... jeesh.</div></div><hr />

I also love it when they say they are gonna get me banned...oh no not that anything but that please? I TRIED to get banned once and couldnt do it wtf makes you think your stupid threat is anything more than amuseing?<br />
to the rest who bitch I tell em to go back to their carebear server. of course that usually pisses them off to no end   Diabalein Avidya <br />
