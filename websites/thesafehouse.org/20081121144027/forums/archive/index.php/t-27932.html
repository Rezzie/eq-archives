<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vaedar</div><div class="date">01-25-07, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ronin is a new guild created by several oldschool Everquest players who were key members in a top raiding guild for 5 years.  We founded Ronin for mature Vanguard players who, like us, just don't feel like they've found the right guild.  Personally, I don't think one can find it in a charter or website; it has to be experienced.  Now, I suppose I could go on about how cool Ronin is and all the great things we're going to accomplish.  Maybe you're looking to read about our super revolutionary guild structure or how we're going to raid but, oh, we will accept casual players, too.  And, oh yea, this guild has a purpose etc etc.  <br />
<br />
Truth is, we don't give a damn about any of that...yet.<br />
<br />
Right now we're focused on the one thing that makes a guild great: people.  That's right, we just want to find cool people who enjoy playing Vanguard as much and as often as we do.  We can sort out the details as we go.<br />
<br />
Those interested will find our charter and application process here:  http://www.theronin.org/forum.<br />
<br />
Wherever you end up, make sure it's where you belong.<br />
