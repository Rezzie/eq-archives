<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, a trap meant to put the entire party into the lair of a Merelith Demon was in the game I ran tonight.  Basically, there was a cursed book that, if opened, would teleport anyone within 10' of the book to the Merelith's lair.  The Merelith is in her lair expecting the party (and setting up traps of various types) because she just SOLD them the book for an enormous sum of gold.<br />
<br />
Problem.  The party wizard opened the book when the part was seperated (foolish thing to do; even though he was told it was safe, you STILL take precautions!)  So, now, instead of a very difficult battle for the full party of 7 individuals, I'm facing a slaughter of only 3 of them in the lair.  Warrior and cleric?  Not there.  2 mages and a Rogue are fighting an AC 29, SR 25 demon.<br />
<br />
So, the question is, do I let nature take it's course and have the demon eat half the party, or do I replace the demon with an Illusionist trying to scare the party?  The later feels like a cop out...but the battle would be like a cat playing with a mouse.  No challenge at all for the Merelith.<br />
<br />
Anyway, anyone have any other suggestions for me?  I have until Tuesday to come up with some interesting twist or another that is still a challenge, but not a cop out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TBH, this depends on the style of play you use for your games/party.<br />
<br />
Do characters rarely/never die in your campaign? Then use the illusionist.<br />
Do chars die sometimes/regulary? Then have them face the consequences of their actions and let them fight the demon.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
You could have them fight the real demon, but the demon realises they are no match for him and just plays around with them like a cat with a mouse- maybe cages them up and waits for the rest of the group to show up? Sure, playing with a split-up group sucks, but sometimes you can't change it. Marauder ShadowCross Bladesong<br />

Kill them? but if they're good aligned that just means they'll go to the upper planes. Corrupt them? Much better! Not only will they be fighting your corner in life, but their souls will be yours come death! Score.<br />
<br />
Place them in a situation that looks hopeless... and then see what they are prepared to offer to get out. As immortals, Demons can afford to take the long view...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In addition to the good advice above I'd also sugest basing it off of how warned they were about opening the book alone. If they had no reason to think it would become a problem, guide them on a less lethal route, until the party finds their way back together. If they were expressly aware that it could be a very dangerous stunt, don't go easy on them, or if you do, let them know it's a one time leniency and not to be expected in the future. Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or perhaps butcher the character, and then let the Demon taunt the other characters with the bodies of their fallen comrades.<br />
<br />
The characters get the dead folks raised, but make sure you take the level away from them and perhaps one or two choice magic items they had on their person that the demon may care to keep as a bauble (and perhaps use against the PCs later).  <br />
<br />
The players learn that stupidity is a bad thing, but the overall campaign, character backstory, and flow of the current adventure isn't damaged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you also don't want to make them think that they have got to follow your plan to the letter. Just make sure it doesn't come off as a smackdown because they didn't do what you thought they would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sillis Spineslicer</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to be devious, have the demon use a &quot;lost arcane ritual&quot; that allows it to threaten the very souls of the characters if they do not do what it wants.  Then you can set up the three who were ported in as minifoils versus the rest of the party.  The demon will have an incredible inside source, and you will have a new hook.<br />
<br />
The three can't tell the rest of the party, but when they act strange (I need to step out to um, powder my nose.  Hello, Ms. Boss Demon?  Here's what is going on...), the rest of the party gets worried.<br />
<br />
When the local church detects a demonic scrying link, follows it to the characters and tries to purge the evil...  All kinds of devious goodness.<br />
<br />
Of course, you would have to set a pretty tight limit on what could cause the demon to snuff them out.  Their goal is to figure out how to get out from under it and extract revenge.  That alone could take months or more real time to play out depending on how mean you are  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have the Demon capture the 3 party members, and torture them! Insert a method by which, maybe a dream or something, that the rest of the party becomes some what aware of the other's plight. Rest of the party enters, start dramatic battle music, and offer the captured PCs an option to escape on their own(with 1/2 hps) to join the battle, or make the rescuing PCs have to break out the others, like they are chained up, caught in spider webs, something to that effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rorne</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go with the lost ritual idea, but claim that it requires 7 people for some part of it (sacrifices?   ). The Merelith would be somewhat angered with the wizard (toture!) foolishly spoiling his plan of capturing them all at the same time. He plants the book in a place the remaining 4 will see it, baiting them into reading it in an attempt at finding clues as to what happened to the others. They pick it up, read it, and presto. Problem solved. (That is, unless the warrior reads it alone, bwahaha)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Players die on occassion in this campaign, but it's not an everyday happening.<br />
<br />
Basic story in a nutshell:  The Merelith basicly runs a town on an island frequented by pirates.  It's a safe port and a free city where anything and everything can be found for a price.  There is one bookseller.  Since most of the pirates cannot read, they tend to sell books and scrolls they capture as booty to the bookseller.  This bookseller happens to be one of the Mereliths 3 &quot;forms&quot; (Polymorph self is so handy!)  <br />
<br />
The major temple in town is dedicated to Istishia, an evil goddess of the sea.  The priests, while aware of the Merelith, are for the most part unconcerned about the fact that she, in all but name, runs the town.  The Merelith has a long standing deal with the temple, and the two evil factions get along modestly well.  Tention at times, but...both sides are prospering and there is little need to fight over an abundance.<br />
<br />
Now, the only thing the Merelith is worried about are powerful priests or wizard who are not allied with her.  So, she sets up an identiday as the bookseller, figuring most magic types eventually needs scrolls, spellbooks and such.  Minor spellworkers, she is not concerned over, but those who have true power (such as the PCs) she uses the book to lure into a trap where she can quickly eliminate them as a threat.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions so far!  A couple ideas I can play with here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-04-03, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that worked out nicely you ended up with the Mages getting captured! From the demon's perspective, that couldn't have worked out better. Now, does she want to kill the mages, recruit them, corrupt them, or grill them for information? Possibly, there is another forgotten ritual where, through the use of a host, Merelith can take a mortal form(not sure what advantage this would give her..), and she neesd the mages to complete the ceremony. Say, the spell requires a magic user of opposed alignment to inhabit. Let her disregard the rogue(bad idea) because he/she isn't nessecary, and she can't be bothered with screwing around torturing someone. Rogue can(stress can)  escape and inform the rest of the party.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">06-10-03, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem wasn't the fact that is was a fireball, but rather the fact that they interupted her soliloquy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vilkata Tasavalt</div><div class="date">06-24-03, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate the idea of punishing the party for something one character does.  I mean, if the rogue and other wizard were telling the wizard not to open the book, why should they get slaughtered for his stupidity?<br />
<br />
But that's just my own opinion, and of course may have no bearing on your game.  I've just seen too many stupid characters get everyone else killed because of their sheer idiocy.  I hate that.<br />
