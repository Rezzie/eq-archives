<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baulkin</div><div class="date">12-11-04, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following guide is on how to make a successful Dark Elf Swashbuckler...by a Dark elf Swashbuckler.  I suppose it applies to other classes but this is a rogue forum.  I've seen alot of people get stuck in this quest so here we go...<br />
<br />
Obviously, you are going to start in the Isle of refuge <br />
Your objective here is NOT to get off the island as fast as you can.  There are a few items you will want to pick up before you leave.  The named Shark drops a dirk, and the named Serpent drops a dagger.  You'll need these unless your heavy into tradeskilling and make yourself some tin daggers.  Me personally...I duel wield, I know it works so I suggest it to you.  You'll also want to do your armor quests (dont bother with the weapon quest, you'll be duel wielding).  While your there kill the supply captain or the siege planner and get a 6 slot bag, unless your a heavy tradeskiller, you'll be using that bag for a while.  Your going to need to do a little farming here, so roll up your sleeves and farm some cash to fill your non visual armor slots with laborer's armor from the merchant...Or make it yourself if your a tradeskiller.  Once all thsi is done we can head to freeport.  Here's a checklist of objectives on the island.<br />
**Suggested**<br />
[ ] Attain Level 6 <br />
[ ] Attain two duel wield weapons<br />
[ ] Fill armor slots (this does not include rings, earrings ect)<br />
[ ] Attain 6 slot dropped bag<br />
**Optional but useful**<br />
[ ] Gathering, Trapping, Foresting, Mining, Fishing skill at 20<br />
[ ] Max Experience at 220%<br />
<br />
Next Step is Freeport Part 1 Citizenship, Class quest.<br />
First things first, complete your citizen quest.  Tip...If your xp is already maxed, just kill the rats at the zone in of the zone for the quest...why risk xp debt for no reason?  finish the quest.  (If you need guides to any of these quests let me know, but im not going to put up 30 pages of quest spoilers for people who already know the quests and dont wanna read all day.) Head down to the thieves way, and solo down there until level 8...should be easy, if you get in trouble just zone...xp debt isn't worth the hassle at this level.  At level 8 head to North freeport, and go into the Jade Tiger inn.  Talk to the emmesary in there and she will give you the quest to become a Rogue.  (Please note that she gives you options at the end, obviously pick rogue).  Once your done running errands for the bat she will send you to steal information on a merchant that she thinks is ripping off the city.  I wont spoil it for you unless asked but...turn up your speakers for this...and use your head, it's no trick.  Once you complete the quest you'll recieve a bp you can't wear until lvl 10 and a ring you can put on now.  Your &quot;probably&quot; level 9 by now, but if not, no biggie.<br />
<br />
And then... Phase 2 freeport.<br />
This phase is a gear up phase.  You are about to complete one of the hardest quests in the game, and alot of it you are going to do all alone.  So wearing those gray con pants, or those green con gloves isn't going to cut it.  Complete every quest you can find, before you begin betrayal you should have no piece of gear that isn't at least conning blue to you.  I'll throw some quest names on the checklist at the end of this phase.  You should level all the way to lvl 10 during this phase, and you should have a few pieces of gear you can't even equip yet.  I dont state it, but throughout this entire quest, until you get to antonica ...quest all you can, because you are going to need it.  <br />
<br />
Quest &quot;Must do&quot; Checklist<br />
[ ] Temple of War quest (bracer of the willing)<br />
[ ] Pythus Quest ( Last Chance ..Decent rapier)<br />
[ ] Thexian Artifacts (starts in longshadow alley)<br />
[ ] Key to fallen gate (If you ever want to do zombie mastery)<br />
<br />
Next Phase... Commonlands (lvl 10-14)<br />
Along with whatever quests you pick up along the way in Commonlands this is where you should xp from 10-14.  There is a quest npc at the west freeport gate that wants you to do various yard tasks for him.  Ie kill 6 beetles, ect.  Do this quest, repeatidly.  It's easy, the mobs are xp, and the quest completion is xp.  Rinse repeat this quest if you get stuck with xp in these levels.  Otherwise you can try to get groups at Tormoil Cemetary.  Also get groups to get the fallen gate key, it involves killing giants, but the reward for completing the quest is very good. At 13/14 you can start to solo the hounds, they are decent xp.<br />
<br />
Final Xp Burst phase (lvl 14-16)<br />
Head over to wailing caves, if you've been working on experience in antonica you should have enough fsr's to choke a small child. Also be sure to talk to gimble, he's a little gnome that walks along the road, he'll give you a quest that you can complete while xping in wailing, you'll want the boots reward btw.  You should pick up a few decent items while experiencing here if you get decent groups and the xp is good.  Once your level 16 we can Offically Start the Betrayal Quest.<br />
<br />
Betrayal Quest Part 1<br />
Head over to the statue of Lucin Delere in East freeport.  Take a moment to look at that statue, then look over his shoulder.  Behind his back is a building.  It's the Newspaper the Freeport Observer.  Walk on in, and walk up the stairs.  There you'll find Stilus.  Talk to him and he will begin your quest for redemption.  The first stop? Your appartment, relinquish it now.<br />
Next stop? If you dont have bags filling your inventory do it now.  Next<br />
Stop Serpent sewers (entrance is in the Thieves way).   Kenjedeau is the qeynos resistance leader in the serpent sewer.  There is no polite way to say this, load up a map on the net, map out how to get to him in your mind, then train like a bard on a pvp server. The mobs see through your sneak, and will own you, so just run.  There is a guard near Kenjedeau and he will kill all the mobs still chasing you.  After talking to Kenjeadeu you will be transported into an instance.  Inside this instance is 3 mobs.  2 of them are linked, and a boss is seperate.  Go ahead and sit down and get all your health back, eat some food.  Pop Street Smarts then pull the one in front of you.  He's linked with another.  You should defeat them both easily (I'll include a combat guide at the end of this if I remember).  Go ahead and sit down, regen all the way, and when you are ready kill Bonebreaker.  After he's dead, take off all your gear and put it into your bags.  Trust me on this.  Click on the door.  I will not tell you what happens inside this door, because it is one of the best experiences ive had in EQ2 thus far.  And So,  we fast forward to after that room. <br />
<br />
 Phase -  - - Raise the Dead..dont worry you get it back in 72 hours....<br />
<br />
Tormoil Cemetary as soon as you spawn hail the Executioner and zoom through the text, dont even read it, when its done, run like all hell because you probably have skeleton agro.  Just run them off because the guards wont help you.  Now scroll up and read what he said, he tells you that you must get to the Port of Naythex.  And to meet his friend vishra in antonica.<br />
Now he &quot;tells you&quot; that you should run to the docks and catch a boat there.  I did this, and for the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to make it work...sooo if your like me you get to do the next part.  If you figure it out how to make it work, please post here...I might wanna run an alt through betrayal.  If your like me, run to the Griffin Tower near the docks, and take the griffin to nektolos station.  Once there, run to the nektolos zone, and zone in.  Your objective here is to train, train like you never have before in your life.  If you can get sow, get it, if not pathfinding works.  From the Zone in, run straight across the bridge, you are going to stay on the path (moving slightly to the right or the left to avoid possible agro, but dont go out of your way, because mobs will be chasing you.).  Stay LEFT on the path, eventually you will come to a broken bridge, go across that bridge, once again, stay left.  If you continue left eventually you will find yourself on the beach.  You should See the port of Naythex along the water..  run straight up the docks, keep running straight down them.  On the left side you will see a bell.  Ring it, and you'll be zoning to Thundering Steppes.  Compared to Nektolos Forest, thundering steppes is a playground with bunnies in it.  Go straight out from the docks and onto the path (dont go into the river bed). Follow the path until the crossroads, then turn to the right, follow the path straight all the way to antonica. <br />
<br />
      - - - Vishra - - -<br />
Once in antonica, go down the path, then make a left turn.  Continue to follow the wall until you come to a tent with vishra and a dwarf.  Talk to vishra and you will recieve the next step in the quest.  Warning, in no part in this quest should be be coy or you will pay a price for it.  He tells you that you need to do the following.  <br />
[ ] Kill 500 gnolls<br />
[ ] Kill Cruglybar &amp;amp; Natglass (Inside Blackburrow)<br />
[ ] Kill Dancord of the Pine, Towyn the Lazy, Sarn the Wayfarer in antoica.<br />
<br />
Step 1 of Vishra's massively anoying quest.  <br />
<br />
Head to blackburrow, basicly carefully continue to follow the wall with it on your left until you come to blackburrow.  Go ahead and zone in.  If you didn't know until you complete this quest, your level is capped at 17.  Go ahead and go lfg here.  Your going to want to go ahead and get that level.  you aren't leaving blackburrow until Cruglybar and Natglass are dead, your 17, and you've made some friends.  If your a jerk or an antisocial, your sol with this strategy...so erm...I dunno.  Once you've completed these goals you should be ready for the next step.  My guess is you've killed about 300 gnolls, gotten some gear, made a friend or two,  and got your 2 mobs dead...along with your level.  Now ask your newly found friends, probably the next day, or if your bold that night.  To help you kill the other 3 named gnolls.  It will probably just be 3 or 4 people.  So pick up some evil people who are in antonica.  Most of the time they are either working on the same quest as you...or they are done with it and can sympathize.  All the mobs are a 1 hour spawn, but are rarely killed.<br />
Dancord is easy to find, walk straight out from blackburrow and into the woods.  He spawns there.  Towyn Spawns west of blackburrow on the beach (tons of crabs around, and him wandering around like an idiot, can't miss him).  Sarn spawns near the keep of the gnoll slayer. He can spawn up the hill at that gnoll camp, from what ive heard, but I found him wandering around down near the griffin tower.  At this point I suggest you help your newfound friends with some of there quests, and once that's done, head over to the north qeynos gates and up to flippy's hill.  There are some green / gray con gnolls with your name on them.  Slaughter them until you have 500 gnolls killed.  Then go visit Vishra.  <br />
<br />
Vishra Part 2.<br />
<br />
Vishra will tell you to talk to Timothy Cooper.  He's located on the docks near the ruins of caltorsis.  Take the griffin to the oracle tower, he's east along the shore.  Watch out for lizards and undead, going to need to be sneaky here.  Once you get onto the dock talk to him.  He will tell you to talk to Felzik Dursin.  Now he tells you that this guy will give you work.  he wont, he will attack you upon talking to him.  He is harder than any of the named gnolls.  So bring some friends, and expect a decent fight.  Felzik spawns in the windstalker village, around dawn if he's been killed recently.  Otherwise he likes to walk up into the woods up the hill east of the village (up the hill heading toward fangbreaker keep.  Kill him, then return to talk to vishra.  <br />
<br />
Vishra Part 3<br />
<br />
Thank your friends, because the rest of this quest is grunt work.  Vishra is very proud of you but wants you to run some errands.  First run to the Claymoore statue and talk to Wolfgang, once your done run to the keep of the gnollslayer and talk to Sialla, and finally back to Vishra.  Vishra tells you to go speak to a priest to confess your sins.  Seek out Rachelle she is located in the middle qeynos tower, second from the left out from north qeynos.  Talk to her and confess all your sins.  Once your done, talk to Vishra And congratulations your a Qeynos Citizen.<br />

Combat Guide<br />
Open with Backstab or Ambush, whichever you have the highest lvl skill in.<br />
HO&amp;lt;DT&amp;lt;QF&amp;lt;Gouge&amp;lt;HO&amp;lt;DT&amp;lt;Bludgeon&amp;lt;Gouge&amp;lt;HO&amp;lt;DT&amp;lt;Bludgeon  <br />
Rinse Repeat, at least at the lvl you'll be doing this quest.  <br />
Whoever told you Ho's was a waste of time doesn't solo much.<br />

<br />
The two BB gnolls, one can be found in the miners area which is at your immediate left when entering BB, and one in the cave straight back from entrance with the waterfall and the angler gnolls. Go into the cave and follow the stream back and he'll be on a landing to your right.</div></div><hr />
