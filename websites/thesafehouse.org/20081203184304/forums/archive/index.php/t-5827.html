<br />
cost of ragebringer: <br />
3k + journeymans walking stick for smr<br />
3k for ishva<br />
300pp for oracle<br />
mrylo arms, fbss, kelorek dar spine razor, and 1,000 plat for frozen shard which i traded straight across for froglock bonecaster robe, which i traded  for kedge (thanks prin  )<br />
<br />
So was it really worth it?  .................</div></div><hr />

If it's that expensive to do the quest then I should pretty much destroy my note bottom. Thats like what 30k or more worth of stuff? I'd be surprised if I'v made 5k from release up to now with all my characters combined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Slyy Daugg</div><div class="date">07-18-01, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kordesh..5k with all character's combined since the release of the game?  Man, this is coming from a poor rogue who hardly has nuthin, so don't think I am trying to rub your nose in it, but...that's pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kordesh</div><div class="date">07-18-01, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well none of my characters have actually gotten passed lvl 30 untill now. Normally I got to lvl 30, got tried and quit for maybe 2 months and came back and started a different character. My rogue can make 1k a week but still that would take 30weeks, I'm not very good with cash on EQ. I was still in a thrug robe when everyone else who was 20 lvls below me were getting FBR when I played my necro. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aeneus</div><div class="date">07-18-01, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you got worked a bit on the frozen shard trade.  Maybe it is because I am on Xev and everyone is stingy with their platinum but I got my frozen shard for a jagged diamond dagger and a locustlure and then sold it for 5k and a knuckle duster (About 10k total).<br />
<br />
But all in all, regardless of what you pay for your ragebringer if you don't think it was worth it then something is wrong.  I absolutely adore mine and would have traded everything me for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Warangel T Marr</div><div class="date">07-18-01, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was guildless throughout the quest<br />
<br />
so for any general raid i went too (just one, mine) i was a guest and couldnt rightly ask for one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also i'm one of those people who want something done, and done quickly.   example, did the quest in one day (up till general).  <br />
<br />
The thing about it being worth it or notwas more along the lines of it not being a quest, just a few big purchases to make.  RB quest was a total joke, and no i'm not advocating making it so you have to kill 15 uber guild, 40+ people mobs - thats just ridiculous, but a more fleshed out story line, and actual questing that you can do solo.<br />
<br />
Burning rapier is still my favorite weapon, that quest just gave me a HUGE  feeling of accomplishment - whereas the ragebringer was just another trophy</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Warangel T Marr</div><div class="date">07-19-01, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">looking at the list of stuff i had to sell, you can see its obviously not &quot;free&quot;<br />
<br />
People in a large guild might disagree - but their opinions really dont matter to me  <br />
<br />
damn leeches getting everything they want/need with no actual effort put in.  takes ALL the sport out of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is it about the Ragebringer that you feel in so offensive to you?<br />
<br />
Is it because you like to tick people off?<br />
<br />
Is it because you have never had a character over 30?<br />
<br />
Is it because you aren't in a guild and therefore despise anyone with an Epic?<br />
<br />
wtf?<br />
