<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aakar Pendragon</div><div class="date">06-14-02, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to figure out the best combination of weapons to use for my Shadowblade. <br />
I am currently level 48 with the following stats: <br />
33 Axe (Raising it to 39) <br />
39 Left Axe <br />
35 CS <br />
35 Stealth <br />
25 Envenom (Raising it to 29) <br />
<br />
I am currently using DF/Hoarfrost Armor, and the following weapons: <br />
<br />
Right Axe <br />
Infernal Barbed Axe <br />
DPS: 16.2 <br />
Delay: 3.5 <br />
Quality: 91% <br />
Bonus: 25% <br />
+13 Con <br />
+5 Axe <br />
Proc at 49 <br />
<br />
Left Axe <br />
Ebony Axe of Mindless Rage <br />
DPS: 16.2 <br />
Delay: 2.4 <br />
Quality: 89% <br />
Bonus: 25% <br />
+9 Str <br />
+15 Hps <br />
-15 Int <br />
<br />
I am not sure if this is the best setup however. I do like the fast left hand axe, but seeing as my Str, and Dex are both capped even without the axe, I am wondering if there is a better option. <br />
I have a Shimmering Arcanium Hand Axe in the bank with 98% Qual. <br />
I have the following axes in the bank: <br />
- Golden Alloy Axe <br />
- Infernal Spined Axe <br />
- Frozen Windswept Axe <br />
<br />
Any ideas on what would be the best setup? Im not the best at crunching numbers, so any help is appreciated. I am just trying to find the best setup until I am lucky enough to get a prince/legion drop or something like that  <br />
<br />
Another question as well on item drops... <br />
Any one know what drops the following? <br />
- Double Bladed Black Ice Razor (Raum) (WoW I think?) <br />
- Immolated Dragonfire Cleaver (Malm) <br />
<br />
Thank you for any advice/comments!</div></div><hr />

Anything else is total crap and just good for the stats.  But when a shammy buffs you for 70, what the hell good is an extra lousy 10 in a stat.  Much better to have the highest quality weapons available, and enchant them to have 35% bonus.</div></div><hr />
