<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-05-07, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Fate/Stay Night game had the first arc (of three) translated. The three arcs are Fate (which the anime was more or less based on), second is Unlimited Blade Works (a story more centered around Archer and Shirou), and the third is Heaven's Feel (a story more centered around Sakura, and Rin).<br />
<br />
I'm ECASTIC! It's one of my favorite games. Keep in mind there is some ero content, but you'll bore yourself to death trying to find them. They take such a minor, minor, minor backseat to the story.<br />
<br />
The style of gameplay is similar to Tsukihime. So make the wrong choice, you die! And a tip I learned playing the game, try to mold your own beliefs to fit that of Shirou's. You can't play the game with your own beliefs, unless you're a naive idiot.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

<br />
You need to buy the game to play the patch. I'll show you guys where it is later if you need help, but I already have the game, the patch download is done, and I'm bailing on you guys halfway! Ha!</div></div><hr />

How is being a naive idiot different from being Shirou?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">05-05-07, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I allways wondered why I kept seeing the phrase 'Unlimited Blade Works', in english, on otherwise completely hira/kata/kanji pages. Now I know the source.<br />
 <br />
GO JOE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-05-07, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the Unlimited Blade Works chant was specifically translated into English by Nasu (the author). He had a native english speaker write it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-06-07, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cried twice during the Fate route ending. The game is truly wonderful. For the record, the Fate route (the shortest route of all three) took me 21 hours to complete. That's 21 hours of actual playing, excluding any break time. So the entire game combined is approximately 70-80 hours.<br />
<br />
In word count, it rivals the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />
<br />
It was indeed awesome.</div></div><hr />
