Let's try to think of how a bleeding edge rogue can succeed and be on par with similar level rogues on other Zeks in a totally undeveloped economy.<br />
<br />
1) Money.  It appears that the Warrens has the best loot at early levels.  Moving a rogue there quickly is going to lead to money in your pocket, maybe enough to try to become a blacksmith.  My enchanter has earned over 100 pp by fighting there for four levels prior to level 10.  However, neutral rogues will likely be killed in Paineel by the evil team unless some sort of custom is established where neutrals respect heretics and vice versa (as the heretics will be extremely short on healers--assuming cross neutral-evil healing is allowed).  I had wanted to play a halfling rogue.<br />
<br />
The next most highest amount of money may be earned from hunting bandits.  Bronze weapons and sashes which yield more bronze.  However, you have to get to level 10 first.  Old money makers such as orc belts and pads will likely not be profitable because of the one character rule.<br />
<br />
Wisps are a third option, but this leads us to the question of...<br />
<br />
2) Weapons.  Giant snake fang is obtainable at level 10 or so.  Bronze yaris at level 4-5 in the warrens.  The minotaur axe can be gotten at 13.  Store bought rapiers and spears will cost about 18 pp, but sell back for nearly the same amount.  Forging weapons may have to be considered.<br />
What are the first magic weapons that can be obtained?  Crookstinger.  Mining pick 828.  Crystal-something dagger from the Lake Rathetear gnolls.  <br />
<br />
3) Armor.  Leather (and orc vest) and banded are likely to be the rogue's mainstay armor especially in an item loot environment.  Runnyeye will have the best armor around for someone in her high teens and 20s.  Resist gear will be limited to enchanter gear until the first bloodstained mantles enter the market.<br />

You indicated this in your post.<br />
<br />
Strategies will (or at least should) vary widely depending on the race/diety combo of the rogue.  I anticipate the server being very PvP active after level 5.  This will affect alot of strategies.<br />
<br />
I'm still debating the class I might play, let alone the race/deity or other strategies.<br />
<br />
Considering:<br />
<br />
Barbarian/Tribunal/Rogue.  Learing to make patchwork is relatively quick (lotsa bear cubs).  Stats are good.  Good hunting nearby (not gonna be alot of &quot;Binders&quot; around).<br />
<br />
Troll/Cazic/Shadowknight.  Mesh/Netted easy to come by.  Good hunting nearby.  Regen and Harm Touch for PvP.<br />
<br />
Half Elf/Karana?/Ranger.  Qeynos.  Tracking.  Archery.  Infravision.  <br />
<br />
Human/Erollisi/Paladin.  Freeport (is there anything that you can't get in FP?).  LOH.  Befallen.<br />
<br />
Euridite/Bertox/Necro.<br />
<br />
Lotsa choices.  Only one per account.  I really would like to see the Diety/Team breakdown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzena</div><div class="date">06-06-01, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something to also bear in mind is team territory.<br />
<br />
Warrens is going to be full of evils. <br />
Runnyeye is going to be neutral or good/neutral.<br />
Etc.<br />
<br />
Best combo (IMO) for a rogue when the server first opens is barb rogue of Bristlebane or The Tribunal.<br />
<br />
They get a decent newbie zone, the patchwork armour quest, the fang of the wolf quest and the black wolf armour quest all in their home city. Not bad going. Itzena Alhazared, Officer of Combine Resurrection<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Karne Ariethkuul COS</div><div class="date">06-06-01, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Growing up a rogue on a brand new server will be both challenging and exciting for you guys/gals.  My first magic weapon was the one from Lake Rathe.  I was so excited, because my caster friends were making bank off the wisp stones, and I could not hit one yet....because guess what humans can't see.  That and the quest.<br />
<br />
Early armor...if you know how try to invest in learning smithing, you will make bank.  I remember buying banded like 12ish and it cost nearly all my coin, and it was from the 4th person I had seen selling and the best price at the time.<br />
<br />
If you have played a rogue on a blue server, play it same way here....Just remember to bring your gang with you when scouting for gear.  At low levels, unless you have good friends its hard to get people interested in helping the rogue.  If your playing an Iggle on the New Zek.  I will be glad to offer any advice and/or help I can.  I will be there as a Wizard or Monk or Shaman....I keep faltering between the three.  Bleh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, strategy...Make friends with a chanter and learn about good low level resist gear early.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if I'm wrong, but which rogue race can actually be on the good team?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kilii</div><div class="date">06-07-01, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wood elf can be on the good team.   <br />
<br />
The warrens won't be all evil.  The whole Prexus team should be in the warrens also.  I'd say there will be more neutrals there than evil.<br />
<br />
I am planning on playing a mage for two reasons and I don't know which is more important.   The ability to gate out of a situation (and bind).  Also Monster Summoning is just the coolest spell in the game as far as I'm concerned and I could give a rat's ass about the numbers.  I'll be on the good side and will be a scourge to the evils and those on the neutral side foolish enough to tangle with me.   Good luck to those brave enough to be rogues.  I'll be availiable to summon some magic weapons for you if you want to go hunting wisps and such.  I have absolutely no idea what my name will be.    Good hunting in the newest lands.<br />
