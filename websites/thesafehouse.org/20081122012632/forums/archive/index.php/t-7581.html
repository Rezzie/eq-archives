Enchanters were really hurting for some help - but this is just sick.  Magicians and shamen can now basicly take your resists down to your naked stats if you're well equipped - and lower if you arent.  In my opinion - they should have only upgraded the tash line.. and not all debuffs.  Shamen never had trouble with pvp.. and magicians are doing fine.  Druids were always fine with pvp - and now their fire resist debuffs make them even better.  <br />
<br />
Being a melee on rallos zek just got a bit harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Breath of Ro 52 dot removes 31 fire resist when used on mobs.<br />
<br />
Those 2 together now remove 81 on mobs and 122 on a player Isn't that a bit much? Does Ros fiery sundering stack with breath of ro? if so thats another 36 vs mobs and 54 vs players taking the pvp total up to 176.<br />
<br />
This is a change basicly based on the fact that a) enc need the buff to their tash line and they do b) people on the team servers can wear whatever they want with no fear of losing it so at high lvls they are all running around in expensive resist gear all the time.<br />
<br />
eqdb.allakhazam.com/ has a thing where you can select items for each slot from a drop down list and view your stats with a given set of gear.  See just what you have to have to bring your saves to a point where Ice doesn't drop your fr to a point where every dd after will hit for full...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cylant</div><div class="date">06-03-01, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What can *I* do?<br />
Well.. i can't wear a set of equipment worth more than my PvE set for PvPing.. thats for damn sure.  I can understand the change on the team servers - but on rallos zek it's very uncool.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure the two druid spells stack aerimus - but don't quote me on that.  If they do - druids just got a huge advantage.  I can't afford to get any of my resists to 176 - let alone anywhere above that.<br />
<br />
Basicly what this patch did to the class balance on rallos zek is this.<br />
<br />
The melee killing a caster situation is still the same.. the only way the caster will die is if the melee gets really lucky - or finds the caster low on health.  If not, the caster just runs away, unable to be hit by you due to the lag issue with running and hitting things.. and gates.<br />
<br />
<br />
The caster killing a melee situation is changed a bit.  Resisting things will be harder now - if a debuff lands on you, you don't have much of a chance of getting away unless you're really gutsy and you're wearing 20k worth of resist items.  In the past you were able to resist a few snares/roots and partially resist a few nukes, giving you time to escape.</div></div><hr />

Ro's Fiery Sundering and Breath of Ro   do stack in PvE encounters... I'd assume they do in PvP as well.  Ice is a bit short duration-wise to use as a reliable debuff(only 18 seconds), but both of the longer-lasting druid spells   will stack with shaman/mage debuffs.  If you get teamed up on by a druid and shaman/mage, prepare to have either a FR higher than 200, or prepare to have negative fire resists    Mathas Oakheart - 60th Hierophant, Bristlebane<br />

Its worked well for me so far...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's harder now, but really it was easier than ye think t' get a good set o' resist gear if ye take a break from levellin' an' go haggle in Faydark, Thurgadin or Firiona.  Best advice I kin give ye is t' concentrate on resist items that either give ye at least +10 in a save or more than that in mulitple saves.  If ye kin get every item on ye t' add resist then yer headed in th' right direction.<br />
