Look up ORIGA, the vocalist for both Rise and Inner Universe. She has some great music.<br />
 <br />
As far as music from series.... Hmmm... Lesse:<br />
 <br />
Yuki Kajiura (Noir, Madlax, Mai-HiME, Tsubasa Chronicle, ect.)<br />
Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop, Wolf's Rain, Arjuna, Turn 'A' Gundam, ect.)<br />
The Thrill (Blue Submarine No. 6)<br />
Toshiyuki O'mori (Tsukihime)<br />
The original Tenchi Muyo! OAV had some great music- but don't get the soundtrack you can find easily in stores here, it sucks. There's one with all of the background music, it's fantastic.<br />
 <br />
Continuing on with a few series with good soundtracks:<br />
Stellvia <br />
Last Exile <br />
Haibane Renmei <br />
Full Moon o Sagashite ('Final Live' disc)<br />
Escaflowne MOVIE soundtrack<br />
Please! Twins<br />
.hack//SIGN<br />
BECK<br />
Ai Yori Aoshi<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Just depends on what kinda music yer lookin for, really.</div></div><hr />

Dib's on Lenilya's .hack//SIGN OST's and anything related to the OST's. And to top it off to make the trade even I guess I can see or get a list of what OST's my GF has of some of her anime she love's. God forbid it wont all be Inuyasha =/ I get enough to much of her talking non stop about it; it makes me wish I never knew the anime. Let alone the word &quot;Anime&quot;<br />
<br />
Also while posting this. Anyone have OST's from anime just with the music and no lyrics being sung? I tend to think lyrics and such make some song's a bit well I duno guess you can say not cool in its sort of way.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I seperate 'songs' from 'music'. Most OST's that aren't hugely mainsteam have all instrumental background music on the discs, save for maybe the opening/ending themes. <br />
 <br />
Example:<br />
Cowboy Bebop is known for having great Songs.<br />
Stellvia has great Music.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I recently got both and to say the least, I am in Love. Kunihiko Ryou did amazing job. Most of them are vocaless instrumental/electronical.<br />
<br />
It sounds magical on my Senns HD650.<br />
<br />
Oh this OST as well.<br />
<br />
Victorian romance Emma Original Soundtrack - Silhouette of a Breeze<br />
<br />
Len I noticed that you are missing the ones I just listed, a big loss.</div></div><hr />

Haven't seen those. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-16-07, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Victorian Romance Emma is an excellent victorian european era series about a maid falling in love with nobility. It's not your generic anime maid, but a much more realistic take.<br />
<br />
A excellent series imo, I recommend it.</div></div><hr />

Saiunkoku no Monogatari is also worth seeing.</div></div><hr />
