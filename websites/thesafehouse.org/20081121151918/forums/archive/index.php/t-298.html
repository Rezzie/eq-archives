<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bikbuz</div><div class="date">12-21-99, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had just reached my 13th season as a rogue of Bristlebane. I had yet to pay off my debt to my guild master, so I decided Steamfront was no longer the place for me. I bought up some bandages, food,water and few spare arrows and headed for the infamous Crushbone<br />
 <br />
After I purchsed a spirit of the wolf from a friend tree-hugger, I made my way into Lesser Faydark. Twas a new and exciting experiance for me. I had heard of a large wasp that was named Crookstinger, whos stinger was a nice weapon for any rogue. I kept a eye out for him on my way down the path but made no real effort to locate him. After a short while, I came upon a lone orc centurien(sp) wandering the forest. Upon assesing my foe, I began to sneak/hide my way behind him. Not to long after he stopped to gather his surroundings and thats when I struck. My fine steel spear plunged into his back for a good deal of damage. And the fight began. Twas a difficult fight from the start. I was unsure how to wield my short sword and my spear at the same time. Athough my new skill was not amazing, the few times I hit helped. Not long after the fight began, the orc decided to flee from a creature half his size. I grined evily and plunged my spear into his back for the killing blow.  <br />
<br />
After looting his corpse I returned to the path and reached Greater Faydark. Twas an amazing site to behold for a young gnome as my self. I rushed to the ever-famous &quot;orc lift&quot; to get my soul bound. As I ran I almost fell onto my face as a young wood elf lass ran past. Twas an amazing place. I was soon bound to the strange lift and began seeking a group to aid me in Crushbone. Not long after, a young bard came and invited me to his group, himself, a wizzy,druid,cleric and a ranger. After a short trip from the lift, we reached Crushbone, the local orcs being to afraid to challange us.  <br />
<br />
Upon the arrival at Crushbone, we noticed many people sitting outside of the foul lair of the orcs. Upon asking a few what was oocuring inside, we discoverd the foul dark elf, Ambassador Dvinn, had decided to leave the tower and wreak havok amoung the weaker warriors.   <br />
<br />
 We rushed inside and discoverd a few higher warriors cutting the local orcs to shreds and makin Dvinn pay for his crimes. We were amazed at the skill of the high elf taking Dvinn down. He was clad in bronze platemail and wielding a HUGE two handed sword. With in a few moments of us ariving, Dvinn was slain and the orc rush stopped. The High elf nodded to us and headed back twards the Castle of Crushbone.   <br />
<br />
After picking a few weaker orcs up off the out skirts of the Castle, we decided to be bold and go closer. A short trip and we came to the bridge that led into the vile building and made camp. The local orcs were nothing against our well trained party. The ranger kept the orcs off me as I slid my spear into thier backs time and time again.   <br />
<br />
All of a sudden, a HUGE orc came tearing out of the castle, hot on the young wood elf lass I saw on my way to Kelethin. My group paniced and ran. As a rogue, I have a few rules. One of those is &quot;Never let a wood elf lady in leather die.&quot; So I left this group of cowards, and preceded to launch a attack on Emp. Crushbones backside. My spear riped into him a few times before he turned to face me. By now, many others had come to the wood elfs aid and were blasting, hacking, clubing away at him.   <br />
<br />
He soon turned tail, orcs seem to do this, and ran off twards Greater Faydark. I, being small, ran between a large barbarians legs and lept up and plunged my spear deep into Crushbones back, sending a part of his lungs with it. My spear stuck in Crushbones back, I tossed my short sword into my main hand, and hacked at the large orcs head. Not long after, the orc feel to my, and many others, attacks. Amazed as I was that such a huge creature could die, I also felt my skill level rise. I knew more on my duel wield and other skills.   &amp;lt;<br />
<br />
Alas, Emp. Crushbone did not have his famed ringmail shirt on. It twas an amazing day. I learned that, despit being small, my power was large, and was growing by the day.  <br />

OOC- I know this sounds odd, but I decided to RP this story. The spear being lost in Crushs back was a late add-in. Hope yall enjoyed it.<br />
