<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TheSmilingTree</div><div class="date">02-23-02, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never been too impressed with the idea of swinging an axe in my offhand, but was wondering if i'd be severely lowering the potential of my character if I did not spec in LA, or even if anyone has any insight into how a character without LA would play comparatively to one with it.  I'm kinda worried after the last patch, that Mythic intends for us to spec in left axe and it is now part of their vison for the character.<br />
<br />
My current template is: <br />
<br />
40 Stealth<br />
39 Sword<br />
39 Critical Strike<br />
41 Envenom<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
39 Stealth<br />
39 Sword<br />
39 Critical Strike<br />
42 Envenom<br />
<br />
Depending on how many envenom items I can find - I would like to be able to use Greater Cripling (42) at least, and Insidious Lethal (45) if I can.<br />
<br />
I'm new to playing a Shadowblade and right now i'm only level 10, but I find that I block at least once per battle with a small shield and have no problem landing two poisons which is all I did with my Infiltrator and Nightshade anyway.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time everyone.<br />

I only recently started using 2h in rvr as well.  sword and shield is quite viable if you dont neglect your weapon spec. Dither Disgustipated<br />

<br />
Also, what kind of one hander would you suggest using with a shield?  Fast and light?  Or something abit heavier, like a Bastard sword.  I know it ultimately comes down to opinion, or maybe whatever you can find that is good for you level.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dither DAoC</div><div class="date">02-25-02, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always looked for swords 3.0 spd or faster.  player crafted short swords, the flame forged, etc.  not many drops are this quick, but it worked out nicely for me.  oddly enough, I have recently started testing things with 2h weapons, and I end fights almost exactly the same end/health with a Twilight 2h sword that has +2 sword, as i do with a 1h dwarven short sword.  I'd like to compare the golden alloy 1h and 2h sometime, to see how it pans out, but the alloy 1h is a bit slow at ~4 spd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TheSmilingTree</div><div class="date">02-25-02, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my limited understanding the endurance used on a weapon is based on it's speed as well - and usually evens out.  I can also see how the damage bonus and the defensive penults of a 2H would almost offset the defensive bonus of a shield and the increase in number of hits.<br />
<br />
It's not the actual delay that bugs me about 2H weapons.  But what if I miss?  I don't mind if my target hits me 3 times before I hit again granted I do equal or more damage.  But if I miss with my 2H, I might as well call it a day, I usuall can't catch back up.  Also, i've found myself dying many times because it came down to the last few hits and I got killed before I could swing again - there a 1H weapon would have saved me since the average damage output would have been equal with the target.<br />
<br />
Although average DPS is the same on a lot of weapons, I don't find that it works that way in practice.  Because i've found in that faster weapons do damage more evenly. While larger weapons seem to go either way more often, either i'm way ahead, or way behind - and that often depends on my target.<br />
