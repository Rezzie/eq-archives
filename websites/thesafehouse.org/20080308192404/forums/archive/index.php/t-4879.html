<br />
My stats are(w/ items):<br />
CS 38<br />
Stealth 31<br />
Sword 30<br />
<br />
I have all orange and yellow equipment<br />
<br />
I use 2-handed sword to open then switch to one handed and shield rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
I have been fight ww but only can kill blues on a regular bases.  I can kill yellows but there is always that one time I die to and thats all you need to ruin your night.  My friend, who is a skald a lvl lower then me, can kill the yellow ones with ease.  Am I doing something wrong or are sb really that bad at pvm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_sammyd11</div><div class="date">02-13-02, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not bad my friend - you kill yellows probably 90% of the time it sounds like.  That's very good actually, but not good enough to solo because you are right - one death wipes out an hour's worth of work.<br />
<br />
IMHO, you have specced fine, you do very well, and that's just how it is.  Other classes may solo better.  Also, remember there are high yellows and low yellows, and no way to tell the difference.  Also, pick mobs that you get a plus against and they get a minus against you.  This makes a *huge* difference.<br />
<br />
Finally, I will add there is one way to tell if you should run that works pretty well.  I was soloing blues and yellows last night, and I noticed that if a mob hit me for over 100, it was going to be a very close fight.  If I PAed for less than 180, same deal.  So with yellow con mobs, I would PA and the mob would swing at me.  If my PA did less than 180 and he hit me for over 100, I would hit Creeping Death and sprint my ass off during the stun.  Then I could come back later and kill him when he was wounded.  I had no deaths using that guideline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And always, and I mean always, having to find the exact perfect mob that gets a minus against me and I get a pluss on is also frustrating. Meanwhile back at the ranch everyone else is just blasting everything in their path never worring about the perfect mobs.</div></div><hr />

Other classes can and will solo harder monsters than we can with ease. This is our lot in life and as far as I'm concerned it weeds out those not dedicated enough to the task.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been using garrot combo mostly but was wondering if people thought assault combo better cause it takes out less end.  I always try to do hamstring combo as much as possible but you know how hard that can be to do sometimes. Edited by: CiseroOfMid at: 2/13/02 12:22:38 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
It allows you to put your lvl, your armor type, damage output type and realm to pick the perfect mobs for you.  Then after you find a good map, its not hard to find these mobs and kill away.<br />

That program explains exactly why I quit, when I quit. At level 23 in Midgard there are exactly ZERO mobs weak to my attacks and weak against leather.<br />
<br />
Sure I could still kill yellows (probably 95% of those I fought) but I could never find anything that I could fight that did not have wanderers and so would continously die to the blue and green adds. If I could have ever found someone to group with after level 15 I might've continued but the experience nerf that Vera... err Mythic put in made everyone incredably stingy with their groups.
