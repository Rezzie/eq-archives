What would the minimum force (number and class makeup) be to drop the King and Prince in Chardok?<br />
<br />
The players in question are mostly level 65 and of various gear quality.  I would say gear would be at the initial stages of NToV &quot;ish&quot; if that helps.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That may be true, but not real helpful.  Is your point that a level 65 Bard can solo this encounter if they aren't KOS?  I'd have to guess that a non-KOS char would not want to take the faction hit.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas folks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Omenius</div><div class="date">05-30-03, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done probably 20-30 Chardok raids and I cannot say enough how much I hate this place. You have two ways of doing this: Take 2-4 hours clearing your way to the royals, or have a mage that is non KOS CoH you directly to the place you want to be. The prince is very easy, though his croonies can ruin a raid very quickly. All of my raid forces first cleared the area around the locked door leading to his chambers, then pulled him and his croonies all together. Chanters AOE mezzed and we took the prince out first. He could probably be done with 1 group, though it isn't recommended. (I would suggest 2-2.5 groups) Keep in mind crowd control is a major point here. On the other hand, the king is a total bitch. There are (2) locked doors that are needed to be opened to get to him. The first area contains a hallway with several mobs close enough to often social aggro, beyond the hallway is a staircase with even more mobs. I'm sure you've done your homework (or I would hope so), so I won't dawdle on with methods of doing these areas. Chardok is not a good zone to try to wing. The area before the second locked door can be done with maybe 2 groups, 3+ would be best. After the second locked door, the area is -pretty- easy, all until up to his chamber; which contains literally an army of sarnaks. This area is usually zerged just because of all the f`in adds. It is very difficult to single this area, but I suppose it could be done if you have a lot of patience and your enchanters have alot of mana. The king himself isn't too bad, however his mistress is one hell of a force. On a side note, many`a raid I've been in has wiped because someone got too close to the queen's chamber and aggroed her and her friends. Her area is in close proximity to the king. For quickest results more is always better it seems here, and I've done a heck of a lot better with a 36 person raid than a 18 person raid. Good luck on your raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
having a non kos mage saves you tons of time, as mentioned above.  I went on a pickup chardok raid just for the heck of it, 2 groups average equipped were able to get a coh down and take out the king and prince.  Just make everyone has lev before you head down the stairs in the library and that they keep moving before the locked door.  If any of them sink down through the false floor, they'll probably train you with the king hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_wyrmbane</div><div class="date">05-30-03, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on what you posted, mostly lvl 65 people, here is what you need (or what I recommend)<br />
<br />
Pacification Spell - <br />
Enchanter - Lvl 62 or Cleric level 65<br />
--Reason: you can Pacify the prince &amp;amp; king, thereby killing half or all of their guards.  After that, they are wimps.   Note, the Pacify (max lvl 55 mob) spell will pacify everything in chardok except ancient golems, king, queen, prince.<br />
<br />
Rogue -<br />
Must have the rogue to get into the keep area, through locked doors<br />
<br />
Crown Control - <br />
Bard 60+ or enchanter 62+<br />
You will get 1-3 mobs most of the time, Just makes it easier, especially in the herbalist room and while killing prince / king.<br />
<br />
Tank - 1<br />
<br />
Slower - enchanter or shaman, or put bard on double duty<br />
<br />
Damage dealers - others<br />
<br />
Healing - 58+ druid or shaman or cleric<br />
<br />
We did it just the other week with the following people:<br />
Cleric 55 - he needed the scroll from king<br />
Warrior 65 - main tank<br />
Paladin 65 - puller / pacify on way to king, heal support, add tank<br />
Rogue 63 - lock pick, our DPS<br />
Shaman 65 - slows, heals, buffs, etc<br />
Druid 62 - Secondary healer, snare<br />
Enchanter 62 - pacification &amp;amp; crowd control<br />
<br />
That was it.   Total time from zone in to chardok until king dead and looted?  2 hours.   We killed everything from zone in to the king.  At the king's room, we pacified the king + 4 sarnaks.  Killed the other 4.   Second time we were going to kill the remaining 4 guards, but the king agro'd on pacify and we just killed him while mezing his guards.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps you.<br />

<br />
we get to the royals in about 20 minutes AE'ing chardok</div></div><hr />

<br />
King: Bard uses Kelins on room or the clerics pacify thru the wall, single pull king. whack him. loot.<br />
<br />
Prince: same except you have to CoTH a bard playing group invis first so everyone stays invis until you're ready to whack the locals. Rogue with super sneak just targets for the pacifiers (no, not Nuk brand).</div></div><hr />

I gave you the answer. <br />
<br />
You would also need a rogue to unlock the door.<br />

Quote:1 good level 65 bard that is not KoS in Chardok.<br />
Quote:That may be true, but not real helpful. Is your point that a level 65 Bard can solo this encounter if they aren't KOS? I'd have to guess that a non-KOS char would not want to take the faction hit.A bard never has to take a faction hit they do not want to take. And yes, if he wants to, a bard can also solo the encounter.<br />
<br />
All royals in Chardok can be single pulled to the zone by a good, non-KoS bard. It does take some skill however.<br />
<br />
There is a HUGE difference in these fights depending on your levels. I remember entire raids of upwards of 50 players dying to the king/queen when we were mostly in the upper 50s. At 65, a single group with decent gear and skills can do them with the cleric casting just 1 CH.<br />
<br />
And if you are going to go down to the royals area, a high level, skilled bard will make life 100 times easier. Edited by: Bigmeeno at: 5/31/03 3:39:11 am</div></div><hr />

It's much easier with a class with the pacify line i.e. paladin, enchanter, cleric, bard.<br />
<br />
If you have non KoS people, 2 level 65 can kill the king.</div></div><hr />

Wake of Tranquility works fine on the King's guards at least (level 51 enchanter spell, IIRC). It's easier if the enchanter is non-kos, obviously. It's less fun if you get a resist. WoT lasts longer than Pacify, I belive - at least I had no trouble WoT both sides then pulled King + 2 guards (and when I pulled I only ever got the king or a guard single, possibly they're close enough to the WoT AOE.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sippin7</div><div class="date">06-05-03, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did both Prince and the King with a relatively low level force of  15. Lowest was 49. Highest was ONE level 65 enchanter.<br />
<br />
Using BOTH pacify and pacification, she was able to pacify 7 of the 8 King's guards; King came with 1 guard. She got all 8 of the Prince's guards so he came solo.<br />
<br />
She used bind sight on a nonKOS rogue. He picked the Prince's door, moved in and panned the room while she alternated castings of the two spells. <br />
<br />
A nonKOS CoH mage would be super... we didn't have one. So the hardest part of killing these two Royals for our raid was making it to them.</div></div><hr />

I've went on one venture down with him and we killed King with 5 due to LD rogue.<br />
<br />
So with PoP the and Pacification I can't see it taking more than 2 groups 54-65 to do it no matter how bad off people are geared.<br />

On queen, just don't let her gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Masin</div><div class="date">06-16-03, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">agreed that pacifying the guards works wonders.<br />
<br />
Used a team of enchanter, paladin, cleric to pull/pacify all guards.  Seems to work very well.  The cleric lvl 39? pacify or Donals bracer (same spell basically) works just fine on the guards.  Wake of Tranq will work wonders as well.  Able to pull the Prince and King solo easily each time.<br />
<br />
A trick to use with the king is to use bind site.  If you can get a guard targetted, you can usually bind site around the room to get everyone in the Kings chambers pacified.  Then a pull of the King solo to the hallway above is pretty easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I farmed him a bit with a 61ish wiz 61ish enc 65 druid myself 60-61 war 2 boxed 60-61 cleric and various, usually druid, classes 60-62.<br />
<br />
had friend with dubious faction open door, friend with ally coh the kos to the kings hall both rog and mage logged then. We killed roamers cleric used Wave of Tranq on all mobs but king (king resisted). Had 65 pull king, we killed.<br />
<br />
Enc myself and my cleric were all non kos tho. Being non kos really makes chard royals trivial.</div></div><hr />
