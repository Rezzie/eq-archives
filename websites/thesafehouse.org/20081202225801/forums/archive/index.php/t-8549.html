<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_GeekJoker</div><div class="date">04-28-03, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone done the IA Event with the Warders?<br />
<br />
There are two Vah Shir in cages in one of the rooms.  Clear room and talking to them results in this conversation.<br />
<br />
Here is the text from the NPC:<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:02:18 2003] You say, 'Hail, Spiritist Kama Resan'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:02:18 2003] Spiritist Kama Resan says 'Thank you for coming. I am not sure what brought you here but I am glad that you have arrived. Andro and I came here as part of a raiding party. Our entire party was captured, all except Andro and I died. In the time we have been here, we have learned of 3 [seals which] protect the inner chambers.'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:02:38 2003] You say, 'What seals which ?'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:02:38 2003] Spiritist Kama Resan says 'Interesting, from what we can tell each of the 3 seals embodies one of the principles with which the grimlings were created, Life, Death, and Spirit. Each of the seals has been enclosed in a Warder whose very existence is tied to the seal. Destroy the [Warder] and the seal falls with it.'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:02:56 2003] You say, 'What Warder'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:02:56 2003] Spiritist Kama Resan says 'We have discovered that the Life Ward exists inside this chamber, while the Death Ward exists in a chamber above. The spirit ward is hidden somewhere deeper; we can sense its presence, but cannot find its exact location. We suspect that you cannot reach it with the life and death wards still whole. We fear that the [situation] may be complicated even further.'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:03:16 2003] You say, 'What situation ?'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:03:16 2003] Spiritist Kama Resan says 'The Wards are a by-product of the magic that was used to create the grimlings, there is symmetry between them. We have managed a [spell] that will destroy the magic hiding two of the Wards, the Life Ward and the Death Ward. Starting the spell will cause both to manifest, however the magic protecting the Life Ward will not fall completely until we have completed our spell.'<br />
<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:03:49 2003] You say, 'What spell'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:03:49 2003] Spiritist Kama Resan says 'The spell will use our own life force to break the life ward's shields, we will die shortly after we begin casting, if we do not complete [casting] our spell. Even if we do our life force is tied to that of the Wards, we will die shortly after completion if either Life, or Death Wards still live.'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:04:21 2003] You say, 'What casting?'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:04:21 2003] Spiritist Kama Resan says 'There is one more thing I should mention... While we were perfecting the spell, whenever we would get close the life ward would summon grimlings to disrupt our chants. We are not able to concentrate or focus with them present. You will have to make sure they are not around to stop our magic, and do not forget that the death and spirit wards will resurrect the life ward if one or the other isn't destroyed shortly after if falls. When you are [ready] we will begin.'<br />
<br />
And this from the one in the other cage:<br />
<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:05:29 2003] You say, 'Hail, Spiritist Andro Shimi'<br />
[Thu Apr 24 00:05:29 2003] Spiritist Andro Shimi says 'Greetings, please speak with Kama. She will explain what we need of you. Hurry before the guards return.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-28-03, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">once you start the event with those 2 vah shirs, each cage spawns a spirit jammer.  These do not attack, they just try and stop the vah shirs from chanting.  Kill these first regardless, if you don't, the vah shirs can't chant.  During the ring, skeletons will spawn.  I believe they hit for 5xx and are mezzable but have some decente MR.  We tried with 2 groups but were a bit low on DPS (2 warriors, 1 rogue, 1 ranger for pure melee, 0 mages and 0 wizards) and were not able to get past this portion.  Respawn is about 1 hour and none of us wanted to wait around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_GeekJoker</div><div class="date">04-28-03, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we started it there were 6 spell blocker (3 in each cage).  It seemed that when we killed the first blocker 3 or 4 undead poped named ' a Reanimated Prisoner'<br />
<br />
I looked in the log and about 40 sec after starting the event started. Here is timestamped parts of the log.<br />
<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:51:08 2003] Geekjoker says,  'we are ready to begin our spell'<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:51:08 2003] Spiritist Kama Resan begins to chant, when a circle of grimlings appear and silence the spell.<br />
...<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:51:53 2003] a reanimated prisoner says 'I have been called back to serve the Life Ward, and so I shall. Your death awaits!'<br />
...<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:52:03 2003] Spiritist Kama Resan 's chanting is cut short by the spell jammer's magic.<br />
...<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:52:06 2003] a reanimated prisoner says 'I have been called back to serve the Life Ward, and so I shall. Your death awaits!'<br />
...<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:52:29 2003] a reanimated prisoner says 'Victory in the name of the ward!'<br />
...<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:52:36 2003] As the sacrifice throws itself into the cauldron, the metal begins to steam as the grimling's soul prepares to empower the ward.<br />
...<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:52:38 2003] a reanimated prisoner says 'I have been called back to serve the Life Ward, and so I shall. Your death awaits!'<br />
...<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:52:40 2003] a reanimated prisoner says 'I have been called back to serve the Life Ward, and so I shall. Your death awaits!'<br />
...<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:52:54 2003] Geekjoker has been slain by a reanimated prisoner!<br />
<br />
This is where I died .. lol luckilly another guy was logging.  <br />
<br />
At this point we had one Spell Blocker dead or almost dead and 6+ undead running around killing the Clerics and Chanters.  <br />
<br />
Our level 63 Enchanter was able to mez them but our 61 enchanter was not able to land either a mez or a stun.<br />
<br />
More later when I look at the log a little better.<br />
<br />
The guys log I am looking at goes another 5 min. Here is where he died:<br />
<br />
[Mon Apr 28 04:57:51 2003] Returning to home point, please wait...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Adara the Paladin</div><div class="date">04-28-03, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you clear out the jails of the normal mobs you can start the ring. <br />
<br />
I would suggest a well balanced group in each jail and a Paladi or SK between the two which I will explain later. <br />
<br />
Once you start the event 3 spell jammers will spawn in each jail. You need to kill these as fast as possible and mez the skellies while you kill them. When they are dead in your jail then you kill the skeletons. I think there are 3 waves of spell jammers in each jail so a total of 18 to kill. When you started the even a 'Warder of Life' spawned between the jails and is untargettable. The Paladin/SK/Warrior needs to watch that for the second it is targettable and get aggro from it. If you do not it will go in the cells and kill the two NPCs. When that happens both jails repop instantly with the normal grimlings that were in there and you have failed. I don't remember the exact strategies on the warder but he was lvl 65 and didn't hit all that hard and fast and was slowable if I remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Goetch</div><div class="date">07-12-03, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a write up anywhere?  I'm looking to find out how to take care of both the Warder of Life, and the Warder of Death.  Also if it is necessary to take both out before progressing to the Warder of Spirit (khata sha? Takashi?)</div></div><hr />
