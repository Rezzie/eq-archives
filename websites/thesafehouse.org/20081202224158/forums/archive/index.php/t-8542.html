I am going to make a mule and check Erudin for a possible quest npc, but thought I would ask if perhaps someone found it already, if there is one</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mobs are the undead trolls in nadox i will log on and identify both the blades and the medallion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kilgur Bladebite</div><div class="date">05-22-03, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I handed three Erudin Defender Blades to Brianna Falsruinay in Erudin Docks, hoping to see if she said more, as in maybe the name of the medallion or something useful. Instead, she ate them, and didn't say a word. [Before you say I wasted them, I have more in the bank :-).]<br />
<br />
Generally, I thought if you handed a quest giver some of the items, but not all of them, they would say you need to give them something else, even if they don't mention what that is, they still say something is missing. She did not.<br />
<br />
So my question is: Are these the proper blades?  <br />
<br />
I also thought NPC's didn't take things they didn't want? But then I've seen numerous posts saying LoY era NPC's do take items they don't want. Brianna Falsruinay isn't listed on Allah's beastiary, so I'd say she's a LoY era NPC. So, does that mean the quest is broken? Noone has seen the medallion/amulet, yet, unless it's already been found, but needs to be ID'd to show what it is and that hasn't been done yet.<br />
<br />
If the medallion/amulet is that rare, it sure would suck to turn it in with 3 blades only to watch her eat them.....<br />

There is so much junk flowing from these zones none of it identifies as teh proper peice and im afraid i am have to turn in dozens of things to solve this quest.<br />
This wouldn't be a problem but people just don't like hunting here much.</div></div><hr />
