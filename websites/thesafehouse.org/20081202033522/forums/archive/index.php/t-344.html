    Please have a seat by the window.  I have choosen the Blind Fish to retell a tale of woe and agony.  Innoruuk is pleased with tales like these.  I am Mirak Dulak youngest brother of four and the quiet one of the family.  My eldest brother, Ixnay was father to Savia out of wedlock and out of hard times of war.  With war it seamed that Savia would not follow the honored tradition in the family of the Shadow Knight, like myself and brother Ashriel, or of the Necromancer like her father.  But of the rogue, she had choosen to follow Fideleo's footsteps.  Who knew at the time that a rogue who did not follow Innoruuk would one day lead House Dulak out of the ashes and into power.<br />
     I at first once had a particular disdain for rogues.  In fact I couldn't believe Savia guardian Fideleo choose not to follow Innoruuk.  But those times have pasted as I can see now where Fid, as those close to him know him by, became what as known as the First House to rebel against the Thex family.  Oh now do I see the where I was mistakened.  For the Thex's brough chaos and divided the Houses into strife, instead of joining them.  With Fideleo's uprising and Ixnay's return it was a time of strife in the empire and it foretold of what was to come.<br />
     Oh you ask what of Ixnay's return and why hasn't he surfaced yet.  Well I can only tell you he is changed in his ways of before.  The barbarian rogues used a new poison on him constantly that drained mana as well as weak poisons to torment him while their shaman's keep him alive.  The new warriors in Halas had target pratice with him.  Yes it was a bleak time for a necro.  One day Ixnay devised a plan to escape.  The mana draining poison in front of him.  While the rogue went about their business he took a small blade and emptied his blue blood into a container while his blood still had traces of poison he would swicth the two and drink from his own blood.  Thus came the mana regeneration, not all at once.  He went about this for a month.  The Shamans put him on bed rest and every time he could he would switch the two brews.  Eventually he had the mana required for one spell.  Rattleing his brains he barly got the right words out.  While he painfully chanted the once well know words the rogues out side hear and acted promtly.  A solid backstab was in place and engluphing darkness soon enveloped him.  But by Innoruuk's graces he got the spell off and gated to home.  Unconsious and 10 secs from death he happened to gate right to the spot where he met Savia's mother Vinavia, the Blind Fish.  Aye this very spot one year ago Ixnay excaped and by luck, fate, hate Vinavia was at the same spot mourning her loss friend and saw Ixnay materialize infront of her.  Time was short and she..............<br />
