(I didn't watch the abomination that was the first make), Kanon (26 episodes! Thank the gods!), Kujibiki Unbalance, Otome wa Boku Koi no Shiteru, Happiness!

<br />
A good supply this fall! Lucky.</div></div><hr />

I think its a total remake of it all, since the first run sucked.</div></div><hr />

They intend to do things right this time (i.e. better animation, include the fanservice, better coloring job, better everything.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-16-06, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't believe the huge craze for the anime, Bartender, going on in the USA right now. It hasn't even been released, and nobody in the US knows anything about it?! It's amusing to see.  I mean, I get the idea of why it's cool, and there is a reason I'm looking forward to it, but still pretty odd.<br />
<br />
Anyways..<br />
<br />
Black Blood Brothers - C<br />
<br />
It's a shounen action series. There are two races that we know of so far, Vampires and Humans. There is a city where the two races coexist in peace, but there's a war going on outside of this city which is guarded tightly by an corporation.<br />
<br />
The first episode is very confusing and cluttered. There was a huge action sequence in the beginning, but they never told what it was all about. Then later on there's another battle on a ship, and we still don't know what that battle is about either or anyone's motivations. I'm holding most of my judgement until later episodes come out, which should clear things up a bit.<br />
<br />
One good thing about the show, if anything, is how the older brother beat the living **** out of his younger brother. Some one-sided sibling violence is a nice change! I actually laughed a bit in that part.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kaleido Star Good Dayo! Goo~d! OVA - B+<br />
<br />
I came into this OVA knowing nothing about what it would be about. So yeah, I was suprised when the whole thing was in 2D CG. I was hoping for more of the awesomely beautiful artwork of the TV series and first OVA. Too bad. However, that disappointment aside, it was actually a pretty amusing OVA. While it's odd to see everyone in SD form, their personalities really come through still.<br />
<br />
The opening with them parachuting off the plane was pretty fun to watch. I especially liked May's Cooking Special. But I was ecastic to see Rosetta! I adore her! The way she was making fun of Ken's love for Sora was fun to see! I can't wait for a Rosetta special. (Mahou Shoujo Rosetta? Too bad that rumor wasn't true! Haha)<br />
<br />
I recommend it for Kaleido Star fans, but people new to the series will get the wrong impression by this OVA. And won't understand any of the character dynamics until after seeing the second season. If you haven't seen Kaleido Star, GET IT NOW! It's almost fully released in the US already!</div></div><hr />

I haven't heard anything about it, but maybe some people are familiar with the manga? Or maybe they just miss Cheers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-19-06, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Black Blood Brothers B-<br />
<br />
Watched episode two. A lot of the story kind of makes sense now. It's kind of amusing to watch. But I have a difficult time on who to recommend this to, as I have not read the manga. I don't know what the overall direction of the story is. There were some decent action sequences in the first episode, but they are laying the groundwork for a story now. Whether they will run with it or not, I don't know.<br />
<br />
It's not Hellsing by a long shot.<br />
<br />
Sci Fi HARRY A-<br />
<br />
While this is not a new series (2001), it recently started getting subbed. The series is &quot;licensed&quot; so to speak, by a company that's been sitting on it for five years now. <br />
<br />
I really like this show at the moment, up to episode two. It's got a huge Paranoia Agent feel to it. The art is very unique. It's a story about a high school boy who finds out he has physic powers (the ability to move/bend/break objects) and learns how to use it. This boy has a total Shinji sydrome (yes, Shingi as in NGE) so you'll need to raise your ***** tolerance.<br />
<br />
After gaining this ability, he finds out there's a very serious consequence to using them. Harry is a very creepy guy to look at. He looks like one of those scrawny pale anti-social kids from high school who look like they will grow up to be serial killers. Creeeeepy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-25-06, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the note of Kujian, Genshiken S2 is coming out in a different format. Just like how the first season had 13 episodes of Genshiken and 3 episodes of Kujian, this time around it's 13 episodes of Kujian and 3 episodes of Genshiken on the DVD as specials.<br />
<br />
A TV season would be nice, but this will do. I will give source later when I get a chance if anyone wants to confirm for themselves, but I know this to be a fact from Afternoon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last couple? The first run of Negima barely covered half of the Manga released in english (which owns, btw), which is running about a year behind the Manga released in Japan. 2 more months until volume 12 in english... argh can't wait<br />
<br />
Also, somewhat off topic, but Negima is the only manga I've really liked, can someone recommend something similar that I might enjoy? I dunno if I can stomach Love Hina though (done by the same guy).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The romance (even if it's only cutesy/who-will-he-like romance), the humor (perverted or non), the harem thing, the harry potter effect (regular world with hidden 'magic' world).<br />
<br />
edit: and how could I forget, the fanservice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-30-06, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're talking anime here, I think, so Love Hina anime is mostly out the door. You can try it but the manga is so much better that most people feel it's not worth watching. Of course, Sollon will kill me for that.<br />
<br />
School Rumble might fit the bill. It's pretty out there (loony) but it has it's moments. I really enjoy this show.<br />
<br />
In anime, there's not very many like Negima. You probably would like to check out Zero no Tsukaima, which is fairly close to Negima. <br />
<br />
For something somewhat unrelated, Mai-HiME and Mai-Otome both are excellent. There's a larger emphasis on action, but there's a good amount of romance in it, and a lot of comedy and fanservice.<br />
<br />
Not too many with an Harry Potter effect other than Zero, but other highly recommended harem/comedy shows are:<br />
<br />
Shuffle! (this was very popular here), Ichigo 100% also.<br />
<br />
Man, thinking of Harem shows was harder than I thought. Looking back, I can see I've had a pretty definite change in tastes in this department, so I guess I haven't been keeping up too well here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Love hina the anime was ok but it was mostly pretty sappy romance with comedy really. In the anime fanservice was hardly there =/ (unless you watch the different spin off &quot;movie&quot; type ones...Like the one where they went to that island). The only fanservice heavy version of love hina was the OVA. I still enjoyed Love hina the anime but it is def not the best of them all. <br />
<br />
Altho I do believe love hina the manga is a LOT better then the anime. If you where going to take the chance I would prob read the manga.<br />
<br />
Note: I have only seen some of Negema so it hard for me to compare =/.<br />
<br />
If you want a true harem romance/comedy with fanservice then Shuffle! is #1 :P. What im a Shuffle! fanboi :P.<br />
<br />
Zero no Tsukaima is prob a good watch too but its pretty hard to get =/. Atlest for me =/.<br />
<br />
Hehe too bad you didn't want mostly romance stuff :P thats easier :P.</div></div><hr />

That was the emphasis really, the other stuff was just icing on the cake. Also, I am looking for manga as well, so I might check out Love Hina.. *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-01-06, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If romance is an emphasis, stuff like Full Moon wo Sagashite, Ai Yori Aoshi, Kimi ga Nozomu Eien. Older stuff like Marmalade Boy and Kimagure Orange Road are good too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I liked the first episode of D.Gray-man a lot, despite having not read the manga. The story was kind of ****** up, especially the explaination of where Akuma's come from. It's pretty obviously a shounen title. The character designs are very well done, and from watching the OP, I can't wait for the girl with bandage-bra and a open jacket to show up haha. That's sexy as hell man.<br />
<br />
Definitely gonna watch more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet another eroge adaptation. The character designs are good (i.e. the girls are all pretty and interesting to look at). I liked the humor in this episode, and the male lead is not a total waste of oxygen.<br />
<br />
Princess Feena Fam Earthlight of the Moon, and her servant have descended to Earth to live there with the family of a childhood friend. It's a high school slice of life story about their adventures with the princess.<br />
<br />
The story is along the lines of To Heart, Mahoromatic, etc. So you know what to expect.</div></div><hr />

The animation is as expected from KyoAni (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Full Metal Panic). It's flowing, constantly moving, and beautiful. The updated character designs obliterated the first of my two complaints of the original series. The non-rushed storytelling and inclusion of many of the traits in the game which make it so endearing; were what ended the second and last of my complaints.<br />

There were so many wonderful things in this anime. If you want a romance and slice of life story, watch this. Without a doubt, it is one of the highlights of the year.</div></div><hr />

Light is a high school genius who picks up a notebook, where if he writes the name of a person, the person will die. Armed with the Death Note, and his belief that the world has become rotten to the core, he seeks to destroy all evil in the world.<br />

<br />
Nearly everyone should give this one a try. The OP is unbelievable. The animation is breathtaking. The story is incredible. I don't see any real flaws in this show. The first episode is out, and man is it awesome!<br />
<br />
Light is a high school genius who picks up a notebook, where if he writes the name of a person, the person will die. Armed with the Death Note, and his belief that the world has become rotten to the core, he seeks to destroy all evil in the world.<br />
<br />
But of course, not everyone agrees with his methods. Light will face his opposition and seek to create an utopia!<br />
<br />
I can't wait for more!<br />
<br />
I'd been meaning to start reading the manga for freaking forever.  Sorry I didn't start because as the first episode was so good, I'll probably stick to the anime!  Definitely looking forward to more as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know next to nothing about this series. Other than that it's an OVA that just came out. It is a story about a brother and sister who are mages or excorcists of some sort. They hunt demons and get rid of them. There's some very fanservice in the show, but it is kind of amusing sort.<br />
<br />
The art was interesting to look at, very dark/gothic. As are the character designs. I like the talking hat that's always sleeping. It has a very mysterious feel to it, a large part due to not knowing what is going on exactly.<br />
<br />
I do recommend it to fans of supernatural anime.<br />
<br />
Negima?! (alternatively known as Pani Poni Dash 2 B<br />
<br />
I have a hard time giving it a better grade. First off, I advise against Mahora's sub of Negima?!, as the encoding is horribly done. Pixelization everywhere. If you can wait, let someone else sub it. I haven't seen an encoding job this horrible in the last 4 years. It's just that bad. It reminds me of the days of watching .rma... <br />
<br />
However, I don't hold that against the series itself. The animation is decent. I really don't know where to begin with the series. It's not clearly better than the first run. The animation is very odd. It's VERY confusing and disorienting, in my opinion. I don't really know how to explain this well. However, I will compare the style to Pani Poni Dash, which it's almost a clone of. In Pani Poni Dash, the storytelling style worked well because the screen was always packed with comedy, oddity, and so on. Everything had a reason, a meaning, etc.<br />
<br />
In Negima?!, it was mostly meaningless. The constant tolling of the bells, shifting perspectives, moving view, multiple different things going on at the same time for no reason, etc. It doesn't add any style in a good way. It just leaps out at you and disorients you.<br />
<br />
However, it does shine at times. I don't know if this is better than the first season, only time will tell. But I'm not too impressed, especially after their claims that it would be hundredfold better.<br />
<br />
Sasami Mahou Shoujo Club B-<br />
<br />
I will begin by saying I'm not a terribly big fan of Tenchi. I recognize it's merits, but it never really pulled me in. The character designs in Tenchi are a big put off for me. Or at least, the hair is. As such, I've only seen Tenchi Universe.<br />
<br />
That being said, I thought the show was only slightly better than mediocre. There's really no comparision between this and modern Mahou Shoujo series (i.e. Pretty Cure). The animation is average, and the story felt abstract. There was no clear purpose to the series, which seems to have a purpose. So by halfway through, I felt a sense of pointlessness, as though it was all over the place instead of going in a clear direction.<br />
<br />
Sasami was my favorite character of Tenchi Universe, so I did enjoy seeing her again, but that's all that made me last the whole episode instead of dropping it.</div></div><hr />

The show is an strange one. It takes place in a small village. A older brother and younger sister live together alone without their parents. The older brother is a working man, the younger sister just entering middle school. It appears to be a slice of life story. The two have friends of the opposite sex of about the same age, who are also siblings.  An older sister and younger brother.<br />
<br />
One of these days I will remember names. :)<br />
<br />
An old friend of the older brother suddenly shows up in their lives, and they appear to have had a turbulent past. The show has a somewhat mature feel to it, however, there are some pretty immature parts to it. It's probably a more adult slice of life story.<br />
<br />
Tokimeki Memorial C-<br />
<br />
It's an cliche of cliche high school romance harem story. The Tokimemo franchise is very well known, dating back to the 80's, and this show is based on a MMO version of the series.<br />
<br />
It has some parodies to the MMO game, such as the accessories of the characters. However I found all the people very bland and cliche, with no twist to keep you watching. The only thing If ound amusing in the series is the baby chicken. <br />
<br />
Only the big high school romance folks will enjoy this one, for the most part.<br />
<br />
Red Garden B<br />
<br />
The show revolves around some high shcool girls who lost their memories of the day before, and as if guided by a supernatural hand, meet up late at night in a out of the way place for a reason they don't understand. They learn that something happened to them the day before, and they are to be trained to fight some sort of supernatural beings. <br />
<br />
The first episode does not say much, but the artwork is well done and there's an mysterous draw into what is going on. So I found this enjoyable. Until the next episode, however, I can't really say what direction the show is taking.</div></div><hr />

Shounen fans pay attention. This show is pretty good for the first episode. The action was interesting, and the comedy element was pretty good. Their use of alchemy was interesting. The other Alchemy Arms user, Tokiko, is awesome. She has blades attached to her legs that move like a spider's leg. For some reason, the scar on her face is sexy, heh.<br />
<br />
It has the makings of a shounen show. You know how they all begin, new guy, suddenly getting strong due to an unknown power, they improve over the series, etc. But this one was actually enjoyable to see. It'd be hard for people to not compare this with Fullmetal Alchemist, but it's pretty different.<br />
<br />
And, well, what happens to the main character in the first few seconds of the story is kind of a pathetic highlight for him to begin on! I was laughing really hard.</div></div><hr />

Have I ever given a F before? I'm not sure. I don't think so. But this deserves it, in my opinion. It's generic, shallow, pointless, useless, badly animated, and just really crappy.<br />
<br />
It feels like NOBODY put any effort in the show at all. I was waiting for some catchphrase of &quot;haha, we were kidding!&quot;<br />
<br />
Why is WinD subbing this? Beats me. Everyone has no depth at all. The girls are just clones of each other. There are 12 girls, in two groups of 6, identical toe ach other (i **** you not). God, this is horrendous.<br />

It's a post-war scenario, where many veterans became bandits, nobility is evil, etc, and a special group called Pumpkin Scissors gets created to thwart those evil people. What does it mean to be a man? To take on a tank with a single gun, that's what!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-15-06, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ghost Hunt B-<br />
<br />
This was an interesting show. It's about ghost hunters (stating the obvious!). They have various ghost hunters such as Exorcists, Scientific ghost hunters, Miko (Shrine Maidens), Spirit Channelers, and the like. They gather in a abandoned school building to find a ghost that's said to reside there.<br />
<br />
In the school, there is a girl who claims to be able to see spirits. All the other professional ghost hunters are dismissing her as an attention-whore.<br />
<br />
They are all competing to find the ghost before the other does. It's kind of interesting, since it shows all the different religious lines. I'm not sure what kind of direction it's going (a competition? teamwork? defeat the monster? :p ) so I'm holding further judgement until later.<br />
<br />
Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru B+<br />
<br />
I was looking forward to this show. The story revolves around a guy who had to go to an all-girls school because it was in his grandfather's will (take a really, really, really long suspense of disbelief, enough to last about 13 episodes....). Despite the moronic reason, that's not the focus of the show. There's a fair amount of fanservice in this show, and you will certainly question your sexuality... so just do yourself a favor and pretend he's a girl, like I do.<br />
<br />
Mizuho (the guy) is learning how to act like a girl. He apparently has fake breasts that are sensitive to touch? Lol. The show is mostly about him adjusting and living in the school. This is based on a eroge. I'm presonally going to keep watching this.<br />
<br />
Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge C+<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what to think of this series. First of all, the premise. There are five bishounens (pretty boys) living in a mansion, and in order to get better rent, they need to turn the owner's daughter into a fine lady.<br />
<br />
When the owner's daughter arrives, she's a creeeeepy, ugly, pimply faced girl. She keeps mannequins of atanomy bodies (skeletons, muscles, organs, etc) in her room and talks to them. She watches horror movies. Her clothes are abysmal.<br />
<br />
The bishounens, used to being fawned over by girls, are put at a loss. If they don't help her, their rent triples! (These guys have a hard time affording food, and they can afford rent in a mansion? Oh yeah, suspense of disbeleif)<br />
<br />
While the show itself is fairly funny, the bishounens will take some getting used to. They are the ugliest bishounens I've ever seen. Their lips are weird, their clothes are disgusting, the one who looks like a tomboy girl ends up looking like a disgusting version of cutting a girl's head off and placing it on a boy's body, instead of the traditional making the guy's body look feminine.<br />
<br />
But hey, I'm far from the target audience! I'm no fujoshi. The humor is pretty good and enough for me to keep watcing some more.<br />
<br />
Happiness! B+<br />
<br />
I'm totally biased in this show. The rating is lower than I'd actually personally give it. It's an A in my book, for now. Why? I'm a total Jun lover. Jun is one of the greatest &quot;female&quot; characters ever created. Too bad Jun is mostly a supporting character, maybe I can hope for a second season, RePure?! Nah, I'll keep dreaming.<br />
<br />
On to what I think... The show is a harem romance. The twist is the girls are magicians, Jun's a man dressed like a girl. Jun aside (who is a big scene stealer in the game, as well as the first episode so far) the story is fairly cliche, the boy saves the girl from being bullied as a kid, they meet up when they are older.<br />
<br />
There really is no use reviewing titles like this since they are always pretty much the same, with a few exceptions. I enjoyed it a lot and am going to keep watching.<br />
<br />
Sumomomomomomo C+<br />
<br />
On a techincal level, Sumo is not that good of a show. It's also another show I'd rate higher on my personal biases. It's a total lolicon's show, so beware.<br />
<br />
A girl raised by one of the strongest martial arts families finds out she cannot become any stronger because she's a girl. Disappointed that she can't master the ultimate move, her and her father deciede to marry him to the strongest male martial artist, from another family.<br />
<br />
The guy turns out to be a Law School geek. He gave up martial arts as a kid, and decieded to become an Lawyer. When she finds this out, she doesn't believe it, and believes that he is keeping his true strength hidden. But really, all she wants is for him to **** her.<br />
<br />
Seriously.<br />
<br />
She just wants his genes to give birth to the strongest child. /cue bizzaro harem romance<br />
<br />
Lots of average shows this season, only two really shine so far (Kanon and Death Note). But plenty for me to watch.</div></div><hr />

I dunno, it wasn't that confusing, but I've also read the manga. I thought the style was somemwhat similar to the manga, and actually enjoyed the jumping around. It made it much more interesting than the first run of the series, which I couldn't stand. Way too long and boring with nothing actually happening. My main complaint is the opening and the variance from the manga. I don't mind the variance all that much, but it seems like they already made plot holes for themselves just in the first 2 episodes. The opening is just horrible, crappy song, bad animation, makes all the girls out just to be numbers and doesn't say their names .etc</div></div><hr />

Yet another eroge adaptation. The character designs are good (i.e. the girls are all pretty and interesting to look at). I liked the humor in this episode, and the male lead is not a total waste of oxygen.<br />
<br />
Princess Feena Fam Earthlight of the Moon, and her servant have descended to Earth to live there with the family of a childhood friend. It's a high school slice of life story about their adventures with the princess.<br />
<br />
The story is along the lines of To Heart, Mahoromatic, etc. So you know what to expect.<br />

<br />
It's actually a pretty good series. The twist was confusing so I was sort of lost for a bit, because it seemed to come out of nowhere. The story is about a working man and his little sister (about 10ish years old) who were living together. A old romance of the man's came back and some magicial twist happens.<br />
<br />
Afterwards the show is mostly about how they live their lives after the change happens. It's hard to tell what happens as it's not in the sysnopis or even alluded to, so I'll spoiler it. This twist happens in the end of first or second episode so if you are not convinced to watch it, you may want to read the spoiler to find out whether you want to see it for certain or not.<br />
<br />
The little sister makes a wish to become an adult while the old girlfriend was near her, and soon after that, the little sister becomes an adult and the girlfriend becomes a little girl.<br />
<br />
All in all, it's a pretty decent show.<br />
<br />
Bartender D+<br />
<br />
It's only the first episode, sure. But it was one of the most boring first episodes ever. I was trying to stay awake through it the whole time. And I wasn't sleepy to begin with! Maybe it's because I dont go to bars or drink alcohol (never tasted it before either) that I'm totally missing it...<br />
<br />
But it's basically where the bartender makes a beer that saves someone's life. Someone's going through a hard time, he tells his story to the bartender, the bartender gives him a drink, upon drinking it, he is enlightened to the path he must follow.<br />
<br />
By the way, in case you didn't know.... (definition parahrpased from the show) the Bar is the stool which you sit on, and tender is gentleness... a Bartender brings the two together, and so kindness is born&quot;<br />
<br />
-_-<br />
<br />
Busou Renkin C+<br />
<br />
It's average for a shounen fighting anime. A boy is given a new life and becomes an alchemic warrior. He and his partner, a young girl with a slash scar on her face, try to battle homonoculi that eat humans.<br />
<br />
That's really all there is to it right now. The lack of insight into future possibilities really doesn't do it good, as it only feels like a tournament style anime where you just fight and move up and fight until you get to the big bad boss, unlike Naruto and One Piece which would actually have a story.<br />
<br />
You could say the show is similar to Bleach, at least the first few episodes are.<br />
<br />
Code Geass A<br />
<br />
I was pleasantly suprised by this one. But it's definitely not for everyone. A lot of people will be offended by the theme of the show. In this world, the Great Britannica Empire (i.e. us) are evil corrupt beings who invade Japan and took away everything it held dear - their freedom, their traditions, and even their name. Japan was renamed to Area 44.<br />
<br />
And so, Japan fights back against us evil people! Of course, that means super robots. What else could it be :)<br />
<br />
However, there's a twist. A young boy (Lelouch) met a girl while trying to escape, and was given a power that nobody understood. To put it simple, it's a power not unlike Light of Death Note. By looking at someone in the eye and using his power, he can temporarily make orders of the person. Even if it's to make them kill themselves or others.<br />
<br />
Lelouch is also a genius kid who is trying to manipulate the rebellion against the britannica empire.<br />
<br />
Galaxy Angel Ru~ne C<br />
<br />
It was a senseless show. It wasn't bad, it's just disposable humor. A good way to pass the time. The show revolves around a bunch of girls who are space police officers and their daily anatics. Which involves a machochist bad guy who is in charge of millions of ships and can destroy the world and all that, but he really just wants the girls to lock him up and punish him. The harder they punish, the better~<br />
<br />
So if you want cute girls, mildly amusing events, and entertainment to pass the time, this is it.<br />
<br />
Gift ~eternal rainbow~<br />
<br />
This was actually an interesting one. The main guy is pretty cool and knows what he wants. (i.e. decisive) A bunch of girls are all over him, and his non-blood related little sister comes back. He, of course, in the glorious Japanese way of greeting, (ep 3 spoilers)<br />
<br />
Confesses his love to his little sister<br />
<br />
So if you're looking for something similar to Da Capo, this is one.<br />
<br />
more to come later...</div></div><hr />

 Well, they both were making a wish at the same time, it would be logical to assume, but less logical for wish made by a small girl having a side effect, like turning an adult to a child.</div></div><hr />

I do agree on that part. It would be logicial, but since they haven't really gotten into Shouko's side of things (wish, her feelings, etc) I didn't want to jump to conclusions.</div></div><hr />
