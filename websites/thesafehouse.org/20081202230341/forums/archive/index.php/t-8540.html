He desires two more books to go with the four already brought to him - the Sanguine Tome from the heart of the temple of Cazic Thule and the Spellbook of Velketor the Sorceror.<br />
<br />
I am not really familiar with the first four books in the quest and the Oracle doesn't like my main very much so I don't plan on talking to him (and halflings don't wear robes anyhow).  It may be possible to get some more information from Sir Artanis with &quot;I received your summons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good luck I am curious how this will turn out for some lucky caster.<br />
<br />
Also was wondering about the status of the second quest with the shadowmen after one of their camps was removed from Innothule.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
(From the guy who was rather fond of the first one,even if the second one was a so-so result)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Narith</div><div class="date">03-16-03, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first 4 require the pally epic books and only resulted in a qeust to gain an oracle robe which people discovered all you had to do is kill him to get. This may have changed since it seems Sony has been finishing and revamping old quests. He also required a book from a neriak quest, and I forget what the 4th book was.<br />
<br />
The Sanguine Tome drops in the CT maze and is a droppable item just fyi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Folanlron</div><div class="date">03-16-03, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the pally epic stuff he just want's &quot;The Book of Scale&quot;<br />
<br />
which originally came from a quest from Neriak, hand one of the bartenders Torn Frost/Burnt books and 1kpp and you get the combined book back.<br />
<br />
quest has been changed you now turn in the books + money to a woman outside of Qeynos Gates, in the newbie area~<br />
<br />
You get Miragul's Phylactery(sp?) back from turnin in the book to him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
actually the quest has not been changed, just enhanced. You still can turn in your halves in Neriak, but why should a Paladin work on his Neriak faction? So, SoE made this part of the quest easier and added a scribe to Qeynos. By the way, she is triggered by talking to Kanthurn in Rathe Mountain, just in case someone needs to know. She will pop in the eastern corner in front of the gates and wander around.<br />
<br />
So, now - do the 2 mentioned books work when you try to give them to the Oracle? I'm asking just because he is not asking for those books, but for 'the book of scale' and 'the book of turmoil'. And i would hate to spend 10k+ for Velketor's Spellbook and it does not work...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Folanlron</div><div class="date">03-17-03, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you currently turn in the Frost/Burnt books into the woman in Neriak, she say's that she will not be able to do this any longer, and that there is another woman somewere who is able to combine the books for the same small fee.<br />
<br />
It was suppose to be faded out, but I'm guessin the change was made before the NPC's would give back items for quest's they don't do, and the NPC was long forgeten(sp?) yadda yadda yadda<br />
<br />
when you turn the books into the scribe +1kpp you get back &quot;The Book of Scale&quot; the book was torn apart the scribes are there to put them back together to turn into Oracle in OOT, when turned into the oracle Paladins get &quot;Phlacytery(sp?) of Miragul&quot; which we turn into the &quot;Lich of Miragul&quot; In everfrost peaks for, our epic quest.

The quest items were not changed though and the letter she gives out tells you that she will do the combine...<br />
I am still some levels away to get the two halves off the dragons   So I still thought the woman in Neriak would do the combine...</div></div><hr />

LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morgrist</div><div class="date">04-14-03, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm. This one's not so straightfoward as the others-a lot of interesting bits in the flavor text (like the Sanguine Tome having a recipe for blood ink?) but maybe you can get the text out of the Oracle here.<br />
 <br />
You could try &quot;I desire the fifth lesson.&quot;, or &quot;I desire the robe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or maybe &quot;Tell me the final book you seek.&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No answer to any of those three phrases, and just noticed that my Sanguine Tome got lost to trade bug on Sunday, waiting to hear back from the GM on it =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">04-16-03, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GM reimbursed Tome, gave it and Velk's Spell Book to Oracle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no need for this item, you can have it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll buy the stupid GMs guide and see if I can figure something out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Loriwen</div><div class="date">05-05-03, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is from Sword and Sorcery's forum on the EQRPG website.  A player was asking about info from the new Befallen sourcebook and the response was:<br />
<br />
Quote: Sorry, but the online related items are running late. I'm <br />
working out a schedule with the good people at SOE and <br />
will be able to tell you more about implementation soon. <br />
The main reason for the delay is that the GMG-connected <br />
quest is still not running, and that's because it's HUGE. <br />
It's a combination trade skill quest and regular quest. <br />
Ready to make a phylactery online??!! <br />
<br />
<br />
So, yeah, apparently this is a quest, it's just not functioning correctly, yet.  Also, in the back of the Befallen book, there's a little note at the bottom where they confirm that, yes, there are quests in each of the books that will relate to quests in the game.  I went back and read each book to find these stories.  One talks about a wand of the burning dead upgrade with Opal Darkbriar.  Another involves a rogue talking to a shadowed man in Mistmoore.  The one in the Befallen book talks about defeating the true lord of Befallen with special daggers and a phylactery.<br />
<br />
If you're quest happy, then check out the books next time you're at your local dealer for better info that what I've listed here.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">05-07-03, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first two quests you mentioned have been solved, with moderate rewards...I have my toon camped at the Oracle's feet holding the two tomes he asked for, so I hope this goes live soon =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Loriwen</div><div class="date">05-08-03, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you link to any sites or specific threads that have info on the two quests that have already been solved.  All I can find is that the Wand of the Burning Dead is listed as incomplete and that people have only completed it by petitioning that it is broken.  Does anyone have info on the supposed next step in the quest to make the &quot;True&quot; wand?  As for the other, I spoke with Ssynthi, but he responded to none of the text as listed in the book, except for the last line.  So, I have the Cauldron of Shadow Essence.  I haven't started to hunt the shadowed men or the named guy he mentions, yet, but I also haven't found any posts about anyone who has completed that, either.  Please link if you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">05-09-03, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't find the info, they were both solved on these boards but appear to have fallen off now.<br />
<br />
First one involved killing mobs near the ZI on Unrest until a ghost spawned, then you gave him the text that was in the book and he gave you a no rent bridle with one charge of summon horse (was a lowest speed white horse) to take his note to either Freeport or Neriak and he also gave you a brooch if you did another bit of text to take to his father in Felwithe. Note gave faction and exp (and you got a rentable one-charge horse bridle if you turned the no rent one into the NPC) and the brooch to Felewithe gave you an &quot;Arrialla's Token&quot; that was AC3, STR/CHA/INT/WIS 3.<br />
<br />
The second one involved, as you figured out, getting the cauldron and then finding the shadowed men (who were a stupid rare spawn sometimes-I killed the Neriak ones for nearly 8 hours straight without it popping, then again I killed the Kithicor ones once and it popped on the respawn).They were differentiated by the fact that they were SKs, HTd, and dropped a &quot;Vial of Shadow&quot;, LORE, No Drop and each of the eight identified with the name of the zone that it dropped in. Combined all 8 in the cauldron, turned it in and got a really crappy INT caster-only reward with like 2 charges of +100 mana or something lame like that. Never got around to finishing that one because of the insane long camps, but I kept the three vials I got to drop, just in case this part ever became nessicary for a later one.<br />
<br />
And you can see above what I've done so far on this new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Heartsong Steelsoul</div><div class="date">05-22-03, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, on allakhazam's it seems like people are confused about what the book is.  In the Freeport book (I think it was, or the Befallen one) they give a name for the book, and say it's being brought from the Temple of Sol Ro to Befallen, or vice versa.  It was Scriptures of the Burning Dead, I think. (Sorry, I'm at work and I don't bring gaming books to work!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Loriwen</div><div class="date">06-16-03, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having checked out the new Everfrost book, it seems the next part of this little adventure has the players heading North.  After crafting a phlactery as taught by the Oracle and making the gold runed blades, Marnek's spirit is imprisoned said phylactery.  Then, the adventurers headed to Everfrost to fight Miragul.  The protagonist of this little excerpt thinks that by forcing the two spirits into one phylactery they will destroy each other.<br />
<br />
How this will actually play out as a quest, we'll have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
And that is if they ever get moving on the stuff they still haven't implemented.  They may even make it part of the LDoN expansion.<br />
<br />

*BZZZZT* <br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
An example? Sure. The final step of the 'Heavenfall's Begirding' quest for forglok wizards. The quest-giver ports you from Innothule to Dreadlands, and then a giant fire-elemental is spawned there for you to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arctura Silvermist</div><div class="date">06-17-03, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">'Hail, Reyia Beslin' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'Greetings, Bodi . I am Reyia Beslin of the Ashen Order. I help to train our members and I am in charge of handing out the orange and red Sashes of Order. Would you like to know [how you can get an orange sash]? Or maybe you think you are ready to earn the [red sash]? <br />
<br />
'I am ready for the red sash' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'So, you think you are skilled enough to earn the red Sash of Order, Bodi ? I have just the [task] for you then. But be warned, this will be the toughest challenge you have faced yet. There are many legends and myths of great heroes and ancient evils from all over Norrath. Here in Freeport, we get travelers from all over the world, and we get their tales as well. The point is that most of these stories are just that, stories and fairy tales. Told to amuse people and frighten children. I also thought the tales I'd heard about the [Marnek Jaull] were only legends, but now I know better. <br />
<br />
'Who is Marnek Jaull?' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'Marnek Jaull led a cult of necromancers who followed the Burning Prince, Solusek Ro. He built an army, known as the Burning Dead, and spread destruction and fire throughout Antonica. Over the years, the Burning Dead fought many fierce and bloody battles with the paladins of Prexus, the Oceanlord. Though Marnek achieved many victories over the paladins, ultimately they were able to defeat him and destroy the Burning Dead. Legends say that before his defeat, Marnek created many powerful weapons and items, and wrote many books on his findings in the areas of magic. Many of these items were hidden away from the paladin forces, and remain untouched, waiting for Marnek's return, as the legends go. <br />
<br />
'What task?' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'I've heard a few legends of a powerful wand that Marnek himself used to wield. This was known as the wand of the Burning Dead, and was rumored to instill its owner with mystical energies. The legends I have heard all differed on the wand's creation and powers, but the basic story was always the same. I will [tell you the legend] if you like. The task I have for you is to bring me the two parts that make up the wand of the Burning Dead, before they can be assembled and used for evil once again. Bring me [Marnek's wand] and the [Sapphire of Souls], along with your orange sash, and you will have proven yourself a loyal member of the Ashen Order, worthy of receiving the red sash. <br />
<br />
'I would like you to tell me the legend' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'The legend of the wand of the Burning Dead goes basically like this, though you may hear slighty different versions from others. Marnek did a lot of experiments and created an unknown number of diabolical artifacts and weapons. One of his creations was this wand. Marnek fashioned a charred wand from the scorched bone of a paladin of Prexus, and Solusek Ro himself created the wretched Sapphire of Souls. Then, Marnek and his priests combined these, with the Burning Prince's blessing, to create the wand of the Burning Dead. Marnek used this Wand and its powers in his evil and destructive reign over Antonica. Years later, as Marnek starting losing battles to the paladins of Prexus, one of his own followers, a necromancer named Kenox, was able to steal the wand. Sensing Marnek's defeat, Kenox made his way toward Odus, hoping to strike a deal with the paladins for the wand. Would you like me to [tell you about Kenox]? <br />
<br />
'I would like you to tell me about Kenox' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'Well, Kenox was not as sly as he liked to think he was. Marnek knew full well what he was up to, but let him continue with his plans. Kenox had arranged to meet with two paladins late one nght on a small island in Erud's Crossing, a place that would be considered neutral ground. Sir Toran Neshal, leader of the paladins, knowing the power of the wand, was certainly not going to make any deals with a servant of Solusek Ro, and definitely not foolish enough to take any chances with this mission. Imagine the look on Kenox's face when a ship carrying more than 25 paladins, including Sir Toran, arrived at the small island! The paladins immediately captured Kenox and the wand, and headed back to Erudin. Would like me to [tell you what happened to Toran]? <br />
<br />
'What happened to Toran?' <br />
<br />
Reyia Beslin says 'Below the deck of the ship, Toran and his men questioned Kenox and carefully inspected the wand. Toran ordered one of his men to pick up the wand and try to identify its true powers. The man picked up the wand, but was unable to decipher its magic. He handed it to Toran, just as Marnek and Solusek had hoped, and the wand exploded, instantly incinerating the ship and everyone aboard, and lighting up the night sky with a giant fireball. Marnek's plan had succeeded. With the help and blessing of the Burning Prince, they had destroyed Sir Toran and an entire squad of Prexus' finest paladins. Years later, though, the paladins were able to regroup and ultimately defeat Marnek. The wand of the Burning Dead was destroyed and gone forever. Or least, that's what we thought. This wand must never be allowed to be made whole again.</div></div><hr />

I do remember people talking about it being broken,however.<br />
 <br />
They added a new shadowed man in Rathe Mountains,apparently recently. Name of Ytyrs. Kill it,and it respawns meaner still with a pack of minons. Kill the new spawn (Ytyrs the Reborn) and it drops a vial of shadow. Believe this was the replacement for the Innothule shadowed men vial that used to drop there.<br />
<br />
Also,due to an unpleasant youth I'm KOS to the Oracle. Anyone drop by lately?<br />
