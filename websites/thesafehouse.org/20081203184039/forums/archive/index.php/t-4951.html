Didnt really wanna do too much Crit cause I wanted to be different. Besides, dual all the time looks badass!! was thinkin of mor or less 50 dual, 50 venom, and mebe 40 so stealth with at lesat 25 thrurst (for extra damage) am I skewed?should I quit now? wanted super poison guy kinda. But as I read posts I gettin disheartened. did I do something wrong!?!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ciardha Sidhe</div><div class="date">03-11-02, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might be crazy, sure... but what the heck.  Live crazy.<br />
<br />
Some things to consider...<br />
<br />
You're going to be relying on your weapons and styles for damage.  High level poisons are nice, but they don't contribute anywhere near as much as high level weapon spec.  You want to take thrust to 50, because - whether you know it or not - you want Dragonfang.<br />
<br />
Also, if you're more-or-less ignoring Critical Strike, you don't need anything like 40 stealth.  Stealth for you will be a convenience, not a necessity.<br />
<br />
Think about something like 50 Thrusting (styles + maximum weapon damage), 50 Dual Wield (styles + maximum chance for double swing), 40 Envenom (very good poisons, items + rank may get you to 50), 25 Stealth (enough to climb walls), and leftovers get you 5 Critical Strike (enough to pop bladeturn from behind).<br />
<br />
You're basically a full offensive mercenary.  You lose chain armor, protect skills, parry, and the better fighter tables for HP and melee.  You get really good evade, poison, and basic hiding.  It should work. Ciardha Sidhe, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br />

whats that supposed to mean?  <br />
<br />
Your comment bout the mercs led me ta thinkin bout how much I wish mercs had stealth, badly, they need something to make up for their suckiness, and that would probally do it. what? the only thing they can do is throw sand in the enemys face every 30 MINUTES!?! something needs to be done, speccially cause of next patch with the whole 35% damage redux thats supposed to make battles last longer. I really feel for these guys. nother point of interest, ive heard that this patch will more or less kill off archers and assasins, Im worried, plus I need to know if my above spec templete will do crap.   The future is now, and Im worried.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">03-12-02, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think you are making a mistake not keeping your weapon skill at least as high as your DW. With low weapon skill you will do crap damage. Add high DW to that and you will do crap damage 50% more often. =)<br />
<br />
I have a briton who is level 12. Right now he has 10 slash, DW, and envenom. He does just as good as my main inf did at that level. Am waiting until he is in his 20s before making any concludions on him.<br />
<br />
I don't have a template in mind yet for my briton. All I know is I don't plan on putting points in CS for a long time. Maybe never. I might give him the BS 2 chain. Dunno yet. =)<br />
<br />
Since you may want to know my briton right now is in all blue equipment. (crafted tanned siluric and crafted iron hand axes) He can solo up to low yellows with no poison; with poison high yellows are pretty easy. Non-ideal mobs even. Like I said though my main inf was about the same in his low teens.</div></div><hr />

whats that supposed to mean?It means I haven't tried it, so I don't really know.   <br />
<br />
In theory, theory and practice are the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hedgewig</div><div class="date">03-12-02, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay, so I gotta bring dual AND thrust up to 7 next level? i've probally already screwed myself.  <br />
who knows I might manage, but I'll try to get em up there, thanks for help!</div></div><hr />

I gotta know<br />

<br />
I use my xbow lots. So nice to be able to pull.<br />
<br />
If you find yourself hurting for spec points ignore stealth for a bit. You don't need any stealth until you go RvR. Heck, you don't NEED stealth in RvR even; wouldn't reccomend not having it though. =)</div></div><hr />
