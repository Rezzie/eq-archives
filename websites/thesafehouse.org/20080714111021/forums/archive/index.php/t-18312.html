<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">04-16-05, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I do question Blizzard about some of their server transfer stuff, WarcraftRealms.com shows Blackhand having a lower population than the one selected to transfer to (I've only ever seen it at Medium, while BH is always High). When the transfers started, WoWCensus.com showed the transfer-to server having a higher population than some of the other servers that they were transferring from.<br />
<br />
These sites depend on people running the addon to collect data, so it may or may not be indicative of the whole server population, depending on exactly who chooses to use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why warcraftrealms lists how many updates they got and how long the last update was ago - so one can get a somewhat good idea about the validity of the data.<br />
<br />
If a server has an 2:1 A:H ratio, but there have been twice as many horde updates than alliance, it's easy to see that the ration most likely is even higher in Alliance's favor. On the other hand, if there was only one horde update, but 3 alliance, then horde might actually be more numberous than just 2:1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-18-05, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's too bad Blizzard doesn't offer any incentives to the outnumbered realms, like a small experience bonus or lower transaction costs in auction, to even out the realms.  The Horde seems to have a slight racial specific properties advantage, am I correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malse</div><div class="date">04-18-05, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really. Just to compare one from each side, Humans get a huge PVE bonus from the sword/mace skill bonus, whereas orcs only get it with one skill (axe). Further, orcs had the only racial &quot;bonus&quot; that could kill you, and another that only works versus some kinds of stuns. Humans get a passive combat, a passive reputation, a passive stat boost, and an active stealth detection. Slightly better for humans but nothing really unbalanced. <br />
<br />
To compare two class choicse, orcs versus dwarves as hunters, I think most people would vote for orcs pre-60, and then dwarves at 60 because of how good +Skill is when you fight things on raids.<br />
<br />
Overall the &quot;good&quot; racial abilities are fairly evenly distributed amongst everyone, but all of the really stupid ones seem to have gotten dumped on the horde (mostly on trolls). The Horde has the racial skill people bitch about the most (Will of the Forsaken) but they ignore that Gnomes have an equally annoying immunity skill in Escape Artist.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the whole, the entire game really is slanted in favor of the Alliance[1], but I think that's more a symptom of the population imbalance than a cause. Far more people were Alliance in beta, so they got a ton more feedback on quest, abilities, etc. The real problem seems to be preconceived notions about what character you want to play. <br />
<br />
<br />
[1] It seems like roughly half the interesting fights were consciously designed around cross-faction abilities, and the other half take certain Alliance-only ability combinations for granted. I'm sure it'd seem a lot more fair if Grounding Totem worked right and wasn't disabled when you need it most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">04-18-05, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meh, I'd say it's more due to other factors than the racial abilities (orcs and trolls both kind of suck, especially trolls).  Aesthetics is one.  Just take a walk around Orgrimmar (yabba dabba doo!) and then Stormwind, and then look at how EVERY horde male model is a hunchback (wtf Blizz).  The 'good guy' thing is another.  Yeah, if you follow the lore neither is really good or bad, but tell that to someone who just watched all the LotR movies and wants to play Legohlazz pwning orcs in teh face.<br />
<br />
From what friends have told me who played both sides, the alliance also have a PvE advantage in questing.  More and better quests with better rewards (both monetarily and itemwise).  Plus, alliance doesn't have to put up with the barrens (typical barrens quest:  Walk 3 miles south to talk to NPC X.  X tells you to walk 7 miles north to kill Y.  Return to X.  Now walk 5 miles west to talk to Z.  UGGGH).  I also personally think that paladins are much stronger PvE groupmates than shamans.<br />

Edit: My quest algebra sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matheren</div><div class="date">04-18-05, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd LOVE, as an Alliance, to &quot;put up&quot; with the barrens. that place is grindy, but you can level so much faster through the teens there. playing an alliance requires you to travel just as much, but you have to do a lot more travelling between cities - you can't just quest-level in westfall, so you have to go spend time in thelsamar, or auberdine.. then back to westfall.. then maybe a quest or two in redridge.<br />
<br />
I've gotten horde characters from 1-20 in the course of a weekend, takes much longer on alliance.<br />
<br />
plus, horde has ragefire - alliance has stockades, 10 levels later :/</div></div><hr />

All 3 or 4 of the &quot;hey, take a tram/zeppelin/bird&quot; to this other place quests have equivalents on both sides, just swap out Auberdine for the Sepulchre and Thunder Bluff for Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

Or hop a boat to Ratchet at lvl 12 or so.  :kroe  Makes the teens quite a different experience.</div></div><hr />

pfft so should I also turn on walk mode when I have to hunt in thelsamar or darkshore? because westfall is going to get me about three levels in the teens if I'm lucky :) that's about what it gave my warlock heh.. and like I said, that was including doing a couple quests in redridge and all of thelsamar to boot. and grinding 17-18 on dark dwarves :P<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the horde have it easier or any of that crap, since I probably like the horde more (I only play alliance because of friends). just that the barrens is absolutely the best and quickest place to level in the teens :) may suck afterwards, but at least you have that :P silverpine isn't too bad either.</div></div><hr />
