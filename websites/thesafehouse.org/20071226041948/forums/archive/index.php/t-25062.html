<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">07-03-06, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's summer, meaning that for half of every day, it's too goddamn hot to do anything but sit in the dark and watch anime. I've finished Berserk (rented, not downloaded), Naruto, Bleach, and Kimi ga Nozomu Eien are on my other computer, and my brother keeps knocking Farscape down on the Blockbuster queue because he wants to watch Citizen Kane or some dumb ****.  <br />
<br />
There's a lot of series out there.  There's also a lot of crap.  Fame doesn't always mean good, either; having loved Evangelion, and seeing that it was near the top of AnimeNfo.com's Top 200 list, I gave RahXephon a try (that it was cheap at GameStop didn't hurt).  Ugggh.  :sick  <br />
<br />
Here's the rundown on what I'm looking for:  <br />
<br />
-To give you an idea, some of my favorites are Eva, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, and Fullmetal Alchemist.<br />
<br />
-I tend to prefer shows with a limited run (26 episodes, or 51, or whatever) to those that go on forever, but it's not hard to get me to make exceptions. <br />
<br />
-Anything that continuously takes itself way too goddamn seriously (Witch Hunter Robin, the aforementioned RahXephon) gets on my nerves.<br />
<br />
-So does anything that continually hints that there's something really interesting going on, but refuses to tell you any of the interesting parts until long after I've stopped caring (WHR and RX again).  <br />
<br />
-I'm not much into girly stuff.<br />
<br />
-A heavy romantic focus is annoying.  Unless, of course, the ai in question is shounen. Or shoujo.  :naughty<br />
<br />
-Humor is good. <br />
<br />
-Straightfoward action is fine, but my holy grail is anything that can **** with my head.</div></div><hr />

Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (still running, 13? eps so far)<br />
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (season ended, 14 eps)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But if I think I understand your personality and preferences, I think you'll adore The Slayers above all else. It will probably not be the greatest anime you've ever seen, but it'll stand out as a favorite. It's basically one big RPG parody. In this franchise is:<br />
<br />
The Slayers -&gt; The Slayers Next -&gt; The Slayers Try. Then there's about 8-9 movies/ovas. Doesn't really matter which order you watch it in, but best to watch the ova's after the series as it does not matter when you watch them unless you are exceedingly anal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni  is good also...I think it messes with your head a lot if you try to make sense of it all.<br />
<br />
Just to note Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is not even close to girly stuff...pretty much some hard core fed up killin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">07-04-06, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Full Metal Panic! and Rune Soldier are also a couple good anime which would fit your criteria.</div></div><hr />

Possibly the best longer anime series I have seen</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think we Rec. Monster b4 but was not liked...<br />
<br />
But ya Monster is one of my all time fav anime series...the ending just blows your mind lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-05-06, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You recc'ed Monster to me and I didn't like it after having seen a few eps... maybe it get's better after the first few, but I wasn't interested in it much.. too much other good stuff to watch first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">07-08-06, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I've seen a couple episodes of Monster at anime club and I liked it.  <br />
<br />
Slayers...ah, man.  That was one of the first anime series I ever saw.  Part of it, at least.  If there's an award for greatest episode title ever created by man, Escape! Noonsa, the Flaming Fish Man should get it.  Man, I need to get me some more of that.  <br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni is what I ended up going with.  So far I like it a lot.  I just finished watching episode 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
.....hold me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">07-08-06, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slayers all 3 Seasons is one of my favorites.<br />
<br />
Get Backers<br />
<br />
<br />
Monster, I gave it a fair 15 episode shot. Dropped it. Guess it is not for me, last 5 eps I watched forcibly, by 15 I just couldn't take it.</div></div><hr />
