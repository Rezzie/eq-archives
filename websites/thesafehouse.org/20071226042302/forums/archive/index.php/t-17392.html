Not like it'll be hard to find fansubs of it, anyway. Don't get your panties in a bunch.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
Well i'm glad it is Viz at lest. But yay for the makers of Naruto for getting licensed finally heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.. I dunno.  I almost would have PREFERED 4kids to do it, as in all likelihood Funi would have been able to do uncut/subbed releases.  With Viz we're going to have them mimicking the translations used in their manga US translations, which I'm really not fond of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have much experience with Viz releases, but they seemed to do good with Excel Saga and Neon Genesis Evangelion. I mean, I am fully aware they will probably release it in a low ep/disc format, but that doesn't particularly bother me because that also means a high quality / no-loss video quality.<br />
<br />
Although I would also have liked Funimation to do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have much experience with Viz releases, but they seemed to do good with Excel Saga and Neon Genesis Evangelion.<br />
Viz did the manga for those two, but the anime went to ADV.  Viz doesn't have a whole lot of video licenses (http://www.viz.com/products/video/), but I don't have any complaints about what I've seen of their library (Inuyasha and Key).  I'd give them the benefit of the doubt here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing about Viz is that they are incredibly spotty.  Some of their work is fantastic and exemplary.  Other things they get a little too &quot;adaptive&quot; with and start crossing lines that throw fans into hissies.  And then there are the things that they simply adhere to by policy that irritates fans (rarely if ever subtitle song lyrics, low ep counts, etc).<br />
<br />
But when they do things right, it's some of the best produced stuff out there.  Their Kenshin manga english adaptations are superbly handled.  In fact most of the manga I buy right now is published by Viz, which is only going to increase with the impending release of the 20th Century Boys manga (which could very well be my favorite manga ever), and the I&quot;s manga.<br />
<br />
I'm gettign off topic though.  Unfortunately their Naruto manga has NOT been one of their 'good' titles.  Prepare for Bunshin no Jutsu and Kage Bunshin no Jutsu to both be genericly referred to as &quot;Art of the Doppleganger.&quot;  No more Sexy no Jutsu, it's now &quot;Ninja Centerfold.&quot;  This is just the beginning.  I gave them 4 volumes to get things right and gave up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing that will influence how much it's changed is what's it being targeted for.<br />
<br />
If it's being targeted for CNs maguzi/toonami demographic then we're screwed.  Even targeting it for the Adult Swim crowd will require some big changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I knew how their manga is. I have all of the Kenshin thus far, and it probably is one of my favorite title translations. I knew about the Naruto manga as I have a Shonen Jump subscription.<br />
<br />
I had forgotten how awful the Naruto manga translation was. Upon further thought, a cash cow title like Naruto, they won't even bother to respect the wishes of the &quot;hardcore&quot; fans.<br />
<br />
So I'm not as hopeful as I was, anymore. Then again, Naruto will probably be the anime that defines whether or not Fansubs should continue to exist or not. Theoretically, at least 20,000 people should buy the first volume. I'm betting on it should be at least 30,000.<br />
<br />
But if Fansubs have any effect on how much of Naruto is bought, it may fall in the 10k mark or under.<br />
<br />
I don't have any actual knowledge on the amount of people who watch Naruto, I am just going off by how there's usually ~5,000 people downloading it on the first day, so over time I assumed it would peak around 20,000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyorg</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I'm not terribly sadened.  I'm on like 117 or such, but it seems to have been going down hill.  My brother read the manga and said pretty soon her it's going to get stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, yeah, it goes DBZ...<br />
<br />
Still, despite knowing how stupid it is, for some reason it feels like I can't stop reading now, especially at this point in the manga (I don't really want to spoil it, but anyone who read 245+ knows what I refer to).<br />
<br />
Hopefully, the Atasuki arc will make things interesting. But, as long as it can be my token &quot;mindless action&quot; anime, I'm fine with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm happy that I'll be able to buy Naruto on DVD now, and at the same time, I'm happy my favorite Naruto fansubber is going to continue to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">02-16-05, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah a friend and I had decided that Naruto had kinda jumped the shark a while back, but now that the &quot;second part&quot; of the manga has started things seem to be looking up.  Can't wait to see what happens with Akatsuki/Oro/Sasuke now.  As long as he can stay on story even marginally things should be reasonable.</div></div><hr />

AnimeSuki Not Considering Naruto Licensed (2005-02-16 04:58:41)<br />
AnimeSuki has stated on their front page, &quot; AnimeSuki sees ShoPro only as a middle-man and not an anime company which releases anime themselves. As such we're not marking it licensed yet.&quot; ShoPro, which has acted as a &quot;middle-man&quot; in the licensing business up until now, recently announced that it would be merging with sister company Viz, LLC to form a single company handling licenses, video releases and manga releases.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thought some of you may like to know this, if you didnt already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">02-16-05, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt; Naruto licensed <br />

Press release. <br />

Seems they also are going to show One Piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-16-05, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless I'm misunderstanding you, One Piece has been airing for a while now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">02-16-05, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but so were shows like Yugioh and DBZ long before they showed up on Cartoon Network.<br />
<br />
I think he's saying that now Cartoon Network will be showing One Piece.<br />
<br />
Man, if they play One Piece and Naruto back to back, oh man, I gotta buy a sattalite dish!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">02-16-05, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It can still be toonami-fied...   :|</div></div><hr />

Ya thats what I was trying to say hehe :P.   <br />
  <br />
It can still be toonami-fied..  <br />
  <br />
That's why I hope AS gets it. Plus I think AS needs the help atm with there ratings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AS' ratings are pretty high rate now, FMA and GITS are doing very well on the action block.<br />
<br />
Toonami has Naruto now though, hopefully the late Saturday night format will give it some flexibility. It's going to be an interesting test though because if Toonami will ever do a TV-PG rating, this will be it. The cash cow that is Naruto will be quite worth it I think it, and hopefully they will too.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the edits don't worry me very much, it's not as deep and violent as alot think it is, and if it gets the 10:30 slot, I don't see much changing at all. I'm more concerned about them getting Naruto and Sakura right. Sasuke is genericly voiced enough to get right, but they obviously have to make Naruto enthusiastic and the younger crop of voice actors only come off as incredibly grating when they do this. Sakura too, younger voice actresses can be overly shrill. Oh well, I have good hopes, Viz's VA's have improved a ton recently evidenced by the newly dubbed IY episodes.</div></div><hr />

Ugh, I absolutely hate the voices in the English voices.  That and the wonky translation of some of the names.  I wasn't too impressed with its handling.<br />
<br />
Meh, to each his own, I guess.  If they screw up Naruto, though, heads are gonna ****ing roll.</div></div><hr />
