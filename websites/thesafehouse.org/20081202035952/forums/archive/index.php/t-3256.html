I have a level 3 Halfling Ranger (soon to turn thief) and I have zero spells.  The manual list spells for level 1,2,3.....    How do I get these?  Sorry if the answer is obvious, but I can't find it anywhere.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<br />
I  think you start getting your first spells somewhere around level 5 or 6.  You'd have to stay a ranger to get them though, if you change to rogue and only 3rd level as ranger you won't get them (unless you go back to ranger later on).<br />
<br />
As an example, when a cleric is cleric level 2, she still only has access to her first circle of spells.  At level 3, she gains access to her 2nd level of spells.  At level 5, she gains access to her 3rd level of spells, etc.<br />
<br />
So a &quot;3rd level spell&quot; would be gained at 5th level as a cleric.<br />
