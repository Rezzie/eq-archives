<br />
We were chatting about this in the rogue channel last night, apparently an energy tea recipe is a reward for the Westfall rogue quest. It requires 100 skill points in cooking to create it. I don't know the ingredients but I'll check out the quest myself when I get a chance.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, I don't know what level the quest is but some level 40+ people were the ones chatting about it. I'll post more later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malakie</div><div class="date">06-27-04, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hrm...  I don't really see a big use for an Energy replenishment drink unless it is instant, very fast acting, or gives you a Energy regen buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghrey_the_grim</div><div class="date">06-27-04, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually it's Thistle Tea, it comes as a quest reward a 55 Night Elf rogue in Lakeshire (not Westfall) and restores 100 energy instantly.<br />
<br />
It only has 10 uses as a reward, but... I do believe I saw someone selling the recipe for cooking or alchemy for it.<br />
<br />
If the recipe is for alchemy I'll try to get it and post my findings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">artebus</div><div class="date">07-02-04, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to Thottbot, the recipe for Thistle Tea is a reward from the poison quest. Sadly, I did the quest before the reward was added, so I now either have to level up a twink to redo the quest, or I have to find a rogue who is willing to sell theirs...<br />
<br />
As a side note, the reward for the Redridge rogue quest (the lockpicking quest) is kinda silly. It's a note that reads something along the lines of, the bearer of this note should be accorded the respect due to a first rate pilferer, but it's soulbound, so you can never show it to anyone to let them read it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">07-05-04, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just bought the recipe in the Barrens on the PVP server.  I'm a shaman, so I can't use it, but i'll be skilling up cooking now to make it, if you want some tell me with something about the Safehouse and I'll see what i can do for ya.  the name's Kamu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">07-05-04, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ghrey, the reward was definitely not a limited uses reward, it was for the recipe for the tea which required the cooking skill, it must not be the same thing that you're talking about.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm back in town, I'll get online sometime next week after catching up on stuff (I have to catch up on a LOT of stuff, hehe) and verify it myself or have the rogue who did the quest post.<br />
<br />
Thwick when you bought the recipe, was it from a player or an NPC vendor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghrey_the_grim</div><div class="date">07-05-04, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No there are actually 2 quests. One rewards you with the actual tea with 10 uses.  There is the level 16 quest from Lucius the dwarf in Lakeshire, and another from the level 55 Night elf to recover the Horns of Nez'ra from orcs.  The Horns quest gives you the thistle tea itself.<br />
<br />
At level 20 you get another rogue quest to learn poisons from Matthias Shaw in Stormwind. This takes you to a tower in Westfall that you must infiltrate  and get the contents of a box and take back to Shaw.   At the end of this quest you get the recipe for Thistle Tea.<br />
<br />
I'm about to pick up cooking myself and level it up just enough to get thistle tea. I'm Fisher on the PvP server. If you're Alliance and need some /t me and I might be able to hook you up with some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that's the one I was getting at :)<br />
<br />
I haven't created my PvP character yet (shocking but true, hehe) if I end up as Alliance I'll definitely give ye a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">07-06-04, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought it from a Horde Rogue on the PVP server, not an NPC.  And it only needs 60 skill in cooking, not 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bondori</div><div class="date">07-11-04, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got the recipe from a rogue quest in Ratchet. I don't have the specifics, but it was one of the gremlin things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenardo</div><div class="date">07-12-04, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">isn't the quest in ratchet for the tea itself a 10 use thing?<br />
<br />
(don't forget the cracker- we did)<br />
<br />
the quest for the recipe itself  comes from orgimmar and has to do with the new tower to the north of sludge fens- and the grand foreman.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">07-12-04, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm making them now,  it needs 1 Swiftthistle and 1 Refreshing Spring Water to make 1 Thistle Tea.  It's an instant 100 to Energy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vehemence</div><div class="date">01-04-05, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a few answers since I have been using this potion for some time. I should say drink since in fact you make it with cooking. It is cooking (60) atm. It is also instant. Cooldown currently is set at 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Let me know if by chance you find something different.<br />
<br />
The information on where to get it is correct as well. Keep in mind to save yourself trouble, make sure you have a bronze tube readily handy when you are doing the quest because it took me a whopping 6 hours to track one down from a &quot;craftsman&quot; that WASN'T trying to rip me off.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />
P.S. its glad to be back at the house.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bengel Tyger</div><div class="date">01-04-05, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some rogue sold his recipe for cheap.  I bought it out and got it to a herb/cook in guild cuz im sure someone (if not just this one rogue) would like to just buy the drinks.</div></div><hr />

Not sure non-rogues can even learn the recipe, have you done that yet?</div></div><hr />

Only rogues can use it tho.  Since we are the only Engergy users....and it says Rogue only.</div></div><hr />

Actually, Druids use Energy also... in Panther form.  The item does read Rogue-only though, so the poor kitties are out of luck when it comes to easy-replentishment.</div></div><hr />

All that info above is from beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-29-05, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got this recipe a couple nights ago as part of my reward for the &quot;Mission Improbable&quot; quest for the Hoarde.  It's pretty well known amoung the rogues of my level because its a rogue only quest but its elite, so it takes a group.  It climaxes with fighting your way up the big-ass tower near sludge fen.</div></div><hr />
