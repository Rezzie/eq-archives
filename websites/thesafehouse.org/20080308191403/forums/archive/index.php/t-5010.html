Virulent Fishhook (drops from Danaoin Fishermen in Lyonesse lvl 41ish mobs)  +2 envenom and other stats IIRC<br />
<br />
Some Gloves can't recall name that have +3 envenom IIRC from Llyn Barfog (I'm guessing off epic mobs)<br />
<br />
The thruster you mentioned not sure it's stats or location since I'm a slashing infiltrator.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps glad to see you tired of AO Grendl :)<br />

I tired of AO LONG ago, &amp;amp; went back to EQ, from EQ to DAOC, back to EQ, &amp;amp; now back to DAOC again. lol  Who knows how long I will last here.  I have been reading that AO is much improved over what it once was, but cannot believe it will ever be the game it should be.<br />
<br />
Oh well, thanks for your info! I need some ph@t l3wt,now I see that the stuff I want is outsideof my level range, BAH!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The weapon is the Frenzied Thruster which drops of the Needletooth Whatchamacallit in Barfog.  It's +4.  I got that info from Gambanshee.  I don't know the URL, but if you go to my guild site, there is a link to it.  You can also get there from Darkageofcamelot.com links.<br />

I've never heard of the gloves before.  I'd like some proof of their existence, I could slightly alter my spec plan depending on their bonus. Aurra Sing - 40 Infiltrator<br />

Then equip it in my main hand, to do the same with my offhand weap???  Applying poisons to both my weapons that are higher than I am spec'd for???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Brandyn Aquilius</div><div class="date">04-05-02, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you could do that.  With +2 from a fishook, and +8 from two frenzied thrusters you could take env to natural 40 and still use Lifebane.  (Yes, I know about the +5 gem from DF, but it looks like it will be HARD to get...Diamond Seals)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_MarkColwill</div><div class="date">04-09-02, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question:<br />
<br />
Lets say you have a natural 40 in envenom.  And then you equip enough items to raise your evenom to 50, allowing you to apply the level 50 poison (i.e. lifebane).  And then you remove the + env items in favor of your normal + cs or + stealth items and go hunting for an opponent.<br />
<br />
Will the level 50 poison proc on an enemy if your CURRENT envenom skill is 40?<br />
<br />
My understanding was that you needed your envenom to equal the level of the poison for both application of and delivery (i.e. proc) of the poison.  Am I wrong?<br />
<br />
Cuz if I only need to raise my envenom to 50 during the application of the poison that gives me some flexibility I didn't know I had...</div></div><hr />

So i would assume same rule applies to you. DaBuddah 23 Infiltrator<br />
