<br />
I want to get started in Alchemy but I don't even know where to find most of the first componants I need to get started, short of the Crystals.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have any luck finding sites with good proven craft info? gnmish.gearbinder.ring.warden.sullon.zek<br />

If it's like the Carpenters' guild you can talk to the workers there and they will give you some recipes and they can buff your alchemy skill for combines.<br />

I just don't know where to find them. That's the problem with every resource list I've looked at, they have the what, they lack the where.<br />

We need a website like EQTraders for FFXI.</div></div><hr />

I hear there's a big import racket running from San d`Oria to Windurst. It's bigger than the Mafia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Auction House is a HUGE ripoff for these import goods. I'm not gonna pay someone for something I would, and plan to, do to others.  <br />
<br />
Guess I need to wait till 20ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_CreepyPete</div><div class="date">11-26-03, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hear you just fine, but you're acting as if you're facing insurmountable obstacles.<br />
<br />
Facts: Grapes are 75g at the vendor iirc. Synthesis as a whole is an expensive proposition especially when you consider what stacks of crystals sell for at the AH. <br />
<br />
Options:<br />
<br />
1) Sell your stuff for ripoff prices so you can buy other stuff at ripoff prices. Hint: Kill Goblins. Lots and lots of goblins. Armor sells well.<br />
<br />
2) Make a friend in San D'oria on your server. Delivery Box is your friend.<br />
<br />
3) Check the foreign vendor stands in your city. If your city is doing well in other zones they will commonly be selling produce and what have you from other zones.<br />
<br />
4) Walk and probably die. A lot.<br />
<br />
5) Wait to do crafting until you can ride a chocobo.<br />
<br />
6) Roll up a character in San D'oria. Delivery Box is your friend.<br />
<br />
At least you HAVE an alchemist guild. I'm stuck doing carpentry or blacksmithing until I can get high enough to make the run to Bastok. Tried once this week and was dead 5 mins into the dunes at 11th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-26-03, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The elevation in price for crafting items in the auction house mainly reflects two things.<br />
<br />
1) Inevitable bar of price that is there or else it's not worth the time <br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
2) The fact that Sand'Orian carrots cost about 200gil is the price of not having to slay rabbits and pray for 20 minutes til you get enough together to have a decent pool of material. The value of stacks of those items is rather fair.<br />
<br />
My point is this. I haven't met on person able to craft above 15 skill and reasonably afford it. Theres a reason crystal stacks cost 1500 a pop. Crafting is something for later levels. Trying to craft at low levels is a waste of time, money, and effort, because everything you produce is worthless unless you spent 20-30k on materials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not having to watch yourself die slowly to poison = Priceless<br />
<br />
I dig ya Pete. I just don't know how to meet anyone in San d`Oria if I can't get there.<br />
<br />
My other problem is that the only Alchemist's Guild is in Bastok, yet another city I'm not at. Hehe.<br />
<br />
I can see this quickly becoming a non-issue until I can at least get a Chocobo.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input guys.</div></div><hr />
