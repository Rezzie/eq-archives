<br />
Read somewhere that every point of CS adds 9pts to the max dmg of a hidden attack. You're at a certain point for training 50 in CS, does it go  past that? Would I get the 45 extra max dmg points from the +5? Thanks..<br />

The Critical Strike is one of 'em. <br />
However as with creation remember the &quot;Bell Curve&quot; and the &quot;Law of Declining Returns&quot;<br />
<br />
On Creation 1st 10 points in Dex gave you +10, next 10 only 5. <br />
<br />
Under 50 each +point to CS averages +9 HP damage. <br />
Over  50 each +point averages only +2 HP damage.<br />
<br />
It appears that a much greater reward from bringing Weapon or Envenom or even DW up another point then going over 50. If you've developed a character perfectly all Prime skills would hit 50 before any hit 51. <br />
<br />
This data is from a much longer post that was in the TL Boards and Mythic Herald.<br />

I thought that each point in CS raises your MAX DAMAGE by 9 points.  That wouldn't be the same as average damage.  If it's average, the CS points are more valuable than I thought. Aurra Sing - 40 Infiltrator<br />

<br />
+9 / spec level. No CAP!<br />
<br />
Thats why lots of assassins take CS to 50.<br />
<br />
Furthermore there is no evidence that suggests the average doesn't increase as well. I suspect the effect of CS on your average damage has nothing to do with Spec Level 50 and being above or below it. The higher you are the more damage you do.  Sunthas Bayne<br />

Most you could do is 51,52 as an average player.    Sunthas Bayne<br />

<br />
So I guess with the spread of max damage it would average +4,+5.<br />
<br />
And I'm sure it was a Mythic post itself that said the reward would dramatically decrease above 50. <br />

<br />
skills useless after 50:<br />
stealth<br />
envenom<br />
pacification<br />
<br />
probably more in other realms, but those are 3 im sure of.  as far as CS over 50, I've heard from several people that it gives +9 to cap just like every other point in CS. Dither Disgustipated<br />

CS above lvl 50 does do something.<br />
With RR and Items, my avg PA does 63 more damage.<br />
That is just enough on some casters to one hit kill them.<br />
