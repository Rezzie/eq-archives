<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Osoz</div><div class="date">03-19-06, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Desert Rogues are now recruiting for Vanguard: Saga of Heroes! We are a small, casual guild that engages in all aspects of online gaming: crafting, raiding, live events, player events, etc. And despite our name we are open to all classes and races. We have been in existence since the spring of 2004 and most of us come from SWG, but our players have experience in many other mmo’s: EQ, EQ2, WoW, Anarchy Online, Matrix Online, Eve, etc.  We are mostly located throughout the central time-zone of the U.S., but we also have players from Canada, Central America, and Western Europe.  Currently, we looking to play on a PvE server but as many of our members enjoy occasional/light PvP we are hoping Sigil implements some type of PvP battlefield area on the PvE servers, otherwise I suspect some of us will experiment on the PvP servers.<br />
<br />
We are looking for mature players (no drama or unnecessary L337 speak please) but we have no age requirements. That said the majority of our players are in their 20s but we range in age from 16-40.  We have married players and players with kids as well as high school and college students and we understand that the real world takes priority over everything else.  <br />
<br />
We will carry on our tradition of a weekly guild-night – a night where everyone comes together to engage in a guild-wide activity – usually leveling, questing, raiding, etc. And while guild night is never mandatory, it is highly encouraged.  As far a being “family friendly” well I guess that’s relative. You will encounter the occasional crude word in guild chat, and while we try to self-police and refrain from vulgarities we are not language Nazis – we’re here to have fun, not to worry about offending someone’s sensibilities.  A good sense of humor is a MUST!<br />
<br />
We have a website (technically just forums) and a dedicated team-speak server.  If the Desert Rogues sound like a guild you might be interested in please check out our website at http://www.desertrogues.info and make sure to read our charter and guidelines, if you’re still interested go to our recruitment forum and apply.  We hope to see you on the forums soon!</div></div><hr />
