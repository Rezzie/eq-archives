On test right now you can no longer haste your pets in PoP.  This takes a lot away from a chanter.</div></div><hr />

I'd take it like a man, they could do worse to your charms, face it, it's on par with manaburn.<br />
<br />
In all honesty I DO hate nerfs of any kind, but like manaburn the players are forcing Verants hand to keep some balance. Bloodshard Ogg<br />

I would be able to deal with a possible haste cap on pets, but no haste with Dire Charm? WTF?! Why bother putting the AA points into Dire charm then? I'm starting to feel about as valuable as a ranger. If they make this change I will probably quit my chanter, or just quit playing EQ. <br />
<br />
Mobs that are charmed will have 1% slow to them. When a mob is slowed by any percent it can not be hasted.  This will get dire charm too from what I am reading. <br />
<br />
Also, I am seeing that the charm will be more easily resisted 35% or so?  and break earlier.  Nice Nurf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hyarth</div><div class="date">01-17-03, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its part of life.  Most enchanters I know wouldn't haste their pets anyway, as when charm broke the chanter was instantly turned into a messy red smear.  In fact, I know some chanters who feel that this isn't a bad change and could have been much worse.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are still useful and have almost always been essential.  So you're not that large source of dps now as you were with hasted pop mobs which would hit for 500+.  It is sort of like the Frozen Jebus nerf of Velious, it was simply much more dps than ever intented for pc control.  While I agree that this change perhaps should not have been universal and only affected certain zones (or spells above 60) enchanters still most certainly do play a role vital to group and raid success.  I almost never see an enchanter lfg for want of a group. <br />

It takes a lot of skill to work with these mobs because they are so dangerous.</div></div><hr />

This only affects the 63+ charm spells. DC is unaffected as is all other charm spells from 1-62. Your Sister in Arms,<br />

<br />
Unlike other classes that have had soloing ability tinkered with like wizards, mages, beastlords, etc. and now find it is more efficient to get into groups, enchanters will REALLY have a hard time with this nerf.<br />
<br />
Why? Because unlike other classes enchanters are virtually unwanted in experience groups. Seriously, have you EVER seen anyone /ooc group LF enchanter or have you every heard anyone in your group actually REQUEST an enchanter?<br />
<br />
I mean, what do enchanters have to help them find groups? Verant needs to really compensate the POOR enchanters for this one. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_HalcionENC</div><div class="date">01-17-03, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see this as a huge nerf, I'm a 65 enc with CoD.  I rarely hasted my pets when in groups or soloing.  Their dmg output was just to mean as it is.  I'd rather not have a hasted pet who could break charm any moment beating on me while I need to mez mulitple incs.<br />
<br />
And so far this nerf has only affected spells lvl 60+ according to Lucy's data and the Dire Charm effect Dominating Gaze has not been listed on Lucy's as one for the impending nerf.  Who will this hurt?  Enchanters trying to solo named mobs in BoT and other places, which I agree, we shouldn't really be able to do that.  No class should.<br />
<br />
As a whole this nerf wont impede on my class to much, will hurt the farming enchanter for the most part.  We will still be able to put out good damage, but with that comes an inheirent risk of killing yourself and the group if your not careful.  So this change is mostly for the best, enchanters shouldn't take this to heart as a hard core nerf.  We will always have our place in crowd control, as damage was a nice addition in this expansion, it was not our primary purpose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dire charm does not have a 1% slow on it.  The only charms that do, currently are:<br />
<br />
Word of Terris NEC/65  <br />
Beckon ENC/62  <br />
Command of Druzzil ENC/64  <br />
Call of the Banshee BRD/64  <br />
Command of Tunare DRU/63 <br />
Call of the Arch Mage MAG/65<br />
<br />
i.e.: any L61+ charm regardless of class.<br />
<br />
Enchanter 'dire charm' is called 'Dominating Gaze'.  It's not on this list, and a quick check of lucy.fnord.net shows it does not have a 1% slow.<br />

I get killed by my pet once or twice a night, but the xp gain makes it worth it, even taking a total party wipeout into account.<br />
<br />
After the nerf I'll give my pets two procking weapons so they dual wield.  It'll mean a drop in dps of around 30 percent though.  I wish there were a single-target +atk buff I could get for my pets other than FoN. ------------------------------------<br />
