<br />
Kamiyama Samataro, a second grader of high school, is the eldest son of God family. He is living with his father who is God, the mother who is a goddess, his sisters who are candidates for goddesses, and a help, Tenko, who is his childhood friend and an angel. They are living in a house built 25 years ago in Setagaya. The reason why they live in the human world is because they make Samataro study human world in order to become God.<br />
However, his parents make miracles without intention and everything goes as he wants. Therefore, he becomes languid and dull, and he is always scolded by Tenko.<br />
One day, he encounters a mysterious transfer student, Kumiko, and falls in love with her. He makes up his mind to make her his girl friend by himself.<br />

Anything exceptional about this show? not really. Just one of those generic Anime which doesn't suck ;p. This is judging from 1st ep.</div></div><hr />
