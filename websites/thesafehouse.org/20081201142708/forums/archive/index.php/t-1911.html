<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">10-14-03, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apple was known for having great, creative ads.  Their latest ads are not creative at all.  Rather, they are up there competing with the collect call ads in most annoying content.  <br />
<br />
The last campaign for iTunes were a series of billboards with a picture of a guitar and the words iTunes in tiny letters.  Was it supposed to be someone's guitar that I should've recognized?  No clue.  Just a guitar.  If you want to throw your money away while producing no product awareness, just give a dollar to each of the 1 million homeless people in San Francisco and they can yell about iTunes for a day.  Whatever they yell will be at least as meaningful as this magical anonymous guitar.<br />
<br />
Take the iPod.  They have a bunch of commercials with shadows of people dancing with the iPod in white.  Great.  What does that tell us.  Nothing we didn't already know.  It's two years since the iPod came out.  The iPod looks exactly the same as it used to, albeit a microscopicly bit thinner. <br />
<br />
But thanks for pointing out how crappy, cheap, and awkward the headphones are too.  Just what I wanted to see, shadows of hipsters who wear watches on leather wristbands and the kind of floppy hat Riff-Raff wore on the Heathcliff the Cat show, when they're not poppin' in the passenger seat of a mitsubishi eclipse, listening to generic public domain funk.  <br />
<br />
If Apple is trying to make their ads artistic, they suck at it.  If they're trying to sell products, they suck even worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-14-03, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Advertising execs have just gotten lazy lately. I was noticing, since Time Warner started running their &quot;Imagine what life would be like without cable&quot; commercials, you know, the &quot;Dial up won't bury joggers in my backyard!&quot; stuff, I've seen like 6 spin off commercial concepts about people, imagining all this crazy, entertaining @#%$, then a flash back to the product.<br />
<br />
Advertising isn't about extolling the virtues of a product anymore. It's about convincing people that whatever it is you are making, the image associated with that product is hipper, funnier, more clever, more contemporary, than it's competition. <br />
<br />
And yeah, the apple ads, the black and white hipsters dancing, drives me nuts too. Before you know it, there will be hipsters sitting at their 4k personal computers trying to look cool while being geeks......hey, wait a second..... &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">10-14-03, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank god for Tivo.  I just remembered the last iPod ad campaign.  Instead of protecting us from seeing the actual hipsters by hiding them behind shadows, they had them sing along to whatever song was on their iPod.  Too expensive to find a good looking actor or actress who can sing?  Just get Mike the boom operator and have him sing *edit* Superfreak.<br />

<br />
Whooowooo thanks for saying that, I been trying to remember the name of that cartoon for a week now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_lenweni</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow can anyone remember did riff-raff have 4 other cats in his gang or was it just 3 I remember the fat cat and the girl cat but I cant remember any of there names and wasnt one of the cats a stoner or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Montag McCleaud</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were 3 other cats in Heathcliff's gang.<br />
<br />
The one with the headband,  Riff-Raff<br />
The fat one, Mungo<br />
And the one with the headphones,  Wordsworth I think.<br />
<br />
The Girl cat was just his girlfriend and wasnt in the gang.  Don't remember her name though.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Sorry but I never used, owned or was interested in Apple,  so I cant comment on the rant and must resort to comments on the thread de-rail. Edited by: Montag McCleaud at: 10/15/03 11:09 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, Riff Raff was the leader of the gang, then there was the guy in the headband, Mungo, Wordsworth, and Cleo (the moll).  Heathcliff was in a separate world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaielen</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heathcliff was NOT the leader of the gang.  It was the other little cat who was the leader.  The fat cat, tall skinny cat, and other short cat leader didn't like Heathcliff because he was tougher than all of them put together. <br />
<br />
The chick cat dug Heathcliff, but he was always too cool to worry much about her.  <br />
<br />
Edit: Run on sentences rock. And BAH! Lisboa beat me to the punch. Edited by: Kaielen at: 10/15/03 11:11 am</div></div><hr />
