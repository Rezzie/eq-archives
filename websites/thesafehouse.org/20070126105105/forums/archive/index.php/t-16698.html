(FYI it was close to 30 for me Orc Rogue) I turned in 25, went out and got 40 more, turned in 5ish and was done, but I got alot of coin in the process. Is this part bugged/no quest giver? Or am I missing him somehow?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harvey</div><div class="date">01-11-05, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, 30 was the magic number for me (I've seen people report anywhere from 23-40, but not sure what causes the randomness in numbers).  At that point your reputation turns green and you can no longer turn in cards.<br />
<br />
They then redirect you to Fahrad, who doesn't say much useful at that point.  He will train you, but so far I've gotten no more quests beyond the sydnicate badge quest.<br />
<br />
Folks on the WoW forums report GMs have confirmed the next set of quests are not working as intended, so they're looking into getting them fixed.  But right now, once you finish the syndicate badge quest you're done for now.<br />
<br />
Basically, it gives you a rogue trainer if you're hunting in Hillsbrad.  Otherwise, we'll have to wait for them to fix the rest of it.</div></div><hr />
