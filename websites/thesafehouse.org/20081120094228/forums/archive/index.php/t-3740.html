It was great fun supporting the EQ community as my Cleric traveled the lands of Norrath and beyond.   Currently, I myself am doing a bit of traveling.  Currently stationed in Guam with virtually no bandwidth to go towards EQ, I won't be able to update this very often.  I look forward to coming back in October.   Admin's, please feel free to twink the listing.<br />

If you chose to reference this material, include (at a minimum) a by line and a link to this page.  Thank you.<br />

<br />
The fun part is trying to tell people what they need to do, based on their relayed information from the seer  .  I've gotten to the point where I just tell them to email me a log.</div></div><hr />

Tallon Fell before you with great ease, you seem to remember some strange pouches around his body, but well it's probably nothing.<br />
<br />
These two show up when I do 'unlock memories'.  I tried saryn preflag again to see if this fixes it but it doesn't.  And I have MM flag and Saryn flag and the rune shows up on my arm and when I hail the librarian it tells me about the invasion.  Anyone know how to fix VZ and TZ flag like this?<br />

I'd suggest starting a new thread including a full log of your seer meditation.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;runes&quot; ... there are many similar things about the arm text, none really say &quot;rune&quot;<br />
<br />
Mithaniel has been bested. An aura surrounds the mystical symbols that have appeared on your arm<br />
Saryrn has been bested. An aura surrounds the mystical symbols that have appeared on your arm.<br />
The Cipher of the Divine Language appears on your arms for a brief moment then fades.&quot;<br />
<br />
Depending on which of these it is, might help.  <br />
<br />
If you post a new thread with your text, people can be much more helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_eqsunil</div><div class="date">08-23-03, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what you get in 'guided meditations' for doing the first half of the Askr quest in PoS. (turn in the combined bag with bone, beard and sash)  If you get this, you need to get the two medallions and finish the quest.<br />
<br />
You have shown your prowess in battle to Askr, now you must make strides to get to the Bastion of Thunder.<br />

According to this thread, instead of these two I need to have Maelin talking about the Zeks/Solusek planning an invasion of Norrath there. I've killed both TZ/VZ and hailed the projections and such, and I'm TOTALLY flagged up to this point...WTF do I do to get my SolRo Access?</div></div><hr />

According to this thread, instead of these two I need to have Maelin talking about the Zeks/Solusek planning an invasion of Norrath there. I've killed both TZ/VZ and hailed the projections and such, and I'm TOTALLY flagged up to this point...WTF do I do to get my SolRo Access? <br />
Please post this in a separate thread with your guided meditation and unlock memories.  First off thoughts would be to 1) Hail the librarian.  2) say I have new lore to the librarian. or 3) I have new information to the librarian Edited by: Sedrek at: 8/25/03 9:46 pm</div></div><hr />

Have you talked to Maelin?  Go hail him first (important!), then say 'what information', 'what lore', if you have not done this yet.  This is what gives you the sol ro flag.</div></div><hr />

Talking to Maelin (&quot;I have new lore,&quot; or &quot;I have new information&quot;) after hailing him turns the Agnarr flag into this.  You have Agnarr.<br />

I think you need to go see Maelin and tell him, &quot;I have new information&quot; again after killing RZ.  Looking through what you posted, I can't see any missing kill flags.<br />

I've got those flags, hailed all the people in the sick house, tried to unlock my memories with the seer multiple times, but still can't seem to finish off the Saryn line.  It shows both Bertox and Terris Thule closed, so I should have everything from all the NPC's involved in those...  Any ideas?  The only thing that it seems might've put me out of whack was that I killed Saryn before I ran the hedge maze.  The order I did it in was basically KoS, Saryn, Hedge, then Terris.  Anything I need to go back on with those?  I wouldn't think so, since it shows the Terris line as closed. Edited by: Gilson UnVar at: 9/16/03 7:03 am</div></div><hr />

Actually it does, although indirectly.  The 3 individual flags you get for each of the trials don't combine to the &quot;all of Honor's Trials&quot; flag until you have the MM kill flag.  Furthermore, until you talk to Maelin, there are 2 flags that show up for killing MM.</div></div><hr />

Basically, start at the pre-flag for Grummus, and go through everything to the pre-flag for Saryrn.  9 times out of 10 (been at least that many guildies that I've helped), it's the post-Bertoxx hailing of Alder AND Elder Fuirstel.<br />

These two show up when I do 'unlock memories'. I tried saryn preflag again to see if this fixes it but it doesn't. And I have MM flag and Saryn flag and the rune shows up on my arm and when I hail the librarian it tells me about the invasion. Anyone know how to fix VZ and TZ flag like this? I've fixed several in my guild who had this same exact text.  They had to go into PoI factory and hail the gnome and say, &quot;test the machine&quot;.  Then they had to zone into Tactics.  Not doing so didn't complete the flag cycle.  Once you do that, you'll need to go to the Seer again and do &quot;guided meditation&quot; to get flags in order, and then &quot;unlock memories.&quot;  This part of the text should then disappear.</div></div><hr />

I hailed him (got a flag) said &quot;what lore&quot; (NO flag) said &quot;what information&quot; (got flag).  on the what lore part, he replied with &quot;what is this you have found, it appears to be written in the divine language.

An Image of Mithaniel flashes before you, &quot;you have yet to earn a place of Honor. When you have, we will speak again.&quot;<br />

What are those last 2? When i do the guided meditation i get a few completed lines about AD, grummus, mauvin's case...i also get a few of the incomplete lines about Thelin and Milyk. And i get a line about Miak needs you to find the correct way to channel the portal.<br />

Anyway, like i said the 2 in bold is that the hoh trials or what?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My Intricate Wooden Figurine has AC 15 ...<br />

Unlock my memories shows no open tasks.<br />
<br />
Can you help me and tell me which flags i still miss ?<br />
(i believe BoT and PoJ all 6 trials)<br />
<br />
i hailed the Seer today and got the answer:<br />
<br />
- Learning of Zebuxoruk´s fate, the only way to save him is gather materials that will allow you to power up the machine to send you into the Plane of Time. Maelin has charged you with finding an elemental power source sufficient to activate Meldrath´s time machine.<br />
- The Cipher of the Divine Langueage appears on your arms for a brief mement then fades.<br />
-You have completed all of Honor´s Trials.<br />
-You have bested Aerin´Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel´s Halls.<br />

I am 100% sure that I have killed and hailed the VZ PP TWICE.  Just got MM last night.  But it won't update my charm or let me zone into Elems or SolRo!<br />
<br />
I tried the following so far:<br />
Hailed Maelin, got flag<br />
Said New Lore, got flag and this:<br />
[Thu Oct 23 18:40:30 2003] You say, 'new lore'<br />
[Thu Oct 23 18:40:30 2003] Maelin tells you, 'Since we now know of the fate of Zebuxoruk I would suggest seeking those that could have had a hand in the planning and tactics of that situation.  The Zeks are especially gifted at things of this nature.  I would recommend trying to get any information from them that you can.'<br />
<br />
Said New information, no flag, got the following:<br />
[Thu Oct 23 18:40:31 2003] You say, 'new information'<br />
[Thu Oct 23 18:40:32 2003] Maelin tells you, 'More notes in the divine language?  You are quite the intrepid adventurer I must say!  I can tell from these letters that they are some communication between Tallon and Vallon.  Why don't you go try to find the responses to these notes so that I can make complete sense of the dialgoue that is taken place.  If I am not mistaken though, the fate of Norrath lies in the hands of Rallos and Solusek!'<br />
<br />
Hailed Malek at PoFire, got flag.<br />
Hailed Gnome in RZ, nothing.<br />
Re-Hailed the people in Sick Bay, didn't help.<br />
Relogged, didn't help.<br />
Zoned multiple times, didn't help.<br />
Tried Hailing Maelin with Time key in bank:<br />
[Thu Oct 23 18:48:42 2003] You say, 'Hail, Grand Librarian Maelin'<br />
[Thu Oct 23 18:48:42 2003] Maelin tells you, 'Welcome back my friends.  I assure you that I have been studying the Cipher of Druzzil very diligently.  Did you happen to find any lore or information that I could look at?'<br />
<br />
<br />
and with Time key wielded, neither helped.<br />
[Thu Oct 23 18:44:30 2003] You say, 'Hail, Grand Librarian Maelin'<br />
[Thu Oct 23 18:44:30 2003] Maelin tells you, 'The Quintessence!  Oh my this is amazing!  I have come into contact with Chronographer Muon in the realm of innovation.  Go to him, show him you have the power to activate machine. I shall meet you there, this I must see!'<br />
<br />
<br />
Friend also reports that he recently 'lost' his Agnarr flag... his char was fully flagged, but now suddenly has no Agnarr flag... not sure if my VZ flag somehow vanished, or not.</div></div><hr />

Yes they are very scattered. I am missing berti and berti preflagg. also agnarr and the virgin trial in hoh.<br />
<br />
My problem is in PoI, i killed the dragon to open the door to the factory, i hailed the gnome before the behmoth raid. I think i had already went through the text before because he said somethin like -<br />
&quot; What are ye waitnin for go kill the machine ye coward!&quot; or somethin to that effect. So we went and killed the behmoth, i hailed the gnome after the kill and no flagg upgrade and no adding my TZ and RZ brothers flag to charm.<br />
<br />
things to note:<br />
<br />
I was already flagged for tactics doing the alt quest in PoStorms.<br />
<br />
After repeated /petitions i got several different &quot;theories&quot; as to what is causeing it. I tried them all to no avail. one even told me &quot;not to worry cause i can still enter tactics.&quot; JERK lol, was missing the point! (lvl 54 guide )<br />
<br />
I /petitioned again and got a helpful guide that said &quot; there are several known bugs with the flag system. I will log it in as a bug. There is nothing i can do as a guide or even a GM to get you flagged. Only the developers can fix this&quot; jeez real helpful.....<br />
<br />
So i am coming to you guys for help!! I am sure that some of u know some things i can try and am willing to try anything!<br />

Your behemoth flag is fine, it just doesn't show up anymore after you kill TZ or VZ.<br />

I'd guess you are missing behemoth and/or the preflag for behemoth. &quot;I will test the machine&quot; to the gnome in the factory if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />

&quot;You remember seeing a small trinket by Grummus' body and wondering what it was for. Perhaps speaking to someone near the Plane of Disease will shed some light on the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Go to the guy outside PoD and say &quot;what ward&quot;, then do the unlock memories dance.  That should resolve Grummus flag, which will resolve Bertox.  Then go to Tylis for KoS preflag, this will resolve Saryn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you get Saryn straight, and the 3rd HoH trial, you'll get the Cypher message on your arm.  That'll take care of the Vallon/Tallon parts.  <br />
<br />
I don't see anything about Behemoth, so you'll need that.  After getting MB, hailing the gnome in tactics, and saying What Lore in library, you should then be Sol Ro Flagged.<br />
<br />
To summarize - 3rd HoH Trial, resolve grum flag, resolve kos, resolve saryn, kill MB, hail tactics gnome, Library - 'what lore'.  And then you're good to go.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Saryrn Preflag from hailing Fahlia Shadyglade and saying'I will go'. MUST have Terris Thule AND Bertox complete.&quot;<br />

So, first fo to Fahlia Shadyglade and say &quot;I will go&quot;.  Should get a flag.<br />
Then unlock, that should get you the KoS flag.<br />
Unlock, that should get Saryn<br />

It seems that &quot;Tylis is being tortured by Saryrn. The only way for him to get away from his misery is to escape from the Plane of Torment.&quot; would indicate some problem with the keeper of sorrows. I know back in the spring I was on a raid in which we killed Saryrn. I am certain I remember killing the Keeper of Sorrows. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions on possible screwed up backflags? I talked to everyone in the sickhouse and seemed to get the &quot;right&quot; responces, but still no new unlocked memories. I talked to the gnome and did the &quot;what lore/information&quot; and &quot;new lore/information&quot; routines, he just tells me to come back when I know something new. I am really really frustrated and any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Another thing that is odd is that whenever I hail these people, I repeatedly get flags. For instance, I could hail elder poxbourne all afternoon and get a flag each and every time I hail him. <br />

<br />
Dem this was the same problem i was having earlier can look at my question earlier on page 4 i think.<br />
<br />
Basicly my problem is that i did the alt entrence into tactics (PoS Daiku quest) before i had killed the behemoth. I have also killed the behemoth since, but i still get the &quot;3 turns to the right blah blah blah....&quot; and the gnome in PoI factory stills says &quot;what are ya waiting for ye coward .... &quot; or somethin like that. From what i gather its a non issue. and will be gone once u kill tz,vz,rz,berti,saryn. and get temple ro flagged.<br />
<br />
Currently i am stuck on berti and have everything else minus the nomad trial (lol easiest one in hoh) including MM,RZ and everything else. So if u think u are frustrated, think o me i cant get saryn preflag till i kill berti, i cant get into temple of ro till berti flagged, cant get LMM flag till nomads, i could go on and on for 2 missing events (3 if ya count berti preflag) cant get charm upgrades either. <br />
<br />
So in short- either u havent hailed the gnome before and after behemoth or ya did alt entrence to tactics Via PoS quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The minis are not necessary for access to PoFire.  However, they are still required for access to Sol Ro's chamber.  So, if you plan on going back for another Sol Ro, you will need the minis or the 85% rule to get in.<br />

<br />
It sounds like you are missing at least 1 or more of the HoHa trials.  You have to complete all 3, even if you've already killed MM.  <br />
<br />
The second part sounds like you haven't completed the PoN maze event.  Yes, this is required for clearing the TT flag.</div></div><hr />

There are many, many flags and hails that are required to complete everything needed before the RZ flag will go into place. You're going to need to ask the Seer to guide your meditations, and then compare what she says to the listing on the first page of this thread. The clues as to what has not been completed will be there. It might be as simple as needing to hail the sick bay NPCs, or as complex as missing one or more required flags.</div></div><hr />
