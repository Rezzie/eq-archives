<br />
After reading that DH didn't work from the beginning, I'd like to know if someone would remember with which version DH was fixed.<br />
<br />
&quot;My first kill was at level 16, when I powered up my stealth so I could have detect hidden (heh jokes on me there since DH wouldnt work for 5 more months)&quot; in pub35.ezboard.com/fthesaf...2957.topic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nandurius</div><div class="date">05-25-02, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Detect Hidden,&quot; the ability you get by training stealth, does not actually do much -- it increases the minimum range at which you see archer/minstrels from 125 to 250. Of course, 250 == next to nothing, so this won't help you much.<br />
<br />
&quot;See Hidden,&quot; the realm ability, is part of the 1.50 patch and allows you to see archer/minstrels at all times.</div></div><hr />
