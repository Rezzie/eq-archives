<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aalex Nightshade</div><div class="date">04-11-03, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a limit on how many spells a wizard can scribe into a spellbook? (ie isn't it limited to some number based on level + an intel bonus?)<br />
<br />
I thought there was, but something in another thread now has me second guessing myself.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Non-travel spellbooks are assumed to have as many pages as needed.<br />
<br />
That may have been a &quot;House Rule&quot; I saw in a dragon magazine though.  Its really up to the GM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a spellbook has 100 pages<br />
each spell take up 2 pages per spell level of the spell, with a 0-level spell taking up 1 page.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
For 1st edition (and probably 2nd) I think that information was in the unearthed arcana Edited by: namelessshaman at: 4/11/03 1:06:59 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Raxee</div><div class="date">04-11-03, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, and if you actually follow that rule and do the math, then a wizard who tries to even keep a spellbook the size of an equal-level sorcerors' repertoire will run out of space by level 6 or 7.<br />
<br />
Most GMs I know of either ignore that part of the spellbook rules entirely, or allow for 'dimensional spellbooks' or gigantic 3000-page spellbooks or bags of holding full of spellbooks or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">04-11-03, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, we typically ignore the &quot;Spellbook Size&quot; thing unless a person really gets into their character and wants to keep track of it.  Typically they have 2 to 5 spellbooks they keep an inventory of then.  A Master Spellbook that has all the spells they can at a bank and various others.  Maybe a secondary master they keep at their tower and a few traveling books for different occasions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mdar kelf</div><div class="date">04-11-03, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is also a magical spell book out there that can hold a single spell on a single page. (it's in the 3rd ed DMG magic items IIRC)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">04-12-03, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally do make the wizard keep track of those spellbooks, becuase its one of the reason to play a sorceror, ie NOT having to keep the thing and NOT having to spend money on magical spellbooks.</div></div><hr />
