<br />
If you check out the Safehouse News (http://www.thesafehouse.org/index.php) page, you can see that all of our news categories have an image associated with them. By Default Anime is placed under the Safehouse News general category. Id like to change that but I need an image that represents  the genre as a whole.<br />
<br />
So open up your copies of photoshop and get busy. The winning selection receives a Safehouse Tshirt.<br />
<br />
Only requirements are that it needs to be legable at no more than 100px in heigth. Width should not exceed 150px. The original can be submitted larger but must look ok at the stated dimensions.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps people may want to use this image? I think it looks very cool, also dark enough, and you could put some words near the sleeve of her yukata.<br />
<br />
Bah. I lost my image hosting service. It's a 231kb .png file. I don't have any conversion software nor do I want to ruin the image quality by compressing it badly. So If someone is willing ot host for me.... let me know.<br />
<br />
Other images that may work, but probably a bit bright would be..</div></div><hr />

That's why I went with the clouds, originally.<br />

I want to make something that represents not anime, but ANIMATION.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
just kidding.. leaning towards the Akira ( I assume thats what its from) without the red kanji, although id like to see it with red lettering sintead of white.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FarSky</div><div class="date">06-10-06, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-10-06, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What, no offers to host? :(<br />
<br />
Imageshack it is, then.<br />
<br />
Add Anime News text to this. (http://www.uploadfile.info/uploads/1a126d8684.png)<br />
<br />
I'm indifferent to the Akira one. I think the image I linked would suit the forums better with it's dark, clear colors, and I think the visual of the image suits what our forums are like very well. Just my 2cents. Maybe someone wants to add that text to it.<br />
<br />
Originally, I wanted something that represents anime as whole - such as Studio Ghibli. However, Studio Ghibli are very hard images to truly capture, they are so detailed that so much is lost in transition. So I leaned towards something more simplistic and clear.<br />
<br />
I also didn't want to portray bias towards one series, lest we get a bad first impression (Akira garners a lot of that) so I leaned toward fanart or lesser-known series (the above is from Pani Poni Dash!) but with Fanart, permission would need to be granted, a time consuming process given they are often hard to reach.<br />
<br />
Eh, whatever works in the end. Still looking for other images to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FarSky</div><div class="date">06-10-06, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I threw the text on the picture provided.  I still stand by the akira shot, though.  One, because of its historical significance; it may be popular to have bandwagon hate for it now, but this whole American anime craze wouldn't be possible had it not broken down the barrier so long ago.  Two, using a prominant face of a character in the image is very restrictive, even if it is a lesser-known series.  It loses all sense of generality.</div></div><hr />

I still blame stalk for never letting aidden see my first image. If I would have known, I could have been making new ones all this time :(</div></div><hr />

It's a conspiracy!<br />
 <br />
Against Who, and Why, I'm not exactly sure of yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A correction. Akira is not what caused the &quot;whole American anime craze.&quot; It was the hard and dedicated work of VHS fansubbers decades before it that allowed this craze to happen. Astro Boy comes to mind for anime predating Akira. Also, if we want to attribute something to the massive craze it is now, Akira is but a tiny ripple when compared to Dragon Ball.<br />
<br />
There are many things going against it even as a &quot;staple title of anime.&quot; It being an &quot;anime for adult&quot; did not even make as much waves as the later released Neon Genesis Evangelion did.<br />
<br />
Which brings us to now, I assume none of us want to use Dragon Ball as an image, nor mecha. I'm just thinking out loud, though. I don't have any real solutions, if we are not going to use something like what Len's ideas were, then something current would do well.<br />
<br />
Even moreso given the nature of the forum, I don't see anyone discussing anything before 2000. Not that I'd object, I hope more people talk about them.</div></div><hr />
