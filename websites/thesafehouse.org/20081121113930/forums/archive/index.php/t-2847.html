Compiled by many Safehouse Rogues  <br />
<br />
1. Goto Lon the Redeemed (536, -.83) in the temple of Solusek Ro. He wants you to quest to find two gems (stamina and rightiousness) which you are to give to Ortalius in Sro. Talk to him, and he sends you with a note (NO DROP) to his friend the poisoner.     <br />
    <br />
2. Go find Conium Darkblade in Dagnor's Cauldron(poison merchant). Give him the note, and he gives you an axe (NO DROP) called &quot;never stops chopping&quot; and a clue about the &quot;top of the world&quot;.     <br />
    <br />
3. *optional* Talk to Falyn in the back room of &quot;top of the world&quot; in Highpass, and he sends you to Bryan.     <br />
    <br />
4. Goto Bryan on the back deck at the Lumbermill Inn in Highpass. Give him the axe and he gives you a bag (NO DROP) to fill with 10 different beverages from around the world. NOTE: You must have an empty MAIN slot to hold a new container or you will receive nothing and lose the axe.  The drinks to fill it are:  <br />
    <br />
Underfoot Triple Bock - Kaladim - Tumpy Irontoe     <br />
Tunare's Finest - Felwithe - Wela Muselender     <br />
Vasty Deep Ale - Sister Island in OOT - Or in Erudin     <br />
Lendel's Grand Lauger - Rivervale - Mac Deeppockets     <br />
Gator Gulp Ale - E. Commons Tunnel - Bubar     <br />
Frozen Toe Rum - Halas - Scon McDaniel     <br />
Oblong Bottle (LORE/NO DROP) - OOT @ location neg 1611, pos 2924     <br />
Blood Spirits (LORE/NO DROP) - &quot;a hemo enologist&quot;, Mistmoore, garden, ~lvl 40 mob and drops more than one every time.     <br />
Clockwork Oil Stout - Clockwork CX, Solusek A near Gabbie Mardoddle - (Pickable)     <br />
Blackburrow Swig -     <br />
    <br />
Need a Blackburrow Cask. Found on Gnoll Brewers/Master Brewers in Blackburrow. A common spawn is at loc 32,32 on level 3. Placeholder is a Gnoll Guardsman. Brewer is rare spawn, and Master Brewer ultra rare.     <br />
    <br />
Combine in the Blackburrow Cask: (no brewing skill needed to combine)     <br />
- 4 BlackBurrow Gnoll Skins(NOT PELTS), rare drop of elite gnolls or commanders     <br />
- 2 gnoll pup scalps  <br />
- 2 casks of Ol' TJ's fierce brew (made using brewing trade skill)  <br />
    <br />
The Blackburrow Cask disappears after you correctly combine the ingredients to make the Swig.  WARNING:  Put the cask in a VERY safe place - many disheartened Rogues have accidentally drank this quest item!<br />
    <br />
Once you have all 10 drinks in the box, hit combine to create the box of spirits.<br />
<br />
5. Return the box of spirits to Bryan, and he gives you the Gem of Stamnia (NO DROP).     <br />
    <br />
6. *optional* Goto the Freeport Sewers and find Toxdil. Ask him about the gems, and then about the Gem Case. He tells you that he has the key, but will only give it to you for the gem inside the case. He says he last sold it to a jewler.     <br />
    <br />
7. *optional* Talk to Noresa Sparkle in West Commons. She asks you to save her from Kiz Gix. She also tells you of a &quot;Gem Case&quot;, which you would need two keys to open, and would have to return both box and keys to the &quot;original boxcrafter&quot; to find what is inside.     <br />
    <br />
8. *optional* Kiz Gix roams around befallen side of WC. Upon killing him you recieve a note writen in Goblin, telling you of a Dark Elf &quot;Outcast&quot; who stole a sparkling purse.     <br />
    <br />
9. Find the Outcast (Lynada the Exiled) in Sol A in the High Shaman room. Killing the outcast gets you the Sparkle Purse (NO DROP).  Lynada is a ~35th level caster with a pet and can be nasty if you have to fight goblins nearby as well.  She is a 4hour 15min spawn with no placeholder.  <br />
    <br />
10. Return the Sparkle Purse to Noresa Sparkle and she gives you one of the keys (NO DROP) needed to open the &quot;Gem Case&quot;.     <br />
    <br />
11. Find the Gem Case (NO DROP). It is hidden behind a lock door in the basement of Hallard's Resales in E freeport (loc -100, -500) that you must pick. (Approx 122+ lockpick skill) It used to be guarded by a dog named Scrapps. Spawn time and rate on case is unknown. <br />
    <br />
12. Go back to Noresa and purchase off her a &quot;Sparkling Saphire&quot; (this is the Gem Toxdil wanted) (Cost Approx 500-550pp, is NO DROP).  I would recommend asking for a charisma buff (the 49th Level Enchanter one is GREAT) to help save some plat.<br />
    <br />
13. Return this Saphire to Toxdil, and he gives you the other key (NO DROP) necessary to open the Gem Case.  Toxdil is in the hidden entrance is at the bend in the north side of the wall outside of the West Freeport gate.  Just look around for him, but he is not always spawned. He has place holders of a sewer rat, orc or a guard.<br />
    <br />
14. Give the Gem Case and both keys to Bubar in the East Commons Tunnel to recieve the Gem of Righteousness (NO DROP).  The Gem of Righteousness looks just like the sparkling gem bought from Noressa, but if identified is indeed the real gem. <br />
    <br />
15. Return both Gems to Ortalius, and reap the rewards.     <br />
    <br />
