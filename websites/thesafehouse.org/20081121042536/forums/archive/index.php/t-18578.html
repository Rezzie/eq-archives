<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-03-05, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The big reason to choose Qalia as opposed to Thestra, though, has to do with the existence of the Psionicist. While the Psionicist isn't exclusive to Qalia, it will not be available to players starting in Thestra. According to Sigil, the primary jobs of a psionicist is damage-dealing through the use of psionic powers as well as augment his allies' survivability by increasing their awareness during combat and covering them with diamond-like skin (in other words, nuking and DPS with minor buffing). The most interesting element of the psionicist, though, is how he or she advances. As the psionicist evolves, speaking with a trainer to gain new skills is not always the pathway to more power. Objects called &quot;gestalts&quot; serve as guideposts to unlocking new aspects of their powers. The very evolution of the class, then, is dependent upon which areas of the world they choose to visit. It's not difficult to imagine, then, psionicist versions of &quot;vision quests&quot;, enlightened journeys, or, conversely, taboo areas where they are unable to go. Sigil has built the idea of travel into the very structure of the class.<br />

Psionicists. How cool is that?</div></div><hr />
