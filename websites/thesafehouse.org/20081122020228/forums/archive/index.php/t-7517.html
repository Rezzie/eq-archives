<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grinkle</div><div class="date">04-30-01, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This weekend I tried both TZ and VZ.  Very different experiences, but not sure which were server based vs zone based.<br />
<br />
TZ - half elf bard in GF - got to L4.  PK'd twice, lots and lots of pk'ers running around, lots of juvenile /shouts, general feeling of chaos.  I recall one pk'er, Cynik the gnome, leaving the zone this fondly /shouted rememberance (without the asterisks, full color version) - <br />
<br />
F*** ALL YOU F***ing B******!<br />
<br />
Whew.  Nice roleplaying ....<br />
<br />
VZ - Barbarian Shaman, got to L3, no difference whatsoever from a blue server.  Found it relatively harder to newbie in Everfrost - all the mobs tended to swarm.  Still, no pk'ing, no adolecent denigration of other teams - no Shanks evident, a couple elves in zone, I think.  One L20 Shaman told me that pk'ing is pretty rare.<br />
<br />
Is it zone or server, or both, that made the difference?  4 hours on a server can hardly give on a very comprehensive feel for it, so maybe it was just the particular times I was on, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_MajestykVZ</div><div class="date">04-30-01, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference was the zone.  Everfrost is secluded.  It is isolated from most other races.  Newbie levels (1-5) don't usually travel thru Blackburrow or thru Highpass or Lake Rathe, which is the only way, for a non-human, to travel by ground to the Karanas and Qeynos Hills.  GFay and Freeport are an active PvP zones due to the proximity of opposing races.<br />
<br />
Forgot that haflings can bypass Highpass and go thru the Gorge.  Still tough to do at the Newbie level. Majestyk, Rogue, Shanks, Vallon Zek!We as Shanks, have chosen the hard path. In the hardness of it, is where we find the glory.Edited by: MajestykVZ at: 4/30/01 11:59:53 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">05-01-01, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it was mainly the zone, and had also to do with your weekend play time choice, more of the &quot;anti-PK&quot; folks come out then in my opinion. As ye gain in levels ye will have a more balanced view of each of the servers.<br />
<br />
As per the Shanks not being on, we do not have our tags up at all times...for example we who have our Masks of Deceptions like to complete the disguise by trying to be as anonymous as possible, particularly when in evil/orange team controlled lands.
