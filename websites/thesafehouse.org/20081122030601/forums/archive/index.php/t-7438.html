Comments? Thoughts? Should I drop some powers, or do I need to have others?<br />
<br />
I am thinking about getting Aid Other/Self earlier, but not sure what other powers I should delay for that.. have to think about the order again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd consider putting more slots on Stamina. Dark Armor is a hell of a powerset, but it chews through end like crazy (as I'm sure you've noticed). Just Stamina alone won't be that big a boost in endurance regen.<br />
<br />
Why Aid Other and Self? They're not really useful in combat due to the interruptability, and I'd imagine by 35 downtime healing won't be much of a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, forgot that I can add multiple on that one to increase the regen...<br />
<br />
good points, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Verify that hurdle will stack with the other jumps.  <br />
<br />
Doesnt make sense to take the heals so late.  Your play style is going be so different.<br />
<br />
Every scrapper I have seen dies...constantly.  I would look into the &quot;Save your own ass&quot; type skills.<br />
<br />
Health, SuperJump, Stamina need 2 slots to be more effective at a minimum.<br />
Also you can add more slots to health/stamina and pass on the aid stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hurdle is definately stacking with various jumping for me. With that, combat jumping and sprint slotted for jump I can do well over a two story leap without even having Super leap yet. I can literally kiss the ceiling in any dungeon I've been in. I noticed much larger difference with Hurdle than I expected.<br />
<br />
The heals probably won't be that exciting considering the lifedraining built into the shadow powers. But I can't speak from experience on that one. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would not take Hurdle if you are planning on Super Leap.  Even if they stack you will rarely find yourself needing it, Swift would be much more useful.<br />
<br />
I'd also be wary of EndRdx on toggle powers with an upkeep cost of 0.3 or less.  I don't know if anyone has done the tests yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if most setups round off to zero benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really all comes down to playstyle,and what RP elements your looking for in your hero. DM/DA looks really good,especially the animations and clouds and what not. <br />
<br />
The big problem with the Dark melee/dark armor scrapper is those 2 power sets are the biggest drain on endurance of any of the scrapper pools.<br />
<br />
If you learn to play it right,and it suits your style your fine. For me, i like the idea of alot of fast swings,which is why i went with katana.<br />
<br />
Any scrapper without the regen secondary pool,is going to have to invest in the stamina line,or find some way to reduce endurance drain. My 17 scrapper with 3 toggle defense powers,and 2 attacks blows through stamina like theres no tommorw.<br />
<br />
For that reason i avoided getting super leap,and am sticking with hurdle/combat jump as my travel combo,so i can get stamina at 20. If you sidekick with someone you should be able to see the improvment of any power you have. from gaining 2-3 levels i can see that hurdle/combat jump should be prety decent by level 25 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get some surprisingly serious travel speed out of Combat Jump/Hurdle/Sprint combo, so I can't see the value to getting Swift, personally. I run fast enough. Faster land speed wont' help me navigate terrain like that combo will.<br />
<br />
But leaping fits my character concept best anyway. If I were going for a super speedster I'd probably like Swift alot more. I probably could skip Super Leap if I wanted. Like Aiden said, what I have so far is surprisingly good. But I can't resist the lure of even bigger leaps. :)<br />
<br />
End drain is a big worry, but from what I've seen at least, Broadsword (my primary) has a much heavier drain than dark. It's probably combining it with the Dark armor that's really pushing it over. My dark melee test character never seems to run low on end, but he's got regen secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">End is okay so far, could be better but it's not that bad.<br />
<br />
Hurdle definitly stacks with combat jump and I love it. As Sab already said, I can't see how swift could improve my travel speed noticably.<br />
<br />
I love my combo combat jump / hurdle / super jump.<br />
<br />
I will probably adjust the healing powers and the stamina stuff... maybe I'll get swift instead of the heals.. will see.<br />
<br />
It's not a finalized or well-thought template.. I just tested the char builder and was looking for feedback :) Thanks for the help so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno...whats with the medicine powers?  They just don't seem to jive with the rest of the character.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its alot like the character I originally played, only I went with the katana instead of the Dark Melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would say hes geting it at the end just because he doesnt have any other powers that are intersting.<br />
<br />
I rolled up a baby spines/regen scrapper to mess around with,and looking at that template there are not alot of powers that really fit well with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spines are a nice scrapper set for the ranged attack. Just can't deal with the look though. Not because it's ugly. Just because all spiners look the same with their power activated. Moreso than the other weapon types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got the dark melee/dark armor set on the first Scrapper I made - I tend to need to make sure I carry around as many endurance inspirations as I can - tend to run out of oomph when I really need it - granted, only at level 8<br />
<br />
Katana/regen scrapper set I've got NEVER needs endurance it seems, I went for the 'ever on' healing and endurance regens, as well as offensive attacks only - I can kick ass in a battle, but turns out that I'm REALLY vulnerable to any attacks other than physical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuurus</div><div class="date">06-13-04, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went with the reflexes as a secondary on my dark melee scrapper, and yeah, it's an endurance drain.  (But I don't seem to be &quot;dying constantly&quot; as a scrapper even though I fight half a dozen white/yellows at a time.  Maybe I will when I get over lvl 20  *shrug*  who knows.<br />
<br />
Anyways, to battle the endurance problem, I planned on getting Dark Consumption and Stamina both by lvl 20.  Here's my plan for powers (haven't gone so far as to plan out every enhancement yet):<br />
<br />
Slot 1 (lvl 1) - Shadow Punch<br />
Slot 2 (lvl 1) - Focused Fighting<br />
Slot 3 (lvl 2) - Smite<br />
Slot 4 (lvl 4) - Agile<br />
Slot 5 (lvl 6) - Combat Jumping<br />
Slot 6 (lvl 8) - Shadow Maul<br />
Slot 7 (lvl 10) - Hurdle*<br />
Slot 8 (lvl12) - Siphon Life<br />
Slot 9 (lvl 14) - Super Jump<br />
Slot 10 (lvl 16) - Health<br />
Slot 11 (lvl 18) - Dark Consumption<br />
Slot 12 (lvl 20) - Stamina<br />
Slot 13 (lvl 22) - Quickness<br />
Slot 14 (lvl 24) - Acrobatics<br />
Slot 15 (lvl 26) - Soul Drain<br />
Slot 16 (lvl 28) - Lucky<br />
Slot 17 (lvl 30) - Dodge<br />
Slot 18 (lvl 32) - Midnight Grasp<br />
Slot 19 (lvl 35) - Touch of Fear<br />
Slot 20 (lvl38) - Elude<br />
<br />
* - I've already progressed and taken the powers up to this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is my first character, no beta experience, and done no real research...just going by the game manual, kinda planned this out roughly.  Of course, I had no idea if hurdle would be of any use taking Super Jump later, but others here seem to say it is still a boost and I have to take either that or swift to get my health and stamina, and swift seems of even less use to my character  =)<br />
<br />
Likewise, I considered getting Focused Senses for my defense against ranged attacks, but figured I'd be ok with Lucky later on, and Lucky is an auto rather than toggled.  That's part of the problem with my endurance right now I think, running two toggled defensive powers all the time (Focused Fighting and Combat Jumping), but my survivability seems pretty good with those and Agile (an auto power).  Plus I'll be adding more toggled defense - Acrobatics and Elude, and more auto defense - Lucky and Dodge.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or reccomendations from anyone who has played with this combo, or even just has experience on the effectiveness later on of the Reflexes as a secondary power set?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">06-13-04, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd lose the aids and try to slip hasten in right after stamina, it's not the killer power it used to be, but fully slotted with recharge reducs it's still a very nice power. Unfourtunately it looks like you wouldn't want anything else from that pool... jump kick?  maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-13-04, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I know is, I've focused specifically on reducing the cost of running Dark Embrace/AoE Damage Aura. What I've determined is, as far as toggle abilities are concerned, the slots are better spent on accuracy and damage/resist damage ect.... than on endurance reduction. Reason being: With 0 attached slots for endurace reduction, running Combat Jumping + Dark Embrace + AoE Aura barely effects your total endurace. It's the attack abilities that are the real endurance sink. <br />
<br />
In fact, it's so bad that in order to be worth much to groups, I end up having to spam all my attack powers constantly. Result being, I'm out of end within the first 45 seconds of a fight, without even turning on toggle abilities. Meanwhile, blasters, controllers, defenders, and even tankers have practically full end after each fight. Just as a test, I played my Psychic Defender after a long night of grouping, using nothing by psychic attack powers. After unloading with Mental Blast, Subdue, and Psychic Lance against 3 opponenents, non-stop, I finished the fight with 1/2 end left. Compared to fighting 3 opponents with my scrapper of equivalent level, I had 0 end after spamming my powers.<br />
<br />
If a scrapper can get the cost of their attack powers down, everything else is copacetic. I'd rather have the end to attack with a power 2 more times than hit for 1-2 points more damage, or disorient for 1-2 more seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">06-13-04, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just as a test, I played my Psychic Defender after a long night of grouping, using nothing by psychic attack powers.

<br />
Thats because the recharge and animation on the Psy Blast powerset are slow, dirt slow. Probably the slowest overall set of any attacks in the game.<br />
<br />
Especially the animation speed.<br />
<br />
If I fire off either of my attacks other than subdue(Only fast one I have, and its still slow...), Odds are 50/50 that some scrapper or blaster will have killed it before my shot hits.  I'm in a 2 person group, where I'm actually having to carry some offensive weight. So most fights, I don't bother firing, unless its an attacvk at the very beginning of the fight, or at the end when healing is not needed. If someone else is already attacking a non-boss, I don't bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dime</div><div class="date">06-13-04, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I take swift power all the time because in door missions sometimes you need to run and ge out fast.  You can't hurdle your way out fast enought.  Also slows will come into play later and you'll want the extra run speed.  Also some toggle powers slow you down a bit but swift will make up for it.<br />
<br />
Right now Im messing around with a broadsowrd/super reflexes scrapper and he is owning all over right now.  Was a horrible build until I was able to get stamina and slot it a bit.  With Hasten plus quickness I get a 73.5% haste bonus.  It's incredible how fast I can attack now.  The slow animation of swinging the sword is still there but it's no bother anymore.<br />
<br />
Took hasten at level 6 with this build to fight boss' in solo missions.  only time i used it until i was able to get SO's in hasten and now its always on.</div></div><hr />
