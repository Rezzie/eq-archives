<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-14-07, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the 21st century, Britianna has taken over Japan and renamed it Area 11. The Japanese people have lost their name, freedom, and even language. In order to fight against this injustice, two young boys seek a path of defeating Britianna.<br />
<br />
Suzuka is the son of the Japanese Prime Minister. He is an idealistic man, wishing to change the world from within the Britianna army. Because he is an eleven (japanese), he is not trusted and ignored. However, when he is given the powerful mecha, Lancelot, he has gained ability to fight.<br />
<br />
Lelouche is the son of the Emperor of Britianna, one of his nearly countless bastard sons. After an incident as a child where his mother was killed, he decieded to destroy Britianna to change the world to be a better place for his sister, Nunally. After being in the wrong place at the wrong time, he obtains the power of Geass - the ability to make an order that one cannot disobey.<br />
<br />
Lelouche on his path of carnage, Suzuka on his path of idealism. Two opposites pitted against each other with the same goal - to make the world a better place.<br />
<br />
The show is a very engaging show of two boys having their beliefs challenged, and is sure to cause some VERY strong emotions within people. Some will like Suzuka's idealism, others like Lelouche. It is an incredible show that I highly recommend.</div></div><hr />

Incredible. I love the last two episodes. It's really challenged both Suzuka and Lelouche. Suzuka with the order to kill 'em all, even after they surrendered. And Lelouche with confronting the realities of war.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering how this will play out. In my humble opinion, Suzuka is really making a fool out of himself. He's no better than Lelouche. This is why I think Lloyd is the best character in the series, because of how he basically just tells Suzuka to take his dreams and shove it up his ass.<br />
<br />
I really feel sorry for Shirley. Confronted with things like this is hard. Do you go on, or do you stop? Countless of people have died who have families and lovers, Shirley really demostrated this well. Which really pisses me off about Suzuka's pretentions preaching - talking about how it's all the Order of the Black Knight's fault and Zero's fault. HE KILLED PEOPLE TOO!<br />
<br />
Really, one of the best shows I've seen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-15-07, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with it being more than mecha. For someone like me, mecha is something I have an averse reaction to. So it takes something extraordinary to get me to watch it. If anything, it's more of a strategic thriller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">01-23-07, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had been intending to watch the show since the early designs were teased.  A CLAMP mecha show was just something that begged to be watched.  Then I forgot about it, but I'm catching up now.  <br />
<br />
While I'll agree that it's not just simply a mecha show, I don't see it as being that much different from many of the mecha shows which are denegrated as being simply 'big dumb mecha shows'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-23-07, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm certainly not comparing it to Full Metal Panic and Gundam. If I were to compare it to the &quot;big dumb mecha shows&quot; I'd pick something like, oh, Gravion. These kind of shows are more mecha-centric - everything's just an excuse to have mecha.<br />
<br />
It has to have an excellent story to get me to watch it, that's all. Comparatively, what does Code Geass have over Gravion? It's like the people who can't watch &quot;those dumb harem anime&quot; and yet love stuff like Kimagure Orange Road, Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, etc. &quot;Those dumb harem anime&quot; referring to cannon fodder stuff that's only put out for the genre maniacs to eat up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I basically expected Euphie to die this episode, and that was predictable. Despite that, however, it was an excellent conclusion albeit sad. Perhaps Suzaku won't be such a whiny little girl now.<br />
<br />
I don't think Toprem even has a emoticon to represent this episode's sheer awesomeness! <br />
<br />
Too bad we have to wait until the summer for episodes 24/25. That sucks royally. If you're not watching this show, you fail at life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">04-26-07, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just finished.  Or should I say, got caught up.<br />
<br />
I'd been avoiding this thread and other posts related to Geass as much as I could in the meantime.<br />
<br />
I didn't realize the last two episodes weren't coming till this summer.  <br />
<br />
Dear GOD am I hating life (ok, just Sunrise) right now.  :(</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I like.<br />
 <br />
'Lulu' reminds me a whole lot of Yagami Light, back when he was awesome. (pre-near)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">11-27-07, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@13. Agree with above statements.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Lulu just realizes more what he's doing, tho I fear he really is taking too far taking out the JLA as bait.<br />
 <br />
Suzuka is a whiner. that part at the funeral was absurd! He's killed people, and just cause he's never been the one to kill a friend's parent, he feels like he can preach... what an asshat.<br />
 <br />
The chick getting it on at night to the pic of Euphie was a pretty 'omg' moment. I hope she turns into some kind of stalker and goes insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">11-28-07, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so, just finished 24-25<br />
 <br />
 <br />
...AND THEN?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?<br />
 <br />
I knew the ending was going to be total crap from everything else ever animated by Clamp, but i figured since everyone thought it was sooo good, that i'd give it a shot. 'second series in production' gee never heard THAT ONE before......<br />
<br />
This is going to be Tsubasa Chronicle all over again. :roll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">11-28-07, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they need to make more of these shows with mature heroes :(</div></div><hr />

It has been slated for two seasons since the beginning. Nobody considers 25 to be the ending in any way whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">11-29-07, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh, i know it isn't the end. I'm worried for the REAL end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">11-29-07, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as there is blood, more big characters dying, war, drama, i'm a happy camper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">11-29-07, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just worried. Clamp has a horrible track record with me, and the way things were moving at the end of the first series could easily put it into Eva/DN territory.<br />
 <br />
*removed seven paragraphs of text here, i was rambling and ranting*<br />
 <br />
I just hope it somehow saves itself from the path the story seemed to be taking. (to me, anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">11-29-07, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clamp has no involvement in Code Geass other than the character designs.<br />
<br />
I won't say I have high hopes for Code Geass, but I'm happy just with how things have unfolded for the first 25 episodes. It would have to take a gigantic screw up to make me forget that. They may screw up, but I don't think badly enough that I would not like the show.</div></div><hr />
