<br />
We are a multi-gaming guild established one year ago, and are currently active in Battlefield 2, CounterStrike: Source, Euro-WoW, and now Vanguard: Saga of Heroes. Our guild was founded by a group of experienced online gamers, who have been gaming together since before Eternal Vigilance's inception.<br />
<br />
We are a democratic guild, with a unique way of splitting up each gaming division into &quot;Cohorts&quot;, run by officers who are elected by the guild every four months. Our new V:SOH cohort has been established, and we are ready to begin recruitment. The leaders of our cohort are both avid followers of Vanguard, and have been for some time, so if there is anything you wish to ask me, Centurion Elaemar (Leader of our division), or Optio Stasus (Second in Command of our division) about Eternal Vigilance, the running of our cohort, or the game itself, please feel free to ask.<br />
<br />
Our memberbase is spread across the globe, from Canada, to the US, to Europe, and will most likely be playing on an East-Coast server (if it ever matters), to satisfy both the European and North American members.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harelin</div><div class="date">01-29-06, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all - <br />
 <br />
I'm a proud member of EV, and have been with the guild since its inception.  I was a part of the founding crew over a year ago when myself and eleven others decided to leave our current guild and create something more true to our desires.  I am honored to have worked beside who I like to call my fellow 'gaming pioneers' - paving the road for guild mechanics and leadership styles unprecedented in any guild I have personally witnessed during my '98-06 MMO gaming career.<br />
 <br />
Let me take the time to briefly explain how things work over here at Eternal Vigilance.  This is not your traditional brick-and-mortar guild, and I want to help you to understand that you would be joining a guild that is in the business of, shall we say, 'breaking conventions.'<br />
 <br />
To begin with...<br />
1) We are a democracy - but we actually have it DOWN.  No efficiency lost in the process.  We reap the benefits of having a well-liked and democratically elected leadership, while still being organized on a level competitive with your typical 'dictatorship' style-guild (you know the ones, rife with power struggles and drama at every turn).  Democratic guilds have been attempted in the past, but rarely succeeded because they were too wishy-washy and lacked direction.  Eternal Vigilance has solved the problems inherent in both worlds, creating a leadership style deserving of its own category.<br />
2) We are a multi-gaming guild - when you join, you're making a decision that will benefit you for years to come.  You're joining a community that has been specifically built to adapt and progress across the gaming spectrum, both FPS and MMO, fluidly.  And due to this multi-gaming platform, we are at an advantage over start-up guilds in each new game... having already been through the creation process, executing a tried and true approach with members that already have experience working with each other (in the case of our Vanguard division, years of experience).  Multi-gaming guilds are nothing new, but our approach to it is.<br />
3) We are international - we have a very unique near-even split between North Americans and Europeans.  How does this benefit you?  Imagine a guild with members on at all times of the day, and no matter your current time zone or work schedule... being in a position to always hop on and find company.<br />
4) We are supportive of your growth - be a member, or be a leader.  You have the choice.  Within months, you can find yourself at the helm of a division in another game or even our Vanguard division itself... if you're made of the right stuff.  We have a linear 3-rank progression system, where at the lowest (entry level) tier you have certain rights within the guild, but those rights GROW as you put effort towards your progression... eventually putting you at the top, and in a position to vote on leadership decisions, lead divisions, etc.<br />
 <br />
I'll stop there, but there is so much more and I hope by this point I have piqued your interest.  Please feel free to stop by our website (http://www.evcitadel.com), view the 'Join Us/About (http://evcitadel.com/ev/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=6)' pages, study our Guild Charter (http://evcitadel.com/ev/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=28), or peruse our forums (http://www.evcitadel.com/ev/index.php?option=com_smf&amp;Itemid=26).  You will find a bustling community eager to make you its next addition to the family.</div></div><hr />
