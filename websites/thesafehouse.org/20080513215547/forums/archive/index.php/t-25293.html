<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsalikr</div><div class="date">07-20-06, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Long time member as an EQ1 rogue.  I've been playing WoW for a year or so. I became addicted to PvP with my hunter.  Although I like that class I've always missed being a rogue, so I've been playing my little rogue more and my big hunter less.<br />
<br />
Recently I've been playing Tsalikr in the lvl29 battlegrounds and doing quite well.  However, I just leveled (like an idiot) and now I need some help deciding where to go with my additional talents.<br />
<br />
1)  What does the most damage in PvP, maces, swords or daggers?  I've read that people will give up the backstab/ambush skills to duel-wield swords or maces.  Is it worth it to give up those skills in the 30-39 arena? How about later in the game?<br />
<br />
2) What essential skills do you need?  Currently I have some things that, while they help me with pve and with my dag/backstab build, I wouldn't think they would be necessary for certain builds.   I have improved gouge 3, camouflage 5, improved backstab 3 and opportunity 2.  Obviously if I get away from the dagger/backstab build, these won't be used.  What should I use in it's place if I do change?<br />
<br />
3) What type of items will help in pvp?  I am a blacksmith, but I have other charaters who are alchemists, tailors and leatherworkers.  I also have an enchanter and engineer, but it's hard to use engineering between characters.  I've already made a spider belt and green-whelp armor.  Are these useful?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">07-20-06, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tradeskills: Engineering and Alchemy are prolly your best bets for PVP.  Alchemy gives you a ton of potions and engineering will allow you to use items that give you another chance to use a rogue ability (stealth, etc) or something crazy like the net or death ray.<br />
<br />
Build: Both daggers or duel wield sword/mace work fine.  Depends what you want though, an Ambush/BS build is straight up nasty one shot kill, but then kind of susceptible.  Sword/mace doesn't have the burst dps, but has better overall sustained DPS.<br />
<br />
Talent Specs: I've always liked the sublety one that gave me a faster stealth speed, that's a really nice thing to have in pvp.  Cold Blood is also a nice lifesaver as well, plus with flag in WSG you can sprint, get the boots, cold blood, and sprint again.  Nice getaway.<br />
<br />
Priest is my main right now, so i'm sure others have much better stuff to say</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1)  What does the most damage in PvP, maces, swords or daggers?Very broadly speaking, Swords/Maces are often used for &quot;stunlock&quot; builds, whereas Daggers are often used for &quot;burst&quot; builds.  However, keep in mind that Daggers do not really come into their own until you have Lethality 5, Improved Backstab 3, and Opportunity 5 - until you have enough talent points to afford those all, it's fairly common for people to just use Sword/Mace because it's easier.  ;p  Honestly, though, it's personal preference and playstyle.  Do you prefer the &quot;jump out, stab 'em hard, and make your getaway&quot; approach (which means you're screwed if they get the jump on you), or the &quot;charge in with weapons a'swingin' and don't leave until they're good and dead&quot; approach (which means you're screwed if you mistime your stuns, or they break 'em)?<br />
<br />
2) What essential skills do you need?Improved Gouge 3 is probably the most underrated PVP skill ever.  In PVP, after 5 seconds of not fighting, you can restealth - and Imp Gouge 3 gives you a 5.5 second Gouge.  This means you can Gouge, de-select 'em, back off a step, and restealth just before the Gouge breaks...without having to burn Vanish.  MoD5 and Camo5 are both nice tools (personally, I can't live without Camo5 + Minor Run Speed enchant).<br />
<br />
3) What type of items will help in pvp?Broadly speaking, Engineering is &quot;the PVP tradeskill&quot;.  Mind control, death ray, extra nukes, extra AEs, snares, etc.  Every other tradeskill either A) doesn't have many PVP &quot;toys&quot;, or B) lets you just purchase whatever items you need from someone else.</div></div><hr />

While this is true, I'm willing to take it a step further and say that daggers don't really come into their own unless you have Cold Blood at the least and I would say either Preperation or Seal Fate as well.  There's just not really a good reason to be daggers without those talents for PvP.</div></div><hr />

Unless of course your just talking about twink lvl daggers.<br />
Cause 600+ ambush crits in the 29 bracket is just insane. <br />
<br />
Anyway once I'm done messing around with my rogue int he 29 bracket I'll lvl him to 60, but I'm going to stay daggers. A dagger/subt build is what i've always had in mind as a rogue for all games; and wow is one of the few games, taht lets me do it, and about the only MMOG that lets me do it.</div></div><hr />
