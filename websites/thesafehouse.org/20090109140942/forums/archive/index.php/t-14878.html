Many of my happiest moments in EQ1 involved slinking around dangerous places: trekking for the Hate book, banking/shopping in KOS cities, looting a Mask of Deception, etc.  I'd love to know that EQ2 offers similar thrills.<br />
<br />
What's the difference between &quot;hidden&quot; and &quot;invisible&quot;?  Do scouts have an edge over mages?<br />
<br />
Do mobs use diffent senses for detection?  Does it really matter much?<br />
<br />
What are the benefits of sneaking around?  Does it help in groups?  Solo?  For tradeskills?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">orcmauler</div><div class="date">10-21-04, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I can tell you this so far, but I am lowish level (15) still.<br />
Stealth for my predator works on a level based/skill base.  <br />
<br />
Higher level monsters will be more likely to spot me in stealth, modified by my skill level.  For example of this-At level 12 I had sneak app 1 (lowest level) and aggressive creatures white or higher saw thru it with unfailing accuracy.  However I upgraded to Adept 1 (a pretty high jump) and most whites were fooled.<br />
<br />
Sorry I don't have hard numbers there, just relating experiences.<br />
<br />
As far as it versus invis, I am not sure, but I can let you know that as of last week mages see invis does NOT see stealth.<br />
<br />
Also when you stealth in game you are invisible to anyone but people in your group.  This leads to a lot of complaints about kill stealing as an invis rogue is stalking a mob but gets it yanked by a range/melee what have you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly the same Thwick. I don't know the true mechanics behind it, but it has the same look and feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">10-21-04, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good to hear Nocte. It gives it more of a realistic feel than EQ 1's hide/sneak god mode and forces the player to actually have to worry about being stealthy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JookaWoo</div><div class="date">10-21-04, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in my experience with it it lets you know right away if a mob will see you. Maybe its just some of the time but when Ive gone into sneak you can see if an agro mob is still going to agro.<br />
<br />
the con system works like this, the mobs name is its con(in red, orange, white, green, blue, grey text) if its highlighted in red its agro. So when you go into sneak you can tell if an agro mob is still agro if the red highlight stays. Agro mobs who's highlight disapears once you stealth they will be non agro. At least thats been my experience so far, no serious testing tho. So its not like WoW really in my mind if Im correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">10-21-04, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah. Thanks JookaWoo. I hadn't figured out that &quot;aggro&quot; hint yet. It was a pain figuring out what will attack on sight and what didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JookaWoo</div><div class="date">10-21-04, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could be totally off in regards to the stealth part since I dont really have an account but played some via a friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bayler</div><div class="date">10-21-04, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback, guys.<br />
<br />
Interesting.  It sounds as if level and skill matter (yay!), but that whether a given mob can see you is still an on/off thing (boo!).  So then, if the con tells you that a mob can't see you, you can stroll up, stand right in front of him, strip naked, and blow cigar smoke in his face, as long as you don't break stealth -- just like EQ1?  A simple and workable system, I guess.  <br />
<br />
I was kinda expecting something more sophisticated: where how much noise you make and how well you stick to dark areas matters.  And maybe a Thief-like alertness-feedback system, where a mob will say, &quot;Did you hear something?&quot; if you fail only slightly.  But then, maybe that's too complicated for a MMORPG.  Or maybe others have tried it, and it just doesn't work well in this kind of game.<br />
<br />
Still, it sounds as if the mechanics are strong enough to give us some good prowling.</div></div><hr />

What you talk about here is sorta how WoW works it, if a mob thinks he sees you, then he stops and looks in your direction.  If you move backwards you should be okay, and he'll leave you alone.   Was hoping to see something of the same thing in EQ2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ethion</div><div class="date">10-24-04, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In eq2 steath is based on level.  Mobs that are more that 2 levels higher than you can see you just as if you were not stealthed at all.  Group stealth is also based on the rogue level.<br />
<br />
You can tell a mob sees you because it's name is outlined in red indicating that it is agro.  When you are hiden and the mob can't see you the name has no outline.  <br />
<br />
Some mobs like sentry mobs will see through your hide even if not higher lvl then you.  So you need to be careful.  Conning is easy though as the name is displayed by just mousing over the target.<br />
<br />
Finally when a mob sees you it doesn't immediately attack.  It will react to you first.  Like another poster said if you are watching a mob as you approach and it turns and faces you you have a second or so to back away.<br />
<br />
I really like how the mobs react to you.  In addition to this looking at you they will cower away from you when you are much higher lvl then they are.  Makes you feel rather intimidating to have highway bandits cower as you run by, esp when you recall the first time the ambushed you in a mountain pass.</div></div><hr />
