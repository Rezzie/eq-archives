the campaign takes place in Age of Might, and the characters gathered at Piqual (sp?). We were witness to the fall of Piqual and had a pretty good siege by a barbarian horde led by some as yet unknown force.<br />
<br />
It started off with my character, a human ranger, and an elven warrior metting in a tavern. We talked at the tavern, visited the weaponsmith in town for my character to buy a crossbow, and the ranger to buy arrows since we were to leave the town the next morning. On our way back to the tavern (where I had previously been given a bottle of dwarven spirits),horns blew on the city walls, the elven companion ran off toward the armorment. We followed. We were on the walls and saw after a bit of confusion and a dispell by the towns wizards, a barbarian horde of nearly 2000 coming to storm the city of Piqual, occupied by a elven army/militia numbering 600. <br />
<br />
The barbarians started using ladders to climb the walls, and a fight ensued, I managed to, using my strength check, push a ladder off a battlement which 4 elves couldn't accomplish (heh heh). Barbarians were quickly on the wall. In this one section, there was about 6 barbarians and 10 elves, the ranger, and me. I attacked one that landed near me, and my attack was good, but not good enough, this army had some major power behind them because these barbarians were wearing plate armor underneath their fur clothing. Well, luckily the barbarian fumbled his attack, and missed me. The next move I recieved, I got a elven companion who we met on the wall to toss me a torch, using the dwarven spirits, I blew a fireball at the barbarian, I did a decent roll, but not good enough apparently, but it managed to catach this barbarians beard and hair on fire. The elves near me attacked this barbarian, but they missed since he is now flailing around, and so I take the bottle and throw it at him. I roll a 20 (hehe) and so the dm being gracious, allows the barbarian to go up in flames (score 75 exp for inventive fighting after the game was over). Then, the horde retreats and rolls up these massive catapults. They begin firing at the town and destroying the walls, one of the players who was given an npc to play (the same elf who tossed me the torch) until his character can be introduced during the second session decided to load a balista with himself riding a massive bolt, tied to as much liquor as could be put on the bolt and himself (he wound up fully taking out one of the catapults in his blaze of glory.) <br />
The next thing was the death of the elven lord of Piqual, he was shot on the tower, and my character using his knowledge of poisons (while maintaining his secret identity as a rogue) discovered that the lord had been shot with a very heaily enchanted poison. The Lod, before he died, dispatched 6 scribes to make a message to be beared to Silvanesti. We were given the scrolls, and had to run from the city of piqual which was getting decimated, and try to make it out. We all made it, and I even was able to steal a elven sword before we left the &quot;palace&quot;, and pickpocket a barbarian as I was running away. (a few details omitted that made this action easier). I didn't get much from the barbarian except for a few copper and a strange weed.  <br />
<br />
Thax (my dwarf) was able to keep up because before we left the castle, we were outfitted with some boots that gave us +10 to jump and increased our run speed by x2. They are supposed to be turned in once we reach Silvanost...but Thax's will probably be stolen mysteriously the night before we reach the city. *whistles*. <br />
<br />
I'm going to keep the weed and see if I can use it later on in a drink or something to heighten a gather info check or move silently or some such.<br />
<br />
Also, for some unknown reason, the DM and co-DM allowed me to have a &quot;Ring&quot; of Blending (don't know how I convinced em.) And so I changd my shape into a taller humaniod resembling the barbarians. I also managed to pull off a very high roll on a tumble check between two barbarians causing them to hit each other. <br />
<br />
I took my chances on some needless crazy stunts, the only reason I didn't get hurt was because (and even the DM admitted it) I was getting very lucky on my rolls.</div></div><hr />
