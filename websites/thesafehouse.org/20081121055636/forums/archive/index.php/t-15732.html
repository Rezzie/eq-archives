WTB, WTS,WTT. Sony needs to come up with a merchant chat channel or something like the bazaar. I thought that this was what the brokers were for but people are to lazy. It is getting so bad that I am about to say screw this game. I know people in EQ1 did it as well but man this is crazy. Trying to keep with the ooc's that actually have relevance and weeding through the spam can become quite the challenge. Not to mention trying to keep up with what a npc may be saying to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">11-22-04, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I wish there was either an enforced /auc channel, or a means to filter text strings containing WTT/WTB/WTS to a designated window that I would have transparent in a 3x3 pixel window offscreen. I have my UI set up to 3 chat windows. One for personal chat (g/r/t/gu); one for all things combat, and one main window for basic game mechanics. The latter has scrolled by unmerciless lately and I'm sick of scrolling back 30 lines to read what an NPC just told me.</div></div><hr />

I cetaintly don't. In EQ1 it typically went on in zones where it was acceptable. I am tired of getting killed or almost killed because I am spending more time filtering through my window than I am on the mobs that are pathing around on me.<br />
<br />
Just as SOE can spam all these messages about server going down, moving players to other servers etc. They can spam a message telling players to use this channel so the rest of us can play the game and work for our items rather than listen to a car salesman.</div></div><hr />

I have four chat windows.. one for general zone chat, one for world channelsand tells, one for my hits and HO's and one for other people's hits. I have no problem with the spam.

The only thing I can suggest is to either get used to it, or turn the channel off. I only use two windows, one for chat and one for everything else. Haven't had a problem, really.</div></div><hr />

This is a multizone problem however. Were it limited to one, it wouldn't bother me so much.<br />
<br />
Edit: And how exactly are you supposed to play the game with /ooc and /shout off?  :crazy</div></div><hr />

<br />
I havent paid attention to ooc, shout or auc in EQ1 in ages, I have a window for it, but its extremely faded, I might even have them turned off now, cant remember.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the same for EQ2 for me, for the most part, I dont really care what other people are chattering about, mostly its just spam with an occasional good question, Ive found so far when I ask for help in ooc, it rarely gets answered, I just look for someone in the area, or pick someone from a /who list and ask them, seems to work a little better (though it seems worse in EQ2 than EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shotoif</div><div class="date">11-22-04, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have effectively pissed off a few hundred or maybe more people today on my server.

<br />
Socially EQ2 is way more cutthroat, selfish, greedy, rude than EQ1 ever was. It isn't the game that is killing it for me it's the players. EQ1 was the opposite for me.</div></div><hr />

Not a big fan of the spamming issue that's happens so much during peak hours.  The worst is when they start debating politics like the other night in Antonica.   :hmph</div></div><hr />

<br />
Largely, I agree.<br />
<br />
The locked encounters and the inability to KS has led to the opposite of it's indended effect in some cases.<br />
<br />
Last night, I was in a full group in Blackburrow killing some spider's for a friend's quest.   There were several groups, and each group was waiting the 15 or so minutes it was taking for the previous group to kill enough spiders and complete the quest.    Then a couple of higher levels came and decided they did not want to wait their turn, they didn't ask if they could join a group and share the quest...they just started to try to engage the mobs as they spawned as fast as they could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shotoif</div><div class="date">11-24-04, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will say that the contraversy I started is making an impact. The spamming has lessened in ooc I think but we will see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix</div><div class="date">11-25-04, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The locked encounters and the inability to KS has led to the opposite of it's indended effect in some cases. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think it is the locked encounters as much as a lot of people in the same level range competing for limited resources in a new game.  Many of those people come from different MMOGs, with different social mores (and for that matter, those vary from server to server even in EQ).  As time passes, rules will spring up to govern behavior and those that violate them will end up ostracized.<br />
<br />
That might mean camps become the accepted norm, a whoever engages first norm, or a mix there of.  I expect the latter.  Certain things will become camps, things not near those spots will be free for all.  Much like EQ, really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you do that?  I tied to go through options, but I didn't see anything that I could click or whatnot to do that.<br />
<br />
Please elaborate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shotoif</div><div class="date">11-25-04, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think when you right click on the chat window it brings up the stuuf you are looking for. No at home on my comp ATM to give better directions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coyoteblack</div><div class="date">11-25-04, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok right click it is. go to options  and there are a varity of channels one of which is quanos traders I fnd it real helpfull on AB anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">11-25-04, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am quite sure the tutorial either on the boat or on the island will tell you how to join channels...<br />
<br />
On the FP side of my server, there is hardly and /ooc and /shout spam at all. The only things that are said in those channels are LFG stuff and an occational question for something in the zone.<br />
<br />
Now the freeport_traders, freeport_crafters and freeport channels - those are being spammed....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joonling</div><div class="date">11-26-04, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:oops <br />
<br />
Don't I feel the fool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess my play style differs.  I've lead groups the last 8 days on EQ2, and have a pretty tight group of friends now in the 8-12 range.  We group every night, and either quest or xp.  In addition, I'm an avid believer in the boards and typically after racking in a couple gold each day I hit the boards before logout each night and bankrupt myself on new spell scrolls.  Therefore, I have zero need for /auction.  <br />
<br />
I tend to ignore /ooc and /shout 100% of the time since I am very focused on leading, and in addition ensuring survival.  <br />
<br />
I don't turn them off but have no difficulty mentally turning myself off to green colored text on my pc unless I specifically enter into a conversation over /ooc.<br />
<br />
My suggestion, focus more.<br />
<br />
I would highly disagree with your opinion of social norms in EQ2.  So far, the people I've grouped with have been completely flexible, and greed has been non-existant.  Also, I'd class the type of player I tend to recruit as hardcore since we are typically playing 6+ hours a night.<br />
