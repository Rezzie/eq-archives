I've been trying to track down a member of this guild ever since I started Vallon Zek and have yet to see or even hear a whisper of one.  Does this guild exist on Vallon? Anyone know how I can reach one of their members? Please?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Frankly</div><div class="date">05-14-01, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, they exist on both Rallos and Vallon.  Go to www.eqrogue.com to get a complete member list on both servers.  <br />
<br />
They're a fine and supportive guild for rogues.  Also one of the most fun ones I've ever been in.  I particularly like the assassination contracts.  <br />
<br />
Very different from the Amazons, though the Amazons are my other favorite guild =)</div></div><hr />

Do you have an Amazon char as well, or do you just like the guild?

Ty=) Tsyndria, Wood Elf scout of the Amazons, Vallon Zek&quot;We are nothing but a whisper on the lips of the wary, and a shadow to those we target.  In essence we do not exist, but make no mistake about it...we are here...and we are watching...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Frankly</div><div class="date">05-14-01, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main on Vallon (a warrior) really wanted to join the Amazons, but at the time all the officers were in Kunark and she was bound in Queynos, so I couldn't run my quest to get in =(.  Soon after the loot rules changed, my heart was broken, and I wandered off to Rallos to start over again from scratch.  Rogue this time!  (Got the class right at last.)<br />

Amazons have always gotten my vote for the sanest and most helpful bunch of people. Edited by: Frankly at: 5/14/01 6:15:23 pm</div></div><hr />

Shoot I remember grouping with him when minotaurs in the Gorges were still red to us both.  I've never seen a halfling's corpse scattered around the gates of Neriak as much as his.<br />
<br />
Nah, Vallon's not for me anymore.  There's a perfectly good chapter of Black Rose on Rallos, and I live for the excitement of item-loot PvP. Edited by: Frankly at: 5/15/01 2:20:02 pm</div></div><hr />
