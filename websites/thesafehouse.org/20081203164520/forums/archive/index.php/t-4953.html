<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Daenrys Blackthorne</div><div class="date">03-12-02, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stealth 40 - any idea of &quot;natural&quot; skill number is factored higher than skill with items?<br />
<br />
Slashing 34 - realized I'm not really planning to use too many base weapon styles as they are set up to chain as nicely as the CS ones seem to be<br />
<br />
Envenom 40 - Planning to go this high puts me at the 2nd highest poison for 3 categories, I am going to have DoT on my main hand, the Strength debuff on the left hand, and a dagger with snare on it for runners in my bag.<br />
<br />
Critical Strike 39 - Opening with 21 -&gt; 34 -&gt; 39,  then 18 -&gt; 25 till death or panic flee starts.  If he turns to flee - most people are too panicked to run through you - ill be swapping in my snare dagger to snare.  I did think about investing in the 44, 50 styles - but I decided I wasn't going to spend that many spec points on a style that starts out with an uncontrollable action (evade).   Even at this level I can throw in a 12 -&gt; 29 post evade.<br />
<br />
Dual Wield  36 - not going for styles here - going for damage add.  At 36 - I will be hitting a 43% chance of nailing the 2nd weapon, if what I read is correct about each point in DW bringing up my chance to hit by .5%<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that with the debuff/dot plus higher DW - I won't be losing too much damage-wise by not taking CS to 50 in the long haul, cause I think the opportunity to run the full Ripper combo is gonna be relatively rare (cause he should be dead before I get to that last style unless I manage to evade at the very beginning).<br />
<br />
So I'm shooting for solid damage, with some flexibility with poisons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TlaaraSF</div><div class="date">03-17-02, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like a sweet template, although I would personally be more inclined to switch your Spec amounts between Thrust/Slash and DW.<br />
<br />
As far as I understand it, CS damage is effected (at least the minimum) by your training in your Primary Weapon (Similar to Polearms/ 2 Handed weapons for tanks)<br />
<br />
What I want, is for Mythic to get their finger out and show what spellcrafting will do. Then we can all rest a bit easier with our templates and training.<br />
<br />
Until they do, I'll be shooting for 40 Stealth (Confident I can hit 50 With +Stlth Items and + RPoint bonus)<br />
<br />
44 Crit Strike<br />
<br />
39 Thrust.<br />
<br />
40 Envenom (and pray)<br />
<br />
And Around 20-25 Dual Wield (I forget my template off the top of my head)<br />
