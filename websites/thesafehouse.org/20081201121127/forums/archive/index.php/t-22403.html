<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sablehawk</div><div class="date">01-16-06, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings,<br />
<br />
My name is Sablehawk and I am the guild leader for The Crimson Wind Society.  <br />
<br />
Crimson Wind members are mature and respectful, willing to share their wealth and assist guild members in all things. We are not only a community, but a family, concerned for each other’s well-being, and dedicated to the guild. We expect our members to be respectful and polite to all those they meet in the world of Telon. Ninja looting, kill stealing, camp whoring, whining and begging are not acceptable. Being a part of our community, knowing fellow guild members’ skill and abilities, grouping together, sharing recipes and items, and posting on the guild website are expected.<br />
<br />
In the spirit of Vanguard, we have three distinct Corps for members to choose from which will be based on the Sphere they wish to concentrate on. Aptly named, Adventure Corps, Quartermaster Corps, and Diplomatic Corps, each will have distinct titles that reflect the nature of the Sphere.<br />
<br />
Within each Corps, Squads will be established based on what each member prefers to spend their time doing. Examples include the Adventure Corps Protectors Squad for those that enjoy guarding Diplomats and Harvesters, and the Explorers Squad for those that enjoy exploring every nook and cranny of the world. In our Quartermaster Corps, the Scythe Squad for those that wish to harvest their own resources to be used for their crafts, and the Emporium Squad for those that wish to concentrate primarily on crafting.<br />
<br />
For those members equally interested in all Spheres, Elite Squads will also be formed. An Elite Squad is self-sufficient in that they will be able to adventure, harvest, craft, and handle diplomatic situations. Elite Squad members will have complimentary classes across all spheres. This means they will consist of an appropriate mix of adventure classes, at least one of each type of harvester, at least one of each type of Diplomat, and a mix of crafting trades that will allow the Squad to repair their broken cart or imbue the Squad’s weapons among other things that will need to be done while adventuring. Elite Squads will be established by members, and approved by the Council, based on when and how they play. Elite Squad Leaders will have a voice on the Council.<br />
<br />
All guild members, not only Elite Squads, are encouraged to group together as much as possible and to assist each other in all aspects of the game from completing quests and obtaining items to the final crafting assembly which will in most cases require at least one component from another trade.<br />
<br />
We encourage members to concentrate on one character. We understand the desire to create alts, however, we are dedicated players who take pride in their main and spend the majority of our time on that character. We know little about what the guild cap will actually be, though however high it is, we will be limiting the number alts that will carry the guild name.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to stop by our website and contribute to our forums. Additional information about ranks, structure, and ideals can be found there in the About Us, Guild Ranks, Application, Forum Rules, and In Game Rules sections.<br />
<br />
We look forward to meeting you.<br />
<br />
Commander Sablehawk, The Crimson Wind Society Leader<br />
Captain Stromgard, Adventure Corps Leader<br />
Master Kelaric, Quartermaster Corps Leader</div></div><hr />

Well its been a while now, but the item we felt put us over the top was the &quot;Batwing&quot; that we used. Fortunately we had a couple of females on our team and they used a certain feminine product with 'wings' that we just had to include.<br />
<br />
By the way if there are any pirate lovers out there looking for a guild, this future gnome/rogue pirate wants to hear from you! Argggh!<br />
