If you say ANYTHING and then hail them again, they will not reply.  If you hit ESC then re-select them and hail, they will answer again, but as soon as you say anything they once again stop hailing.<br />

I doubt it will help at all, but perhaps they're unwilling to just chatter out in the open about the dark arts.</div></div><hr />

Looking at the other trader skills it looks like we need to find an other person or two that will sell=give us the poison recipies ... but no luck so far.. hopefully some one figures something put while im at work or tonight i spend hailing every darn npc in PoK.</div></div><hr />

Nothing yet. I have not tried the elevator room yet, nor any of the buildings out side of the library.. (actually I did check the buildings that have ramps to the library... with the sages on the top floor .. mainly small trade skill quests (brewing and baking and research).

The middle one was especially intriguing since he says something like &quot;Unless you are a master poison maker, I dunnae want anythin to do with you.&quot;  So, trying to convince him that I was worthy, I summoned a bag with the grandmaster item and tried to give it to them, but nothing.  Even tried handing them the grandmaster vial itself.<br />
<br />
Will keep looking, but keep the summoned bag in mind if someone finds an NPC asking for proof of skill.<br />

No reply, but he did yawn.  Yawns every time you say what advanced poisons.  A little closer it seems, but I'm not having much luck otherwise.  I don't have the planar manual yet, so that may be one reason.  I do tend to think that the sketch book is the recipe book. &amp;lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=341696&quot; resize=&quot;yes&quot; *****&quot;text-decoration:none&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; toolbar=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Depen Dank&amp;lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;Br&gt; Assassin of Druzzil Ro</div></div><hr />

I'll try to give that a shot tonight in various combinations, but I highly doubt it.  Then again, me trying the Parchment and Quills was a stupidly long shot, too, but I tried anyway.  ;p<br />

Also, when I tried giving 1000pp to the vendor who yawns, he neither said nor did anything.<br />

<br />
I haven't gotten into Valor to get the Valor Crystals necessary to attempt the Stealth quest; the one attempt I was in to try the Justice trials was terribly disorganized at first, then the plane crashed, then my house lost power.  ;p  Anyone know offhand if the Valor Crystals are NODROP?</div></div><hr />
