<br />
I found 2 of the druids but can't find 3rd one of figure out how to get to the waterfall. Walked the zone 3x now, checked back with the head druid, still lost *sigh*<br />
<br />
Spent the last couple of days trying to figure it out!<br />
<br />
Guess there's a reason I'm a blonde...hehe.<br />
<br />

Druid 2 is in a cocoon in the spider cave, in the room with the queen spider.<br />
Druid 3 is in a dungeon at the witches house (and I'd be inclined to leave the arrogant priss there myself....)</div></div><hr />

After talking to her I was seriously looking for some way I could put her back.  If I'd been playing my thief instead of my Paladin I'd have probably robbed her and just left her there with the witch.<br />
<br />
And she didn't even look that good.    Glip the Gnome<br />

<br />
she was too vain by far!<br />
<br />
I am a dork, I thought the whole map was cleared, it wasn't so I did not see the little gold ring for a zoneline! <br />
<br />
by far, a major doh on my part!</div></div><hr />
