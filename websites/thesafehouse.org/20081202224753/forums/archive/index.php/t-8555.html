Had a friend that did the same thing you did since she thought she would never get epic...we ran her through epic in 2 hours, got everything, did general and she couldnt turn stuff in for 2 days because she had to fix her faction :lol<br />
<br />
According to allakhazam link durden posted can kill molon in neriak 3rd gate too, but if your DE you'll lose ebon mask faction real fast =/</div></div><hr />

HANDING in the Orc Scalp will for this quest, or you could do the gnoll scalp quest too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jball69</div><div class="date">06-17-03, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">another idea is to get good at turn ins the same way you do it for the general  invs up to him click invis off open trade window invs on and hit trade you will get no argo this way max kos or not. i did my whole high elf mask quest max kos to stanos and never got argo once you just have to have a friend come along and say &quot; i need to see stanos&quot; to spawn him. gl quest is way easier than it looks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hortaror Jaesis</div><div class="date">06-20-03, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually i found a much better way to get orc scalps. they now drop in crushbone, and they are cheap off merchants if newbies sell them. course i cant do it cuase it ruins fraction with the inkies and i dont have the bottom parchment. man i wish i hadnt killed guards!!!</div></div><hr />

omg if i hear one more &quot;kill orc&quot; i'm going to kill my self. <br />
<br />
k kids listen up fastest way =)<br />
<br />
fill up with 8 EMPTY bags. head to Qeynos, head to the rog guild. and look for someone forgot name. and say what &quot;what shipment&quot; he will give you a card. keep saying this intill your bags are full of them. now wait till 12am. a dark elf will pop on the side of the castle, outside. b/c your a &quot;rog&quot; SNECK behind him and turn in the cards. and keep doing this. <br />
<br />
I play on a Pvp server and there are soemthing called faction burning. so i loss gain and loss faction in HHK all the time b/c its a war zone. and exp zone. <br />
any how where i'm tring to get at is. <br />
<br />
4 runs. will take you max KOS to indi <br />
4 more runs will give you max ally. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hortaror Jaesis</div><div class="date">06-23-03, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">4 runs wont do it, i did it roughly 6 times with 6 backpacks and im still apprehensively. was a good way to spam the zone and now 1 guard has roughly 1k notes on him mwuahahahah. one minor problem i encountered with that is that a guard named Letinuet Dagarok killed me twice. He was bugged the day i ran into him and killed me with one 200 slash (1k hp then) and he fears, so watch out for that one. Guess I'll try it again...</div></div><hr />
