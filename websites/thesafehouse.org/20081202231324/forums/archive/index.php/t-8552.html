<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Breakious</div><div class="date">05-09-03, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, im here with a quick question that some of u may know the answer too.<br />
<br />
Is Founy Jestands in Kaladim broken?  <br />
<br />
Right now, im on spawn #11...yes ELEVEN!  No stained parchament so far.  If he is indeed broken, i want get go back to xping...im running out of Anime to watch  <br />
<br />
On a side note, ive completed my epic, and have done this before (got on the 3rd or so).  Everyone i talked to got the parchament at least by the 4th or 5th.  Im also picking till i get about 40-50 unseccessful messages or agro.    <br />
<br />
P.S. That new dorf Crovsar Kirkbringer is a pain in the ass.  Already ate 1 unrezzed death :&quot;&gt;</div></div><hr />

I have no problem, got it on the 2nd pick a few days ago (2nd time i tried it, first time was on 3rd pick)<br />
I think i should try to get it again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">05-10-03, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">he's not bugged, it's just random.  First time doing epic it took around 7 tries.  This time around while doing high elf mask it took 6 tries.  Some get it sooner, some later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tzanntiel</div><div class="date">05-10-03, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did Founy just a few weeks ago, and he worked fine for me. First time into Kaladim, first time I saw him spawn (he wasn't up when I first walked in) 5th PP attempt, and I had my note.<br />
<br />
Patience, and luck! I wish you good luck on both. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Breakious</div><div class="date">05-12-03, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thankfully the spawn wasn't broken.  Could have fooled me tho, since i didn't get the parchament till the 15th spawn!  That has to be a record  <br />
<br />
The madness didn't end there...<br />
<br />
Day 1: Camped Eldreth for 5 hours...had to go eat.  Came back and he wasn't up!  Camped for another 4 hours...fell asleep at keyboard.<br />
Day 2: Camped Eldreth for 4 hours...finally popped!  <br />
<br />
What are the chances that 2+ rogues also wanted to do this part at the same time!<br />
<br />
The madness continues...<br />
<br />
Day 1: Book of Soul NOT in the PoH when i port up.  I gate out and xp grind.<br />
Day 2: Book of Soul NOT in the PoH when i port up.  I gate out and xp grind.<br />
Day 3: Finally up...<br />
<br />
And more...<br />
<br />
Renux fight lasted a record breaking 2 hour+ minutes.  65 wizard, 65 rogue (myself), 65 monk COULD NOT KILL HER.  Everytime she was just about to die, we got that &quot;How does if feel to have your heart handed to you by a woman&quot;  @#%$.  How did we do it u ask?<br />
<br />
1) We had the wizard go all out with the nukes and snares.  Enough that he would never lose agro...ever.<br />
2) Then he solo kited Renux till he got 90m!! (this took a @#%$ long time)<br />
3) Then Monk and myself proceeded to melee.  Once Renux was at 1 bub or so, wizard Mana Burn ... &gt;_&amp;lt;<br />
<br />
And to bring the night to a close...<br />
<br />
65 rogue, 65 bard, 65 monk, 65 wizard, 55 cleric, 60 warrior, Wiped to the DEs 2 times.  First was a horrific pull of destruction and the second was because of General V'ghera agro.<br />
<br />
But, i finally have my HIE mask.  <br />
<br />
And ppl seem to think Stanos is the hard part of this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">05-12-03, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe I hope you aren't on Nameless, if you are, sorry.. myself and a few others have been redoing the epic for the high elf mask, also, so the book wouldn't be up, Eldreth wouldn't be up, etc..<br />
<br />
I did Renux with a 65 mage.. unorthodox but it worked.  I would tank her while his pet would pound away.  At lvl 65 with around 170 svp, the stun was resisted each time.  Then the mage would overnuke to steal aggro then run in circles while the pet and I would attack from behind, which is a bit difficult when she isn't snared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cinzia Dakhor</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, i wanted to know if renux can be soloed from a mage.<br />
I spawned renux and let my 64 mage friend kill her. was not really long fight. we had a ranja for track and a druid also there (if things will go wrong and we have to meele).<br />
Mage took out his mini earth pets at the beginning then i think the dragon pet also. as the mage was nuking much, the druid healed the pet a few times, but the pet has so much HPs that it was really easy.<br />
'§&amp;amp;*$ mages are overpowerd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Took me 5 trips to Kaladim and about 15 RL-hours until he finally gave his @#%$ note to me.  <br />
<br />
I hate him with a passion...<br />
<br />
<br />
Renux: 65 druid + 65 rogue<br />
<br />
Took about 5 mins max... I triggered, Druid snared right away and got aggro - he never lost it. Druid doted, I meleed her while we kited her around.<br />
<br />
*shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cinzia Dakhor</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">mage can do that faster, also with only lvl 64 and i think without all lvl 63-64 spells.<br />
i say only mass pets</div></div><hr />

A 65 druid snared her and kept using his stun dd spell on her to keep agro and I just walked along stabbing her.  Took 4-5 minutes and I was unbuffed.  Now if I can just get Stanos' head I'd be happy.<br />
<br />
As for the parchments a couple friends of mine have been trying for over a week.  I think one is on try 10 or so. Its just bad luck.  I got mine first spawn with only a few tries..  tho the first time I did it I had to go thru like 3 spawns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_JakiilMT</div><div class="date">05-22-03, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My epic has thusfar been torn directly from the pages of &quot;The Born Loser&quot;.<br />
<br />
First, the 2 parchments didn't pick for nearly 2 RL days (with breaks in between for normal human sleep). Founy gave it up on day 3, and Tani continued to aggro after the 3rd pick for another 4 days. Granted, I stopped trying continually after the 100th pp attempt, aggro, run to zone, die, rez, try again.<br />
<br />
Elated beyond belief, I scoop up my new parchment bottom and head to Highpass Hold. Guess who's not around? Yup. Stanos NOR Anson are up. Lots of smugglers, btm at 51, so I thought I'd better not attack one yet. Someone told me, &quot;Maybe the smuggler will despawn, so hang out a while&quot;. 4 hours later, smug smuggler is still looking at me indifferently.<br />
<br />
Then it occurs to me... parchment TOP is in the BANK! Doh. Well, being on a self-fulfilling losing streak, I run all the way to PoK to get it... out of...the...bank, that was right in HHK... had I looked.<br />
<br />
Okies. This is the born loser, with no Stanos, just can't wait to see how the rest of my Freebringer goes... :/</div></div><hr />

Founy despawned the bassard, so I figured I'd go rob the other stoopid dorfs in town. Well much to my surprise, Exterminator Vinn (2nd dorf from the right after entering KalNorth) Had Top part! Perhaps a bug, but definitely worth tryin to PP this guy, esp while you are waitin on Founy respawns.<br />

Did you mean the 4th failure after you take his money?<br />

<br />
After reading how (manaburn?!), I can safely say you dragged out a 10 minute battle majorly.<br />
<br />
The only reason Renux does this is WHEN A MELEE IS HITTING WHEN SHE GETS BELOW 10%.<br />
<br />
If either were still hitting Renux, she healed herself.  What you do is melee her to 11% (or 10% if you time it right), and then let the wizard just plain nuke her.  Simple as that.  BTW: stun will not work.  We lost a 65 chanter trying that in a different attempt.  Just snarekite until 10% health or so, then let fly the bombs.<br />
<br />
Manaburn...Well, I guess that WOULD be an effective stress reliever after that long a chase of Renux.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, as far as pickpocketting the parchments...it's always been a wide-ranged random thing.  Got mine from Jouny the second time.  Took something like SEVENTEEN spawns from Tani.<br />
<br />
Not broke.  However, like seemingly gimp rolls, we rogues can get seemingly gimp picks.<br />
<br />
I'll tell you what though, I&quot;m tempted to pickpocket those notes again and sell them in the bazaar for all the trouble they're causing.   <br />
<br />
Nah.</div></div><hr />

I dont even know how many times I tried to Pick Pocket this dumb Dwarf.  I must have let him spawn and despawn 25 times.<br />
     Tani wasn't any better at all.  I just kept pickpocketting him for days.  Last night I was so tired after literally a full RL day of pickpocketting.  I fell asleep at the keyboard like 4 times, I was camping out, and changed my mind.  I had Pick pocketted 20+t times after the last CP so I said, one more can't hurt.  I hit the button and there it was!  The little %&amp;amp;($ dropped it for me.  I was psyched and ran to HighPass.  Turned in the items there (He was up and waiting).  I ran to Lake rath with the same results!<br />
     The spawns being up and waiting was a welcome change for me, I am actually starting my epic entirly over because the general despawned on our last fight with him.</div></div><hr />

     When I did Renux the last time I had a 52 Necro, 54 Shaman, and a 54 Cleric and a 53 Ranger.  We just kited her, took MAYBE 7 minutes tops.</div></div><hr />
