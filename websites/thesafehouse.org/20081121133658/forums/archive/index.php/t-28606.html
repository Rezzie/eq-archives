Guild Website: http://finalfury.guildportal.com<br />

We are a family based guild that started in early EQ as Obsidian Circle of Power. We carried the same name over to EQ2 and just recently changed it to Final Fury for the release of Vanguard. Our main priority is that all of our members, weither they be MMO veterans or newbies, feels welcome and IMPORTANT! Not just another member with a guild tag over their head, but a family member that is an intricate part of our guild.<br />
<br />
We are currently looking for all races/classes to join us! Crafters and Diplomats are MORE than welcome!<br />
<br />
The majority of our communication is through our website. All members will need to be able to access our website and keep up to date with the information held within!<br />
<br />
We are not an uber raiding guild. Raids are in our future, but are not a huge priority. Raids can be requested via our webpage with the appropriate guild rank, in which case we will do everything possible to make sure it happens. As of this time we do not have voice chat, but that too may be a possibility in the future!<br />
<br />
If interested in joining us please visit our website or send me an in-game tell!</div></div><hr />
