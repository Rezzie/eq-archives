<br />
1. <br />
In order to get this quest, you must be able to speak dwarven.  Dane Steelfist (near the innkeeper) says that he's swamped being a bureaucrat and needs help getting things done.  If you agree to help him out, he'll give you a quest to kill 5 Lowland Badgers in Antonica.  After you've finished that, come back and talk to him again.  He'll then send you back out for another kill task.  Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Reward: a selection of boots ranging from very light to medium armor <br />
<br />
Antonica<br />
<br />
1. Half-eaten Order Slip<br />
<br />
This is a random drop off any animal/gnoll you kill in Antonica. Once you get it, examine it and accept the quest.  You will be instructed to go talk to Farmer Alcott; he's the only NPC standing in the fields near NQ bridge.  He will ask you to kill 2 scarecrows.  After you do, go back to talk to him.<br />
<br />
Reward: Belt --- AC 13, +1 str, +1 wis, +1 agi, +11 magic, +16 poison<br />
<br />
2. Frontier Lady's Task P. 1 <br />
<br />
Talk to Dancer, a female NPC standing near the Claymore Monument.  Hail her and she asks you to run an errand to Sighard Sayer.  He's located in the 2nd floor in the right corner of the trading post (at the crossroads).  After you talk to him, run back to Dancer.<br />
<br />
Reward: coin (can't remember how much)<br />
<br />
 Frontier Lady's Task P.2 <br />
<br />
After you tell Dancer that you've accomplished her first task, she will ask you to do another favor for her.  A friend of hers was killed and buried in Archer Woods.  She wants you to take a green arrow and place it on the grave of her friend --- his grave  marker is a dummy at the base of the largest tree in the woods.  Can't miss it --- it's also the same tree you use for &quot;A Vision of Coldwind Point&quot; quest.<br />
<br />
Reward: Oaken Ring of Trusaris (1agi, 2wis, 6health, 2power, 12ac) <br />
<br />
Battle with the Timberclaws<br />
<br />
This is the third and final task you do for Dancer.  She asks you to kill 12 timberclaw gnolls in the middle of Archer Woods.  They only spawn at night, though there is one lone gnoll that does spawn during the day.  After killing them, you return and tell her.  <br />
<br />
Reward: Green Arrow Necklace AC 1 - 25 (max at level 24),+9 vs poison +4 vs cold +4 sta +15 power +17 health +3 vs heat, +4 int, +1 str<br />
<br />
Oakmyst<br />
<br />
You speak to the Druid Scholar, Judge, and Empress near the Oakmyst Bears.<br />
<br />
Druid Scholar --- asks you to find a nutrient that will help heal the small treant sapling running around.  After you find it (it's in the scribe shop in Nettleville behind a scribe on a bookcase) you return and tell her. She sends you to give it to the treant sapling, then says to speak to the Judge.<br />
<br />
Druid Judge --- asks you to kill Summer Sprites because they are a corrupting influence.  After doing so, she tells you to speak to the Empress.<br />
<br />
Druid Empress --- tells you about the Weedrot in the corrupted druid cave on the hill.  She asks you to kill weedrot and free the druids from its evil clutches.  It's a hard fight so be prepared with at least 3-4 people, especially a healer.  The weedrot can hit and hit HARD.  I did it at 15 and died twice with a lvl 17 druid who also died.<br />
<br />
Reward: gloves (really nice ones)<br />
<br />
North Qeynos<br />
<br />
1. Bear Fashion<br />
<br />
Talk to Rachel Clothspinner in the tailor shop.  She asks you to get 4 Oakmyst Bear pelts so that she can make clothing with.<br />
<br />
Reward: greaves that range from very light armor to medium armor<br />
<br />
2.  Some Nice Bear Hides<br />
<br />
Talk to Daniella Clothspinner in the back of the tailor shop.  She asks you to kill 4 bears in Antonica for their hides.  When you return, amidst much rejoicing, she gives you:<br />
<br />
Reward: shoulder piece ranging from very light to medium armor<br />
<br />
Down Below<br />
<br />
1. Intriguing Eye<br />
<br />
First, go to the down below, and find one of the mechants (they are near the zone-ins from the starting cities, baubbleshire, nettleville, etc.). Behind the merchant, there should be a stack of books. Inspect the stack of books, and read an ink-stained note you find in one book (the book is also used for &quot;Valen's Stolen Books&quot; quest)<br />
<br />
This is the access quest for the zone &quot;Crow's Resting Place&quot;. The quest takes place mostly in the down below, with some running up to various city zones as well. Every step of this quest is easily soloable, with the exception of the final step, which requires killing a fallen noble. The fallen nobles are level 11-12 group ^^ mobs, and they come 2 at a time. It was too much for me to kill by myself, but I found a couple of other adventurers to help me out.<br />
<br />
Once you have completed the access quest, click on the hand statue in down below to zone into Crow's Resting Place. Crow's is a very small zone, and is a base for operations for the Circle of Unseen Hands. Inside this zone, you will find Fippy Darkpaw the 4th. Talk to Fippy. He will tell you about how you won him a bet, and also insult you some.  This also triggers an attack from a few of the rogues milling about, so be careful.<br />
<br />
 Stout Merchant Manifest<br />
<br />
After talking to Fippy some, and giving him the right answers, he will give you a quest to collect signatures from tavern owners in Qeynos. It seems fippy, like his esteemed ancestor, is smuggling booze into Qeynos. He wants to you take around his ledger book and get signatures from his customers. The book doesn't give much detail on where to find each customer, but it isn't too hard to figure out.  Read below if you want a spoiler.<br />
<br />
[spoiler:643be6b726]Go to Gomit Penwiggle in Baubbleshire, then Propieter Blagurd in Starcrest Commune, Karg Icemoe in Graystone Yard, Borden Manus in Qeynos Harbor, and P.T. Irontoe in North Qeynos[/spoiler:643be6b726]<br />
<br />
Once you have the signatures all collected, return to Fippy for more insults, as well as your much deserved reward:<br />
<br />
Reward: Nighthide Tunic, light armor, AC 86 (at level 19, its 64 for me at 16), +5 agi, +3 str, +12 health, +12 power</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxtor</div><div class="date">12-01-04, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another item of note on the insightful eye quest.<br />
After recieving the book from Fippy BUT BEFORE READING IT, kill the mobs/npcs in the room. Not fippy, but all the others. The guy standing next to Fippy is the toughest, and he was blue at lvl 15 to me. Easily soloable though.  2 new &quot;guards&quot; will be by both doors. kill them as well. You will get a chest with book/books in it. <br />
Then read the book from fippy.<br />
<br />
Talk to Constable Arathur and then fippy and you will have 2 breast plates, almost the exact same stats, but not exaxctly.  I did it this way and gave my gf the other breast plate<br />

I was wondering how that happened.  When the guys spawned, I was trying to fight them off while my group stood there and watched me get spanked.  Only after I died did they do anything....damn pickup groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />

 Of course it depends what you have, but I would think yes. For instance at lvl 15 I still have my Hunter boots, an upgrade prior to the lvl 20 armor quests will be a good thing  :) <br />
<br />
It looks to me that several of these armor quests will provide gear that will serve well in the high teens and into the low 20s while working on the next set of upgrades.<br />
