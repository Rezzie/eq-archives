We are having a discussion about the DPS of the Knight classes at the Ranger's Glade, and many of the senior SKs are making some ludicrous statements their DPS not coming close to that of us Rangers. Since you guys are the &quot;masters&quot; of DPS, maybe you can jump over and help us out?<br />
<br />
Do any of you have some actual parses from high-end mobs that you might be able to share with us?</div></div><hr />

I know a very well equipped SK could hit 90ish, using spells at our disposal, and maybe 110 if you are Ubah, using pet, spells, buffed, behind the mob, and very lucky. Keep in mind that it is mana dependant, and pet dependant. So it is not a constant, like a rogue sitting behind a mob, or a mage tossing fireballs, and /pet attacking.<br />
<br />
As far as us SKs holding info from you rogues and rangers.. we JUST got fixed, why in the heck should we tell everything to you and get nerfed again? We still get owned in melee DPS by rangers and rogues, as it should be. So quitcherbitchin, eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why don't you go check the monk boards?  They are just as concerned with DPS as you are, if not more so and probably wouldn't be too hard to get them all riled up on you side since they are also looking for people to bash... Khuzdul - Cleric<br />

My husband is a half epiced 58 ranger 6 aaxp and I have a lv <br />
61 sk with 23 aaxp and epic. We attack the same mob...Guess who can KS the other??<br />
Sure I can KS a mob from him nuking lifetapping and HT but after that one mob is dead and I am LOM guess what? Ranger does more damage.<br />
You seem to forget that SK melee skills and offense cap much much lower than Rangers.<br />
A ranger whining about SK dps gets no symphaty from me, nor probably from anybody who has played a SK.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Khaunshar</div><div class="date">01-08-03, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lvl 65 SK, 120+ AAs, Emperor Sword, Vengeance 14 total, Avatar, in the same group as similar equipped rogues (with bard songs etc.), parsed on a Kaas Thox Vi Aten Ha ra (thats one of the 2 Aten blobs) 98 DPS. Rogues with Khalshazar / AHB, same buffs, Vengeance 11, parsed 131 DPS.<br />
<br />
No pet counted.<br />
<br />
Spear of Decay, Ignite Blood, Blood of Hate, Zevfeers Bite were always used when recycled, full spell crit AAs and Focus effect/song, in the end thats AT LEAST the same DPS as that rogue.<br />
<br />
Now, the rogue couldnt backstab all the time, so he sort of lost half his backstab damage. Also, the SK had to buff/rebuff aggro, and Shroud of Chaos ( such a fool) midfight.<br />
Proc damage clearly favors SK (195 self imbue)<br />
<br />
In the end, I'd say with Luclin gear, but PoP spells, a SK can get pretty close to any rogue, higher than a lot of monks (all this for the limited timespan that the mana lasts, about 25 minutes for me with best mana regen buffs and FT 11) and certainly higher than any dual wielding ranger.<br />
<br />
Then again, if we're talking about a 2hander using ranger, thats a different league altogether.<br />
<br />
the big advantage of SKs over pure melee, at this time, is the fact that the above mentioned spells from PoP were a BIG boost in DPS, while so far superior weapons havent really turned up.<br />
<br />
Btw, IMO thats the reason for this whole problem with casters outdamaging melee etc. Every class with spells operates at lvl 64/65 performance since those are easy to come by, while pure melee still use the gear they used at lvl 60 for the most part.<br />
<br />
I'd expect the &quot;ranking&quot; of DPS to change substantially for elemental planes / plane of time.<br />

<br />
Have you actually looked at the refresh rates on the &quot;uber dd's&quot; SK's have now?<br />
<br />
Oh, and did you notice that the SK archery cap is 70?  Look at the offensive skill caps for the classes.  Shadow Knights are a survival/utility class - we have tools to survive AoE DDs/DoTs/etc and get mostly anywhere without assistance.  As a class, SKs are focused on aggro (yay, there is *finally* a vision for the class), not dps.  Shadow Knights are not a dps class.  Anyone that plays the class to be a dps machine is mistaken.  We can generate damage, but not Rogue-like damage (unless you're comparing a 60 pre-epic rogue to a 65 post-VT SK...). Baron Rhowne &quot;Bloody Teeth&quot; Frozenflame<br />

It takes about 3 times the AA cost to produce a small fraction of the damage of an AM3/Endless quiver ranger.<br />

You guys are a discredit to your community.  I'm glad there are those at the Ranger's Glade that conveniently and en masse, point you tools out for us.<br />

SHADOW KNIGHTS are TANKS, they get PLATE armour, they are not ment to do as much dmg as other melee, same as paladin's<br />
<br />
RANGERS arn't great tanks, we get CHAIN armour, but we also get Atk buffs, which help us reach a better DPS then most other classes.</div></div><hr />
