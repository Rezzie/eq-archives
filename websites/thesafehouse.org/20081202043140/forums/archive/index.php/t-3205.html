<br />
If you make them and give them to your closest friends no one cares but I believe (and I&quot;m NOT a lawyer so I could totally be wrong) freely distributing copies of things that are copywrited by someone else is illegal.<br />
<br />
Just giving you a heads up, you might want to check into things before re-creating copywrited material. Ester The Tester</div></div><hr />

Anyways, there will be minor differances in layout, spelling etc.. last thing I want is Sony knocking at my door unless it's for a job!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up though, and Glip thanks for the spelling correction.  <br />

<br />
In fact, the only reason I wouldn't choose to do something like this is because you're stuck within somebody else's realm of fiction.  Less creative freedom.  More, uh... fanficity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_EsterTheTester</div><div class="date">06-26-02, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to break it to you but if it's recognisable they will be knocking on your door.  Honestly it would be better to try to do something origional that is your own than try to re-create Norrath.<br />
<br />
I would guess that the Sony lawyers (and yes they are as good as their reputation) will be watching for these types of things. Ester The Tester</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_VERY LOW SODIUM</div><div class="date">06-27-02, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. Just like it would be terrible if VI ever stole anything from TSR  .<br />
<br />
If you are going copy it, change it just enough. <br />
<br />
As far as creative works go, Norrath would be a far shot from my first choice to derive from. IMHO, there are just so many superior creative works out there to draw (steal) from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_kiyotee</div><div class="date">06-27-02, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's right you definately shouldn't try to recreate EQ officially. Just like I shouldn't be trying to recreate the pool of Radiance module.<br />
<br />
Actually no we shouldn't be but using it amongst a couple friends is different than spreading it to anyone on the net who wants it. so just keep your circulation low and I would think they won't mind too much, but be ready to yank it down if you get someone knocking on your door.</div></div><hr />

Not given up hope though, have to create a few tilesets first.<br />

I'd think you might be able to take the world converter from hackersquest to convert to a 3D program and then edit the models to place into NWN modules?  (Yeah, I&quot;m sure this would get you sued or something. but lets play theoretical.) --------------------------<br />
