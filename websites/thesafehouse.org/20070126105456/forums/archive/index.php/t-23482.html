Was wondering what talent build &amp; armor/ weapon choices would be best to suit a lvl 19 rogue for battle grounds.<br />
<br />

thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khype</div><div class="date">04-06-06, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you have like 10 skill points to spend, I'd say something like:<br />
<br />
5 master of deception<br />
3 improved gouge<br />
2 improved sinister strike<br />
<br />
Which makes you hard to spot great and gives you the increased gouge stun plus cheaper energy SS.  Most of the other stuff isn't worth it if you only have 10 points to spend.  Stuff like dodge, criticals, stealth speed or whatever else may be good for PvE stuff but in PvP BGs you just need to be able to hide and when you are visible get a quick combo point or two in when you aren't gouging someone out of commision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">04-06-06, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">either this http://www.wowhead.com/talent/?ihZMZ0x<br />
or maybe this http://www.wowhead.com/talent/?wZG0V<br />
<br />
I dunno, tough to decide with 10 points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tinchei</div><div class="date">09-01-06, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree with Khype on the build he just posted. At around lvl 19 unless you have like a badass dagger, your best options are swords or maces and you would want the imp SS to do SS more. But if you had yourself a really good dagger like the Assassin's Blade http://www.thottbot.com/?i=12802 then I would go<br />
<br />
5 Master of Deception<br />
5 Opportunity (for Backstabs and Ambush)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bubba</div><div class="date">10-12-06, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first question is do you have a 60 to run your level 15 I hope alt through instances? Just running him through over and over will force him to level.<br />
<br />
What race are you? Alliance or Horde? <br />
I would pick Gnome for Alliance nothing beats Escape Artist for a Rogue or Warrior.<br />
If you go horde Undead for the Will of the Forsaken (Awesome Fear Ward), Cannabalize (regen HP off corpses) and Underwater Breathing which can be put to good use if you creative. Underwater breathing is no help in WSG thou.<br />
<br />
Armor you can thottbot it ;-p<br />
<br />
Weapons Crusader, Lifestealing or +15 Agi only for a twink.<br />
Shadow Fang- 2.70 spd 17.8 dps Sword plus chance to inflict 30 shadow damage. Very good blade. A little fast but DPS is much higher than 2 below<br />
<br />
Stinging Viper- 2.80 spd 15.5dps Mace very low speed very good for sinister strike + chance to poison.<br />
<br />
Cruel Barb- 2.80 spd 15.5dps Sword same stats as above but +12 Attack Power<br />
<br />
Off Hand or Macro to switch after backstab to sword or mace in main hand.<br />
I would choose Assassins Blade. Very fast, great DPS, get Lifestealing. It will proc alot for you.<br />
<br />
Other Enchants<br />
Enchant Gloves Superior Agi +15<br />
Enchant Bracer Superior Sta +9<br />
Enchant Chest Superior Stats +4 Stats<br />
Enchant Boots Minor Spd Helps Alot in WSG<br />
Enchant Cloak Your Preferance Stealth I would think<br />
<br />
Go Engineering You can look it up<br />
Explosive Sheep are Uber Fun!!<br />
Any bomb that AoEs is nice for a rogue or warrior. Pulls rival rogues out of stealth.<br />
<br />
Googles gives you stats for your head at a low level. <br />
<br />
Flame Deflector on a macro is nice against mages or warlocks.<br />
<br />
Minor Recomboulator is nice to unsheep your friends. Something only a priest I think can do. Sorry I dont play lame healing classes. I am only DPS FTW!<br />
<br />
Discomboulator Rod- Remember to macro this stuff so the min your out of combat you switch to whatever you need or whatevers cooldown timer is up.<br />
<br />
I forget at what level you can rank up from 150 Eng I think it might be 20. Haven't had a low level character for a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember when an enemy is under 50 hp dont waste your time running shot that f**ker in the back. Then move on to your next target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you if you have more questions or problems plz post them.<br />
<br />
