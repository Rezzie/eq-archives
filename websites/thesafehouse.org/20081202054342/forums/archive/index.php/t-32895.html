<br />
1.  Still playing or recently played EQ II<br />
2.  Would like to help in updating the information in this section<br />
3.  Like to figure out lore, puzzles, the ins and out of classes, etc.<br />
<br />
This is purely an idea of my own, I feel that the Safehouse should always be the place people of roguely extraction go to for information in any game that has roguely things.  Once I get a good idea of who has experience where (me for example, I suck at making myself level, but I am a huge exploring nut) we'll break it down into chunks of who posts and compiles what.<br />
<br />
Also if anyone has eqII rogue questions they haven't been able to get answers to pm me and I'll work on finding the answers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guides for Brigand, Assassin, Swashbuckler and Ranger.  Dirge and Troubadour to be added when possible.  If it has stealth it's roguely, even if it does wear paisley tights.<br />
<br />
Poisons: Effects, best usage (I found out you can stack multiple ones of different types recently, surely a known to many but suprising thing), how to get a hold off etc.<br />
<br />
Crafting and the Rogue: Which tradeskills offer the most bang for the buck for the rogue and why, and how to get it leveled effectively.<br />
<br />
Quests and tasks to focus on for the rogue<br />
<br />
Lore and sights of interest to rogues<br />
<br />
Which races are best for which rogue classes</div></div><hr />
