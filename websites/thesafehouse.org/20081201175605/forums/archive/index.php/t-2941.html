It was to prevent PCs from getting killed due to a lucky roll on the DM's part.<br />
<br />
Then, though, we heard about the wonderful concept of fudging dice behind a DM screen, and the rule was abolished. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kataliya</div><div class="date">05-21-02, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never like the &quot;fumble on a 1&quot; idea. Sure I've smacked myself in the back of the head with my own nunchaku a time or two, but I've been training for 10+ years, and it doesn't happen THAT often. I can't believe that an experienced armsman in the workd of D&amp;D (soembody who LIVES by their weapons) has that much of a chance to harm themselves inadvertantly.<br />
<br />
(This rule was not applicable to clumsly level 1s and 2s. hehe)<br />
<br />
My solution: If you roll a 1, instead of an automatic fumble, you get an additional save. Roll a 1 on this second save, you fumble.  Levels 3-4 rolled 1d2 (er, flipped a coin). 5-10 rolled 1d4. And once we came up with this rule, I never ran any games with players above level 10, so figureing out a save for people above 10 never came up. /shrug<br />
<br />
I always wanted to impliment some sort of &quot;catastophic fumble&quot; rule, but players didn't like the idea.<br />
<br />
I dunno if these rules exist in print somewhere already. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">05-21-02, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 is only a fumble in our campaign if a 1 would miss normally.<br />
<br />
And you also have to remember that combat fumbles are under combat conditions. Practicing with nunchaku at home or the dojo isn't the same as fighting someone. You could accidentally bounce your weapon off of his weapon, or his armor, etc.<br />
<br />
My favorite variant rule is the 1-3 always misses, and 18-20 always hits. It adds variety to combat and some risk against opponents that normally wouldn't worry you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_kiyotee</div><div class="date">05-21-02, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think currently rolling a 1 or a 20 isn't an automatic critical hit or fumble. If I recall correctly (pardon me it's been a couple months since I've gamed... pity me) if you roll a 1 you then make another attack roll if that roll would have hit youjust miss, if the second roll would have missed you critically fumble. similar with crit hits. if you roll a 20 you roll again. if that would have hit you crit hit, if not you just hit regularly. __________________________________________________ __________<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">05-21-02, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In 2E I liked when some GMs would let clerics cast any wisdom-bonus spells on the fly. It's not as permissive as getting  all spells on the fly, and it sort of makes sense.<br />
<br />
Although, if a GM ever asks you if you'd like your wizards to cast on the fly too,  just say no !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">05-22-02, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres another variant rule, and rationale:<br />
<br />
One big problem with D&amp;amp;D is stats.  Middling numbers are just not so good and extreme ones.  Strength is the most blatant case of extremes making extreme differences.  An 8 Strength is much the same as a 14.  So, instead of having damage bonuses for high Str, here's an idea: <br />
For each weapon to which the Str damage bionus currently applies, consider the damage done to be in tenths of the wielder's strength instead of straight HP.  A short sword does 10-60% of the wielders str as damage, not 1 to 6 HP.  A str 10 (human normal) wielder would would do the same as before, but a str 14 one would do 1.4 to 8.4 hp, and a str 18 one 1.8 to 10.8 hp.  (round to the nearest hp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arafain</div><div class="date">05-22-02, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite rule has to be the triple threat rule.  Roll a 20 to crit, roll another 20 when confirming, and roll a third time.  If the third roll beats the target's AC - instant kill, no save.  Seen a level 6 monk kill a full health troll with this with one punch....we musta laughed for thirty minutes.<br />
<br />
As to critical fumbles, our DM has an interesting rule.  If you roll a 1 on an attack roll, you make a dex check (d20 + your current reflex save) with a DC of 15.  If you make it, you simply miss that attack.  If you fail your dex check, however, you 'stumble' and lose all your subsequent attacks for that round.  If you roll a 1 on your dex check, you drop your weapon.  He devised this rule to scale critical fumble seriousness with player level - his rationale being that higher-level characters would be more likely to recover from critical fumbles, thus a higher-level character has a better chance to ignore the fumble, thanks to his higher reflex save.<br />

Rerolling 1s on HP rolls sound like a good idea also.  -- Veteran Arafain Entreri, 60 Assassin<br />

<br />
&quot;If you can do it, so can the NPCs and monsters&quot;<br />

Lemme tell ya... The players stopped griping about not being able to just hire a vastly skilled assassin to kill this one annoying NPC and have him just be dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We usually have all caster memorise their spells, but they are givent the option to use the &quot;spell slot&quot; to cast another instead but doubleing the casting time.<br />

The reason we do this is to actually see the utility spell being use from time to time instead of the usuall... I'll take 2 magic missile, 1 sleep, 2 invisibility and fireball. Baron Thanak Kalahed <br />

The reason I mentioned that is we had this one GM who was famous for luring people to their graves by offering to let player wizards do it, but only if npcs could do it to..

The roll either left you with a straight up benefit, or a benefit that reflected a penalty. So one was &quot;+1 to hit/damage rolls with bladed weapons = to a short sword&quot; or &quot; +2 sv vs cold based attacks, -2 vs fire based attacks&quot; or &quot;+5 against fear checks, -5 on npc charisma reactions&quot; things of that nature.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like the background rolls from Arduin. They've got all sorts of +/- bonuses on em, and some other stuff too.<br />
