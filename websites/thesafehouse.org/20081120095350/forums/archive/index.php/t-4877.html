What about the various midlevels?  I'm level 15 now with sword at 13, CS at 13, Stealth auto'd at 3, and envenom at 9.  What route should I concentrate for the mid levels?  Start pumping my CS more to get the better styles sooner, like PA and such?  Or try to keep my sword as close to level as possible?  My plan toward the end game is heavy on envenom, with roughly equal stealth, CS, and sword.  Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">02-12-02, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm only 24, mind you, but I autotrained stealth through that level.  I found that perforate artery (which I got at 23) is a nice thing to have because backstab II is pretty excruciating to use when your stealth is low and you move so slowly.  I recommend getting this at level 21.  I also recommend keeping envenom at 10 (lethal poison) till R v R levels, and instead keep sword nearly maxed to make up for the lower chance your opening CS works.  I would say if I had to keep stealth autotrained until 28, I would give up playing, because it's pretty hard to hold out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Morinn</div><div class="date">02-16-02, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am going auto stealth till 32 and max CS till then. I am gonna stop training max axe skill at 28 and start saving points for stealth when I hit 32 to dump into that as fast as I can.<br />
<br />
With items now at 27th level I have 27 CS and 29 axe skill. I do more than enough damage off gar/ah combos to take down green mobs solo and blues ok to. I never take a chance with yellows unless they are some form of tree mob as an axe rips them up. Right now in partys I have to go one hand axe/shield to keep the mobs off me with any tank 2 levels above me and lower.<br />
<br />
Cause sooner or later you are gonna unload a good garotte and real nice crit with it and the mobs you are fighting will kill you before the healers can save you with a 2 hander. Pluss the SB i see with left axe/weapon combo also generate so much aggro off their hits they are pow spounges as well.<br />
<br />
I am certain this is because I keep my weapon skill above my level and my CS at my level. I am hoping that when 32 rolls around I can get stealth 2/3 and keep Cs max till I work back on my weapon skill later in levels. As it stands now I am gonna go 50 in axe cause I think poisons are not worth the points. If they rework the skill I will look into it 35+ levels.</div></div><hr />
