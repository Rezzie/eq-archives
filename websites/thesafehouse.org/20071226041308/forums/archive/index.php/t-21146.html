<br />
This is the absolute best news I've heard from the R1 industry for a while! FUNimation!<br />
<br />
It's finally neko mimi mode in the USA! Hope they give it a great release like they did Fullmetal Alchemist, now that their video quality issues are pretty much solved, they are one of the best R1 companies for the hardcore market. They are also releasing Kodocha! <br />
<br />
I literally screamed in joy when I read this. Scared the **** outta my cat. Man, this is soooo great! <br />

If our experience with Naruto and One Peice teach us anything, probably not for another year or two.</div></div><hr />

There's a LOT of fights better than Rock Lee's fight in Bleach. If not already, then they are upcoming. Sorry but Kenpachi &gt; Rock Lee any day of the week and thirty three times on Sunday.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of releases, oh my god, the Gankutsuou box is THE VERY OWN~ It's Limited Edition, pick it up while you can! I can not possibly think of a better box than it. It gives Gunslinger Girl a run for it's money!<br />
<br />
Ah, Gunslinger Girl, another amazing Funimation release. That only makes me even wetter thinking of the Tsukuyomi release! I absolutely can not wait. If they include the Hazuki body pillow, I'll cry tears of joy, ha ha in my dreams -.-;<br />
<br />
I almost bought it, it went sold out like two hours before I decieded to buy it :(</div></div><hr />

This means I can find the soundtrack easier if I just wait! Woohoo and I was about to import it, too! Great news!</div></div><hr />

One thing that I am a little worried about is if they mess up the Tsukuyomi openings. It changes every episode, slightly, so I hope they do it properly instead of missing them. But given how they've done their releases lately and how well they've been listening to the market lately, and how much effort they are going to cater to the hardcore market (I mean, c'mon! Kodocha! Hell IS frozen)<br />
<br />
So I hope all goes well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">10-28-05, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heg, would be cool if the actually did each induvidual opening, complete with the trippy 'Tsukuyomi Mode' ones.<br />
 <br />
Either way, I've pretty much given up on finding an mp3 of one of the endings.  Managed to find both 'Neko mimi mode' AND 'Tsuku yomi mode', along with ending #1... but ending #2 'Pressentiment Triste' eludes me &gt;.&lt;<br />
 <br />
Now, it is only a matter of time... MWAHAHAHAhahahahaa</div></div><hr />

They do tend to mess with opens and endings sometimes but heres to hoping they keep it original :P..</div></div><hr />

I also remember seeing a lot of BECK manga ads, so here's to hoping they bring that over too. Granted, I don't think they ever will, due to the nature of there being bilingual and single language characters interacting, and it is impossible to pull off the story in just english...<br />
 <br />
But still, I can hope.</div></div><hr />

They might, just have to maybe accept the fact that you will hear both...<br />

I mean BECK is pretty much as good as yer gonna get out of the box- trying to change any of the dailogue will just kill it.<br />
 <br />
&lt;fume&gt;<br />
 <br />
And there's no way in hell they'd leave the japanese in. I mean, japanese people speaking japanese standing next to american people speaking english!?!? No way! They must butcher the dailogue and force all characters to talk in ways that small children can understand! Hell, they'll prolly change the songs, too. They'll get some garage band from LA to preform 'original' songs that aren't spoken in japanese/engrish.<br />
 <br />
&lt;/fume&gt;</div></div><hr />

Well i mean if its that language oriented then they might have to just leave it like it originally was in japanese and go with it....im sure fans would not mind but others who want it all in english will b*ch....if what ya say is true then they would have to keep it the same other wise it will be all messed up...</div></div><hr />

I'm sure some Akamatsu (Love HIna, AI Love You, etc) fans will be happy to hear it, but can't say I liked the series.<br />
<br />
By the way, Len, most people are under the impression Beck will be licensed soon. Tokyopop had a premature orgasm and published that Beck the manga will be released with the anime, a while ago. It is unlikely they would do that if they did not have it in good authority it was licensed, or in the process of being licensed.<br />
<br />
However, it still has not been officially announced.</div></div><hr />

Love Hina wasn't that bad ppl!!! :P heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the characters were pretty boring and cliche. I know there are a lot of cliche characters in anime, but most of them have something to stand them out in some way. Maybe it's because everyone's the same in Akamatsu works, but I cannot tell the difference between them for the most part.<br />
<br />
It may not be horrible, but it has a hard time staying &quot;average&quot;. Not to say that your mileage doesn't vary, people who like harems will have a different perspective than I do.</div></div><hr />

I know hehe was just trying to be funny :P. Lots of ppl b*ch about the series...<br />
<br />
Im not that big of a fan of harem type anime but i would not say the person in love hina was that weak of a char....ya he was weak most of the times but he did have a strong character that was not easily seen....<br />
<br />
I never saw Akamatsu tho so I dunno about that hehe. But from the sounds of it if they are all the same it would be pretty boring...</div></div><hr />

Akamatsu is the mangaka of Love Hina and Negima.<br />
<br />
I do realize Negima is not fully a harem, but it has enough of the characteristics of it to turn me off. Sure, it has 42 characters, and 40 of them are boring and stereotypical, the other two only appeal to me because of my particular niche (or would the proper word be fetish?)<br />
<br />
Regardless of how they see Negima, they swarm over him like bees and honey. Again, it's not to say it's a bad series, just that it is not my type of series.</div></div><hr />
