<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xumten</div><div class="date">06-07-02, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had made an Infiltrator on Bors awhile back to play with some RL friends. Then 10 lvls later they wanted to come to Midgard and play over there with me. Now we are shifting back over to Albion.<br />
<br />
So once again, Im playing my Infiltrator. Now my RL friends have never played an assassins before and they are pretty eager to get to 24 and play in the BG sandbox. I gave them a NATURAL template of:<br />
<br />
21 CS<br />
20 Stealth<br />
17 Thrust<br />
15 Envenom<br />
4 DW<br />
<br />
This seems like a pretty solid template to me. With some low level items we can take Stealth to 23-25. We will have PA and a respectable envenom.<br />
<br />
But then I thought why have 3 of us all the same. So I thought about mixing it up for me a bit and going:<br />
<br />
24 Envenom<br />
20 Stealth<br />
17 Thrust<br />
10 CS<br />
4 DW <br />
<br />
My question is there a low level item any where that gives +1 Envenom? I'd really like to have 25 in Envenom for the next DOT poison. This may very well be a gimp, but I figured why not play around... have more than enough room to grow.  Edited by: Xumten at: 6/7/02 8:32:12 am</div></div><hr />

Correct me if im wrong plz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 13 env with modifiers and cannot use a level 15 poison. Why people say you can is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
With my level 45 Infiltrator with a base of 38 envenom, plus the DF jewel (+5) and realm rank 3 (+2) I can use the level 45 poison. I do it all the time, it works...nuff said.</div></div><hr />

You cannot autotrain stealth to 20.  The MOST you can get from autotrain is 12.  Autotrain ONLY keeps a skill at 1/4 of you level.  You really want to leave stealth uuntrained until 48 for those &quot;free&quot; points?  <br />
<br />
Let it autotrain once, MAYBE twice, but much more than that and you might as well forget the BGs even exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe so, but I was told on the vault boards that you still have to be level 45 (the class level not spec level) before you can use that level 45 poison.<br />
<br />
My example of being level 13 trying to use a level 15 poison is what I was referring to in this case; I can't use the level 15 poison until my actual character class reaches level 15. I could have an envenom of 200, but until I ding to 15 it doesn't matter. That's also why the poisons con grey,green,blue, yellow etc.. 'cause they con against your level.<br />
<br />
Ah so many conflicting opinions. Edited by: Gunshotwound at: 7/29/02 3:13:39 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am interested, however, in hearing what everyone else says. Perception is reality...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jammermon</div><div class="date">08-01-02, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">he meant auto-train to LEVEL 20 (skill 5) <br />
<br />
I suggest L24 (Skill 6) then hit BG1 as a big bad boy. Dont use any train points 23 tho, hold em for that last free autotrain then bang all 23 and 24 into stealth and then go racxk em stack em toe tag em<br />
<br />
This will NOT work PvP.<br />
<br />
You need fair stealth as early as L11<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xumten</div><div class="date">08-04-02, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since it got bumped, and co-incidently I have actually been playing him recently(Xumten is a man of MANY alts) I thought I would update.<br />
<br />
I auto-trained stealth till I hit lvl 24. I'll list the gear I had come across(all yellow/ok to me) next time I log him on and I'll jot it down. Might help others. The gear gave me some nice bonuses... Stealth is at 24(20+4), CS at 22(21+1), Thrust 22(17 +5), Envenom at 15, and DW 1. Or something close to that.<br />
<br />
The template is definately solid and works really well out there. <br />
<br />
Anyways if anyone is in Alb/Bors, Cease is my name there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">08-04-02, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use a poison higher than your level, but there is a limit to how far above you can go.  I'm not sure what that limit is though.<br />
<br />
I know my friend who recently started an infiltrator was using the level 15 lethal poison when he was level 13.  I also know an infiltrator in my guild who has been using lifebane since around level 45 or 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jammermon</div><div class="date">08-07-02, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Limit is no bonus on any skills can ever exceed Level/5.<br />
<br />
So a L24 lucky enough to get +6 Envenom items will get only +4 out of them and only be able to use poisons up to Train +4. <br />
<br />
When he hits L25 he will then get +5 out of his +6 Env items. <br />

<br />
Infiltrator lvl 43<br />
Envenom skill 39<br />
Item and rank bonus +6 <br />
<br />
Able to use lvl 45 lethal poisons effectively.  <br />
<br />
I should have stopped envenom at 39 but what is done is done.  <br />
