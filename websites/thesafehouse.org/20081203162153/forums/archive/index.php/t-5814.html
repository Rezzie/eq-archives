Anyone recall seeing this, or care to speculate whats going on.  Especially with the upcomming patch?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I belive it was &quot;levying penalties on followers of the Evil paths&quot;<br />
<br />
I shudder to think what that will end up being.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen figures (with no source atached) that have claimed Evil to be 60% of the playerbase on sullon and good to be as low as 10%.<br />
<br />
Speculation is that The Nameless diety will change its alliance, thereby taking it's followers from the evil team to another team. Edited by: MajestykVZ at: 7/5/01 1:55:46 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt that it would make much difference if The Nameless switched teams, since no players follow him. (He was invented long after EQ was released and anyone with the ability to make changes to the EQ engine mysteriously vanished.)</div></div><hr />

  &quot;I feel that implementing a staffing change will facilitate a stronger sense of corporate spirit here in our company. If you'll take a look at the new organizational chart that I've attached to the front of our latest quarterly progress update, you'll see that we'll be shifting a few key members to different teams. Rallos, you'll be leaving the systems administration division to assume the position of team leader for the customer service team, where you'll be working with Veeshan on our new &quot;Hey, Mortals Are People Too!&quot; program. Bristlebane and Brell will now be reporting to Tunare in the technical support section. Here are your headsets and aspirin. Now, moving on...I've drawn up a Project timeline with a listing of deadlines and expected milestone dates with a full task-resource breakdown on page 88, right before the new NGR-36-2903 Smiting Request Form.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Innoruuk says, &quot;I could use a few NGR-36-2903 Smiting Request Forms...I've got some action items for Nektulos that have been on the back burner for a while now that really need to get some closure.  The possibilities for a hostile takover from the Lanys group are getting more and more distressing, and we need to start thinking about our clientele.  If the @#%$ of Hate falls...where does that leave the Stockholders?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brell says, &quot;You should have thought of that before you opened up that complaints department that lets mortals into your home offices.  Now you're dead six days a week...no wonder your workload is piling up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Innoruuk says, &quot;Hey, at least it's only six days instead of seven - good thing I picked crap loot to carry around, unlike SOMEBODY else here...&quot;<br />
