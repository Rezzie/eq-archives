<br />
Only played it once, at a convention, but it was a complete blast when I had slept less than 4 hours the last 2 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Faerie Meat is pretty flippin cool too.  Kenzer &amp;amp; Company rocks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Hackmaster is neat. Better than 3rd edition imho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">02-18-02, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HackMaster is very much the  flavour of D&amp;amp;D I played the first half of my RPG career, so it's almost like I have the rules memorized already. I'm enjoying D&amp;amp;D 3rd and everything d20 so thoroughly that I may never be back. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Narsham</div><div class="date">02-20-02, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How can you not love a game where you can (under the strict rules) create a Pixie Fairy thief who can fly, turn invisible while flying for 1 round/level each day, move silently while flying, and have - <br />
95% pick pockets, <br />
90% Hide in shadows<br />
85% Move silently<br />
60% open locks<br />
40% Find traps<br />
40% remove traps<br />
and a 25 dexterity<br />
<br />
At first level... And then throw him at your players, to relieve them of their valuables? Not to mention that IF they manage to kill him, he comes back in 1d4 months.. when they forget about him.<br />
<br />
Of course, if they don't jack up their characters as much as this guy, then they won't see him as often. He tends to go after the toughest/more famous people. But any 25-strength 25-constitution half ogres are going to attract this guy like Teflon Billy's fireballs attract 'collateral damage.'</div></div><hr />
