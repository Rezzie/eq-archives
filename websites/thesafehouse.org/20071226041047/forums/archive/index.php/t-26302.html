<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">10-07-06, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's extremely mediocre.<br />
<br />
Made to seem better by the fact that it's immidiatly followed by the kickass Bleach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">10-07-06, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've read about the novel/manga, it seems a lot of the story was stripped away for the anime.<br />
<br />
From the Wikipedia entry it seems nearly half the characters from the manga don't even appear in the anime.  So I'm not sure how fully developed the anime characters can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">10-07-06, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was worth watching when I did watch. So yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnolSournote</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you want to watch something that is alot like Hellsing, here you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In that they both have vampires in them?<br />
<br />
Hellsing has about 10x as much style than this show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of doing this poll, get 1st 5 eps and watch them and decide for yourself. It's the best way IMO, tastes differ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnolSournote</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not just that they both have vampires but the vampire hero is being controlled by a woman who he has been protecting since a child.  And that he has to unlock his various levels of power in order to fight.  All they have to do is give Sister Ester a really big gun that she doesn't want to use.</div></div><hr />

That's why I put up the poll, to keep from possibly wasting $20. :)<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, I'll get to see for myself soon.  In Best Buy today I stumbled across a free sampler disc from FUNimation that includes a single, full episode of Trinity Blood, as well as Basilisk, Speed Grapher, and Desert...something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-08-06, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't base the series off the first episode. I somewhat enjoyed the first two or three episodes, but it all came crashing down after that.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: However, I highly recommend Basilisk ~Kouga Ninpou Chou~, it is a great ninja flick.</div></div><hr />

oh buying, completely different. I watched it a while ago fansubbed. As if this is worth 20 dollars, probably not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'Look im a bumbling fool slipping on blood&quot; -Squints eyes and breaks something important on purpose-  &quot;Sorry, I slipped&quot;<br />
<br />
According to Newtype it gets better later,  Im reserving judgement.  But Im probably not going to pick it up even though i liked the other two series.  Mixing them together seems kind of odd so far.</div></div><hr />
