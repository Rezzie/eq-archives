<br />
     Ancient Legacy will be a community where we encourage leaders and members of vision, values, pride, loyalty and dedication. Our vision is to accomplish everything the game has to offer...to keep the pace along the progression of the game as it moves forward. We will do whatever it takes to succeed in every event we plan. We will embrace our friendships and fun, our history and our future while at the same time making sure we achieve excellence in everything we do at all times.<br />

<br />
I come here today to give you the latest developments on Ancient Legacy.<br />
<br />
We are still accepting applications for every class, and would love to have you all come and give us a look.<br />
<br />
We have undergone some recent changes in the guild leadership, with me stepping up as leader in the place of Kanos, our recently departed guildleader due to some RL issues.<br />
<br />
I have many plans for this guild, and hope that you can be there with us to see them implemented.<br />
<br />
Our website is -- www.ancient-legacy.com -- feel free to come and browse the site.<br />
<br />
We are currently in the process of adding a FAQ's page to our frontpage for newcomers to get a basic idea of what we are about. We have an excellent set of forums set up and would love for you to come and hang out with us.<br />
<br />
Forums can be accessed via the main page.<br />
