I saw a short description in the Manual of the Planes but otherwise not much. If there isn't one, I'll have to make it myself hehe =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-28-02, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about this, but there were some 2nd Ad(I think) books that were specific to things like Vikings, Celtics, ect.... May they have possibly put one out for Faeries, or maybe it is in one of the compendiums?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Silvermouse</div><div class="date">06-28-02, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! I'll check it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-28-02, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got to thinking about the Faerie Folk.....<br />
<br />
I don't know whether you are needing setting, game mechanics, or both, but I have a wonderful resource you could use to start with.<br />
<br />
Read Faerie Tale by Raymond E. Feist. It's chaulk full of old faerie lore, and delves into Faerie glamour, habits, and even gives them their own world. It could be very helpful if you don't know what to build up from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Silvermouse</div><div class="date">06-28-02, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a book called &quot;Faeries and Elves&quot; by Time/Life books series &quot;The Enchanted World&quot;. If any of you haven't read that series it is a must read. The books are absolutely gorgeous and pretty cheap on Ebay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Stardust by Neil Gaiman<br />
Anything by Charles de Lint<br />
 Changeling: The Dreaming by White Wolf<br />
<br />
There are scads of others, obviously, but those come immediately to mind. Kehvrynne Quickblade, Professional Damsel of Distress<br />
