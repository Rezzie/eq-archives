My premise is that verant removed about 200 ac under the covers from the listed total ac.  A monk with 1500 ac would have an effective 1300 ac after the patch but it would still be above the soft cap or around 1200ish.  Ahh you see where I am going.  The only thing that makes sense is that the ac softcap is going to be raised substatially in PoP.  Thus no monk with ac equal to a plate class can compete because they will effectively have 200 ac lower.  The monks with lower ac noticed it alot right now.  The monks with higher ac wont notice it until PoP.  <br />

There are now 812,721 threads from monks complaining, coulda just joined one of those.<br />
<br />
Im personally very very very tired of it. <br />
<br />
As for this thread, VI gave you your answers, there was nothing secret about it.  Monks with 6500hp and the ability to defend better than warriors aint gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

That being said I don't find it unreasonable for someone to seek opinions from players of a different class. If you just want to flame monks, take it elsewhere.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen the nerf hit hard, it just missed the target. The monks geared up in the high end game are mostly saying it's business as usual, while the less well equipped are taking a big hit over it all.<br />
The one's accused of tanking like warriors had their gear to blame from the start, so in effect it did nothing to balance the issues. However,since the twinks and elite escaped relatively unscathed, they will be sure to quiet things down to prevent a better aimed nerf from striking in the near future.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AsturiasAurora</div><div class="date">10-28-02, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a 55 Monk as my main, and I don't see a problem with the 'nerf' as everyone calls it.  Yes, I do take a bit more noticeable damage, especially when forced to tank mobs in places like Plane of Growth while the necro recasts Fear.  But the way I see it, it's common sense (plate mail takes more hits than chest straps...period.), and forces the Monks that aren't 'uber' equipped to resort to using their Stonestance disc more than their Innerflame or Thunderous Kick, or to just stand back and let the proper tank types get aggro again.  Works just like evade....ya get your ass handed to ya, FD, then stand back up again.  Ya, it hurts a bit, but thanks to this 'nerf', I'm only 1 point away from the 210 bind wound cap  <br />
<br />
And before any of you bitch about why a person is griping about monks in the 'other classes' section of a rogue message board, try playing one sometime...I wouldn't be at all surprised to see you writing in this section of the boards either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Wing Terrian</div><div class="date">10-30-02, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I think as far as seeing &quot;monks coming here and whining&quot; might go hand in hand, with many other classes going to Monkly-business, and gloating there.<br />
<br />
What happens sucks. It may have been needed, it may not have been. But rubbing someone's nose in it, just isn't right. Being civil towards each other, is the right thing to do. Gloating, posting insults, then running off, is not.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm hoping this whole thing just gets dropped soon, and fades from being the bandwagon of the week.<br />
