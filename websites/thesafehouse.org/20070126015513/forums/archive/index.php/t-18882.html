<br />
first i ambushed then basicaly meleed till he through up his shield... while he healed i ate to gain back health... knowing how long the sheid is i stealthed cause he took himself out of combat... ambushed again... now cause of the mind numbin he started to cast his heal spell but it taking longer i was able to get the gouge off to vanish and ambush yet another time... the pally freaked and started to run... but crip poison kept him slow for the kill...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ambush gets a real kick where it counts after 40 when all the real tanks are wearing plate though. Good job :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiphus</div><div class="date">07-19-06, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this is what I normally do: Stunlock. Normally, if a paladin is stucked in a stun throughout the entire battle, he can't even hope to Bubble heal. <br />
<br />
But of course, stunlocking is not foolproof. In case stunlocking ****** up, remember this: A paladin with no mana is a dead paladin. Thus, I keep forcing them to heal and heal and heal. However, this is risky, obviously. There is a rather high chance that you will die first, though there was once I survived long enough to see him without mana, and that pretty much meant game over for the paladin.<br />
<br />
And one thing to note, when the paladin bubbles, this is what you should do, stay back and first aid. The paladin can't come to you, and with you first aiding, you are resetting the fight and once again, you have a higher chance of surviving that encounter.<br />
<br />
Then there is the most dishonorable method for us rogues to use, something we are amazingly good at: Ganking. Wait till the paladin's health is very low, though you are going to have to wait a long time, and you have to be quick or else he 'Lays on Hands'. A critical ambush will finish the job.<br />
<br />
And finally, don't **** up on your stunlock or the battle will be hell.<br />
<br />
And remember, always use Crippling Poison.</div></div><hr />
