<br />
I heard uber haste was a waste on beastlords cause they dont get double attack, is this true??  I also heard it was a waste of time to not use a h2h weapon, cause thats whats gonna carry u 50-60, is this true????<br />
<br />
I was thinking id get a belt of the great turtle, SCHW, BBU or fist or iron,  and then just get good solid armor pieces like treeweave, and acrylia for the rest of the slots.  <br />
<br />
Any advice???<br />

Back in the old days if anyone even hinted about twinking on this board they were flamed.<br />
<br />
Now days you only get a Bic pointed in your direction.<br />

I guess I'm one of the rare ones. I'm a 60 without a twink. I do have a couple Alts around. A lvl 5 DE with high Cha for buying Hate stones. A lvl 19 HE War from when I retired Rune before evade was put into the game, equipped in some midlevel gear from about 3 years ago.<br />
<br />
Twink? Nope. 44.5K? Hell, most I've ever had was about 12K. That's because I'm a soft touch for folks NOT begging but in need. If I have something they need and am not useing it they can have it.<br />

With that said, a beastlord forum would probably get you better answers than you can find here.<br />
EQ Beastlords is a good site.  <br />

Actually, when he said bst couldn't use a fungi, he only said fungi (not specifically mentioning tunic), of which there are two, and he was reffering to bst in general which would entail 51+.<br />
<br />
So I guess I can read eh?</div></div><hr />

I thought the crowd was actually on the tame side for this one. <br />
<br />
Btw, yes many people twink the difference is most generally don't do something like post on Monkly Business asking where to spend their mad twinking cash on their new Wizard. <br />
<br />
&amp;lt;does the shrug thing&gt;<br />
<br />
No biggie, just don't be too suprised or indignant that 70% of the responses are on the negative side. Edited by: HarloweRogue at: 8/30/02 1:39:14 am</div></div><hr />

Ive played rogue since 99 and been a member of this board since 2000, just wanted to ask a few rogues/beastlords who frequent this forum and are long time friends, some advice, didn't want to get flamed by people i dont know for reasons that are rather obvious to me, and unimportant in the scheme of things, and EQ ingeneral...<br />
<br />
HOWEVER...I'd also like to apologize for my behavior, it was insecure and defensive of me, i was very aggrivated that day, no hard feelings... But what many of you(not all of you) said/did was just immature and unnecessary, id appreciate it, if u guys would at least think about what im saying<br />
<br />
Anyways further input would be great ;p<br />
<br />
Thanks for those of you who have given me some, and for putting this post in an appropraite(new??) section of the forum<br />

<br />
As far as Armor goes, Phase Spider Carpace is probably the best chest armore your going to find at the bazaar, they normally go for anywhere from 15-17k on the server I play one, Sleeves or greyflesh sleevs are good. I'm not very sure on much else armor wise as I haven't looked into armor that much( might want to check EQ Beastlord as mentioned before ) generally you want AC/sta/str/was stuff, just browse the bazaar and see what you can find.<br />
<br />
As far as weapons go, first of rock( aroudn 4k on my server ) Zehkas Katar( not sure on the spelling, ranges from 15k-35k ) and Blackbladed Ulak are all very nice high end weapons.<br />
<br />
Also you can just ask on eqbeastlord too.</div></div><hr />

I don't care about the post, it's in the non-rogue forum, so the subject matter doesn't bother me in the least...I just take exception to false generalizations.<br />
<br />
I am generally bored with being level 60, so I mostly play a level 35 Cleric, a level 29 Monk and a level 24 Necro.  None of them are twinked, none of them get powerleveled (if I am bored being 60, why would I be in a rush to get there again?). Kuurus<br />
