Tying for second place is the many times I have to inform a younger rogue of this truth.<br />
<br />
To be honest I think that we should be able to, and I hear that during beta those who wanted to play PvP (by turning in their pvp books) could in fact pp others, but they screwed us over for some reason.<br />
