Pretty sure we all got food poisoning too, but we fed 6 people on like 10 bucks, gave a pretty fat tip if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a similar (but not nearly as gory) note, I was eating at a restaurant in Des Moines a couple years ago, and found chunks of GLASS in my salad.  Apparently someone had broken some bowls and thought they had cleaned up all the glass... same type of deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Boot Disk</div><div class="date">03-07-04, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once I got a bite of a slug in a salad, thinking it was a mushroom. It squirmed in my mouth and I yelped out but in doing so I accidentally swallowed it. It left that sticky-stuff that slugs leave in my mouth for so long. I couldn't wash it out. where anger is big and fueled by hydrogen</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kinare</div><div class="date">03-07-04, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was at Outback and ordered a Wallaby Darned (it's basically an orange frozen alcohol drink). I was drinking it through a *****, happily crunching on the ice, when some of the ice seemed rather substantial. I worked it out of my mouth and picked it off my tongue. It was shards of glass. Really small shards of glass. <br />
<br />
I called the waitress, and they replaced my drink (I didn't get it for free, the drink was just replaced). We also got a $20 gift certificate, but it wasn't usable on that visit.<br />
<br />
Now I know better. Next time, I will refuse any attempt to placate my anger and call the health department. I can guarentee they will lose more than $20 in business.</div></div><hr />
