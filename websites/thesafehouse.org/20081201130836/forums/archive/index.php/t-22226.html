<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">01-03-06, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Six new screenshots have gone up on Vanguard's Screenshots Gallery (http://www.vanguardsagaofheroes.com/screenshots.php).  There's a gnoll fight, an undead fight, an ogre battle, and a couple pics of mounts.<br />
<br />
One thing I'd like to draw attention to that others may miss is that I appreciate the attention to detail that's going into Vanguard's sky.  The stars hiding behind wispy clouds, and the nice use of colours (not just a standard blue sky).  Here (http://www.vanguardsagaofheroes.com/screenshots/01-03-06_horse_1024.jpg), here (http://www.vanguardsagaofheroes.com/screenshots/11-14-05_orc_1024.jpg) , and here (http://www.vanguardsagaofheroes.com/screenshots/11-14-05_qaliatower_1024.jpg) (absolutely love the sky in this last pic) are a few examples of what I mean.<br />
<br />
The terrain looks impressive, but just as the landscape has its trees and grass and sand, the skyscape has its blending of colours fading into the horizon, varying styles of clouds, and a backdrop of stars shining through at night.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">01-05-06, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the sky, its got depth to it, not just a flat wash of one or even two layers. My favorite of the pics you pointed out Ruccus is the last one with the great armor and cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chromite</div><div class="date">01-05-06, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the best thing is the skeletons.  My god they look awesome.  I love the armor and robes that are in tatters.  You can see through them and stuff.  Most realistic/best looking skeletons I've seen in an MMORPG yet.  Course I haven't seen them in motion or close up yet so I can't say that for sure :)<br />
<br />
One thing's for sure, Sigil has mastered the art of brownness.  Those logs look pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">01-05-06, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree Chromite. And I'm really anxious to see more of Telon's undead. They play a central role in Telon's backstory so I imagine there are going to be many &quot;flavors.&quot; Zombies should be utterly disgusting. :zombie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerda Jurtafryde</div><div class="date">01-05-06, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love that armor with lion's heads on it.  Looks great.<br />
<br />
Those old Qalia screenshots look so beautiful I may have to make a Qalian barbarian instead of a Thestran one.</div></div><hr />

Well i agree but the only 2 images of Zombies i have saw were a little .. well  they look good, but not quite the rotting corpse i was hoping for.:zombie <br />

I'm guessing you didn't play a human, erudite or barbarian in EQ? ;)</div></div><hr />
