A couple of things rogues do is research, have patience and pick pockets! Now we all know that rogues on Vanguard can't PvP as well as other classes, and that Whoosh :frown sound gives us away everytime, however! We still like playing the class! So heres a good quest to get some good capes for your guild and especiallyYOU! ENJOY!:pimp <br />

multi-layered quest to investigate the Infineum Mining Camp. <br />
<br />
[edit]Quest Text<br />
Scholar Donovan tells you, &quot;Untill we know why the miners are collecting the Infineum, we can't discredit the possibility that they could be a threat to Ahgram. I implore you to travel to their outpost south of here and discover their motives behind mining the Infineum.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please report back to me when you are finished.&quot; <br />
<br />
[edit]Clue<br />
This is a multi-layered quest. You will need to discover other quests within the Infineum Mines before you can complete this one. <br />
<br />
[edit]Detailed Information (Spoilers)<br />
Head south from Donovan's Roost to the Infineum Mines. The mobs are three and four dots in the lower twenties. From the entrance, veer to your left toward a ramp leading up to a platform with some buildings. Hang around this ramp until Warden Pondar (a mob with a white name) paths along it. Hail Pondar to be given a quest. You must do the following quests in order to complete Strange Things Are Afoot. <br />
<br />
Avoiding the Whip <br />
Help the Runaway <br />
Collect Samples of Ore for Donovan <br />
Once you have completed these three quests, you can return to Donovan. <br />
<br />
[edit]Concluding Dialogue<br />
Scholar Donovan asks you, &quot;I can't say that I am surprised that they attacked you. They've been hostile to people in the past. The fact that they have Aghram citizens as slaves is also troubling.&quot; <br />
<br />
Scholar Donovan concentrates on the ore momentarily. A few seconds later, he shivers and tells you, &quot;It is as I feared.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I must ponder this revelation. In the meantime, choose one of these items and go with my thanks. Return to me when you are ready to deal with the implications of your discovery.&quot; <br />
<br />
[edit]Rewards<br />
Choice of: <br />
<br />
Infineum Cloak of Agression <br />
Infineum Cloak of Deterrence <br />
Infineum Cloak of Empathy <br />
Infineum Cloak of Destruction <br />
Infineum Cloak of Defence <br />
[edit]Stages of Quest<br />
<br />
2nd PART:<br />
<br />
One of the required quests to complete Strange Things Are Afoot. You must have that quest in your log to obtain this quest. To obtain the quest you must locate Warden Pondar, who roams the Infineum Mining Camp and hail him. The best location to find him is the ramp to the left of the camp entrance. <br />
<br />
[edit]Quest Text<br />
Unfortunately, the mining guard that you met near the Northern Infineum Mines did not reveal any evidence of the miner's intentions. He also warned you that the mines are strictly regulated, and that the guards would attack intruders. <br />
<br />
The warden also mentioned a &quot;Slave Driver's whip,&quot; so perhaps a slave would be more willing to divulge information regarding the mining outfit. <br />
<br />
[edit]Objectives<br />
Find a slave willing to speak about the mining. <br />
Warden Pondar mentioned a &quot;slave Driver's whip&quot; so perhaps a slave would be more willing to divulge information regarding the mining outfit. Find a slave from the Infineum Mining Camp that will speak to you about the local mining activities. <br />
<br />
[edit]Clue<br />
The slave is hiding somewhere in the green vertical pillars in the camp. <br />
<br />
[edit]Detailed Information (Spoilers)<br />
The slave is hiding in the fence to the left on your way out (back north). Hail him to conclude the quest. <br />
<br />
<br />
3rd PART:<br />
One of the required quests to complete Strange Things Are Afoot. You must have completed Avoiding the Whip to obtain this quest. <br />
<br />
[edit]Quest Text<br />
Xackaria tells you, &quot;Name, as I explained, I require a key to remove this girdle from my waist. Until I have that key, I will say nothing further. Find the Slave Master at the Infineum Mining Camp and retrieve the key. <br />
<br />
[edit]Objectives<br />
Key to Xacharia's Girdle. <br />
The runaway slave, Xackaria, requires a key to remove the girdle from his waist; should he leave the Infineum area, the girdle will Detonate. Travel to the Infineum MIning Camp and retrieve the key from the Slave Master. Return to Xacharia with it. <br />
<br />
[edit]Clue<br />
This is a multi-layered quest obtained as part of Strange Things Are Afoot. You will need to obtain that quest before you can obtain this one. <br />
<br />
[edit]Detailed Information (Spoilers)<br />
You must kill Captain Fubared in the tent at the back of the camp and take the key from him. <br />
<br />
[edit]Concluding Dialogue<br />
Xackaria tells you, &quot;Oh, thank you so much! I doubt that there is much that I could do to convey how happy I am!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As for the mining camp, I will admit that I know very little and that I feigned knowledge to convince you to help me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The camps are run by the members of the cult that reside in the plateau above. I was not privy to the reason behind the mining of these crystals, although I do know that they intend to use them for some unknown ritual.&quot; <br />
<br />
[edit]Strategy for Fubared<br />
Fubared is in a tent at the far end of camp. You must talk to him to make him aggro. <br />
<br />
- Go behind tent. <br />
<br />
- Clear tent <br />
<br />
- Have tank talk to Fubared (must be on quest) <br />
<br />
- Pull to back entryway of tent. If you try to pull him all the way out of the tent, he resets. Have tank position himself between Fubared and tent in entryway. <br />
<br />
- Tank melees Fubared. _Only_ the tank. <br />
<br />
- At 75%, two adds will come. Everyone else kills the adds, tank continues with Fubared. <br />
<br />
- Tank continues to melee Fubared. <br />
<br />
- At 50% two adds will come. Repeat as above. <br />
<br />
- Now everyone can hit Fubared. Two adds will come at 25% percent, but kill Fubared first and then the adds. <br />
<br />
This is one of the buggiest and most painful quests it's ever been my displeasure to endure. Fubared likes to reset mid-battle, meaning you have to do him and all his adds again. If you die, the adds hang around waiting for you to come back so they can kill you when you try and get your corpses. If you come here when someone has bugged the adds by pulling across the ditch, the adds will kill you. They zoom around killing everyone in the vicinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobbwin</div><div class="date">03-06-07, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget to mention that the way the adds spawn is the intended method.  However, in actuality, two spawn right off the bat, with two more right behind them.  In over 6 attempts prior to the last patch, we didn't even have him down 20% before having 4+ adds on us.  <br />
<br />
Also, two of the adds are healers who heal him and two others (channelers IIRC) have an AOE stun that they like to spam during combat.  Have fun with that.  :angry</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats Captain Fubared to you. . . <br />
<br />
The best thing to do is just Zerg him. . .3 groups if you are 22 and less.<br />
<br />
2 and a half if you are 23 and up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">03-13-07, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG fun event. First one I experienced like this in Vanguard. I helped three or four groups finish this over the weekend. Captain Fubared is an understatement. :lol<br />
 <br />
Most efficient strat I found... kill all summoned adds first. Leave the Captain for last, his possee deals more damage than he does. He's a frequent repop, so if you fail you can regather and try again pretty easily while keeping the tent cleared.<br />
 <br />
Identical strat for the next ring quest too (can't remember the name of the NPC). Whack all his skellies before taking him on.</div></div><hr />
