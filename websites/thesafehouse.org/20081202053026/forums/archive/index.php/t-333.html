<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Brisco</div><div class="date">04-21-00, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first attemtp at an EQ type story, so go easy.  <br />
<br />
Brisco, since he had been taken in by the Scouts of Tunare in Kelethin, had always been the oddball of the group. It began with his stubborn devotion to lord Bristlebane, rather than the favored patron of the Scouts, Tunare. He believed he was embodyment of the great Bristlebane's presence on Norrath, and had a tendancy to make that annoyingly clear. While the other scouts worked hard to hone their skills, Brisco ran throughout Greater Faydark acting on impulse, which more often than not, led to a rapid retreat to the elevated town he called home. <br />
<br />
When the time came to move outside of Kelethin's shadow, the trainee scouts began to work against a neighboring orc encampment outside of the retched Clan Crushbone. Brisco found the word to be mere drudgery and grew impatient with his studies. It was then that he decided to travel on, away from the relative safety of the Greater Fay. This is where his story story truly begins...<br />
<br />
The morning was cool and misty as Brisco and his best friend Brennus travelled through the dark wood that is Lower Faydark.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know where we're going right?&quot; Brisco asked, doubting Brennus's skills in negotiating through the thick forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it. We can get off the path just ahead. Trust me.&quot; Brennus replied, casually ignoring Brisco's lack of faith in him.<br />
<br />
They continued up the path until it took a jagged right turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;We go left here&quot; Brennus said, disappearing into the underbrush.<br />
<br />
Brisco followed, picking up his pace a bit. The were headed to a bandit camp containing the infamous Nybright sisters. A third partner, a wood elf named Marmar, was to meet them just outside the camp. <br />
<br />
When the two came upon the camp however, they heard sounds of battle and a familiar voice call out for help. Before them was Marmar, barely fending off the three sisters who were attacking her relentlessly. To the side, a dwarf stood praying to Tunare to heal the doomed woman. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, we have to help her!&quot; Brennus charged ahead, calling to the wilderness to create a burning flame around Jayna Nybright. the sister Marmar was directly fighting. Somehow, through sheer luck, the flames felled the bandit sister, leaving the other two to fight with even more anger than before. Brennus was soon into combat as well, striking Kayla Nybright across the shoulder with his mace.<br />
<br />
Brisco held back another second. It soon looked like Kayla would fall and that would leave Tayla for the three to easily take down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why then, would I bother attacking until the others had already drawn Tayla's attention?&quot; Brisco pondered to himself, loosing track of the battle unfolding before him. &quot;Brennus should be able to handle this one, I can sit back and enjoy the ride...&quot; Then a glint caught the corner of his eye. Around Jayla's burned neck, was a beautiful necklace, ripe for the picking! Brisco was on top of the loot in a flash. <br />
<br />
He reached around behind Jayle to unclasp the necklace making it his to sell back in Kelethin. As he funbled with the hook however, he noticed, to his surprise, that Jayla still had a pulse! Inspecting further, he noticed light, controlled breathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the-&quot; he began to say aloud, interupted, however, by a swift agile kick to the jaw and Jayla rose dextrously. Brisco staggered back in shock, she was still alive after Brennus' spell! Impossible!<br />
<br />
&quot;How dare ye attack the Nybright sisters! I have no will to kill you, but am now forced to!&quot; Jayla shouted as she lunged at Brisco, dagger leading. Brisco reacted quickly and jumped out of the way of what would have been a fatally placed strike. He quickly unsheather his makeshift snake fang piercer and retorted with a swift, clumsy strike that missed Jayla altogether. He knew he was in trouble now, and looked to Brennus and Marmar for help. They were nowhere in sight. Only the bleeding corpse of Kayla Nybright emained where their battle had been fought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brennus! Where are you!?&quot; Brisco shouted in desparation. No response. Somewhere in the Fay woods, Brennus and Marmar were either running, hiding or lying dead at the hands of Tayla Nybright. Brisco didn't like any of those options as they didn't bode well for him at all. Brisco felt Jayla's dagger pierce into his shoulder, knocking him to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jayla... wait... lets work this out!&quot; he sputtered in both pain and dismay. Jayla was ina frenzy though, she would not listen to reason. Brisco thought quick, his single greatest skill. THE DWARF! If nothing else, he could give him Tunare's blessing. He looked frantically for the priest, finally catching site of him in the distance battling a giant spider. <br />
<br />
&quot;Help me please!&quot; Brisco called to him as he returned to his feet in defense.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got problems of my own buddy, no time!&quot; the dawrf yelled back. No help there. Brisco thought more as he layed into Jayla with a few decent stabs, though not having too much of an effect on her. He realized what he had to do if he were to survive this ordeal. He had to take shelter in the dreaded Castle Mistmoore. Praying to Bristlebane he took flight towards the evil land. Jayla was close on his heels as he appoached the gates. Quickly he sunk into the shadows hoping to loose Jayla. Feeling safe from her, he knew he was in probably more danger from the new surrounding. Jayla paced an area not ten meters away from his hiding spot. He was still trapped!<br />
<br />
The End for now.... <br />

Heh, I loved that show... though it got really wierd near the end. Vasilli Obscuri, Master of Shadows&quot;Behind every great warrior is a rogue.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, Brisco County was a wicked cool show. I just met Bruce Campbell last Sunday actually, personally, it was so cool.   He is hilarius.<br />
<br />
Now the real question, is when I hit level 20, do I dare make my last name County Jr...?<br />
<br />
Still got a few levels to decide though<br />

Brisco County Jr. was a great show, though you are right in saying it was strange near the end.  Bruce Campbell is great .... I loved him in Xena and Hercules as he played a master thief .... and now he has his own show called &quot;Jack of all trades&quot; anyone seen it yet?  you should take the surname as Bruce Campbell's characters have the qualities of us rogues!  Hope to see you post more.</div></div><hr />
