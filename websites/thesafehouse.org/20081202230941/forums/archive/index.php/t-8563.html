<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Diotrum</div><div class="date">06-02-03, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had two people confirm now that a light blue con (to 65) mob named &quot;Veeshan&quot; is spawning in VP and stays up for about 25-30min.  It is spawning after the death of the last dragon (maybe, could be random). I'll be heading there next repop to confirm.  It popped on track, but not in view.  Despawned before anyone got to it.<br />
<br />
Anyone else seen this?  I've only heard of it since the repatch, guess there's a chance I just hadn't heard of it before.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Diotrum</div><div class="date">06-03-03, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This in on a live server.  A good tracker wasn't the question really either.  After the last named dropped the mob popped someplace in zone, not in the camp or anything.  I was hoping for a trigger mob, maybe a ring or something.  He was only up for a short time and wasn't found.  I'm going to join the raid next time and confirm myself.  The trackers are reliable sources though.  The mob is there someplace and I'm sure it's not a mob to kill, but something different.  A quest mob or something similar to the new Hate.</div></div><hr />

I wonder cuz, if they were going to put Veeshan in the game I personally would have thought it'd make more sense to put her in PoSky where she belongs...<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is (like has been suggested) a trigger mob to a ring which could yield more of an Avatar of Veeshan than the god herself. (And, more to the point, perhaps there's a PoSky revamp comin soon)</div></div><hr />

<br />
People have tracked to where it is and there is nothing to be seen.  It's most likely just an &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;awe&quot; feature to the zone for people to actually see Veeshan on track.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Avatar of Veeshan is already IN PoSky, and has been since the day it opened:<br />
<br />
The Hand of Veeshan</div></div><hr />
