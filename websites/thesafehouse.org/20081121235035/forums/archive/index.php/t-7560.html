<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Morek the rogue</div><div class="date">05-19-01, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive played 2 characters up to lvl 50+. Countless others up to lvl 20, all on a blue server. Ive done raids of every kind. Im just BORED now. Raids arent fun, exping is boring, loot is meaningless, so I am thinking of trying out a zek.<br />
<br />
I just read an awsome post about life on the Zek's, it looks like the kind of thing I would like. So I now have a few questions, forgive me if they seem trivial to you pvp vets, but Im new to this hehe.<br />
<br />
Before the sanctuary lvls, I made a character on there to see what it was like. Basically it was die, zone, lose newbie tunic, die on the way back to my corpse, rinse repeat. Some people told me it wasnt like that after a certain lvl (different servers had different lvls that it &quot;got better&quot; at, but all seemed to say basically the same thing). <br />
<br />
So, what is it like at mid to high lvls (20+)? Is it bascially just regular everquest except that you dont have to type /d before you fight? Is pking something that happens regularly? Have any of you made groups for the soul purpose of hunting other players (hehe sounds like it would be fun, not sure if its done tho)? Do players actually set out on certain days with the soul purpose of picking a fight, or is that considered against the &quot;unwritten rules&quot;? Is pking something that will give me a bad rep (bad rep as opposed to a blue server bad rep &quot;hes a ninja looter, dont group with him&quot;, just an example) or is it over looked?<br />
<br />
Also, what classes are the best for this type of play? I am an avid duler on my server, but dueling seems to be completely different from pvp. On a blue server, dueling a Bard if you are a melee is considered suicide for example. The reason for that is song kiting, but on a Zek, it would seem that, that method of killing would be to slow to be really deadly. What classes seem to be the best at this? Rogues I know have awsome damage output, but our hit points are low. Or would a caster be more deadly? I would like to play something that is able to defend himself, and finish a fight that I start. Basically I dont want to spend most of my on-line time looking for my corpse rather than having fun.<br />
<br />
Once again, my appologies if these questions are stupid. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-19-01, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I've only played on RZ primarily, so can't tell you much about the team servers, other then that they are an entirely different world :)<br />
<br />
On Rallos, yes, past about level 15-20 or so, the random PK'ing drops off quickly, but it's never completely gone. There are plenty of unwritten rules, and I could probably write a book on them, and when they do/don't apply, the variations, etc. you pretty much have to play and just learn them hehe. Never played on a blue server, I can't be more then vague about the differences there either. Generally, random PK'ing is frowned on, but there are guilds who have that as their primary goal. These people are often despised, especially those who use less then honorable tactics to accomplish their goals. There are guilds who oppose these people (like mine).<br />
<br />
On occasion people will form groups to hunt other people, but on RZ it's not really that common. Because of only a +-4 level range, you can't always find people to hunt, and tracking them down is hard as well. Plus there are many ways to escape, especially if your a caster.<br />
<br />
Rogues are very good at PvP, moreso if they are the attacker. With a good backstab, a quad, poison, and a successful disarm you can really knock an opponent off their feet if they aren't paying attention. Lag kills ya though :/<br />
<br />
Anyway I suggest trying it out on Rallos, play to at least 20 before deciding... if you can handle it ;p<br />

&quot;Its not that I dont think you have the guts to come to rallos, I<br />
 just want you to come so I can kick yer arse is all.&quot;-Diabalein Avidya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cylant</div><div class="date">05-19-01, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">C'mon over to rallos!<br />
I suggest playing a shaman, they really rock at pvp.<br />
INT-Casters are really weak at defense, and can be killed pretty easily.<br />
Melees are really bad at keeping people from running away.<br />
Hybrids are great for duels as well as pvp.<br />
<br />
Shamen have decent hit points, armor class, dots, nukes, and a fun little pet.  I'd say the same for druids, but they have no way of lowering resists, and they just plain suxor(i hate them).<br />
<br />
As for what i do on rallos - i basicly play the game like everyone on a blue server - with the added flavor of always watching my back for potential predators or prey.  The use of PvP in resolving problems is always fun, though many mid levelers are scared to ruin reputation over a disagreement.<br />
<br />
Random pking on rallos *will* give you a bad rep, but it dosnt mean you can't kill people - you just have to kill the scum(darkenbane, house in'visus, peace of formitas, meretix de bellum - they all seem to be random gankers).  At low levels you can get away with a little pk'ing, but if you do it higher up - everyone will hear about it. 											Cylant Butdeadly<br />

Go with the new server or with Vallon Zek as a pure team player. Roleplay the game whatever server you choose.               Fricka       of the Vallon Zek Shanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lirin TZ</div><div class="date">05-19-01, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, i was going to answer this earlier, but i had to go ingame for a long time, you all know how it is =P   <br />
<br />
i also suggest you play characters to 20+ before you make your decision about PvP and the server.  on the team servers PKing will get you a rep, a good rep =)  about heading out to just hunt players, i go do that all the time, sometimes alone, sometimes we get a group of guildmates togeather and raid a darky dungon like najena(most recent one).  kill darkys, get some exp, and get some phat lewtz    on the other hand, if you get the rep as a exp killer, or a bind rusher/corpse camper, you WILL NOT get a group. <br />
<br />
classes.  shaman, like cylant said, is pretty good.  my personal favorites are druid(my main), SK, and monk.  druids basically because they can do a little bit of anything.  sow, snare, buffs, DS(one of your best weapons aginst melees), and all the other stuff that makes them so good at PvE as well.  SK because its basically a warrior with casting ability.  darkness, lifetaps, DoT's plus a good ammount of HP, make it vary hard to both kill and escape you.  monks are just awsome.  with fast weapons its almost impossible for a cster chanell a spell off onto you.  one of the best offensive PvP classes.  your dammage is just so amazeing from all angles (as opposed with back only for rogues) makes you hard to stop.  <br />
<br />
the way it works on tallon, is that the PKing never stops.  it will slow down when you get enough HP and mana to fight back and not just die if you are attacked.  you can still go PK any time you want, with no real consiquences.  half the times you dont even have to look for it, it will come to you with minimal effort =P  though, if you dont want PKing, its not impossible to find a zone with all lights, or all darks in it. most of tallon is Light V Dark, with the exception of some one team guilds or one team PK guilds(vary honorable guilds as a matter of fact).  <br />
<br />
anyways, a good place to go to see the politics on tallon is pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735 here.  <br />
