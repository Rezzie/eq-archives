When i try and turn in my pieces from iki raids he says he does not recognize those pieces and tells me to go back and find the clues. i show to have everything done but not showing the artifacts i turned in that he does not recognize, the 3 missing clues and icon of altar which he will not tell me to do yet.  Can anyone tell me what the 3 clues are? And what i might be doing wrong.  I hope people still use this thread for help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corboy</div><div class="date">11-09-04, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you do the Passage Quest? Gather relics from like close to the yxtta zone line for a while each is different and there are 4. Then you got to do the gathering flesh and sewing the stuff together. Then you have to do Pit of the lost, basically go collect more relics from Undead names in the north part of Kod'taz. Summoner Ring and the Little Side Temple of the damed quest I dont know if you have to do them as well or not to turn in the raid pieces. Think it's just:<br />
(win the three 1 group trials)<br />
4 relics from the passage<br />
4 pieces of skin sew it together to give the drawf<br />
4 relics from the named ghost you combine in a bag.<br />
hand bag to drawf to spawn dude that splits and drops another relic piece<br />
hand that relic piece in to start raids..<br />
then I think you can hand in the raid pieces and finish it off. <br />
If you have done all that stuff then probly need summoner ring and that Temple quest to finish it off. Im not totally sure.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong on all of it and yeah Im not to imformative, but you get the general idea. You can do all this stuff, but really nothing special about it other than being able to start the raids.</div></div><hr />
