<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Legna Nellaf</div><div class="date">09-08-99, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last couple nights i have been in highhold. Been there even longer, but this tale I speak of is from the last couple nights there. So sit a spell, and listen to my confused tale. It is a little lengthy, so if time is short, you might not want to hear of it. <br />
   Firstly, lets say that I am a darkelf female. Next bring up the fact that yes, I am evil at heart. And lastly, for those who are having trouble hearing what I am saying, I do not know your commonspeak. Let the tale begin. <br />
   I arrived in highhold, and after a little creeping around I realized that there were not many people around. So I went to the gnolls, where I have learned recently my skills pay off quite well. There was a group there. A rather odd group at that, but a troll was amongst them, so I crept closer feeling that they might be useful to me at this moment. And asked the troll if he could gain consent for my joining them. Undoubtedly he relayed this to them, and they all began considering my powers in comparison to their own. And they see I am weaker I am sure, thus no reply is ever recieved.  <br />
   Well, this not being the first time that I have been ignored or turned down, I do not worry much. Instead, I watch the last rays of sunlight bounce off of my blade, and smile. My time of day is coming. I rest secretly by the guard awaiting nightfall, and envisioning my moaneuvers through my head trying to become one with the tools already in my hands. <br />
   Darkness falls, and I leep to my feet, gaining a fairly high vantage point, and await a gnoll to come into my sight. There he is, most likely a guard, I see him scanning the path. So I pounce, slamming my dagger home, and swinging my tommahawk at its head, missing, but I have it's full attention. The group joins in, but I dont stop, I stab its arm as it swings at me, and swing the axe into its chest, pushing towards it, refusing to stop for even a moment. It falls, I lift the change from it's purse and go back up to my perch, awaiting the next one patiently. <br />
   Well, I take down at least 3 of these things when this short dwarf starts yelling at me, calling me a killstealer? Well, in any case whatever this killstealer is it is obviously an insult as his face is all gnarled up. I shrug off his poor attempts at attacking me. And ask if he would like to group again. All I recieve back from this short person are more insults and telling me i am not welcome there, and I best not try to attack one of the gnoll leaders.  <br />
   So another battle ensues, and I see the dwarf casting a spell as darkness overtakes me. Now my nerves are being plucked at, you may be rude to me, but do not think you own any area that I wish to be at. So I return and point out to him that if he messes with my head again, I will seperate his from his shoulders. (Although I doubt he understood me) because he decided now would be a good time to do just that. SO I attacked him for his failed efforts, and the group of them attacked me. I managed to get away, and sent word to my guild. A little while later a wood elf appeared, and began speaking to me in the darkspeak. She said that one of my sisters bade her come to help me. So we began to take all that we wanted, and little could be done by the little dwarf Anchor, or the troll Balial. After a good night of hunting and riches myself and her retired, saying our goodbyes, and telling her to thank the sister who sent her. <br />
   Now for the funny part, I return long afterwards, and the two were still there. Still trying to get one of the tommahawks that the gnolls carry. (one like mine) I smile and ask those others there if any would like to group. A paladin speaks up. *grumbles* I can feel the utter goodness radiating from him. But my mind is not dull. Those like him are bound by their words, and will always protect any they are with. So I accept. Not thinking why he knows my language so well. While we are hunting he says he too wished that he had a tommahawk. But he may never get one as we are no where near where the last gnoll with one was seen. We were close to the karanas. <br />
   So I go scouting between fights, it is good to keep nimble you know, jumping from the cliffs each time rolling back onto my feet to continue running. It fills me with vigor to do this. Well, I run through the arch leading towards the keep, and there are the two I have grown to dislike already fighting a gnoll, I pass them quickly, silently wishing them death in their fight, and run up the ramp along the side of the path, and there it was. A large gnoll with a gleaming tommahawk in his hands. It was too late for me, I was too close already, so I slid my dagger into him hoping for a quick end to this. Didnt happen, it just scratched him, and the fight began. I quickly shouted to my ally what I had found and what I was fighting. He wasnt going to be there in time. I was near death, and my enemy didnt look very worn from the fight yet. Then as darkness is pulling me away from the world I see him charging at the beast, his hands glowing a bright blue and i feel full of energy and vigor again. The Tommahawk releases a force into me, and my bloodclaw glows its vile green aura. My wounds have vanished, ad the beast cannot even harm me. A smile coming across my face as I realize the fight is once again to my advantage. I begin tearing the beast apart, my blades slicing, poking and cutting the creature. I can hear the weapons hit its bones, the blood flowing from it, and it falls to its knees on the ramp, running from us. Then collapses to the ground lifeless.  <br />
   Was about that time that the dwarf and troll came by, so I said aloud and in darkspeak (even though the paladin didnt understand) tha the could have the axe, i dont need trinkets. Quickly repeating it within the group, and the paladin took the weapon. That little dwarf's face was red with rage. I just smiled right at him, laughing. Would have been his if not for his greed and poor comments to me about myself, my race, and my guild. The paladin meanwhlie was ecstacic. So, one that would have been an enemy benefited from me, just because it suited me to get my revenge on another.  <br />
   On a side note the paladin had to leave shortly afterward, he was gaining a large headache. It seems the troll and dwarf would not stop telling him that he should GIVE it to them as it should have been theirs, not his. I laughed myself to sleep that night. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cyric</div><div class="date">09-09-99, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent story sister.  I myself had a similar experiance in highhold. <br />
  <br />
 I needed to kill some time as I was waiting for my guild brothers and sisters to arrive.  So I thought I'd see if I could could find one of the Mucktail brothers and procure their items for a friend.  Being a rogue of the 33rd circle back then I could easily handle the brothers.   <br />
  <br />
 So I crept up to their arrival point and had just started to get comfortable when I was set upon by a very ugly and very fowl smelling halfhuman druid of the twenty fifth circle with no guild affiations at all.  This halfpint insisted on knowing my intentions toward the mucktail brothers.  I assured him that my intentions where lethal and he began issisting that he had been waiting for them for three hours and that therefore I should give him first go.  Images of this little creature running around highhold with one of the brothers chasing him until a guard joined in and conficated the weapon I wanted dance in my head but I said nothing as my time was short anyway.  My guildmates had arrived and we were busy discussing the nights activities.  I was preparing to leave when the tiny little halfman broke into our conversation and insisted that had not answered his question about if I were going to allow him first go around.  At this point I felt that this migit needed to be taught humility.  My reply was simply &quot;What do you think halfling?&quot;  Apparently this angred the pipsqueek because he began demanding an answer to a question he should have known.  Do I have to go get one of my 30th level caster friends? Yes.   <br />
  <br />
 At this point he plops down and disappears only to have what I would assume was his big sister a halfling druid of the 30th level, say she was coming to make sure that she got to kill the mucktails herself.  After waiting a few minutes I sent her back a message that one of the brothers had showed and that I had gotten his tomahawk so I was leaving :).  This apparently upset her greatly because she then started calling for my blood and demanding that I stay where I was so I could fight her in a duel to the death -- I gets rudeness runs in the family.   <br />
  <br />
 My friend had arrived but I needed to run to bank in the keep -- told her I was in highkeep to give the tomahawk to a friend.  I had better things to do so I went with a friend to seek out and kill some brigant name Flamestrike or something to that effect.  At this point she arrived in the pass and began shouting to all assembled that I was a coward and would not duel her.  So I returned to the mucktail arrival point and agreed end her pitiful life. <br />
 As the duel began another of my friends arrived. <br />
  <br />
 The duel was short.  She began by putting a poison spell on my and I began by dispelling ALL the magic on her with my pumice.  At this point we both retreted a bit and I applied pumice to myself while she reapplied magic to herself -- I understand my friend also canceled a few :).  At this point I reactivated my journeyman boots and began to wade into her while she simply tried to hit me with a staff.  In a matter of seconds she lay on the ground dead and I moved on to that nights hunting event. <br />
  <br />
 A few hours later she sent me a message that she had lost concessness during the battle and insisted that I kill her again.  Since I was off hunting I told her she had to wait.  A few days later I ran into her little brother again and defeated him in a duel where he fled like a cowardly dog and he too insisted that he lost concessness.  I was around the corner reworking my strategy at the time otherwise I would have kill him too.  Still after all this they would not leave me alone for a while and I will duel them no more until they get that concessness thing fixed. <br />
  <br />
 Legna they hate you because you are a dark elf but and you refuse to sacrifice your beliefs to please them.  We are powerful and they are weak, whatever you do don't change for them. <br />
