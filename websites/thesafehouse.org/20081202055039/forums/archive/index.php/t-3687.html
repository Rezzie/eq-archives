Last 2 months people have been dying and respawning with no penalty apart from wounding. Well the devs have now put forward a new plan on the death penalty that is in testing<br />
<br />
Each time you get incapped every item decays 3%. Upon death and respawning they decay further 20%. Most people who know about this update on the test server are up in arms. But as usual I can see this coming live on the next monthly update. <br />

Maybe make wounding more severe.  Because of the long travel times associated with getting killed out in the field, I think that is totally enough penalty.  I've had to get my corpse a few times while it was an active penalty and I hated it.<br />

Means people will pay me to rez!<br />
<br />
Sick of being a master doc with 40 rez kits collecting dust while people beg for buffs.<br />
<br />
I'm kinda shocked the game went this far with no major death penalty.  Allowed an entire generation of clueless newbs to get master in a few weeks. <br />
 <br />
 It's only wrong if you get caught.If  consequences dictate my course of action I should play GOD<br />

Wow a reason to form a group.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, I rarely die doing actuall missions.  I usually get killed running out to check my harvestors when I'm by myself.  Nothing pisses me off more than having something red spawn on top of me and kill me after running 20 minutes to get to my harvestor.<br />

Seriously though, this penalty plus the reduction in pay outs per mission is gonna leave me seriously strapped for cash.  Biral Infectionn <br />

<br />
And whats funny is its not even intentional.  They used to have you do CRs just like in EQ, but they couldn't fix the bug where people's corpses kept dissapearing, so they had to disable it.<br />
<br />
Corpse retrieval is just one of those awful artifacts of EQ that alot of MMORPGs adopt that are one of the most miserable things in the genre.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, one of my friends plays a master doctor AND master combat medic.  And let me tell you, he runs through res kits pretty fast with us.  And the AoE poisons and diseases are DEVASTATING in PvP.  Not to mention that the buffs are great.  Especially since he's a wookie so he wears all stat enhancing clothing.  Not only that, but he has some clothing with +medicine use which I hear you can't make anymore(kinda like I have this probot with 3000+ HAM which you can't make anymore).  So he's mad with the healing skills. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />

You died, it is something you should not do. Something you may want to try hard to avoid. Be careless, and you need to go get help, or a rogue (in eq)<br />
<br />
Sure it sucks, that is kinda the point. It also helps to motivate people to group, as groups get wiped less often than a solo person if you are in a place where CR would actually be any type of a chore.<br />

No, the point is for the game to be fun, and nothing brings an enjoyable evening to a screeching halt like having to run out into the middle of nowhere naked.  So that I can then run back to town to get some more missions(cause you can't get missions without your weapons otherwise you get like difficulty 5 noobie missions(unless your a teras kati artist)). &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me it removes any pride in achieving anything when it is all handed to you on a platter. I like having a penalty. Something to keep my silly side in check. I have done plenty of amazingly stupid things, even with the penalties in place. Lost a corpse once due to it. <br />
<br />
Didn't stop me from playing and having fun. Hell, most times it gave me a reason to get to know more people, generally those that were willing to help us retrieve our corpses.<br />
<br />
You don't have to like it just because I do. But you do have to let me like it, unless you have some crazy mind control abilities I am unaware of. <br />

<br />
Doesn't that seem oh, I don't know, @#%$ing insane to anyone else?<br />
<br />
I mean debating over whether to have a penalty or not, I can understand.. but that choice seems totally over the top to me, whether you agree a penalty is needed or not. Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

<br />
there isnt no penalty though, you still get sent back to town when you die, and unless you pay the cash for a clone, you have a @#%$ of wounds.<br />
<br />
I mean hell, we failed the storyline mission today and got respawned in the nearest town which was like, no @#%$ lie, a half hour away.  And on top of that, after dying with 1 mob left out of the original twelve, we now basically have to start over.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The idea is workable, but they are @#%$ it up.  First of all, 3% item decay just for getting incapped?  I get incapped like 50 times a @#%$ day.  You shouldn't be penelized just for getting knocked down.<br />
<br />
If they want to cause 20% decay on items when you die, fine.  But you have to be able to insure items so that doesn't happen.  Insuring items was supposed to be this great money sink they came up with where you paid money to insure items and when you died these items respawned with you instead of on your corpse.  Now they feel all that effort is wasted cause CRs don't exist.  So if they are gonna do something that @#%$ horrible, make it so the insurance does something again.  Insure the items you don't want to decay when you die, its that simple. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never said anything about item decay being a good thing. the percentages listed seem extremely steep, at least compared to how often I tend to die in games.<br />
<br />
The travel time will likely be a lot more reasonable when they finally put those vehicles that will be in at launch into the game.<br />

I had the same problem.  For me that mission is on Lok and a long (and dangerous) fricken run.  Dying blows at least 40 minutes and if your wounds are bad you have to heal up before you head out.  It is a huge time sink.  I haven't completed it simply because I ran out of time and had to log.  I'm enjoying this bit of story line though.<br />
