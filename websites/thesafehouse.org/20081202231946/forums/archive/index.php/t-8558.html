<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bootygrabber</div><div class="date">05-29-03, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay I've been combing the board trying to see if this has come up before, and there are a few questions like it, but not with the answer I was looking for.  Anyways my question is this: Is the first half of the epic nessicary? and by first half I mean all steps prior to spawning Renux.<br />
<br />
and heres why I ask, first, I went to pp Tauny today, some jacka** lvl 60 npc quad hit me for 300+ killed me in 1 second flat after a failed attempt. I have 200 pp skill, and yeah I'm lvl 47 but I think that its about the right time to start gathering these items.  second reason, I've done the shaman epic (no longer have the character) but I bypassed 2 steps of the quest by doing faction work which consisted of sub-quest step repitition seeing as to trigger the final fight really only required an item dropped and looted rather than acquired through a previous step of the quest and max faction, which the quest really was all about.  Leading me to believe that once you grab the BoS from hate the only thing preventing you from sucessfully spawning Renux would be faction, am I wrong? and once youve got the box to spawn the Gen, the tattered note has nothing to do with the completion of the quest, correct?<br />
<br />
I'm asking because I do not know the answer to this.  What do you think? Infamus Bootygrabber<br />

<br />
But, there's no way to get around, you need to pick the notes. Unless you have someone who will turn in the box and let you loot their pouch, give you the JDD and CQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
But that's not very likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Phack</div><div class="date">05-29-03, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes its necessary, and frankly it seems quite lazy to avoid it.  Its not like its overly difficult.<br />
<br />
Yes you can have someone else pick the nots.<br />
Yes you can probably buy them in the bazaar if you look.<br />
<br />
But thats really no fun, and defeats the entire idea IMO.</div></div><hr />

Sure it's an awesome weapon, but what's the point in playing a role playing game if you don't do the epic it's suppose to be done? Sure a lot of people have it, but SoE would lose customers if more people couldn't get it. I've done the druid epic and i started at 50 took me two levels to finish it. The rogue epic is already easy, don't make it any worse.</div></div><hr />

You can do the rogue epic in 1 day if you're a bit lucky too.  I know I spend more time on some other quests than on the epic quest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kettamina</div><div class="date">06-24-03, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it took me 4 or 5 spawns on founy to get the note, i just sat there on a saturday afternoon watching tv hiting PP every now and then. also had s0w and druid skin on just incase i agro'd only died once cause i got stunned. but it was more or less easy, the delf note was cake.<br />
<br />
there is a great epic walk thru full pic's and info i dont know the site off my head so someone else can port it fantastic or i will when i get home.  though i did kill renux last night she wasnt all that hard though i didnt know if to kite her or to tank her. wound up going with a 63monk 57shaman 52 war 50war 54 ranger and myself a 50rogue. only deaths where ranger 1/2way and shaman at end and we tanked her   she spawns right on top of yendar and agro'd the shaman immed</div></div><hr />
