Shirou Emiya lost his parents in a fire when he was young and was later adopted by a sorceror by the name of Kiritsugu Emiya. Although he was full of admiration for his adopted father and yearns to become an ally of justice, Shirou has limited powers and was unable to become a strong sorceror like his father. <br />
<br />
That is until one fateful day, he was drawn into the Holy Grail War and had to summon a female &quot;Servant&quot; known as Saber in order to protect himself. It turns out that the Holy Grail War involves a series of battles among powerful sorcerors to fight for the possession of a relic that will grant one's wishes, the Holy Grail. <br />
<br />
There are altogether seven &quot;Masters&quot; who can summon their respective &quot;Servants&quot; from different classes. These &quot;Servants&quot; have to hide their names in order not to reveal their weaknesses to the enemies. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-09-06, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm, sounds pretty interesting. Gonna have to look into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-09-06, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, for me, this series ended up very mediocre. It has some memorable scenes, and I still watch it as a Type-Moon fanboy, but there were simply too many problems with this series, most notably the pacing. Some of the animation was pretty questionable and low-quality. I.e. Archer's pose in a certain fight, where he stopped midair to pose for the camera. Please...<br />
<br />
Many important plot points from the game were skipped, while this is not a big problem by itself- when there was plenty of time to add them in (hello, flashbacks? long drawn-out talking that could have been condensed?) it becomes an issue.<br />
<br />
Either way, I'm generally happy with the show, but I'm uncertain how people who haven't played the game will react to this. It's still enjoyable to watch for a very strong story and pretty good character development.</div></div><hr />

I'll tell you after I have seen it :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">05-09-06, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm enjoying it a lot, mostly because I don't have to think when watching it- instead, I find myself just kinda going with the flow as the story continues. I usually try to guess out what will happen (in most things I do, whether it be anime, video games, movies, books, etc), but I find myself not doing it for this series, which is a refreshing change.<br />
<br />
<br />
And saber is wicked cool- she can come &quot;save&quot; me anytime she wants :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
:spew<br />
<br />
I just enjoy the story really....the battles are pretty cool like that one battle*....but overall they are not super good.<br />
<br />
*Like when archer did UBW battle in eps 14...now that was an awesome fight story heh.If you have not seen eps 14+ do not read this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">05-11-06, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">eps 17-18<br />
<br />
They where pretty good. I liked how masters finally fight each other =P. Altho the way sabers powers where taken away like that was pretty lame. And how about that preview in eps 18! All I can say is this dude is going to be bad ass =P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ummm holy crap man lol think we just ruined it for ppl here =/. Altho i seen enough spoilers that it was ruined a long time ago :P<br />
<br />
Awww they went on a date!! lol. But holy hell was that preview for eps 21 a total spoiler =/ its allmost like wtf why did you give away the whole eps =/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-27-06, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Episode 21<br />
<br />
BAD END, GAME OVER! Haha.<br />
<br />
Shirou keeps dying again. Two times in one episode, to boot! Whee. So it is Gate of Babylon, and he is Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes. I can't wait for the upcoming climax! What will happen?!<br />
<br />
I swear to god, if they go a different route from teh game and have Saber+Shirou defeat everyone with a single blow from Clairnet again, I'll go ape ****. Hercule's death was pathetic enough, even moreso pathetic how they made Archer seem so weak that he was defeated by the guy who got defeated 7 times by a single stab. Gah.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've entered me so many times&quot; oh my.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">06-19-06, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, nobody posted about the last episode at all?<br />
<br />
I for one don't like the fact that it's over already... 'twas too damn short!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh i just been waiting...to me they started out really strong in plot then it just got weaker in the end. Mind you its still a good series just wish they didn't make it short with a weak ending =/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-19-06, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Episode 24<br />
<br />
Not that anyone doubted this outcome... but nothing all that interesting about the ending as one who played the game. The ending I wished for:<br />
<br />
Alternate Game Ending spoiler and Archer's identy revealed:<br />
<br />
Shirou whipping out Unlimited Blade Works<br />
<br />
Too bad. The animation was pretty good this episode (disregarding Eclipse's horrible encoding)<br />
<br />
It was nice seeing Saber with her hair down. The death of King Arthur :(</div></div><hr />

 Heh true that would have been cooler :P. But I wish they would do the dark saber one but they won't oh well :P. And sup with Eclipse anyway? their divx encodes are better then their h264 ones lol IMO.</div></div><hr />

The visuals are great!</div></div><hr />
