I read that doombringers book about how the creators wanted to crush us and blah blah entombed blah blah we pwn. <br />
<br />
Now, my thinking is thus. &quot;The Creators&quot; somehow got out of their little hole and released the Wailing Death on us all to finish what they started. <br />
<br />
I just really hope I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lerkin Behinja</div><div class="date">06-22-02, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a similar premonition, but nothing to do with Wailing Death or Creators.  I could tell within the first ten minutes who the main baddie would be.  Kinda popped out at me.  But, I HATE that damn Denstar (Densther?  The Helm guy that you meet first in the Stables when trying to stop Waterdhavian creatures from escaping)  Too bad you can't kill him then.<br />
<br />
On a more random note, I can tell you how Minority Report will end.  Haven't seen the movie; just one commercial.<br />
<br />
Think Greek tragedy.  You'll understand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Working through Chapter 3 right now... and still in shock from the end of chapter 2... was one of those cases where I was kicking myself for not seeing it earlier =/<br />
<br />
Chapter 1 wasn't anywhere near as suprising but was quite depressing however...<br />
<br />
Whomever did the story for it needs to be commended... and, uhm, needs to invite me to any online campaigns s/he does...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mdar kelf</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was a surpise to me in chapter one... <br />
Poor poor Airibeth(sp)<br />
<br />
When chapter 2 started I couldn't help but laugh at that cleric....</div></div><hr />

Vac, the thing that really threw me off was I had been talking to her constantly, and she had even given me her ring, and the journal entry said I should hold onto it if I wanted her story to continue in the next chapter.  Then, when I entered Luskum (sp?) it poofed with the other unneeded plot items :/<br />
<br />
Anyways, how far are you in 3?<br />
I just got the second one, so far, one from the north and one from the west of the camp. &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ... Some people just become stupid with more authority.&quot; -- Terry Pratchett</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vaclav Romanov</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've only gotten 1 so far in chapter 3... the snow globe one... (prolly the North one you mention)<br />
<br />
I hadn't been keeping tabs on her so I didn't get the whole ring angle, did have an item like that in the first chapter though Masterson Family Amulet - I didn't disappear, but there was an incomplete quest attached to it when I finished up Chapter 1...<br />
<br />
And that halfling at the bar at the start of Chapter 2.... I swear that was another case where I screamed 'I knew it!' at my monitor, wonder if reacting to it differently is actually scripted in though...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vaclav Romanov</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And update....<br />
<br />
Just beat the single player campaign... still reeling from how good it was... it's rare for me to buckle down and beat something and even rarer yet to be ready for a second run at it right away...<br />
<br />
A++++ game =D</div></div><hr />

I had to export and start chapter 4 over, got stuck inside you know where :P &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ... Some people just become stupid with more authority.&quot; -- Terry Pratchett</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you saved before the fights you really might wanna go back and try it again... it's a weird weird fight and took me a little while to get a plan down, but I managed it as a Level 17 cleric, with both my pet and henchman dead - and mainly with melee at that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zulian</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I beat it a couple hours ago, Vac :P<br />
You'd be amazed how well that Horrid Writing spell works, expecially when you can summon demons to melee :P &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ... Some people just become stupid with more authority.&quot; -- Terry Pratchett</div></div><hr />
