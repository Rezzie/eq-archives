<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greldek</div><div class="date">06-22-00, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering through Oasis of Marr, and saw a nice group of people killing spectres.<br />
I went up to 'em, and got an unexpected clarity... was wondering why would anyone give rogue a clarity? But didn't question the nice enchantress... its the thought that counts I guess. I sat down and started chatting with a mage, then a spectre spawned, an' they jumped on it...an so did I. I figure they could use my help since there was no way I could possibly steal the kill.  I asked the mage,&quot;Hey, you folks killin' all the <br />
specs?&quot;  , Mageguy,&quot;Yup we sure are.&quot;  Hhhmm..... I always wanted to see whats at the top of the ladder,<br />
they said they kill 'em all... so I run up the ladder, and DIE!!!!  A Spectre rips your head off and throws it out the window!! Ahhgg...   buncha liars!!!!!!  Oohhhh hurray back in Surefall Glade. Start the long run to Oasis.<br />
Well... finally after another death in Kithicor, by an angry Risen Commander  , I get back to Oasis. NOOO!!!<br />
They aren't hunting specs anymore   ahhhrggg!!!!!!!!!!!  *See's some commotion outta the corner of his eye* <br />
So I swim across the lake, and see a group killing Deep Water Goblins, about 5 of 'em. <br />
&quot;Hail! Fellow Rogue!&quot;<br />
&quot;Sup?&quot;<br />
&quot;Can any of you cast Invis vs Undead?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nope sorry, why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well.... I kinda climbed up the ladder in the tower on the island... and died.&quot;<br />
Suddenly I, the necromancer and the enchanter are floating.(Nec an ENC were in DWG group)<br />
&quot;Whoa!!! Dead man floatin'!! Thanks.&quot;<br />
Mr. Necromancer says, &quot;come on we'll get your body back.&quot;<br />
Then the Enchanter gets a brand spankin' new pet, a spectre, the necromancer sicks his pet on a different spectre. While I sit there an' watch the spectres fall, they finally get the one at the top of the ladder down,<br />
the enchanters charm spell wears off... it's re-charmed! Finally the last spectre is dead, and the necro says,<br />
&quot;Go get your body, and drag it to shore, we'll protect ya while ya loot.&quot;... Well... I got to see what's<br />
at the top of the ladder, a buncha Greldek's blood, and a fire. So I drag my corpse where the group was waiting, and pullin' goblins. Got all my equipment, offered 'em money for helpin' me, but they said its no problem.   Decided to go enjoy Dead man floating, while it lasted. Runnin' all around.<br />
*sings: Lallallallallala*  AHH S*^% Sand Giant!!!!!!!!!!!!!           Dead once again!<br />
<br />
F(*&amp;amp;!!!!!!!!!! BACK IN QEYNOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
At that point I logged off.   Greldek Draegonbayte<br />

<br />
You *do* know that hidden rogues are automatically invisible to undead as well as regular mobs, right?  There are some creatures that can still see us, and sometimes a creature that normally can't see us will catch a glimpse and attack.  But for the most part, your sneak/hide will work just as well against undead as the living.<br />
<br />
I've heard debates about spectres.  In my experience they can't see us, but I might have just gotten lucky.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I thought it was worth mentioning.   Bayler<br />
