<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">02-02-07, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Afro Samurai is done already on Spike TV after five episodes.  I did not see it entirely but felt the pacing, character development, action scenes, and storyline was disappointing.  There's just not enough time to develop the characters in five half hour episodes, and the hip hop just seems tacked on as an afterthought.<br />
<br />
Anyone else watch this series?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">02-02-07, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the entire series was about a guy climbing a mountain to get to the man at the top - that doesn't really make for a 26 episode series.<br />
<br />
I thought it was fine, though I think there was a little too much explaining at the end and I wish they would've gone with a simpler concept even more closely resembling Bruce Lee's 'Game of Death', going level to level while defeating each opponent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">02-03-07, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The show was essentiall plotless more or less.<br />
<br />
It was a show with 25 minutes of fighting in a half hour show.<br />
<br />
I loved it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">02-03-07, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plus the mother ******* afro on the mother ******* samurai. :rofl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">02-03-07, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had no idea this show was only five episodes.  I guess that explains why the Empty Seven all died in about 20 minutes.  I was expecting anime pacing, where that would fill at least half a year...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I enjoyed it.  The fight scenes were really good (particularly Robo-Afro), and that's really all it needed to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">02-05-07, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched one episode and was sorry I did so.<br />
But I also didnt care for Samurai Gun.  Uzi's in the 1400's?<br />
I can suspend reality with the best of them but an anime trying to make itself out to be a peroid piece then throwing in uzi's is stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">02-05-07, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't your avatar a pirate with a laser gun?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">02-06-07, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of the time it's the 1400s, the other part of the time, it's a post apocolyptic setting.  And it doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
The ending loses any sort of poetic force with Jinno being voice acted as an unsympathetic Tom Cruise intensity style acting crybaby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">02-07-07, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't your avatar a pirate with a laser gun?<br />
<br />
Yes it is. :D<br />
The difference is however that the pirate with a lazer gun is supposed to be comedy.<br />
Samurai Gun tries to be serious.<br />
<br />
Its like stuck up british people doing a absolutely-serious documentry about the mating habits of puppets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that was a great five part series.</div></div><hr />

Today Spike is showing all five episodes of Afro Samurai back-to-back.  In my area it's airing from 7pm to 9:30 pacific time.</div></div><hr />
