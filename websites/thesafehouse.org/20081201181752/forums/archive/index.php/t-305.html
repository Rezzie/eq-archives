<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">03-17-00, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me tell you all a story.  Upon this evening I had been hunting the aviaks of the Southern Plains of Karana and came across a fellow Rogue named Vladie.  We spoke for a few moments and he shared with me an ale of a most excellent Dwarven vintage.  Together we bloodied our knives in the backs of several Rooks. We eventually decided to pursue better treasure in the penthouse.  When we arrived and asked the people hunting there for a place among them, the response from their leader (a female druid) was only an insult to me on how she belived I aqcuired my gear.  At such an insult we left to hunt by ourselves.<br />
<br />
Later in the evening when I was alone, I again ventured to the penthouse to observe.  Lo and behold the same vile druid still commanded the room, and they were engaging an aviak harrier.  I calmly walked up behind them all, and stayed hidden from their sight.  And kindly helped myself to a choice gem from the very bird which they fought.  I laughed at them on my leave, and for what, they knew not.<br />
<br />
<br />
OOC:  Okay, I was really mad when she made the comment about me being a twink.  I may not have FOUGHT for much of my gear but I played some shrewed merchanting for it, if I do say so myself.  She took one look at me and said, &quot;Oh, look my new 'Summon Twink Rogue' spell really does work.&quot;  I tried to talk about it but I was ignored.  So when i came back later and they were still there I decided to have a little fun.  Mind you, I'm level 21 and my PP is only at 75, and I had only picked at most 6 gold at a time from anything I've fought.  So you can imagine my elation when I walked up behind them in sneak hide, hit my pp hot key and saw the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've never felt as much like a thief in the game as I did at this moment.  I usually make it a policy not to pp from other people's mobs.  But hey, I need a little retribution.  One pp and I was gone.  And I don't feel bad for them in the least.  It just made it so much sweeter that this was hands down my best pick pocket to date!   <br />

I usually do run-by-robberies on everything I come across, and can either deal with, run from or when it is already in battle.<br />
<br />
I am a level 11 now and my skill is already at 60 and I tend to keep it up  <br />

<br />
Aviaks is INSANE money for pickpocketing, the gems and the possibility to get a black pearl is GREAT.  I'd keep that PP up though - real money will come from Treants : ).  <br />
<br />
Don't worry Not, its easy to be mistaken for a twink if you ahve good equipmen.  I get the same song and dance from twinked necromancers and druids and whatnot.  <br />

&quot;You just can't handle that I am that much better than you at trading.&quot;<br />

I have stolen three black pearls from aviak avocets, and to my surprise I stole one from a gorilla in Cazic Thule. Usually you can't steal from animals, but I just have a habit of pickpockting in battle. Haven't seen one looted since then, though.<br />

I only wish I had my CG =( [b]Delph F'Elon, Teir'Dal assassin Extraordinaire.34th shadow, Lanys T'Vyl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">03-20-00, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heheh, okay, I admit it... I've a little twinky creme to me from the Bloodstained Tunic passed to me by Deluin when he finally got his Ravenscale CG, and that tunic will likewise be passed down to another rogue when I get my CG.  Probably some young up and coming Syndicate member.  <br />
<br />
But the Ravenscale and weapons I wear was all trade items, baby!    The life of the part time merchant can be a good one.  Too bad I blew some of my working capital on a bit too much ravenscale.. heheh.  I was basicly broke after I bought the gloves and boots.  Now saving up some more capital from smaller sells and trades before I go after bigger stuff.  I'm trying to keep myself from buying the jagged bands and BS mantle I want so I can use the plat to make more plat.<br />

I still have the 7 black pearls I am proud to say were all illgotten gains.  Ive been mistaken for a twinked rogue so many times until they actually click on me; wore mostly RS from 30-51</div></div><hr />
