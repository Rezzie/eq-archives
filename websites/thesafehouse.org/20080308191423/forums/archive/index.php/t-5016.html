<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Quaysh</div><div class="date">04-08-02, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Poison FAQ goes into lots of detail abouts skills and such but not much about the effects of the poisons themselves, unless I have missed something. Right now I am mostly only concerned with PvE as I am trying to level up fast to catch up with friends. I am clear on the DoT poison and use it religeously. But I have a couple of other questions:<br />
<br />
- I have heard that Enervating poison lowers the target's hp until it wears off or they die. Does this happen to any target, only buffed targets, or even just other players (RvR only)? Next, does Weakening poison do this too just to a lesser degree, or do you have to wait till you get high enough skill for Enervating? Basically I have been using weakening poison in PvE and I am wondering if it even does anything.<br />
<br />
- what exactly are the effects of disease poison? I know it prevents normal healing and halves healing spells, but for PvE this is not something I have had much need for yet. I also know it has a small snare effect that doesnt go away when you hit next, and this is useful for those times you have to run away. Does it do anything else? Attack speed reduction perhaps? And is anyone finding it useful in PvE?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Answers to your questions have been posted MANY times here. Save us all some time and find them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Quaysh</div><div class="date">04-09-02, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you make a good point. Shift-I may be able to answer some of my questions.<br />
<br />
But I doubt it will tell me if anyone has found weakening poison to be of any use in PvE. Thats kind of subjective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-09-02, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People parsed logs which showed that weakening poisons reduce the chance to hit enemies and reduce their hit points.  More effective in P v E than R v R, in fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bargle13</div><div class="date">04-09-02, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I've used weakening Poisons RvR and they work wonders. Nothing like hitting a Nightshade back with My own venom, then follow up with weakening. The suddenly come to a crawl, and anyone near me has a jolley good time finishing what they started, if my poison doesnt do them first.<br />
<br />
Hehe.<br />
