<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Trebax Shadowstealer</div><div class="date">10-03-03, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">16.)  Backstab dmg softened<br />
<br />
17.)  82 new piercing weapons have been introduced.  Anything with 10+ dmg will be caster only, have 15str and 30sta, and look killer.  Anything below 10 will be rogue inclusive, but will have about 100 mana, 6int or wis, have mana regen LXVII, and look like a butterknife.<br />
<br />
18.)  Sneak/Hide &quot;fixed&quot; again.  Since the button kept going gray, we've decided to just leave it that way...now's it's less distracting.<br />
<br />
19.)  Run-speed no longer affects sneaking.<br />
<br />
20.)  If it rains, snows, or someone farts...hide will no longer function.<br />
<br />
21.)  Added 72 minute timer to hide function.<br />
<br />
22.)  Frogloks can now be rogues!  Instead of backstabbing, they have the unique ability to back-lick.  Works the same, though, unless a fly gets in the way.<br />
<br />
23.)  Worn ATK cap reduced to 15.  That zero at the end was never intended.<br />
<br />
24.)  Items can no longer be pickpocketted from mobs without pockets.<br />
<br />
25.)  Items that are geometric, shiny, weigh more than 0.1 stones, make sound when dropped, follow the laws of physics, or have a name starting with a consonant can no longer be pickpocketted.<br />
<br />
26.)  Sensing traps in LDoN can now set them off, so be careful out there.<br />
<br />
27.)  Rangers have a new AA ability called &quot;Track self&quot;.  This allows them to never get lost, even if they try.  Requires mapping, sense heading skill of 200, and a tracking skill of 250.<br />
<br />
28.)  Monk FD now works without fail while dragging corpses.  This should help monks when they help out during raid wipes.<br />
<br />
29.)  Rogues lose Virtue or any other clerical or paladin buff when pickpocketting, applying poison, or backstabbing.  Makes no sense to have &quot;virtue&quot; whilst swiping something or stabbing someone in the back now, does it?<br />
<br />
30.)  As a result of all the melee &quot;balancing&quot;, we're now focussing all our attention to rebalance casters.  These changes will be made within the next 72 hours, and will be implemented in a patch scheduled for two weeks from today.  If that patch doesn't go on time, we'll credit all caster accounts with 10k platinum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vorax S</div><div class="date">10-03-03, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">31) We will be removing the Sneak and Hide Skills from all rogues as we found to many rogues were scouting during LDON adventures instead of being nothing but a backstabbing Monk. <br />
<br />
32) Correction to number 31, all rogues are now monks with peircing but lose the sneak, hide, pick pocket, backstab abilites and can the martial art attacks of a monk. This is a good thing since now the old rogues can now tank in leather armor instead of getting beat up in thier old chain.<br />
<br />
33) Accounts containing a rogue over level 10 will start being charges 39.95 a month since everyone knows rogues are to powerful and there for it is a honor to pay us more to keep your charecter.<br />
<br />
34) Also we will be removing Pick Locks from Rogues and give it to every other class, rogues try to help the group to much after adventures by opening chests after being told not to touch them.</div></div><hr />

wait... since 26 was serious, does that mean all the rest are too?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Stupid question I know but does SOE have any other kind of GM events? My previous experience with these 'events' has caused me to make it very clear to the group that I will evac out if a GM event enters the zone we're in and anyone who doesn't like it will just have to disband and deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elerion</div><div class="date">10-05-03, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">35) Added a new NPC to Plane of Tranquility. The cleverly named Dozzler Twomirks will answer your hails with the following message: &quot;Hail, friend. Would you like to hear my opinion on the [latest patch message]?&quot; We believe his dialogue will add to the immersion of the game. (WARNING: Language may be considered inappropriate by kids, casters, and SOE employees.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
36) Rogues may now only backstab mobs that have backs. <br />
<br />
37) Poisons are once again interruptable by moving. <br />
<br />
3  Shadowknights now have the Exodus(instant gate) aa. we decided this would go along well with thier instant kill, and divine aura abilities.</div></div><hr />

I always wondered about that...Just where are you getting that 2cp from a skeleton?</div></div><hr />
