<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lobo</div><div class="date">05-24-07, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I love in this game is the world size.<br />
<br />
There are lots of stuff to do at all lvls (maybe not at lvl 50, but a lot at lowbie lvls).<br />
<br />
I've spended most of my time going to dungeons under lvl 20 all over Telon.<br />
<br />
But I've never spended much time on the surface (Yea, Im a dungeon crawler) and I'd like to know of some nice questlines...<br />
<br />
You dont need to explain the whole thing, just say where and why.<br />
<br />
Anything goes, nice rewards, fun stuff, and weird things...<br />
<br />
Some I did:<br />
<br />
On Thestra - <br />
<br />
Lindol Storehouse - lvl 5-8 - nice drops for its lvl. You get a quest in the storehouse outpost on tursh and another once inside.<br />
<br />
Riftseekers - Really nice place. You need a password that gets you teleported all over the place. You get the quest at the academy outpost on tursh. The place has some crazy alter-dimension celing. lvl 8-14<br />
<br />
Khelgors End - Nice rewards for those. The place is huge filled with 3-4dots.<br />
I killed the dwarven king in there once and got a Diplomacy Item. lvl 14-20<br />
<br />
Vault of Heroes - Nice place filled with gnols and (leser?)giants... The boss drops some nice yealow itens. lvl 14+-<br />
<br />
Cave of Ururog - A bunch of trolls and bears. Some nameds. Its fun to walk near the trolls... They make the place trumble... lvl 14+-<br />
<br />
Some spider cave on Veskals - You get a bunch of quests to this place on veskals. Lots of spiders. Some nameds. Its fun to open a bunch of eggs just to see the spiderlings run to the next group while you watch on stealth... lvl 12+-<br />
<br />
Some ettercap cave on Veskals - This one is harder... They have tons of ettercaps around, youll need CC. And some adds that run all the way from the begining to the botton of the place always come on the worst time. You get the quests on some knights camp near veskals. The boss is hidden in a wall on the deep and drops some nice stuff... I think the name is Achtalans<br />
<br />
Fallen Lyceun - Fantastic questline. You get a redcap pet on this quest... useless but fun as ****... its nice to set them to fight each other with friends.. lol<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On Kojan:<br />
<br />
Rajins Stronghold - You gotta love the rooftop part where you jump around in kung-fu style. Some times you jump so high you can see the gobs in martok... lol j/k (lvl 7-10)<br />
<br />
Jalens Crossing - You get a quest that goes in some flying islands... SOOO nice up there. The way to the boss is jumping in a ventilation thing that shoots you waaaaaay up high in a tower... Lol.. I did that like 1000 times... Up there there is a Darth-Vader as the boss... (lvl 7 - 12)<br />
<br />
<br />
On Qalia<br />
<br />
Some Mine near Mekalia - You get a tinny animated armor pet. It only works once and inside the place, but its funny too... There is a HUGE collosus in there but it wont move... if anyone get some info on how to make him dance, pls tell me. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'll post more later as I remember...<br />
I'm now on kojan and Id like to know more fun places to go, doesnt metter the lvl, xp or itens.. its all about gaming with friends...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sublimatiion</div><div class="date">05-24-07, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hear Tomb of Lord Tsang or whatever has a nice questline that results in nice heroic weapons.  I think it's late teens early twenties.  <br />
<br />
CIS questline in Qalia is also worthwhile, albeit long.  End of line you can wear infineum armor and get a legendary weapon, and a heroic item.  Starting about 20+.  <br />
<br />
Dargun's Tomb is great exp (6-8k a kill on 34-38 4 dots).  It's a bit of a run there, located far NE in Thestra.  The named drop some nice soulbound loot, plus a questline that'll end in heroic items.  Named loot can be uncommon/rare/heroic.  34+, but 36 would be best.  Can't complete the questline until 37.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Additionally, on Kojan, there's the gardens, Gulgrethor Fortress, and Flower Palace.<br />
<br />

Gulgrethor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beldrynn</div><div class="date">07-19-07, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hunter's League Quest Some outside some in dungons<br />
<br />
1part <br />
Qa riverbank<br />
2 quest Uncommon items 10 to 14<br />
<br />
Zara..somthing oupost north of riverbank<br />
2 quest Uncommon as well 14 to 18<br />
<br />

3 quest (group) 3 Rare item 18 to 21<br />
<br />
then Slawla rock<br />
3 quest Heroic Item 2 armor 1 weapon 21 to 25<br />
<br />
this chain is long and quite hard if alone for the last to quest hub, first 2 are soloable <br />
get a whole armore set that fits( for some of us that like fitting gear) and a really good weapon. Gear is class specific<br />
<br />
the early items will maybe useless at lvl 25 but they are worthwhile as you lvl.</div></div><hr />
