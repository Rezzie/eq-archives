<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">08-05-03, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, that’s how our conversation started as I passed by Valar Project, Inc.’s booth at Gencon Indy where they were selling preview copies of their upcoming &quot;Book of Erotic Fantasy.&quot;  Really, it isn’t my kind, but the more I got to thinking about it, and the more I thought about the ever-so-cute booth babe who chatted with me (and whose picture I’m a complete dingus for not taking), the more I thought I ought to pick it up and take a look.  Part curiosity, part desire to help these folks get their book in stores (assuming stores want their book), I plunked down the ten bucks for it.  Yes, I actually paid for their advertising material.  I’ll send Aidden a bill.<br />

Gamer hell where all you do is play this with a bunch of sweaty, virgin 35 year olds in warm up pants and wife beaters!!!!! I think it's kind of funny, I think it's kind of sad, that the dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I've ever had.<br />

So you're saying people who like it will like it, and people who don't like it won't like it?   Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

So will have to say no, but most likely will be able to view when I have a account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">08-05-03, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, yes if you want to read any of the stuff on www.thesafehouse.org, you need an account (and Aidden is currently doing some tech mucky-muck, so the signup page is temporarily down).  There were other links within the article that went directly to valarproject's homepage, and those are blocked for people who don't have accounts there.  I sent of an email to them asking them if I could copy over the stuff that they had posted directly into the revew so that people could see the examples they posted without having to create accounts over there.</div></div><hr />
