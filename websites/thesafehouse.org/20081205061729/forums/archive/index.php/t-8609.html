<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DejaVuuDoo</div><div class="date">06-25-03, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night we tryed to killed him. For about an hour we were trying to get him pulled. Had a group of about 10 people or so. 2 rogues 1 warrior 2 clerics 1 sk 1 monk 1 chanter (all level 65) and a couple others, but we didn't have anybody with harmony there. And the chanter had trouble trying to land anything that so we could single pull him. We had pretty much everything clear except for the trainer chick, I think her name was Cyndi or something, and Anson of course. And i spawned Stanos after that. Anyways, we ended up leaveing due to frustration.<br />
<br />
I also found this post from another thread here. And I have read all the treads that are posted so far about stanos.<br />
<br />
Quote:did him easy with 5 a week or so ago.<br />
<br />
Someone please enlighten me.<br />
<br />
And another question, will harmony work on Anson, the trainer, and perhapse eveybody left there, makeing the pull a breeze?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">06-25-03, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for some reason, they still aggro with a bard using lull.  The best method that worked for me is to tag Stanos, drop off the cliff and fall down where the bandits are, and run back to Kith zone line where your group waits.   Zone out to clear aggro and have another person tag Stanos.  Just keep doing this til you get him to camp solo.  First time we killed him, I think our group was rogue rogue warrior cleric wizard, the next time we farmed his head we had a bard also.  With a bard or FD class, it should be easier to split him once they space out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any info on this would be greatly appreciated.<br />
Haven't tried him in a long time and want to.<br />

<br />
You can spawn him KoS.  What I did was clear the whole smuggler camp before spawning Anson, which is possible when Anson's PH is up.  It'd be a bit tougher once he's up since you'd probably aggro him while clearing the smugglers near him.  If the human chick is up, those mobs around her wouldn't be killable unless you try lull.  Just drop hide with sneak on and stay behind the smugglers, say the phrase to spawn him, then re hide.  You shouldn't get aggro if you're quick.<br />
<br />
Here's the log I posted a few months back.  We did 58k in melee damage.  2 rogues, 1 warrior, 1 cleric, and a 2boxed druid for DS and spot heals.  He has some insane resists so melee heavy is better.  My 100dd proc was landing for 20-30 when it did land.  On our other Stanos head farmings we brought some wizards and they were getting  numerous resists, even with lure spells.  Our elemental equipped warrior was using evasive and Stanos still did 320 dps which is probably one of the highest &quot;old world&quot; mob damage dealers.<br />

Cyra I think her name is ?  I swear everytime we pull him she and half the freaking zone show up to our party..<br />
<br />
Whats the trick with this ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">06-27-03, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">due to the new pathing, you'll bring a bunch of smugglers along with the NPCs in the tavern.  If you stay close to the Kith zone line, it shouldn't be a problem even though they sometimes end up pathing to the orcs then back to their spawn.  If you zone out and keep tagging, you can bring him single.  If you have enough, it's easier to just kill the human female, spawn Stanos and kill them there and off tank Anson</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anonymous</div><div class="date">10-01-03, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for bringing up an old post ... just out of curiousity, what other mobs have a melee output of 320ish DPS?  Trying to figure out if my group of contacts can handle him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Breakious</div><div class="date">10-04-03, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On my Stanos kill, we pulled Anson away from the smuggler area and had one guy just keep him there (Hailing i believe).  He would then spawn Stanos when we needed him. (Just saying the line)<br />
<br />
Once Stanos popped, our puller would just pull him, and pretty much 20 other mobs would follow out of nowhere.  As they all pathed back, the MA would just tag Stanos out of the pile, and he would come single most of the time.<br />
<br />
Got 4 heads that night.  <br />
<br />
Stanos himself isn't too tough, but dont take him for granted.  Ppl say hes about as tough as Vindi, but imma say hes a bit easier.</div></div><hr />
