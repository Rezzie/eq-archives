<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimmbull</div><div class="date">09-14-03, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like drinking.  I like drinking until I get that magical buzz that is one drink away from being a mess on the floor (and over the years have finally perfected getting there).  <br />
<br />
Drunks usually make me laugh.  In college I had the first model of mountain bike Shwinn ever made (solid, unbreakable thick, huge metal bike)- I used to keep it unchained over the weekends so the drunks could play with it outside my dorm....<br />
<br />
However, yesterday I had another brush with the worst kind of drunk- the Drunk-who-thinks-it's-cool-to-be-drunk (hereafter referred to as DWThICTBD).  I hate you DWThICTBD!!!   I hate the way that DWThICTBD needs to constantly, every MINUTE, remind us that he's drunk in creative ways that only he thinks are creative:  <br />
<br />
&quot;Usually I'm good with names but I'm so drunk I'm not that good&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hit me in the face I won't feel it- that's how drunk I am&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'm the drunkest person in this entire stadium&quot;  (setting:  yesterday's Wake Forest v. Purdue game- P.S.  GO BIG TEN)<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I shouldn't eat these nachos, they're not gonna look that great coming back up&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Listen......we all GET IT.  You've consumed a lot of alcoholic beverages.  YOU AREN'T SPECIAL.  ANYONE CAN DO THIS.  Literally- ANY @#%$ MAMMAL.  EVERYONE around you has been as drunk as you- MANY TIMES.  Shut your @#%$ mouth, go home, puke, and then DIE A DEATH THAT WILL LEAVE YOU BEREFT OF LIFE.<br />

P.S.  I HATE YOU DWThICTBD!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

But anyway, yea I don't enjoy being around drunk people because most people's personalities are exaggerated... atleast this is my experience.  I, myself, don't drink so I'm always the DD and a car full of drunks is amusing and sad at the same time.  Why must people be totally out of it to have fun.  Oh, and it's not fun cleaning puke off a down comforter</div></div><hr />

it's a tempory thing, which means it's effects last for a few hours, maybe the night, then it's the side effects (if any) and going back to the self that you (using the generic 'you' not pointing fingures at any one in this thread) may or may not loath....<br />

If we want to go down that slope, everyone should be overjoyous to sit in an empty, dark room alone with their thoughts. While that's quite pleasant at times, people do it because it is a part of the human existance here on planet earth in the realm of reality.<br />
<br />
Those who use it as a true escape (to avoid life, rather than relax from it) could use anything. Everquest, TV, a library, anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">09-19-03, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not mind other people enjoying alcohol even though I do not. I just don't get the following:<br />
<br />
Why do people who do very very stupid things when drunk continue to get drunk when they should know no good will come out of it? Not normal stupid like 'sleep with Ms Crotch Rot from a previous rant here' stupid but more like 'crash car into bystanders/become violent/destroy property that costs more than your monthly wages' stupid.<br />
<br />
Why are so many people under the impression that they are smarter, more charming and make a better impression when they're drunk? I've never met anyone who was more fun to be around when drunk. Generally being drunk seems to make most people really really annoying and unable to get the hint to @#%$ off.<br />
<br />
Why do people who do drink constantly feel the need to try to push drink on people who aren't drinking? I can go entire nights tolerating irritating drunk people who think they're a lot more clever than they really are without ever telling them they shouldn't be drinking. Yet they cannot go an entire night without trying to push some alcoholic drink on me at least 5 times in the duration of one night. I'd make up the excuse of telling them I'm on heavy antipsychotic medications to prevent those violent urges and therefor should not be drinking but these people seem unable to grasp the clue of &quot;@#%$ off @#%$ head!&quot; so I think anything more subtle has little chance of getting through. I even make a point out of not mocking them or mentioning anything truly embarrassing they've done while drunk unless they start trying to make me drink but even courtesy doesn't seem to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, those are good points and let me reply as someone who gets legless most nights.<br />
I agree with most you of what you said .. even drinking you have to be responsible. I think the difference is .. I know i am a pissed @#%$ when I am a ... well ... pissed @#%$. A lot of people never seem to learn that lesson.<br />
<br />
I never drive under the influence, never try to push drinks, and never think that being drunk is cool (that's a big one)<br />
I just like being drunk.</div></div><hr />

Your mind has limited capacity for excitement so doing some drugs or getting drunk makes you have a far better time then if you just sat around playing cards with your friends drinking soda. Now do the same activity and add some alcohol or other drugs and it becomes far more exciting, I will bet the house on it.</div></div><hr />

The real trick is to get people to push drinks on me, that's how you win the game.<br />
<br />
On a serious side note, sometimes you just get locked into a pattern of behavior because it seems like the easy thing to do.  Intellectually you know that eating 25 cent macaroni and cheese 5 nights a week because you've spent your entire paycheck getting blackout drunk is a bad thing.  Friday night rolls around though, and it's easier to get drunk that to tell the @#%$ you call friends that you might just want a hamburger next week.  I know this sounds like the &quot;I'm a victim of me environment rap&quot; and to an extent it is.  To stop self destructive behavior on your own is pretty close to impossible for most people, you need at least a few people who will support you in trying to change those patterns. - Nymm<br />

I rarely get black out drunk though I have every other day off and the whole weekend. Nothing else to do so me and my friends just buy some beer and chill and drink on the days I have no school the next day. I know my priorities though, if I got a big paper do or whatever I wont drink that night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">09-19-03, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hahaha, not likely Geidon. I just don't like the taste of alcohol, don't like it's effects and have on interest in using it. I'm quite happy without it and loud parties such as the drunken and drug-using people I know tend to prefer make my head hurt as I'm very sensitive to noises.<br />
<br />
Perhaps something is wrong with you that you need them to enjoy yourself more than without? No I don't believe that but if you're pulling out the traditional argument I'm pulling out the traditional counter-argument and then we can all bring on the traditional SH drug thread. I get pretty sick of drinkers pretending to know what's best for me, especially when I make an effort to accept their choices up to and including giving them bottles of something they like as presents. It's like @#%$ PETA people screaming how meat is murder, only in the morning it's all 'Yeah whatever, I was drunk you can't hold me responsible for trying to push my believes on you because of that'. At least the PETA people don't wuss with that argument out in the morning when their head is killing them.<br />
<br />
I also make a distinction between drinking and drinking within reason, people with the slight 'buzz' aren't too bad. It's when people get to the &quot;Well nothing else left to drink so we're gonna drink the disgusting cherry schnapps mixed in with this orange concentrate because we need something to drink&quot; stage that y'know, funny and witty is one thing these people are not. Slightly buzzed and drunk are not the same thing to me. One doesn't make people too bad in my experience, the other does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I enjoy alcohol in something that still somewhat resembles moderation.  Not everyone does and that too is just fine.  Still though, I, like many people, have a tendancy to socialize with people of similar interests and hobbies and the sober person in a drinking environment frankly is a constant irritation.  Heck, I had a completely non-drinking girlfriend once for a grand total of about six months.  She started me smoking again after a year and change without and I never did get her drinking.  That one was not one of my better relationships.<br />
<br />
People under the influence of alcohol (or drugs for that matter) bond better with others in a similar state.  In High School that is often expressed by the whole &quot;Maaannn, I am hammered!!&quot; sentiment unfortunately.  Later in life it tends to devolve into an urge to solve the world's problems spontaneously or (in the case of myself and my geekier friends) an unreasonable urge to yap frighteningly about tech subjects that would curl even my hair sober.<br />
