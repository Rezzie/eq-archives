<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maht Stohlit</div><div class="date">11-19-04, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have a site that shows which paintings look like what?  Or do they have different graphics?  About to claim my paintings and I really don't know which one to pick~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Montag McCleaud</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If any of the others are like the one I picked, (sunset over blackburrow) i think was the name, dont even concern yourself with it.  There is no detail to the paintings whatsoever and hardly any color either.<br />
<br />
The painting has 2 smudges on either side of a gorge which im guessing are trees with I think is a felled log in between.<br />
<br />
In no way does it resemble anything I remember of blackburrow.  And if it depicts a sunset im Fred Rogers</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maht Stohlit</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just picked one, forgot what it was called.  For my EQ1 heirloom I picked winged something or other expecting a dragon...but no.  Saw someone else who had a painting of what looked like Vox...kinda wanted that one~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farvel</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got The Slaying of the Gnoll. It's a blurry picture of 2 guards killing Fippy Darkpaw. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koryn</div><div class="date">11-21-04, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For my EQ1 painting, I chose the one with the phrase similar to 'Icy Death'...that gave me a picture of Lady Vox in her lair.<br />
<br />
For my EQ2 painting, I chose 'Empress..' somone or other.  That netted me a pic of a very hot (for pixels) and nude dryad chick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugannw</div><div class="date">11-22-04, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my eq1 was, something about the destruction of the Planes, I was thinking Planes of Power at the time, anyway, its not very good and I cant really tell what it is, kinda reminded me of the original Plane of Sky but I cant be sure, wouldnt recommend this one :)<br />
<br />
my eq2 was same as above poster, empress something, you can tell what that one is, though I didnt think she was nude, been to my apartment 0 times since I put that painting in, she does look scantily clad, not a bad choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koryn</div><div class="date">11-22-04, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">She's nude alright, but being a dryad, she has some well grown vines and bark that hide her in just the right spots :heart</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took Temple of the Elders as my EQ painting.  It is a painting of the entrance to VP.<br />
<br />
For my EQ2 one, took Tears of Cazic Thule, a painting with a waterfall in the background and one of the ziggarnauts (misspelled that, I think) the lizardmen always sat on outside of CT in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cregan Dhar'ken</div><div class="date">12-12-04, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I forget the exact wording on mine, but it was something like Blackburrow Bridge.  I expected a huge cavernous pit with gnolls and a stone bridge.  I got a log spanning a ravine with a hill in the background.  Way too pretty for my slummy apartment.  :beatup</div></div><hr />
