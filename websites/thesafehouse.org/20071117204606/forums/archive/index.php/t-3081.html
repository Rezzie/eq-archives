<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">06-24-03, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not sure how much you're looking to spend. but Noble Knight Games has a few used copies of the three core books for sale, each around $12-$15. check the RPGs list, and then look under TSR. <br />
<br />
if you have older gaming books to get rid of, you can also contact them about getting credit to help pay for the 3e stuff as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">06-25-03, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well depending on how broke you are, all the info in the core books are OGL, and you can download them in text format from the stickeyed thread in this forum.  That will get you the rules, but none of the flavor text (at least that's how I understand it).<br />
<br />
Or just stop by your local gaming store.  Wizards isn't offering a buyback for their current stock of books when the new editions come out, and they're gonna want to unload those thigns cheap.  They'll prolly take whatever you offer for them, because it's better than zero.<br />
<br />
Then, if you want to 'upgrade' to 3.5, wizards is going to be releasing the core rule upgrades on the web for free (again without any flavor or pictures), so you can fill in the differences as you wish.  From what I've seen, some of the changes in 3.5 are pretty worthwhile, so it may be worth the effort.</div></div><hr />
