<br />
I just wanted to know if i had all the facts straight.  That new pvp server that should be coming out in 2 weeks or so...their are no rules.  a lvl 60 and kill a lvl 1 and vice versa*yah right*.  You can snare a kiting druid blah blah blah.  All the old bannable stuff is gone.  So..is it start from scratch characters or importing your characters from other pvp servers.  Just wanting to know becuase me and buddies were gonna make some dark elfs and wreak havoc on the zones   so beware.  Just wanting to know if anyone has any other info. Or what the point is :0</div></div><hr />

You lose exp if you're PK'd.  Some people think it'll be great, others think that it will be full of all the grief players who once played on the other servers which would make those servers great, while making the new server i living hell.  I'm kinda leaning heavily twards the later myself. <br />
