<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">10-07-02, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got my make poison skill up to 245 using Stanos (from 154-on) and those unused 80+ training points.  But now my apply poison skill is pretty icky, probably rather close to 0.   <br />
<br />
Any suggestions on a fast way to raise it?  I'd rather not pay the 3 AA points for the skill, because there's still so much other stuff I need to buy.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't even put a point into it, then do that first, but otherwise, make the cheapest poison you can and just sit and apply it. Your skill will go up no matter what the poison.<br />

Spider poisons I'd just make and apply, without using (weaken never seemed to make the mobs hit any softer), and the snake poisons I'd use when fighting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, that should read:<br />
<br />
Hmmmm. right-click. you have successfully applied, kiss 5-10pp good bye, right-click, you have successfully applied, kiss 5-10pp good bye, right-click. naww. something seems to be missing here. <br />
<br />
10 times later, you have gotten better in apply! And 50-100pp poorer.<br />
<br />
Apply after 100 skill virtually never fails. Not saying it can't. Just saying at 100 skill vs. 200 skill you won't see much difference if any, so don't go blow 1kpp to raise it. Just use it as you go and it will raise just fine on its own. Patofnaud  (raid gear)<br />

Make the cheapest one possible and do it to 100. Seriously, after 100 you will seldom if ever see a fail. I haven't in ages.</div></div><hr />

5-10pp?  what the heck are you using that stuff for?  Grave Mold farms free and easily and costs less than 1p to make, unless you buy the skins to make the vials.<br />

<br />
Spider Sacs : 0.525 pp ea from vendors<br />
Regular Vial : 1.625 pp ea from vendors<br />
Regular Suspension : 0.625 ea from vendors<br />
<br />
Only about 3.3 pp per try, and you can knock it down to around 2.5 if you make your own vials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cool 3.3pp per try or 2.5pp if you kill a zombie, and head to a wheel/kiln vs. my 5pp-10pp. Thanks for callin me to the carpet on that one. Whew!    <br />
<br />
Ya missin the point I was trying to make lad.. <br />
<br />
Don't just sit there and burn off your wares, just carry them around and USE them. Apply will go up just fine on its own. If your using ONE TYPE of poisons, then thats 4 Inventory slots to make 20 shots of Snake Venom. Don't just burn em all to get a skill point, USE em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">10-21-02, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, poisons look so great I think I'll save up 3 points for the poison skill and never fail to apply it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">10-22-02, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd use every snake poison I made.  <br />
<br />
Spider poison seemed pretty worthless though.  It never seemed like the mobs were hitting any less hard or often due to the strength drain, so I'd just apply, then apply over it.<br />
<br />
And time IS money, I agree.  I haven't made anything less than sealed vials since I was skilling up pottery.<br />
<br />
Not worth the time/effort to save a measly 8 gp, but making sealed vials saves closer to 3 pp, and I dont seem to be living under the money tree like some folks.</div></div><hr />

Poisons were completely revamped in PoP!! Although the older poisons did not change, the new poisons are more of a potion than a poison. Right clicking on a poison has a 6 second apply time, and will equip any attack with a 10-15 minute proc effect. Since these are more like potions than poisons, there is no more check for the Apply Poison skill! You will never fail to put on your poison again.<br />

I hadn't failed a poison app in like 400+ tries the last time I raised my apply skill, so its not like mastery was a night and day difference in failure/success anyway.<br />
<br />
And no, you dont have to sit anymore but you do have to stand (you are basically casting a spell now, like Myro armor) Edited by: Jasek Evil at: 10/26/02 11:06:44 am</div></div><hr />
