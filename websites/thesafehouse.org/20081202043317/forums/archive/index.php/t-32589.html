I recently joined a good guild and hoped to use the only other rogue as a mentor but he doesn't play any more so, nowhere to turn but here!  :frown <br />
<br />
How in the @#$% do I equip throwing daggers?  I bought some level one daggers this weekend and tried them both in my ammo slot and ranged slots.  Nada.  No error message, nothing.  What am I missing?  I've always used a bow but that isn't very roguish so I thought I'd switch. Shouldn't I have a throwing icon in my abilities book? I have one for &quot;ranged&quot; that shows a bow but resetting that and dragging it back to my hotbar didn't work.  Dragging the icon from my inventory didn't work.  Oh and my level is pretty high hehe, so that can't be hurting me.<br />

Are you using a custom UI?<br />
<br />
edit: also, throwing daggers are based on throwing skill, not level. Make sure your throwing skill is high enough to use the throwing daggers you bought.</div></div><hr />

No custom UI.  Daggers are level 1.  I made that mistake the first time and went back to a ranged weapon vendor and bought the lowest ones I could find.  Maybe I'm bugged?  <br />

<br />
Yes, it's stupid, but it's how it works.  Click the ranged icon with the daggers in yer ranged slot (and ammo slot, actually, it'll drain both then turn to your bags).</div></div><hr />
