As the Master of the Callidus, stealing is not mine nor my apprentices primary means of gaining funds, we much prefer paid killings, but there is never enough work for a subtle blade in Norrath.<br />
While wondering the East Commonlands, just recovering from my recent trip to Neriak, I saw a Teir'Dal Necromancer far richer than his seasons would suggest.<br />
As I was bored, has just spent the last two days in his foul City, and my blade was still in the chest I stored it in before I had gone to Neriak, I decided that I would do what rogues are famous for.<br />
STEALING.<br />
Alais, I was painfully reminded that the laws of order and discord prevent us fom stealing off fellow adventurers.<br />
Therefore I turned to the teachings of the Callidus. Mighty assasins we may be, but there those that we cannot kill. In those situations the next best thing is producing the illusion of death.<br />
A evil leader cannot lead if his followers believe him to be dead. Therefore I hoped to be able to create the illusion of stealing, to anger this Teir'Dal, and perhaps foll him into beliving that rogues can really steal.<br />
Therefore, sneaking, behind him, I moved my hand towards his pocket. I then, using the slight mental abilities we all have (OOC Emotes), I gave him the following thought:<br />
Cyriex has stolen from YOUR inventory.<br />
Cyriex has taken 3 gold from YOU.<br />
<br />
You should have seen his face. He not only got angry, but truely believed I had stolen from him. He even threatend to contact the gods in response.<br />
Content with my new skill, I snuck off to a near by group discussing vaious trades. I gave them the same mental image, and the result was nothing short of astonishing.<br />
5 brave adventureres fell hook, line and sinker<br />
As I id not wish to give rogues a bad name, I returned to teaching my  Apprentice Tadyen in the subtle sides of combat.<br />
I hope this knowlege I hve shared will aid the work you  do<br />

You should see there faces when they think your after them. A dream is only a dream until it is real. Then it is a nightmare.</div></div><hr />

What I noticed is that everyone I tried it on actually believed it. They ran like hell or threatend to report me.<br />
<br />
But I finally got rid off that sorry ass necro gnome beggar, he was trying over and over again to trade cloth armor for my Dragoon Dirk. What a morron.<br />

<br />
I had just left the bank in Rivervale with some silver in my inventory, planning to visit the dock and buy some buckets of bait to go fishing. (On this server, it is not wise to go walking around with a lot of money on you, least you end up lining some PKers pocket.)<br />
<br />
There were a lot of characters hanging out, so I decided to practice an emote:<br />
<br />
/em deftly picked your pocket and stole some loot<br />
<br />
There was a big clamor, with everyone shouting that I was a pickpocket, and even crys of &quot;Kill him!&quot;  I really thought they were going to.<br />
<br />
I backed up against the wall and they surrounded me.<br />
<br />
/em begins to cast a spell<br />
/em 's spell fizzles!<br />
<br />
(Somehow, my Rogue spells always fizzle.)<br />
<br />
Then a Guhnome wizzard said, &quot;Relax folks, he's just a joker.  It's impossible to pickpocket a PC. Get outta here, Rogue!&quot;<br />
<br />
I thanked him and headed for the dock, but a Halfling Druid followed me.  (She was about Level 4, and I was a lofty Level 6, dreaming of the day when I really got pickpocket.)<br />
<br />
She got right in front of me and says, &quot;Give it back!  RIGHT NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, I gave her my buckets of bait silver, and my profuse apologies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't EVER do it AGAIN!&quot; she says, and ran away.<br />
<br />
(And right now, stratospheric level Rogues are thinking, &quot;It's because of people like this jerk that we can't get in a group.&quot;  I'm sorry.  I won't hardly ever do it again very much too often, but I'm learning how to be a Rogue by reading the stories you guys write.  Thank you.)<br />
<br />
Sudden thought:  Is it possible the little Druid out-Rogued me?<br />
