One minor thing though, the table doesn't have a section where jewels are dropped.  If this could be added, the table will be complete!<br />

They are a random drop of of mobs that I am guessing are LVL 38 and above.<br />
<br />
I have not see any pattern to the drops (ie jewel type 1 of of mob type a). Basically it is a rare drop.<br />
<br />
Rare in my case seems to be about 1 jewel per 80-100 kills if my parser is correct.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Generally the zones are not populated enough to get into a pick-up group you you are either left to bring your own group, or bring a char that is high enough to solo them to get the items.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pattern I noticed with rares are that you have to kill the wanderers.<br />
<br />
I hunted the mobs behind the waterfall,  never saw a rare pop there. Also, , never saw a rare pop at the static points like the bowl by the waterfall.<br />
<br />
The best success I had in getting rares was to hunt anything that wandered around near the waterfall area. Seems that most mobs eventually path up there.<br />

<br />
My Paladin wouldn't find  all of the pieces useful because there isn't any +Sta &amp;amp; +Dex on them.  I've always been a firm believer in &quot;mix and match&quot; for optimum equipment.<br />
<br />
My Cleric wouldn't find  all of the pieces useful because the Ro Bracers are flat-out better (unless she needs the minor resists), she was gifted with some Donal's Vambs, and she has high enough Smithing that she can make some attempts at High Elven Cultural Plate.<br />
<br />
For  non-twinked characters in thier upper-30's to even upper 40's, this is very nice stuff.  Sure, a full suit isn't the best because of the lack of variety of stats... but it's certainly pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ziann</div><div class="date">01-13-02, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you think an upper 30th level character can do these quests that just proves your ignorance<br />
<br />
i went back a page or two and saw where you were asking if these quests are viable for a 42 paladin.  let me explain why its not in your best interest.<br />
<br />
in the time it would take for you to gather the components for 1 piece that you would &quot;mix and match&quot; and actually use you would be able to level a few times.  not only that but if you chose good places to level you would be able to earn enough cash to purchase 2-3 pieces or armor better than these quests rewards, in e.c.<br />
<br />
this is true due to 2 things: the rarity of the specific components you need when youre after 1 piece, and the difficulty of the placeholders and droppers at that level.<br />
<br />
take my word for it, these quests are very non-rewarding for the effort it takes to complete them.<br />
<br />
this stuff is basically &quot;farmour&quot; so save those druid, bard, and ranger pieces if you actually want any of it. Edited by: Ziann  at: 1/13/02 7:03:02 pm</div></div><hr />

Thank you so much for posting that info. I was thinking about the wanderers next, but this cuts hours off my time<br />
<br />
of trying Random things.<br />
<br />
Also for the poster that recommended simply hunting elsewhere for cash and exp, <br />
<br />
if you dont belong to a high end guild or are tired of poorly<br />
<br />
planned camps,<br />
<br />
this zone does provide good exp for most (even my 51 guy<br />
gets decent exp here in the Twilight Oasis when grouped of course with a healer) and cash is nice but not uber 2-4pp per mob isnt bad.<br />
<br />
I guess i just like questing for stuff and is a nice break from the routine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah for example I got a jewel for a quest item (forgot which one.. astral?) off of a grol baku sentinel in scarlet desert. That is just a regular grol baku mob, not a named one. Other light blue grol baku or tro jeg or whatever rares and other light blue con rares in the zone do drop quest items though (light blue to a 55)<br />
<br />
Ah found it now looking in my notes, and what I saw in a post by rizen88 from earlier in the thread:<br />
<br />
[Sun Dec 16 02:09:12 2001] sun jewel, grol baku sentinel, scarlet desert<br />

 Found sun jewel of zelniak dinosaur lookin thing in dawnshroud peaks, only killed a couple that agrod on me so not sure if it is rare or not. Great table btw.&quot;<br />

So as you see they can come from any of these zones probably off various things. Edited by: aandaie  at: 1/14/02 1:19:36 am</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming it has to be from the twilight area you swim through a tunnel to get to since that is where the vas ren guy was and the times are close together. I just now came here and saw the prospector one was not found i guess.<br />

! Found another in my notes that is different than here. Though I see it also drops from a thing in mons letalis in the chart, mark of silence:<br />

<br />
I have to admit as a 56 Druid I am disappointed.<br />
<br />
These pieces are not going to be used by me in a single place as posted.<br />
<br />
Granted I'm above the target level.  But I firmlly believe the effort involved, is more approriate to me.  The sheer amount of kills to get the named to spawn, makes this difficult.  The agro range, and level.  And I just dont see a lot of under 50's doing these.<br />
<br />
Even If I didnt use them.  The disappointment is that some pieces are so BAD that they wouldnt have been usuable at level 30.<br />
<br />
I had bought RMB by 30.  And they are superior with the 5 Wis to the bracer.  Same with belt.  Crystalline Belt is superior to Druid Belt.  <br />
<br />
Some pieces would have been a slight upgrade to my 30 EQ.  Legs are a slight upgrade to Gatorscale.  But worse than my Military Leggings.  <br />
<br />
Cloak would have been a slight upgrade to Mammoth/Molten.  But I'm a tailor.<br />

Yeah I meant visible armor screenshots, like of me wearing it.  I guess I should have included sword in that list since thats visible.  I havent finished belt, neck, mask, sword, arms, or boots.  I'm 1 piece away from all those though but camping the last parts for them has been anything but enjoyable.  I still need Star Ruby Studded Medal for boots, I have the mark of Poetry which I traded for, unfortunately the person didn't remember what dropped the Mark (still unknown). Also short Seared Brand for Girdle, Mark of Psalms for Gorget, Mark of Tenor for Mask, Moonstone Medal for Sword, and Mark of Entertainment for Arms.  Most are Twlight Sea drops which no one is ever clearing on my server.  If I do finish those I'll be sure to post, would be nice to complete arms, boots, and sword to get a full suit view I guess.</div></div><hr />

Where is the sambata primalist that drops it found in Dawnshroud?  Is it a rare spawn at the tribal guys, or does the rockhopper cave need to be cleared out to spawn sambatas?  If it's the latter then this part really sucks, tailors are always here looking for rockhopper hides and get really pissed off if someone despawns the rockhoppers.</div></div><hr />

Once he dies all rockhoppers despawn shortly afterwards then the sambata start to come. Then to switch it back to rockhoppers you need to kill some named sambata butI cannot confirm who this one is. The Age Old Rockhopper is a beefy, unmezzable grey colored version of the normal rockhopper.<br />

<br />
Anyone who belongs to a mid-sized Guild, even with only 6-12 people in their upper 30's, should have little difficulty doing these quests.<br />
Sure... for my Paladin doing these quests  solo, it's pretty much pointless.  However, the game is Ever Quest, ne?<br />
I get to play two to three times a week for two to four hours a time.  I  despise the boring LoIO/OT/DL loop that so many people seem stuck on and will never do that again.<br />
If I were able to play even at better hours (I usually don't get to play until late in the evening, PST), I would easily be able to get friends to come along on these quests.<br />
<br />
I do agree that the rarity of the spawns pretty-much means that you have to have a Tracker... and that sort of thing really does stink... but overall I'm happy with the items.<br />
Heck, if I just had a level ~40 Druid/Shaman to hunt with me I'm sure it wouldn't take nearly so long for us to complete a few (most likely random) quests.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for some actual data...  <br />

I say this as DE Shadowknights are KOS to all three Katta Factions, and the faction that the ShadowKnight Questgivers are on is Katta Castellum Citizens - which is unraisable by kills (and thus unraisable to an already KOS player).<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm which faction the SK questgivers are on in the Twilight Sea?<br />

Yes, more than likely the case.  I do the &quot;unknown&quot; list from my spreadsheet since i can just sort by location in excel and it neatly shows me which ones have no location/mob drop.  This also makes the &quot;unknown&quot; list current to when i post it, independent of Keltarin's updates of the web-based database.<br />
<br />
I'll do some digging, I've only killed the minnow once and it didnt have that mark i think so im pretty sure i got that info from this thread somewhere.<br />

Fought both within 15 minutes of each other and the minnows were both spawned at the same time and in the same area.<br />

Yes, I have one. Definitely drops there. I believe he spawned in the 2nd main room of them, though he may have been a roamer. I don't recall for sure and was clearing the whole place with AE.</div></div><hr />

Take a look at the monk wrist wraps(leather class) vs the bard bracer. The beastlord tunic vs the bard bp is a better example though. The tunic is 1 ac different for beastlord. The bard one is 21. Where is the balance in that? Sure the PoG beastlord tunic has some more hps/mana and a very SLIGHT difference in other stats. But 21 ac compared to 1 ac? Even worse, do the comparison when the warrior bp is done. Hell, the ranger is a chain class and his quest bp from twilight if I recall is 17 ac. Where is the balance here? And for the person saying who wants to see a lv6 bard running around in that? I have seen too many newbie twink bards with ss bp/greaves with equipment on I still wear at 60. Only difference between my gear and theirs is my SSS. My point here is I don't want to see more twink bards, I just want to see balance in the rewards.</div></div><hr />

It is a matter that in all silk and leather so far, the item exceeds the old class quest armors and compares 1 to 1 with the old planar armor. The beastlord armor compares to what they can get by going to Plane of Growth, without the effect on the BP.  <br />
<br />
Now, compare the plate armor. 22ac for the warrior quest bp vs 35ac on the Indicolite BP. Difference of 13ac, and if I am not mistaken the old crafted BP was 22ac. Where is the upgrade there? you get nada for putting in as much effort as the other classes in the new Luclin quests. I for one intend to show Verant how biased these quests are.  It seems in the long run all the armors out there that can improve a warriors AC can be worn by other classes as well. And if other classes can  get the same AC, better damaging weapons, spells, etc, where is our balance? What are warriors supposed to be there for when others AC can absorb damage just as well as we can? and will our alternative advancement points help us in the long run to balnce some of this back out?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Angelsyn</div><div class="date">01-21-02, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree...<br />
<br />
The only problem is, when you're talking only a few points of difference in AC (for example, Bracer of Ro is 9 AC... TSQ Bracer is 10 AC... Valorium Bracer is 10 AC) then it's difficult to make something &quot;better&quot; without being &quot;alot better&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think you should also look at the Monk gear coming out of these quests, incredible AC on these things, compared to the Ranger/Rogue gear... which sometimes has worse AC than Ivy Etched/Ravenscale!<br />
<br />
I personally think that this armour should have been positioned, AC-wise, directly between Hate/Fear and Crafted/Ro/Whatever.<br />
<br />
For Paladins (since that's my main) and ShadowKnights this would give the following:<br />
Head: 14 AC, Chest: 25 AC, Feet: 14 AC, Hands: 11 AC, Legs: 14 AC, Arms: 13 AC, Wrists: 10 AC.<br />
<br />
For Warriors this would give:<br />
Head: 16 AC, Chest: 28 AC, Feet: 16 AC, Hands: 14 AC, Legs: 16 AC, Arms: 15 AC, Wrists: 11 AC.<br />
<br />
For Rangers/Rogues/Shamen, the Chestpiece should be 22 AC, and the Monk/Beastlord/Druid Chestpiece would be fine at 14 AC.<br />
<br />
The main problems with these armours (besides how tough camping all these rare named spawns is without a tracker...) seems to be...<br />
1) Not balanced across the classes...  Warrior armour  should be slightly better AC than Paladin/ShadowKnight armour, yet indications are that they will have the same AC.<br />
2) Not balanced across the suits themselves...  Some of the pieces for each class are fantastic, while others are twink-gear at best.<br />
3) Not balanced compared to other equipment.  Taken on a pure AC basis, the Warrior gear is hardly much of an upgrade from Crafted... Ry'Gorr blows away many of the pieces for Rangers &amp;amp; Rogues.<br />
4) Not balanced for time/effort to obtain.  This one we might as well forget about.  &quot;Risk vs. Reward&quot; has  never included the length of time spent doing something.  One only has to look at Tradeskills to see that.<br />
<br />
Will I still do these quests?  Sure... but then, I'm a nutbar who also likes doing Tradeskills and working on quests that really have little to do with the class I'm playing.</div></div><hr />

You have said it in a way that I apparently could not. It is not a matter of how the classes work, but how they cheated the plate and chain classes in comparison to the other classes. I could kill guards in Katta and get as good or better armor than I am getting running around questing for them.  Monks and Beastlords are the ones making out well on this armor, unless the weight bites on it.</div></div><hr />

On a serious note I don;t know if the maintenance on the Luclin zones is responsible or not, but I saw PLENTY of quest mobs in SD and --surprisingly-- Mons letalis. Here's to the hope the upped the spawn frequency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No Ro Armour<br />
No Kunark Armour (other than crescent - which has no right click effects and worse AC than Wu's - and clearly isn't mean't to be the same line as cobalt/ES etc)<br />
Planar Armour that has worse AC than Wu's<br />
PoG, Skyshrine, Thurgardin Armour is worse AC wise than lower guk and velks drops that are sold for knack all, I wouldn't wear any of it, other than to keep BP, Legs in a pack for buffs..<br />
<br />
Kael Armour was the first quest armour we got that is actually decent, and for many smaller guilds its not obtainable.<br />
<br />
There was a significant need for a bridge between Wu's and Kael - and it looks like we finally got it, for some pieces at least.. The bracers and legs are actually nice.<br />

<br />
However, I am not inclined to be sympathetic given that ranger's have plenty of other armour easily available that is better anyway and on top of that, its about time other classes had to put up with a set of terrible class specific armour - until now Monk's had a monopoly on it =P<br />
<br />
These quests are harder to complete than getting Thorny Vine pieces and some Tolan's Darkwood pieces, and they both crap all over the monk luclin stuff for AC.  Hell Ivy Etched has the same AC as the monk luclin stuff and that is lowbie armour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm trying to understand where you're coming from...<br />
<br />
Tossing the Ranger armour out of the equation, how about comparing the Monk Twilight Quest armour to the Paladin/ShadowKnight Twilight Quest armour.<br />
<br />
Now, you can't tell me that a level 35 Monk in full Wu's armour won't have nearly the same AC as a level 35 Paladin in full Ro.  Taking that a step further, do you believe that a level 45 Paladin in full Twilight Quest armour will have nearly the same AC as a level 45 Monk in full Twilight Quest armour?  I think not.  I believe that the Monk will have a clear advantage in AC... and is that the way it should be?<br />
<br />
A Level 50 Monk in Thurgadin Quest armour will have similar AC to a Level 50 Paladin in Thurgadin Quest armour... at least according to the numbers I've seen.<br />
<br />
So tell me again why Monks should have such an advantage in this set of quest armours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just jumped in this thread to the last page, so I havn't read the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Thurgadin monk armor:<br />
<br />
Tunic: 16 ac<br />
Bracer: 6 ac<br />
Legs: 6 ac<br />
Arms: 7 ac<br />
Gloves: 10 ac (We use our 15 ac epic instead.)<br />
Boots: 7 ac<br />
Helm: 5(?) ac<br />
<br />
The bracer summons shurikens, the legs have a stamina buff. Other than that, monks either don't wear the armor or have equal/MUCH better armor from a non quest source.<br />
<br />
<br />
Azure sleeves are almost equal to thurg<br />
Kromrif military legs are equal to thurg<br />
Barbed dragon scale and shiverback boots destroy thurg<br />
Monk epic &gt; thurg gloves<br />
Fungi tunic &gt; thurg tunic<br />
Any helm in the game &gt; thurg helm<br />
Symbol of loyalty to vox is equal to a thurg bracer, not counting the effect.<br />
<br />
Gray flesh sleeves &gt; kael<br />
Oiled greaves &gt; skyshrine<br />
Barbed dragonscale boots &gt; kael<br />
Fungi tunic = Kael<br />
<br />
<br />
All of those items are cheaper and easier to get than the quest armor as well.<br />
<br />
Monk only armor has a history of sucking. Can we please have armor we're proud to wear for once?</div></div><hr />

Maybe you're forgetting the AC bonus Monks have.  Besides, I didn't ask if the Thurgadin Quest armour was any good, I said you'd end up with the same final AC as a Paladin in Thurgadin Quest armour.<br />
<br />
Which means that with your &quot;non-quest source&quot; armour, you'd have a better AC than a same-level Paladin.<br />
<br />
Quote: Monk only armor has a history of sucking. Can we please have armor we're proud to wear for once?<br />
<br />
If you go back a page or two, you'll see that I am  not saying that the Twilight Quest armour for Monks be reduced/nerfed...  I'm saying that most of the other class' armours should be increased to a not-quite-Planar (old world Planar, btw) level.<br />
That way a Level 40 Paladin in Twilight Quest armour will have a comparable AC to a Level 40 Monk in Twilight Quest armour... as opposed to the situation as it appears now, where the Monk's AC will blow away the Paladin's AC.</div></div><hr />

Yes I followed it up with a sarky comment about other classes deserving a crap set of quest armour, but the initial point was still made.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, there is absolutely no point implementing quest armour if noone is going to bother questing it, and therefore it has to be = or &gt; than the armour a class will be wearing at a particular level. So if its for level 40, yes it should be &gt; ivy etched for rangers and &amp;lt; planar/tolans.  And for monks it should be &gt; wu's and less than erm? what?<br />
<br />
A typical lev 40 untwinked monk could be wearing  CCS + Azure Sleeves + Froggie Crown + 2 vox bracers + gatorscale legs + netted kelp shoes + silvery mask + ulthork neck + wu's cloak.<br />
<br />
Therefore the luclin armour should be better than some of these pieces if it is going to be worn. The legs and bracers at least fulfil that.  The rest doesn't.  And the less than planar argument doesn't hold for monks, since most lev 25 monks have better armour than monk planar, with the exception of the shivercrap shoes maybe.<br />
<br />
You can call me a whinger if you like, but I'll continue whinging that it is unfair that monks don't get a full set of class specific armour that is actually desirable for level until they are 55+ (and in a big guild.)<br />

Can anyone tell me which Coterie camp this guy spawns at?  I have noticed with the Coterie that diffrent named ones seem to only spawn at certain camps.  At the camp nearest Katta, I have seen a Coterie Guard, Duelist, and several others.  But when I hunt at diffrent camps I find diffrent named ones.  At the camp next to Grimling i have seen a Coterie Fighter a few times, but none of the others.  When commpared with info on other people's post, this matches up.  It would seem that they only pop in specific places.  Also I have noticed that they do seem to spawn in duplicates.  I'll get 2 or 3 of the same spawn, then it will move to the next.  This isn't always the case, but others have observed this behavior of the mobs at the Coterie, and in other zones as well.  Again, please post where the Coterie Combatant spawns if you know, I would really appreciate the help   <br />

Has anyone even bothered saying thanks?  I see a lot of suggestions and criticism, but no thanks for compiling the information.  Hmmmm... I would like to say THANKS!  I used your charts, EQDruids Charts, Allahkhazam's Quest info, a few other websites, and a lot of my own information as well as a great Druid's tracking ability to locate all the NPC's for LOC's to cross check to make sure everything was accurate.  We have tossed it all up on Our Guild's website.     Again... THANKS for all the GREAT INFO!<br />

<br />
2) Herrick... with your &quot;sample Monk gear&quot; at level 40, what AC can you expect that Monk to have?  850?  900 perhaps?<br />
My Paladin at level 42, fully self-buffed and having a few items that are technically beyond her level, can barely reach 850 AC.  Looking at the projected numbers for a full suit of Twilight Sea armour, I'd probably end up with the same number.<br />
Now, I admittedly don't know alot about Monks... but are you telling me that a level 40 Monk in a full suit of the same quest-level armour should blow away my Paladin's self-buffed AC?<br />
<br />
Yeah, sure Shiverback armour is &quot;garbage&quot;... but I'd love to see what the AC of a Level 50 Monk in  only the Shiverback pieces is compared to the AC of a Level 50 Paladin in  only the Valorium pieces.<br />
I'm betting that the Monk would still have a slightly higher AC.</div></div><hr />

But luckily, I got one today from someone who was killing Coterie in a different camp than me.  The Coterie Combatant spawned in the camp labeled 2 on the map at EQ Atlas.  I have seen pieces for the Druid, Bard, Wizard, and Enchanter bp/robes come from named Coterie at camp 1.  Have also spent a good deal of time at camp 5, but the only named Coterie I have seen spawn here was the  Coterie Fighter, who drops the piece for Cleric legs I believe.  Have yet to try killing at camp 3 as it is a very difficult place to solo for me.  Hope this helps anyone else looking for these items off of Coterie.  <br />
   Now, I just need one more item and I will have completed the Necromancer robe.  Need to kill the Grol Baku Jewler in TS.  As i understand it there is several places to find Grol Baku in TS and i would much rather kill the ones on the islands rather than hunt in that secret area, which for me is extremely laggy!  Should you happen to know the location of where the Grol Baku Jeweler can be found, please post here, again i would really appreciate any help.  <br />
  Oh and thank you to everyone who has contributed to this board, we have all done a lot of work and with out everyone's help this would be much harder.  <br />

I doubt very much that a pre Kunark level 50 monk could get to 1100AC, even with PoA and planar god drops.<br />
<br />
If I was wearing full shiver I would be &amp;lt; 900, in full luclin I still wouldn't make my current AC level.  A cleric in full hate armour has greater AC than a monk in full shiver. Please understand that you cannot compare the monk luclin stats to other classes luclin armours based on previous armour set comparisons. <br />
<br />
It appears that verant have finally realised that the AC on monk class specific armour sets was previously appalling, and have at least created one set of armour that is appropriate, its just a shame they won't go back and lift the shiverback AC to a more appropriate level.<br />
<br />
Our luclin armour is now &gt; Sol Ro (or Dalnir level if you will since we don't get sol ro.)  and &amp;lt; kael, and so is yours, quit whining, you have more hitpoints than us anyway!<br />

The Warrior armour isn't really any better than Crafted (AC-wise anyway), the Paladin/ShadowKnight stuff is only better by a very small amount &amp;amp; the Ranger/Rogue/(&amp;amp; probably Shaman) stuff is lower AC.<br />
<br />
I'd still like to know why, just because you feel the Monk armour is good you won't admit that the Plate &amp;amp; Chain armours need to be upgraded.<br />
<br />
P.S. My Paladin probably doesn't have more HPs than you did at 42... she's a Half-elf with only 107 Sta, after all.</div></div><hr />

I've been camping this in Ten Mts for nearly 2 weeks and nothing. I've got about 16 named on the ETs but no mediator. No one ive spoken to has ever even seen such a mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Axemaster2001</div><div class="date">01-30-02, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main difference with this quest armor, and the old world quest armor, seems to be that the designers have listened to the players, and accepted that players want gear aimed to their class. The AC may be the same, but the stats are much better. Soldier gear for example is AC, Str, Dex, Sta (more HP) and HP (great) with some minor saves. I made a list to show the Crafted armor vs TS armor. Crafted has rather silly stats like +5 Cha and +5 Int on warrior items. On top of that, Full sets of armor are available, not just 5 or so items. I have a feeling a full suit of TS armor is gonna be rather nice for mid-levels. The BP is better than most things i can afford for my halfling warrior (who cant wear Treeweave).<br />
<br />
If I get a chance Ill post up the total Vs. stats of the two, would be interesting to see other such comparisons.<br />
<br />
Dont compare Thurg etc as that stuff is No Drop. We are talking armor that mid levels can get. This stuff looks like its also to encourage player communication with trading of the items....<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />

Herrick<br />
<br />
PS I am not going to continue the argument about monk armour, its pointless =D. I agree that the AC on a lot of other class pieces is somewhat sucky, and that relatively the monk bracer and legs are nice (read: wearable) The other monk pieces pretty much suck as badly as the other class luclin armours.  <br />
<br />
EDIT: Revenant camps may not be so easy, the reavers / revenants have very high FR  (Even with ro's fiery sundering on, I was still getting full resists 50% of the time), and were even / yellow at 44.  Easy for a high melee group, sucky for casters, and lotsa hp too.  More interesting than sitting in DL tho)<br />

Considering that the MoB you are looking for is supposed to drop a  Mark of Meditation, I think the MoBs name has been miss-spelled by the original poster, and that he missed one &quot;t&quot; in the name.<br />
<br />
In other words, look for a  Grol Baku Meditator, instead of a Mediator.</div></div><hr />

=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
 The wolves are semi-common in the northern half of the zone and a little more so toward the western corner. While exp'ing there we saw 6-8 named Zelniaks, and 3-4 named wolves in a 6 hour mad pull fest. One Astral jewel dropped in all that time, off a wolf iirc.<br />
 Later I saw another 2 Astral's drop off of the Trap wolves over at the Maidens zone area, and 2 more from 'shrooms someone trained to the zone. Never seen a non-Astral jewel drop in DS, but that could just be luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They drop off any of the placeholder type mobs of sufficient level (maybe around 35 or more) in the zones that drop the twilight sea quest stuff. That would be various wolves, grol bakus, light crawlers etc.<br />
<br />
Like I got a jewel off a grol baku sentinel of the same level of a camp I was camping for quest or other drops in scarlet desert, light blue con to a 55. Someone else got the same jewel in another zone off something else, its random.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vas Ren:  Around the perimeter of the oasis are several static pops of protectors and shamans, these seem to be the ph's for the quest droppers.<br />
<br />
Grol Baku:  Along the northern wall is an area with wandering grol baku, all of the named that I've seen have been right in this area.<br />
<br />
Bloodtribe:  In the quadrant north and west from the northern tip of the oasis.  Was grouped there with a bard and she pulled several bloodtribe to that location from the northwest.<br />
<br />
Tro Jeg:  Never seen one on the plateau, but seen them wandering in an east-west band from the rev camps by TS to the northernmost of the rev camps on the far wall.<br />
<br />
Revenants:  Seem to be pops at the various rev camps, and from a very limited sample size certain ones seem to pop only at certain camps.  Seen the sun wraith only near the TS zone, while the sun rev hero popped several times at the big camp on the west wall.<br />
<br />
Sunflowers and cheetahs:  Had the most luck camped at the north tip of the oasis grouped with a tracker.  Killed every normal mob we could find and after a bit named started to appear.  Also found a named cheetah along the west wall between the rev camps.<br />
<br />
Rockhoppers:  Camped out at the ramp up the plateau and killed hoppers, got several named this way.<br />
<br />
Lightcrawelers:  Still unknown, no luck finding named as yet.</div></div><hr />

Especially in terms of +Attributes +Resists and at least relatively what value the AC will be.  Using this information I have estimated what each piece should look like, there will undoubtedly be exceptions and I had to make rough guesses on some of the AC which is less predictable.  Neverless this chart should be pretty accurate, so far the pattern holds almost exactly with only a couple of exceptions that I have included in the NOTES column.<br />

<br />
Morel Champignon, check page 19, the message above the final one on that page. Thank you  <br />
<br />
Four hitpoint schemes:<br />

C - 20 HPs<br />
D - 25 HPs<br />
<br />

B - 5 HP / 3 Mana<br />
C - 10 HP / 5 Mana<br />
D - 20 HP / 10 Mana<br />

Casters (Wis + Int)<br />
A - 2 HP / 5 Mana<br />
B - 3 HP / 5 Mana<br />
C - 5 HP / 10 Mana<br />
D - 10 HP / 20 Mana<br />
<br />
Besides that, there are three different +skill schemes:<br />
<br />
E - +3 prim, +3 sec, +1 ter<br />
F - +4 prim, +3 sec, +1 ter<br />
G - +8 prim, +5 sec, +3 ter<br />
<br />
Neck: A E, SvP 1<br />
Face: A E, SvM 1<br />
Head: (A or B) E, SvM 1<br />
Chest: D G, SvF 2, SvC 2, SvM 2<br />
Shoulders: A E, SvM 1<br />
Back: B F, SvF 1, SvC 1<br />
Arms: B F, SvF 1<br />
Wrist: A E, SvF 1<br />
Hands: B E, SvD 1<br />
Waist: A E, SvD 1, SvP 1<br />
Legs: C F, SvC 1<br />
Feet: B E, SvC 1<br />
Weapon: D G, SvD 3, SvP 3<br />
<br />
That being said, your list does contain a few errors.<br />
<br />
Beastlord Boots: they have 5 HP / 3 Mana, not 3 HP / 3 Mana<br />
Beastlord Gloves: they have 5 HP / 3 Mana, not 5 HP / 1 Mana<br />
<br />
As such, all the 3 HP items should have 5 HP as estimate for the Beastlords.<br />
<br />
(By the way, the above to errors seem to be a mistake on Keltarin's side, in his table ...)<br />
<br />
Also, your HP / Mana scheme seems a bit inconsistent for Head pieces. Sometimes you give 2/5 (or 5/2) and at others you give 3/5 (or 5/3). The problem here lies in the fact that no Head piece has yet been reported for a mana using class.<br />
<br />
Bracers are a bit wacky too, but that is because Verant probably made an error with the Cleric Bracers, for which they used HP/Mana scheme B and not A. The other three known Bracers with Mana to them all three use HP/Mana scheme A. You estimate Beastlords to use B as well, but on all the others you estimate scheme A?<br />
<br />
Shaman Spear is of course also a 1H piercer and the Warrior weapon is a sword (probably a 2H weapon, but not sure).</div></div><hr />

I thought I saw that a while ago but couldn't find it when I went back to look for it.  I also figured it would be of some value to list all the estimated items rather than the formulas for folks' convenience.<br />
<br />
I wondered about those Beastlord values, and figured that they could have put in a special set for BL, if the reported pieces match everything else then the estimates should probably be in line also (5 HP 2 or 3 Mana).<br />
<br />
For some reason I got it in my head that Healers got 5/3 on the helm and Int Casters got 5/2, which <br />
I suppose is possible, as you said none of those pieces have been found but no other pieces are like that so until then I'll make them all 5/3.<br />
<br />
Interesting about those Paladin Pauldrons, I'll mark that in my notes as one of the Exceptions, sometimes it seems that the players are more dilligent about checking these values than Verant. ;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I was just playing the Devil's Advocate a bit there    - people have made sloppy typo's before on items. Heck, I am not free from that either; I just notice an inconsistency and ask people to verify those.<br />
<br />
But sometimes it really is the way it is, and not any different. Verant just screwed up then. The Bard Breastplate was erronous before they changed it, the Cleric Bracers are off as well (1 mana too much on them), and apparently the Paladin Pauldrons are flawed a bit as well. The latter two are &quot;positive&quot; flaws, however.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the Warrior sword that has just been reported. If the report is correct, Verant messed up again. All weapons so far had SvD and SvP +3, while this one suddenly has SvD, SvP and SvM +2. Or the report is incorrect. But unless the person verifies the weapon, we won't know.<br />

<br />
Yes.......the Jewels  (i.e. Star Jewel, Moon Jewel, etc....) drop randomly off of any mob in a quest zone.  They can drop off of named variants or the regular mobs.  The luclin Twilight quests seem to be centered around the following zones: Dawnshroud Peaks, Tenebrous Mtns, Twilight Sea, Mons Letalis, Scarlet Desert........so any mob in those zones CAN drop a jewel.  I wouldn't waste your time trying to get a jewel to drop in Grim Forest, Paludal, Neth Lair...as those ARE NOT &quot;quest zones&quot; for the twilight armor.<br />
<br />
What I have found is that the Jewels seem to be the rarest drops because of the randomness of the mobs that can carry them....also, each jewel is LORE so even if your class matrix says you need....3 Star Jewels spread over 3 armor pieces, you CANNOT get them all at once.<br />
<br />
What I would recommend is this:<br />
<br />
1) Get a tracker and hunt down the named variant mobs.  There drops are guarantee'd.<br />
2) During down time of NO NAMED spawns...and just for exp sake...hunt the normal mobs...because well, they are PH's for and spawn the named versions anyway.  During your time hunting you will inevitably get a jewel or two.<br />
<br />
p.s. By named variant I mean this........<br />
<br />
For example...in tenebrous mtns....the basics mobs would be a darkwing bat, Grol Baku Soldier...coterie Legonairre.  Their NAMED VARIANTS would be something along the lines of  &quot;a nasty darkwing bat&quot;, &quot;Grol Baku Engraver&quot;, &quot;Coterie Cohort&quot;<br />
<br />
.......sorry if I was a bit too informative.......I don't mean to assume you don't already know this.....I just try and answer any forseeable question you may have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Angelsyn</div><div class="date">02-25-02, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I do agree that the risk/reward is a bit skewed on these quests for most classes, one has to admit:<br />
<br />
1) The Monk &amp;amp; Beastlord stuff is pretty good.<br />
2) The Plate &amp;amp; Chain class armours should be increased in AC... but should still be below old-Planar levels.<br />
3) The Cleric stuff, even at current AC, is very nice.  Especially for Erudite &amp;amp; High Elf (low Str) Clerics.<br />
4) It's boggling that every piece has +Dex... except for the Shaman gear. (Why +Cha for them?)  Maybe if instead of Dex (Cha) they had bonuses to differing stats it would be better. (i.e. some give +Dex, or +Agl, or +Sta.  Some variation would be nice.)<br />
<br />
If, for example, the mobs in the Twilight Sea &quot;hidden area&quot; were  all on par with the various quest mobs in Dawnshroud Peaks (not counting the hoppers, I understand even the named are tough.) then it wouldn't be so bad.<br />
<br />
I took a Level 40 Ranger with me (Level 39 Cleric) to the &quot;hidden area&quot;.  Despite our ability to easily handle even Blood Starved Wolves in Dawnshroud... the rediculous lag (turning clip-pane down made it near-impossible to see even close mobs), combined with the sheer power (I think they were hitting for about 50% more damage at least) of the mobs made it impossible for us to hunt there.<br />
<br />
I can only imagine that the mobs in Mons Letalis are as bad, if not worse.</div></div><hr />
