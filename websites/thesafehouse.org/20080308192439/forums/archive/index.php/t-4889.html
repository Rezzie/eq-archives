In order to use these charged items, you must have first dragged the magical item's icon to your quick bar. Then, to fire it, press the use item key, and then within 1 second, press the quick bar number of the item. Please note that there is currently no way to use the mouse to use these items. <br />
<br />
<br />
if that doesn't work, try right clicking on it.  also, it might be a proc instead of a clickable effect. Dither Disgustipated<br />

Is not a &quot;self only buff&quot; item  that's a Proc and it's mis-stated on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magikal effect&quot;<br />
Target: Self  = Proc that is not fully completed like many other things, same thing as the &quot;lusterous Forest Viper Fang&quot;  Self target proc=does nothing currently.</div></div><hr />
