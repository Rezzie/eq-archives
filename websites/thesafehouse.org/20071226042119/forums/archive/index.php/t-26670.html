<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">11-05-06, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in the eroge scene, it's quite a landmark. As far as I know, it's the first massive eroge project to have been completed successfuly. There have been a bunch of smaller projects, but none on Tsukihime's scale.<br />
<br />
Air is also pending release, and technically was completed before Tsukihime, but due to the stupidity of people, the patch is not released yet.<br />
<br />
This news really doesn't help many people, as very few people actually have Tsukihime. If you didn't get the original Tsukihime, the only other chance to get the game was a $500 Limited Ed release.<br />
<br />
However, despite all things, it still is a very wonderful thing in the community, and hopefully will begin to turn the times to become more accepting of what games such as Tsukihime are about. There are a lot of negative misconceptions, the biggest being that they are just porn games. <br />
<br />
But they are better described as visual novels. <br />
<br />
Tsukihime is the story of Tohno Shiki, a boy who can see the lines of death, and Arcuied, a Vampire Princess who lived 800 years solely to hunt vampires. There's a big mystery in this game, you play it from different paths which makes you &quot;end up&quot; with certain girls, in a different sort of way. It's not like a dating simulator.<br />
<br />
With this release, I must bow my head and cry for poor Satsuki-chan once again!<br />
<br />
EDIT: I thought I should emphasize there's no way to buy a physical copy of Tsukihime without spending a minimum of $300 on ebay.</div></div><hr />

I used kinda think this way but after playing Ever 17 (I know its not in the same vain as Tsukihime or eroge) I had a whole new respect for visual novels. Ever 17 had a really GREAT story. The thing about the visual novel is how it all tied together and the char development involved.</div></div><hr />
