<br />
Holy 3 = KimiNozo + Grave of the Fireflies + Gunslinger Girl + watching them all at once = Suicide/Major Depression</div></div><hr />

Well, dropping the cash for the box set of that POS was pretty depressing, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-12-06, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mushishi, while heartwarming at times, is often very heartwrenching. Fullmetal Alchemist is also often very depressing. One REALLY sad show is Koi Kaze, very few shows have ever put me through such emotional turmoil. Haibane Renemi, Voices of a Distant Star, The Place Promised In Our Early Days, Binchou-tan, and Saikano all come to mind.<br />
<br />
Yomigaeru Sora -Rescue Wings- made me cry. It was one of the most incredible anime I've seen. Too bad nobody takes notice of it.<br />
<br />
Kino's Journey (Kino no Tabi, Kino's Travels, take your pick) is great. Air is recent, and sad, but I think you already saw it. Full Moon wo Sagashite is another tearjerker. Now and Then, Here and There is brutal. Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal are powerful. Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari (Requiem from the Darkness) is horrific and depressing.<br />
<br />
Le Portrait de Petit Cossette is another favorite. Symbolic, depressing, and brutal. Perfect Blue is a psychological thriller that will get you really ****** up. Jin-Roh The Wolf Brigade is disturbing.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm telling you to go kill yourself. Farewell! :p</div></div><hr />

I found Kanon really sad, too (not really sad overall, but still a teary-eyed anime). Air was a depressing one (although maybe it was more cause I didn't understand it :p), too.</div></div><hr />
