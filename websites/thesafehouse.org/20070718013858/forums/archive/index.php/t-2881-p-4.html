<br />
first you need to exclude the jewels, cuz they can drop in any zone it seems, so that leaves marks and misc. <br />
<br />
i have only arranged 4 classes but there seems to be a very close pattern<br />
<br />
for bard pieces are located in (zone - # of pieces found in zone)<br />
<br />
tenebrous - 4<br />
twilight - 9<br />
mons letalis - 4<br />
scarlet - 9<br />
dawnshroud - 5<br />
<br />
for shadow knight<br />
<br />
tenebrous - 5<br />
twilight - 9<br />
mons letalis - 4<br />
scarlet - 9<br />
dawnshroud - 5 <br />
(one hasn't been discovered though, but from the pattern i would guess its in mons letalis)<br />
<br />
and the last one i'll show is beastlord<br />
<br />
tenebrous - 5<br />
twilight - 9<br />
mons letalis - 5<br />
scarlet - 9<br />
dawnshroud - 5<br />
<br />
you see the pattern i hope, so if you are a class missing a piece still i would try to follow this pattern, and any zone that is deviating from the 5:9:5:9:5 pattern, i would check there first, in areas taht other pieces are found in , such as the spire spirits for the sk mark of twisted souls, since that is missing a piece it seems and no other sk pieces come from the spire spirits<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mugglewump</div><div class="date">03-05-02, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple things:<br />
<br />
First, the main chart shows indicates that the 'var ren waterlord' is found in Twilight Sea with a little question mark next to it.  He is in fact found in The Scarlet Desert, as I came across him last night in my travels.  He was wandering around at the southern end of the zone -- near the grol baku camp in the center of the southern wall.<br />
<br />
Trying to get a specific tro jeg, grol baku, vas ren to spawn in Scarlet is an extremely time consuming process.  I have been attempting to get a Bespectaled (sic) Grol Baku to spawn there for well over a month...I have leveled twice (from 51 to my current 53) almost exclusively from killing Grol Baku.  While I have gotten plenty of TA drops mobs and others, I have never come across the one I want.<br />
<br />
So, to the person asking about killing a few Tro Jeg to get his special to spawn -- it will likely take A LOT more than a few..you might get lucky, or you might want to plan to move in up there.<br />

<br />
My friends and I killed so many sunflowers, lightcrawlers, aliens, and sun revenants/reavers to the East and North of the plateau believing that might be the right area.  Turns out it wasn't.  However, on the East side of the plateau there is a rare named lightcrawler that spawns called Sectoid.  He drops at least 3 very interesting items.<br />
<br />
1) Melee bracer, chain and plate classes as I recall.  AC 12, +2 to most stats.<br />
<br />
2) Silken Trance Cord (waist item).  wt. 0, Int and Wis casters only (I think), +3 int/wis, +6 MR, plus stats.<br />
<br />
3) Ring, AC4, +6 agi/dex<br />
<br />
So it wasn't a complete waste of time.  Got 2 bracers, 1 ring, and one belt.  First Sectoid dropped the bracer and ring, second Sectoid dropped the bracer and belt.  Needless to say, my pally and wizzy are happy.  Now if only I could get Glorious Sunflower to pop so my brother's bard and I can leave Scarlet Desert.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Angelsyn</div><div class="date">03-05-02, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you want to leave the Scarlet Desert (assuming you're getting xp there)?  The Sun Revenants drop some pretty incredible gear... there's an AC 15 Bracer that drops... a few nice Range slot items...<br />
<br />
It's incredible.  It's as if Verant decided &quot;Well, if people are going serious about doing the Twilight Sea Armour Quests, we'll throw in some extra rewards...&quot; and then someone added &quot;But only in one zone, okay?&quot;</div></div><hr />

It honestly should not be hard to get people, even those who aren't interested in the Quests, to come there.<br />
<br />
Also, I've found that hunting one specific mob is often a bothersome waste of time...  Hunt a variety of things and get pieces for other quests to trade (or even do the other quests and trade/sell the results).<br />
<br />
Besides,  way too many pieces drop there.  Only the &quot;Hidden Area&quot; of Twilight Sea has more pieces... and that place is **** to hunt in, due to the lag.</div></div><hr />

To create a table in ezboard, you need to do 2 things.  First, you need to make sure all your html is on ONE line (no line breaks).  Otherwise you'll get about a million blank lines before your table.<br />
<br />
Second, you need to put your table between<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sirap Pancake</div><div class="date">03-06-02, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a question I would like to pose.<br />
<br />
For the static (non-wandering) named mobs that drop quest pieces, will they always spawn in the same, *unique* spot?<br />
<br />
For example, in the hopper cave in Dawnshroud I have seen almost all of the named rockhoppers and some more than once.  I have always seen the same name in the same spot and never any other named in that spot, which leads me to believe that above statement is true.<br />
<br />
However, someone mentioned in this thread that three different named thought horrors could spawn in the same spot, which obviously rejects the above statement.<br />
<br />
I'm seeking the Dusty Spire Spirit spiecifically, and so far I have found a named for every spot on the ground floor minus one (that spot being the one directly under the staircase).  Should I keep clearing out the floor or camp that one spot to continue my search?<br />
<br />
Any comments would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_petercorbin</div><div class="date">03-06-02, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what he meant was since there is only 7 static thought leech spawns (not counting greater, hes different) and 4 wandering ones (not sure if the wandering bugs can be replaced by wandering leeches or not but i've always seen 4 wandering leeches, 3 that make a circle of the main camp and 1 in the entry cave)<br />
but since theres like 15 named leeches and only 7 static spawns (and 11 total..) they gotta share.   My theory is each static spawn has 2 guys, and the lore guy is one of the wanderers.  I have seen the same ones spawn at the same spots more than 2x... same thing with other static spots like in dawnshroud in the rockhopper/sambata caves.. the cunning rockhopper always spawns to the right of the elder rockhopper.. and the sambata veiled guide spawns right there too when theyre up.. and so on and so on.. but unfortunately most of these guys arent static spawns <br />
<br />
I've done some research here.. you figure almost all the species in a zone will have 15 different quest guys, one for each class (ya theres some exceptions, but over all this is the rounded out method)  for example, there will be 15 rockhoppers, 15 bugs, 15 stonegrabbers, 15 thought leeches, and 15 spire spirits in Mons letalis.... <br />
<br />
then in scarlet you have grol baku, vas ren, tro jeg, sun revenants, bloodtribes, lightcrawlers, sunflowers, cheetahs, and rockhoppers.. 15 of each<br />
<br />
twilight sea you have cral ligi, turtles, scavanger minnow, grol baku, vas ren, beetles, shadows (i think theres more than 15 of each on some of these not sure i havent finished the other zone lists other than scarlet, my home on the moon)<br />
<br />
dawnshroud you got stonegrabbers, rockhoppers, sambatas, wolves and zelniaks, about 15 of each<br />
<br />
tenebrous you got coterie, bats, meeda hune, grol baku, and cral ligi.. about 15 of each.<br />
<br />
Yea each zone has a couple of exceptions, dawnshroud has the golden mushroom, tenebrous has the light sonic wolf, twilight has a tro jeg, etc... but this is why you see that 5:5:9:5:9 pattern for the classes because basically theres on average one type of mob per class per zone.<br />
<br />
And just because one sees a vas ren waterlord in scarlet doesnt mean that there isnt one in twilight sea.. there are a few mobs that share names in different zones, like grol baku seer (although scarlet version is a mob for a different quest and doesnt have faction or loot), and several others like rockhoppers you'll see 2 or 3 different zones w/the same named mob that always drops something different in their respective zones.<br />
<br />
Scarlet desert is the best zone in the game !    I love it.. tons of rare mobs, tons of really nice loots, areas where theres higher level stuff that only drops loot and not the twilight sea stuff.. you can get tailoring pelts here (although not as often as i'd like) but the drops are amazing.. book of the magistrate, bracer of defense, chancellors medal, dull sunflower webbing, earring of command, edifiers leggings, faith healers gloves, mask of antagonism, paragons orb, prophets robe, sectoid scale bracer, sun chalice, fiery ring, sandles of something, sunlords leggings, talisman of disbelief, wand of the sun, wand of flame, wet thorn cloak, worn brass ring, writ of the bloodtribe ancients, and like 50+ more items Plus like 130+ twilight sea quest mobs.. i love it i love it i love it.. my mains almost 59 now and i got most of last level or two off stuff in scarlet.. and every character i get to the 30s + is gunna level up in scarlet.. hmm maybe i should shut up before everyone comes out there</div></div><hr />

I am interested to start on the quest, but it seems I won't be able to solo the quest alone since apparently most of the mobs that drop quest items are 40+ and travels in groups.<br />

I've found that there are very few Quest mobs that I could not duo with my level 39 Cleric and (Random level 40+ Tank).<br />
<br />
The Coterie and the Shadows are tough due to their lifetaps... casters are a real advantage here.<br />
Tro Jeg have a nasty fire proc, but I can time my heals very well now.<br />
Twilight Sea's &quot;Hidden Area&quot; is just a pain because of the lag issues.<br />

To spawn the sambata firekeeper you will need to venture deep into the rockhopper cavern and kill the rare rockhopper spawn.  Then you have to deal with the sambatas who hits for 125.  Personally I'd just use the time to have more fun fighting something else I prefer while leveling and use money to buy a better robe.<br />
<br />
Sure, if you have a group that can help that would be possible then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kaysha Soulsinger</div><div class="date">03-08-02, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to expand on the ideas posted several posts up by Peter Corbin. In it, he says there is the 5-5-9-5-9 pattern, which might apply to all classes. I actually think there are 3 such schemes:<br />
<br />
(Dawnshroud - Mons Letalis - Scarlet Desert - Tenebrous Mountains - Twilight Sea)<br />
I: 5-5-9-5-9<br />
II: 5-5-9-7-7<br />
III: 5-5-11-5-7<br />
<br />
If you observe the 15 different classes, you can roughly assign five classes to each of these three schemes.<br />
<br />
I: BRD, BST, SHD, SHM, WIZ<br />
II: MAG, CLR, DRU, ENC, NEC<br />
III: RNG, WAR, MNK, PAL, ROG<br />
<br />
Of these, at least BRD, BST, MAG, RNG and WAR are matching completely. There are some anomalies in the others:<br />
<br />
SHD: Missing one Mob. Probably found in Mons Letalis.<br />
SHM: Missing one Mob. In addition, there is one Mob too many listed for Scarlet Desert. Mobs are missing from Dawnshroud Peaks and Twilight Sea. Could also be made to match III, if there's a Mob too much in Twilight, and Mobs missing from both Dawnshroud and Scarlet Desert.<br />
WIZ: At least five Mobs missing, assuming the requirements for the pants are completely wrong (error by Verant). Adding these in different ways could make WIZ fit with I, II and III.<br />
CLR: Missing one Mob. In addition, there is one Mob too many listed for Scarlet Desert. Mobs missing from Dawnshroud Peaks and Mons Letalis.<br />
DRU: One Mob too many in Mons Letalis, one missing in Tenebrous Mountains<br />
ENC: Could be in I and II (see WIZ), but missing two Mobs in any case. If in I, missing one Mob in Twilight while having one too many in Tenebrous. If in II, missing one Mob in Tenebrous while having one too many in Twilight. In both cases, two Mobs missing from Dawnshroud.<br />
NEC: Missing one Mob. Also, One Mob too many in Dawnshroud Peaks. Missing Mobs in Mons Letalis and Scarlet Desert.<br />
MNK: One Mob too many in Mons Letalis, one too little in Tenebrous.<br />
PAL: One Mob unknown, probably in Scarlet Desert.<br />
ROG: One Mob too many from Twilight Sea, one missing from Scarlet Desert if it belongs to III. If it belongs to I, it has one too many Mobs in Scarlet and one too little in Twilight Sea.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that the reported information is wrong; after all, Verant is not known to be 100 percent consistent in these things at all, as has been proven before. However, it seems interesting enough to see how each class can be fitted to one of the three schemes by taking only one Mob as being at an incorrect zone. Either these hint at hidden 'inconsistencies', Verant side, or they are errors in the listings so far.<br />
<br />
  IF the above is indeed true, then there are currently 7 incorrectly reported Mobs on the list, along with 12 missing ones. I think this has some plausibility. Edited by: Kaysha Soulsinger  at: 3/8/02 7:16:40 am</div></div><hr />

It's not much, something I just threw togeather.  But it is searchable with no annoying pop ups / unders.  I still need to crosslink stuff so you can look up say a Rogue mask and click on the mark it needs to see where it drops etc.  Needs some graphic work too, but it's a start.<br />

Also- got a bespectacled grol baku today (im on stormhammer) i dont know if the guy looking for him got him yet but for me he was standing at Positive 1716, negative 176.. <br />
<br />
Also yesterday i killed 'a fiery sunflower' and he dropped 'fiery sand' but i dont see that on the mob or the item lists.. maybe this is the 'fire powder' needed for warrior sword and the person that posted it got the name wrong and said 'fiery sun revenant' instead of 'fiery sunflower' which would be an easy mistake to make, esp when you get like 10 of these guys in a day.<br />

I just have a question to see if you all think this works the same way.<br />
While fighting in Tene mntns, I got almost every item for the twilight quests, as the strange named are real easy to see on tracking there as there are fewer mobs and types of mobs than in scarlet. I noticed in this time that every time I killed a named another would pop, leaving about 3 up at all times. 2 of which I went after as they were soldiers, bats, wolves. The only ones I didnt do were coterie and therefore dont know that cycle. <br />
My question is this..While killing in Scarlet I cant tell whether or not another named pops after I kill one. Does this happen here as well like it does in Tene? Or are regular sunflowers PH's for the Glorious? In Tenebrous, the regulaar mobs were NOT PH's for named, and only killing a named caused a different one to spawn. I have read a couple things about the bottom of the ramp here so I am gonna clear the odd names in that area and see what happens. ATM there is a dark rockhopper and a cursed sun revenant on track. Rockhopper I will do Rev is tougher. <br />
I will post results.<br />

<br />
I've hunted in the hidden grotto in Twilight sea for hours. I've killed at least 300 common spawns. I have killed 29 different rares in there, not including duplicates. Yet to see the cral ligi painter (last item needed for SK BP). Have also seen a couple loot dropping rares in the hidden area also. All rares but one were roamers. The one that was standing at a tent was a loot dropper.<br />
<br />
I have three corrections to make on the table:<br />
<br />
Grol Baku Ancient, drops Broken Ancient Blade for Ranger Belt, spawns in Twilight Sea, not Scarlet Desert as the table says. I've killed the GB Ancient twice now.<br />
<br />
Also, table says an enraged sun revenant drops the Mark of Rage, for me it was &quot;a raging sun revenant&quot;, in Scarlet Desert.<br />
<br />
And lastly, King's Tome, for SK Greaves, was dropped by &quot;cral ligi lorekeeper&quot; not loremaster.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also today got the fiery sun revenant and he dropped the fire powder.. so the fiery sand from the fiery sunflower is an unlisted drop.. i'm assuming its for one of the wizard quests that got messed up as to what the guy says he needs..<br />
<br />
had a good morning got another 8 pieces from scarlet and some loots )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kippen123</div><div class="date">03-21-02, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wrote a post to Dev corner about how this armor's stats are rather low considering the time/effort taked to get and possibly trade for these items. I don't know about other servers, but in my server I would say that there are less then 5% of the people here that are bothering to work on this stuff. Partner that with the fact that these mobs are not soloable til at least 45 and I still have a few I cant do easily at 52 and you will see that the armor's stats are too low. They will prob respond : &quot;well groups in their 30's should have no prob getting these drops&quot;, and I disagree. I can't imagine getting a group together to camp 1 twilight armor quest item. Its so much into most folks brains to hack and slash for items, and I am one who thinks questing is the best part of this game and therefore solo a lot.<br />
I urge you all to post on the Sony EQ Developers board, your feelings about this, and maybe we can get them to up the stats on these items so it is more level with the time/effort taken to get them.<br />
I for 1 have been chasing 1 item for almost 3 months now, and I am gonna just buy the better BP I saw as the stats are better, but I would still like to finish these quests as they are fun.<br />

<br />
With the advent of the chat channels, specialized chats are popping up everywhere and attempts are being made to utilize a standard naming convention (auction, tradeskills, etc)  from server to server.<br />
<br />
I would like to suggest we start a channel as well. <br />
<br />
How about  /twilightarmor ?<br />
<br />
/twilight would work, but there may be a guild called Twilight (fill-in-the-blank) who may be using that shortened form.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_bspanther</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have taken a different tatic to working on these armor quests.  You guys might have better luck at getting other items, but the chances of me (a druid), even getting to roll on Kael or ToV armor drops (it will always go to monks, etc, rightfully so IMO), is very slim.  These quests I can work on solo, or with a small guild grouping (there are a few others that want a piece or 2).  Granted, I don't want a full set, just a few pieces that are better thanwhat I have.  But I don't camp a single spawn I need.  .. I get them all.  What I don't use will go in the guild bank or to friends.  They do the same thing if they get druid drops.  Sure, it is taking a while, but I am getting good exp while I do it for the most part (started early this week at level 47, now 2 blues from 50, doing wuest mobs almost exclusively.)  The quests are doable at lower levels with a group.  Yes, might be tough to GET a group there, but that is where those connections come in   <br />
<br />
Also, I think the idea of a chat channel is great.  It will definitely make trading items alot easier! Edited by: bspanther  at: 3/22/02 10:52:23 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
was doing spires cave today and got my arse handed to me by a stonegrabber that wandered in..  thought leeches and stonegrabbers in mons letalis are ***WAY TOO FRAKING HARD*** verant change this!~  mons is a joke.. rare claws off stone grabbers, and 3 hard loot dropping mobs (one whos immune to slow) and the quest guys and thats about it... Mons Undercon is a better name for the zone.  Scarlet desert has 47+ mobs that drop loot, some of it just mind boggling stat wise for the level of stuff and the Sun Lord W guy is the only one that has given me a true run of my money in terms of difficulty.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kaimana MM</div><div class="date">03-26-02, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not that the spawn is broken, I don't think, it's that the rockhopper cave needs to be cleared and a certain rockhopper killed in order for the Sambatas to spawn.  I know on MithMarr people farm the hoppers for pelts and usually don't want to spawn the Sambatas.<br />
<br />
But saying that, I'm not saying it's  not broken.  Always a chance for that kookiness in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dudly BardBoy</div><div class="date">03-26-02, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An Age Old Rockhopper is the Sambata switch. And he is no joke. Was blue at 58, proced a blind, immune to snare/changes in run speed, hit for 120+. I had to train him to the sambatas near Maidens.It Killed like 10+ sambatas at once and was still after more.<br />
<br />
He drops a BL/monk claw, or a 2h staff. Once he is killed, ALL he rockhopper poof even if you were fighting them, and a minute later Sambatas spawn in the cave. The sambata spawn is kinda buggy, at times i could see 30+ on tracking, some 5 strong in a single spawn spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Wulfgyr Dracokyn</div><div class="date">03-26-02, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as Mons Letalis goes on Quellious....<br />
<br />
It's broke.  Been broke since thursday, near as I can tell.<br />
<br />
Petitioned today, Senior Guide accidently let slip it was broke, and said file a bug report.  F that!  I just wasted 1 1/2 damn weeks runnin' all over that damn place lookin' fer a dude that's broke.  Wish I had the cash to buy sumthin' decent, but I'm broke!  /rude Verant<br />
<br />
BTW, the above applies to at least the Horror of Lore spawn, the 2 Really tough &quot;mini-bosses&quot; in back (Thought Horror leader dude, and Corrupted Hivemistress), and prolly a number of the other &quot;named&quot; horrors req'd fer the Twilight sea quest.  Only seen one since Thursday, after he went down, haven't seen anymore.  <br />
<br />
Soooo.... anyone got a clue if that damn scavenger minnow has a chance of droppin' the Writ of Safid?  Or got one they'd sell on Quellious, or trade fer a pile of other quest pieces?<br />
<br />
Edit:  I think it's fixed now; finally got the Horror of Lore last Friday; it appears to be a VERY rare spawn, even worse than the &quot;normal&quot; Twilight monsters.  Prolly made deliberately rare, as a &quot;chokepoint&quot; for the Shammy BP (which is very nice, if you don't have the cash fer an emerald dragonscale, etc).<br />

<br />
A moment of fame!  (or should that be infamy)<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway.. yeah. Been auctioning for it FOREVER. I've never actually been able to hunt due to A) people desperate to pharm the hopper hides B) the bugged spawns where tons of sambata pop at a single point and C) the fact this guy evidenty spawns WAAAY down inside and I get aggros even though I con dubious to them.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think they should move all the quest tribal mobs to the Sambata spawns over by ME and leave the hoppers up 24/7. I actually did a /bug with this suggestion. No other quest pieces fall victim to this triggered spawn scenario.<br />
<br />
IMHO, I also think they need to up the frequency of the overall quest mobs in ALL the zones.  Those damn alien factions are a PITA as well. I went scowling KOS with the grol baku after trying for two weeks to get my mob to spawn and am STILL that way after killing enough tro jegs to go from tro jeg apprehensive to tro jeg scowling KOS.</div></div><hr />

Enter the cave, come to a big room, head left, come to another big room.  In this second big room, there will be four spawns and the spawn that is off by itself is the Horror of Lore.<br />
<br />
Bring a friend or three....<br />
<br />
Looking for the spawn spot of the Dusty Spire Spirit if anyone knows it.<br />
<br />
Also, does anyone know the spawn location of the Tro Jeg Dragon in Scarlet Desert?  Is it a stationary spawn up on the plateau or a wanderer down below?<br />
<br />
P.S.  I have a buttload of these quest items for trade on Tarew Marr. Looking for the following: Fresh Spring Water, Mark of Dragon, Mark of Defense, Mark of Unity, Mark of Discipline, Jar of Ointment, Oiled Scales, Golden Gem, Scorched Idol, Sharpened Rockhopper Claws, Embedded Gravel Tablet, Spire Spirit Dust, Mark of Peace, Great Gem, Oblong Clay Bowl.<br />

sorry i didnt get a loc but it was about 1/2 way between the big higher level bloodtribe cavern and the plateau.. i could see the plateau in front of me when i spotted him.<br />

  he wasnt on my list of scarlet rares i was just killing him because i didnt recall seeing one before and i dont xref the other zone lists since in some zones a common mob has the same name as a rare in another zone.. i.e. grol baku seer in twilight vs. scarlet</div></div><hr />

I've created a Word 2000 version of the above info, indexed solely on the alphabetical name of the item - marks, misc., whatever, it's all in a straight alphabetical easy to printout list.

Anyone wants it drop an email address here and I'll send it along - or if ya want to host it that's fine - whatever.  If it'd be some use to you reply    I found that item name is the easiest index field for random crap you loot in the middle of a hunt.<br />

<br />
Few tips on the sheet: <br />
<br />
1) i usually note the # of items i have in the stock fields then i go to the quest page and put that item in italics. this makes it a ton easier when you want to see how close to finishing each item you are.<br />
<br />
2) Use the Data - Sort feature to make browsing the items easier and use CTRL + F to do a find on the page when youre looking for a specific items info<br />
<br />
3) for the status field on the quest page i usually put either 'ready' when i have all but the jewels or 'done' when ive completed it<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, heres a list of new stuff, the unknown items/marks, and stuff that needs confirmation:<br />
<br />
 new:<br />
Tablet of Spirits, Dawnshroud, Sambata Spiritist, Shaman Coif<br />
<br />
 Not found:<br />
Golden Flower, Enchanter Cap<br />
Hope Pearl, Enchanter Mask<br />
White Garnet, Necromancer Cloak<br />
Mark of Force, Wizard Shawl<br />
Mark of Remedy, Cleric Helm<br />
<br />
<br />
 Confirmation needed:<br />
Runed Ring of Water, ?Tenebrous, meeda hune runemaster<br />
Globe of Power, ?Mons Letalis, powerful thoughteater<br />
Ring of Wit, Tenebrous, ?killer/?frenzied darkwing bat<br />
Mark of Animal Training, Dawnshroud Peaks, ?tenacious lightcrawler<br />
Mark of Redemption, SD, redeemed sun revenant, ?unknown quest<br />
Mark of Force is listed twice for wizard shawl and pants<br />
Hope Onyx is listed twice for enchanter bracer and sandals<br />

<br />
i posted a couple pages ago where i saw that Glorious sunflower I really need to go to sleep though and cant go back for it.<br />
<br />
the &quot;Honored Spire Spirit&quot; drops the star ruby studded medal not the &quot;honored spire lord&quot;<br />
<br />
Fiery stonegrabber in mons drops the Pouch of fire stones not the powerful rockhopper (i think someone else already summitted that correction but hey  )<br />
<br />
the mark of chants drops off a grol baku chanter not a grol baku enchanter (but i think thats been fixed too)<br />
<br />
the killer darkwing bat drops the ring of wit not the frenzied, the frenzied drops a necro piece<br />
<br />
the vas ren highlord is just one word not two as in high lord<br />
<br />
Light spire spirit (bottom floor) drops lite etched star ruby (i could swear it was spelled 'lite' but i'll have to double check   )<br />
<br />
mark of daring is off the zealous zelniak not the raging<br />
<br />
could anyone confirm the Quiet Spire Spirit drops the Mark of Silence? i swear I got one from the Vas ren stalker in scarlet.. but gave it to a rogue friend so i cant double check that mine is called 'mark of silence' also.<br />
<br />
vial of purified water drops from a vas ren waterlord and not a cral ligi one in twilight sea<br />
<br />
and the tro jeg visionary for the mark of vision spawns in scarlet not twilight  <br />
<br />
<br />
I was kinda curious if the Enraptured fire warrior was a Tro Jeg or a Bloodtribe or a Sun revenant myself   anyone know?<br />

<br />
<br />
The mark of rage drops off a raging sun revenant not an enraged sun revenant.. i believe there is such a beast as an Enraged Sun Revenant but I think hes a loot mob that drops the sun leggings and desecrators bracer etc etc.. raging sun revenant spawns where the hearty sun revenant does, at the 5 spawn camp in scarlet.  theyre at the back left spawn <br />
<br />
and in mons its a fiery thought leech not fiery horror, as is the powerful thought leech (not powerful horror)<br />
<br />
and i found the glorious sunflower again.. he was at pos 1654, neg 390<br />
<br />
fiery tro jeg invader was at neg 13, neg 583 if any one cares    <br />
<br />
also the Studded stonegrabber in mons letalis was by the zone to the grey.. just about 200 yards out from the tunnel on the other side of the first rock wall thats straight out.<br />
<br />
anyone else have any notes on where stuff spawns thats static? trying to work on a comprehensive zone guide w/info on where everything that doesnt move spawns.. over the weekend i'll probably dig thru all the posts here and pay attention to where people say stuff pops.<br />
<br />
also-  any one have tips on where to kill stuff for the bloodtribe guys in scarlet? the caves dont work obviously.. and outside the 3 higher level caves i have only gotten loot dropping bloodtribe to pop.

<br />
Almost have all the non-coterie tenebrous pieces.. mostly from hunting the warlords for lewt and the grol baku soldiers for ore.. anyone here have some good theories on a 'rare cycle' in TM similiar to the ones in FM and TT?.. it seems the wandering vah shir skelly, the coterie scout, the 3 warlords, and skyshadow seem to be all on the same spawn cycle as often i will see one after i kill another on the list.. also think that some of the wandering grimlings are on this cycle.. but since i dont have tracking i cant really confirm this just an observation.<br />
<br />
Also had 2 grol baku crystalus (crystali?  ) up at the same time the other day.. that was kinda odd.<br />

also- its a cral ligi poet and not a grol baku poet that drops the page of prose just to clarify that.. i need to print out a newer list since i'm sure a lot of these corrections have been made already.</div></div><hr />

Just one request, when you post the corrections, can you at least mention what class the mob / item is related to? While for a lot of items / Mobs I have a hunch of what class they are for, there are a number that I have no clue about, and need to browse my lists until I find it  . Would be helpful if you could mention the class involved</div></div><hr />

you know youre a twilight quest freak when your server crashes and you start getting really excited because you know the zones just repopped and you're gunna get another 10-20 rares if you hurry   and you set your alarm 4 hours early on patch days and camp in twilight or scarlet so you can hit the rares first thing<br />
<br />
Also you know youre a nut if you are kos to EVERYTHING in scarlet desert and several of your factions there are 'cant get any worse' and you have 2 bank characters dedicated to these and you spend bored moments moving stuff between them so you can alphabetize your marks all on the same char and spend time matching up all the other stuff by the graphic so your bags look all neat and tidy.. now if I could keep my apt so organized hee hee</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a Guild we are kinda working on these.  I mean not focusing all of our efforts on them, but combining our efforts whenever we are in the mood.<br />
<br />
What I don't get is the difficulty vs Reward.  Now this isn't a whine like some others that have  complain about the quests.  It is just that Verant stance on equipment stats is about comparable difficulty vs reward.<br />
<br />
While I am working on these Items I go into it realizing that this gear is inferior to what I can already quest for or win easily.  Half of My Ivy quests are pretty easy for anyone post 30.  Solo.  Getting Rygorr isn't that tough if you have a good high 30s group.  We of course know there are 50s farmers of Ry`gorr as well.  So many of these places to get this stuff requires a FULL group of high 30s if not a partial group of low 40s to hold in order to get the spawn.  The Alien area of Twilight Sea - and Scarlet Desert.  Tough areas.<br />
<br />
I forget what My point is.  I have just seen a lot of folks moan about the stats but no real replies from those that are into these quests.  What do you guys think?<br />

<br />
My opinion?  If you are a monk or Beastlord, do the quests.  You get some good AC armor with a mix of resists and hitpoints.  Int Caster, do a few pieces to fill holes maybe, most not worth it.  Druid, do the tunic, skip the rest.  Bard, maybe do some, cha on every piece can fill some holes.  Ranger/Rogue/Shaman, don't bother, you can get better AC easier elsewhere.  War/Pal/SK fill holes if needed, mostly don't bother, with possible exception of Iksars.  Cleric, BP worth it, rest isn't, unless you have holes to fill.  Bottom line, if you have a regular group that hunts these areas, work on the quests.  If not, you are better off shopping elsewhere.  Results &amp;lt;&amp;lt; effort required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Angelsyn</div><div class="date">04-17-02, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope.  Not hardly.<br />
<br />
However...<br />
<br />
As a Cleric who doesn't belong to a large Guild (heck, the only reason I still have a Guild Tag is because there hasn't been a Guild-wipe recently.) these quests are great.<br />
<br />
Sure, many of the pieces are utterly worthless... (Cleric/Paladin Gauntlets &amp;lt; Gauntlets of the Black... Cleric Bracer &amp;lt; Bracer of the Reverent) Some of them are pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Plus, they've got their own (unique?) colours.<br />
So far, the Cleric Vambraces are a really cool bright Violet on my High Elf Cleric, and the Warrior Boots  appear to be a grey-brown.<br />
<br />
This stuff also makes for  great twink-gear... though I do agree that the AC should be a bit higher on the Chain &amp;amp; Plate gear.</div></div><hr />

I try to see quests as a game. Complete it and you beat Verant at their game (ok so a small victory).<br />
<br />
As for signs of being a twilight quest nut, I have 3 mules holding these items, 5 classes per mule (since there's 15 classes) and a fourth alt-converted mule holding all the duplicates. 2 backpacks for each class, and then some. <br />
<br />
lol<br />
<br />
I have all the tables broken down by zone and then by class, so it's a quick look up to see what &quot;rare&quot; drops what and for what class, tho most of that is memorized from typing all those out, twice (hard drive crashed).<br />
I've got to be over 200 items by now, if the jewels weren't so hard to get, I'd have less.<br />
<br />
Spent 3 hrs one day seperating all items by class and putting them on thier mules. Was a pain the in arse looking thru three mules to find something I needed.<br />
People that are looking for items to trade are being refered to me by others I've traded with. Adds another dimension to the game, I guess.<br />
<br />
Well, there's my cent and a half.<br />
Happy Questing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just have to say... when Luclin just came out and was patching every few days I was doing this!!  Its too funny.  And after 160 unique items, I never did match up one set for any of the class of characters I have.  Until yesterday I was just wandering around and hit track, killed a named, and amazingly enough I completed the robe for my Enchanter.  <br />
<br />
Of all the pieces the Caster Robes are the best I think. The Stats were/are better than my 54 Chanter was previously using.  And it looks great!  A lime green with yellow trimming - not the greatest colors, but different! (looks alot better in the new models than old). <br />
<br />
So now I'm all excited about the quests again eventhough of my top 4-5 alts, I'd probably only equip 2 or 3 pieces.</div></div><hr />

When I killed him, he was roaming The Scarlet Desert, southeast of The Grey zone. If I was to guess at his approximate location, I think it was p200 p1000,<br />

But he was roaming, so that might not be of much help, unless you kill everything that walks thru the area.<br />

In other words, if I camp the coterie fort just North of the Katta zone, will I eventually run into the guard or do I have to camp a different fort? Thanks =)<br />

Also, as far as input on the Coterie.  The camp north of the Katta zone is where we've put most of our time. So far we've gotten a Soldier, Trooper, Commander, Guard, Campaigner, and Gladiator.  Some of the Coterie are deffinatley more rare than others.

Looking for Mark of Remedy, going over the lists, I'm betting it drops in ML off of a Shik'Nar. Since the names of the items dropped are usually similiar to the adjectives of the creatures dropping them, I'd say something like Shik'Nar Healer or something like it.<br />

Finishing off with a few small corrections: <br />
<br />
1) - the Gorget of Concealment (ROG) has AC 6, not AC 7 as is listed now<br />
2) - the chestpiece of the Concealment set (as listed above) is called &quot;Mail of Concealment&quot; and not Tunic of Concealment as it is now. Edited by: Kaysha Soulsinger  at: 6/28/02 5:08:18 am</div></div><hr />

I also reported the inconsistency in spelling as a /bug.<br />
