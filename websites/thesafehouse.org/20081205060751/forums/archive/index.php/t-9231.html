<br />
For me, its most defenitely super speed.  The idea of having the most efficient travel power and going supa fast is awesome to me.  Although my friend can get places faster with fly, hes not so cool hehe.<br />
<br />
Edit: Made a poll - SX</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say superjump is the best balance of speed, maneuverability and end use.<br />
<br />
Teleport definately the fastest by a wide margin, by the way.</div></div><hr />

I've pretty much narrowed it down to teleport and flight, but having never seen teleport in action or knowing how it works it's tough to decide.<br />

I think teleport fits the background of my hero most, but I'm still not convinced.</div></div><hr />

   The ability to TP dead people you need to rez is worth alot just by itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though now that I think about it, it doesn't fit too badly with the idea of my character.  I think Kuro Neko would have learned to fly in the Douglas Adams way;  threw herself at the ground and missed. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I LOVE Super Jump. :) A RL friend I play with has Flight, while it's cool in some cases, I wouldn't trade it for Super Jump ever.<br />
<br />
Besides, Super Jump is the fastest in most cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Super Jump may be the coolest skill I have ever used in any game not sure ill ever take anything but that again.<br />
<br />
I also have Teleport on another toon and it kinda sucks arse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Healer, I love TP. Mainly for the Recall friend ability. Someone gets lost/falls down a hole in faultline/does somethign stupid... I just snatch them back to me, hit them with an absorb pain, and they are good to go.<br />
<br />
As a Blaster or a non-healing Defender/Controller, I'm leaning towards flight. <br />
<br />
With a Melee character, I'm thinking of SS or Jump. Probably go with Jump on the first one at least, and I may make a SS themed scrapper, with a bunch of quick attacks or something.</div></div><hr />

Plus I like being bouncy.<br />

I just hate that I dont get much of a view of the city when I travel as I do leaping around.  However TP itself is the fastest means of travel once u get the hang of it...just not my preferred.<br />
<br />
PS Yeah I do like tp friend on my controller and tp foe which i have for pullin on my solo scrapper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoy flight, because with enhancers you can cruise the street and look like you're Neo or Agent Smith ripping the pavement up. It's also fun to just fly up to the highest thing you can find and gaze across the cityscape ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even more fun to TP up to the highest point... then use recall friend. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">She got a lot better at it, plus the shift keybind, plus slotting endurance.<br />
<br />
The downside to superjump is that I have yet to figure out how to type while travelling.  With flight, you just set course and hit autorun and start chatting.  With Teleport you get there 10 minutes before everyone else and start chatting.  With superspeed you find a highway, hit autorun and start chatting.  With jump you sit there for the entire run holding down the jump key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you TP while you're falling?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qtip4urMamma</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meddik... i'm completely with you!<br />
<br />
Flying to the highest point in the sky, then Teleporting your friends to you, is not only fun as hell to watch, but has a vengeful element to it.  For example, say one of these lame-a**, good for nothing, pathetic kill-stealers come up and kill your FINAL kill for a mission!  Leaving you in awe and despair as you struggle not to put your fist into your monitor!<br />
<br />
Then, you quickly realize something and smile as you target that person and begin to fly higher and higher.  As you're ascending to the skies, quickly talk the target into joining you for a group, promising whatever.  As he accepts your invitation and joins you, and you reach the highest point in the skies, quickly search for a mob (of any lvl really, cause it only takes one hit).  Then proceed to teleport that poor chap next to you, allowing him to fall far out of the sky and directly next to a mob!<br />
<br />
Now, a fall like that unfortunately, will not kill him.  But it will drop him to 1 hp.  That's where the mob comes in.  If successful (and I'm becoming quite good at it) the mob will react and vengeance will be YOURS!!<br />
<br />
Of course, simply killing his family is out of the question due to the fact that you can most likely never locate this person in RL.  I rank kill stealers along with those who quickly quit out of Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow games when losing on X-Box Live, or who order double cheeseburgers with extra bacon and mayo then order a diet soda with it!  Death is the only option, really.  Of course, I would settle for my patined PVC Pipe/Barbed Wire torture... (well... soon to be patined as soon as they stop giving me psych evaluations every time I apply).<br />
<br />
Until next time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekoken</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing beats superjump for the entertainment factor.  Sure getting around the lack of PvP with flying and teleport might be fun but I'm not that vindicative.  I love doing mini-Hulk jumps from building to building with my little dark elf scrapper.  Most fun ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leiciphis</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try being a kinetics defender: with siphon speed &amp;amp; inertial reduction I have every travel power except for teleport. I run at the speed of superspeed people, then jump at the height of superjump people, and, if I don't like where I'm going to land, I actually activate my fly power. <br />
<br />
Tell me I've wasted power slots, and I'll show you one of the most fun time wasters on this game. There's nothing like it. Superjump is definately my fav, but the 3 combined is great fun. When people level up, I ask to run to the leveling place for them. =-)</div></div><hr />
