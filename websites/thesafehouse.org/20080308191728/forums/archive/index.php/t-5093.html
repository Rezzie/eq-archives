<br />
What weapons in midgard are considered thrusting?<br />
<br />
Is it worth it to spec in left axe?<br />
<br />
Can a shadowblade survive well just by using 2handed weapons only?<br />
<br />
Is this a good template?<br />
Stealth-41, CS-39, Axes-37, Envenom-35, Left axe-25<br />
<br />
What websites have rogue templates and guides? (other than this one)<br />
<br />
What is the most popular/deadly Critical strike combo and why?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any advice and suggestions are welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. <br />

<br />
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;What weapons in midgard are considered thrusting?&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
none that shadowblades can use<br />
<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Is it worth it to spec in left axe?&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
LA is going through nerfs/bugs,whatever. its personal choice in the end,you can either spec la,or spec for 2h weapons. with 2h weapons you can fall back to 1h and a shield. whichever you like more,should be how you plan on speccing.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Can a shadowblade survive well just by using 2handed weapons only?&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
yes,although pve combat is a bit harder overall through your level range. left axe,is very good pve,while 2h has its ups and downs<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Is this a good template?<br />
Stealth-41, CS-39, Axes-37, Envenom-35, Left axe-25&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
stealth to high- 35-40 is fine,personal choice,at 35 you will get seen more often till you get lots of rp points. rr4 or better,but more points to invest into weapon/poisons<br />
<br />
cs-fine,higher or lower as you like,dont fall below 34 if you want the pa/cd combo<br />
<br />
envenom-35 is perfect with items/realm ranks can get to high 40s easy,and eventually 50 for lifebane.<br />
<br />
left axe-nope,you either spec left axe or you dont. anything below 34 left axe is a waste,as skill determines your damge with 2 weapons. low skill means you will suffer a penality to damage. <br />
<br />
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;What websites have rogue templates and guides? (other than this one)&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
vault boards,has extensive threads on rogues,look there<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;What is the most popular/deadly Critical strike combo and why?&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
pa/cd- because its your best damage/hidden attack aka critical shot for archers&amp;lt;along the same lines&gt;<br />
<br />
garrote/achellies heel- anytime styles&amp;lt;end hogs&gt;<br />
<br />
hamstring/leaper-evade based styles&amp;lt;best overall damage&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
go 35 stealth and 36 venom, max.  might even keep those lower when we get spellcrafting.</div></div><hr />
