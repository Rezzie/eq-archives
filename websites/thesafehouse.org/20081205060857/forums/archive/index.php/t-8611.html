<br />
I'm on CoV faction raiding ToV with guild currently.  Since I'm fairly new, I have no hope of winning drops for quite a while.  No biggie, eventually the senior members won't need the gear.. lol  I don't even know what the gems dropped from the dragons are for what quest anyways..<br />
<br />
I have the first gem in the PoH quest and all but the Etched Soldier's Crest to get the second level of it.  No one seems to have any idea what or where the Crest drops.. oh well.  My guess would be the DEs in maestro's place.  However that takes a raid at my level and again with low raid points, I won't be winning it for sometime.<br />
<br />
I did the Solstice earring quest.. wow that added 100hps.. woot!  The Electrified Earring of the Tempest (good saves!) is ~6Kpp on MT.. and I just don't have the pp for it atm.<br />
<br />
Trying to get the pieces for the Cloak of Greater Pernicity in PoI (still need to spend ~10kpp for the horn), but have yet to see em drop to get a chance to roll on em.<br />
<br />
Any ideas of what a single strong group around my level could take on to better the gear?</div></div><hr />

Both are Skyshrine quests.  Probably strength of elements too though the Yael fight might give you some trouble, depends on how good your group is (or if not that good, how much DPS you can do).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wristie</div><div class="date">06-26-03, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some decent upgrades for you in some of the Accursed Temple of Cazic Thule drops, and I group there with a solid group all the time.  We rarely have problems.<br />
<br />
And the New Veksar zone can be done with the group you describe, too.  Again, not great drops, but better than some of the stuff you have...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lias</div><div class="date">07-07-03, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not do Grimror's Bugs quest in PoD?<br />
<br />
everquest.allakhazam.com/...quest=2213<br />
<br />
It will give you xp.  I happen to like the direct reward (Bangle of Disease Warding) because I play on a PvP server - but the insta-cast is useful when fighting any MOB that casts dispell.<br />
<br />
The best reason to do the quest tho,  is that it gives you a flag that can be used in the Storytime quest:<br />
<br />
everquest.allakhazam.com/...quest=2469<br />
<br />
I completed Grimror's Bugs on Saturday and my Intricate Wooden Figurine charm gained an immediate stat boost.  On talking to the Storytime quest NPC I gained an AAXP, and the other members of my group all gained their charm and the AAXP as well.  Level 52 Ogres (old models, of course) all bouncing up and down with glee.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth I essentially did the whole quest without a cleric or an enchanter. SK and necro aggro-kiting did the trick...  and I think that rogues are a great help in such situations.<br />
