<br />
My question is, considering PA can only be used from a hiding position, which is a better skill to use as an opening (especially in RvR) - bs II or PA. <br />
<br />

<br />
Both PA and BSII require that you are hidden.  PA is going to do more damage than BSII, so I would suggest opening with PA.  However, there are times when you cannot get in the &quot;front&quot; position to execute PA, and therefore it helps to have BSII hotkeyed somewhere.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps  <br />

<br />
In RvR, I would go with PA. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_UnfinishedClass</div><div class="date">03-25-02, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick example of BSII, was doing the normal sneaky thing in Odin's Gate, ( I'm a 41 Infiltrator ) when I notice this red caster.  Now with reds I have 1 chance to get in to do any dmg at all before im uncovered and killed quite quickly.  I start my approach knowing that it's rush in kill and get out as quick as I can.  He was facing me and had both weapons poisoned, just at the moment of attack, he turned to face the other way.  Very quickly I changed to my BS II hotbar, executed the attacks perfectly, by the time the stun wore off and he started to turn to face me he was only at half life.  I then started using my garottes with follow ups which promptly ended his vacation to the snowy lands of Midguard.  <br />
<br />
Since then have used BS II quite often to shorten the trips of many a foe and never again will I hesitate to use it.<br />

<br />
We think of sneaking up &quot;in front&quot; of someone being more detectable due to our PvE experience with Mobs having more chance to uncover from facing side. In PvE sneaking up behind target then dropping yer distract pebble at yer own feet is safer then a frontal approach (by about 3 seconds risk). <br />
<br />
In RvR a frontal approach is safer BECAUSE the guy is looking at his own back. I even had a mob uncover me 3 PACES in front of a big bad troll. I took a step back, stealthed, and reattacked! He never saw me because his own big arse blocked his view of me wee luri. <br />
<br />
Go figger. In the long run it's all a coin toss and the first blow wins.<br />

Its easier to BS2 them, then try and get around them (into the enemy group) to perf.<br />
<br />
I also use it for rangers/scouts sometimes.  I'll start following them, then stick and BS2 stunning them.  After that a garrote or 2 and they are dead.   Wolven Spikefeather, Hunter<br />
