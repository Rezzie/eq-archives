<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mysthyl</div><div class="date">10-19-03, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the easy ldon missions it seams most mobs are immune to charm with a few possible expections (such exceptions being immune to snare instead). Mummies in MM and wolves in rujarkian are a couple. My question is how does charm carry through to the hard adventures. Which mobs (if any) can be charmed and are they immune to snare like the charmable ones in regular difficulty? And how does all this effect rogues trying to get groups for hard adventures as oppose to easy ones?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Mistmoore - Mummy<br />
Miragul's - Holgresh<br />
Takish`Hiz - Stone Golem<br />
Deepest Guk - Evil Eyes<br />
Rujarkian - Wolves<br />
<br />
These same mobs are charmable regardless if you do normal or hard and, yes, they are immune to snare in both. <br />

<br />
Yup, although there is one important difference.  These mobs can be 65 on hard, which means uncharmable.  So you've got to find the model and it can't be 65.  Makes a critter to charm harder to find.  Of course, if you do find one, it does serious damage.  But first you have to find it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Due to the nastier nature of hard mobs, more support classes are desirable.  Combine that with the uncertainty of charm and it makes support classes even more desirable.  More slots dedicated to support means less to pure DPS.  However, that also makes high DPS in those slots more important.<br />
<br />
But much of it has to do with the people you're doing hard with.  The better geared and AA'd they are, the less important support is, the more DPS you can pack in.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to sum it up, it's who you know that that has the biggest impact on doing hard groups.  If they know you're good enough, you'll get them, but most likely only if you're in their guild.</div></div><hr />

Pulling was such a PAIN that by the time we had it down, we were below the 1:1 kill time ratio (ie at half time, more then half the remaining mobs still alive), it took us a while to get a good pull rythem (and using alot of pearls for coh ^^) as well as working with the golem we decided to charm, when all worked smoothly, the mobs were dead quickly because the golem had amazing dps. it was hitting for 900!<br />
<br />
we where down to 2 mobd at 8 minutes but the pull came with an add that killed me (cleric). The group succored quickly and i ran in from my bind outside, killed the golem (that returned to its spawn) for 1 kill and then got most of my eq and proceeded to kill one more to win the adventure. <br />
<br />
Tak sucks btw for hard, we proceeded to goto an EC assasinate adventure and won the damn thing with like 25 minutes to spare.</div></div><hr />

Guk because of the uncertainty of all the pulls (stuf hide behind corners), and Tak in general is just too packed to pull reliably with mobs resisting pacify so much on Hard.<br />
<br />
Charmed pet makes room breaks pretty easy though, just send pet in on the 3 mobs you pulled and that'll give you time to sort them out... as long as pet didn't happen to break the exact moment you send it in.<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that you might not always have a pet to charm at all, I think it'd be wise for a group to have enough DPS to be able to finish a mission without charm at all.  I'd certainly want high DPS classes because it could be a good half of the mission before you are able to find something to charm.</div></div><hr />
