I guess I should stop going to Atlas park and places like that.  Getting all the newbs killed sucks.  Just a minor gripe on some of the missions in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy solution...kill your ambushers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the only problems with high level ambushes in low level zones are:<br />
<br />
1. The ambusher doesn't care about it and doesn't kill the villians<br />
2. The ambusher doesn't realise the ambush because of the travel powers - he's gone before the mobs reach him (happened to me at least once)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are the ambushes?  I wonder if this has happened to me.  I came out of a low level mission last night and ran into 5th Column guys in Galaxy city, I don't recall seeing them in Galaxy city before.<br />
<br />
Another time I saw an absolutely huge swarm of bad guys that were purple to me, can't remember where or which character.  But again, it was another weird place for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aura</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the hell is an ambush - and why do I feel like me asking that question means I've gotten countless newbies killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some times you will accept a mission, head off toward it, and when you get to the zone, enemies will spawn, chase you down and attack you. Generally much higher level, and scaled to your group size as well. You don't know its an ambush until you get attacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aura</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah... yeah - unless they fly, they're just spawning to kill noobs. R.I.P. Noobitses..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few days ago, Clockwork Jack (who's bio reads that he's a malfunction escapee from the Clockwork King), was ambushed by a group of clockwork while standing in front of Ms. Liberty in Atlas Park. They directly went for him and none of the other few dozen people nearby.<br />
<br />
The interesting part was he had no pending missions at the time, so I had the strangest suspicion a GM somewhere was having fun with me. Of course I used the incident to RP a little after. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always figured those 5th in Gal City came from a rooftop somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience with ambushes is that they A) Scale to your group, B) are the same level as the person being ambushed (but may be same level lt or bosses), C) spawn roughly 30 seconds after you talk to an NPC, and D) will follow you as long as you are in the same zone.<br />
<br />
I started getting them around level 16 on both toons.  They consistently try and get to me ignoring others until such time as I kill them or zone.  After zoning they seem to just stand around unless someone attacks them, in which case they go to agro mode and start attacking anyone as if they were normal mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyone else see this behavior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I've had some kill me when I was wondering by.<br />
<br />
1st hit took off 99% of health, the second killed me, all before I could port. No idea what lvl they were or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never been ambushed.  About what level does that start to happen?  Can you ambushed when you're very low on health?<br />
<br />
Can happen as low as level 2.  The natural origin's early 5th column missions include quite a few ambushes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've probably been ambushed then and didn't realize it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crazy ant</div><div class="date">06-09-04, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So THAT's what it was... I was getting a clockwork mission... the one in which you get the EMP gauntlet, when out of nowhere a few clockworks came at me. I thought they were just in the area and I happened to wander too close. After I took 'em out, though, I couldn't find any clockworks anywhere near the area I got attacked in. Must've been a mini-ambush on lil' ol' me. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">06-09-04, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL!  I've had this happen too and didn't even realize it was an ambush until I read this.  God, I love this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">06-09-04, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best one I had was night Sabatini and I are running around doing missions.  I get a Tsoo door mission and he gets a Outcast one. So I'm sitting at the Skyway tram line when a ninja and sorcer hit squad comes running in (past the drones who usually zap any such ruffians) and starts beating on me.  I got lucky enough for other folks to help out.  So he and I are laughing about it and disembark in Steel Canyon to see one of his contacts and then do the tsoo mission. Soon as we get to his contact, a 8 man Outcast ambush party jumps him.  Was a 2 for 1 night for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-09-04, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if this is an ambush or not....but my Natural Scrapper was doing the 5th Legion Missions from E.L.I.T.E, around lvl 5 or 6. After completeing {insert heroic type goal here}, I'd leave the building, and get jumped instantly by 5th legions 2 or 3 lvls above the ones I just killed. Example: I was fighting 1 and 2 man groups of Nebel Rifle and UnterOffizer for the mission, as I left the building, 2 Flire Nebels and some other exceedingly nasty **** pop out of no where. Chased me all the way from King's Row zone area to Freedom Court. They don't stop either! I outdistanced them by aways, stopped to pick a fight, finished it, and the bastages came rolling up on me again!</div></div><hr />

I'm a grav controller who's focused on holding things in place for as long as possible without allowing them to do anything in return.  As a consequence, I do little to no damage.  When I get hit by a bunch of mobs, I go down.  Fast.  I freaking hate ambushes.<br />

The Oscillators move faster than everyone else, so if you get hit by 1 or two oscs, it gives you some warnign before the rest of the crowd gets there.</div></div><hr />

It was kinda funny from an RP standpoint. HAHA! We got you! *wiff wiff wiff wiff wiff wiff* *heroes look around at each other, shrug and fly off* <br />

I have a mind controller, and I don't find it THAT difficult to deal with ambushes.  Unless I've engaged something else and get ambushed in the middle of a fight.</div></div><hr />

My most damaging attack at level 23 is a whopping 25 points of damage I think.  And that recharges very slowly.  I've focused on my group-abilities and completely ignored my ability to kill things solo.  Which was a decision I made, so I'm not complaining.  I just don't handle ambushes well because there's a group of my-level mobs coming after me, which is impossible for me to kill since I just don't put out enough damage before I'm completely out of endurance.<br />

Yeah, same here.  Me killing is like watching paint-dry.  Still, I do solo occassionally. :)  It's dominate, levitate, dominate, levitate... over and over until dead.  Either me or it.  <br />
<br />
My long lasting mez keeps the adds asleep until #1 is dead, then rinse and repeat.<br />

I roled up a baby Illusion/Kinetics controller and at level 6 he does more damage than my level 16 mind controller.  /jealous</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">06-11-04, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's always the same missions you get ambushed as well, and usually when you talk to an NPC on the street(either your contact or the person your contact sent you to speak to).<br />
<br />
While the size of the attack does scale to your group, when your solo its always seems to be 2 even con minions.<br />
<br />
Also, stealth is no proof against them.  Once they are on your tail, its not uncommon that I'm just standing around with stealth on and see a pair of clockworks come running down the street 5 minutes after I've accepted a mission(usually because they spawn somewhere in the middle of the zone and run towards you as fast as they can).<br />
<br />
Also of note, so far, everytime I've gotten a kill mission where I was given a temporary power it has ALWAYS resulted in an ambush.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">06-11-04, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were doing the synapse TF yesterday and just before the Boomtown bit with Bertha we were ambushed....  rather I was ambushed.   We were a group of 8 so it was a whole slew of clockworks all level 20.  This was in Steel Canyon.<br />
<br />
The group kept porting me away when I was close to dying and then they all zoned into Boomtown without killing the ambushers.  I stayed trying to lure them to the police drones at least.  I was the only tanker so I could have put a severe halt to the mission.  Hopefully they did get killed by the drones, though lvl 20s in Steel Canyon isn't too out of line.</div></div><hr />
