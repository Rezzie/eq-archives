<br />
I would think that pumping mastery of arms would be worth it since a 3% reduction in attack speed on a slow 2hander is a noticeable difference.  Since most critblades who use 2handers seem to have weapon speed as the only downside, does this sucessfully counteract that?  Or is the realm point investment too much?<br />
<br />
How about mastery of pain?  A 15% chance to crit seems to imply that a 2h using critzerker should be able to crit 1 out of every 6 swings.  However, I would think that mastery of arms would be useful for 2h while pain left axe users, since you swing more.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />

<br />
As an infiltrator I have mop 3 and have noticed a dramatic increase in critical hits.  Not only am I getting more crits in, but they seem to be higher damage on the crits.  With mop 3 I would guess that I crit on about 25-30% of my attacks and for pretty good damage.<br />
<br />
I normally use fast weapons, so when I crit it is not that high, but I can count on 3-4 crts per fight.  As a 2-hand critblade I would definately take this ability.  You are basing your character to do big damage per hit, having a 25% chance to do up to double damage seems like it would go along with your character profile pretty well.  Also, you would have many of those oh so fun 1700 damage perfs that piss people off so much(against non-epic armor opponents of course)<br />
<br />
I think the 2-hand critblade is still a very viable template, but be warned, that you will be hurting at high level against opponents with epic armor.</div></div><hr />

However, on andred its safe to say no one will have decent armor off high end mobs for awhile.  If respec goes in I plan in a few months going to a shadowzerker.  In the underequipped realm, the critblade rules IMO.<br />
