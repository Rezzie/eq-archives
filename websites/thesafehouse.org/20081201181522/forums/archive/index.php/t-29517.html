Honestly, I don't think it's even worth using. You can simply clear your pvp target and just restealth and get the same effect nearly any time you want, though it does no real good as once you've been detected you stay detected for the most part. I've only ever had it work for me once, when I was trying to finish off a target when he buddy joined in...I managed to kill my target and smoke bomb right as the guy was nearly on top of me and I guess he didn't see me...I was able to casually walk away while he ran all over the place trying to find me.</div></div><hr />
