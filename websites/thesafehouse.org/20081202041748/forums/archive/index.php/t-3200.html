<br />
All 5 different versions are mutually exclusive on a character... <br />
<br />
Say you have an Armor Enchance +2 and +4 item on, only the +4 will give you a benefit, same goes for all the categories I believe, except for Dodge - which stacks until +5 I believe (and I think... Dex AC is considered Dodge AC... but I'm rusty - own the 3rd Ed books but never got to use 'em)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aelodyn</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In 3rd edition, there are lots of ways to gain AC benefits. Some of these ways stack, some don't. Off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;Armor&lt;/u&gt; bonuses supercede each other. An armor bonus usually comes from wearing physical armor such as banded mail, or from a magic item or spell that adds an armor bonus to AC. For instance, the arcane spell    mage armor adds a +4 armor bonus to AC, and doesn't stack with other armor bonuses. If you donned a pair of    +2 bracers of armor, your net armnor bonus to AC would still only be +4. There is an exception to this rule: the shield. Armor bonuses from using a shield stack with armor bonuses from other sources.<br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt; Dodge&lt;/u&gt; bonuses come from your Dexterity modifier and the Dodge/Mobility feat chain. Dodge bonuses stack with each other, and you can add them infinitely. However, you lose all dodge bonuses to AC when you are caught flat-footed, such as in the first round of combat before your initiative turn. Dodge bonuses stack with armor bonuses.<br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;Natural armor&lt;/u&gt; bonuses to AC come from having a very thick skin or hide, or from spells or magic items that simulate natural armor, such as the spell    barkskin. Natural armor bonuses do not stack with each other, but &lt;u&gt;do&lt;/u&gt; stack with armor bonuses and dodge bonuses to AC. <br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt; Deflection&lt;/u&gt; bonuses to AC come from magic items or spells that protect your character with a magical, invisible force field. Like armor bonuses and natural armor bonuses, deflection bonuses do not stack with each other, but &lt;u&gt;do&lt;/u&gt; stack with other AC modifier types.  Rings of protection and  cloaks of protection are two types of AC items that provide deflection bonuses. <br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;Other&lt;/u&gt; bonuses to AC are possible in 3rd edition. The system is open-ended and flexible. The only type of AC modifier that I am aware of in NWN that falls into the &quot;other&quot; category is the Monk class's Wisdom bonus to AC. Monks gain their Wisdom modifier to their AC, if positive, as long as they are not wearing any armor. This is not a dodge bonus, because they retain it even while flat-footed. <br />
<br />

This determines the initiative order, or the order of combat. The computer rolls 1d20, adds your Dex modifier, and places you in the order. Higher is better. If you haven't yet acted in the first round of combat, you're flat-footed (unless you're a rogue or a barbarian with Uncanny Dodge.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_toxickglobal</div><div class="date">06-25-02, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 'dink there are other mods to the initative roll...i.e. weapon negs...big stuff swings slower, so monks tend to strike first 'cause their' barehanded not sure..some additional info would help  ..heh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_FedaTheMonk</div><div class="date">06-26-02, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Initiative is calculated thus:<br />
<br />
you roll a d20, then add in whatever feat bonuses or item bonuses you have... <br />
<br />
so say I have improved initiative (I think its 4, don't have my rule book at work) and roll a 14, then my initiative is 18 and the guy I'm fighting with rolls and initative of 26 (natural 20, plus blooded, plus improved initiative feats), and the goblin we are fighting against has an initiative of 10 (the DM rolls that, we don't really know the exact number) so my friend goes, then I, then the poor goblin who is probably already dead<br />
