<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:07:28 2004] Smith Dandi says 'Hail to you, Atwa. Everything going well with the blade, I hope? As I said before, I couldn't craft it according to your exact specifications. The metal we have to work with isn't exactly 'Velixite', and I had to substitute the closest thing we have. Also, I had to improvise on a few details that weren't fully described in your documents. With an example to work from I could get a little closer to perfection.' <br />
<br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:07:47 2004] You say, 'Hail, Lirprin, Head of Affairs' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:07:47 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs says 'I'm sure Stanos has already briefed you on his concerns: An assassin is planning to start a war between the Dragorn and the Wayfarer's by offing a well-respected member of their society and making it look like it was us. This is true. I've verified the information myself. What Stanos doesn't know, and I'm embarrassed to admit . . . It's one of my people that's behind it all.' He fumes, and smashes his left fist into his opposite palm. 'Bah. If I ever get my hands on the scoundrel! If I even knew WHICH one it was! We've had a disturbing number of our rank go 'deserter' since my group's last visit to the Realms of Discord. Haven't heard from some of my members in days, weeks, or months. It's one of those scumbags. I'd bet my  that it's either [Lairyn Debeian], [Wren Simsy], [Longarm Larithim], [Durgin Skell] or [Keetra the Lost]. If you can prove without a shadow of a doubt, please tell me you [know who is guilty].' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:08:44 2004] You say, 'what bronze breastplate' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:08:44 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs sighs, 'I'm not really wearing a bronze breastplate, Atwa. That's what we like to call a 'figure of speech'.' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:09:00 2004] You say, 'who is Lairyn Debeian' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:09:00 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs says 'Yes, Lairyn Debeian. Does his name sound familiar to you? It should - that's Nedaria's brother. He left my side long ago to research new magics, and for the better part of the years he kept in touch. We had been corresponding by mail. The last letter I received from him was written in a desperate scrawl. His tone was fearful and angry, which isn't like him at all. He spoke of shadows and hearing voices in his head. I'm afraid he may have done something rash. Something horrible. Don't let his frail appearance fool you, Atwa. He's from the same blood as Nedaria and very powerful. If you find him, drop my name. Let him know Lirprin sent you and see if he can explain his odd behavior.' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:10:37 2004] You say, 'wren simsy' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:10:37 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs says 'Ah, Wren. Mistress of disguise and as deadly as they come. She always obeyed orders and was ruthlessly efficient in her tasks, but I've got this feeling that what she did for the Brotherhood was done begrudgingly. That is to say, I think she was biding her time waiting for an opportunity to leave. And leave she did. She and some of the impressionable members of my group disappeared a few weeks ago. In typical rogue-like fashion, they made off with most of our supplies, too. The more unsavory Wayfarer pledges were quite taken with her striking beauty and her skill with a blade. I imagine they'd follow her anywhere. If you find her, drop my name. Let her know Lirprin sent you and see if she can explain her disappearance and theft.' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:13:25 2004] You say, 'Longarm ' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:13:26 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs says 'Bah, just hearing his name is like hearing the screech of a harpy. The little twerp didn't care for the dangerous environment of Kuaa and deserted us without so much as a goodbye. This is the kind of behavior I have to deal with on a daily basis, and what's going to be the death of me. I swear I'll throw shackles on the next walking panic attack that whimpers about wanting to go back to their home. It goes without saying that Larithim was a roguish type and I wouldn't put it past him to do something rash and stupid. Someone overheard him saying he'd do anything to send us packing back to Norrath, for good. Starting a war with the Dragorn would fit that bill. Who knows what hole Larithim's cowering in now. There are a lot of hiding spots for a fainthearted three-foot tall gnome. If you find him, drop my name. Let him know Lirprin sent you and see if he can explain his desertion.' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:14:06 2004] You say, 'Durgin' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:14:06 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs says 'I've had the pleasure of serving with a beastlord named Sharalla for quite awhile. For years, she was a reliable friend and companion. At one point I nearly asked her to become my betrothed - we were that close. However, things changed the moment she met that scoundrel Durgin Skell. Her dedication to the Wayfarer's cause wavered noticably whenever he was about. Last time I saw them, Durgin and Sharalla were preparing for [some foolish expedition]. They took a cadre of my best people, ventured off in search a 'great threat' to Norrath and haven't been seen since. I trust Durgin about as far as I can pitch an orc. There's a good chance he's used his silver tongue and charismatic appearance to misguide his group into doing something foolish. If you find him, drop my name. Let him know Lirprin sent you and see if he can explain what he's been up to.' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:14:36 2004] You say, 'some foolish expedition' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:14:36 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs says 'Yes, foolish indeed. He kept mentioning something about a frozen underground cavern below Everfrost and the nightmarish creatures that resided within. We had heard rumors of such a place, but I wouldn't give them much credibility. They're only rumors, after all.' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:14:36 2004] [b]You do not meet the player count requirement. You have 1 players. You must have at least 10 and no more than 36. <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:15:00 2004] You say, 'Keetra' <br />
<br />
[Mon Oct 04 15:15:01 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs says ''Keetra the Lost' is right. She was simply 'Keetra' until we discovered her uncanny knack for straying off the beaten path. We couldn't travel half a mile without having to double back to find Keetra. You don't want to know how many times we sent a search team to locate her sorry hide. What I need to know is, was this simply absent-minded disorientation or was she feigning ignorance, trying to escape? I'm inclined to say it was the former, but with this war on the horizon we can't be too careful. Having another thief slip out of sight is not something we can afford to ignore. If you find her, drop my name. Let her know Lirprin sent you and see if she can explain where she's been.' <br />

Laeryn Debeian <br />
<br />
Lairyn Spawns in the Gulf of Gunthak in the 2nd hut behind the big lighthouse.<br />
<br />
[Tue Oct 05 13:08:06 2004] You say, 'Hail, Lairyn Debeian' <br />
<br />
[Tue Oct 05 13:08:06 2004] Lairyn Debeian stares at you directly in the eyes. 'Greetings, Atwa. I suppose you're here like everyone else in search of fame and fortune. Good luck to you, and good day. I have many things to attend to.' <br />
[Tue Oct 05 13:07:14 2004] Avryce tells the group, 'rofl' <br />
<br />
[Tue Oct 05 13:07:16 2004] You say, 'Liprin sent me' <br />
<br />
[Tue Oct 05 13:07:16 2004] Lairyn Debeian is disturbingly pale for an Erudite. He looks terribly frightened. 'They'll return any moment! The shadows are everywhere, always watching . . . Waiting for me to rest so they can kill me. I try to fight them off but they always return. They whisper to me when I am all alone. No one else in the gulf believes me. You must help! Please believe that what I say is true! Oh no, here they come - please don't let the shadows take me away!' <br />
<br />
Lairyn proceeds to run to the beach. He stands kind of behind the big rock in the middle of the beach. ( I'll get a loc when I try again ). Lairyn shouts a few zonewide emotes about the shadows coming to get him. This is your time to find him and set up very quicly. <br />
<br />
On the 5th wave or so Krill the Backbleeder spawns. Lvl 70 shadowman. <br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:23 2004] You pierce Krill the Backbleeder for 215 points of damage. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:24 2004] You pierce Krill the Backbleeder for 95 points of damage. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:24 2004] You pierce Krill the Backbleeder for 277 points of damage. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:24 2004] You pierce Krill the Backbleeder for 321 points of damage. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:24 2004] You pierce Krill the Backbleeder for 321 points of damage. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:24 2004] You have slain Krill the Backbleeder! <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:24 2004] Lairyn Debeian says 'For my own knowledge and to bring some closure to this terror, can you bring me his head? I want to see with my own eyes. I need to know if it was him.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:35 2004] You tell your raid, 'Shiv, Baling Hook, Krill's Head, Bloodied Torn Parchment' <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:36 2004] The war march fades. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:42 2004] --You have looted a Bloodied Torn Parchment.-- <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:43 2004] The spirit of Krekk fades. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:45 2004] --You have looted a Krill's Head.-- <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:10:46 2004] You no longer have a target. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:11:02 2004] Lairyn Debeian adjusts his spectacles and peers at the head, 'True enough. This is a Wayfarer . . . Errr, was at one time. I imagine he renounced his membership in the Brotherhood sometime before he took up a career of tormenting a poor scholar. They must have been trying to get to Nedaria by coming after me. I am famliar with Krill and he is a follower, not a leader. Someone else is the mastermind behind this - a person with access to magical disguises to hide their identity. Lirprin must know of this at once, Sanam. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:11:02 2004] You have confirmed Lairyn's innocence. <br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:17:45 2004] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:18:05 2004] You have entered Nedaria's Landing. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:18:50 2004] You say, 'Hail, Lirprin, Head of Affairs' <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:18:50 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs says 'I'm sure Stanos has already briefed you on his concerns: An assassin is planning to start a war between the Dragorn and the Wayfarer's by offing a well-respected member of their society and making it look like it was us. This is true. I've verified the information myself. What Stanos doesn't know, and I'm embarrassed to admit . . . It's one of my people that's behind it all.' He fumes, and smashes his left fist into his opposite palm. 'Bah. If I ever get my hands on the scoundrel! If I even knew WHICH one it was! We've had a disturbing number of our rank go 'deserter' since my group's last visit to the Realms of Discord. Haven't heard from some of my members in days, weeks, or months. It's one of those scumbags. I'd bet my  that it's either [Lairyn Debeian], [Wren Simsy], [Longarm Larithim], [Durgin Skell] or [Keetra the Lost]. If you can prove without a shadow of a doubt, please tell me you [know who is guilty].' <br />
**Turned in Bloodied Torn Parchment which was returned*** <br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:19:01 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs says 'I have no need for this item Sanam, you can have it back.' <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:19:08 2004] You say, 'lairyn' <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:19:08 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs says 'Yes, Lairyn Debeian. Does his name sound familiar to you? It should - that's Nedaria's brother. He left my side long ago to research new magics, and for the better part of the years he kept in touch. We had been corresponding by mail. The last letter I received from him was written in a desperate scrawl. His tone was fearful and angry, which isn't like him at all. He spoke of shadows and hearing voices in his head.

Let him know Lirprin sent you and see if he can explain his odd behavior.' <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:19:39 2004] It begins to rain. <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:19:48 2004] You say, 'krill' <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:19:53 2004] You say, 'krill was guilty' <br />
[Fri Oct 08 15:19:53 2004] Lirprin, Head of Affairs listens patiently to all you have to say. 'Ah, well done Sanam. Clearing the names of those Wayfarers allays my fears a bit, but that still doesn't narrow it down to one person. Keep looking for [Lairyn Debeian], [Wren Simsy], [Longarm Larithim], [Durgin Skell] and [Keetra the Lost]. Come back and speak with me when you know more.' [b]Thanks Sanam from Talisman<br />

[Mon Oct 11 10:57:57 2004] You say, 'liprin sent me' <br />
[Mon Oct 11 10:57:58 2004] Lookout Larithim says 'Lirprin sent ye, did he mate? I was beginnin' ta wonder when the perils of me dastardly mutiny would catch up with me. Tis my shame, and I'll shoulder the burden 'til the day I rest at the bottom of the ocean. To tell ye the truth Cap'n Lirprin treated us alright, but te be away from ship n' sail was murder. I'd rather be scrapin' barnacles for all eternity than spend another moment in yon Discord Plane. Only, well, it seems that me ship and sail are gone again.' Larithim sighs dramatically, and waits for the effect to sink in before continuing. 'Would ye like ta [hear the tale], landlubber? Tis guaranteed to bring a tear ta the eye o' even the saltiest sea dog. Arrrr.' <br />
[Mon Oct 11 10:58:14 2004] You say, 'hear the tale' <br />
[Mon Oct 11 10:58:14 2004] Lookout Larithim says 'Allow me te paint ye the picture, Sanam, of a story so strange and frightenin'! Twasn't more than a fortnight followin' my glorious return to plunderin'. I was bringin' me ship, Glaciersmash, into the coast ye see before ya now. The weather was cruel and unrelentin'. Waves they were crashin' up against the port bow.' He motions with his arms to indicate large waves, and makes a shrill blowing sound to imitate the wind. 'Hoist the main sail, tug the riggin's and man the longboats men, says I. That's when a twisting tentacle as thick as yer leg stretched out from the waters and latched ahold of the main mast! Guess ye [what happened then]?' <br />
[Mon Oct 11 10:58:40 2004] You say, 'what happened then' <br />
[Mon Oct 11 10:58:41 2004] Lookout Larithim says 'Arrr. The boat she tipped and groaned, wood bucklin' and rope snappin'. My precious cargo of metal alloy spilled overboard. Before we knew it, she capsized like a maiden's . . . Wait, is that . . .? Well I'll be a crusty barnacle. Ye see that there, Sanam!? NO, not the tower. There it is again - the scurvy squid has returned. IT BE THE POLAR KRAKEN! Get out there and harpoon its backside, Sanam. I'll keep a sharp lookout here and we'll split the booty. The alloy will oxidize right quick if ye expose it to the air - stash it in here and bring it back te me.' <br />

***WARNING THIS CONTAINS A SPOILER*** <br />
<br />
Everfrost LDON For Epic: Miragul's: Frozen Nightmare. <br />
(Disclaimer: All of this is to the best of my knowledge) <br />
ok first of all I would highly recommend all 36 people for this expedition, I believe shamroc put it like this, It is &quot;uncheese-able&quot;. Also thanks to shamroc for telling me how to kill the skeletons from the 7th circle of hell. <br />
On another note the expedition has 6 mini-events including the boss fight I am going to run through them now. But before here is some General info. <br />
<br />
- Everything Sees SoS. Upon zone in about 10 mobs will rush your group. Trash hits for 900 slowable/mezable. They are spiders. Recommended way of dealing with this: Cleric with DB up zones in gets agro then calls the raid to zone in if DB wears off use Bestow DA, It is instant cast time. Another thing, All LDON raids have a Death Limit of 36, im not positive this does but I can say its a safe assumption. Make sure YOU as in, The rogue this is for talks to Durgin and nobody else. There could be some invis flags. <br />
<br />
- After the spiders you move out through the first hall and Trigger an Event. I'll nick name this the ring of Zurg. <br />
<br />
- Ring of Zurg: Split your raid up EVENLY into 2 teams. (That means tanks mez's slows dps and heals evenly spread) Call them Team A/B. When you move out of the first room a goblin will run off down the left side. DONT GIVE CHASE. The goblin will spawn the ring event. 2 raid leaders pop and you start getting zurginated by little green goblins Ignore them. Team a goes left and team b strait find the raid leaders and kill them asap. Keep in mind you cant clear the area's or you will be ported out because the goblin horde successfully zurged you. When the script starts you get this message - It must be an ambush! An army of ice goblins are pouring forth, rushing in from every direction. Judging by the cacophony of shrill voices echoing in the distance there are many more on the way. Their leaders must be nearby . . . <br />
So, Recommended Strat for this. Dont wait for the script to start before rushing. Have a pally/sk in each Team lead the train to the raid leaders (Team A. left: Team b. strait) with harmshield/da up. Rush and engage the Raidleaders, (They dont hit hard) burn them down asap and as soon as you get them dead the goblin horde will stop rushing you and retreat. (Depop) Once the raidleaders are dead it isnt over, You must kill all the spiders you had to train there. <br />
<br />
- Next you plow to Durgin Skell, Hail him and follow the prompts he will give you his story of how his adventuring party has been slain, And he wants you to perform 4 tasks for him. The tasks are their own mini event.(text of durgin to follow) <br />
You say, Hail Durgin Skell. <br />
Durgin Skell gasps with surprise. 'By Morden's brown beard, thank goodness you've come! I'm the only one left alive. I was able to duck away and hide during the chaos of battle when it became apparent that we were in too deep. My party members were not so lucky, as each was slain by the denizens of this frozen nightmare. We must end the reign of madness in this place and exterminate the [monstrosities] that have killed my brothers and sisters!' <br />
<br />
- Task 1: The blob, In the room past Durgin there is the blob. This would be mini event 1. There is also alot of adds in the room and surrounding. DONT AGRO THE SURROUNDING ROOMS. Have a warrior rush with fortitude and engage the Blob in the middle of the room then have everyone else run in. Use knights/other war's to peel the mobs off the Tank. make sure to kill the Adds first. <br />
Stats on the blob(a sundering sludge is his real name btw!):I wasnt getting hit so dont ask me how hard he hits ! if I had to guess i'd say oh... 1500! , When you kill him he splits into 4 other mobs named &quot;a severing sludge.&quot; All are mezable. Kill, *ONE AT A TIME* . When you kill one it splits into 4 more mobs named &quot;a slippery sludge&quot;. All are mezable again kill those 4, and then Proceed to kill the severing sludges one by one. killing the adds they spawn.The sludges Flurry. <br />
After the final sludge is killed you get this message. <br />
<br />
One of the four tasks has been completed <br />
<br />
- Task 2: The Skeletons of Joy. - I can't even begin to describe how retarded this ecnounter is, so lets just get down to Buisiness. (Remove all damage shields and have your knights, who will be tanking the 4 skeletons remove their weapons before doing this) The skeletons Durgin Describes are 4 skeletons called &quot;A chromatic skeleton or An Icy Skeleton&quot; they hit for like 1100. Pull them and get them in a corner with 4 knights on them. Kill them one by one until they are all RED. Then beat the red ones down to 1% and have your wizards blast them with a PB - AE and Earn your badge of Gayness, Once they are destroyed - <br />
<br />
Two of the four tasks has been completed <br />
<br />
- Task 3: The bone Golem (I know I can't think of a witty comment for this one sorry) Marrow the Broken regards you indifferently -- looks like it would wipe the floor with you! <br />
- Strait forward fight. Golem Rampages, Its AE. Kill the Golem, He spawns adds. kill the adds as they spawn, and you should be ok. He hits for 1800. <br />
<br />
Three of the four tasks has been completed <br />
<br />
Check your progress with durgin at this point to make sure it looks like this. <br />
<br />
Ah, you found a way to put the chromatic skeletons to permanent rest. Your ingenuity never ceases to amaze me. <br />
From the bits of dust and bone on your armor I can tell you have successfully handled Miragul's splintering bone golem. <br />
Well now . . . I see you have destroyed the splitting sludge. Quite an annoying pest, isn't it? <br />
<br />
- Task 4: Protects Durgin's love. This is a unique encounter, Because you can fail it and still Accomplish the task. You (As in the rogue) should be the one to Hail, her warder. <br />
I'll Humor you guys and let orruar explain this. <br />
<br />
Orruar tells the raid, 'ok, all into room, do not hail warder' <br />
Orruar tells the raid, 'listen up' <br />
Orruar tells the raid, 'we pop this, mobs pop and rape that bitches corpse' <br />
Orruar tells the raid, 'don't let that happen' <br />
Orruar tells the raid, 'kill them fast, and try to keep them away from the corpse' <br />
Fishlip tells the raid, 'can i rape her corpse before we pop it?' <br />
What not to do. <br />
Quarken says, 'Hail, Sharalla`s warder' <br />
Ok explantion of the above. You enter the room kill all adds and have everyone spread out about the room. You hail her warder mobs pop and try to defile Sharalla's corpse, Dont let them! <br />
<br />
All four tasks have been completed. You should return to Durgin and inform him of your success. <br />
Hooray your done! well not really.. Go tell durgin your progress and the boss spawns. <br />
<br />
Your expedition is nearing its close. You cannot bring any additional people into your expedition at this time. <br />
<br />
Durgin Skell says 'Fantastic work, friends. I'm not sure how, but you have accomplished the impossible by ridding the Menagerie of the most horrible abominations imaginable. You've done a great service for the brotherhood. I'm sure Morden will reward you handsomely for . . . Wait, what was that noise?' The caverns tremble and fragments of ice rain down like hail. A deep, thundering roar rumbles from the northeast. 'Oh dear. It sounds like our work is not quite finished. I'll just . . . wait here if you don't mind.' <br />
<br />
Boss: Laskuth the Colossus: Located down the North passage: 2k hitter, he is on Ice with a pit area behind him so watch yourself. He has a proc targeted on Tank thats a Banish, Have your tanks fight for agro. He also Reflects spells 25% of the time. (Crystal Shield). And AE's Ice Rain. The ae is only negative 150 and should be resisted or partialed. Rip him apart loot his note, Return to Durgin and recieve this message. <br />
<br />
- Durgin Skell smiles broadly, 'The Wayfarer's made the right decision in sending you down here. Your courage and skill clearly mark you among the most capable adventurers in the known world. With the multitude of dangerous beasts put to rest here in the menagerie, we can all rest a little easier. You've done the brotherhood and all of Norrath a great service, and we are in your debt. <br />
You say, 'Lirprin sent me' <br />
Durgin Skell sighs, 'There's no need to mince words Dalnoth. I have no quarrel with Lirprin, but unfortunately the reverse is not also true. The man is undoubtedly angry with me. He will never forgive me for courting Sharalla and does not realize that it was her choice. She loved me, and not him. His paranoia and overbearing attitude, and eventually the outright abuse of his leadership position merely pushed her away. Now that she has fallen in the valiant service of the Brotherhood there is no further need for his insecurity.' <br />
You have confirmed Durgin's innocence. <br />
Hopefully once you zone in and look at the map the locations mentioned will make sense to you. <br />

Has anyone spoken to Diggins since getting 1.5? Does he have anything more to tell us about Velixite? What about the other dwarves there (or elsewhere, if that doesn't work)?<br />
<br />
Phrasing about Longarm would make me want to look for him off Norrath - Luclin, PoP, old planes, OoW? Although the wayfarers dont' have a presence off Norrath, that I can think of. :\<br />

Beach fight is 1 good grp doable, did mine with clr,sk,bst,dru,mag and me, we did it a bit 'free style' druid kited some, bst and mag petted others, and I tanked too some to get em off Lairyn, cleric was low on mana because of extra healing around sometimes, and Lairyn ran close to 20% hp too because late tag out ... other than that it was pretty easy ... named was easy too, no AE ... I was fastest on tag him out Lairyn and tanked for some seconds until SK took aggro .. pierced max 1k on me not much hp ... around 1/3 - 1/4 renux one</div></div><hr />

The last letter I received from him was written in a desperate scrawl.  His tone was fearful and angry, which isn't like him at all.  He spoke of shadows and hearing voices in his head.  I'm afraid he may have done something rash.  Something horrible.  Don't let his frail appearance fool you, Sanam.  He's from the same blood as Nedaria and very powerful.

I hope someone else found more about 2.0, but I got that same info from Smith just after doing only Gunthak event, it seems just having 1 or 5 done you 'open' this dialog, probably some design flaw .. seems more logical to be 'opened' only after all 5 done .. anyways good to know in advance so we know we need get some Velixite, from somewhere or crafted (in this case I expect recipe to be given somehow, as most epic only recipes were given by NPCs) and a 'similar blade' probably drop of a high end zone mob.<br />

I lean more towards it dropping off of a mob. My reason being that, if we could create / work velixite, then why need Smith Dandi.<br />
<br />
As far as the &quot;similar blade,&quot; this to me means we need to find/kill the person hinted at in 1.5...we need to get the real blade that our 1.5 was an approximation of. Then Smith Dandi will take that and the Velixite to make us our epic 2.0.</div></div><hr />

The fact that we have to do a EF LDoN might be the bottle neck, we did the Pally epic v2 LDoN (this raid is a nightmare if you dont have the right strat for Valdoon) it might have just put everyone off epics forever! lol<br />
<br />
Im also guessing that a lot of the people working hard on rogue epic v1, are not near Anguish access, and therefore arent really striving for epic 2 atm.  Infact, if you look at the abundance of OOW daggers, a lot of people might be drooling over those instead.  So perhaps we have had less motivation to go for epic 2's.<br />
<br />
A lot of guilds will have been working hard on Anguish and the flagging process also, so theres just a few reasons.</div></div><hr />

He spawns 4 adds now that hit 2k. and they are Mezable. They despawn/respawn during intervals of his life, I believe Rampage is single now he has the same dd's and he starts ae snaring at 50%. Rest is same I believe. I proved Durgin's innocence and I will be posting a Spoiler for the expedition soon. I have slacked hardcore on that but ill write it up soon.  Until then if you have any questions or want to discuss this shoot me a tell im on Vaz.  as of right now this is the best way to describe this quest -&gt; :banghead<br />
Yes I wrote this at 5am sorry ahead of time</div></div><hr />

<br />
hugz Atwa :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalnoth_Vaz</div><div class="date">11-26-04, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things:.. ok well this turned into more then 2.<br />
1.) We can stop looking for Velaxite. The reward for killing polar kraken fits smith Dandi's needs. She now just needs a replica of Fatestealer.<br />
2.) Even though redoing this thread seems nice atm, I think we should leave it as is until the quest is solved so we keep the integrity of anyone's ideas. Something said now may not make any sense but further down the road it might be a worthy clue.<br />
3.) Myndrall: The EF raid spawns a chest with only ONE loot. Yes this pissed me off too not much we can do about it. However the loot was decent it was some haste gauntlets almost identicle to the ones that drop in MPG Raid trials. Same with Polar Kraken, although I think the kraken dropped sleeves I cant quite remember.<br />
4.) Wren and Keetra are still missing, Please keep your eyes open.<br />
5.) im still slacking and need to post EF Walkthrough i just want to make sure my info isnt totally wrong because I didnt get hit by alot of the effects/mobs in there.<br />
6.) Any questions still feel free to tell me in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalnoth_Vaz</div><div class="date">11-27-04, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">***WARNING THIS CONTAINS A SPOILER***<br />
<br />
Everfrost LDON For Epic: Miragul's: Frozen Nightmare.<br />
(Disclaimer: All of this is to the best of my knowledge)<br />
ok first of all I would highly recommend all 36 people for this expedition, I believe shamroc put it like this, It is &quot;uncheese-able&quot;. Also thanks to shamroc for telling me how to kill the skeletons from the 7th circle of hell.<br />
On another note the expedition has 6 mini-events including the boss fight I am going to run through them now. But before here is some General info.<br />
<br />
- Everything Sees SoS. Upon zone in about 10 mobs will rush your group. Trash hits for 900 slowable/mezable. They are spiders. Recommended way of dealing with this: Cleric with DB up zones in gets agro then calls the raid to zone in if DB wears off use Bestow DA, It is instant cast time. Another thing, All LDON raids have a Death Limit of 36, im not positive this does but I can say its a safe assumption. Make sure YOU as in, The rogue this is for talks to Durgin and nobody else. There could be some invis flags.<br />
<br />
- After the spiders you move out through the first hall and Trigger an Event. I'll nick name this the ring of Zurg.<br />
<br />
- Ring of Zurg: Split your raid up EVENLY into 2 teams. (That means tanks mez's slows dps and heals evenly spread) Call them Team A/B. When you move out of the first room a goblin will run off down the left side. DONT GIVE CHASE. The goblin will spawn the ring event. 2 raid leaders pop and you start getting zurginated by little green goblins Ignore them. Team a goes left and team b strait find the raid leaders and kill them asap. Keep in mind you cant clear the area's or you will be ported out because the goblin horde successfully zurged you.  When the script starts you get this message - It must be an ambush!  An army of ice goblins are pouring forth, rushing in from every direction.  Judging by the cacophony of shrill voices echoing in the distance there are many more on the way.  Their leaders must be nearby . . .<br />
So, Recommended Strat for this. Dont wait for the script to start before rushing. Have a pally/sk in each Team lead the train to the raid leaders (Team A. left: Team b. strait) with harmshield/da up. Rush and engage the Raidleaders, (They dont hit hard) burn them down asap and as soon as you get them dead the goblin horde will stop rushing you and retreat. (Depop) Once the raidleaders are dead it isnt over, You must kill all the spiders you had to train there.<br />
<br />
- Next you plow to Durgin Skell, Hail him and follow the prompts he will give you his story of how his adventuring party has been slain, And he wants you to perform 4 tasks for him. The tasks are their own mini event.(text of durgin to follow)<br />
You say, Hail Durgin Skell.<br />
Durgin Skell gasps with surprise. 'By Morden's brown beard, thank goodness you've come! I'm the only one left alive. I was able to duck away and hide during the chaos of battle when it became apparent that we were in too deep. My party members were not so lucky, as each was slain by the denizens of this frozen nightmare. We must end the reign of madness in this place and exterminate the [monstrosities] that have killed my brothers and sisters!'<br />
<br />
- Task 1: The blob, In the room past Durgin there is the blob. This would be mini event 1. There is also alot of adds in the room and surrounding. DONT AGRO THE SURROUNDING ROOMS. Have a warrior rush with fortitude and engage the Blob in the middle of the room then have everyone else run in. Use knights/other war's to peel the mobs off the Tank. make sure to kill the Adds first.<br />
Stats on the blob(a sundering sludge is his real name btw!):I wasnt getting hit so dont ask me how hard he hits ! if I had to guess i'd say oh... 1500! , When you kill him he splits into 4 other mobs named &quot;a severing sludge.&quot; All are mezable. Kill, *ONE AT A TIME* . When you kill one it splits into 4 more mobs named &quot;a slippery sludge&quot;. All are mezable again kill those 4, and then Proceed to kill the severing sludges one by one. killing the adds they spawn.The sludges Flurry.<br />
After the final sludge is killed you get this message.<br />
<br />
One of the four tasks has been completed<br />
<br />
- Task 2: The Skeletons of Joy. - I can't even begin to describe how retarded this ecnounter is, so lets just get down to Buisiness. (Remove all damage shields and have your knights, who will be tanking the 4 skeletons remove their weapons before doing this) The skeletons Durgin Describes are 4 skeletons called &quot;A chromatic skeleton or An Icy Skeleton&quot; they hit for like 1100. Pull them and get them in a corner with 4 knights on them. Kill them one by one until they are all RED. Then beat the red ones down to 1% and have your wizards blast them with a PB - AE and Earn your badge of Gayness, Once they are destroyed -<br />
<br />
Two of the four tasks has been completed<br />
<br />
- Task 3: The bone Golem (I know I can't think of a witty comment for this one sorry) Marrow the Broken regards you indifferently -- looks like it would wipe the floor with you!<br />
- Strait forward fight. Golem Rampages, Its AE. Kill the Golem, He spawns adds. kill the adds as they spawn, and you should be ok. He hits for 1800. <br />
<br />
Three of the four tasks has been completed<br />
<br />
Check your progress with durgin at this point to make sure it looks like this.<br />
<br />
Ah, you found a way to put the chromatic skeletons to permanent rest. Your ingenuity never ceases to amaze me.<br />
From the bits of dust and bone on your armor I can tell you have successfully handled Miragul's splintering bone golem.<br />
Well now . . . I see you have destroyed the splitting sludge. Quite an annoying pest, isn't it?<br />
<br />
- Task 4: Protects Durgin's love. This is a unique encounter, Because you can fail it and still Accomplish the task. You (As in the rogue) should be the one to Hail, her warder.<br />
 I'll Humor you guys and let orruar explain this.<br />
<br />
Orruar tells the raid,  'ok, all into room, do not hail warder'<br />
Orruar tells the raid,  'listen up'<br />
Orruar tells the raid,  'we pop this, mobs pop and rape that bitches corpse'<br />
Orruar tells the raid,  'don't let that happen'<br />
Orruar tells the raid,  'kill them fast, and try to keep them away from the corpse'<br />
Fishlip tells the raid,  'can i rape her corpse before we pop it?'<br />
What not to do. <br />
Quarken says, 'Hail, Sharalla`s warder'<br />
Ok explantion of the above. You enter the room kill all adds and have everyone spread out about the room. You hail her warder mobs pop and try to defile Sharalla's corpse, Dont let them! <br />
<br />
All four tasks have been completed.  You should return to Durgin and inform him of your success.<br />
Hooray your done! well not really.. Go tell durgin your progress and the boss spawns.  <br />
<br />
Your expedition is nearing its close. You cannot bring any additional people into your expedition at this time.<br />
<br />
 Durgin Skell says 'Fantastic work, friends.  I'm not sure how, but you have accomplished the impossible by ridding the Menagerie of the most horrible abominations imaginable.  You've done a great service for the brotherhood.  I'm sure Morden will reward you handsomely for . . . Wait, what was that noise?'  The caverns tremble and fragments of ice rain down like hail.  A deep, thundering roar rumbles from the northeast.  'Oh dear.  It sounds like our work is not quite finished.  I'll just . . . wait here if you don't mind.'<br />
<br />
Boss: Laskuth the Colossus: Located down the North passage: 2k hitter, he is on Ice with a pit area behind him so watch yourself. He has a proc targeted on Tank thats a Banish, Have your tanks fight for agro.  He also Reflects spells 25% of the time. (Crystal Shield (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4137&amp;amp;source=Test)). And AE's Ice Rain (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4136&amp;amp;source=Test). The ae is only negative 150 and should be resisted or partialed. Rip him apart loot his note, Return to Durgin and recieve this message.<br />
<br />
- Durgin Skell smiles broadly, 'The Wayfarer's made the right decision in sending you down here.  Your courage and skill clearly mark you among the most capable adventurers in the known world.  With the multitude of dangerous beasts put to rest here in the menagerie, we can all rest a little easier.  You've done the brotherhood and all of Norrath a great service, and we are in your debt.<br />
You say, 'Lirprin sent me'<br />
 Durgin Skell sighs, 'There's no need to mince words Dalnoth.  I have no quarrel with Lirprin, but unfortunately the reverse is not also true.  The man is undoubtedly angry with me.  He will never forgive me for courting Sharalla and does not realize that it was her choice.  She loved me, and not him.  His paranoia and overbearing attitude, and eventually the outright abuse of his leadership position merely pushed her away.  Now that she has fallen in the valiant service of the Brotherhood there is no further need for his insecurity.'<br />
 You have confirmed Durgin's innocence. <br />
Hopefully once you zone in and look at the map the locations mentioned will make sense to you. If someone wants to edit a map for this ill be glad to include it. Any Corrections PM Me, I'll edit this.</div></div><hr />

You take the alloy combine it in the box and return it to the Larithim, he gives you back  Strongbox Half Full of Velixite (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=52342) This meets smith dandi's needs for for Velixite you dont need to go find the other half. <br />
Heres what the text looks like up to this point, <br />
 From the freezing depths of iceclad, you have recovered a lump of Velixite alloy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cutebutton</div><div class="date">12-15-04, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Checked with Lirprin today.  There is a new line in the text about Keetra.<br />
<br />
Lirprin, Head of Affairs says ''Keetra the Lost' is right.  She was simply 'Keetra' until we discovered her uncanny knack for straying off the beaten path.  We couldn't travel half a mile without having to double back to find Keetra.  You don't want to know how many times we sent a search team to locate her sorry hide.  What I need to know is, was this simply absent-minded disorientation or was she feigning ignorance, trying to escape?  I'm inclined to say it was the former, but with this war on the horizon we can't be too careful.  Having another thief slip out of sight is not something we can afford to ignore.  The last place she was reported as being seen was the Bloodfields.  If you find her, drop my name.  Let her know Lirprin sent you and see if she can explain where she's been.'<br />
<br />
<br />
Had a quick look around in Bloodfields with a ranger, but didn't see her.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalnoth_Vaz</div><div class="date">12-18-04, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres the rest of it -<br />
<br />
Keetra the Lost - This entails a ring event in The Bloodfields,  Head there and check the cave that leads to RCoD for &quot;a reclusive girplan&quot; (1750, 55) approx spawn loc. Killing this girplan that has (looking for name) gflux 1500 ae and hits for 1k'sh will start a ring event, Once you kill this girplan another look alike will spawn in another cave in the zone so have at tracker with you, possible spawn loc's for this guy after you start the event is (SW 100 1000),(NW near zone in on top of the castle gate,  1370 neg460 is entrance to cave he spawns inside) ( NE neg 15 neg 1150 - this is where the named spawns) (1750, 55 RCoD Cave) After killing 3 or 4 Reclusive Girplan's a named will spawn in the  NE Cave, bring about 2-3 groups for this to be safe. I need more solid info on the named spawn please if anyone could PM the info so I could edit it in here I have to be honest I wasn't paying much attention when I did this. After killing the named keetra the lost pops in the back of the cave drop lirprin's name and she will give you a flag and depop, a chest then pops with a $$ loot. <br />
Now to explain the use of the horn parts.<br />
(Don't hate me if I told you to farm horn parts I had to and did not know a reclusive girplan was part of the script, I figured this out because Caller Donivin would only talk to a 1.5 epic'd rogue, he would tell all others to take a hike =p )<br />
If a reclusive girplan is not up he may be summoned via &quot;Caller Donivin&quot; A Dragorn near  Kragsmash at location neg 570 neg 1145. If the girplan is not up hand him the 4 horn parts which can be farmed in the Bloodfields &quot;A brass Mouthpiece&quot; &quot;Thin Leather Straps&quot; &quot;Polished Bone Horn&quot; and &quot;Bucket Mute&quot; any mob carrying one of these items will have a lightsource making them glow lightly. <br />
Note the named mobs from Spawning the Girplan through the quest is diffrent but both spawn keetra if a flagged rogue is in the zone.<br />
(More info coming... I posted this part as soon as I could confirm untriggered version did indeed spawn keetra)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalnoth_Vaz</div><div class="date">12-22-04, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok,  sorry about the slack been a rough week. Heres the last of it, Enjoy. (Great storyline worth reading start to finish even if you don't plan on doing 2.0!)<br />
<br />
Go talk to Lirprin after proving all the others but Wren Simsy innocent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lirpin, Head of Affairs listens patiently to all you have to say. 'That clinches it! Wren Simsy is our girl. All the evidence points to her - the attacks on Lairyn, illusion masks used to coerce information from the rogue guildmasters, her open disdain for everything we stand for. I should have known from the beginning that she was up to no good. If only we had seen it sooner. There must be a pivotal member of the Dragorn's society that she plans to assassinate. Go immediately to this individual and warn them of what is to come. Travel lightly, no more than a small group, lest we tip our hand and force Wren to take immediate action. Hurry, Dalnoth. She must not be allowed to plunge us into open war!'<br />
The member Lirprin references to is in the Ruined City of Dranik, Behind the bridge keeper before you go into the back left tunnels looking at a map, His name is Daignal the Revered. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Daignal the Revered<br />
Daignail the Revered says ' Greetings, Half Elf. Don't Worry. I will not make any aggressive actions toward you. Look around. Do you see the bars, the guarded exits? This is a prison - a comfortable location but a cage nonetheless. I am only guilty of [one crime], but the repercussions are serious. It's likely that the reminder of my life will be spent in closely guarded captivity.<br />
You say, 'What crime?'<br />
Daignal the Revered lifts his chin proudly, 'My crime? Simply being who I am. Daignal. A Dragorn with the will to do what is right for my people, the might to destroy my enemies in battle, and the respect and reputation to call hundreds, if not thousands, of fellow Dragorn to my aid. The legions of Mata Muram have wisely decided to cage me rather than make me  [into a martyr] and face an uprising. No one, lincluding me, wants that.  It would be valiant but futile attempt to thwart their control over this world and succeed only in generating a catastrophic body count. I've already sen enough bloodshed to last a thousand lifetimes.'<br />
(At this point you can continue hearing his stories, which I did not do, or you can  continue the script.)<br />
You say, 'An assassin plans on killing you Daignal'<br />
Daignal the Revered shakes his head. 'No, I don't think that would happen. There are guards on all sides and no single person could get past them and then stand up to my might. Even if you had a mountain of proof, I'm afraid your theory has no grounds in reality, friend.'<br />
(After he gives his little speach Wren who is a shadowman wielding a fatestealer pops, and  assassinates him while you can do nothing but watch.)<br />
Daignal the Revered cries out in pain.<br />
Wren Simsy - Quads 2200 + Has 2 summoned shadowed assassin's from the gunthak encounter. They hit for 1000 FAST. This is a very tough encounter, You can not use more than 4 people, or like Lirprin said you will tip Wren off to your coming and she will have an army there as soon as she kills Daignal, This is a pretty strait forward fight bring the best cleric enchanter and warrior you know and best of luck to you.<br />
(Of course there has to be some of the what &quot;Not&quot; to do!)<br />
I thought I was gonna be slick and bring 3 groups and just Burn Wren down... Look below. <br />

The wench dies. <br />
After this VERY rough battle, Loot &quot;Wren's Fatestealer&quot; (Not on lucy yet the bot was down when I did all my epic stuff) This is the look alike Smith Dandi needs, Hail Daignal the Revered after.<br />
 Daignal the Revered is struggling to keep his eyes open, 'Well done, Dalnoth. Of the thousnads of battles I have observed in my days, none have ever fought more valiantly than yourself. You should . . . get out of here before someone finds us like this. . .  War will come. It always does. Turmoil . . . Is life's one constant. It is inevitable. Don't . . . worry. You tried.'<br />
- The reason 6 people are in my group in case you were wondering, is because I had a raid of about 40 people there killing the shadowed men from my failed attempt earlier that day... they do not despawn.<br />
<br />
Return to Lirprin, although he has nothing new to say, Talk to Smith Dandi. you recieve this message, and get flagged to loot &quot;A Globe of Discordant Energy&quot; from anguish.<br />
Your progress report from smith dandi should look like this.<br />
<br />
[Thu Dec 16 22:23:45 2004] You say, 'Hail, Smith Dandi'<br />
[Thu Dec 16 22:23:46 2004] Smith Dandi wipes her sooty hands on her apron and smiles at you. 'So, it looks as if you'll need the services of Smith Dandi once again.  I was hoping you'd stop by soon so we could talk.  Fantastic work clearing the names of those innocent Wayfarers.  I knew them all personally and they weren't bad folk.  It's a shame Lirprin can be so quick to judge.  Now, something tells me you're looking to get that blade of yours improved.  Let's see if you have what we need. . .'<br />
From the freezing depths of Iceclad, you have recovered a lump of Velixite alloy.<br />
You have slain Wren Simsy and recovered her blade, which courses with discordant energy.<br />
Smith Dandi is unable to duplicate the enchantments on Wren's weapon without a source of discordant energy. (This is the Globe from Anguish, once you get this message you have the &quot;Flag&quot; to loot it.)<br />
Once after receiving your globe Return to Smith Dandi and Hail her, it should look like this<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Smith Dandi'<br />
Smith Dandi wipes her sooty hands on her apron and smiles at you. 'So, it looks as if you'll need the services of Smith Dandi once again.  I was hoping you'd stop by soon so we could talk.  Fantastic work clearing the names of those innocent Wayfarers.  I knew them all personally and they weren't bad folk.  It's a shame Lirprin can be so quick to judge.

From the freezing depths of Iceclad, you have recovered a lump of Velixite alloy.<br />
You have slain Wren Simsy and recovered her blade, which courses with discordant energy.<br />
From the deadly realm of Mata Muram himself, you have recovered a source of discordant energy.<br />
Smith Dandi says 'Seems you're all ready to craft the blade.  We'll need the Velixite alloy, the weapon I crafted for you last time, an example of someone else's weapon that I can use for a reference, and a source of pure discordant energy.  Show those items to Lirprin and we'll get started!'<br />
<br />
-Go to Lirprin hand him, The Globe, your Fatestealer, Wren's Fatestealer, and the Velixite Alloy.<br />
<br />
Lirprin, Head of Affairs reluctantly accepts the materials and passes them to his assistant.  Though she is obviously unnerved at the sight of the pair of blood-stained daggers, Smith Dandi begins work immediately.  She unseals the strongbox containing the alloy and applies the Velixite directly to the hot coals of the forge.  Her back to you, Dandi hammers away at the metal, sparks flying in all directions.  Crackling bolts of electricity spike from the discordant globe and arc to her hammer and she strikes blow after endless blow.  When the job is completed, she looks completely exhausted.  Smith Dandi hands you the blade and gazes at you with pleading eyes, 'This weapon is pure poison, chaos, and destruction.  While you've done much to help us and I want to trust you, I can't help but worry.  Please, promise me you will not use it for dark purposes.'<br />
You receive Nightshade, Blade of Entropy, Which Identifies as &quot;Bringer of Death and Chaos&quot;(Pic below)<br />
http://www.trialityguild.com/t-img/news/q/20041216/Nightshade,%20Blade%20of%20Entropy.jpg<br />
Talk to Lirprin and Smith Dandi after everything is all said and done to find out how this all ends.<br />
Lirprin, Head of Affairs says 'We're done now, no more favors. my obligation to assist you has been fulfilled. If I can be completely frank, Dalnoth, I no longer have the stomach for thsi job. I've compromised so many of my morals, I've lost touch with what's truly Important. I've lost touch with who I am. Would my guildmaster be proud of what I've done? Do I even meet the standards of a paladin anymore? 'He sighs, 'To hell with the Wayfarer's! I'm tending my resignation as HEad of Affairs and returning to my people, who truly need me.'<br />
Then talk to Smith Dandi,<br />
Smith Dandi greets you, though her typically cheerful disposition has been replaced by a somber one, &quot;Hold tight to that dagger, Dalnoth. You might need it soon. There are rumors of war on the horizon . . .' <br />

<br />
After triggering the event there are...<br />
<br />
4 waves of 3 mobs, with no downtime. After the 4th wave, Krill the Blackbleeder spawns.<br />
<br />
Wave mobs were hitting 600-800ish max, non mezzable, I believe necro said non snarable.<br />
<br />
Krill the Blackbleeder hit the tank for 1000-1600ish - was dead in about the time it took Duelist disc to run out.<br />
<br />
We did this with Paladin, Cleric, Enchanter, Necromancer, Monk, Rogue<br />

<br />
The untriggered version is Myrhee the Flighty.  Level 75. Hits for 1600ish, has super regeneration and that same DD/knockback AE.<br />
<br />
Confirmed that he spawns Keetra even if no rogue is present.<br />

Bring lots of healers and DPS.  As stated before, his regen is spectacular.  He also memblurs, so everyone WILL be taking damage.  His room has a couple spots where he can hide inside the wall making doing anything to him impossible.  I brought 14 people (Anguish geared) and after being totally bored through the 5 girplans, thought he would be the same, but hitting a little harder and with a little more HP.  His AE goes off a LOT.  Myrhee 1, Rarrob 0...</div></div><hr />

I was hoping i could get ahead and start my 2.0 by doing some stuff by myself but it seems like its not as complicated as 1.5 and I just need to win these 5 raids.<br />

<br />
P.S.  You don't need to lose your epic 1.5 when you get your 2.0.  Smith Dandi gives you a replacement Fatestealer if you hail her when your old one is on a corpse.  So die, hail Smith Dandi while naked and get a duplicate Fatestealer, die again and leave it on your new corpse.  Get your first corpse rezzed and do the turn-in for your Nightshade, and then loot the duplicate Fatestealer from your second corpse.  You'll probably have something better to use in your offhand by the time you're at this point, but it's still fun to keep if you've got space burning a hole in your bank.</div></div><hr />

Smith Dandi is unable to duplicate the enchantments on Wren's weapon without a source of discordant energy. (This is the Globe from Anguish, once you get this message you have the &quot;Flag&quot; to loot it.)<br />
Once after receiving your globe Return to Smith Dandi and Hail her, it should look like this<br />
<br />
<br />
Just looking for a confirmation on needing flags to loot Globes in Anguish.<br />
<br />
My guild is just starting there and the original plan was to do raids for people after they were awarded a Globe, it would be a shame if we get there and nobody can use them. (Is it the same for other classes?)<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BjartBeartooth</div><div class="date">05-17-05, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in any order do:<br />
- ef ldon<br />
- shadowman ring in dulak<br />
- kraken in ic<br />
- girplan in bloodfields<br />
<br />
once those done go talk to lirpin and check your flags then you can do the last fight in rcod<br />
<br />
give the fake dagger from last fight, the alloy from the kraken, your 1.5 and anguish globe to lirpin for your 2.0</div></div><hr />
