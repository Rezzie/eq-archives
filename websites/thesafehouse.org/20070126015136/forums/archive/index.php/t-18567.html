<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazbuk</div><div class="date">05-02-05, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I was in Lake (somethingortheother) in a contested area. Being level 37 I basically sneaking around killing....no killing isn't the right word. I was ganking lots and lots of level 15-30s alliance in that town by the lake.<br />
<br />
I gotta tell you. This was my first time doing such a thing and it really was fun. Is it wrong to do such a thing? I don't think I killed anyone more than once, but I did it without worry or harm to myself. After doing all this I got no dishoner and even grouped a level 22 rogue with me to sit around and collect the honor from my kills.<br />
<br />
I'm a firm believer that there should be dishonor. I guess I'm torn between making a political message that there should be dishonor and having fun sneaking around and being all roguely. <br />
<br />
It finally took a level 60 hunter to show up and track me down before I knew my fun was over.<br />
<br />
This shouldn't have to be the state of PVP. I'm not proud of what I did all though it was really really fun. What are you thoughts of the current state of PVP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larlana Lavode</div><div class="date">05-02-05, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say revel in all of your fun.  Did you camp anyone's corpse?  Didn't sound like it.  Did you repeatedly kill someone over and over again?  You said you didn't.  So there shouldn't be anything to worry about.  If you are thinking along the lines that you were able to sneak-up on someone and kill them, then I would put your fears to rest since everyone else can do the same thing back.  It's called alchemy, to say the least.  You can make invis potions, though they only last for about 15 seconds, and thus they could sneak up on you just as quickly.<br />
<br />
What about the hunter ability to feign death?  Sure looks like they are dead, and even makes you target something else, such as their pet.  That's just one of their tricks, and it's all fair.  How about a mages ability to keep porting away?  Again, one of their tricks that we don't have.<br />
<br />
Naw, you should enjoy the feeling, because there will be times when it seems like nothing you do is right and you continually are dying.  Sometimes it's luck, sometimes it's your ability against another player.  And there's nothing wrong with the fact that you attacked them while engaged with a mob since you don't lose XP when dying to a mob, unlike EQ where you do.  If that was the case, then I would say that's &quot;dishonorable&quot;, but from what you have said, you did the horde proud.  :-)</div></div><hr />

If you were playing alliance, I would say stop playing the game on easy mode and reroll horde.</div></div><hr />
