<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_JCPanacea</div><div class="date">08-14-03, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the info form www.eqspoilers.com for those without a flashlink account:<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;b&gt;Maestro&amp;lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
- Hits for up to 1030 per attack.<br />
- Procs a 1500 hit point lifetap.<br />
- Unslowable<br />
- At 75% health hands will spawn that are clerics and will heal Maestro. Have some back up tanks prepared to tank and kill these. <br />
- At 50% another wave of mobs will spawn.<br />
- At 25% Banshees will spawn that cast AE Mana Drain. You must kill these as soon as possible in order to prevent your clerics from running out of mana.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;b&gt;Innoruuk&amp;lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
- Originally spawns as a non-KOS version of Innoruuk. When you kill him it initates the Innoruuk event a couple minutes later. <br />
- Area effect knockback.<br />
- Area effect rampage.<br />
- Summons mobs to assist him during the fight.<br />
<br />
There's similar entries for most boss mobs in the game at the site. I highly recommend it to anyone with a Flashlink account, or for anyone willing to pay a couple dollars a month for eq information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maestro hits hard. Drains mana. But isnt really that hard for a level 75 mob. Yes, level 75.<br />
<br />
Inny himself would be a pushover if it wasnt for the trains coming at you from two different directions, and some of the adds have some HP to them too.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the fake Inny you start with, well, I've seen him four times now, and he was always very KoS, very red, and had no problem seeing through my SoS. Fairly small aggro area though.</div></div><hr />

Maestro's lifetap AE? WTF are talking about. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hide and Sneak</div><div class="date">09-02-03, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has been trying the Maestro event recently with about 30 to 35 people average raid level around 63.  We are in mostly velious type gear.  About half our melees have primal.  We havent managed to kill him yet, but we are getting close.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you go into Maestro's room he is facing the organ, with his back to you.  We have a bard in the tank group for MR.  Tanks were reporting a lot of lifetap resists with 500 MR.  We have been unable to cripple him.  He is unslowable and hits for up to 1030.  We engage maestro near the organ, with the casters standing to the right of the organ if you are looking at it.  <br />
<br />
At 75 percent 2 hands spawn on the organ.  Everyone drops from Maestro and kills the adds.  Cant remember what the hands hit for, but I believe it was around 400 unslowable.  The hands either proc or cast strong root.  It seems you must kill the hands when they spawn, or maestro's hp's will go no lower than 75 percent.  When we are done with the hands, Maestro is usually back up to around 90 percent hp either from the hands healing him or regen.  <br />
<br />
Some time near the beginning of the fight 3 banshees spawn and walk into the room.  They are untargetable.  At around 40 percent they become targetable.  These banshees hit for around 600.  They proc or cast mana drain and charm.  We pull the 3 banshess to the doors leading into the maestro's chamber.  The casters to the right of the piano were not being hit by the mana drain when we do this.<br />
<br />
This is about as far as we have gotten.  Do you need to kill the banshees before finishing off the maestro?  Or do we need to concentrate on the banshees then go back to maestro?  Some guildies were saying it seemed his hp were going down with the banshees just being offtanked.  I believe with that raid force we can do it, but it will take near flawless execution.  <br />
<br />
All suggestions, comments and clarifications are welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_eqsunil</div><div class="date">09-02-03, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just off-tank the banshees.  Once they go live (somewhere between 30 and 40%...been a while since we did him) go all out on Maestro.  Any melees with an offensive discipline should save it for this time, and warriors who haven't used defensive should go offensive as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sneekii Shadowfury</div><div class="date">09-02-03, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have been considering this myself. What type of CH chain did you use and why did you fail? I have a force very similiar. Also I thought there were 3 events during the battle. Is it just hands at 75? then 40% banshee's?  I like the offtankd ideal but if they are proccing charm I would imagine the tanks would get charmed rather fast offtanking. Would like a little more information if anyone has some?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hide and Sneak</div><div class="date">09-02-03, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly we failed because we were trying to figure the event out.  Searched around and never found much info really.  First we tried off tanking the hands, but seems Maestro's hp's wont move, so we switched to killing them.  We tried fighting him in the big &quot;circle&quot; area in his room, but the banshees are there and casters get hit with mana drain.  Stuff like that.  <br />
<br />
I've only seen the hands spawn at 75 and the banshees at 40.  As for cheal time, I'll have to ask. I don't remember what they decided on.<br />
<br />
Also, I forgot to mention if you wipe the event resets in like 5 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Keadaian Songborne</div><div class="date">09-05-03, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently killed him.  Here's some additional info.<br />
<br />
There is only 1 wave of hands at 75%.  We had 2 tanks on the hands and all casters assisted them, melee stayed on Maestro to keep him from regaining too many hp's.  Like the poster above, we were unable to land cripple.<br />
<br />
He has high MR but very very low FR.  We used the same chain on him that we normaly use on AoW.  His DPS seems to be a bit lower than AoW but has more spikes/fluctuations due to the lifetap proc.<br />
<br />
When the banshees become targetable, Maestro becomes immune to fire.  We had mage pets tank the banshees because pets are not charmable.  The rest of the raid burned maestro down (took less than a minute I think to go from 40% to dead).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_eqsunil</div><div class="date">09-06-03, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote:...We had 2 tanks on the hands and all casters assisted them, melee stayed on Maestro to keep him from regaining too many hp's<br />
Look at it this way. He regens a set amount of hps per tick while the hands are up. I.e., the longer you take to kill the hands (because you don't have all dps on them), the more hps he regens. His life bar is irrelevant, and keeping melee dps on him while the casters kill the hands is...superficial (like getting stabbed in the gut with a 6 inch knife and putting a bandaid on it to stop the bleeding). You're only fooling yourselves and causing the encounter to take longer from beginning to end.<br />
<br />
As for the lifetap proc, your MT should have 500 MR and resist it every time.  Edited by: eqsunil at: 9/6/03 6:03 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fight's actually kind of easy, not hard to avoid getting ramped/knockbacked, just pin him in one of the four corners of the room where you killed the inny trigger. Make sure your tank's gnomed and max shrunk  <br />
<br />
Loot he drops is pretty nice, guild's decided they're going to farm him when our good 'ole PoP targets aren't up lol</div></div><hr />

How could you know what level he is, other than the fact that he is red at 65?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Highly incorrect. at 500mr, you're gonna get tapped to the teeth still. having MT'd maestro many times... you're gonna get tapped lots   500mr just takes the bite off it. Spellshield rocks....<br />
<br />
Oh. Paladins are good. They trivialize the banshees. think on it</div></div><hr />

Don't keel all 3 of the banshees or they'll spawn again...<br />
<br />
I'll leave it up to the reader to figure out which one to keep alive...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dahij</div><div class="date">01-09-04, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hands do not heal Maestro, but either his regen is heightened when they are alive or moving DPS from Maestro to hands means he is often at 100% again when the hands are dead.<br />
<br />
Banshee's are fun. When they go active Maestro's FR goes through the roof - not immune but damn close (lure or ro still has full effect). As Twidddler said - figuring otu what they do is fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fins Macgalis</div><div class="date">01-12-04, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tanked him too.   <br />
<br />
At 500mr, you resist his lifetap every time.  It's only a -200mr modifier, or maybe -150, but it bounces right off you at 500mr.  It's no different from tanking Raex/Vindor/Carprin.  As far as other things are concerned, quads for 1k very quickly, unslowable, but no Rampage or Flurry.  <br />
<br />
Hands spawn at 75%.  Kill them right away.  Once you kill them, Maestro's health will have regenned a bit depending on how long you took.<br />
<br />
Nothing happens at 50%.  That's Terris.  Similar, but different encounter.<br />
<br />
By this time, you will have noticed the three zombies that gracefully waltz into the room and work their corners (Har har).  In between 30 and 40%, as it varies slightly each time, they will come alive.  Once AE Manadrains, one Charms, and the other sings an FR song for Maestro that greatly increases that resist.  They're not mezzable, but they are rootable, and are best kept from running around your entire raid @#%$ everyone up.  Some guilds move their force from Maestro to killing these zombies, while some simply offtank them with Knights/Druids and quickly finish Maestro off first.  Either way works, as I've done it successfully both times.  <br />
<br />
The most crucial part of the Maestro battle, however, is from when the zombies come alive.  The encounter is simply designed that way.  They're set up to create the absolute most havok so your raid is forced to finish up the fight quickly.  If you're low on dps, there's a good chance your clerics will run OOM from one of the zombie's manadrains.  If the charming zombie is left unattended, she will proceed to mass an army to turn against you.  The firesong zombie just throws your wizards/mages a monkey wrench to switch nukes, as usually fire dd's (Strike of Solusek, Sun Vortex) are their most damaging.<br />
<br />
For the ease of getting to Maestro, his loot rocks, and Tarantella is a solid offhand weapon (15/19).  The graphic is pretty shiettey though.  <br />
<br />
If you can't do Maestro  yet, don't bother with Inny.</div></div><hr />
