<br />
In an Ancient Place, in an Ancient Time. . . <br />
<br />
It's a world of magic and monsters, of dark dungeons and powerful dragons. A group of heroic adventurers has been summoned to the Archmage's Castle. Archmage Korinon welcomes the heroes, explains that he has need for their skills and powers, then sends them off to rest. &quot;We'll speak more in the morning.&quot; the Archmage tells them. &quot;Do not wander around the castle in the night. It isn't safe.&quot; <br />
<br />
In the darkest part of the night, the adventurers hear the Archmage scream. His ghostly form appears to each hero. &quot;I have been murdered,&quot; the Archmage's ghost explains. &quot;The murderer is a foul doppelganger, an evil creature capable of taking on anyone's form. It has replaced one of the adventurers and taken on the form of one of you. I have magically locked all of the doors leading out of this castle. No one may enter or leave until the spell is broken and my murderer has been captured.&quot; <br />
<br />
To capture the foul creature, you must determine the answers to these questions: Who killed the Archmage? Where? and with What Weapon? In keeping with the Dungeons &amp; Dragons theme, this edition of the Clue game also offers a special Optional Rule where players defeat wandering Monsters in order to gain more information in order to solve the crime. <br />

This is just so sad...<br />
 I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison<br />
and I went to pick her up in the rain.<br />
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck,<br />
she got runned over by a damned old train.<br />
