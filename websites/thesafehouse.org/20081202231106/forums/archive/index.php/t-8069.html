In the other thread, Qutsemnie wrote: Quote:theres a poison vendor in PoK moonlighting as a potion vendor. near the pool with the fishermen by it. the one that sales bait and fresh fish in sight of a guy that sales bat wings (go go fish rolls is why i think of it this way). above him in a room is 3 shaman looking barbarians that sale potion stuff.<br />
<br />
2 of them hail and talk bout potions. the one nearest the door however says he is a poison vendor when hailed. all his ingredients are new to me.<br />
<br />
Here's what that merchant says:<br />

Quote:[Wed Oct 23 15:07:56 2002] Ferin Lightfoot says 'Greetings, Bayler. I am Ferin Lightfoot, resident of New Tanaan and scholar in my prime. Now, in my retirement from the excitement of my former life as an adventurer-much like yourself-I am here to offer what knowledge I can in order to help those akin to my former life. In addition to basic supplies which you may need on your adventures I also carry some books which may help liven up any dull, boring spells during your travels.'<br />
<br />
I agree that this sounds roguish - particularly with a name like Lightfoot.  I couldn't get her to tell me anything more, though.  She sells torches, bandages, food, and such.  Also, old-world brewing / baking / fishing books.<br />

I wouldn't have thought that any would be a lead, but if Renux got recycled, who knows who else might have some info.  Bleed it out of them!<br />
<br />
And someone with the new 10 slot poison thingy from the new quest, try giving it to that PoK merchant that refuses to speak to anyone that is not adept at making poisons.<br />
