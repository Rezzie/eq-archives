I digged some more to find out about obtaining it.  All I could find was that it was a quest item from the &quot;Talk to Telkoranar&quot; quest.  That alone doesn't help me much.  Anyone know who or where Telkoranar is or if that is the person I need to see to start the quest?  I'm sure this has come up before but I'm new to EQ (about 4 months).  I'm loving it especially as a rogue.  We ROCK!!  I've seen some debate as to if this is even a real weapon.  So if I could get a little assistance from my fellow brothers I'd be in your debt.  Thanks<br />
<br />
P.S. are rogues unbeatable on PvP servers with the whole sneak/hide, poisons for everything, and mega damage, or not?<br />
EX: a warrior attacks you, you hit him with a weaken poison or a caster attacks you and you hit them with a mana drain, or root them and run if need be or blind and run or blind and kick their butt!  It's got to be fun I'm thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azharan</div><div class="date">06-13-03, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a quest from a West Wing of ToV dragons.<br />
<br />
The quest involves killing named drakes in HoT for symbols and killing Dozekar in HoT for a Tear.  Take the appropriate pieces to the WW dragon for the reward.  I think it's a Lendiria the Keeper quest though....At least I think I remember getting my SDT from her.</div></div><hr />

You will need high faction with Claws of Veeshan dragons to do this quest. You need 1 tear from Dozekar the Cursed in HoT and 3 symbols from other HoT named. All these are no drop however can be multiquested as thats how I got it.</div></div><hr />
