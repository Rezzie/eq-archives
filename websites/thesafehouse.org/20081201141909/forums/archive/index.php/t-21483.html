<br />
It's like it's a whole new game!  The lighting that was recently enabled helped a bit, too.  Nice to see they've discovered other colors than brown ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-16-05, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me their cities have always been awesome. It's some of the wildnerness environments (and the ubiquitous cave) that I'm not so hot on. But I agree, the addition of environmental lighting has taken things forward by leaps.</div></div><hr />
