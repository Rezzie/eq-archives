Well I was wishing you could actually have a new costume for it.<br />
<br />
So here is what I did, I made an electricity blaster, and put him in a grey jumpsuit, looks OK really, glowing eyes, you know, but what I did was put lightning on his suit but I made the lightning the same color as the suit.<br />
<br />
However in SG Mode I made it a diff color so when i switch my costume changes, looks pretty bad ass really :P</div></div><hr />

This is the before and after, unfortunately they are nighttime so a little hard to see details.<br />
