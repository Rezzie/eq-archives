<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a story of a spanishi biker who is working on one of the three european grand tours. He is a second (or whatever you call it, the person who helps the lead win). But he is presented with an opportunity to win it for himself.<br />
<br />
It's a heartwarming and very interesting story. The storytelling style was very unique and refreshing, and there was a very nostilagic feel about it that I could not pinpoint.<br />
<br />
I really recommend it, it's 45 minutes long stand-alone OVA.</div></div><hr />

But Nasu: Summer in Andelusa is a personal favorite of mine.<br />
<br />
They are making a second movie, you can see the trailer here (http://movie.id-e.co.jp/qtmedia/nasu2480-360.mov). I encourage you to check the trailer out, and if you like the trailer for the second movie, the first one is right up your alley.<br />
<br />
Watch it! This is not your moe~ stuff, comedy, or anything. It's a excellent film.</div></div><hr />
