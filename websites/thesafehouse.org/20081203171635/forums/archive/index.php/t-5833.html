<br />
Also in Velks, Human models were messed up really bad. When sitting thier knees bent backwards and they looked like goblins sitting. When fighting their bodies would twist in wierd contortions. Outside Velks they appeard to look ok.<br />

<br />
They had human models, but sounded like gargoyles and had gargoyle placeholders, so they are probably supposed to be gargoyals themselves.<br />
<br />
The screwed up humans was probably some botched attempt to fix them.<br />
<br />
But then Velks came down on all servers today.  So maybe it's fixed.<br />

Also, I too am afflicted by the fuzzy pink numbers.  It also affects the location names on my transparent inventory.</div></div><hr />

THATS IT! That is exactly what they looked like.<br />
