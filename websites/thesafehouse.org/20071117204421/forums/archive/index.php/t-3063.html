It is set in the Forgotten Realms city of Loudwater, up in the barbaric north.  The campaign kicks off at this year's Gencon Indy , and is rumored to run through the main story in 2-3 years (ed note: just long enough for them to come out with a D&amp;amp;D 4.0 version, heh).<br />
<br />
Read about it here!<br />
<br />
Are there any other people who play RPGA games here?  Anyone else going to give this a whirl?  I'm gonna play the premier stuff at Gencon this year</div></div><hr />

Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

It's pretty cool. I'm definately interested in checking out Living FR. If you have any more info about it, I'd really appreciate it.<br />
