<br />
Friend says that at level 40 and 50 his detect hidden ability gets better, and he wants to use the points to take his base stealth (for a sb) up to 50.<br />
<br />
I am telling him this is wasting his points.  Can any level 50 sb out there help us with this?  Does higher base stealth help detect hidden?  And does higher base stealth help hide you more than modified stealth?  Is the safefall at level 40 worth the 40 points if the answers to the last two questions are no?<br />

Safe Fall IV is worthless as Safe Fall III allows you to fall from the wall of any keep and take no damage. As to Detect Hidden it is currently based of your modified spec. There are no levels of Detect hidden like there are of Safe Fall. 		-Miron Quickblade, searching...<br />

What about realm rank11's +10 to stealth?  Does this mean that a base stealth of 29 can get a fully modified 50 stealth?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gaav</div><div class="date">03-26-02, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was recently confirmed that rank points and item points are independant from each other.  You can get +11 from items, and +10 from rvr, not that you're likely to ever get the 10 from rvr.  But you can count on at least 1-2 points.</div></div><hr />

I bet they tweak the benifit of resistances.  Making +resist gear become ooooooh so important....... <br />
<br />
not saying this WILL happen but if it does all those people who stopped at 39 and are using +stealth items are gonna be peeved off if the changes affect pvp as well!<br />
<br />
Im going to bump stealth up to 45-46 and use the inventory slots to increase things like  Weapon Skill,  Absorb,  Evade (when &amp;amp; if they make the fix), spell and weapon resistance, etc.<br />
<br />
EQ had a similar progression... everyone was boosting base stats and then all of a sudden they fixed resistances then the massive push for pumping resists/AC/HPs occurred.   <br />
