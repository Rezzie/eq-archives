The 5th edition rule set came out and was wondering if anyone had any views on the subject. We use the Hero System extensively because it gives us the flexibility to play any race class combo we want and the capacity to actually make spells that work.<br />
     We have a group that has been playing for 5 or so years now and have quite a few interesting characters.<br />
<br />
I have a 250 point DE Thief/War/Mage. His story is that he was a DE Wizards apprentice. This Wizard was more nasty than most and used his Apprentices as test subjects. The last experiment caused the wizards death and caused my characters eyes to turn Black on Black and enabled him to sense magic at range. But that was after several months of coma and a year under the care of his father. He ran off rather than be sold to another wizard for apprentice training. But it also causes some consternation with his traveling partners and others he meets. You can't really tell where he is looking when you talk to him face to face. He shaves his head and tells the same story but says he was captured by the DE wizard and was actually a Grey Elf before the experiment went bad. His traveling partners know better but he sticks to the story. He walks the line between good and evil pretty closely (I like to play true neutral characters). <br />
