Mage cast Pet ( no buffs on pet )<br />
start duel not letting Mage med after casting pet<br />
<br />
okie, I try to snare the pet with Serrated Dirk, ( only have 1, RB is in offhand ) took way long to proc, once it proced, He ran around in Circles till his pet killed me off, I get him down to between 10 - 20% but can never win, my reists are 120 MR / FR. he's nukes hit for 100 each. <br />
Am I at the point where isn't just lvls? I can't stay on him long enough to snare Wezy, a few wacks here and there while he runs in circles =/<br />

<br />
now i dont know about high level mage pets and how powerfull they are, but try to ignore it.  focus on the caster.  if he is running you should be able to pick him apart with backstabs EASILY.  dont just stand in front and melee away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ignore the pet (does wezy have his epic yet?), and stay on him as much as possible. A good connection helps here. A couple of backstabs and hits here and there will whittle him down quickly. He should be easy to kill because he has very low AC, can't heal himself, and doesn't have any way to quickly escape you (such as shadowstep) if you stay on him. <br />
<br />
Oh, and watch out for the flameshield. I dunno how much it hurts at high levels, since I've never played a high level melee, but I know it eats mid-level melees for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and has room left over for dessert =/. Might wanna pumice that if you can if it's giving you trouble.</div></div><hr />

If I could find away to hit Wezy while I chase him, then he wouldn't have a chance. do Poisons proc faster than SBD? I'm wielding RB and Seb dirt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Poisons always proc on the first pierce.  One of the higher snares is made from components that are all bought at a merchant if your mage friend doesn't have high poison resist you can snare him and should be able to melee him.  If he has high resists you could always poison his pet. You could also use these nets (forgot what their called) with 2 charges of ensnaring roots each.  Root pet and then snare the mage ). See ya buddy!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">04-27-01, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you dont have skill for poison, there are still a couple easily useable options.<br />
<br />
First, there is a root poison that is easily made with components from toxdil. The root saves versus poison, and I have yet to be resisted by a non bard/shaman/necro yet. It wont hold for long, but really it shouldnt take you long to kill him with an RB. <br />
<br />
Secondly, there is the snare webs that were just mentioned, although I personally dont care much for snares.<br />
<br />
Being the method you recited did not involve him buffing himself at all, his MR is probably also low unless you are on a pvp server. This brings us to option 3. In howling stones the goos drop that one charge immobilize goo. You could also try that.<br />
<br />
Holding them still is better than snaring imo, and I can normally kill off a caster inside of 6 seconds. Their pets will never be that effective. Use a discipline if you really need to, whatever is the best for your level. Maybe deadeye?<br />
<br />
-L<br />
<br />
edit: Also, dont let him controll you. You mentioned he ran in circles, dont let him. If he starts trying to, then run away, let his pet follow you. He either calls it off, or will eventually lose you long enough for you to kill the pet. Pets die very quickly, and cost you rather low amount of health. This works great on mages because they dont get mana back like a necro does.<br />
<br />
If you let him controll the fight, then you will lose. Edited by: Legna ValSharess  at: 4/27/01 11:53:28 pm</div></div><hr />

First thing I did was run up to mage, who had an air pet I believe, and just stuck on the mage. Eventually I got a bs or 2 in and the mage went down. The whole time the SK, his pet, and the mage pet were on me. They took me down 2 bubs of hp before the mage went down. Only thing i think that really helped me was taht I was outside of kael and the mage refused to run to far from zoneline so they gave me joust opportunities. In general though mages with sowed/magesowed pets are my biggest weakness if I get jumped.<br />

<br />
your gonna get owned if he buffs himself with a ds, or his pet, so your best bet is to go after the owner of the pet. G'luck if you only have jboots and he uses a sow potion on his pet, the pet will be about 20-30% faster than you running so get used to being backstabbed *evil grin* taste of your own medicine. not sure what else you could do 8) its all how bad you want to win. Glob of gooey go could &quot;immobalize the pet&quot;-root and sow yourself, hope he uses jboots. <br />

To be fair, he should have to conjure that pet after the fight has begun (while you're trying to stick him with your pokers)  Regardless, don't bother with the pet if you can help it.  Stick to the caster.<br />
<br />
Second:  You've gotta use root/snare poison in that case.  Waiting for an SBD to proc at that level is just too unreliable.<br />
<br />
Third:  Just stay on his butt.  He's gotta cast to beat you, and he has to stop to cast.  The second he stops just lay into him.<br />

He dosn't have to cast to beat him, just take advantage of the melee range bug.  I'd have to go with root poison and massive damage to the magician on this one, only way you can do it in my opinion while you're outdoors.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aerimus Shadowborn</div><div class="date">08-01-01, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On mages and pets...<br />
<br />
First off he doesn't have to cast to beat you if you are unable to hit him and the pet can work on you then you will eventually die.<br />
<br />
Another point many mages will not just run around they will try to nuke as well.  If they do then you have time to melee them while they try to cast.<br />
<br />
Depending on your class and equipment taking the pet away and killing it may or may not be an option.<br />
<br />
Basicly you have a sequence of events that goes like this...<br />
<br />
The fight begins.<br />
   You poison the mage<br />
      The poison sticks and the mage dies to a lot of melee damage<br />
      The poison is resisted and the fight continues<br />
         The mage chooses to run around in circles<br />
            You think you are strong enough you take the pet away and kill it<br />
               If your ac and dmg isn't good enough and you are hurt badly you zone<br />
               If your ac and dmg are good enough the fight continues and may go either way (rogue favored)<br />
            If you know your ac and dmg aren't good enough to have enough hp left after the fight you zone<br />
         If the mage choosed to cast while he pet hits you could go either way (mage favored most lvls)<br />
   You poison the pet (it will stick)<br />
      Mage choosed to run around till the poison wears off<br />
        You follow (go to mage chooses to run in circles)<br />
        You fight the pet (go to you think you are strong enough to take the pet away and kill it)<br />
      Mage chooses to fight with a snared pet could to either way (rogue favored strongly)<br />
<br />
What you can see from this is that poisoning the pet in any area where there is room to run is likely to lead to a similar situation as poisoning the mage and having it resisted meaning your better of poisoning the mage unless you know he has high pr.  Also you should know how well you will do against the pet becuase if you think you can take it and end up zoning it could mean your death from a nuke while you run.  Also you can see that if you can kill the pet without serious hp loss your better off doing that than if you try to fight the mage while he runs around nuking you with the pet hitting you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Thisle</div><div class="date">08-02-01, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know what you mean by the circleling thing.  Most casters dont do this, but the ones who do are smart.  It is VERY hard to hit somone doing this, but if you think ahead youll get em.  Just go into joust mode and attack a few feet infront of where they are headed.  Youll hit em everytime.<br />
<br />
Dont worry about the pet unless its the epic or rogue pet.  NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER ignore the epic pet.  That thing is bassically a newbie dragon.  It will eat you alive.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_SlickkHandz</div><div class="date">08-03-01, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok. I'm a lvl 51 mage. I dual for fun a lot of times with all types of classes. My suggestions are. If mage uses an air pet there is not much to worry about just stick on the mage, he has absolutelly no defensive spells to help him/her?, water pet's use root poison a poisoned pet will not backstab you but he can cast and the range is 150 or 200, so mage will stay in range and prey for pet to break root. fire pet.. you got pretty good fire/magic resists which are the only 2 types of spells that pet and mages have. The pet will nuke you and expect to be nuked for 170-250 so stay off range. And finally a mage's favorite against any melee.. earth pet. again your resistance is high and root will not be a problem. Ok now from my experience in dueling rogues. I'm a very sneaky and use all my tools when i can. First as i mentioned above we do not have any defensive spells. I only will dual someone in places where i can use my surroundings. Gfay wizzy spires are a great tool when used with lev. commons the lake is awesome cause i can just right click when running and i'm lev while you have to swim. once you are in water ..since i have my waterstone (breath underwater) i can nuke away and you will not be able to see me and most likely chased out of the water... second ..any dual with melee type as i caster i start the dual with the highest distance i can have preferably 200 feet. make pet, park pet, burnout, sow, damage shield him accept dual and send pet while running the opposite direction and i always try to run as far from my opponent so he looses track of where i am. that gives me time to use malosi lvl 60 has mala unresistble debuff. that will make sure you will not resist most of the roots and you will not stand a chance against my pet constantly hiting you. you might melee pet or not your choice. if you do get ready forthat 33 DS that mage casted; in other wods you will kill yourself =) or will be a very close fight against pet. while mage 200 feet away can use a lava bolt on you to quickly finish you off. If you keep resisting pet root i will simply use my surroundings to protect me . Call me evil or cheater. But IMO is just playing smart. i will use the gfay spires with lev and climb and and if you follow i will fly to other spire and you will fall hard (i know you will ..tested on my rogue ) and die. if you don't follow,  i will finish you off by nuking or even better make a new pet. btw poisons will only help you once, after that you become just another melee. Btw i do not use tactics that make you loose exp on any of the friendly duals. i just use them on some people that tick me off. On several melee duals i am able to cast several pets. Yes i like slow duals not a nuke and you dead duals.</div></div><hr />
