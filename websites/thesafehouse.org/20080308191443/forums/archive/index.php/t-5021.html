All of the templates I have read mention nothing about having a high sword skill. &quot;Here is a hand full of warnings.. Spread them out amongst yourselves...&quot; - Aidden of The Safehouse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I were making a &quot;critblade,&quot; one that used two handers, I would probably prefer the sword to the axe.  Although axes are slighly better for one shotting, their styles are just awful.  Sword styles will at least be useful from time to time.  <br />
<br />
Plus, swords just look right to me.  But sword is probably not recommended for a shadowzerk--too many good axes out there that are left hand useable, and wielding two axes with +axe skill will add more axe skill than wielding a sword with +sword skill and an axe with +axe skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gannex</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought that your axe in the offhand went off of LA skill? I wanted to be a bit unique in using two weapons, but I will not sacrifice my offhand damage suffering if this is not the case.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply Lisboa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Killingu</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are correct, LA is based off of your LA skill, but if you are dual weilding and your axe in your left hand adds to your axe skill then it is adding a bonus to your main hand. Where as if you are a sword user then the bonus to axe is just being wasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I'm referring to the fact that lots of axes add points to axe, just as nearly all swords add skill to swords.  Some axes add left axe but besides the point... assume you use a nice axe in your left hand that add points to axe.  Then you'll be glad you're an axe shadowzerk, as opposed to a sword shadowzerk (which is what I am).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gannex</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I was thinking of trying:<br />
<br />
40 stealth<br />
29 Envenom<br />
21 CS<br />
44 LA<br />
39 Sword<br />
<br />
I hate asking whether this is a viable set-up, but wasting a ton of time on another character has soured me as to what is efficient at high levels. &quot;Here is a hand full of warnings.. Spread them out amongst yourselves...&quot; - Aidden of The Safehouse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny you should mention that set up.  It's pretty close to mine. <br />
My setup is:<br />
38 stealth <br />
40 sword<br />
44 LA<br />
21 CS<br />
31 envenom<br />
<br />
In retrospect I'd say that axe would've been better than sword, and CS probably should've been left at 10.  The perforate artery was great through the 20s, but at 34 it doesn't do that much damage and from what I hear, doublefrost will outdamage a CS of 21.  It's much more fun in a group to not have to worry about position, besides getting behind the back for snowsquall...  <br />
<br />
I autotrained stealth to 24, this gives me 20 free points and 0 points left over with this template.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gannex</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I will take your advice on the Critical Strike, as Perferate Artery was the only skill I really wanted from that line.<br />
<br />
The guild I belong to is large enough for me not to have to worry about whether I am doing more damage through the axe skills, so I think I will continue along that path, because as you said before, swords just look right.<br />
<br />
I have revised my spec's to this now:<br />
40 Sword (Njord's Fury at 39)<br />
44 Left Axe (Icy Brilliance, follow-up from Snowsquall)<br />
35 Envenom (Major Lethal Venom gained)<br />
3 Crit Strike (already used, otherwise would be 0)<br />
40 Stealth (Auto-trained up to level 20)<br />
Leaves 1 point unused.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for all your responses, your advice has made a good impact upon me.<br />
<br />
Long live the swordzerker! Edited by: Gannex at: 4/11/02 11:15:45 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can, autotrain even past 20.  You could wait until level 40 if you only plan to raise your CS to 3, because you don't lose any effectiveness in groups.   Actually, I'd take your CS up to 8 (when you get pincer, which is very good until snowsquall) or to 10, backstab 2, which in theory could set up a backstab 2-&gt;snowsquall-&gt;icy brilliance chain if your enemy doesn't turn to face you before you hit snowsquall.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, autotrain enough to buy another point in envenom.  I'd still only go with 38 stealth, so you can have two more in envenom.  My fights with infiltrators so far have been pretty rough, they have high envenom skills, so you want to be close to matching theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bia Bia</div><div class="date">04-12-02, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think that the few points it takes to get to 10 in crit, its worth having a strike that breaks a blade turn and provides a small stun.  im still really wanting to go to 21, we'll see about that though, only after i've got frosty gaze(2nd chain in evade combo for left axe)<br />
<br />
currently im at lvl 37 looking like this:<br />
<br />
stealth: 25<br />
envenom: 25<br />
axe:    28<br />
left axe: 29<br />
crit :  10<br />
<br />
id have to say this guy is starting to shine, in a group i stand just infron of the main tank facing the group while stealth, as the mob runs over me i use backstab II and stun the mob then fall into chain snowsquall.  doing this will usually draw agro, which i dump with ravager,atrophy, decaying rage. then go right back to snowsqual (if the mob is even still alive).  ive got evade 5 now, and its really starting to go off quite offten.<br />
<br />
grouped the other night in spin with a runnie with pulse blade turn, between that and evade, i did quite well as a tank.  over all this class is actually becoming more and more fun the higher i get in level.  getting really anxious to aquire doublefrost and see how good that style really is.  as lisboa said, i would definately auto train as much as possible, as the lower levels tend to fly by, and you really wont miss stealth or even need it untill your ready for rvr.  i skiped the 20-25 bg and stoped auto training at 32.  it really isnt that hard to do and doesnt seem like such a sacrifice.  good luck to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-12-02, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the joys I've discovered with being a shadowzerk is being able to throw daggers.  For 18 copper I can get bronze weighted daggers which have the same range as a thane.  It's great for soloing, and will probably be for those times when no one else can pull.  My only regret is not having a lower CS (21) as those points are wasted on solo pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gannex</div><div class="date">04-12-02, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, if I did my math correctly, if I auto-train to 40, I can get:<br />
<br />
40 Sword<br />
37 Envenom<br />
39 Stealth<br />
44 Left Axe<br />
5 Crit Strike (yeah I know this doesn't do much  )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gannex</div><div class="date">04-12-02, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, that is an idea, although I don't understand this concept of bypassing a bladeturn...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">04-14-02, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">don't worry about bypassing bladeturn. Your first hit will knock it down and as a dual weild class missing a single hit doesn't really matter, IMO.<br />
<br />
But yes, Pincer is awesome. In PvE it is the style I use most.<br />
<br />
I'm an inf so this may be slightly different for blades but pincer does more damage for MUCH less endurance than garrote and AH. Plus he to hit bonus REALLY helps.</div></div><hr />
