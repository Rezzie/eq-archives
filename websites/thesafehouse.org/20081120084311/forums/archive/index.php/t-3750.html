<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Alistor</div><div class="date">10-08-03, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay,<br />
<br />
I 'searched' through the site and the Library and failed to come up with a thread covering all the right clickies that are useful to our class.<br />
I was looking for illusion stuff (which I did find in the Masks thread) and poison procs / buffs (which I found in the Laboratory) as well as self buffs, junk buffs, toys, armor effects (both clicked and worn like Mrylokar's BP or Fungus Tunic)<br />
<br />
If someone else has compiled this info, could you just point me in their direction? It's too much effort to search thru Lucy's or Allakhazam's to check usable items by class with effects (worn or clickable/castable).<br />
Examples would be: AoN for skelie illusion.<br />
Mask of War for Yaulp II self buff<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance (Let the Flames Begin...)<br />

Here's one many would fail to mention: Glowing Ball of Velium, from CC. Right-click Velium Shards, but of course, you have to be withing melee range, and I think its got a 7 second cast time, or something like that. Fits in Range, and looks like an Essence of Dol when visible(equip it last, and it will show up).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gloshen</div><div class="date">10-16-03, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also like to know of some right clicky items rogues can use.  Lodizal shell boots have a right click effect of turtleskin which gives 10 ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AsturiasAurora</div><div class="date">10-17-03, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep a Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring, an Amulet of Necropotence and a pair of Journeyman's Boots onhand at all times for their insta-click utility purposes.  Sure, gobby earring ain't all that hot these days, and the AoN doesn't give you much but a wicked lookin' backstab while in Skelly form but hey, if it weren't for Vanity, where would we be in this game?  <br />
<br />
Then there's the Myrlokar's armor.  I keep a few of those pieces onhand for kicks; If nothing else, at least they're junk buffs.<br />
<br />
The Ornate Chain armor for rogues (the Stanos' Wicked armor) has a few items in the set that are right-clicky.  The gaunts, bp and greaves pop to mind.  Gaunts have 30% haste click, BP has an ac/hp buff and the Greaves have a Sciornae Venom poison summon click.<br />
<br />
I know there's more than this, but my mind's drawing a blank this late at night</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kitono</div><div class="date">10-18-03, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the best way is to go to allakhazama's website and in the equipment fer rogues section, go by each slot 1 by 1 and then go to your edit -&gt; find and in the find box, type in &quot;effect&quot; and look for right clickies that way, it will take time but you can be assured you will get most rogue equipment clickies.</div></div><hr />
