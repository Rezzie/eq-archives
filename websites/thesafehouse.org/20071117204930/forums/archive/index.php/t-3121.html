<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cenanan</div><div class="date">10-02-03, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just started in an AD&amp;amp;D game that is taking place in Sigil, the city of doors.  I scoured the web looking for information so that I could get the background of the city.. information about what kind of people live there.. etc.  Couldnt find anything besides small personal sites with their homebrew games &amp;amp; some basic lingo.  I know enough now that the next person that calls me a berk is going to be added to the dead book, but thats about it. Even WoTC doesnt have much information about it so I was wondering.<br />
<br />
Does anybody here know about Sigil or know where I can go to find out about it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,  NIL MORTIFI SINE LUCRE <br />

Some really good atmosphere in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordOfChains</div><div class="date">10-02-03, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gots me the planescape campaign setting... 2nd edition... even tho ya can't use much of its rules for 3rd edition, the history and sociology of the place is easily adaptable...<br />
<br />
Sigil is pretty much the meeting point of the planes... everyone and everything short of deities wanders about within its confines. Doing business with Baatezu or Celestials or even a zombie or two hundred is nothing unusual.<br />
<br />
For the majority of trade/stuff to do within Sigil, one simply needs to look at the entry on &quot;Union,&quot; an interplanar city much like sigil and mentioned in the Epic Characters Handbook.<br />
<br />
Beyond the &quot;Union&quot; entry, its also important to know the politics of Sigil. Somewhere around 12 to 15 major factions operate in and around the Sigil area, each one focusing on different philosophies and life outlooks. Among these are the Mercykillers (hitmen/bounty hunters), the Harmonium (Respec' Mah Authoritah, Biatch!), The Sensates (ooo... the colors...), The dustmen (death death death death death death death death...), The Cyphers (Shoot first, think later), Indeps (Ain't got a job... AND LOVIN' IT!), The Godsmen (Workers of the world unite!), and so on and so forth...<br />
<br />
But EVERYBODY pays homage to the Lady of Pain. Nobody knows much about her, apart from the facts that she can kill you just by putting you in her shadow, keeps the gods out of town, and has a particularly insidious collection of extraplanar mazes that she likes dumping troublemakers into. She does NOT like to be worshipped, and if you even joke about it, expect to be targeted.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the town is always changing. There's a bunch of repairmen that wander around the place, performing minor fixit work 24/7 (or 10, depending on yer campaign). The city itself also exerts a limited amount of life, forming new buildings and removing old ones, and generally making it utterly impossible to keep a map for longer than a week...<br />
<br />
Then there's that thing about the portals. They're everywhere. If there's a doorway, archway, toilet, or rathole, there's a dang good chance that something will cause that particular orifice to turn into an interplanar gate. (For example, if you grunt while taking a shite on the can, while reading a playboy mag, some poor Astral Deva's about to learn the meaning of a &quot;Shite Eating Grin&quot;)<br />
<br />
This can be useful, and problematic. Useful in that you can get anywhere, anytime, just by knowing where a particular portal is and what activates it; and problematic in that you might end up going to hell... for walking under a bridge while whistling dixie.<br />
<br />
Any more questions? 'Cuz I'm Psycho Like That...</div></div><hr />

I know now that i need to pick up a copy of the game or the book.. otherwise this could be dangerous and painful pretty quick.  Thanks for the info on the factions<br />

<br />
I always envisioned Sigil being the 'living city' as mentioned above.  Tis why I thought it would be a perfect city to do whatever you want with in your campaign.<br />
<br />
But it seems my meger knowlage of the subject is lacking so Ill step out with just &quot;Check the Maunal of the Planes&quot; comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">10-03-03, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can get the Guide to Sigil for $40 at Noble Knight Games :P<br />
<br />
probably cheaper on ebay though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordOfChains</div><div class="date">10-03-03, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just get the Planescape Campaign setting for 2nd Ed. Should be relatively easy to convert over. And prolly costs about 10 bucks now...<br />
<br />
Planescape dwells mostly on sigil and the factions, but it also has separate books for the Astral Plane, Interplanar Geography, how the planes affect magic, what happens when yer stupid enough to die, and the kind of critters that'll kill you if yer stupid enough to let 'em, such as Brain Rats, Githyanki, Astral Behemoths (BIG whale), Githyanki, Yugoloths, Githyanki, Demons, Githyanki, and did I mention Githyanki yet?<br />
<br />
And to summarize every single dang thing I've said: It ain't a setting for the average happy-go-lucky adventurer. He/She is dog meat in Planescape, yo. 'Cuz I'm Psycho Like That...Edited by: LordOfChains at: 10/3/03 12:50 pm</div></div><hr />

100% agree.<br />
<br />
Planescape is the best campaign setting   And they majorly messed it up in 3rd. <br />

<br />
And not just for the info on Sigil, but because its probably the greatest story ever told in a video game. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perosnally I use both Sigil and Union in my campaigns. I use them to ofset each other. Sigil is the 'city of chaos' ruled by the fearsome lady of pain. Union is the city of law, ruled my the Mercane merchants guild.<br />
<br />
You can get some intresting stories if you use them against each other.<br />
<br />
As far as where to look though... Planescape old 2nd ed books are godsend for color text and info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">10-18-03, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wanting to stab my eyes out rather than play more Diablo, I finally reinstalled PS:T (previously i loaded in game, talked to you know who, and quit because i was tired and the resolution threw me.)<br />
<br />
I just played it about 21 hours straight. <br />
<br />
I never liked the 'city' parts of the baldur's gate series, though I know most people loved them. Part of the reason why I couldn't play bg2. I never fully cleared BG in BG1, despite mapping every inch of the wilderness. Adjusting to playing in a city was a pain. Travel kind of sucks, but run makes running between maps easier.<br />
<br />
There have been a few tedious parts, but it was probably due to my play style (super conservation of resources.) In fact, I know it was. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
(spoiler removed as best as possible.)<br />
Edit: The best part is that the npcs are all so apathetic. An example that holds true throughout most of the game that I've seen: At one point, I decided to kill someone who controlled passage through a certain place, rather than give him money. Upon returning, I found he'd been replaced, and I was told that because he was missing, I couldn't use the passage.<br />
<br />
Five seconds later, the replacements are running screaming through town as I chase them down like dogs, and the citizens just ignore it.<br />
<br />
Repeat this every time I need to go through said passage, in either direction...<br />
<br />
It got rather tedious, but I was glad I didn't have to employ the baldur's gate method of &quot;use cloak of 32000 charm charges to brain-rape the entire zone and do shady dealings under cover of mind control.&quot; Edited by: Prenn at: 10/19/03 12:53 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other thing about PS:T I love is that its the first time in that genre that I wanted my main character to be a pure wizard.  Those high level spells are just so damn awsome looking when you cast them! &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">12-05-03, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main recommendation for Planescape books is as follows:<br />
<br />
Planescape Campaign Box<br />
Planewalkers Handbook<br />
Uncaged: Faces of Sigil<br />
The Factol's Manifesto<br />
<br />
Those are the basics.<br />
<br />
And don't pick up Faction War unless you're looking for the end of Planescape as it's known (It screws up all the existing material and they never made any new material to replace it).</div></div><hr />
