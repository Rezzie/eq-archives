<br />
**Patch Day**<br />
<br />
Greetings everyone!  <br />
<br />
Today's patch contains some changes that we are sure everyone will enjoy:<br />
<br />
- Canned emotes (e.g. /point) now work on NPCs.  In addition, the range for canned emotes has been increased.<br />
- /who all &quot;guildname&quot; should now work for players who have /roleplay turned on.<br />
- Preferences for the mouselook will be saved in your options file.  Those who turn mouselook off each time when starting EQ will only have to do it once more.<br />
- The &quot;Chat Filter&quot; tab in &quot;Options&quot; now has an option to filter messages caused by damage shields hitting others.<br />
<br />
*Fast Drop*<br />
<br />
Our most exciting change today is an option that allows players to avoid accidentally dropping items on the ground.  The new client allows players to set &quot;Item Dropping&quot; preferences on the &quot;General&quot; options tab.  The three options that can be set are:<br />
<br />
- FAST DROP: Items are dropped without confirmation.<br />
- CONFIRM: A confirmation box will be displayed whenever you try to drop an item.<br />
- NEVER: You are not allowed to drop items on the ground.  <br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can also set these options using the /fastdrop command.  The arguments are:<br />
<br />
- ON: Same as option &quot;Fast Drop&quot; on the General Tab.<br />
- OFF: Same as option &quot;Confirm&quot; on the General Tab.<br />
- NEVER: Same as above.<br />
<br />
Please note that whatever your setting, coin will always be dropped without confirmation.  Additionally, the FastDrop option only applies to items being dropped upon the ground.  Handing items to NPCs will still work regardless of your FastDrop setting.<br />
<br />
It is highly recommended that you use option &quot;CONFIRM&quot;, as GMs will not reimburse any items that are accidentally dropped.<br />

Does that mean that I can now just use say /rude sir lucan rather than the old /rude sir_lucan00?  Kinda nice if that's the case.  I always enjoyed playing around with mobs I was sneaking up on but for generics it's a pain especially when you had things like a_spectral_keeper44.<br />
<br />
WOOT on the /who all guild!  That's about time, now I can clear out half my friends list to put my actual friends on it (er not to say that my guildmates aren't friends  ).<br />
<br />
The drop thing's gonna be nice for bards, really nice for em too, no more dropping weapons/instruments in a fight.<br />

<br />
Before Patch:  When target was out of range, our &quot;you cannot see your target&quot;, you had to wait a full refresh cycle before you could throw again.<br />
<br />
After Patch:  You can now immediately throw after getting this message.<br />

Do a /who all GUILD, you will not get anyone with the /roleplay tag on. According to Ester over on the whineplay boards, it was miscommunication with the person who wrote the patch message, and it will be fixed next patch. <br />

I like the item drop thing, I'll be more encouraged to swap items in combat now.<br />

&quot;Patch Changes<br />
Oops. Sorry, I knew I forgot to mention something. Indeed, ranged weapons will no longer use their full delay when you are not capable of using the weapon due to being too far to too close. <br />
<br />
In addition, we also stealth-fixed a problem with skill-caps on poison. They not correctly to up to where they should.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, good news times two here.  It is not just thrown weapons, but all ranged.  And our poison caps have been increased.  All in all, a fine patch it seems...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really this is a rather nice patch. nothing negative (cept the /who, but mistakes are expected) `Go away. I don't care where. Just go. Very far. Far far away.`<br />
