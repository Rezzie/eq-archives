<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-03-05, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today Sigil began the full roll out on their second starting continent, Qalia, as the days to E3 count down. Based on an Arabian Nights theme, Qalia is a land of scorching deserts, active volcanos, and ancient empires sunken into the desert. Included in the roll out is a new front page, new lore stories,  an .mp3 of the music for the Nusibe Necropolis, by the very talented Todd Masten (http://www.vanguardsaga.com/downloads.php), in addition to a bevy of new information about available player classes, races, and insights into the design plan for Vanguard.<br />
<br />
Some tidbits, which you can find further information on at the Vanguard home page, and the recent article by Gamespy-<br />
<br />
-Psionicists as a playable class, featuring unique methods of advancement.<br />
-The existance of Gnomes in Vanguard(Glip is relieved to know he exists.) I hesitate to call them a playable race just yet, as it hasn't been officially announced or demonstrated. <br />
-Details on the economy and layout of the capitol city of Qalia, Aghram (check out the fabulous concept art drawing by Christian Piccolo, which was my favorite of the new batch, even above the game screen shot). <br />
-Insights into the dynamics of character growth and exploration that will be present in Vanguard.<br />
<br />
E3 gonna be fun this year :)</div></div><hr />
