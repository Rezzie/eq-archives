There's going to be a marathon running of Living Arcanis at comicon that pretty much runs through all the mods out so far.  I think Arcanis is an awsome world to RP in, and anyone looking to get into it can play the entire first year's story line 7 rounds I think, at 4 hrs/round) in sequence.  If anyone's interested, you can find the character creation information, among other things, here.<br />
