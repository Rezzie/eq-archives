I dueled a buddy of mine who's a lvl 23 wood elf warrior. I'm lvl 23 myself. He's fully twinked out and I'm almost geared up in full RS too. (except Helm and boots) We dueled in HighKeep at the Lookout/guard area and I must say that although I lost it was a really fun experience for me. We both learned alot from each other in combat terms. In the beginning he was gaining the upper hand and I thought I was going down like a sack of potatoes but after I got my act together he was amazed at the speed I moved and the amout of BSs I landed. But alas, I had not done poisoning yet and I'm sure that would have turned the tide in my favour. Towards the end of the battle he landed a few crippling blows and I was cut down by one of'em so suddenly. I was glad I got him down that much and he was hoping that my Blood Claw wouldn't finish him! Hehehe! Well, I just wanted to share this with those who don't even think of dueling. Dueling is a fun thing if done with a friend. Many people think of duels as a form of settlement to a disagreement. I say, go out and duel a friend, Its fun!   &quot;Beware the shadows that you see!&quot;<br />
&quot;For one day it will be me!&quot;<br />
&quot;Before you turn, Before you track,&quot;<br />
&quot;I'd have left a knife in your back!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Better yet.. after you've played on a PvP server for a month or so head on back to a blue server and try a duel.<br />

Rogues were meant to be on PvP.<br />
