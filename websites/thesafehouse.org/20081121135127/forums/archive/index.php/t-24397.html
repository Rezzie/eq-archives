<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is the Cowboy Bebop movie as an introduction to the series.  I'm looking for movies to influence a certain someone that Anime can be really good.  I think she'll dig the series, but the concept of &quot;hey lets watch this 20+ hour series, then you'll see what I see&quot; just doesn't seem like it would fly.<br />
<br />
I guess the related answers would be good too.<br />
<br />
What Anime movies would you recommend as an introductory to anime as a genre for adults (not hentai loving adults).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not good in my opinion.  THe movie takes place towards the end of the series.  You can still watch it as stand alone but it would be as big of an impact if you havent watched at least half of the series first.  If I remember correctly the movie takes place two or three episodes before the end of the series.<br />
<br />
Introductory anime?  Depends on their likes.  Youd definatlly want to pick a topic they like or you'll loose them right off.<br />
If you pick Ghost in the Shell and they dont like Sci-Fi shows for example they may not want to watch anymore thinking its all like that.  Most people dont realize that Anime is a Artistic Style more than a Genere.<br />
<br />
Anything by Miyazaki would be a GREAT start.  Heavy stories with moral compass that are just as good to vege out and watch.<br />
Ghost in the Shell would be Deep, thought provoking, and have some decient action.  Gets into a realy thinking show but you can still just sit back and appreciate the art.<br />
Kiki's Delivery service or something like that would be cutsy.  Show that theres a cute side to the Style.  May not be a good choice for a first impression if you are trying to convice her that its not all &quot;Kids Shows&quot;<br />
For a romantic twist, you could put in Ah! My Goddess to watch with her.<br />
<br />
You could always just start with the first episode of Cowboy Beebop and see what she thinks.  If she gets into it she may want to see what happens next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since she's a 'she', I'm guessing sci-fi might not be the best place to start.<br />
<br />
The first two I'd suggest would be Spirited Away (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/) and Princess Mononoke (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119698/) (both are Miyazaki films), in that order.  Spirited Away is an excellent story with beautiful visuals, and you can throw out that it won an Academy Award.  Princess Mononoke is more violent (some limb dismemberment and decapitation), but has a good voice cast and good visuals, and each character has their own realistic motives for their actions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah I was figuring on Spirited Away as a first choice, I've misplaced my dvd though.<br />
<br />
Also yeah on the Miyazaki(sp?) films in general.  My local independent vid store has the studio gibli (or at least did a few years ago) import collection with Totoro, Kiki's, Mononoke, etc.<br />
<br />
I also thought about GITS too.<br />
<br />
Most of my anime movie watching has been more action/sci-fi (Baoh, Vampire Hunter, various hentai/adult) with the exception of the miyazaki films.  I actually think she would really really dig miyazaki's Dance of the Fireflies but because it is so far outside the 'norm' for anime, I'm afraid it would turn her off to the more standard fare.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any good steampunk movie animes?  I've seen one movie in that genre but it was so-so imnsho, can't remember the name of it.<br />
<br />
I'd love to get her into FLCL, but it's so far out that I think I need to build her up to &quot;sure sounds weird&quot; from the current &quot;anime?  bleh&quot; mindset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That Miyazaki collection is a pirate DVD collection, so its quality not necessarily the highest.  They compressed two or three movies on one DVD and occasionally a voicetrack is entirely missing from a movie.  <br />
<br />
I think she could start off at FLCL if she is emo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TorchTheDresser</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say it would work very well as an introduction to the series. In fact, that was the case with me. After I saw the movie, I tuned into Adult Swim everytime Bebop was on. If she can't appreciately how utterly cool Spike is after the movie, then I doubt she ever will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My &quot;If you don't like these I'll never bother you about anime again&quot; threepack is Spirited Away, Grave of the Fireflies, and Perfect Blue (or Tokyo Godfathers if the subject has a tolerance for subtitles).  <br />
<br />
I like to hit the other genres before the guns 'n' boobs action stuff, you've got to be careful about solidifying an opinion that anime is all adolescent male fantasy (if you're lucky, if you're unlucky she thinks its Japanese schoolgirl porn).  It doesn't matter how deep Ghost in the Shell is if they quit paying attention after seeing Kusangi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ill have to agree with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerda Jurtafryde</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw the movie first and loved it, so I picked up the series afterward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also agree with Cowboy Bebop being a pretty good introduction. Not that much is lost, only if you're anal, which new fans are not.<br />
<br />
But since she's a girl, may I recommend Whisper of the Heart? It's a wonderful romance and fantasy story between a young boy and girl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bebop's one of those that, at the end of the first episode I wasn't sure, and at the end of the second I was in love.  I'm not sure how it would be if I'd seen the movie first.  But honestly, if she sees a couple hours' worth of Bebop and doesn't like it, dump her before it's too late and she sucks out your soul. <br />
<br />
Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is another possibility.  It's so different from most anime.  No giant robots, no aliens, no goddamn-monsters-we-just-finished-rebuilding-Tokyo-Tower-yesterday.  I'm still trying to figure out why it doesn't suck.  <br />
<br />
Also, in KimiNozo's case, you can show her the first two episodes, then inquire real innocently whether she's sure she wants to see any more.  Heh heh heh heh heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />

I really liked Kimi ga Nozomu Eien a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't matter how deep Ghost in the Shell is if they quit paying attention after seeing Kusangi.<br />
<br />
Ya, thats true.  Kusangi is rather distracting. :naughty<br />
<br />
I cant beleive I didnt think of Tokyo Godfathers.  Sheesh.  Its like the anime version of &quot;Miracle of 34th Street&quot; or something.  But it is subtitled so theres that.<br />
<br />
Grave of Fireflies may make her Cry though.  That movie can really hit some people if they're not expecting it.  That being the case however it may also be a good choice to show how diverse the style is.<br />
<br />
And I still suggest Ah! My Goddess for a couple. :b<br />
<br />
<br />
Kimaguire Orange Road is intresting school romance with a hint of Psionic's thrown in.  At times you watch it and forget the main character's family is even psychic.  (He's psychoportive but his releitves have other powers)  I can be rather fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well tried Cowboy Bebop, but we were in bed and got distracted early on.  Will have to try again another day, on the couch.</div></div><hr />

Not sure, but yesterday I received an e-mail stating my orders for Kino's Journey and Saikano box sets have been shipped out and are on their way, so hopefully I'll know next week :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Millenium Actress was a beautiful and touching show. Definitely highly recommended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Godfathers was my favorite, but hell, get all three and make it Satoshi Kon movie night.  You can do a lot worse.</div></div><hr />

Millenium Actress was really good as well but I still end up suggesting Tokyo Godfathers.  If you sister it up with Grave of Fireflies first its similiar animation but it really cheers you back up from the slump of GoF</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">05-18-06, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well we watched Bebop and while she wasn't blown away by it, she enjoyed it (though fell asleep towards the end).<br />
<br />
She said that it (anime in general) is beautiful, but that the dialogue is just so crappy/camp and that the women always seem to wear exotic outfits...:crazy<br />
<br />
So as an introduction for her, I'd give it a 6.<br />
<br />
Gonna try with the miyazaki films.  Thank you for the other suggestions.  Is Ah My Goddess really only like 5 episodes long?  That was the info I found on some anime site, but I didn't look deep for information.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Ah! My Goddess Movie (Stand alone movie. VERY pretty artwork.)<br />
 <br />
Ah! My Goddess TV - 26 episodes (take the oav, the movie, and the manga; put 'em in a blender, and you get the TV series.)<br />
Ah! My Goddess Second Season TV - Incomplete, still airing original episodes in Japan</div></div><hr />

Hehe at first i didn't like the first eps of CB :P. It wasn't till much later that I saw the greatness that is CB :P.<br />
<br />
But Ah!MG is good for romance ppl heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">05-18-06, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't you guys think that Ah! My Goddess is too otaku to be a gateway anime?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-19-06, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about that. Not that I'm going to debate Ah! My Goddess being an otaku anime, but Cowboy Bebop was too in the same sense (time it was shown was late night).<br />
<br />
However, it has many things going for it: There are no skimpy outfits, it's a sweet romance story, extremely minor fanservice (or at least, not the type of fanservice an ordinary fan would notice).<br />
<br />
While some argue that Belldandy plays a stereotypical submissive female role, Keiichi also devotes himself to Belldandy, so I don't think it's a one-sided thing. Unless the girl watching is extremely feminist, I don't think she would miss that.<br />
<br />
If a romance is to be had, I'd also recommend Kita~e ~Diamond Dust Drops~, which is called Diamond Daydreams in the USA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
/agree with the first thing hehe.<br />
<br />
But yes she is a bit submissive female role in AH!MG...but look at Ai Yori Aoshi. She was really submissive imo heh but i guess its more of an extreme AH!MG. Not that it was bad....I really enjoyed Ai Yori Aoshi for romance as well but it might be considered &quot;Otaku&quot; maybe.<br />
<br />
Edit: The first Ai Yori Aoshi not the SS heh.<br />
<br />
Edit2: Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is still prob my fav romance type anime heh. But its not out yet =(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">05-19-06, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, I would have mention that AYA but theres just abit to much Fan Service in that one compared to AH!MG.  Once you get her &quot;Otakuized&quot; to the fan service it would be a good one to move onto though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">05-19-06, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, I would have mention that AYA but theres just abit to much Fan Service in that one compared to AH!MG.

<br />
Ya =/. Kinda too bad tho they didn't need to put that much into it either...would have been good even without it =(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">05-19-06, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And miss out on Tina's Boobie Checks? :b<br />
<br />
Yes, its not the only series that would be just as good without the fanservice.<br />
Mezzo Forte is another that comes to mind.  Two scenes in the whole movie are Hentai scenes, the rest are LaFemme Nakita type of show thats kinda cool to watch.  If they took those two scenes out then the the whole thing would be 16+ or something like the Series following it &quot;Mezzo&quot; was</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-19-06, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's already got one strike against him; when it comes to women and anime, it's usually two strikes and you're out.  The first step is to make her a Miyazaki fan, not an anime fan.  If she likes Miyazaki then get her to try other anime, but first you have to get her hooked on Miyazaki.<br />
<br />
Her 'exotic outfit' comment was most likely a polite way to say &quot;Faye Valentine dresses like a streetwalker&quot;.  She's got on a top to flaunt her breasts and her thong is hiked up over her hips.<br />
<br />
The next anime should be Spirited Away.  If she doesn't like that she'll never like anime, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">05-19-06, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well she's not so off-put by sex and scantilly clad women, so while I agree it was a comment about Faye's attire, I don't think it will always be a problem.<br />
<br />
I agree though, gotta get her to Miyazaki fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">05-19-06, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spirited Away is basically Neverending Story for adults (and kids too).  If she doesn't like that then break up with her.</div></div><hr />
