<br />
is recruiting late night players!<br />
<br />
Sacire Nox was started to give people working 2nd shift or anyone who likes playing late night a place to meet others of their time frame and choose a server to start on. I know from experience it can be frustrating to play on a server that has few people on outside of prime time hours. So stop bye and sign up if your interested in putting together a solid guild of late nighters! The site was just recently started, and recruitment just began so bare with us as we get started. Intended guild raid/group times are expected to be around 1am EST or 10pm PST</div></div><hr />

Just a friendly reminder that Sacire Nox is still looking for late night players on Targonor. Unfortunately after launch many members were dissatisfied with the game and have stopped playing. The guild is still going and is looking to build our numbers up again. Please visit the link posted above if you are interested for additional information. We're looking for members L15+ mainly since those who stuck it out have been leveling up, but we will consider all apps.</div></div><hr />
