I just started putting points into stealth, as I have read that in RvR if your stealth is below your lvl you can get picked off easier by other stealthers. Which comes to my question, what are some of the SB templates that are most common out there, and how should I plan to spec planning mostly for RvR.<br />
<br />
I was thinking Sword, Stealth, and Crit maxed, but what about envenom, Should I neglect my sword a little, and instead place points in Stealth, Crit, and Enveonom primarily and Sword as a secondary?<br />
<br />
Just a lil cofused.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">03-21-02, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, my understanding of it is like this.  In the past, people observed that having above 2/3 your level really didn't benefit you against higher level players.  Someone who was level 20 with 20 stealth could be seen as far away by a level 35, as someone with 14 stealth.  I infer from this that 2/3s stealth is just as effective as higher stealth on same level players. People maxed out their stealth anyway at high levels.  <br />
<br />
Now with the patch that made detect more hidden effective, that stealthers can find someone same level with 6 or so stealth from max fairly easily.  6 stealth from the max means the same level assasin can detect you from 6 horselengths away.  When you are pursued by a stealther, you'll be close enough to him after you stealth that you can't escape.  <br />
<br />
Anyawy, I still think at low levels you don't need any stealth and would be better off autotraining (too late for you).  I started training stealth at 24, I could've waited to 28 in retrospect.</div></div><hr />
