<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maximilean</div><div class="date">05-03-01, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had a few people go LD on me while I was fighting them.  It's never been that big of an issue, at no time did linkdeath lead to super-hitting characters wiping me out or anything like that.  In each case, for various reasons I've not finished the Linkdead character off.  But, interestingly, I've had complaints that I continued to attack (unknowingly) after the character went LD; nuking at long range, for example, before noticing the linkdeath.<br />
<br />
I was very confused when I got /tells like &quot;Thanks for the nukes you kept dropping on my head after I went LD.&quot;<br />
<br />
In one case, on the advice of the zone, I zoned myself rather than finish off a yellow dwarf I was in the process of winning against after he went LD.  <br />
<br />
Now, I wouldn't go attack someone ordinarily if they had a AFK or especially LD tag just sitting around, but in my opinion, once battle is joined, linkdeath just means bad luck, you die.  Is something wrong with this?  I would think if linkdeath meant &quot;disengage,&quot; this would get constantly exploited by people who can't handle defeat.<br />
<br />
Basically, I got a very divided opinion when I asked zones about this.  A lot of &quot;hardcore pvpers&quot; (   ) were very much in agreement with me that LD was just rotten luck, you die. And yet a lot of other folks thought fighting LD players under any circumstances was unethical, and the non-LD player should zone. (?!?)<br />
<br />
Am I crazy?</div></div><hr />

Kill them.  They suffer no exp loss.  In many cases the LinkDeath is self imposed to avoid looting.  Do not trouble yourself about it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ceescrit da Bossalini</div><div class="date">05-03-01, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shortly after word got around that when you go LD in PvP, your now computer controlled avatar can do 2 things:<br />
<br />
1) Hit, and chain cast spells, like an NPC (ie, hurt much harder than a PC)<br />
<br />
2) Cause EXP loss if they kill you.<br />
<br />
<br />
... all of the sudden a new trend develops.  If you attack somone that either isn't ready, oom, doesn't feel like fighting back, etc. all they have to do is reach down and pull their phone cord, or simply /q out of the game.  This is one of the newest &quot;greif&quot; tactics in PvP, and I don't tolerate it.<br />
<br />
Heard a couple things on this one.  When somone actually does go LD (bad luck, ISP), they will &quot;blink out&quot; (dissapear from view, then pop back up with the LD flag on their head.  If they purposely /q out of the game, they will just immediately  display the [LD] flag next to their name, without &quot;blinking out&quot; first.<br />
<br />
Either way, I have no ill feeling towards killing somone that goes LD DURING PvP combat. Most of the time, its a matter of life and death (exp loss).  I would never purposely attack and try to kill somone with the [LD] flag, if I hadn't already engaged with them though.<br />
<br />
As far as /tells like &quot;Thanks for the nukes you kept dropping on my head after I went LD.&quot; goes, that is utter BS.  How the hell will they know whether you continued to nuke or not AFTER the fact that they went LD?  Sounds like another poor, bluebie, excuse and trash talk spew that I hear everyday when I attack somone that doesn't feel like fighting back, or PvPing that day.  Same as somone that instantly sits down and goes /afk as soon as they are attacked.  The whole time they continue to sit and say &quot;AFK AFK AFK&quot; while being killed... my ass.  Go ahead, petition me you bl00b, see if I care.  If you go AFK on a PvP server, without hiding yourself well, or having somone look after you, you just might get killed.  Its happened to me, and I never bitch.<br />
<br />
I have over 500+ PvP kills since day 1 on this server, and must have been /petitioned more than 100 times.... still no official warnings or suspensions on any of my characters. [b]Ceescrit Bossalini<br />

I just asked him what he thought of people who would exploit the game like that, and he just kept bitchin at me,  I guess he didnt get it. Diabalein Avidya <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wotan</div><div class="date">05-04-01, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed that a lot of players seem to legitimately go LD during a fight.  Something to do with the battle spam I suppose.  That said, I've lost count of the lamers that do this repeatedly and intentionally.  Some guilds on our server, you can count on it like clockwork.  I will generally finish the fight unless I think it is unintentional.<br />
<br />
Very foolish tactic IMO.  You are counting on the goodwill of your opponent not to take the opportunity to easily xp you himself.  <br />

So I figure it's the same when someone yanks the plug.  So if they LD during the fight, I need to take em down for my own good.</div></div><hr />
