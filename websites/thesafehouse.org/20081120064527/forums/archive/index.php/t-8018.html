Paralyzing I . II . III on my test were no longer 95 % snare 50 % slow on target ..<br />
It seems 70 to 80 % snare coz mob still moving not that slow like being rooted ( root = 100 % snare )<br />
and the message changed also . After u use ur Paralyzing poison , the message was the same wtih Muscle Lock poison ,<br />
not the old Paralyzing poison message anymore .<br />
<br />
after many many patch ..<br />
about one week ago .<br />
I test Paralyzing poison in Arena with guildmate again .<br />
about the 95 % snare :<br />
I m sure it's no longer 95 % . ur target is able to move faster than the old Paralyzing one but still at least &gt; 65 % . (Dru epic , Nec epic , Dru AE snare all can not take hold while ur poison on ) it looks like 70 to 80 % only now .<br />
about the 50 % slow :<br />
my target is poisoned by my Paralyzing III , then enc / shm do slow on my target again but my poison effect didnt worn off (enc / shm slow is &gt; 50 % ) at that time<br />
another try .<br />
enc /shm slowed my target first .after my target slowed I success did my Paralyzing III on my target again . message didnt show my poison effect can not take hold . my target still poisoned by Paralyzing III .<br />
after all the test ..<br />
I m confused that do we rogues still have any poison can slow our target ???<br />
anyone noticed the Paralyzing I II III changed ???<br />
post here if u have some experience to use Paralyzing poison in this days plz...<br />

Used Stiffening Ergot and then the shaman cast slow.  It didn't overwrite the poison and then it wore our a little later.  <br />
<br />
Well, I suppose that means that there are no more slow poisons.  Poisons suck as it is... did they have to go and make it worse??<br />

They have always worked with the shaman/enchanter/ranger slows. They do not add together, nor do they over write one another, its just that the most effective slow takes precedence.

<br />
Paralyze I is the same slow and snare as Paralyze III, just lasts 40 seconds instead of 120...<br />
<br />
Considering that the best use for rogue slows is to land one ASAP and give the shamans time to land their better slows, 40 seconds is fine as a duration. Jules, 60 pal<br />

Shimmering / Glimmering Drakes.<br />
<br />
Those have the annoying attribute of being unslowable by shammy slows.<br />
Poison is the only way for us to slow those and the fights lasts longer than 40 seconds (we aren't uber). They usually die within 10 seconds of Paralyze III wearing off.<br />
<br />
But re-applying every 40 seconds sucks in those encounters, imho.<br />
<br />
And yes, farming heartstings sucks.</div></div><hr />

Is it simply that the duration is shorter with P I?  Or is there also a chance that the mob will resist the PI and not as much of a chance of them resisting PIII?  <br />

Hunting Bloodthirsty ghouls in l guk, due to LD's and someone taking off unaway, it ended up being myself, a 45 rogue, and a 44 cleric.  Figured it would be a good time to try to reduce the damage taken, so was using spine break.  The difference between when it was working and when it wore off was amazing.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, I know it was answered above, but still wanted to share a time that the poison made the difference between dead group and live group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AddoPovar</div><div class="date">09-20-02, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spirit of Sloth is in the Muscle Lock family (snare without slow). Spine Break is in the Paralyze family (snare with slow, can wear off prematurely). I don't know if it is a bug or not when Paralyze poisons break early.<br />
<br />
Spine Break is a great poison if you just want to test slowing some mob, but if you want to actually keep a mob slowed, you might want to upgrade to using a Paralyze level 2 poison, named Kinetic Suppressant. You mix two delphinium with one basilisk eyestalk, in a lined vial with constrict suspension. You need to farm only the basilisk eyestalks. They are extremely easy to obtain in the basilisk caves in Jaggedpine (they drop in other places also, but that is the best spot I know).<br />
<br />
The slight extra work of gathering the basilisk sacs is offset by almost doubled max duration.<br />
<br />
Paralyze III is not worth the added trouble of farming the heartsting venom sacs, in my opinion. They seem very rare, and you do not gain much in duration over Paralyze II.<br />
<br />
Paralyze I lasts a max of 7 ticks, 42 seconds.<br />
Paralyze II lasts a max of 12 ticks, 72 seconds.<br />
Paralyze III lasts a max of 17 ticks, 102 seconds.<br />
<br />
They all slow the mob 50 percent.</div></div><hr />

spirit of sloth is NOT a slow poison. a good snare? yes. slow? no..<br />
<br />
heartsting venom sacks (in my exp. at least) are easily bought from vendors in and around cabilis... making for a real nice tier 3 slow/snare<br />
<br />
sloth is so much easier for duels tho<br />
