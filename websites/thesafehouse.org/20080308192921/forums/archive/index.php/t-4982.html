If they sprint to escape, they won't be able to hide as long.<br />
<br />
If there are a lot of people hunting them in return, they won't be able to hide forever.<br />
<br />
They would have to stay visible until they begin their attack (like WWII submarines).<br />
<br />
This would not effect the more social behavior of archers participating in Realm defense or attacks as much of that time is spent visible picking off targets.<br />

Great idea. If you can keep it Archer only this would really even out the playing field. &quot;<br />
 <br />

&quot;I dont see any reason for it to be archer only.&quot;  - Mythras  <br />

&quot;I can't imagine that an assasin would actually have any endurance left at all (at least not enough to get off their opening styles) by the time they manage to line up a critical strike on a potential victim. A change like this would be devastating to the pure rogues, but I actually think it's a pretty good idea to make sniping (and getting away with it) a bit more difficult. &quot; -Sapporo<br />
<br />
&quot;ok, lets apply a bit of intelligence here- NO ONE HAS SPECIFIED A ENDURANCE LOSS RATE, THEREFORE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSION IN REGARD TO THE RESULTANT ENDURANCE LOSS... SUCH AS - HOW MUCH ENDURANCE YOU WOULD HAVE LEFT AFTER APPROACHING FOR A BACKSTAB.<br />
<br />
FOR INSTANCE: IF YOU LOST 1 POINT OF ENDURANCE PER 100 MILLION BAZILLION HOURS OF BEING STEALTHED THEN IT WOULD HAVE ZERO IMPACT ON GAME MECHANICS.<br />
<br />
IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU LOST ALL OF YOUR ENDURANCE THE SECOND YOU STEALTHED, IT WOULD HAVE A VERY BIG INFLUENCE ON THE GAME MECHANICS FOR STEALTHERS AND RENDER THEIR ATTACK STYLES IMPOSSIBLE.<br />
<br />
IF THERE IS A POINT ON THIS CURVE AT EACH EXTREMA THEN THERE MUST BE A POINT IN THE MIDDLE WHICH PASSES THROUGH A 'HAPPY MEDIUM.'<br />
<br />
THIS POINT OF BALANCE IS OR SHOULD BE OPEN TO DEBATE - INSTEAD OF HAVING SOME WHINY PISSANTS ARBITRARILY EXCLUDE THE ASSASIN CLASS FROM THIS DECISION AND THEN IN BULLHEADED BLINDNESS CONCUR WITH EACHOTHER AND POINT THE MORON STICK AT ME, ESPECIALLY(even more capitalized) WHEN THEY BOTH HAVE DRAWN A CONCLUSION FROM WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW SUCH A CONCLUSION.... WITHOUT (even larger, bolder letters) EVER MENTIONING A ENDURANCE LOSS RATE. &quot;  -Mythras<br />
<br />
&quot;Make it so.<br />
<br />
For ALL stealth classes. Just make sure that the quantifier is appropriate on a per class basis.<br />
<br />
Archers need stealth just as much as assassins do in order to get their initial big hit off. The difference is that rangers need to travel X (where X is the range of their Critical Shot) distance less than the assassin. Multiply X by 2 (2X) and you have the extra distance that the assassin must travel in order to get in place, attack, and escape.<br />
<br />
Base Stealth Time would be the base amount of time that a ranger can be stealthed.<br />
<br />
Now, come up with a valid quantifier that allows the assassin to travel = 2X + Base Stealth Time. If they can stealth for that long, then they are on even footing with a ranger. They don't deserve any extra handouts, but they definitely need to be stealthed longer.<br />
<br />
Also, each extra point put into stealth should reduce the quantifier and enable you to stealth for a longer time period.<br />
<br />
I like this idea a lot. I do think that if this is implemented, the timer to restealth after an attack should be removed though. Since your stealth timer would already be limited, it is too drastic. In order to get away for a restealth, the assassin would need to sprint away, and by the time they got far enough away to restealth, they would be out of endurance. If that isn't changed, the once again rangers get an advantage since they can use speed burst to run without using endurance.  &quot;  Nytewynd</div></div><hr />

Considering the sometimes huge distances we have to stealth across to scout out enemy movements/position, even a very small endurance drain would cripple us, both as scouts and as assassins.<br />
<br />
No endurance (edit: under this proposed solution) = visible and nowhere to run.<br />
<br />
Our opening chain uses enough endurance that it's difficult much of the time to get away, since *most* people we kill are stragglers and relatively close to others.<br />
<br />
I agree that there is a problem with stealth + range + get out of jail free, but assassins don't have that combination.  And surely there are other ways to balance archers in that regard, rather than crippling them as scouts (not the class, the role). -- Huff McTuff, 41 Nightshade, Pendragon<br />

What I don't think people realize is how difficult it is to set this stuff up.  We are not running around gleefully wacking targets at leisure.  It just doesn't work that way.

&quot;If we One-shotted standing yellows consistently, I could understand stealth eating endurance. But I'm hard pressed to One-shot standing blues (casters), and I need that end for a decent chance to get away (this means running as soon as I PA the guy, not even finishing him off if I don't get the One-shot).&quot;<br />
 <br />
 <br />
&quot; Assassins should not under any circumstance, be able to walk into a group, kill someone, and get away. <br />
<br />
Assassins should be able to kill a single non grouped target by using CS then finishing them off with normal styles.<br />
<br />
I think Nytes idea is a good one, all stealth runs off endurance, but assassins less so, as they need to travel farther in stealth than Archers. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno   people seem to think that we shouldn't one-shot- and Mythic said all that little quote about one-shotting :<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistwolf: &quot;From Mythic's Standpoint, are there any issues that need to be address in RvR combat, that have not already?&quot;<br />
Sanya: &quot;God yeah, that's what we're working on right now. That's why this 1.48 is coming out. We really, REALLY, I swear to God, but nobody believes me, intended that, a level 20 shouldn't really have much of a shot, but a 30… should be able to at least hit a 40, and a 40 should have a shot at a 50. And stuff did not work out that way… but one of the big things we're working out right now is how to fix that, you know, so a level 35 can go into RvR and not get killed like a fish out of water.&quot;<br />
Mistwolf: &quot;Wait, you mean we're not supposed to get killed in one hit?&quot;<br />
Sanya: &quot;Noo…You're not! There should be no one-shot RvR things.&quot;<br />

<br />
I am not sure what Sanya was referring to and I hope that she was referring to no one-shot kills in the new Battlegrounds only where there is only a 5 level spread.  Otherwise, how in the heck would you prevent one-shots in the frontier where there will inevitably be level 10 players and level 50 players side by side.  Albeit, level 10 players may be exp-ing in their frontier at their own risk.  Still, you don’t have to be an assassin to one shot anybody.  Any level 50 will take down any level 10.  So this talk about preventing one-shotting really makes no sense to me.  You will NEVER be able to prevent it, and you may do a lot of damage to the game balance trying to do so.<br />
<br />
About stealth taking endurance:<br />
<br />
What a dumb idea.  I bet that the persons in favor of that idea had never gotten their stealth characters to even level 20, not to mention doing any meaningful RvR with their stealth characters.  Face it, no classes are meant to be effective against all other classes.  Archers get killed by assassins and other stealthers.  Assassins get killed by tanks and insta-mez characters and other stealthers.  It is a rock-scissors-paper arrangement that is the basis for a strategic RvR play.  What we see here is “paper” guys whining about “scissors” guys.<br />
<br />
Assassins do not have an easy life.  Sure they can one-shot grays and remain unstealthed, but hey, if you are a level 30- player dinking around in the frontier, understand that there are some risks.  You would be dead the same way from a level 45 assassin and from a level 45 character with speed and mezz.  You just won’t see the assassin coming.  If you don’t like the risk of being one-shotted, then go to BG or level in the safety of your own realm like everyone else.<br />
<br />
I challenge all who posted in favor of this silly “stealth should take down end” suggestion to try to get some assassin kills in RvR.  I am a level 45 NS with 32.5K RPs and I am just getting the hang of the strategy.  Only then you will realize the dangers from other stealthers popping after you take down your victim, insta mezzes that stop you while running away, the 10 sec restealth timer from last attack (including arrows that archers keep shooting at you), roaming guards that happen to just walk over you as you unstealth, etc.  When you get to take down 10 victims per portal run (even if gray), come back here and post exactly how you think stealth should be nerfed.<br />

<br />
But I didn't think that Assassins were too overpowered.  I also like the idea of the class giving up good armor for stealthiness and some good damage.  <br />
<br />
I think some people just haven't had the best experiences. On top of that, how many assassins are really out there? Its been hard to level my guy up this far. (Started in Febuary and just got 30 lol - I have been moving though)  Not many groups like to take us in. <br />
