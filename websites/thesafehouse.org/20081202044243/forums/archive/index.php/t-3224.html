However when my fighter equips a 2-bladed sword, the attack bonus doesn't decrease like it should when dual wielding, and it shows up as no offhand. He also appears to only have one attack / round. Does anyone know if this is, in fact, broken? Or what.         Krimzan Anklestabber<br />

I'll have to find my book and check-see if it conflicts with NWN...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm only partially through chapter one, but my lvl 6 monk with 2 weapon prof and that +1 to all light weapons feats gets 1 attack per round hand to hand at +9/+6 tohit or 2 with flurry of blows at +7/+5 tohit (I assume its 7/5 since FoB says neg 2, even though the character sheet doesn't modify to reflect that when FoB is active).<br />
<br />
But when I equip 2 kama's I get +4/+1 for primary hand and +0 for offhand and 2 attacks.  with FoB active, I get 4 attacks a round, at (I assume) +2/-1 and -2.  Getting Amb and Kama Spec will raise those numbers.<br />
