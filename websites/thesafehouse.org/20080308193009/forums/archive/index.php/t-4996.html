I know this has gone back and forth tons and have seen posts where people say they dont see the difference..... or have friends that say they dont see the difference.... <br />
<br />
But have any quantifiable tests been done to validate this?  Taking the natural 50 skill vs 39 +11 skill? I haven't seen any posts that show hard tests have been done.... <br />
<br />
... its just one of those things that is nagging me..... especially when i see all the great data on our damage in CS and poisons. <br />
<br />
   i work for intel..... seeing the numbers has become a disease to my brain!!<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
I can think of only 2 tests to show quantifiable for this skill..... maybe others out there can think of more.<br />
<br />
1) A stealth sprint test (with both moving from point A to B at the same time) to see if there is a difference in speed<br />
2) Both assassins facing each other.  one takes a step back until one assassin loses vision of their target<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_NummieS</div><div class="date">03-28-02, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hell..... test would probably work with a assassin with a natural 35 vs one with 23 + 7 in bonus...... its just the 11point difference would be able to show the greatest differential.<br />
<br />
just wish I could get home to try this out but im about 100,000 miles from my PC   <br />

Anyone in China want to let me borrow their computer for an evening?   <br />

<br />
I posted, some time ago when detect hidden was changed, extensive data testing that I had done to determine the formula (which includes item and realm rank bonuses when comparing hider stealth skill to seeker level).<br />
<br />
It was in the main hall, surely long since scrolled off.<br />
<br />
But I can assure you that the game uses your stealth skill including items and realm rank bonuses when calculating stealth movement speed and detection radius of people looking for you.<br />
<br />
One thing to note is that if you stealth, then change out items and increase your stealth spec, you have to unstealth then restealth to have the benefit of the (slightly) higher movement rate.  Movement rate is calculated based on the stealth spec when you hit the stealth button, it doesn't change &quot;on the fly&quot;. -- Huff McTuff, 41 Nightshade, Pendragon<br />

If you ever come across that post or remember the formula please let me know!<br />

<br />
However, Squink raised another question in my mind.............if stealth is NOT calculated on the fly, what's to stop an assassin from dropping stealth items and equipping higher weap/envenom items while maintaining his original stealth cover?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mesmerea</div><div class="date">04-03-02, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/seconds that question...<br />
<br />
if it works one way, it should work the other way.<br />
<br />
It's only nasty when you are detected and will have to try and restealth perchance.<br />
