I think I move a bit faster with ST than snoop - not certain.  Does anyone know if snoop gives a more effective invis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">12-27-04, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed. ST lets you move faster, but with that speed comes less effective stealth. Snoop gets you past much more, and group Smuggle seems to work for me better still (though it's slower and has a short duration)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">agra</div><div class="date">12-30-04, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the moment, you can snoop and then smuggle.  This stacks the effects.  After the next big patch, smuggle will be basically worthless, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
The only reason smuggle is good is because of the stacking.  Normal smuggle is no better than smuggler's talent, that is, it only hides you/your group from greens (not blues) reliably, and certainly not whites or yellows.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've given up using smuggler's talent.  It's faster just to run through areas filled with greens and blues, and use snoop for whites and yellows.</div></div><hr />
