O = ring <br />
1-4 = spawn points <br />
D = Deathtouch mobs restricting retreat <br />
<br />
Pre-Ring information:<br />
1) Set up camp on the bridge. Stay in the middle area. Buff up <br />
properly. <br />
2) When everyone is ready, start the ring.<br />
3) ONLY one monk goes into the ring. This is the Ring Trigger <br />
(RT)<br />
4) RT stays standing until mobs spawn. RT feigns once mobs spawn.<br />
4a) If the RT dies, a Backup Ring Trigger takes his place until <br />
the RT is back.<br />
4b) RT stays grouped with a shaman to heal and a small enchanter <br />
team.<br />
5) Once the ring is clear of mobs, the RT stands again and <br />
repeats. <br />
6) Before every boss, and sometimes after as well, a CH/Gain <br />
Mana will cast on raid. <br />

.........Vulak'Aerr is rooted, so debuffs can be done before <br />

.........his AE is now disease based and can be cured<br />
<br />
The first three waves are very straight forward and simple. <br />
These should be used to practice assisting and killing drakes in <br />
a certain order. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We beat this on the second try starting with 32 people and ending with 44 or so.  We are all pre SSRA and in Tier 2/3 of PoP.  Just make sure to keep everyone in the middle of the bridge, and time your rounds.. NINE MINUTES..<br />

<br />
Also, the DT mobs seem to spawn earlier than the Lord/Ladies that despawn them.  We went ahead and started the ring anyways thinking it was bugged and they'd despawn, and a GM said that we may need to 'enlist the help of others' to kill the untargetable DT drakes and that he wouldnt assist us... /boggle.</div></div><hr />

Last time we attempted it, we got to the 7th or 8th wave, and then for some reason the untargetable DT drakes started to randomly DT people who weren't even anywhere close to them. We had like 8 people who got simultaneously DT'd for no reason, and then it just went all the way downhill from there, heh. Edited by: Rlazgoth  at: 7/25/03 1:15 pm</div></div><hr />

If you are still hacking away on wave 6 when wave 7 pops (3 flurries and adds) you will probably wipe.<br />
<br />
Btw, when you are about to wipe; run a cleric/necro out to bridge and camp/fd while rest of raid buy some time. When resser is safe all Rogues Escape, Bards Fade and Monks/SKs FD out on bridge. The script will reset and after resses you can try again from wave 1.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_HaloChanter</div><div class="date">07-26-03, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tip - don't use the above guide religiously.<br />
It has some good information, but it is far from completely accurate. <br />
The things you need to depend on are assists and quick heals. There will frequently be times where you'll have 6+ mobs in camp, and it can get hectic. Make sure you have as tank line set up - even if you have to throw some hybrids in there - and make sure your healers know who they're looking after. Get the debuffs in there quickly, stay away from the edges to avoid being thrown in to the lava by knockback effects, and set up a border (using corpses) as to give you enough space away from the DT drakes and backspawn, and enough space away from the ring, as to maintain some sort of control over the rate of mobs you have.<br />
If your guild can handle 3 flurry drakes at the same time, you should be set. As mentioned previously, the hardest thing really is wave 7 and wave 15, where you'll have 2 drakes that each split in to 11 drakes, for a total of 22 mobs. Now, you have to kill those 22 mobs before the next wave (wave's usually are on a 12min or so timer). Therefore, you're going to need some fairly good DPS, around 35 - 40ppl. If not, be prepared to handle wave mergers, and that can get messy.<br />
As mentioned in the guide above, you'll get an AE CH and mana refill after every boss, so take advantage of this. There isn't really a need to look after your mana, so let the nukers and such know this.<br />
Apart from that, it takes a total of 3 hours, but it's a lot of fun, and Vulak'Aerr himself is painfully easy. His AE is a 55% disease based slow, cureable, but the recast is 12 seconds, so very pointless. He hits for 1k, and can be fully slowed. He's rooted in the ring, and his AC and hp are quite high, and the fight takes a while. But to be honest, he'll be no challenge for a guild that can trigger him. <br />
G'luck. Some excellent items to be had here.<br />

Anyways, some of the info is a bit off due to my POV during the event when I was the ring trigger.  But I did the best I could to keep it as accurate as possible considering we only did it once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Daedrea</div><div class="date">07-28-03, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats fairly accurate except the first few waves which are pretty different but still not hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Wave 1 has four drakes and a wurm, not two drakes and a wurm.<br />
<br />
- During wave 7 and wave 13 we had carrion drakes pop on deaths.  Considering how long wave 6 can take if you try and take them all out before wave 7, it's an important thing to know.  After the flurries died the carrions seemed to stop popping on deaths.<br />
<br />
- The name of the boss in wave 8 is slightly different than what is printed, but I can't remember it.<br />
<br />
- Wave 11 is slightly different than described, think there was a racnar and two drakes.  Not sure.<br />
<br />
- One of the later wussy waves had rampaging hatchlings.  Again, can't remember which.</div></div><hr />

Do the mini-bosses drop NO DROP loot?  Our guild's loot system isn't generally arbitrated, so it takes time for people to speak up and to parcel stuff out.  I don't want to be distracted from the waves that don't stop, but if NTOV class loot is dropping on the bosses, somebody has to deal with it.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, maybe the FD person in the ring can be loot manager.</div></div><hr />

Well, if you aren't lucky and someone else cleared NToV and you have a camped out Mage on the bridge, clearing NToV to get to the Ring should get you down to max KoS anyway  <br />

<br />
Not quite true.  Back last summer when there wasn't a strat guide for this and everyone said the ring was broken, you can imagine our dps was a lot lower compared to now.  We simply split up waves like that so that we would off tank a couple drakes while the next round spawned and then get back to the splitters once the next round was complete. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_BollixBraker</div><div class="date">09-09-03, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty sure i know the answer to this question anyway, but here goes.<br />
<br />
Q. Why do we get DTed by guardian spirits?<br />
Not all the lord/ladies had spawned when we tried rov, but we had killed all those that had spawned.<br />
The DT was on those people closest to the ring itself.<br />
The raid force was halfway along the bridge.<br />
<br />
I suspect the answer is, we got DTed cause not all the lord and ladies had been killed (there were several untargetable mobs in the ring)<br />
<br />
Q2. Does someone have to be inside the ring at all times?<br />
I am concerned about failing it cause we didn't have the ring activated.<br />
<br />
Q3.  To start rov of, does someone need to speak to the herald? or do you just have to step into the ring?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any answers</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the spirits were up.  All must be gone before you can spawn the ring; meaning all the lords/ladies must have been killed associated with each Guardian.  The Guardians will sometimes spawn before their associated Lord/Lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;Q2. Does someone have to be inside the ring at all times?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Q3. To start rov of, does someone need to speak to the herald? or do you just have to step into the ring?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just step into the ring.</div></div><hr />

On wave 13, two flurrys spawn in ring, one spawns on bridge.<br />
