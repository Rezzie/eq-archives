Oh i know but if you got technical about it some of us are not even close to American otaku heh. But if we just talkin loosely then ya i guess your right :P.</div></div><hr />

Most of us here are beyond that.</div></div><hr />

SH Anime works just fine, unless we pool together and come up with something better, that most of us can agree on, that isn't stupid, or unfitting of the other forum titles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didnt originally call myself Otaku but I have so many people calling me that I catch myself doing it on occasion.  And sometimes in jest.<br />
Most of the time they insist im &quot;Otaku&quot; because I have such a large collection.  But I dont consiter myself such but I have to bow to Stalk's knowlage with great reverence. :b</div></div><hr />

Having it named Anime-niacs is pushing it though. Feel free to call yourselves anime-niacs if it pleases you though ;)<br />

I like anime but I'm no otaku not the Japanese or American version.</div></div><hr />

And we're zany to the max<br />
So just sit back and relax<br />
You'll laugh 'til you collapse<br />
We're Animaniacs!<br />
 <br />
Come join the Warner Brothers<br />
And the Warner Sister, Dot<br />
Just for fun we run around the Warner movie lot.<br />
They lock us in the tower whenever we get caught<br />
But we break loose and then vamoose<br />
And now you know the plot!<br />
 <br />
We're Animaniacs!<br />
Dot is cute and Yakko yaks.<br />
 <br />
Wakko packs away the snacks<br />
While Bill Clinton plays the sax.<br />
(or We've got wisecracks by the stacks.)<br />
(or We pay tons of income tax.)<br />
We're Animaniacs!<br />
Meet Pinky and the Brain who want to rule the universe.<br />
(or Meet Ralph and Dr Scratchansniff; say hi to Hello Nurse.)<br />
Goodfeathers flock together; Slappy whacks 'em with her purse.<br />
Buttons chases Mindy, while Rita sings a verse.<br />
The writers flipped; we have no script<br />
Why bother to rehearse?<br />
 <br />
Cast : We're Animaniacs!<br />
We have pay-or-play contracts.<br />
We're zany to the max<br />
There's baloney in our slacks.<br />

We're Animanie,<br />

They're animated ('To impart interest or zest to; enliven') maniacs ('A person who acts in a wildly irresponsible way'), as well as animation.  The title 'Animaniacs' fits the cartoon very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">05-11-06, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I wont deny that.  Its a perfect fit and before I was really into anime I didnt care at all that they were named that.<br />
But when I tell some people that im into Anime they say some comment about Yacko, Wacko, and Dot.  Its like they live under a rock or something.</div></div><hr />

But I'm definitely in favor of a different, something room-based like most of the rest of the House.  I just can't come up with anything.</div></div><hr />

And yeah, it's annoying sometimes.  They tend to bunch me into that name, as well, and I'm like &quot;k, I kinda like anime - I don't even keep up with it as much as you guys do&quot;...  sad part is I end up smelling like Otaku long before they do (cuz I'm a fat bastard, ask Aura).</div></div><hr />

In america, it's just a cool way of defining themselves.

You get the idea. I try to encourage the proper use, or rather more importantly, a standard of use of words.

Like the 96% of jackasses who are merely jumping the bandwagon, and the 4% who should know better but call themselves it anyway due to low self-esteem and the need to fit in.<br />

In other words, either way they get my scorn ^^</div></div><hr />
