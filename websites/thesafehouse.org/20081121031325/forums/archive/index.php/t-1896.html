<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaielen</div><div class="date">10-08-03, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, here we go again.  The adventure never ends.<br />
<br />
I work for the government.  I'm an accountant for the U.S.D.A.  What I do is very important.  I work the accounts for the underprivaledged farmers in the United States.  They get loans at decreased rates from us instead of getting screwed by a bank.  We also have programs in place to help them if, say, a tornado comes down and sucks up all their crops.  So, it is VERY important that I practice the utmost care and expertise when working transactions that are going to change the information on these farmers' multi-million (yes, some farms cost that much) dollar accounts.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, we, of course, generate a LOT of mail here.  So, we have a mailroom.  These employees are contractors, but they must still abide by government contract, and they must also conform to the employees' preferences.  However, some mailroom people seem to have forgotten their role as a support function.  They mail our paperwork, and they deliver the paperwork that our state offices send to us.  The mailroom employee contract was awarded to a company that hires people with MILD problems, i.e misc. medical/mental problems including but not limited to schizophrenia, asthma, bipolarity, etc.<br />
<br />
There is one woman that works down there in particular who seems to think she has free reign here in my branch...and who can also issue orders to me and other accountants about our mail and our files and also bring in misc. stupid @#%$ for show and tell.  This rant's for you.<br />
<br />
You stupid @#%$ BITCH!  So you think that bringing in the kid's toy you bought from Wally World is CUTE!  Are you a RETARD!?  Oh!  That's right you ARE a @#%$ retard, aren't you!?  You work in the mail room!  Well, listen up.  That @#% damn singing Coke can you brought in for Christmas last year and played TWENTY FIVE MOTHER @#%$ TIMES was annoying!  That idiodic singing fish was the all time winner, lady.  You know what?  I heard the fish in Wal-Mart when I walked by and pushed the button.  If I have to hear your scaley rubber bastard sing &quot;Take me to the River&quot; one more @#%$ time, I'm going to jam him up your fat bubbley ass and make sure that every time you sit down you're jamming out to one of his retarded @#%$ songs!<br />
<br />
The two God damned Winnie-the-Pooh dolls that sing to one another were annoying too!  I love Winnie and Tigger as much as the next person, but if I have to hear it again I'm going to beat you so hard you'll be begging for Christopher Robin to save you!<br />
<br />
Remember the God forsaken Furbies?  Yeah, she brought one of those in too.  I swear to God, if there was ever an annoying toy, this one is it.  With it's noncoherent, incessant babbling and every once in awhile muttering a mommy or daddy, I can understand why you like it.  It's vocabulary skills are on par with YOURS!  Bring that thing back, I want to teach it to say @#%$ YOU AND DIE YOU FAT STUPID WHITE HAIRED ANNOYING BITCH!  Go to Wal-Mart with a hundred dollar bill and see how many of those annoying things will fit down your THROAT, because that is where they are going to end up!<br />
<br />
Ohhh, how wonderful.  You've found something that plays the theme from Grease over and over and over AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER!  I @#%$ LOVE IT!  Push the mother @#%$ button a 28th time, because I didn't hear it all the other times!  You stupid worthless ninny twit, I can hear that @#%$ OVER MY HEADPHONES!  Old McDonald is going to have one seriously @#%$ UP account when I'm listening to that garbage instead of paying attention to his 2 million dollar account.  I hope to GOD I get his monthly payment right, otherwise when he comes after me with his double barrel shotgun, I'm sending him to YOU!  Show him the fish, he'll @#%$ LOVE IT!  <br />
<br />
I swear to God if you play that piece of @#%$ Grease theme one more time I am going to go to a John Travolta souvenier auction so that I can BUY GREASED LIGHTNING AND DRIVE IT UP YOUR FAT ASS!  It will FIT TOO!  What @#%$ ailment did you have to get this job besides serious mental retardation?  Cheeseburger addiction?  Take that annoying piece of @#%$ back to YOUR OFFICE, let the retard drool run down your chin, and push that @#%$ button as many times as you want!  <br />

When typing out these, I usually just type fook and get on with it.<br />
<br />
That said, another good rant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Santril</div><div class="date">10-08-03, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh. I can relate to this one completely. Working in retail, I have to clean up the toy department at the local Target at least once a week. Nothing is more thrilling than having a three year old run through the isle you just spent the last quarter hour cleaning, while his sister, two years his elder, is over playing on the electronic &quot;Dora Educational System&quot; that you can hear halfway across the store. <br />
<br />
All while listening to the same three music videos over and over. Sounds like someone took the hell of retail and brought it to your office. I'd take that crap and throw it out the nearest window.  <br />

Everything. Barney videos on a loop, kids screaming, parents whining, toys that sing, the Teletubbies, a broken electronic educator panel, etc.<br />
<br />
Everything.<br />
<br />
But I would request that that women not bring her stuff in where you can hear it, and Im sure that if you mention it to your sup theyll think the same.</div></div><hr />

Typing 'fook' where other words would get filtered detracts from the 'rage factor' of the rant.<br />
<br />
Rating:<br />
<br />
Presentation - 8<br />
Took me about halfway through the first 'rant' paragraph before I figured out what you were ranting about, but when I was done I definitely got the picture. Great use of curses and caps.<br />
<br />
Validity - 7<br />
This is something that you can and should approach her about, especially if it is disrupting your work. Definitely something you can take it to a supervisor if she's uncooperative.<br />
<br />
Rage - 9<br />
You definitely captured and communnicated your feelings. She pisses me off, and I've never met her! Your Sister in Arms,<br />

Hey, now.  Lol.  I'm not going to be seen on the news on a roof with a high powered rifle or anything.  I've found that ranting is a good way of relieving stress, or being able to reveal my Mr. Hyde if you will.<br />
<br />
Do I really come across that nutty?</div></div><hr />
