<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ceescrit</div><div class="date">12-12-00, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, since we're all PvP rogues, and most of us (VZ and TZers) take faction hit with each kill, I thought this was the perfect place to post this.<br />
<br />
This was copy/pasted from my same post on our guild's website:<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ok, I know the biggest concerns in killing others in PvP is faction. Some of us recently heard of a certain Mr. Sneakypants, slayer of darkelves, hanging out in Neriak recently. People that saw him were like, &quot;WTF? how does he do that?&quot; Well, here is goes, lets try to start a complete list of all the quests you can go, to become non-KoS in all cities again.<br />
<br />
Ak'Anon and Gnome Faction:<br />
<br />
I was KoS to all gnome NPCs in the game, now I managed to raise it to dubious, to merchants, guards, NPCs, and maybe the banker.<br />
<br />
What to do:<br />
<br />
1) Head to the mino caves and kill every Mino in sight, each time you do this, you'll get better faction with the Guards.<br />
<br />
2) Kill Every Runaway and Rogue Clockworks that you see in the Valley outside of the caves, while waiting for the mino's to spawn. Collect all &quot;Scap Metal&quot; and &quot;Rusted Black Boxes that drop from them. The boxes are heavy, so if you have a wieght reducing bag, put them in it.<br />
<br />
3) When you get non KoS to the guards, and are encumbered, head to Ak'Anon with all your junk<br />
<br />
4) Stop at the Warriors (Gem Choppers) guild first. Get a map, because Ak'Anon is confusing as hell (as are most cities in the blasted game). Use hide and sneak when you go in, and sneak behind (this gives you indifferent faction) the NPC named Manik Compolten. Hand him all your boxes and get a bunch of good faction.<br />
<br />
5) Head to the necro guild and look for an NPC named Sanfyrd. He should be standing right outside the maze that the Evil Necro and Warriors guild is in. Use hide/sneak behind him, and hand him all your srap metal pieces 4 at a time, for a crapload more of good factions.<br />
<br />
Rinse and reapeat until Indifferent or more. This should give ya quite a faction cushion to go out and punt some more gnomes around in your spare time.<br />
<br />
Ok, who's next. I'd like for Wiggo to post spoilers like this for his Red Wine (Neriak) and Muffin (Elf/Human?) quests. Also looking for easy ways to all good human cities faction.  <br />

I used to be amiable to both, but now I'm dubious to merchants and apprehensive to militia.  The only thing I've been killing is orcs/gnolls in HPH and player elves/pecks (lots o' them).  I have no idea what happened to my Freeport faction, and it's kinda weirded me out.<br />
<br />
I know easy ways to get back in good with them, but I'm more curious about what happened.  I may experiment with killing a hundred more elves and see if somehow that affects my faction even more.<br />
<br />
Just found out today that Lady Shae in WFP LOVES me.  Har har I swear to the Tribunal that she hunted me down at the gates she hates me that much.  Good old Felguard faction. )<br />

Though that would be barbarian faction. Hmm.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you lost faction either, unless you dueled a human and killed him.<br />
<br />
I've never been able to repair my barbarian faction after that first CoB where we fought to the death, but as a rogue, I don't care.  <br />
<br />
Hmm, I went to Allakhazam's and looked up quests by faction. Here's what I found regarding Freeport Militia: eqdb.allakhazam.com/qsear...faction=31<br />
<br />
Here's what I found regarding Coalition of Tradesfolks Illegal: eqdb.allakhazam.com/qsear...faction=30</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, no deaths at the CoB that I can remember, and no human duels.  I have no idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jaeg</div><div class="date">12-15-00, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a faction bug on Vallon.  I dropped to dubious with corrupt and non-corrupt qeynos guards after being kindly for a looong while.  I'm still apprehensive with the fp militia though, just as I started.  Something to do with having very high faction I bet since I did not do the reserve militia quest to raise fp guard faction like the rest of you Shanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Elegance</div><div class="date">04-27-01, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok lads faction goddess here... yes the lightstones will work but the outer guards are mean basterds so it will take ALOT of gls's and ls's to get good with them. the best way to do this is the red wine quest but grab a bunch o light stones any how or bring a friend who can invis others.<br />
<br />
if you dont have anyone who can invis others get a friend to make a de enchanter.<br />
<br />
load up on gls and ls's and go to sro and turn them in til you hit 4th.<br />
<br />
run like a scared little 4th lvl chanter in sro should.<br />
stop at the zone mem gate and cast it.<br />
<br />
invis the person who wants neriak faction and run like mad for third gate. (hint you shouyld learn the way intimately neriak is confusing as hell at first)<br />
<br />
once in the library have the chanter go out and get you 40 pp worth of red wine (thats alot)<br />
<br />
get the wine from the chanter and give loktar to`biath (close hes in the only room with a door in the library)<br />
<br />
put 4 stacks of 4 red wine in his trade window (DO NOT PRESS TRADE!)<br />
<br />
tell the chanter yer ready and have them invis you while the window is open<br />
<br />
once invis press trade<br />
<br />
do this the first 3 or so times you turn in wine then break your invis (however you want to) and con him<br />
<br />
once hes indiff or better just turn in all the wine you have then find a guard and con him<br />
<br />
be warned it could take another 40 pp worth of wine to get amiable with the guards<br />
<br />
the necs, rouges, clerics, casters, and warriors are all on their own faction but mostly dont roam around much<br />
<br />
psan punox(sp) walks from the clerics guild to third gate propper and appears to be on his own faction...he hates EVERYONE (amusingly enough my barb has better faction with him than my de's do)<br />

<br />
Faction hits will be removed from all the servers except on the team servers were you will lose faction if you kill someone in their home city. - paraphrased from Lady Daegarmo<br />
<br />
Do I know when this will happen?  Unfortuately, no.  I'm not sure if they will be &quot;re-setting&quot; all factions either as it was lost in the noise of the crowd.               Fricka       of the Vallon Zek Shanks<br />
