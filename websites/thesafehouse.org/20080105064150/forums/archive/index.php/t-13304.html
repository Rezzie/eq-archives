<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xelbaaz</div><div class="date">08-30-04, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Patje over at DriverHeaven.net has released DHMODTOOL 2.0 for ATI Catalyst drivers. It allows you to add mobility support to any set of Catalyst drivers.  This is a great tool for laptop owners of Mobility vid cards, as you can use the latest Catalyst drivers for your Radeon mobillity cards.<br />
<br />
Release notes:<br />
<br />
Hi, This is a mass mail to all Modtool users who ever mailed me about a problem or just a friendly thanks.<br />
<br />
The 2 year anniversary of DH called for something special.<br />
<br />
- Changed the setup files, now the Catalyst files installs the way it was meant to be, including the control panel.<br />
- Added support for the Mobility Radeon 9700.<br />
- You now have the option to mod the files only for your card, which speeds up the modding.<br />
- And with the new layout (Credit goes to Craig5320!) people who where experiencing *.ocx errors, those are gone as well.<br />
- Possible resolution fixes for some cards. (Did not have the chance to test on all cards, send me some laptops and I will )<br />
