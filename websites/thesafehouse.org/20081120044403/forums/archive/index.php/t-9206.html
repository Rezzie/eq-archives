<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that we are intended to only backstab with a dagger. Last push (beta phase 1) you could backstab with a sword if you had a dagger in your main hand (since with duel wield it meant you could backstab with a sword because duel wield was a random chance of hitting with your offhand). I'm not sure if it has been fixed this push yet but since duel wield has changed with each hand being independent of each other perhaps it has also affected this as well.<br />
<br />
Other beta rogues please chime in (I've been out of this push for a few weeks with E3 going on etc).</div></div><hr />

I'm still learning controls. To those playing for awhile, animals do not carry loot? Just curious as I'm stumbling around learning things. I right click a corpse and nuttin'.</div></div><hr />

If you kill wolves, you'll often get fangs and/or pelts, or pieces of meat.  When you upgrade to boars, they will drop tusks.  I found a pair of Chain pants off a level 6 boar the other day, too.<br />
<br />
I saw a cool thing too.  A snow leapord found a bunny and pounced on it and killed it.  Left the caracs though.  Woudla been cool if it ate it.</div></div><hr />

I found a really nice staff on a boar the other day as well.  They drop stuff, Rabbit's feet, fangs, meat, fur. <br />

For backstabbing, right now, I'm only using two daggers so I'm guessing it's dagger only.  I don't have the Skill Points to try Swords.  Oh, when you guys are on, join the rogue channel.  Type /join Rogue in the text box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arafain</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last push (beta phase 1) you could backstab with a sword if you had a dagger in your main hand (since with duel wield it meant you could backstab with a sword because duel wield was a random chance of hitting with your offhand). This is incorrect.  Last push, you could backstab with a sword every time if you had a sword in your main hand and a dagger in your offhand, as backstab only checked to see if you had a dagger equipped at all, not whether it was in your main hand, whereas the backstab damage calculation used the damage of whatever was in your main hand for its actual damage.  This could cause some rather interesting effects, since as long as you had a dagger in your offhand, you could backstab with anything, including items that weren't weapons.  In testing this, I backstabbed things with:<br />
<br />
my fists<br />
a torch<br />
a held item<br />
a zero-damage flaming mace used for the Morbent Fel Quest<br />
<br />
Things got particularly interesting with the mace of holy flame, since it technically counted as a melee weapon, too.  Which meant you could sinister strike with it.<br />
<br />
This current push, the code governing fighting move restrictions is very buggy.  For example, if you have a sword in your mainhand, and a dagger in your offhand, you can use sinister strike, and other melee-weapon-required special attacks.  However, you cannot backstab.  So, swap the weapons, right? Sword in offhand, dagger in main, classic EQ rogue setup.  Seems perfectly reasonable.<br />
<br />
However, this is where things get interesting - with the above setup, you can execute backstab and ambush normally - but you cannot execute sinister strike, eviscerate, or any other melee-weapon-required special attack.  This is particularly strange since two-dagger rogues can use these moves without problem, but the effect of equipping a sword in the offhand does strange things to the special attack restrictions code.<br />

In other news, Fricka, how did the idea for a Sneak Attack effect go over at E3?</div></div><hr />

I'm STILL not 100% recovered from my fevers I couldn't even navigate very well when I popped into the game last night. Hehe.<br />
<br />
I didn't get a chance to pitch it Arafain, it was quite hectic since I didn't get an official appointment. I did get to say some things to a producer and I got a business card so next chance I'll get I'll work it in.<br />

Nocte, LLabak, etc: Rabbits, deer, frogs, cows these all used to be labeled as &quot;Ambient&quot; and were all only level 1.  I did notice that you can gain skill increases off of them (for throwing skill for instance) and also... you can skin them if you are skinner, hehe. I've usually gotten ruined leather scraps but I once got a light leather from a rabbit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That explains it then. Thanks Fricka. I figured if it were empty it would at least give me an empty loot window or something. I did get skill ups as well... and the bunny fought back. I'll spend some real time with it this weekend hopefully.</div></div><hr />

I love slaughtering the Sheep in Loch Modan. hehehe and then shearing them for my tailoring exploits.</div></div><hr />
