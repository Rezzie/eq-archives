Im a lvl 12 Varanjar Rogue with maxed hide/sneak but still when I tried to sneak up on ppl they saw me way before I got to them to do the Ravage. I understand that you shouldnt be able to sneak up on ppl 2 or even 1 lvl above you but I tried on several 12s and 11s and even one 10. They all saw me. Is this the way it is or did I manage to do something wrong? :)<br />
<br />
The stealth is the only thing we got going for us... If that doesnt work then what should we do?</div></div><hr />

So, while you rely on stealth as a part of your combat, it is useless for pvp.<br />
You move slower invis'ed than everyone else, so your chances of getting to them before they see you is far too low.<br />
Buy a horse, and just try charging in uninvis'ed.<br />
Sad to say, but you will probably have better luck :roll <br />

<br />
I dont know why we dont get a skill, like how the tank can teleport behind a target. Call it Swift Strike or something, target about 20 away, activate it shoots us out of stealth, as we teleport/sprint like hell and strike the enemy for a backstab/ravage dmg. if It uses all the endurace it would be a good trade off.<br />
<br />
Rogues are meant to be about hard fast deadly strikes. Then we are weak for the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shauwn</div><div class="date">02-09-07, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea,give us an ability equivalent to what WoW Warriors got, &quot;Hamstring&quot; where u can cast while stealthed and up to 20 feet away or so..But make it usable ONLY from behind and while stealthed.. Instead of calling it hamstring,call it something like &quot;Windstrike&quot; where you strike like the wind or something???  Heres a good description of the attack..<br />
<br />
The Rogue strikes like the wind dealing 300% weapon damage and snares your opponent for 5 seconds..You must be stealthed and flanking your opponent when you use this attack.. Level required to lern this attack is 14..Costs 35-40 endurance to use..<br />
<br />
Now that would be a great stealth starting attack.Much better than the retarded ravage..Ravage IS NOT A PVP ATTACK..It's only good fo PvE and it's just shiiiiiiiitttttttttyyyyyyyyyyy.U have to mope your way over to the mob like pop pop and HOPE he doesn't detect you..And HOPE he doesn't move..If he moves u have to mope for an even longer time..Then when performing the attack,u have a great chance to miss... I hate the way ravage is right now..<br />
<br />
Rogues are horrible and without an attack like I suggested,the class is just not fun..I'm level 17 and I'm officially done with my rogue..I'm gonna have to play my level 8 ranger now since they are 409534045 times useful,better,and more fun than rogues are..<br />
<br />
Anyway,an ability like windstrike would be every rogues dream defining ability..A ranged melee attack that does good damage,snares your opponent and will allow you to set up whatever combo you like such as blinding flash,backstab,then when whoever your fighting tries to either root us,slow us,whatever,we can eventually hit smokebomb which allows us to stealth to perform windstrike again when ppl try to run away.. This would be a very useful and prized attack for rogues..<br />
<br />
Anyone agree or disagree? <br />
<br />
We definitely need a few more different types of ability liens though,for sure..I'm quitting my rogue until a FULLL REVAMP is done..At least when the class is fixed,I wont be to far behind at level 17 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alodar</div><div class="date">02-09-07, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First question I have in this is:<br />
<br />
are your sneak/hide skills maxxed?  I've found that when they are, practically no one below my level sees me, and those that do often miss my sneaking outline.<br />
<br />
Secondly,<br />
<br />
At the higher levels, most people do'nt have detection maxxed out.  It's just not something that happens unless you try for it, or are around a lot of stealthed mobs a lot.  Sooo.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure pvp stealth has nothing to do with stealth &amp; detection skills and a quick bandaid has been set that is, if a PC is higher or equal to your lv, he will see you easily, if below, he wont.  From my experience, as of the latest patch, skill is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shauwn</div><div class="date">02-19-07, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly right! which is dumb,which is one reason I had to reroll once my rogue hit level 17..I now have a level 18 shammy,and he is 10x more better than what rogues are right now..I can solo level 19 3 dot mobs and easily take out 2 level 18 two dot mobs at once and 3 even con 2 dot mobs at the same time..<br />
<br />
My rogue had a very hard time taking out two 2 dot mobs at once,and 60% of the time he had to runnnn away,*sighs*<br />
<br />
So right now I think Shammies are the most complete fun class in VG..Glad I rerolled..I don't think I'll ever go back to playiung my rogue unless major improvements are done..</div></div><hr />
