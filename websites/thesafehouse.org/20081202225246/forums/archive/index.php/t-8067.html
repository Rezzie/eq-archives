I spent over 1k today (including selling the sloth back to the vendor) raising my skill. Went from 222 to 231.. 9 points. It is just slow</div></div><hr />

Selling back the sloth is highly advised.  At 230 I started to make money back as long as my cha was 115.   Looks like your highest stat on the list is dex so I would try to get a shammy dex buff before you grind points out, the other stats don't make a difference since skill checks go off the highest of those 3 stats.  Good luck and keep at it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sinuiid</div><div class="date">10-24-02, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a real pain at the 200 or so level, so many combines and not very many skill points raised.<br />
<br />
I would recommend if you have any skill practices left, to use maybe 15 or 20 of them to kick you up to around 230 where your successes wil be greater and overall price of raising skill will be cheaper. 20 practices from 205-230 should run around 1.5-2k but will be probly 1k cheaper then doing the combines or around there.<br />
<br />
I spent 750pp after selling back the sos poisons and only got 3 points out of it, then went to trainer, each practice was only 88pp or so, and then went up accordingly of course.<br />
<br />
But much more economical if u have the practices to spare. Sheistyelf- Dark Elf Assassin <br />

I think that it is all in how lucky you get when working it. I stood right in front of the poison merchant in FV and combined away.<br />

But i also have good faction and 2 opal encrusted steins, so i sell back SoS for 14pp 2gp... now its easy again... skill is at 220 so far.  All i did was bind in FV, go to nexus get focus, C3 and VoG... All spells that last quite a while. then port back to FV, and make poisons till you wrist gets blue and swollen! ;p</div></div><hr />
