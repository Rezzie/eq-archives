<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mankarr</div><div class="date">04-26-00, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, this isn't for those who don't want to know about the Scouts of Tunare quests.  I'm only level 16 really close to 17 so I don't have that much experience but I thought I would post this one because it struck me as something to write about just a day ago.  Not very good, but here goes:<br />
<br />
After a month of ferrying information from Crushbone back to his guild, the young scout was wondering when he would get his next assignment.  Quite proud that he could wield two weapons at once, albeit not all that well, Mankarr felt that he should receive his next mission.<br />
<br />
He approached Geeda and handed her the note from an undercover agent named Kelynn.  She praised him as usual on his work and went about her business.  However, earlier when he contacted Kelynn, to get the latest information on Crushbone movements, he said to see Laren about earning the Scout Blade.  Excited that he might finally get another mission to perform for the guild, he hurried to Laren.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail,&quot; Mankarr says as he greets Laren.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome, Mankarr.  What is it you seek from Laren and the Scouts of Tunare?&quot; he responds.<br />
<br />
Mankarr proceeds to ask him about the Scout Blade and how to earn it.  Laren replies with a story about how the Scout Blades were made by a master craftsman that is no more due to an unexpected death by the hand of an enemy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will avenge the craftsman,&quot; Mankarr promises.<br />
<br />
Laren hands him an unusual token with a pathway leading up to a castle, while leaving him instructions to where this castle, Highkeep it was called, stood and who to contact while he was there.<br />
<br />
&quot;The merchants there should know about his whereabouts.  Good luck, Mankarr,&quot; Laren says.<br />
<br />
Anxious to start on his journey he hurries to Butcherblock Mountains.  He had made the journey to Kaladim many times but has yet to catch a boat at the docks.  Running for hours, he finally finds the dock enclosed by walls.  He walks up to one other person who seems to be fishing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail,&quot; Mankarr says, &quot;This is where the boat comes in I believe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said the dwarf and continued to fish.<br />
<br />
Now thinking that it would be a while until the boat finally came, he decided to practice his swimming.  While he came up for air for the fifth time, he heard someone shout, &quot;BOAT!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my ride,&quot; he thought as he climbed out of the water.<br />
<br />
Finally on the boat, Mankarr explores the length as it leaves the dock behind.  He discovered that the boat itself was not very interesting, but it offered practice for his Safe Fall.  Climbing to the back of the boat, he jumped from one level to the next.  After a while, sensing that he would not be able to be better at it until he sees more of the world, Mankarr goes to the railing and looks out to sea.  Soon, he began to notice that he was weakening and losing stamina.  His first time on the boat was not very pleasant as he was soon encumbered.  Thinking, he found a way to counteract this weakness by running occasionaly.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what they must call being seasick,&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
After the long boat ride, a port came into view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Freeport, a human city.  I should be bound here with my soul even though I prefer Kelethin,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Running away from Freeport after being bound, heading west as his sense direction told him, Mankarr took notice of his surroundings.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are called the Commonlands?  Not so common I think.  Where are all the trees?&quot; as he ran right by a zombie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaagghh,&quot; the zombie said as he proceeded to attack the wood elf.<br />
<br />
Turning around, the young scout quickly sized up his opponent.  Reasonably safe, he engaged in battle.  Slightly intimidated by the sounds his enemy made, he nonetheless dispatched the foe.  Looking around for other enemies he spotted another zombie.  He quickly looted the fallen corpse and continued his travel.  <br />
<br />
&quot;A zombie's bead must be a lumpy one, or they wouldn't be leaving it so often,&quot; Mankarr thought, grinning to himself.<br />
<br />
Soon, he came upon a forest nearing midnight, as close as he could tell.  Not liking the looks of the forest, he used his abilities to hide and sneak.  He came upon a cabin a short ways from the entrance.  Opening the door silently he saw a merchant.  Wondering what he was selling, the young scout made himself visible so as to inquire about his wares.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a dread wolf struck!  Breaking through the wall of the house (don't you HATE it when enemies go through walls?  Sorry to interrupt the story a bit here, but it annoys me to no end when I am &quot;safe&quot; inside a stone building and an enemy comes through to attack me) it slashed at the unsuspecting rogue dealing tremendous damage.  Stunned, the rogue attempted to run only to be cut down from behind with a few swipes.<br />
<br />
Materializing, naked of course, at the gate to Freeport, the young scout started to curse at himself for not being more careful.  Sighing, he started his trek back to the dangerous woods, Kithicor.  This time being more careful, he followed the path, hidden from all of his enemies.  He sweated from no small amount of fear as he saw clearly superior undead enemies surrounding him, while he journied through their territory.  From long effort, he finally found a pass to Serpent's Spine.  Relieved, he started his way up.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he heard clashing and the familiar sounds of orcs fighting.  Paranoid, as he was coming from Kithicor, he dived into a safe spot and snuck up to the battle.  To his amazement there were three orc warriors bigger than him going his way!  No, wait.  They were running from something.  Suddenly there was a flash of light and Mankarr saw the orcs go down in flames.  Sweating from relief, he remained hidden and went to the source of the spell.  Amazed by how many people there were, (lots of lag from it :P) he assumed it was safe enough to run through the pass.<br />
<br />
Running through the twisting passages, he came upon a camp of bandits unawares.  Suddenly all three of them yelled and pounced on him.  Seeing death flash before his eyes, the rogue went fleeing back to the guards.  Lucky him that the guards killed them before he himself was killed.  Bleeding badly from several wounds, and a couple of backstabs one landed, he sat down to rest.  After he was in halfway decent shape he determined to be more careful when looking around corners.  Finally, he reached Highkeep.<br />
<br />
First he explored the castle and found many secret passages.  While exploring the depths, or more precisely, the beginning of the depths, he wisely chose to withdraw because of many high seasoned veterans fighting pickclaws, the ugly brutes they are.  He came across some prisons where he saw a beautiful lady.  However, he chose to stay away from her for he sensed that she practiced dark, forbidden magic.  While occupied with his surrounding he did not notice that the prisoners scowled at him.  Passing a little too close to one, Mankarr was suddenly attacked by him.  How he escaped his prison, he did not know.  However he knew that he had to fight this unkempt person, however reluctant he felt.<br />
<br />
The prisoner seemed to be a good fighter, however he was no match for fast blades.  Battered a bit by the fight, Mankarr went back a bit and sat down to rest.  There were more prisoners that came his way when he was done resting.  Unfortunately, someone came by with a pack of prisoners on his tail.  Wanting to help him out, the young rogue landed many backstabs and flying blades took them out.  The fight was tough, with Mankarr surviving bitterly injured.  Mankarr felt that he had gained enough experience of the world to do better, and when he next considered the prisoners, most were easy to take care of.<br />
<br />
The young scout, now done exploring the keep, was anxious to find this person, Kenn Faedrick.  Inquiring many merchants to this person netted no information, until he came across a jail clerk.  Easy into the topic easy, he casually asked if she had seen someone named Fenn Kaedrick.  The response was vehement.  She obviously did not like this rogue and wondered why in the world someone bailed him out.  She said that he was in a cell with another person.  Thanking her for the conversation he proceeded to follow this new lead.<br />
<br />
Sneaking through the prisoners' cells he headed to another cell with two people guarding, it seemed, two prisoners.  Walking up to the high elf, Mankarr asked him if he had seen Fenn Kaedrick.  He responded in whispers that he had and told me to look up on top of the keep where he himself would meet him when he could escape.  Thanking him, the scout set off to climb to the top.<br />
<br />
Mankarr headed to the top floor and was slightly stymied when he remembered that there were balconies.  He snuck out to the left balcony and climbed to the roof.  There he was!  Fenn Kaedrick the person he was looking for.  He approached him and engaged in light conversation and handed him the token.  Fenn was delighted and told Mankarr that he was here to assassinate Xentil Herkanon, the person responsible for the death of the craftsman.  Mankarr asked where he was and Fenn said that he was somewhere in the keep with two bodyguards he should avoid, and wished him luck as he left.<br />
<br />
Now, with the mission at hand, Mankarr went sneaking through the keep back downstairs to the first floor.  He thought that if he saw any of Xentil's bodyguards he would search the rooms they were near.  If not, he would methodically peek into each of the rooms.<br />
<br />
There! Was it?  Yes, it was.  One of the bodyguards Fenn talked about.  He turned the corner, but not before Mankarr sized him up.  Yes, the young rogue would avoid him at all cost for the scout would die if he attempted to kill one of them.  Shivering with relief, and anticipation, he searched the rooms near the bodyguard.  No luck.  He then broadened his search to nearby hallways.  He opened another door and saw Xentil Herkanon by his bed.  He silently closed the door behind him.  Surprised, his would be victim turned around and demanded what he was doing there.  Offering false apologies that he was in the wrong room and he would leave immediately, Mankarr readied a dagger behind his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;See that it does not happen again!&quot; fumed Xentil as he turned his back, clearly dismissing his intruder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I shall assure you it will not,&quot; Mankarr replied, as he took his dagger and stabbed him in the back.<br />
<br />
Blood gurgling in his throat, Xentil had only enough breath to turn around in surprise and utter words of future retribution by his bodyguards and uncle.  (Man I wish that happened, after all how many people do you see get stabbed in the back and then turn around and start duking it out with their assailant? Hmm?)<br />
<br />
After the blood stopped flowing out of the victim's gaping wound, Mankarr swiftly cut off Xentil's head in a cold-blooded, calculated move; keeping proof of Xentil's death.  He dispassionately wiped his blade clean of the wretch's blood on his lifeless form.<br />
<br />
Turning away and stowing the head in his traveling sack, he skillfully managed to elude the bodyguards looking for him.  Once passed Highkeep he started his trek back to Kelethin.<br />
<br />
Sorry it was so long, of course a lot of the things didn't happen in the game (I especially hated actually fighting Xentil instead of killing him in one blow).  I hoped you liked it!  I might write about other things I did, but I'd like to see how you like this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sneaking Uponya I think that maybe I will be a little surer of being a little nearer thats all. Eternity is in the understanding that a little is more than enough. ~~ I stand ready to die for the world, who will stand with me?</div></div><hr />
