<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-24-03, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sunday night I ran Castles Forlorn after a 3 or 4 week break. Previously, the PCs had trounced over 40 goblyns in this narrow hallway, and I had to (weakly) diffuse the situation or destroy the party utterly. Since then my PCs have strutted with confidence, begged to go back to the present time period so they could pick another huge fight. Instead, I ran them and entire session with one 3 round combat.<br />
<br />
The whole crux of the adventure is finding out who the lord of the castle is. While my PCs think that each ruler of the castle they meet in the past is strange, they haven't figured it out yet. They have played with the idea surely, but after this session, they aren't sure what to think.<br />
<br />
They inadvertantly stumbled upon the lord's sanctuary where he lays unconcious for 4 days a year. They find it, use some mathmatical spells to gleen some patchy and weird information. All the while, conspiracy theories and whacked out premises from a 12 year old ghost lord to werewolves spring up in their heads. Then, later, they meet the lord's necromancer, skulking around at night. She catches them picking the lock to her personal laboratory, which I gave vague descriptions of to the thief who was at the door. <br />
<br />
Then, I let a rumor drop about a vampire living in the castle. The PCs scoffed, said it was a bluff of sorts, so I introduced them to a serving girl who is the vampires latest victim. The PCs started at me dumbfounded, completely at a loss for what to think. I've left them so many dangling cords and tantalizing hints, from ghosts saying come to the basement, to a warning to stay out of the lord's library, the sacred oak tree in the courtyard that they know is tied to the troubles in the land....they are boggled. Getting to watch people's heads spin from your ideas is almost more fun than being a PC &quot;It's like every chatroom cliche crawled into Safehouse to die&quot; -Caowyth<br />

<br />
Events lead up to us trapped in a room.  We walked through the front door of an abandoned mansion we were told we had to go into or our NPC friend would be executed. The situation didnt give us any choice but the front door because of the 50 bad guys outside holding the NPC hostage.  (Plus a hint from the GM that the 'Plot Wagon Tracks' lead through the door)<br />
We look for clues as to how to get out and the GM tells us that we find no cracks, symbols, engravings or anything else on the walls that would denote some sort of cluse.<br />
We all pour over our equipment and spells trying to come up with something that would help dig, but nothing affects the walls at all (Even the magical warhammer of disruption)<br />
PassWall did no good.  Teleport was ineffective.<br />
So we think maybe theres a password or something.  We start reciting things we picked up from past adventures. (Was basiclly the start of this one)  Our bard got a good roll on his Bardic Knowlage for anything he knew about the mansion but came up with nothing.  None of our &quot;Passwords&quot; worked.<br />
<br />
Result.  We told him we were going to sit in the room for awhile and see if someone (golem or something maybe, the mansion was abandoned) would come to &quot;Collect the Prisioners&quot;  He spirts out &quot;Ok 2 Days have gone by and nobody has shown up.  I cant beleive you guys cant figure this out, its so simple.&quot;<br />
<br />
Being frustrated we try things again, not matter how insane they seem.  We even sang some songs thinking it was part of it.  Completely Covered the White Marble Walls with Charcoal so that it was entirelly black.  Knocked on the Walls. Yelled to let us out.  One of us even Held another person upside down so they could Stand on the ceiling.  Nothing was working.<br />
Finally after about 2 hours just trying to get out of this dang room we said &quot;We give up, Nothing works&quot;<br />
GM gave us a look like we were all idiots  Told us that if we were going to stop trying to get out then we would all die there.  At that point we really didnt care, had only played the characters for 2 adventures anyway and were only 4th level (Started 3rd).  His response &quot;Ok, roll up new characters then.&quot;  He wouldent tell us how we were supposed to get out of the friggin room either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">06-26-03, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ill admit though,  DMing can be a real  . (Sorry, had to use it)<br />
<br />
I like running Fantasy games because you can really stretch the story.  Because of the way magic works, or should I say the lack of limits on how it works, you can do just about anything you want for a storyline.  My problem is that I cant seem to run a good Fantasy Game.  Put me in Shadowrun GM position and people rave about it, but I try Fantasy and I end up railroading the players to much. <br />
Ive discovered I put to much story into the settings and end up telling people the story more than letting them play the game.  The players end up feeling like characters in a book they are reading as opposed to their own characters.<br />
Of course none of them have said that outright, but I sit there  GMing and realized that that is my perception.  And If that is my perception then its probably more obvious to the players.  Thats probably why all my Fantasy games fall apart, because I try to compensate and end up trashing the campaign.<br />
<br />
I do like playing in Fantasy games however, and I like to GM them because I have so many plots and ideas to play through.  Every time I think about starting another campaign however I think about what I do to them and I dont want to do that to the players. <br />
People always ask me to run Shadowrun however because of the twisted plots and back-plots, and story-hooks I come up with.<br />
<br />
WHY CANT I DO THE SAME THING IN A FANTASY GAME?!:&quot;&gt;  Ticks me off to no end.</div></div><hr />

There goes your hint about the room having an exit.<br />
After 2 days in a room you will definitely run out of air to breath.<br />
And if you just have a cleric for create food/water, then you can't die....well, you can still die of old age, but I usually play elves, so that's not really an issue.<br />
<br />
I remember a game where our DM got us into a very similar situation.<br />
We knew it was some kind of demiplane, but of course had no spells to get out immediately, so we had to look for an exit.<br />
Immagine a d12. That's what the demiplane was like, 12 &quot;rooms&quot; with no apparent exit, but a way to make 5 portals appear.<br />
Most portals were random, or worked in a way we never figured out.<br />
So we were running through these 12 rooms, looking for an exit, each room (unless we had already visided it) posed the same problem, how can we get out of here ?<br />
<br />
The real problem was that every time we went through a portal there was a random chance to be drained 1 lvl  <br />
<br />
Talk about mean DMs<br />
<br />
However, our DM no longer tries to put us into no-win situations, that may be 'cause last time he did we had a week to figure out how to get out.<br />
And I gave him about 4 pages of possible solutions.<br />
Took him forever to read through it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
k, right there is a sign that you aren't making decisions, the DM is making them for you. I've been accused(mildly) of trying to do that, like when the PCs first found the Lord's sleeping chamber, they left, to got get another PC that was resting. No one told me they put the tomb back in place, no one told me they shut the door. It was noon. So they come back, and find guards out front, and the living Lord of the castle walking away. <br />
<br />
PCs were pissed. &quot;It's just a given that we would put it back&quot;. If it had been that important to me, I as a PC would have told the DM. Being midday, someone(probably the lord) noticed that the door to the tomb was open(there are about 1000 windows looking into the court yard). Now, if I saw the door, and the SECRET door to my sanctuary standing wide open, I'd put some @#%$ guards there. And if I as a servant or guards stumbled on it, I'd let my lord or master know. <br />
<br />
I've been uh...adjusting some of the divination and information gathering spells. Some of that stuff is designed to tell you like, everything about a single person, information which would make this adventure over in 20 minutes if it could be gotten that easily. Players have been griping about that too, but they accept it, especially when it works, and I give them some really ambigious, creepy vision that makes no sense to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">06-26-03, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't do that in a fantasy game because fantasy isnt shadowrun?<br />
<br />
Shadowrun = the genre of being led around by the nose by forces unseen for reasons unknown.  (I've also heard it called the genre of betrayal, but thats another thread)<br />
<br />
Fantasy games tend more towards the players wanting to be at least semi-important and independent, rather than complete pawns.  Duping them is OK occasionally, but not continuously.<br />
<br />
Just my take on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">06-30-03, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yaknow, I think Swipey figured it out for me. <br />
Quote:genre of betrayal<br />
I tend to put a lot of backstabbing in my twisted and &quot;NPC's with their own agenda's&quot; plots into my campaigns.<br />
Fantasy games arn't set up as well for that.   And come to think of it the only Fantasy campaigns I had that went half-way decient was the ones that had demons pulling the strings in the background and such.<br />
<br />
Intresting....  Thanks Swipey!    <br />

<br />
Then what ideas would you have come up with?<br />
As far as the room running out of air we figured that there was some sort of magic at work anyway.  If passwall was inneffective and teleport got us nowhere there was obviously some magic at work.<br />
Maybe he threw us into a Demi-plane or something and those were the walls of the plane.  Would explain why the teleport wouldent work as well because the space we were in would be the only space available to teleport to.<br />
We had no way of telling if we were still on prime, we were only 4th level.  The wizard had a magic item that gave him traviling magic.  (Expedious Retreat, Passwall, Dimension Door, Teleport: I think that was all of them  1/week Each)  The cleric had a warhammer of disruption.  The others just had some defensive magic items.<br />
<br />
Now true, we could have gone against the DM's decision for us to go in.  We could have let them kill the hostage and went down in a blaze of glory fighting 50 thugs.  We figured if we went through the doors we would stand a chance to rescue the hostage later and if we had to pick off the thugs in smaller numbers when we had the advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-30-03, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the responsiblity of a good GM to keep the game going. If my PCs just don't @#%$ get it, I will drop them a bone, albeit a very small one. I picture your GM sitting behind the screen, arms crossed, frown in place going &quot;I can't believe you guys don't get this&quot;. Comments and attitudes like that are for after game, which is when I let my PCs know if they met, exceeded, or missed my expectations. <br />
<br />
Good DMing is like playing Poker. Everything you as the DM say and do, from tone to body language, is interpreted by your players as people, and meta-gamed into PC behavior. Telling your PCs, &quot;Omg, you DON'T get my plot line?!?!&quot; doesn't give them the feel they are in a world, as living breating things, it makes them feel like they are in a video game, and can't figure out how to push the blocks around to open the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">06-30-03, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think I'd be very good at running Shadowrun.<br />
<br />
NPCs having their own agenda is good, but I tend to do better in a fantasy setting where they tend to be much more open about things.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, Powers in a fantasy game tend to gain their power through holdings of lands, loyalties, hardware, and prestige.<br />
<br />
Much of what they do is done within the confines of a code of honor, and underhanded dealings (defined as dealings that violate the code) tend to hurt as much or more than they help.  Sure, you can lie, cheat and steal to gain hardware or even lands.  But if (and when) it becomes known that you do such things, you lose prestige and the loyalty and/or trust of your subordinates.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also see most powers in the world as being inherently conservative.  They may want to expand their own power, but they want to retain what they have even more.  Risks are to be avoided, if at all possible.  Safe, incremental expansion via a plethora of small actions and plots is much preferred to explosive, go-for-broke takeovers.  Such takeovers tend to make other powers uneasy, and bring alliances about among them to deal with the upstart (you) who is upsetting the status quo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but what kind of magic ?<br />
Detect Magic can give you an idea of the school of magic involved.<br />
Even if Dispelling it is not an option, you can still figure out if there is a one way gate to the plane of air (conj/summ magic) or some sort of permanent renewal (alteration magic)<br />
<br />
There are non-magical ways to negate both PassWall and Teleport, so those are not really a problem.<br />
<br />
Detect Invisibility didn't show anything ? <br />
<br />
Hoe about &quot;reduce&quot; on the brick ? It makes nice holes.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Demiplanes are created by 9th level spells, I know of some DMs that like ot put low lvl players against lvl 18+ enemies (or effects) but that's rather pointless.<br />
Besides, demiplanes need 2 way portals otherwise they're useless.<br />
Unless you want to use them as prisons, that is.<br />
<br />
I like these seeming hopeless situations.... when they don't happen to my characters, that is  <br />
<br />
Did your DM tell how you were supposed to get out when you rolled new toons ?<br />
<br />
I would have rolled a priest, friend/relative of the dead character, that had a vision during a dream, showing the death of your first toon.<br />

<br />
While Detect magic says a strong aura can conceal a less powerful one, yoou can still try to determine the school of magic of each aura you see.<br />
<br />
We have a lot of fun pretendin to put on sunglasses when we cast detect magic on obviously powerful items or possible artifacts.<br />
But the light comes from my lvl 0 (or 1) spell, and it ain't gonna blind me.<br />
<br />
An d it just takes a spellcraft check to determine the school of magic of each aura under D&amp;amp;D 3rd, and my DM is not going to prevent me from using my skill on at least the most powerful aura(s)<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />

<br />
<br />
most likely he didn't even have dispel, not something a lvl 4 mage is likely to have, so not something your DM should require to get out of a room.<br />
And if you cannot dispel it, not even with a 20, you can just tell you DM, thank you for placing a mage 10 levels above us against us.<br />

Quote:<br />

<br />
You can still dig through them if you have enough passwalls, and the last long enough.<br />
I was thinking of iron reiforced walls, which should be quite common when  your enemies can teleport through all of your walls and guards.<br />

<br />
Teleport is (in D&amp;amp;D 3rd) instant transport through the astral plane (so much for being unable to travel through planes)<br />
There are nn magical ways (or at least ways that don't include spells) that stop astral travel.<br />
A demiplane in the deep ethereal, where all Demiplanes usually are btw, has no connection to the astral plane, as such you cannot teleport at all.<br />
The psionic power Divert teleport can change the destination of a teleport (but it allows a will save)<br />
<br />
But I have no idea what could make a teleport fail and deal some damage, whatever the means they're definitely far above what a low level party can do.<br />

Waste of time if you ask me, anyone that can create such a trap will 100% be under the effect of detect hidden, true sight, or wear an item that allows it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">07-01-03, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't feel like starting another thread so I'll ask here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How do you deal with overly prepared PCs? When I had these guys make 4th lvl characters, I gave them magic items. The monk, who uses hand damage, traded off with another PC for his Gauntlets of Ogre Power. He asked, does this count as a magic attack? Sure, I said. No big problems so far. So then, he goes on to get someone's ring of shocking grasp. &quot;A punch is the same as a grasp right? I should be able to discharge this as I punch right?&quot; I couldn't find a reason to tell him no without pulling DMs perogitive. End result: A monk who, 3 times a day, can inflict 25 points of damage with hand attacks.<br />
<br />
This wasn't an issue til tonight really. I hadn't had any really bad ass monsters to throw at them til now. So I throw the googly of googly ghosts at them, that ages 1d4x20 years in a gaze attack. I think they should be getting pretty scared. What does this monk do? He goes etheral, and starts dealing out massive damage to this ghost, and combined with other party attacks, takes it from 80 hp to 20 in about 2 rounds. One player is now an 80 year old Ranger, heh. Anyways, the ghost has an MR of 40%, and needs +3 weapons or greater to wound. Now, I know the monk doesn't qualify for that, and he hurt it because that bonus drops to +1 in the ethereal. So the ghost had to end up possesing an innocent bystander and lashing out violently at other innocents to bide his time, waiting for the monk to come out of ethereal or have the spell duration run out, so he can flee like a scared bitch invisible through the ethereal and regenerate.<br />
<br />
THE END @#%$ BOSS OF THE MOD AND ONE PLAYER SCHOOLED IT. Damn. Granted, I could have just gazed attacked the monk, but that is about it. Can't inflict any real damage to PCs, just possess and aging. It's either a) ruin entire characters one by one or b) let them win. To boot, they are just tearing through everything in existance with ethereal travel. It's kind of obnoixous. If the ghost hadn't gone invisible at will, which he can, the monk would have gone ethereal, which he did, and run him down like a dog. <br />
<br />
How do I fix this situation. This was supposed to be a pretty ground breaking encounter for the PCs. I wasn't intending to wipe the party, just shake them up a little. Sure, they are scared to death of the aging thing, but the monk is just sitting, firm in the knowledge that he can go toe to toe with the ghost and probably win. It galls me that once again, my PCs had me completely backed into a corner, although I'm not sure if they were aware of it. They were trying to excerise the ghost with holy water, healing spells, and I had to make some split second decisions about what would and wouldn't work, which ended up in a couple frustrated PCs. Should I just...make them all old men? That is my only real recourse. I guess I could possess the monk and start kicking the parties ass...but he never seems to blow those saving throws when I really wish he would.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This looks like 2nd ed AD&amp;amp;D.<br />
<br />
Those PC are not overly prepared at all.<br />
They just have too much stuff for their level.<br />
<br />
As a rule I tend to avoid, or delay as much as possible the day when the PCs get access to  movement spells (fly, dimensional door, teleport) and that includes ethereal travel.<br />
What is a 4th lvl character doing with the ability to become ethereal is beyond me.<br />
<br />
Ghosts have nothing else going for them, becoming ethereal, aging and possessing, so, if a character can go ethereal, doesen't care about becomning a bit more wise, and manages to save vs spell, he can avoid the ghost.<br />
Killing the ghost is not really about bringing it's HP to 0 however, fighting a ghost in melee will never make it disappear forever.<br />
What they have to is find out why there is a ghost and so how they can destroy it forever. All that while the ghost shows every once in a while to harass them.<br />
<br />
But if you still want to make them fight vs the ghost, then I suggest a bit of 3rd Ed D&amp;amp;D rules.<br />
Ghost touch weapons and armor are interesing things that let incorporeal creatures hit and damage corporeal ones (and vice versa)<br />
And if you don't want the then to get those tools, they can simply disappear when the ghost is finally destroyed.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Introduce him to the crypt, or some other unholy place where the ghost possession is more powerful, or his saves vs spells are penalized.<br />
Don't worry, it could be worse. I immagine the fun my DM had when I told him that my priest had a save vs spell of 1 and a save vs mind-affecting spells that was about -3 (or more on a d20) and that he could stop trying with that vampire charm</div></div><hr />

I think Ethereal travel in revised 2nd ed. is like a 3rd lvl spell he has access to. It's within reasonable range of spells. We play with the notion that Priests don't memorize, they can pull up spells as they need from their spheres, because it's prayer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">07-02-03, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The monk is making hand attacks that qualify as magical because he is wearing guantlets of ogre power?  Good enough.<br />
<br />
Gauntlets of Ogre power are magical hand coverings, after all.<br />
<br />
However... if the ghost is only hit by +1 weapons or better in ethereal form, the Gauntlets of Ogre Power aint gonna help.<br />
<br />
The to hit and damage bonuses granted by the gauntlets are the way the system simulates the advantage in melee combat accrued by being immensely strong.  Someone wearing Gauntlets of Ogre Power, is, in effect, the same as a person who has a natural 18/00 Strength wearing +0 gloves.  There is no inherent magical attack bonus in the gauntlets, though they do count as magical for creatures hit only by magic (of an unspecified level)<br />
<br />
But... too late for that, as you have already let the character hit the ghost using them.<br />
<br />
<br />
What you're after now is a way to beef up the ghost encounter a tad, then, right?  <br />
<br />
Give it a little bit of cannon fodder.  Some followers it can terrorize into attacking the party to soak off some of their attention.  The followers, of course, will have special instructions to nail the monk first.<br />
<br />
Or... give it an ethereal magic item or two.  You can even make them really nice, since they are always ethereal, and only effect ethereal things.  How often will the players find that useful?  And how, exactly, will they carry about ethereal items if they dont remain ethereal all the time themselves?  (maybe if they had a &quot;+3&quot; bag, which is enough to effect ghostly things, they might be able to put the item in it while they were temporarily ethereal, then lug it about when solid)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">07-02-03, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part One is already done. He has a necromancer woman that is actually part of the module, I've gave her some nasty magic items, and am about to make her spell book. They've already met her and she caught them tailing her and breaking into her necromancy labroratory. Just been waiting for an excuse to use her as an encounter, but that would mean open war in the castle, not sure if I want it to come to that yet. <br />
<br />
In addition, I made him a captain of the guard that is also a werewolf, because some how, they got the idea in their heads because of the strong wolf motif in the castle, there must be werewolves! So I didn't want to disappoint them. But I had to beef up a normal werewolf to make him a challenge for the party, might change him to a greater wolfwere or something later, but that might be a bit..excessive  <br />
<br />
I'm just mad because they had the ghost at 5hps, trapped in the body he possesed, the body was blinded so he couldn't make any sort of attacks, they were throwing holy water on him, casting heal spells on him, with a kungfu monk waiting for him the ethereal when he was ready to flee. I was like @#%$, they are completely running this situation, and it sucked. I need to put them back in Castle C for a while. Tired of not having stuff to throw at them(even though most of the Caste B people hate them) because of the ruse of being normal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: I think he was considering attacks made with gauntlets of ogre strength magical because they're magical gauntlets. It would make sense for a monk to be able to use a magical gauntlet as a weapon, at least in my opinion.<br />
<br />
At what point to monks get innate +1 fists in 2e? It might not matter anymore anyway if the monk has +1 fists naturally, so he could have hit the ghost even without the gauntlets.<br />
<br />
And instead of using a ghost, you could have used a lesser black reaver. Don't have the stats for one? Make them up. Afterall, as a player, the first thing I think when I see a &quot;lesser&quot; creature is, &quot;...great, what is a *greater* going to do?&quot; Sensei Pren,<br />

Normally, he does between 1-3 points of damage, +str, with a chance for knock out.<br />
<br />
I couldn't really think of reason for telling him no about the gauntlets, it seemed fair that the monk be able to have a magic attack of some kind, they knew they were going to need it. The ring of shocking grasp though....I knew that was going over board, but trying to rationalize that to my players didn't really happen. I let them have because I didn't want to make it an issue, and now it's biting mei in the ass. I should have just told him, gauntlets over the ring doesn't work, and you have to grasp, not punch, people to have the effect.</div></div><hr />
