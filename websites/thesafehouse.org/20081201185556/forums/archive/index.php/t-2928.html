<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Grimjaw Badflagon</div><div class="date">04-19-02, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the trap goes as follows:<br />
<br />
An altar has an iron dragon hanging above it, that apparently was used as initiation for some cult.<br />
<br />
On the altar is a riddle~<br />
<br />
The Poor have it<br />
The Rich need it<br />
Eating it will bring death.<br />
<br />
If you read the riddle thats when the magic takes effect.  You try to leave the room , the dragon breathes 8d6 or something on you.<br />
<br />
Now heres the fun part, if you answer incorrectly it also blasts you for 8d6, but if you dont give an answer *or* give the correct answer the altar shoots a green ray which makes you save or die.  You make your save you take 6d6. <br />
<br />
The answer to the riddle is ~ nothing.<br />
<br />
So if you say nothing or dont issue a sound you have come up with a correct answer.<br />
<br />
Congratulations and welcome to the cult.<br />
