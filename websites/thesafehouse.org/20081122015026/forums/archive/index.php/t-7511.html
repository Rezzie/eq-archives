Easy to get (kinda) Go to guard valon and hand in orc pawn picks or go to FP and hand in df belts till you get amaible faction. I got mine today, bad ass. Looks like bright Red banded. Sure messes with pkers minds when they kill you for your tunic and its no drop   I'm working on squad ring next. Next no drop piece.</div></div><hr />

I got it on my bard when he was lvl 15 way back in 1999. I was totally uber because back then it was the only tinted chain besides BI armor. I even did the faction getting orc pawn picks!<br />
<br />
.. and I too am very tempted to get back into EQ, I was once in the rogue only guild on my server a long time ago before everyone became high lvl and quit. It was so much fun all being newbie rogues and ranting about or disgust in druids and such. Edited by: Tular the Most Ill at: 4/26/01 7:47:10 pm</div></div><hr />

Also if anyone knows the stats to the Myrlokar BP and the rough cost on Vallon Zek, I would appreciate the info=)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is a link to a guide I created for Shanks to get their tunics. <br />
<br />
www.angelfire.com/games/s...tunic.html<br />
<br />
I will most likely be adding it as part of the regular Shanks website.  It includes: names of NPCs, tips on faction gathering, including the spy, the fisherman, etc, are all included as well as graphics on where to find the key NPCs.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Hehe after all this time I just noticed I had the wrong name in the table portion: Captian Harvek should be Captain Hazran (you can see his name in the picture below). Edited by: Fricka  at: 5/7/01 12:12:47 am</div></div><hr />
