<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Durden</div><div class="date">08-20-02, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a low-mid lvl guide I put together for those looking for some guidance on what to get next.  I tried to keep it to the pre-planes crowd, so no uber items on the list.  Tried to keep it to items a full group of lvl30's could camp, with a 3kpp item thrown in here or there if they were lucky enough to save their coppers.<br />
<br />
Does this mean you should have all these armor pieces?  No, this list is just a guideline.  You, the player, add individuality to your character.  The following list of armor pieces are suggestions as to what low-mid level armors will help you get to the Woven Shadow, Mrylokar's and Velious Quest stage.<br />
<br />
Again, I'd like to mention.  <br />
<br />
THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE LIST OF UPGRADES.  This list is provided to give those players in their late teen-early twenties some goals to work for.  This list can also provide players that are pre-planes with some good ideas for upgrades until they get to the Woven Shadow, Mrylokar, and Velious quest armors!!<br />
<br />
Please note that full suits of Lightcrawler, Ry’Gorr or Ravenscale are also acceptable pre-planes.  Most of this armor can be purchased for cheap in the Luclin Bazaar.  Also please note, a haste item can be added to any of the following slots: hands (Silver Chitin Hand Wraps (AC10, +3Str, +3Agi, +3Dex, +3 to all Resist, Effect: Haste, Cost ~ 4-5kpp)), waist (Fine Black Silk Sash (AC0, Effect: Haste, Cost ~ 1-3kpp), Hangman's Noose (AC5, Effect: Haste, No Drop)) or head (Hangman's Noose(AC5, Effect: Haste, No Drop)).Fingers  <br />
It’s a SAFE bet to go with the Velium Fire Wedding Rings (AC6, +65Hp, Cost ~ 350-450pp each).  These are player made, so they should be rather easy to find.  If you are hurting for money, save up, these are worth every copper. Many lvl60 Rogues still wear these.  <br />
<br />
If you can’t afford these, you could go with Jagged Bands (AC5, +3Str, Cost 30pp each) for the AC and Str until you have enough money.  At the proper levels, look into starting the Coldain Ring Quests and the Chardock Ring Quest.Hands  <br />
Iksar Scale Gloves (AC10, +5Str, +5Dex, +10Hp, Cost ~100pp) are perfectly acceptable pre-50.  After lvl50 you can camp Crystal Chitin Gauntlets (AC20, +10Str, +35Mana, Cost ~ 2kpp) if you are still looking to add Str.  <br />
<br />
If you have choosen to use a FBSS, or any specific item that has low AC, you may want to pick up a pair of Forhal Gauntlets (AC25, +2% Pick Lock, No Drop) in Maiden's Eye.  As these have a healthy AC boost.Ears <br />
Orc Fang Earings (AC3, +3Str, +15Hp, Cost ~25pp each). They have AC, Str and Hp - what's there NOT to like. And they'll be the easiest and cheapest upgrade you make.Face <br />
If you have Luclin head to Hollowshade Moor. Kill everything in the red area and eventually Gorehorn (lvl30 Beetle, very mean with lots of Hp for the lvl) will show up. Kill Gorehorn and hope he drops the Horned Bettle Mask (AC6, +4Str, +3Sta, +6Mr, +6Pr, Cost ~800-1kpp). Longest I had to wait to get a mask is about an hour (got it for my twink). <br />
<br />
Or if you are extremely short on money, buy or kill for a HQ Cougar Skin in Iceclad, or Eastern Wastes.  Now buy or loot two Mammoth Meats (the ones from Everfrost will work too) and Quest for a Cougarskin Mask (AC6, +2Dex, +2Agi, +10Hp, No Drop) from the gnolls in Iceclad. <br />
<br />
If looking to add more Hp, the Enshrouded Veil, (AC7, +2Wis, +2Int, +30Mana, +30Hp, +10Fr, Effect: Summoning Efficiency III, Cost ~2kpp).  <br />
<br />
A rite of passage for most rogues is getting their Mask of Deception (AC4, +13Cha, +7Mr, Effect: Illusion Dark Elf, No Drop).  This can be done at almost any lvl, as they normally rot if there isn't a bard or rogue in the zone to loot it.  Please see this thread about camping the Mask of Deception.  <br />
<br />
Many high lvl rogues use Crystal Eyes (AC8, +2Int, +2Wis, +35Hp, +35Mana, Cost ~ 1-2kpp) for the face as it offers excellent AC and Hp.  If you can find it cheap, it's a great investment.Neck  <br />
Spider Fur Collar (AC10, +7Str, +7Cr, +7Pr, Cost ~250-500pp) or a RyGorr Collar (AC9, +4Sta, +4Mr, Cost ~ 100pp) are both decent neck items and common. Both will also suffice until you can get something better.  <br />
<br />
That something better could be a Clattering Bone Necklace (AC8, +6Str, +6Sta, +30Hp, Cost ~ 500-1.5kpp).  An excellent option for those looking to add more Hp.Shoulders  <br />
Crested Spaulders (AC11, +6Sta, Cost ~150pp), Tattered Mantle (AC12, +20Hp, +10Dr, Cost ~ 150pp), Sebilite Scale Mantle (AC8, +4Str, +4Sta, +2Fr, +2Dr, Cost ~ 300pp) are three good options.  <br />
<br />
Just remember, you'll loot an Obulus Mantle (AC10, +5Str, +5Sta, +30Mana, No Drop) your first trip into the Sebilis Crypt (if you want it), so there's no need to spend a ton of money here.Head  <br />
Several options. You can look for any of the following: Lieutenant's Helm (AC10, +4Str, +5Dex, Cost ~100pp, drops in Kael if you want to work on faction too), RyGorr Chain Coif (AC13, +3Str, +3Mr, Cost ~100pp) or Crested Helm (AC10, +6Str, +3Cha, Cost ~200pp).  <br />
<br />
There is a very nice Helm that drops in Tower of Frozen Shadow, but a full group of lvl40’s would be suggested to get it, Spiked Velium Skull Helm (AC10, +5Str, +5Cha, +20Mana, +5 to all resists, No Drop).Arms  <br />
Mrylokar Vambracers (AC18, Effect: Strength of Earth, Cost ~1kpp) and Crystal Chitin Vambracers (AC18, +5Str, +5Sta, +10Hp, Cost ~2kpp) are both common.  No reason not to have one or the other at least.  Even if you can't use the buff effect of the Mrylokar's Vambracers, the AC is well worth the investment as it's almost like you're wearing another BP on your arms.  <br />
<br />
Also, if you're looking for more Hp for your arm slot, try Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves (AC16, +6Str, +6Sta, +6Dex, +5Cr, +25Hp, Cost ~ 2-3.5kpp).  These are a bit pricier then the other two options, but give more stat boost and Hp.Wrist  <br />
The Ice Forge Shackle (AC10, +5Str, +5Dex, +5Agi, +30Hp, No Drop) Quest is nice, but large races can’t wear. A Bracer of Scavenging (AC9, +5Sta, +5Dex, Cost ~150-200pp) would be good option, and a Bracer of Erollisi (AC5, +5Str, cost ~ 20pp) or Hero Bracers (AC9, +10Str, +5Pr, +5Dr, Cost ~ 300-500pp) both have some nice Str to them.Waist  <br />
If you want, a Spider Fur Belt (AC10, +5Dex, +5Agi, +40Hp, Cost ~ 300-500pp) is a nice for the Hp.  If you want to see the Frogluk Warden you could camp a Troll-Hide Belt (AC5, +5Str, +5Sta, Cost ~100pp) in Upper Guk, please see this thread for more information.  <br />
<br />
Also, a Ravenscale Belt (AC9, +5Sta, +25Hp, Cost ~ 700-1.5kpp) is a nice option, or the Thick Banded Belt for the Str impaired (AC8, +15Str, Cost ~under 1kpp).  Also the Harness of Grey Flesh, (AC12 +5Sta, +20Hp, +20Mana, +10Cr, Cost ~ Under 1kpp) from Luclin is a very nice belt.  Any of these will last for quite a few lvls.Back  <br />
The Spider Fur Cloak (AC10, +4Str, +4Sta, +6Cr, Cost ~300-500pp) and the Dire-Wolf Hide Cloaks (AC8, +6Str, +6Sta, +35Hp, Cost ~ 1kpp) are both nice. A Dire-wolf Hide Cloak can be a good stop-gap until you can find a Cloak of the Maelstorm (AC11, +3Str, +6Sta, +10Dex, +5Int, +55Hp, Cost ~3.5kpp).    <br />
<br />
Also, for those in the mid to late 30's can camp the giants in Kael (the giants near the EW zone) with a full group for a Giant Scale Mail Cloak (AC7, +5Sta, +30Hp, +10Mana, Cost ~ 300-700pp).Chest: <br />
<br />
Ry'Gorr Chainmail (AC18, +10Str, Cost ~300-400pp) is serviceable, but if you can wear it, a Treeweave (AC25, +10Str, Cost ~under 1kpp) is a cheap upgrade. It will last until you get a Barbed Ringmail, Woven Shadow Chestgaurd or something better.Boots  <br />
For the money Sebilite Boots (AC12, +4Sta, +4Int, +2MR, +2Cr, Cost ~200-300pp) are awesome. <br />
<br />
Or if you want free, head to Maiden's eye on Luclin and help camp the Coterie. They have an uncommon drop, Shrouded Boots (AC12, +4Str, +4Sta, +4Agi, +4Dex, +4Int, +4Wis, +4Cha, No Drop). Everytime I've camped the Coterie, at least one pair has rotted.  If you can’t help, stay out of the way, and ask nicely if you can have a pair of unwanted boots.  <br />
<br />
If you're looking for +Str and don't want to risk staying hidden at the Coterie Camp, you can always buy Shissar Scale Boots (AC10, +5Str, +5Agi, +5Dex, Cost ~1kpp) Legs  <br />
Ry'Gorr (AC13, +2 Sta, +2 Dex, +3 vsMg, +5 vsCold, +5 HP, Cost ~150pp) and Ravenscale (AC12, +5Sta, +5Dr, Cost ~100pp) are both nice options, but I'd go with Ravenscale, as the sta boost is nicer.  <br />
<br />
Next step up over these would be Kylong Greaves (AC16, +4Str, Cost ~ 500-1000pp) or Sebilite Scale Leggings (AC16, +4Str, +4Wis, +2Fr, +2Pr, Cost ~ 1-1.5kpp).  <br />
<br />
Or if you have the money to burn, get one of the Dragonleg Breeches (Cost ~ 3.5-9kpp).  They all have great AC, some Sta and some Dex.Range  <br />
Free - Eye of Trust (AC5, +2Str, +2Dex, +2Wis, +2Int, No Drop, Quested out of Sanctus Seru) or a Goranga Idol (AC8, +3Sta, +4Dex, +25Hp, Cost ~500-750pp, or free if you hunt the Goranga's in Maiden Eye).  <br />
<br />
If you are lacking some of the more common resists (Mr, Cr or Fr), you may want to camp a Rune Bone Fork (Dmg5, Dly30, +10Mr, +10Fr, +10Cr, Cost ~ 800pp) in Upper Guk.Weapons  <br />
You could buy a Crystalline Spider Fang (Dmg 10, Dly 22, +3Str, +10Pr, Effect: Velium Shards, Cost ~500-800pp) as they are very common. Or you could buy a Shaded Dagger (Dmg 11, Dly22, +5Mr, +5Cr, +5Pr, +5Dr, -5Fr, Cost:~1-1.5kpp), or quest of the Rozzut’s Whistler (Dmg 11, Dly 22, +3Sta, +3Agi, No Drop, Cost ~ a little time and 500pp). <br />
<br />
You may want to pick up a Centi Shortsword (Dmg 12, Dly 25, +5Str, +5Sta, Cost ~ 200-300pp) to work on 1 hand slash, and a Blackjack (Dmg 7, Dly 21, Cost ~100pp) to work on 1 hand blunt.For those that like the Black Armor look of Ravenscale.  There are some other armors that will give a black/dark look  to them; Blackened Alloy from Runneyeye, Giant Scale Mail from Kael, Black Ice Greaves and Arms from Velketor's Labyrrinth, and Mrylokar's Armor from various zones in Kunark.
