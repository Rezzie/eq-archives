<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">05-30-06, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should be there, nice full cast and some percocet.  Oh, the doctor in the hospital was shocked when I told him percocet didn't do much for me so he gave me a scrip for me in case I run out.  When I saw the notes that came with the pills I found out why he was shocked.<br />
<br />
 Percocet is OXYCODONE!<br />
<br />
Famous people get hooked on that **** and it does nothing to me.  PHEAR ME!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">05-30-06, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The swelling is down a good bit, color also returning back to normal.  Not sure they will give a scrip for anything stronger, most if that stuff they give in hospitals.  I know when he was going to put on the cast he cleaned the area with alcohol and then rubber the area with a bit of lotion and man did that hurt.  Then he stuck me with an IV needle and pumped in some for of medicine hat kicked in after like 10 seconds and I felt no pain while wrapping the cast.  When he stoped the meds pain was back in like 2 minutes.  Not sure what was in that syringe but that was the ****.  No loopy drugged up feelings, but no pain for the first time in a week and a half for those breif minutes.<br />
<br />
So cast for 5 weeks, then back for a check up.</div></div><hr />
