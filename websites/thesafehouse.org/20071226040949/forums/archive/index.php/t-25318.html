God I hate this ******* show.  I haven't hated a main character this much since Shinji, and I REALLY ******* HATE Shinji!!<br />
Please explain? i've watched up to episode 43, and i love this show, it really becomes quite good around episode 20+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-23-06, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well there you go.  I've only seen up to episode 15 so far.  He's a really whiney kid.  He has, like, 10 minute internal dialogs where he miscomprehends the feelings of everyone around him.  And he's contantly pining over a girl who is, frankly, more creepy than anything.  I mean, the show is about skyboarding robots, which they do for like 30 seconds an episode, then we go back him whiney cause nobody gets him.<br />
<br />
So does he die in episode 20?  That would make this show alot better!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darcean</div><div class="date">07-24-06, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol.. no.. just watch, or dl the fansubs.. *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">07-24-06, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for you, Darth.  I got them from the Eureka 7 trailer on my Bebop Remix DVD.   I especially like the screen cap of 'psycho girl':</div></div><hr />

Like I'm supposed to know that?  My knowledge of Eureka 7 consists of the trailer in the Bebop Remix DVD.  I think the first two pics would make pretty entertaining avatars though:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tabbran</div><div class="date">07-25-06, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it's really a spoiler, since it happened in like the 3rd episode or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">07-26-06, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could certainly be wrong, those early episodes were dreadfully dull, but I'm pretty sure they were entirely focused on the Gekko.  Anemone was introduced just a couple weeks ago (Adult Swim time) and we haven't heard anything about her backstory yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've watched a couple episodes on Adult Swim, and I have no idea what the hell is going on.  But for some reason, I get the unmistakable feeling that it sucks.  <br />
<br />
Ah, well.  Adult Swim is like that.  For every Bebop, there's a Blue Gender.  Or a Pilot Candidate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darcean</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its slow for the first 13 episodes or so.. picks up around 15 or 17.. would have to rewatch the fansubs i have =X.... really picks up around episode 26-27</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eureka Seven is probably the only new mecha anime I've watched to completion since Evangelion and RahXephon. Let alone past the first episode. Take that for what it's worth. I mostly watched the first 20 out of boredom, but it picked up and I enjoyed the last half.</div></div><hr />
