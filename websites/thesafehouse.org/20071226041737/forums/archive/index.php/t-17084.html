<br />
Time Warner and Itochu Corp (C. Itoh &amp;amp; Co.) have announced that they will jointly produce new anime to be broadcast simultaneously on Cartoon Network in Japan and North America.<br />
<br />
By April 2006, the joint venture is expected to be producing weekly episodes for three shows, at a budget of 20 million yen ($US 190,000) per episode, 20 to 50 percent higher than the current average budget for anime TV series. The added budget will be spent on higher-than-average quality animation using more animators and other staff than is typically used in anime.<br />
<br />
By June 2005, the joint venture is expected to be set up with a fund of 3 billion yen (US$29 million) and will seek funding from other partners including broadcasters, animation studios, and toy manufacturers.<br />
<br />
In addition to producing the anime, the companies expect to profit from the development and marketing of related merchandise. Guaranteed spots on the American and Japanese Cartoon Networks, combined with the worldwide popularity of anime, is expected to insure better than average returns on investment, enticing investors.<br />
<br />
The anime series will also be marketed to international broadcasters in Europe and Asia. <br />
<br />
A lot of interesting comments on this are here (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?discuss=6072).</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the bright side, if it all completely bombs we can blame it on the lack of buzz from the fansubs that normally precedes an anime on TV here in the US.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what to think about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">02-01-05, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if something as large as time warner can really turn out anything that's going to have merit. Anime by commitee blows. But if it's running in Japan as well, they must be fairly confident in their product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">02-01-05, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im expecting good art because of the increased budget but crap writing because they will hire someone who has no idea what the word Anime even means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">02-01-05, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This post from the ANN thread seems dangerously close to what may happen.<br />
<br />
Concurrent release is cool. The fact that Time Warner is putting money into the industry is cool. The contention comes from the fact that Time Warner is putting in a LOT of money. 190,000 USD per episode is a crap load of money. FLCL was around 150,000 an ep, and it's an OVA. So saying Time Warner won't want anything to do with planning and creation is like saying FOX is making more Family Guy because they see the creative merit of the show. Business is all about money. Television is a business. If Time Warner wants to make the big money, they'll probably want to do something a bit more all-encompassing.  I'd sooner expect more shows like D.I.C.E, pokemon, digimon, beyblade, and duel monsters then Cowboy Bebop, Paranoia Agent, or even Full Metal Alchemist. They want to make a crap load on merchandise. They need a show with a crap load of merchandise.  <br />

I'm sure you could hire the best-or at least very close to the best- animators, story writers, producers .etc for a LOT less than $29 million. Hell, be generous, give everyone on the staff $200k a year. I'm just not seeing where all this cash is going.</div></div><hr />
