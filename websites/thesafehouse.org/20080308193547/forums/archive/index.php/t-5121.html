I would suggest lowering stealth to 38-39 and also dropping your dual-wield in order to bring up your weapon specs.  <br />
<br />
Your weapon spec determines your base damage for all your attacks including critical strikes.<br />
<br />
Not saying that you couldn't make it work, but I think you would find the damage output a little disappointing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">07-17-02, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's really up to you.  In my opinion dual-wield has the least return of any skills we have.  The dual-wield styles are pretty worthless for an infiltrator, so the only thing you gain from it is .5% chance for your off-hand to attack per point you spend in it.  This is nice at low levels when it does not cost many points, but as it gets higher it gets very costly for little benefit.<br />
<br />
My dual-wield is only 7, but I know many infiltrators that have gone higher and been happy with it.  It's really a matter of preference.  I only mentioned it because you need to salvage points from somewhere if you are going to spend them on both weapon specs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_artaemis4324</div><div class="date">07-17-02, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, i have used the character builder 1.3 again and came up with this template.<br />
<br />
Stealth:40<br />
Envenom:30<br />
CS:50<br />
Slashing:33<br />
Thrust:32<br />
Duel Wield<br />
<br />
How does that one sound?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">07-17-02, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks pretty good to me.  your damage will still be a little on the low side fromweapon spec, but much of that will be made up by the ability to choose an appropriate damage type.  With this template you are running at about 2/3 weapon spec to your level.  That is about the minimum I would recommend to any assassin.</div></div><hr />
