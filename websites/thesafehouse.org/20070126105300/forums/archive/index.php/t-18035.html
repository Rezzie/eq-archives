<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowood</div><div class="date">03-27-05, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just turned level 40. I have saved enough to get my horse but I have no money and my gear is on the very weak side. Anyone have some tips for making some money or any quest I could work on for gear. Am using 2 deadly kris of the monkey at the moment. I think my weapons need upgraded first then the rest of my gear. Any tips at all would be great.  I am pretty new to wow this is my first character. I am a human rogue btw and I have leatherworking/skinning as profession. On a side note, should I drop my leatherworking, atm is seems a waste can buy stuff that is much better it seems, and none of the items I can make sell.  I just made my first voodoo mask not sure what skill level that is, I am away from home for a week or so. OK enough rambling...<br />

I'm seriously considering dropping leatherworking and going gatherer with enchanting/skinning, and just selling the shards i get from disenchants.  At 40, the best thing i could tell you is to go farm BFD/Deadmines/wailing caverns for loot, you can take out most everything in any of them.  For weapons, at 40 you can go party up in SM for the Black Menace quest, i'm almost 44 and still use it, believe it's 29 and change DPS, and go farm the guy in gnomeregan for the toxic revenger, it's a pretty common drop but if you get the shitty staff it sells nice too.  The first rounds of quests in STV are just easy kill tasks, and everything you kill for them is skinnable.  Sell the stacks instead of using them for crappy items that nobody will buy.  Good XP, plenty of leather, and money for quest turnins.  should only be a few gold a pop for new weapons in the AH to hold you over, and leather armor sells real cheap on my server seeing everyone and their mother is a mail wearer.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">03-28-05, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check out the Weapon List thread (http://www.thesafehouse.org/viewtopic.php?t=18160). It lists a lot of daggers, swords, and maces that are good for rogues, along with the level for it and details of how to get it. Just as something to compare to, I got a pair of Tigerbane (http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=1465)s for 2g and change (for both, not each), and had them waiting for me when I hit 33. It's not a whole lot more DPS, but the higher damage on the weapon makes for higher special attacks. Toxic Revenger from Gnomer is the same damage/delay, but a different effect, and usable at 27. You should really do the SM quest (starts in Desolace by killing undead) for Sword of Serenity (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6829) or Black Menace (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6831). Both are quite good, depending on how you want to do things. Hypnotic Blade from Arcanist Doan (he guards the key to the other instances, but you don't have to kill him for the quest) in SM is good too, but you'll have to fight the casters over it because of the stats. =) If you can get another rogue to help you out, you should be able to sneak back there and kill him without bothering with anything else.<br />

I was doing SM at 40 for my mount money. Even the regular junk mobs outside the building carry a lot of coin, and everything can be pickpocketed for even more money. I could get 2-3g per run.</div></div><hr />
