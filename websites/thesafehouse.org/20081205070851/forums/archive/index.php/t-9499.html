<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IanY</div><div class="date">05-29-04, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if one of the safehouse WoW beta testers could time Energy recharge from 0 to 100 with a stopwatch.<br />
<br />
The reason I ask this is because I've heard way too many variations in the recharge time of energy. They range from 6seconds to 20seconds from zero to full. This is a pretty big variation in reports :(<br />
<br />
It would take less than a minute to test, and you could do it on a weak monster so you have no chance of dying.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to get my head around how important our special attacks are to combat. Energy recharge plays a major role in this. A most basic example is if you were repeatedly doing sinister strikes as soon as your energy allowed (ie every 45 energy). Say you did on average 50 damage per sinister strike. If energy recharge was 6seconds, your DPS from sinister stikes would be 50dmg per 2.7seconds = 18.5DPS. If your energy recharge was 20s, your DPS from sinisters would be 5.6DPS.<br />
<br />
So it makes a big difference, I'm an unlucky sod without a beta, and I'm dying to know an accurate an answer.<br />
<br />
Can a kind beta tester please put me out of my misery?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-29-04, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It takes about 6 or 7 seconds for a rogue to fill the energy bar.  Casters don't use energy, but their mana replenishes more slowly (which is probably where the 20 second number comes from).<br />
<br />
But the problem with trying to calculate dps is that the energy regains in blocks (of I'd guess around 20 energy/tick) instead of a constant flow so actual dps would be less than theoretical dps.  In addition, every move has a replenishment timer of its own before it can be used again, so for example you can't just repeatedly sinister strike.<br />
<br />
And just to discourage you even more, remember this is beta - it's not guaranteed to be the same for release, and all the classes are going to be getting their fair share of attention before the game goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IanY</div><div class="date">05-29-04, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for answering so quickly. I think I understand a bit better why no one has given a precise time for recharge.<br />
<br />
But the problem with trying to calculate dps is that the energy regains in blocks (of I'd guess around 20 energy/tick) instead of a constant flow so actual dps would be less than theoretical dps. In addition, every move has a replenishment timer of its own before it can be used again, so for example you can't just repeatedly sinister strike. <br />
<br />
I was under the impression that the replenishment timer for most opening moves was 1 to 1.5s (with notable exceptions like gouge), so that if you were repeatedly spamming your sinister hotkey it would end up being energy recharge not cooldown that would be the limiting factor.<br />
<br />
Also I figured that if you were playing your rogue optimally then you would be pressing your sinister strike hotkey before your energy bar reached 100 and despite your energy recharging in blocks you would never let it hit full and sit idly. So in that optimal situation your theoretical DPS would equal actual DPS.<br />
<br />
However I figure since I have never played a rogue and am talking hypothetical situations I've never been in I could also be quite wrong.<br />
<br />
And just to discourage you even more, remember this is beta<br />
<br />
I know. I'm just the sort of person who wants to know exact figures even if they are going to be subject to change. (and then I'd want to know the exact changed figure :) )</div></div><hr />
