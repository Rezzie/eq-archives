<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Quaysh</div><div class="date">05-07-02, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have a question or two about the 'torch'. I am wondering about its effect on stealth (if any) in both PvE and RvR. From experimentation I know that if someone else near me has their torch on, it doesn't light up the area for me, however it does seem to light up the person with the torch (at least it did on an unstealthed person, not sure about a stealthed person or someone from another realm). So,<br />
<br />
1) In RvR, will someone from another realm be able to see you easier if you have your torch on while stealthed?<br />
<br />
2) In PvE does having your torch on make it easier for monsters to uncover you?<br />
<br />
And are there any video settings, dynamic lighting etc., that have any effect on this? Forgive me if there was a previous post on this, a search didnt turn it up.</div></div><hr />
