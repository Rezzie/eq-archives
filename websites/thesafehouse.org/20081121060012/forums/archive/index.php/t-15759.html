<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lashiec</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) button queueing (which does not stay OFF if you select it.)  button queuing is of course a  good idea in principle - but with a large majority of players simply  mashing buttons its just a beautiful method of botching HO's.<br />
<br />
2)chat filters: enough said<br />
<br />
3) experience debt + inviting people at a distance (since it is  about the only way to get new group members.to the group)  someone gets croaked en route to you,  why should you suffer the exp debt?  for christmas i want a radius for the penalty - or preferably such that if you arent on the mobs aggro list, you dont suffer the exp debt penalty. and on an asside, how would this work on a multi group raid? i dont even want to fathom what it would be like to get 20+ exp death penalties <br />
<br />
4) The  map system.  due to  shoddy framerates (and i can imagine many others are forced to do this periodically)  i spend alot of my time   looking at the ground and navigating by the map (quite like bazaar in eq1) but the geniuses at SoE decided to make the  icon on the map one of  the only shapes which do not show which direction your headed.  this is especially brutal when your computer stutters and you completely lose track of where you are headed (normally this wouldnt be a problem, but the compass is clearly  unreadable)  why they chose a  red DOT to mark you on the map is absolutely beyond me<br />
<br />
5) intermediate ingredients in trade skills (tempers, wash's etc) if you are an armorsmith for example, and you  need a temper to make something out of iron, you shouldnt be forced to go to a craftsman to make this for you (read as: get completely fleeced on each purchase).  If it was a jewel or a special type of blade imbued with magic i could understand it.. but a fricking temper? give me a break.  If its simply easier to make an alt mule to do the combines for the intermediate ingredients - rather than find a seller why not just allow the outfitter to create the finished good from scratch?<br />
<br />
all in all the game is what i expected it to be, thoroughly engrossing and quite alot of fun.  but it is the little annoyances which really, really cause significant underjoy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tannier</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The group debt issue is indeed a serious one.<br />
<br />
I can certainly understand the concept: &quot;Hey let's make it so that helping each other stay alive is a group activity and give them incentive to do so&quot;<br />
<br />
Here are some examples of when it totally fails to match up to the drawing board concept:<br />
<br />
1)  Group gets wiped out in a articularly bad spot.   Healer has to log for a date and due to lack of replacement healer and it's getting late, group breaks up.  Noone having recoverd the corpse, this leaves the whole group, even those willing to stay and recover, with a ton of debt that is absolutely not their own fault.<br />
<br />
2) As described above.  new group member invited from 16 miles away puts on autorun and heads from qeynos to TS to meet you.  Along the way manages to get dead due to sheer lack of paying attention.  WHy should the 5 members of the group waiting for him have to be penalized.<br />
<br />
3) In a dungeon, twitchy caster keeps peeking into other rooms and getting aggro and getting dead.  Why am I constantly being penalized for his stupidity?  Isn't it bad enough the group has to res and heal him, making us less effective?  Does noone understand the in-game repurcussions of saying &quot;you are a bad group mate and give us debt, you are being ejected from the group&quot;?  Not the least of which is getting a replacement down to where you are in the dungeon when you hit that particular level of frustration in order to take action?  <br />
<br />
4) If you play at odd times, you may go through hours when you cannot get a group reconstituted after having some to go and recover your body from a bad spot.  You get penalties to stats on top of the lovely debt.</div></div><hr />

First of all the group exp debt does not increase if people do not get their shards. I.E. the debt incurred is only that debt which you'd have  before the shard debt.  Each person incurs shard debt individually.  Shard debt is not shared.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is simple, do not invite group members from miles away unless you trust their ability to get to you.  I'd be hesitant to invite any member to my group who did not already know the way to where I am.  And know how to get their safely.<br />

Twitchy caster never gets invited to a group again.  This system not only encourages working together, but those who constantly die due to their own stupidity will soon find they cannot get groups.  That frankly, I like.<br />

You only get stat loss if you fail to get your shard.  In three days time the stat loss goes away even if you fail to get your shard.  Death hurts.  Death really hurts.  But death does not hurt as much as it did in EQ if you couldn't get your corpse back.</div></div><hr />

My roommate almost quit because of that.  He absolutely hated the fact that you have to rely on someone for temper --- he plays really late a lot of the time and almost no one on ever sells it when he needs it  :hmph <br />
<br />
My pet peeve?<br />
<br />
Can't drag your spirit.  I died 6x trying to get my 1st shard away from a group of sodden bones near the beach in Antonica.  Finally I had a guildmate lure them away so I could swim in and get it.<br />
<br />
Also...<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned in another post something that I dislike as well: no maps in dungeons and whatnot.  It would be nice to have them so I didn't have to keep switching back and forth between the game and website with maps on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the debt share system could use a little work.<br />
<br />
For example, my shaman got invited into a group last night, and as soon as I was invited somebody in the group died and I got debt.  Gee, thanks.  I've been in this group for 1 minute and I'm safely sitting by the guards, but didn't happen to realize that all group members weren't nearby and not acting stupid so I get some debt.  :(<br />
<br />
Personally, I think there should be a radius.  If a group member is far enough away, they get their own debt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nubbin</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, shared debt should follow the risk/reward concept.<br />
<br />
If you aren't in range to get xp if the mob dies, you shouldn't be able to get xp debt if a group member dies as long as you were never on the mob's hate list.  <br />
<br />
You should not be penalized if you can't be rewarded.<br />
