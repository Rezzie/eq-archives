The eerie calm just hours before had been shattered by forlorn howling winds and violent waves. The helmsman tried despratly to keep the ships stern to the waves but the churning seas tossed the boat around like a toy. Dark clouds moved in to block the frail moon and to send lightning dancing menacingly around the darkend sky. The cold wind batterd sailors could do nothing but give one last prayer to prexus and prepare for the worst. With one stroke a giant among waves hundreds of fet tall toppled uppon the ship.  Men were swept screaming into the cold dark sea and the ship gave one last agonizing groan as it split down the middle. In an hours time the winds began to calm and the storm disperesd. Dawn broke reluctently on the secene where nothing but a few floating pieces of driftwood and one empty barrel remained to tell the account of the poor vessel.<br />
