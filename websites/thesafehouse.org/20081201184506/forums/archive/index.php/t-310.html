<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Taffey</div><div class="date">03-24-00, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I'm a longtime reader, but first time poster.  I just love the Rogue stories, and, even thought I am pretty low level, wanted to contribute something.<br />
<br />
When I first created my Rogue, another new character asked me what class I was.  (You have to guess how old the other character was, but of course I didn't know.) Conversavtion went something like this:<br />
<br />
Taffey:  &quot;I'm a bard.&quot;<br />
Newbie:  &quot;No!  I didn't know Halflings could be bards!&quot;<br />
Taffey:  &quot;Sure we can.  Watch.&quot;<br />
/em begins to sing a song.<br />
/em 's song ends!<br />
Newbe:  (inspects Taffey) &quot;If you're a Bard then how come the /who says you're a Rogue?&quot;<br />
Taffey:  &quot;Well, I went to the guild in the Fool's Gold.  But they were out of Bard's tunics, so they gave me this as a temporary replacement.&quot;<br />
Newbie:  &quot;LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Much later, at a lofty level 6, I had purchased a large sewing kit but my mighty Halfling intellect of 67 had betrayed me and I had blown three pelts in a row without creating a single piece of patchwork.  There was a high level Erudite outside the bank in Rivervale and I asked him if he could tailor me some armor.  I had skins, and was willing to pay.  The Erudie apologized, and the conversation went like this:<br />
<br />
Erudite:  &quot;Sorry, I don't tailor.&quot;<br />
/em Taffey counterfeits 10 gold.<br />
Erudite  &quot;How did you do that?&quot;<br />
Taffey:  &quot;Oh, it's a new skill we rogues get.&quot;<br />
Erudite:  &quot;And it works?&quot;<br />
Taffey:  &quot;Yeah, I already have a skill of 36.  The only problem is that counterfeit gold is NO DROP.&quot;<br />
Erudite:  &quot;What good is it, then?&quot;<br />
Taffey:  &quot;Not much.  But there is one merchant that accepts counterfeit gold in return for counterfeit food.&quot;<br />
Erudite:  &quot;Counterfeit food?  I never heard of that.&quot;<br />
Taffey:  &quot;It looks just like real food, only you can't eat it.&quot;<br />
Erudite:  &quot;So WHAT GOOD IS IT?  What good is counterfeit money and what good is counterfeit food?&quot;<br />
Taffey:  &quot;Well, nothing in EQ is perfect.&quot;<br />
Erudite:  &quot;Wait here a minute kid.  I got something for you.&quot; (goes into the bank, comes back and hands Taffey 8 pp.) &quot;Here, kid, go buy yourself some armor.&quot;<br />
