<br />
If a move requires an evade, then you need to evade in order for it to be triggered successfully (evident!).<br />
<br />
My question is the following: I read elsewhere that if a target is stunned, you can make a move that requires a condition (like evade!) to work properly and it will work...<br />
<br />
Is this true?<br />
<br />
This comes from another thread where a person was saying how he could chain dragonfang/hamstring/leaper/hamstring/leaper/ribseperation/ripper... dragonfang and hamstring both require evade, so it must be possible because of the stun component on dragonfang...<br />
<br />

Once the stun effect kicks in, as long as the target is stunned, you should be able to continue to perform and chain evade type styles. Ie... If you could evade a target then stun them indefinitely, you could continue to perform evade styles ad nauseum. Grevan Greylock, 43rd Level Cleric, Percival Server, Ring of Steel<br />

evade, diamondback, hamstring, leaper...<br />

seems to work very well, and gives me a very good chance to evade again, rinse, and repeat.<br />

I am pretty sure it works since many people are doing it, but there must be a catch. I dont think you can perform evade style indefinitely when the target is stunned since in that case, you would be able to stack up dragonfang without end and this is not right.<br />
<br />
There is something we miss.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the last thing they did before getting stunned was attack and get evaded by you, then yes, you can perform evade styles until their next swing.  It's not indefinite, though, since diminishing returns code halves the duration of any sleep effect every time it is used on the same target after the first, and players can only be stunned once per minute.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gannex</div><div class="date">05-02-02, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is purely fictional situation situation:<br />
<br />
You are soloing. There is nothing else for the mob to aggro/hit. You evade. The mob suddenly stops hitting for the rest of the battle. You can use the weapon style that chains off of evade as many times as you want until that mob does something.<br />
<br />
Another purely fictional situation:<br />
<br />
You are in a group. The mob your group is fighting turns to you and you evade, but then turns back to the main tank. You can use the style that chains off of evade as long as the mob has not done anything else. Point: just because your evade was the last action the mob performed on you, does not mean that it was the last action performed by the mob. &quot;Here is a hand full of warnings..
