<br />
On the Bgrounds when I was 29, I didn't get any face offs without interference, but the damage didn't seem to be that off.  I went up against a Sac- neither of us got a Crit off, but with his DW quicker attacks and a higher poison than me, I think he was doing about the same damage as me... and then some stinking archer ganked me  <br />
<br />
I do love the 2H opener though.</div></div><hr />

Sanya: &quot;God yeah, that's what we're working on right now. That's why this 1.48 is coming out. We really, REALLY, I swear to God, but nobody believes me, intended that, a level 20 shouldn't really have much of a shot, but a 30… should be able to at least hit a 40, and a 40 should have a shot at a 50. And stuff did not work out that way… but one of the big things we're working out right now is how to fix that, you know, so a level 35 can go into RvR and not get killed like a fish out of water.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mistwolf: &quot;Wait, you mean we're not supposed to get killed in one hit in RvR?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sanya: &quot;Noo…You're not! There should be no one-shot RvR things.&quot; <br />
*** <br />
<br />
So far from being one-shot in RvR as a &quot;How do I spec to...&quot; question (see about 100 &quot;Shadowzerkers&quot; Spec plans)we should be laying plans for how to survive increasingly longer combats! <br />
<br />
And those of us who suffered since L14 bein' one-shot waiting for the day we could &quot;pay back&quot;, well, we hafta suck it up. Apparently the very thing that irritated our younger years is/will be eliminated. Don't spec/plan for/reach for developemental dead ends! <br />
