Or does it start once you leave the inn? Cause I'm guessing that finding a group takes a couple minutes, and then running to the group takes a some more. I was also wondering exactly how long the normal rest level lasts when you're constantly exping in a group. I'm not sure if you guys have the time for testing this stuff out, but I'll be waiting for a reply. Thanks! Vargren Shade - Rogue</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you gain x amount of mob exp, you go to Rested, if you gain x amount more, you go to Normal. Lurik Crim`Tal<br />

You can't gather the necessary supplies in the inn.   You could however do all the gathering and then simply go to the inn and do your combines.  If you've done tradeskills before in EQ (the two systems are very similar) you know that combining takes perhaps 10 minutes while gathering may take 3 hours. Lurik Crim`Tal<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rokktor</div><div class="date">04-27-04, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, there's really two things you can do for 8 hours while you rest:  Jack and Squat.<br />
<br />
In the first 5 minutes you can do all the tradeskill combines.  Combines take no time, for leatherworking I do most of them in the field.  Components are dropped though, so you can't sit there buying skill up components and practicing.  You either go gather the components, or buy them from people who charge outrageous amounts.  <br />
<br />
Haha, 7sp for 20 light leathers the other day I think.  It's insane.  That's like 3 combines if you're skill is around 50.  It would get you from 1-20 though but even 20 combines would take all of 60 seconds.  It's not like EQ where you have to drag stuff into a kit.  If the ingredients are in your bags, you go to your skill menu combine away.  The results drop into your bags so you don't even spend time clicking those away.</div></div><hr />
