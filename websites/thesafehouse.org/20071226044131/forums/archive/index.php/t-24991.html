Worth the money yet I dunno guess it depends on the person heh. But there are a TON of extras so you will be fighting forever getting $$.<br />
<br />
Basically its like Super Smash Bros. on crack hehe. I do hope they port the other ones over as well b/c i can tell they improved it a lot since this first version heh.<br />
<br />
Its One on One but I think they change that in future versions. Im not positive tho heh.<br />
<br />
Mission Mode (tasks you preform for $$. Like beat teh guy in 30 sec, Survive with 80% health &amp; beat the guy etc...), Story mode (story for each char. Basically goes up to the part where the 3rd dies)., Free fighting mode, training mode etc, store, Naruto's house (view the extras you get here). I dunno if its me but even on normal diff the AI seems powerful heh.<br />
<br />
Also the multi-stage stuff is interesting as well. Some stages are interactive and has things pop out and hurt you etc if your near them.<br />
<br />
And sadly there is no JPN voice acting option =/. Altho most of the voices are ok except for Naruto's :P.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">06-29-06, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice, I might actually buy those once they are available here in Germany. Hopefully the feature Japanese, English and German then. :) <br />
<br />
Although by the time they are available in Germany, fillers will have ended *G* So I will most likely end up importing from the US.</div></div><hr />
