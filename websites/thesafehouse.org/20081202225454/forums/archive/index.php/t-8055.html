My question is, has anyone heard weather the new poison procs will be available without PoP?<br />

Personally, I feel ripped off.  When the game first came out poisons didn't work at all. A year later they fixed it so poisons worked but worked badly.  Now they introduce something that has been promised to rogues but are making us pay extra money for a 'bug fix'.<br />
<br />
This is not a new feature.  This is a promised feature that is supposedly now working as intended.  So, why are we being forced to buy and expansion modules for something that should have been available in the original Everquest?<br />

<br />
This isn't a bug fix, rather a new system.  Sure, we all agree that old poisons were a novelty at best.  It cannot be said however that they are &quot;broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just very, very disapointing. -- Lemac Dushae, Guild Leader for the Court of Jesters<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lifty</div><div class="date">10-22-02, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd say this pretty much dances on the line of being &quot;broken&quot;.  good points made by all above.  problem is that VI has admitted that poisons in their pre-PoP state were crap, and that they wanted to do more but couldn't because of the way poisons were coded.  sounds at least semi-broke to me, depends how you look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Senwen1 of Quellious</div><div class="date">10-22-02, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Original poisons weren't broken.   I could make a case that they were better than the current (non PoP) system in fact.  You had to carry fewer components overall and the lower level poisons (putrid bile) did more damage.  Old style putrid bane was worth approx 10 percent damage on a Sol B kobold.<br />
And all I had to do when I ran out was run outside to lavastorm to get more components.  I used it a lot to solo doggies in Sol B when I was younger.  Current Putrid bane is a joke vs Sol B mobs.  Same goes for spider/snake poisons.<br />
The current system was a nice idea, but with the number of components required and lack of pack space, resist rates, etc, it failed miserably.<br />
Obviously, I haven't played with the new buff poisons, but my thoughts atm are that they will only be slightly more usefull than the current system.  There seem to be be fewer overall poison buffs which is good.  However, Vaslin? mentioned that you can use many different combinations of ingredients to arrive at the same poison.  This doesn't sound very promising as far as reducing pack space needed for poison components unless you can get a lot of the same components relatively easily.<br />
Multiple dose potions are a plus, but I have some doubts if they will be worth the pack space (which will be at an even more premium with the NO DROP PoP quest items cluttering it up).   When would I actually USE a poison?  Soloing - probably not.  If the poison meant life or death, I shouldn't be fighting it anyway.   The exp isn't worth the down time/risk.<br />
And depending on procs to win isn't wise.  Snare proc would be useful for runners.  I'd rather see finishing blow land  <br />
Exp groups - probably not.  A well balanced exp group shouldn't need poison procs to win.  Snare poison might be situationally useful if the proc is dependable enough to happen once a fight.  Mana drain poison - get a bard, necro or enchanter.  The chances a proc will happen in time to prevent mob from gating is so silly as to be laughable.  One of the more utterly worthless poisons on the list.  Now a mana drain over time for 450 would be worth using perhaps if the drain per tick was enough to stop gating.  Damage and DOT poisons, nice enough, but not worth premium pack space.  I do more damage in a decent double backstab than I will get from these poisons and it takes zero space.  Case closed.<br />
Hate reduction poison - Evade.  Enough said.  Str and dex debuff poisons.  Very nice!  Very situational, mostly raid potions (provided they stack with the common raid debuffs) unless components are common enough to replace used potions at a decent rate.<br />
Basically, the only poisons I see useful enough to be worth inventory space are the snare line for normal play, and Str/Dex debuff poisons if I'm going on a raid.  This is assuming only one poison buff is allowed at any one time.  I can't imagine them letting us have multiple proc buffs up at once P  <br />
<br />
Proc Buff poisons I would liked to have seen:<br />
Mana drain over time.  450 mana over 60 seconds<br />
Slow poison - 25 to 40 percent slow (lvl 50 to 65) for 180 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Stiffening Ergot - Tier III poison<br />
<br />
50% Slow + 95% Snare  duration 102 seconds<br />
<br />
Give me a tier IV or V upgrade, same effect with an extended duration instead.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't see myself using a proc poison that's considerably worse than one I can make with minimal effort already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karadin</div><div class="date">10-22-02, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Old poisons, and the more recent pre-PoP poison update systems were not &quot;broken&quot;.  Just because something is &quot;crap&quot; (say a Short Sword of Ykesha) to you doesn't mean its broken.  Take any poison recipe's components, combine them in a mortar and pestle, and they create poisons.  Apply said poison to your blade, it will go off.  Thus, it's not a &quot;bug fix&quot; for a &quot;broken&quot; bit of code.  Just because you don't consider it worthwhile doesn't give you license to use improper words or faulty argumentative logic.</div></div><hr />

I think you will have to have PoP to use the new poisons. As it is I have yet to see any of the new stuff poison and vial vendors are supposed to be selling.<br />
