No, sadly this is the single player  Not much new info has come out about .hack//fragment. But I think they planed to release it close to or after this one.<br />
<br />
I look forward to .hack//fragment a lot the on-line concepts and ablility to make your own stuff is pretty neat.</div></div><hr />

I really hope this battle system is better. The old .hack// ones are ok but its nice to have area battles and more one on oneness.</div></div><hr />

Where it is open wide range combat. Ill try and find the review in my game informer on which one it was but it would be nice to see it just like real online play like everquest but with a more better yet inteligent AI.</div></div><hr />

Well from the SS and the demo movie it looks like they box you inside a blue ring thing so your forced to fight within the circle. Altho the actual combat looks a lot better then just spaming your &quot;Do magic now!&quot; and skills buttons.</div></div><hr />
