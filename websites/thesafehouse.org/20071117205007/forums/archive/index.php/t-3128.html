<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">10-27-03, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, here's what I need.  I'm creating an organization for a campaign I volunteer for, which is focused around barbarian/ranger/druids.  I need to populate it with some NPCs, and while I can come up with all the flavor text for them, I haven't got the slightest idea how to build a character much higher than 6th or 7th level, never having played one  <br />
<br />
Here's what I need.  2 level 18 characters, one predominantly barbarian, one predominantly (or totally) druid.  The Barb shouldnt' have more than 3 or 4 levels of fighter, and can take Tribal defender if it helps.  Either can take levels of Bloodhound, Deepwood Sniper,Exotic Weapon Master, Foe Hunter, King/Queen of the Wild, Shifter, Tamer of Beasts, Tempest and, Verdant Lord, but I'd really like them to be as simple as possible.<br />
<br />
These guys need to be pretty badass.  The organization allows player characters to advance through the ranks of the org as they gain in power, but, this being a tribal organization, if you want to advance into someone's spot, you have to defeat them through some sort of combat or another.  These 2 guys are the military and druidic leaders of the group, and the battle is to the death, no hope for resurrection.  When a PC fights this battle, he's retired one way or the other.  He dies, and goes *pfft*, or he wins, and becomes the NPC leader for the next up-and-coming PC to beat.  Consequently, I want these guys to be total @#%$ in combat so that it's a real special thing to beat one of them.<br />
<br />
I could also use one or two 12ish level characters that follow the same templates, but these guys aren't the duel-to the death type, they're going to be more the type of NPC that PCs interact with, so just need to be convincing character builds, not particularly tough.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Give him the Thick Skin, Thick Skull, Improved Damage Resistance feats and he'll end up with somewhere around 5 or 6 points of damage reduction naturally.<br />
Little badger would get in and let the claws and fangs fly.  Take right right feat from the barb book and youll get both claws and a bite each attack.<br />
Not to mention if he's already strong coming back as badgers adds another 6 to your strength or something like that.  If you drop the points from stat gains into strength you could end up with a little critter with 30 strength, Sure its claws only do 1d6 as compared to that magic great axe but he adds another 10 to it because of strength and has a second one for free.  Send him berserk and do 1d6+12, 1d6+12 and 1d4+12 in each of his 4 attacks. Possiblility of 208 damage in one round, without criticals.<br />

Another fun option for the barbarian is the Forsaker class - 6 hp/round regen, spell resistance, natural weapon attacks, and improved armor class.  Throw in the sunder+power attack feats and have him love to divest opponents of their magical gear and armor throughout the course of the fight.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver<br />

I don't have anything for you Llabak, I don't know the feats. If it were second ed., I'd just tell you to throw in some home made spell abilities to make your NPCs bad ass, but people seem to resent stuff like that in 3rd ed., probably because it's not something their characters can buy out of a book and use too.   &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls.

Its all about tactics sir. You come up with a character as completely bad-ass as possible, then ya make him even worse by trying to THINK like that character. Ain't to hard, really, just gotta go with the thought that the character will do whatever is in his or her power to stay alive at all costs. 'Cuz I'm Psycho Like That...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you specifically design a character that is going to utterly annihilate everything in its path, you might as well just ad-lib the fight and base the outcome on how the player handles it.<br />
<br />
I never got around to making a 6 custom character Baldur's Gate game of 6 human warriors dual classed to one thief, one cleric, and 4 mages. The idea would be to max out levels, get all the good loot and spells, then actually kill every npc that didn't respawn in the entire game.<br />

When you do something that absurd, you can do anything. And when you decide to think like a character, begin with their early life, not just &quot;I was born a lvl18 character with godly powers, what would I do.&quot; Sensei Pren{Dragon Army}[Tribunal Server]<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe you guys are missing my point, though providing lots of fun suggestions.<br />
<br />
Basicly, I don't know how to create an 18th level character.  I don't know what feats they would have taken, I don't know what classes they would have taken, that kind of thing.  I want these guys to be a tough challenge to an 18th level character and even still somewhat difficult to a 20th level character.  The problem is that if I designed a level 18 character, the feats and skills I'd give him would most likely be sneered at by any player who got their character to level 18 over time, and could plan things out.  <br />
<br />
These guys' stats are public knowledge, and I have to write them up with the character backstory.  I just don't know what to do with them that I thought someone with high level 3e knowledge might do better.  Given the discussions we've had about making up character builds, I thought I could get a hand with that.<br />
<br />
And no, no badgers LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awww, but they are cute.  And fuzzy.  And have Sharp Pointy Teeth. &amp;lt;rar&gt; :LOL<br />
<br />
Well if you want them to develop that way the easiest thing to do would be come up with a 'chapter' of their backstory and make a character at 4th level.  Then come up with another 'chapter' and raise them to 8th.  Continue on this way each time evaluating if the person could work as an adventurer.  Eventually you get an 18th level person that fits well with the background and is a plausable character.<br />
<br />
Some of the prestiege classes are nice but they tend to be really specalized and some actually seem to draw away from a basic characters abilities.<br />
If you take a PClass at all then it has to fit in with the campaign.<br />
<br />
If your worried about picking feats that fit then just think about it this way.  Is there some theme you want to go for?  Great Cleave for example.  Find out what level you would have to be to get that and all its requirements.  Make the character that level fully.  Now think again, what would his next goal be based upon his background.  Get him to the level that he needs to accomplish that.<br />
Just because they are the tribal leader because of their combat prowess dosnt mean that the only thing they can do is fight.  (Unless thats how the tribe works, typically dont dont ammount to much though)  Maybe he's a really good tracker as well.  Throw in Tracking and Skill Focus (Wilderness Surival)  Now youve got a barb that can chase down that bear after it runs away from the wrestling match.<br />
<br />
Characters above 10 levels are powerful in their own right.  With 3ed its just a matter of how you want to divide that power up.  You start getting feats like Improved Critical available to you.  Things that should be be overlooked IMHO.  Give him a Scimitar and Imp. Crit and you have one nasty barb.  Throw in a Power Attack that he uses at the full 5 all the time and you have some serious wounding coming.  This is even just a normal barb too.<br />
If you look in the barb book you can find a few intresting variations of Rage.  Though I cant see a leader being a battlerager unless its a primitive tribe of cavemen.  The leader is responsible for the life of the tribe, its hard to think about that when your foaming at the mouth.</div></div><hr />

I don't see much fairness in a single powerful monster, and even a couple lackeys, versus a rounded party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arafain</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">omg, Nenjin, are you serious?<br />
<br />
Okay, picture your typical dragon versus adventuring party.   Dragon strikes first, winning a surprise round. One breath of superheated steam to start things off, and all the non-rogues have taken some pretty serious damage.  Next round, dragon moves in - boom, claw-claw-bite-wing-wing, chances are a party member just died.  Now the dragon retreats and flies high up into the air, casting a healing spell on itself to replenish any damage it took.  Circling over the party once, it delivers a flyby attack on the most wounded person it sees, then comes around one more time and breathes again.  <br />
<br />
At this point, chances are at least 2-3 party members are dead or down, and those remaining are either low on hit points or considering their chances against said dragon alone.  As if that wasn't enough, this is a sea dragon - which has a swim speed and can fight underwater, and it uses its Control Water ability to fill the room with water.  Remaining party members are now drowning, failing their swim checks, moving half speed at best, and taking penalties on their attacks AND their damage, and worst of all having a visibility of five feet, whereas the dragon is using blindsight (and thus can see perfectly for 300 feet) and is making swim-by attacks on relatively helpless PCs.  And this is using an environmental variable as simple as H2O, the most common of resources on the planet.<br />
<br />
How about a Xorn's burrowing ability to make attacks through solid rock?   Formidable, sure.  But a Xorn with levels of assassin?  Suddenly, the party's cleric falls over dead, but no one can see what happened.  What do you do?<br />
<br />
A simple sixth-level thief and his gang get targeted by the PCs for a purge.  But what are the PCs going to do when the thief reveals that he carries a stone on him that renders all magic inoperative within thirty feet of him in every direction - and the thief has an intelligence of 18, with a booby-trapped lair and six layers of contingency plans.  Sure, the PCs vastly overpower him in resources - but a rogue with maxed tumble at that level is never going to get hit in melee unless they can catch him, and with no magic in a 30' radius only a high-level monk even has a chance to get close - and the monk is then within range of the thief's bolas, poisoned caltrops, blinding powder, and tanglefoot bag, all of which are totally nonmagical.<br />
<br />
Or a ghost with the Sunder feat who hated magic items and lives to destroy them right off their owner's bodies?<br />
<br />
A trio of bad guys who can body-swap in midfight, as per the Keeper ability?  Run up on the wizard, suddenly he's the warrior, kicking your ass - and they all look identical.<br />
<br />
A battle with six grimlocks in a room where no light can shine.<br />
<br />
A talented assassin targets the PCs, cleric first - and wears a ring of misdirection so that any divination spell cast on him rebounds upon the caster.  The assassin carries scrolls of Trap the Soul with him to prevent resurrection of the fallen cleric, then starts culling the herd.<br />
<br />
A group gets teleported away from their magic-users, who are then slapped with dimensional anchor and beset by magic-immune golems.<br />
<br />
These are all examples of seriously dire challenges, all that use plain, ordinary spells and abilities from the player's handbook and monster manual.  Basic cleverness can account for a lot, and the element of surprise can account for even more.   Giving an NPC a unique special ability is nice on occasion, but the more often you do it, the more you give the impression that you just want your NPCs to be more powerful than the PCs.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if you feel the PCs are too powerful as a well rounded group, maybe you should try to exploit that - split them up, charm them, or make them face other adventuring groups that work just as well together.  Make them face intelligent opponents that target their healers and magic-users first, preferably with one-shot-kill attacks.<br />
<br />
The hierophant with a level of sorcerer who wears boots of speed, hasting himself and casting quickened True Strike and ranged Harm, followed by magic missile.  <br />
<br />
The Dragon-riding wizard who follows a burst of his dragon's breath weapon with Power Word, Kill, taking advantage of depleted hit points to allow no saving throw.<br />
<br />
The lich who puts a Gate into the doorway to his throne room, which actually leads onto the Negative Energy Plane, where mortals accrue negative levels simply for existing every round.<br />
<br />
The rogue who wields a +1 flaming frost screaming shock corrosive shortsword and deals 5d6 damage of sneak attack in addition to the 6d6 from his weapon, and uses his ring of Change Self to pretend to be the party member he just decapitated, claiming it was a doppleganger.<br />
<br />
The fire giant who coup de grace's victims of his cleric wife's Hold Person spells.<br />
<br />
The drow fighter whose cloak surrounds him in a continual fog cloud of Id Moss Mist and Insanity Mist, reducing int and wis by 1d6 each the first round and 2d6 each a minute later, while the fighter himself is completely immune due to his periapt of proof against poison, while the fighter attacks away with poisoned swords that reduce his opponent's CON scores.<br />
<br />
Ghosts that cause any human within 60 feet to suffer 1d6 points of permanent STR, DEX, and CON drain, and then blink out of existence while their shadow hound pets attack the weakened party.<br />
<br />
The permanently hasted high-level monk that uses his fistwraps of energy drain to bestow 5d4 negative levels per round, using only touch attacks - and has Spring Attack so that he's never within the attack range of anyone he fights.<br />
<br />
The psion who feigns death then continues to use his componentless, wordless, gestureless powers while motionless on the floor.<br />
<br />
There are dozens of ways to provide interesting encounters with basic material.  Just be creative.<br />

There are some awesome monster type NPC's you can build from there.  A Minotaur Barbarian is a great combo, a Satyr Druid is good also.  One of the best ones I thought up, and have played since he was 8th lvl (now 20th) is  a Half Brass Dragon Thri-Kreen Ranger/Tempest.  He will have great stat bonuses ( +10 STR,  +6 DEX), natural AC, and 4 arms; when combined with all the other Ranger/Tempest atks, he will make a very formidable opponent.

I think you misunderstood.  Most of those were NPCs my party had to face and defeat in the last campaign I played in.  Except for the level-draining monk.  That was my character.<br />
<br />
The ghost with the ability drain, for example, is a default ghost with the horrific visage ability, which is one of the 6 default ghost powers, 1d3 of which come standard with any ghost.<br />
<br />
They were all examples of what kinds of tough challenges you can face without making up completely new powers and spells.  <br />
<br />
Yes, admittedly, they're all extremely deadly and challenging.  But Nenjin seemed of the opinion that anything that didn't have some sort of custom power would be easy meat for a balanced, well-rounded party - so I was giving him examples of stock-created extreme challenges.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver<br />

<br />
<br />
I threw a modified Greater Wolfwere at my party, which would regenerate 1/2 of the damage he took at the end of every round. Had a -1 AC, 70 hp, 3 attacks at 1d8+3, reduced damge and thac0 when he hit, Thac0 of 12, MR of 60%, and my party killed him in ~4 rounds. First they blinded him, entangled him, then beat the ever loving snot out of him. And that was after resisting crap like Lance of Disruption, 25 points of damage from magic missles, and other stuff. He nailed a PC for a crit, totaling 35 points of damage, and he was promptly healed by the cleric to safety next round. <br />
<br />
MR and ridiculous AC will only get you so far with players in 2nd. ed. Sometimes a monster doesn't need to be hard to kill, as it needs to kill hard, to make an impression on players. I like that philosophy. Players can triumph all they want, but there could be price payed. And when PCs die in the attempt to achieve something, or a big battle, it can mitigate that bitterness they feel when they get trounced. <br />
<br />
Lots of creatures are easy meat for a balanced, upper level party. The ones that aren't are context sensitive. I don't use dragons unless dragons should be there, Xorn's are rare as can be. Depending on where the party is, a custom creature may need to be taylored. If they are in the goblin jungle, name me a kind of goblin that, even in large numbers, could threaten a 8th lvl party. So I make a new goblin, goblin fanatics, or goblin spider riders, to make an assumed easy encounter more difficult.<br />
<br />
A lot of your examples are 3rd ed. stuff that I don't play under, and others are well, exactly what I'm talking about, DM perogative in creating difficult encounters. Stock abilities can be modified to appear new, when they really aren't. <br />
<br />
That's how I like to keep my players guessing, especially the experienced ones, who've made a night of reading the Monsterous Manuals. It took them an entire fight to figure out that these giant, undead dire wolves weren't anything stock from the book, because they took reduced damage from weapons, and kept overpowering people to the ground. In contrast, when they fought a ghost, the first thing the monk did was go into the ethereal, because he KNEW the ghost was more vunerable, in fact ridiculously vunerable.</div></div><hr />

First they blinded him, entangled him, then beat the ever loving snot out of him. And that was after resisting crap like Lance of Disruption, 25 points of damage from magic missles, and other stuff. He nailed a PC for a crit, totaling 35 points of damage, and he was promptly healed by the cleric to safety next round. My level sixteen party killed a CR 24 monster called a Lochrock in less than a round with Harm and Magic Missile.  What's your point?  We were also quite soundly defeated by a CR 19 dragon....five minutes before the fight with the Lochrock.  <br />

Quote:If they are in the goblin jungle, name me a kind of goblin that, even in large numbers, could threaten a 8th lvl party. So I make a new goblin, goblin fanatics, or goblin spider riders, to make an assumed easy encounter more difficult.Honestly, there should be no goblin that threatens an 8th level party.  If your adventurers are in an area populated only by goblins that give them no exp, they should only encounter goblins that give them no exp.  Similarly, if they are in an area full of creatures much too powerful for them, they should encounter monsters much too powerful for them - this kind of world design promotes a consistent geography and monster ecology.<br />
<br />
Also, I think you're right about the 2nd/3rd edition gap between our ideas - but to use an example from the 3rd edition DMG, the difference between a fight with six ogres and a fight with six ogres and a cleric with Improved Invisibility and Silent Spell is very great indeed.  <br />
<br />
Another thing about players that read the Monster Manual alot is that you don't have to change monsters' powers to provide a surprise - simply play switch.  If you have a three-foot-tall blue creature that looks vaguely like a frog with tusks, who's to know that the creature has identical statistics to a troll?<br />
<br />
Also, you can't really get mad about the monk and the ghost.  Honestly, that's just a really good indication of a power being perfectly suited to a situation.  That's like being angry that your troll died to a fighter with a flaming sword.  Or your vampire was totally owned by that cleric with the holy symbol and a 16 charisma.

Why? Is there some law about gaming where goblins cannot kick ass? That's the beauty of DM perogative. I don't have to limit my ideas to what the books outline. And players that are book-jockeys get to be surprised, because I don't always follow the books.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Goblins are horde fighters, there should be a goblin ARMY that can threaten 8th level adventurers.<br />
<br />
Add in a several 4th level clerics, and one 6th level goblin fighter with an oddly advanced intelligence and a good grasp of guerrilla tactics, and you have a very very very very mean situation coming in.<br />
<br />
Either that, or the goblins in the jungle just so happen to include a small but well disciplined group of Hobgoblins, and while the adventurers are chasing after a couple of the little squeaky green ones, a whole bunch of nasty looking yellow ones just jumped out from behind that fern and are chewing on yer mage's head!<br />
<br />
Hell, its a jungle, the goblins have been there longer than you, and one of them gobbies just happens to be a rogue that's particularly good at using the local flora and fauna to make a rather large number of amusing booby traps... just WAITING to be stumbled upon...<br />
<br />
And god forbid they should simply sit up in the trees and rain a hail of stones, arrows, fruits, and pissed off Mandrills upon the interloping adventurers... ook OOK dammit. 'Cuz I'm Psycho Like That...</div></div><hr />

I keep seeing images of a raiding party of kobolds swimming up to the ship on logs and starting to quietly dig away at the sides of it at the waterline.  When they are attacked they go underwater and wait for people to loose attention, then start again.</div></div><hr />

Not at ALL true.<br />
<br />
I ran my group into a Goblin that wiped the floor with them.<br />
<br />
Take a basic goblin, add 10 levels of barbarian, 8 levels of cleric, 2 levels of Tribal defender, and a paragon template...<br />
<br />
Wave bye bye to the party.<br />
<br />
The goblin was basically the tribal leader. A shaman sort of 'messenger of the spirits&quot;. Edited by: Kanaellars at: 11/2/03 10:16 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vorashus</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree. <br />
<br />
your party should never be able to say, &quot;oh, its just a goblin. no worries&quot;<br />
<br />
i mean, really, think of it. thats the same as saying &quot;oh... its just a human&quot;. same thing basically, only a little taller.<br />
<br />
i have to side with Nenjin whole-heartedly on this one. as a DM theres nothing wrong with fudging the rules to make a more entertaining encounter, for both your players and yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordOfChains</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pray tell, what level were the characters that fought that monstrosity?<br />
<br />
I stand by my statement. Goblins are supposed to be the universal cannon fodder of the D&amp;amp;D realm. If ya wanna get yer players to actually learn something, you need to throw tactics at 'em, not just one single hyper-uber-mega-super-jumbo-ultra-deluxe buffed goblin that clears entire forests with but a single jaw-dropping fart.<br />
<br />
That's not to say that a single paragon goblin could amass a pretty devastating army of goblinkin and start a ravaging plague of the little green, blue, red, yellow, and purple blighters that would devastate the general campaign countryside. (kinda like the thousand orcs thing, but even MORE surreal)<br />
<br />
Besides, I would have just skipped over the hyper-leveled paragon gobbie and gone straight to the party knocking heads with a goblin GOD. What were you THINKING man?! You were letting them off easy!<br />
<br />
And that's the good thing about RPG's... doesn't matter what my opinion is, you'll still play the way you want, and I'll still play the way I want.<br />
<br />
(psst, Paragon Hobgoblin ftr10 / rgr5 / tempest5 / Sor5 / Mindbender10... just keep that in mind yo.) 'Cuz I'm Psycho Like That...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if you can say that about humans....you can say it about Goblins too. Granted, I don't throw out Goblins that are the match of a 7th level party all the time.....but I do regularly create variants on monster types. Lava gobins, arctic werewolves, Swamp Trolls........it keeps my game more fun, for me, and more challenging, and fun, for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kanaellars</div><div class="date">11-01-03, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The party consisted of 5 11-14th level characters.<br />
<br />
Ftr, Clr, Rog, Pal, Wiz I think it was.<br />
<br />
The Paragon Goblin had 2 champions who were bar10/clr4 and the remainder of his horde of goblins and goblinkin were between 2nd and 6th level, with a mix of mostly barbs and clerics...<br />
<br />
It was an intresting game.<br />
<br />
The basic premise was that this goblin 'blessed by his god' had gathered and organised the most devistating goblin horde in recordeed history. They were rampaging through human lands looting and killing. The party was asked to stop them by stopping thier leader. Edited by: Kanaellars at: 11/2/03 10:16 am</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kanaellars</div><div class="date">11-01-03, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea was for them to find this guy, realise they could not beat him, and then go to find some other way to stop him.<br />
<br />
They ended up sneaking into his camp, trying to kill him in his sleep, and getting forcibly thrown through the planes.<br />
<br />
Enter Planescape. The travelled to a few different worlds seeking powerful items and growing in personal power, then returned almost a year later (in real time...) as a group of 19-20 almost epic characters to free their people, who had been enslaved by these super-goblins.<br />
<br />
Dueling this monstrosity of a goblin one-on-one ended up being the event that gave the level 20 paladin what he needed to become an epic hero. (and even at 20 he would not have won if not for the fact that he had basically and artifact holy sword given to him directly from the hand of his god, a shield artifact from his gods first paladin, armor that was an artifact from another realm of existance, and a number of other VERY powerful magical items.)<br />
<br />
NOTE on that: I don't run epic as 'you get x XP, you ding 21'. To become an epic character (level 21) the character must complete some VERY special task. In this case the group was about to be slaughtered by a horde of beasts and the Paladin challenged the goblin leader to a man to man combat for final victory. The paladin became the first memeber of the group to hit 21 although 4 memebers of the group technically had MORE than enough XP saves up for it.<br />
<br />
PS. Back on the original subject... give me a few hours tonight and I will try to have those NPCs drawn up for you.<br />
<br />
I make my NPCs using basic PC rules, rolling 4d6, drop lowest, re-roll ones. I give major NPC's 2d4 worth of additional stat points, that can be attributed to the fact that even NPCs can find magical books. Minor NPCs get 1d4 additional points. For HP I give them max for first level, and then 'high average' from there out. I will make a couple variations of each one so you have some flexibility, and I will provide them to you both equipped and unequipped so you can pick and choose if you do not like what items I give them.<br />
<br />
Would you prefer they be human or non-human? Send me mail to let me know. Edited by: Kanaellars at: 11/2/03 10:16 am</div></div><hr />
