<br />
The recipe book-  A well worn and travel stained volume it represents many hours of adventure and experiment in the course of learning one of the primary arts of the assassin.  Without the lore contained within no poisons can be produced.<br />
<br />
The book should replace the spell book that a magi carries with the recipes being scribed like spells.  These no drop recipes should be obtained via questing.  These quests should replace the time sink of farming endless greens.  I'd like the quests to have a roguish slant and be doable by the rogue himself or a duo.<br />
<br />
The Poison kit-  A special 8 slot container that is capable of holding other containers but limited to holding 2 special containers only.<br />
<br />
The vials-  Far and away from the disposable bottles we use now each one is the work of a master craftsman and will be reused indefinately for the type of poison it is intended for.  Combine the finished poison from your morter and pestle with the empty vial to produce a 1 - 3 (constant depending on type) charge filled vial.<br />
<br />
The ingredients-  <br />
-Simple ingredients will be 100% store bought<br />
-Hard ingredients will follow a new format.  Simply you will use a certain number of the ingredients to produce a distilation of whatever which is an item with a large number of charges of summon dose of whatever<br />
<br />
Ex. 6 shissar venom sacs = 1 jar of shissar venom, 6 jars of venom = Distillation of Shissar Venom effect: summon dose of shissar venom charges:100.<br />
<br />
The Morter and Pestle- Same as always.<br />
<br />
The Poison bag. A container than can hold many tiny items.  All reagents and distilations should be classed as tiny.  All poison vials should be classed as small.  Poison vials shouldn't go in any other normal slot.<br />
<br />
Management of the poison kit would be as follows.<br />
The first slot would be taken up by the mortar.  The second by the bag.  That leaves 6 slots in which to place poisons.<br />
<br />
Creation of poisons should require a longer time say 3 minutes  per poison, application however should be almost instant with the limitation that you can only do it every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Types of poisons.<br />
<br />
Long/stable poisons.  These would add a proc to your weapon for 40 minutes however no single effect would be devestating.<br />
<br />
Short/volatile poisons.  These would be extremely nasty, more expensive and more likely to require a distillation or a more difficult to obtain one.  They would always proc on the first melee hit with a decreasing chance to proc with each successive hit with the effect till its gone within a few seconds.  that you would get between 1-5 procs within seconds. Each proc that landed would increase the nastiness of the effect.  Ex 1 proc leads to a 10 a tick dot 5 to a 50 a tick dot.  If not stuck to something within 10 minutes of being applied they will fade.<br />
<br />
Poisoned arrows/daggers.  Produced by putting a stack of said items into your mortar and combining with a vial of stable poison.  Some poisons will not combine in this manner and some will have decreased potency when used in this manner.<br />
<br />
Poison Effects- It seems to me that the idea of poisons which either cause no damage besides the ill effects they cause and those that cause all their damage at once are poor stylisticly.<br />
<br />
Even if some poisons were made to do their damage within seconds and the dot component added to debuff poisons were small enough to be less than signifigant it would seem to me to be much more satistying.<br />
<br />
Other than that verant has allready provided a good selection of effects.  The only things I'd like to see is one that causes short duration drunkeness + short flashes of blindness and slow (only on volatiles not on stable) replaced with one that debuffed str and caused the players miss ratio to increase (not via the str debuff but via curse like code)</div></div><hr />
