Oh hellllll yes. Kanon is the only anime series that ever made me cry, and I absolutely adore it. It was so sweet, and the character development was quite good.. I dunno, I'm very excited about a remake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plot Summary: At first, Takayuki Narumi is befriended by Mitsuki Hayase only because Mitsuki's best friend, Haruka Suzumiya has a crush on him; however since then, Takayuki, his pal Shinji Taira, and Mitsuki have grown to be the best of friends. Then one day, Haruka confesses to Takayuki her love for him. Not wanting to hurt her feelings, Takayuki agrees to go out with her. After a few incidents, their relationship gets intimate, even while Takayuki and Mitsuki begin to realize their feelings for each other. But suddenly, when tragedy strikes, things are never the same for these four friends again. <br />
<br />
What made it good for me is how they dealt with the tragedy really. Its just very sad...was prob the first anime to really make me cry :(.<br />
<br />
Its 14 Eps long.<br />
<br />
Lots of guys admit to crying to this one.<br />
<br />
&lt;3 the last eps song...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
He looks and sounds WAY too much like Kyon. Not to mention I really dislike a.f.k's translating this time around. Listing names american-style, not typing out the Uguu~, things like that. What release is everyone else watching? I need to switch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also Akiko's (Yuuichi's aunt's) voice sounds familiar, but I looked up the voice actor on ANN encyclopedia and didn't recognize any of the roles.  I just can't recall who she reminds me of.</div></div><hr />

They translate the uguu~ and auuu~ etc.<br />
<br />
The translations are ok. And yeah, Yuuichi does sound a lot like Kyon. KyoAni is very well known for it's self-parodying. Yuuichi was kind of a **** in the game, but not so much in the way he is in the anime, but I don't really mind. I liked Kyon a lot.</div></div><hr />

Well, yeah because it is the same voice actor. Omokazu Sugita (Rin from Shuffle! and Kyon from Haruhi)<br />
Kawasumi Ayako (Fuu from Samurai Champloo, Saber from F/SN, Yoshida Kazumi from Shana and so on)<br />
Tamura Yukari (Yoshida Sakura from Da Capo, Takamachi Nanoha from Nanoha)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">12-03-06, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the pacing is a bit too quick when it reveals what's wrong. should have had her get more sick, with hints dropped by amano, untill they came out and said it/yuuichi figures it out. Should have also had more interaction with the other gilrs during this time. Making it 'makoto arc' just doesn't gibe the same suprise that it would have if it kinda came outta nowhere, after she had been getting sicker for awhile.<br />
 <br />
Still, Makoto is even more adorable this time around, so it's OK. Let's hope Mai's character improves, thought her story was the weakest in the original.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darcean</div><div class="date">12-03-06, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, i agree with you, they should have developed the other stories a little more, because now, they've gotten me attached to makoto and yuuichi, no one else, thats the only story they've really only touched on so far, deeply touched on i mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">12-03-06, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">KyoAni doesn't really have a choice in that regard. You'd have to play the game to see why, but think of it as such - everyone's path spreads out after the initial period and the bad/good stuff happens at an relatively same amount of time, so you'd end up with 16 episodes of meaninglessness (not that it's a bad thing, to me at least... I did like Ichigo Mashimaro!) then end up with 8 episode crammed with everything.<br />
<br />
In that sense, I am grateful it's being done in arcs. It gives the organization the game had, at a small (in my opnion) compromise. But simulatously it gives all the girls a fair chance to shine (i.e. Mai, who really got screwed over).</div></div><hr />

since i've never seen the original, nor have i played the game, i would have to say, they executed this episode damn well, + the sadness factor =( auuuuu~! <br />
<br />

the scene at the end.. is makoto gonna make a comeback later in the series or was that just Yuuichi's imagination on what he would wish for?</div></div><hr />

Ahh, I like the way Mai's story is going. I think I can see how they are going to actually resolve it, instead of the 1st series:<br />
 <br />
Ya know, mai freaking out, making the whole thing up 'cause she's dillusional about losing her best friend from when she was little. Looks like there really are 'demons' this time, prolly brought into existance by Mai's psychosis again, but at least it isn't her breaking everything because she's Hallucinating. We've seen instances of things breaking without Mai at fault.<br />
 <br />
Of course, I could totally be proven wrong.</div></div><hr />

this episode just, wow'd me, from mai's backstory to the fight between the &quot;demons&quot; to the end with mai stabbing herself to yuuichi, this episode was just a wow fest. 200000/10 :D</div></div><hr />

Well, I felt it kinda got rushed a bit. It felt like the last 4 eps with Mai have been filler, with this one being half filler then cramming a few ep's worth in under 10 minutes (second half of the show).<br />
<br />
Regardless, it was a good episode.</div></div><hr />

Found it odd they downplayed one of the most soul-crushing moments of the first series. Tho, thinking about it, having her poof like Makoto is more in-line with the 'darker' mood of the current series.</div></div><hr />

That being said, 21:<br />
<br />
Looks like we're getting Nayuki's arc, a pleasant suprise. I guess they'll be able to do everyone then. It makes sense for Ayu to disappear before they do Nayuki since it involves her being alone with Yuuichi, but for a split second I did think they were skipping her arc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok I know it was not meant to be funny, but I already knew what was gonna happen to Akiko from the game. So the impact was lessened significantly for me. What I found remarkable was that it looked more like a disappearing act. I'm pretty sure all that really happened was Akiko did a flash step and twisted her ankle, but was never hit by the car.</div></div><hr />
