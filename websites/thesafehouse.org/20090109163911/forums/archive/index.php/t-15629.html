<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm not really sure where I should be going or what I should be doing. The worst thing for me is the decisions that ya don't get much info on. I very much feel like I'm making completely uninformed decisions when it comes to my character - I don't mean quests or hunting grounds so much as say classes and tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfocused?  I don't really follow.  It seems as focused as any MMORPG I've played.  Are you sure you aren't confusing lack of focus with am abundance of things to do?  It seems I always have a quest to finish, a new area to explore, a tradeskill to work on, or a new level to earn.  The primary foci are the same as they've always been in EQ, to level up and get better stuff.<br />
<br />
As for information about classes and tradeskills, it takes a while for that sort of thing to become common knowledge.  Every game I've ever started at launch has been like that (Camelot comes to mind in a big way).  I think the basics behind each class and subclass are pretty well explained, but the details will only be revealed in time.  For now, the important decisions (basic class, subclass, class) and starting city are the only major class decisions.  Hell, in Camelot the manual outright lied and said that hunters could track and berserkers could shapechange (they couldn't at release).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I'm sure there are going to be roadbumps too (troubadors are better than dirges, alchemy is easier and makes more money than woodcrafting, etc etc) but that's part of what you get when you play a game from the beginning.  Hopefully SoE did a good job balancing the classes and tradeskills in beta, because I'd rather not repeat my Camelot experience (started as a shaman and they completely SUCKED at launch and for a good year afterward).</div></div><hr />

Man, I laughed out loud when I read this ...  :lol<br />
<br />
oh, no offense ...  :)  Just struck me as funny.  Because when I first read the first post I thought that was what was meant ... and the second post I was like hmm ...  by the third post I was like yeah thats what I was thinking ... and then the final clarification ... /chuckle</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried playing with the graphical options?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh I thought the same thing Peebs did when I read the original post.<br />
<br />
As to the blur thing, you probably have some of the 'bloom' effects turned on in the graphics options...</div></div><hr />

Haha, me too.  Seriously funny stuff, especially when you consider the fact that the &quot;deeper&quot; meaning does seem to have a little merit.<br />

The graphics seem very clear to me, no fuzzyness noticed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scamp</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Until just yesterday I only had 512mb of ram, so I had my graphics pretty low to minimize the effects of the memory leaks. I upgraded to 1gb and turned my graphics up. I have to agree, everything is very blurry. The character models are blurry, the water is blurry, some of the textures are blurry. But to credit the graphics, the lighting is absolutely beautiful. I had played with all lighting off before. When I turned it on, the textures looked beautiful. The character models looked horrible, so I turned those back down. It was honestly giving me a headache.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sillis</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are running an LCD display, try setting the resolution to one of the supported resolutions, meaning usually LCDs (at least older ones) have two settings they display properly, a native and a stretch.<br />
<br />
On my LCD, I had a game or two set to a weird resolution and it was blurry.  I changed vid cards, still blurry.  Then I went Duh (meaning I remembered what I had read about the resolution in the manual), changed the resolution and it was nice and sharp.<br />
<br />
Worth a look at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are honestly getting headaches while playing, it is probably due to the default 60mhz refresh rate.  Jack it up to 85 if you can, and headaches go away.<br />
