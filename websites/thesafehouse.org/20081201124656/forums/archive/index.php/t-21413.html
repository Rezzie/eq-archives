As you can imagine, the fans are already hard at work on deciphering it.</div></div><hr />

I actually took linguistics, as a GE course. I'll take a stab at in a bit.<br />

     I completed the journey a week ago, but, as you have asked of me, I have not written to you until I have found something of worth.<br />
<br />
     I know that you have long thought on a language that is older than any that we have seen prior to the Cataclysm, and I believe I have found it for you. Six scrolls, held bound in ancient leather and bronze, had thin sheets of hammered brass in between the leaves. The lettering upon them was faded red and limned in places with gold ink that flaked off before our eyes. The scrolls were recovered from the lake near Tursh here in the west.<br />
<br />
     I had the copyist reproduce the fragments so we can both begin our study. I am sending you the originals as I write this. I look forward to your letter with your thoughts on translation.<br />
<br />
     Your faithful son</div></div><hr />

I'll try to be there for the next go 'round.</div></div><hr />
