Guild Demise- Who are we looking for?<br />
<br />
First and foremost Demise is looking for people who wake up, put in a good days work, take care of their families and their house, and want to spend a few hours a night logging on and having fun with friends, yet driven enough to give the top guilds a run for their money. We want responsible people who conduct themselves accordingly. We want people who have the competitive drive to get more done in less time. We want people who get along well with others and can follow direction. But most of all, we want people who HAVE FUN. If your not having fun, there is no point in logging in!<br />
<br />
Currently recruiting 5/4/06</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velyth</div><div class="date">05-07-06, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Demise guild, a Vanguard raiding guild, will be recruiting members for the new Everquest Combine progression server to be opened next month. This guild will transition from Everquest, to Vanguard upon release of the game. Let me add..........We will NOT be racing for server firsts, or the first guild to open expansions, however, we will not spend 2 weeks feeling all warm and fuzzy and working on level 5 armour quests either. We will move along at a nice steady clip and enjoy our last venture upon the grounds of Norrath. Requirements will be the same as for Vanguard. Check out the site(under construction, but useable), for details.<br />
<br />
Details on the new server can be found here:<br />
