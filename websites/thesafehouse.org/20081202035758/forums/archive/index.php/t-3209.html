<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tweil</div><div class="date">06-27-02, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have completed every quest in ACT 1 except for the last tomb.  It is the one with all the swords (don't even have enough time to count them all).  My character is a (4)Barbaian, (2)Rogue, (1) Ranger and has roughly 90 hitpoints.  I usually duel wield (the 1 ranger level   ) so my ac is around 17-18 (light armor to help with the attack bonus off two weapon fighting).  I tried about 10 times with my rogue henchmen and get thurougly routed.  I think one time I killed two swords before I was out of potions.<br />
<br />
I know have the cleric henchmen, but I do not know if she will be enough to help me win the fight.  Any tips or advice?<br />
<br />
Also, another question...is there any way to tell when your henchmen is out of spells?  I would hate to think she was going to heal me only to see her melee.<br />

Only, they never triggered the turn in text when I went back.  So I thought I had missed something else in the room.  I just want to finish the last quest then move on with the last cure part turn in =(<br />

Really a moot point now since I said fudge it and went on with the storyline. The Napping Druid<br />
