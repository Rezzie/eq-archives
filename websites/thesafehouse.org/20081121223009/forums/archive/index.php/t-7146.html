I'd recommend a wizard+necro, or druid+necro, or druid+wizard, or wizard+ench, or druid+ench! etc.  Kitings pretty much the only way to duo in PoP.<br />
<br />
If you're sticking to low levels, IE pre 60, I like Shaman+Necro or Shaman+SK.  Also good is Enchanter+Paladin, or Druid+BL. Vegetable Omniz, <br />

<br />
Enchanter CoD is a great spell. Druid/Ranger just keeps pet snared at all times incase charm breaks. Chanter pet will do more DPS than another other class, plus will be able to survive the large amounts of damage PoP mobs do. Druid can either dot/nuke or heal pet, while a ranger could fire arrows and do good amount of added damage.<br />

Halls of honor zone in / courtyard is easy enough.  Harmony a few mobs, go in, Dire Charm a Wrulon Youngling.<br />
<br />
Buff the pet up ( we have a spell that hastes the pet, and adds other melee stats, etc.)  The pet now is hasted and hits for 149 max.<br />
<br />
Pull from zone in and courtyard.  Black armored guys normally ( Guardian of Marr, An Animated Guardian, A Protector of Marr)<br />
<br />
Snare X2- 3 times.  Lay about 3-5 DoTs if you wish.  Sic your DC pet, 65 Necromancer friend lays on his DoTs and sics his pet as well.  Kite the mob along the back wall in the graveyard to avoid a few pathing issues in the zone.  Run around fast in wolf form, keeping aggro, sit and med between dots, and let the pets kick the mobs ass.  With KEI, and necro mana regen, pulls should be non stop.<br />
<br />
With 100% AA turned on, its about 3% AA xp per kill duo, and can solo just as easily for about 6% AA xp per kill.  No idea on the regular xp one would receive on these mobs. Venerable Wickedneck<br />

<br />
im 65 necro, spouse is 65 mage... we duo almost exclusively, can pull down aa point every 30 to 45 minutes at best, 5 a day (8 hours) at worst if camps are sparse.<br />
<br />
made 450k in 6 weeks while we were both level 57.... <br />
<br />
(not gonna tell you where and how we do the above, or we'll get crowded out of camps) but sufficive to say... the duo rocks.<br />
