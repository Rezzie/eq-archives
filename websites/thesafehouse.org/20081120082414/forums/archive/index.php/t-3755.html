What are Key classes for this fight? How many clerics, enchanters, magic DPS or melee? how much does inny hit for? double? triple? quad? Im seeing if this is a applicable target for the guild I am in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caldiien</div><div class="date">10-12-03, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two groups should easily be able to handle him.  A group of people I used to play with took him out all the time.  Our raid makeup usually looked like this.<br />
<br />
65 Paladin<br />
65 Shadowknight<br />
65 Druid<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
65 Wizard<br />
65 Shaman<br />
65 Mage<br />
65 Cleric (sometimes 2)<br />
65 Rogue (sometimes)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure on his exact stats or damage, me being the enchanter, but I do remember him having not very many hit points whatsoever.  He procs a nasty Gflux/Pillage Enchantment PBAE, that will wipe all buffs from the main tank and any people within melee range in two or three casts at most.  I think you have to be within melee range to cast on him as well, but I could be mistaken.  He is also only partially slowable.  It's best if the clerics and other healers spam quick heals instead of Chealing though, because of how fast Inny hits.  It's also best if you can get him facing one of the corners in the hallway before his room, and have the MT keep aggro on him to keep him facing the corner.  He also rampages, but I don't exactly remember how often.  <br />
<br />
I hope this info helps some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Runesil</div><div class="date">10-12-03, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another chanter here, so not 100% sure on melee stats...but I believe he hits 900ish, dunno if it's triple or quads.  Partially slowable, but must be in melee range to land any spells (except tash/malo).  I'd recommend at least two tanks, one MT and a rampage tank.  Doesn't rampage a lot, but enough that you'll want to land a cripple and have a dedicated healer (druid etc if no extra clerics) for the rampage tank until slowed.  <br />
<br />
As far as I know Inny has the two different procs.  One is an AE grav flux/dispel of one slot (always gets first buff).  The second is a much bigger dispel targeted on MT which will very quickly strip all buffs off them.<br />
<br />
If you setup correctly you can get all your healers hidden behind a wall, but still in healing range of MT.  Best spot we've found is to pull Inny to the corner immediately to the right as you enter his room, and then the clerics can sit out in the hall in the corner and still reach him.  You need to make sure that the rampage tank gets his aggro position, because from this setup the clerics are in rampage range and that can get ugly.<br />

Old one didn't dispell with the AE or hit for 900 though and was fully slowable.</div></div><hr />

I think we're 2-5 on him.  Nice part is that even if you wipe on Inny its an easy fast CR and you can always kill the Broodmother on the way.<br />
<br />
We normally try with 3-4 groups leveled 55-65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All you do is look for the &quot;Luggald High Priest&quot;. He is the trigger mob. He is indifferent and you dont have to kill him. To spawn Inny is easy. If High Priest is up just clear his room. Thats it. There are about 6 mobs in his room after you kill the 4th or 5th one the High Priest will say something about Inny, he will say it not zone wide shout. Few minutes after that Inny will pop in the center of the room.<br />
<br />
Best way to trigger him is to set up in the hall about half way. Pull at least half the room then pull the other half. When you have the second half dead Inny should be up or about to pop. Just make sure you dont agro Inny =).<br />

<br />
Does the high priest have a placeholder?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing no since you don't actually kill him.<br />
<br />
Innoruk was killed on the Rathe on Monday night, so the High Priest should be up on Thursday. I'm just wondering if I should take a group in early to clear PH's to make sure the High Priest spawns on Thursday since we want to try Inny that night.</div></div><hr />
