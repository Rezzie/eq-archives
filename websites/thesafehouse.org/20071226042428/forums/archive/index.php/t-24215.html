Info wanted:<br />
I am working on guides to the fandom, which should end up answering the majority of everyone's questions. If you want to suggest something for me to put in, let me know. --Stalk<br />

Info does NOT need to be overly detailed, a simple 'quickie' guide for the basics, with locations/links to more in-depth info would be fine.</div></div><hr />

Bit Torrent Information:<br />
<br />
	BitTorrent is both the name of a peer-to-peer (P2P) file distribution client application and also the name of the file sharing protocol itself, both of which were created by programmer Bram Cohen. BitTorrent is designed to widely distribute large amounts of data without incurring the corresponding consumption in costly server and bandwidth resources. CacheLogic suggests that BitTorrent traffic accounts for ~35% of all traffic on the Internet, while other sources are skeptical. <br />
<br />
	The original BitTorrent application was written in Python and its source code, as of version 4.0, has been released under the BitTorrent Open Source License (a modified version of the Jabber Open Source License). There are numerous compatible clients, written in a variety of languages and running on a variety of computing platforms.<br />

FAQ: http://www.cccp-project.net/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ<br />
<br />
What is the Combined Community Codec Pack?<br />
<br />
The CCCP is actually more like a filter pack than a codec pack, but filter doesn't begin with C and we wanted a good acronym. (As a matter of fact, the name is also a pun on the Russian name &#1057;&#1086;&#1102;&#1079; &#1057;&#1086;&#1074;&#1077;&#1090;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1093; &#1057;&#1086;&#1094;&#1080;&#1072;&#1083;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090;&#1080;&#1095;&#1077;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1093; &#1056;&#1077;&#1089;&#1087;&#1091;&#1073;&#1083;&#1080;&#1082;, which is transliterated into Latin alphabet as &quot;Soyuz Sovietskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik&quot;, or &quot;United Soviet Socialist Republics&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;&#1057;&#1057;&#1057;&#1056;&quot; or &quot;USSR&quot;. Blame Lenin and the Commies).<br />
<br />
What operating systems are supported?<br />
<br />
Windows 2000, XP, 2003 and (at least to some degree - see the known issues section) Vista are well supported using the standard pack. Windows 95, 98 and ME are only supported using the special 9x version, which isn't updated as often and isn't as well tested. Basically, all Windows versions newer than Windows 95 (with the exceptions NT3 and NT4, which won't work) are decently supported.<br />

Type in the name of what you want in the search and it comes up with info on the series, as well as a list of every group that's subbed episodes for it etc.  And once you know what the subber is called, you can find the episodes pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Of course, you need to know the name of what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />

They where links to sites where you could find unlicensed AND licensed anime. Also some other &quot;bad&quot; things.</div></div><hr />
