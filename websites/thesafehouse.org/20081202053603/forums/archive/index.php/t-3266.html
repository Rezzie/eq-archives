Quote: We have the entire level 1 mapped out and are populating it as we speak - BUT WE NEED HELP!  We need to make sure that we are populating it correctly, and that we have everything in balance etc.  This project has become large, MUCH much larger that we where thinking it would be, however we are still going strong.  We are estimating that 1 level of Undermountan will take you longer than 1 chapter did from Bioware. (Yes, its that big)  As of right now we have a temple with working portal, return stone, and free portal to party leader (much like the portal system in the retail version worked) we also have a few merchants working in the outside area.  We &quot;made up&quot; a small forest area to host the entrance of RoUM with a portal into Undermountain itself.  RoUM is made for a party of level 4+ characters, our server is set to vault characters only therefore you will not be able to bring in your level 15 from single player etc, we are forcing you to remake your character from level 1.   <br />
<br />
We are looking for people to help us test as far as we have right now, and the new area's that we populate as we go.  We have enough in place for hours of playing right now, so don't think your going to log into some half ass world, this is fully working, it is just not complete. <br />
<br />
It seems things are playable on the first level atleast.</div></div><hr />
