  <br />
 The long day of petty thievery, scuffles, and shadow creeping done, you stroll into the tavern and take a seat in the only open spot at the bar.  The bartender, as if reading your mind, slaps a semi-clean glass and a bottle of Kalish in front of you.  Pouring yourself a drink, you take a slow look around.  Immediately you set eyes on the poor chap next to you.  His slumped shoulders and downcast eyes speak a thousand words.  Dirty face, torn clothing, and bloodied cheek, he is the complete personification of defeat.  You notice a single gold coin pinched in one shaky hand and a half full glass in the other. <br />
  <br />
 The barkeep strolls up and stands before the fellow, casually wiping the counter. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;Anything else I can get ya, Silas?&quot; says the barkeep, eyebrow raised scornfully. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;Y-yeah.  Bottle of brandy.  If'n I'm gunna go down, I'm gunna go down feelin' good, Nat,&quot; mutters Silas. <br />
  <br />
 Flushing with anger, Nat plants his hands on the bar and leans close to Silas.  &quot;Silas!  Get some sense in that rockhead o'yers.,&quot; he hisses.  &quot;Yer not about t' change things by gettin' yerself killed!  It's only MONEY!&quot; <br />
  <br />
 Your interest piqued, you slowly drain your glass and pour yourself another. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;T' hell with that, Nat!&quot; exclaims Silas, slapping his hand on the edge of the bar.  Eyes around the room glance at Silas quickly and as quickly, turn away.  Silas notices and becomes more subdued.  &quot;They gots it all, Nat.  ALL of it.  Left me nuttin' but bruises and a single gad-blasted coin.&quot;  Subconsciously, Silas' hand drifts up to his cut cheekbone.  Wincing, Silas curses quietly. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;At least they left yer skin to be bruised, Silas,&quot; whispers Nat, resuming his countertop polishing.  &quot;People been disappearin' round here.  You know why and you know who, Silas.  It's not fer you to be messin' with.&quot; <br />
  <br />
 Abruptly, Silas stands, his barstool nearly topples over.  Silas tosses back the remains of his drink, wipes his chin and turns to go. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;I'm gettin' it back, Nat.  They're gunna pay.&quot; seethes Silas through clenched teeth as he limps out the tavern door. <br />
  <br />
 Nat the barkeep drops his wipe rag to the countertop and shakes his head in disgust.  &quot;Stupid fool,&quot; he mutters as he clears Silas' glass from the bar, &quot;Gunna get himself killed for money. <br />
  <br />
 Nat notices your obvious attention to matters at hand. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;Anything else you need, friend?&quot; asks Nat. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;Yeah.  How 'bout a meat pie aaand...&quot; You slide a silver coin across the countertop.  Smoothly and quietly, you slip a gold coin under the silver. &quot;...some info on what just happened there.&quot; <br />
  <br />
 Nat spots the gold coin and clenches his jaw.  Lifting his eyes from the coin to yours, he says, &quot;I be burnin' at Innoruuk's feet for sendin' another fool to his death.&quot; <br />
  <br />
  Silently, you drain your glass again. <br />
  <br />
 Temptation too great, Nat grabs the coins and slips them into the folds of his apron. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;Two words, friend.  Barking Mice.  Now don't ask no more!,&quot; he whispers.  Louder, &quot;Meat pie!  Comin' up!&quot;  Nat turns and leaves to the kitchen area. <br />
  <br />
 Left in your own silence, you puzzle over Nat's words.  &quot;Barking Mice&quot;?  What does that mean?  You fill your glass with Kalish and ponder those words, Silas' fate, and your own. <br />
  <br />
