<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Qelin Baitingmaster</div><div class="date">06-12-03, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I've been running around in veksar.  I found a green invis indiff npc named &quot;spirit of garodon&quot;(or something to that effect).  He says that his body is trapped in the theater and it's surrounded by 4 wards that keep his soul from entering. (if you look in he theater sure enough there are 4 drawings one on each wall)   The reason this is interesting and caught my eye is that &quot;garodon&quot; is the name of the dragon that led the raid on veksar that destroyed the city.  The spirit doesn't bother to tell you that.  So we are dealing with a dragon caliber quest which usually means something interesting will come of it.  Anyway I couldn't get the spirit to say anything past the initial hail where he tells me that he requires &quot;4 samples&quot;  but he isn't very clear on what they are.  I spent all day all over veksar and saw a lot of nameds but didn't see anything that had the look of a quest item.  Was just wondering if anyone else had or had come upon the key phrase to make this guy talk.  I have a guess that the 4 samples he wants are the 4 pieces of kylong armor that drop, because he mentions the magic of the kylong.  but I haven't been able to get all 4 yet,  was wondering if anyone knew any additional information.

Quote:[Wed Jun 11 17:33:02 2003] Spirit of Garudon says 'Traveler, you must help me.  I have been tortured in this city for generations.  The mark of the Kylong adorns the walls of the theater that houses my remains.  These markings are preventing me from passing into the theater and rejoining with my body so that I may pass on in peace.  If you can reclaim four samples and return them to me, it may be enough to draw power from.  With this power I will pass into the theater and rejoin my body and rest in peace.  You must do this for me, the torture of eternal capture is more than I can bear.'<br />
<br />
The Dragon spirit seeks Dragon Boneshards, leaves no doubt when you identify them, where they drop is pretty obvious from his description. <br />
That should help you enough, I only have one shard so far so this is all I can share for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where can i find those stories / lore about Veksar ?<br />
thanks for answer Q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Qelin Baitingmaster</div><div class="date">06-12-03, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i would assume the dragon boneshards would be the quest item.  I was looking for something like that that looked like a quest item,  I just hadn't seen anything like that drop yet, and no one in zone mentioned it. <br />
<br />
As for the question on lore,  There is a lot of good lore on veksar specifically from the npc standing in front of the pillar trail that leads to veksar, On the iksar more generally the VP quest npc in the windmill in loio  is a good one to talk to,  (doing the whole vp quest nets some great lore on the iksar btw) <br />
<br />
now that I see this item,  I'll agree it's pretty apparent where it drops,  I'll be hanging out there thanks for the info.  Edited by: Qelin Baitingmaster at: 6/12/03 7:15 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
The NPC on the western shore of LoIO tells all about Veksar, Garudon (the dragon trapped inside), and why he's trapped there to begin with.<br />
<br />
He also gives out a quest to return to him four of any type of the &quot;generic&quot; weapons that drop inside.  <br />
<br />
Here's his entire conversation for those too lazy to go talk with him  <br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood regards you indifferently -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Syrik Iceblood'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''Oh, hello.  You caught me while I was in thought.  Currently I am researching the methodology used in smithing weapons during the age of [Veksar].  If you wish to help, let me know.  I will take any [help] available, be it friend or foe to the legions of Cabilis.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what is veksar?'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''Veksar was an opulent resort enjoyed by privileged nobles and generals of the empire.  It was built near a small freshwater spring with legendary restorative properties, this small outpost was considered one of the finest treasures of the realm.  Highly-ranked Iksar from the empire came here to cure their illness and extend their lives with the mystical [waters].  This town was originally created by the Kylong tribe of Iksar, but was assimilated into the ranks of Venril Sathir when he united the five tribes.  Many [legendary Iksar] lived there.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what waters'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''Veksar was guarded from the constant attack of dragons and the skulking bands of goblins living in the nearby hills.  For years the city thrived with all sorts of visitors.  Soldiers harmed by the war were sent here to mend their wounds.  High-ranking officials came here to relax and escape the tedium of war.  Even Iksar commoners came here desperate to cure whatever ailed them.  Since the war with the dragons was always escalating, a massive dome was built overhead to keep the attacks of the dragons away.  In spite of efforts, the [dragons] found a way to attack.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what dragons'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''Trakanon sent many dragons here to scout out why this town was so popular.  After learning about the Iksar being healed, he knew that he had to take action on the city.  He formed a plan to first cripple the cities walls so that their own dome would trap them, and then flood the waters of the healing spring.  This would not only trap them, but also dilute the waters, preventing any further healing from taking place.  [Garudon] would lead in the direct attack of the town.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'who is Garudon?'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''During the formation of Trakanon's ranks he did not garner the support he desired.  One of the first dragons to come to his side was Garudon.  He quickly grew to be Trakanon's most trusted ally, and aided in drawing support from the dragon ranks.  Because of his high ranking position Garudon would lead the [fight] against Veksar.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what fight'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''The Dragons clawed at the supporting pillars of the dome.  The town began to shake and the dome began to fall.  The Dragons fled from the pillars, but one was trapped.  Garudon was caught in a snare set up by the town's defense.  Crumbling to the ground, the dome sealed their fate.  Garudon fought with the Iksar from under the dome with no hope from escaping.  The Dragons then called upon the waters to flow, and flood the valley.  The spring was flooded, its magical properties lost forever.  The soldiers finally brought down Garudon.  With his last breath he let out a flame that scorched much of the dome and then fell from the air, crashing through the ceiling of the theatre that was built to entertain the Iksar on the mend.  Most of his [bones] still remain there, while others were ground up in necromantic ceremonies.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what bones'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''Scout reports tell of his bones laying scattered across the floor of the theater.  Because a constant surge of necromancy was needed to keep the citizens of Veksar animated it could not be stopped.  They would have to find a way to prevent the magic from flowing into the theater and reanimating Garudon himself.  The mystic words painted onto the wall of the theater seem to point to the fact that the flow of necromancy into the theater is stifled.  This is all the lore of the town of Veksar that I can recall.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what is veksar?'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''Veksar was an opulent resort enjoyed by privileged nobles and generals of the empire.  It was built near a small freshwater spring with legendary restorative properties, this small outpost was considered one of the finest treasures of the realm.  Highly-ranked Iksar from the empire came here to cure their illness and extend their lives with the mystical [waters].  This town was originally created by the Kylong tribe of Iksar, but was assimilated into the ranks of Venril Sathir when he united the five tribes.  Many [legendary Iksar] lived there.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what legendary iksar?'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''When the Kunzar armies marched upon the Kylong, the three greatest Kylong mystics shattered the medallion of Kylong, a holy relic of their tribe, and fled their mountain homes in order to prevent the Kunzar from reassembling it.  These three Kylong were [Verix Kylox], [Dakon Sythrax], and [Sirk Vemat].  As they fled from their tribe they knew that the chances to form the medallion together would be less if the Kylong split up.  Verix attempted to hide in the hills of the Dreadlands.  Dakon headed north to the Field of Bone.  Sirk Vemat headed to the Burning Woods to hide in the forest.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'who is verix kylox'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''Venril Sathir found Verix Kylox the shaman while he was combining the lands for undead.  Venril was angered by his lack of devotion.  For his punishment he was sacrificed, but resurrected to become a part of Venril's undead army.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'who is dakon sythrax'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''Dakon Sythrax the necromancer fled to the Field of Bone.  It was here that he raised a small troop of skeletons to build an underwater dungeon where he could hide his treasures.  He hid the amulet and some of his more powerful tomes here.  One of which was a great [book of necromancy].  The possessor of the book could have full control over an army of undead.    He left the skeletons to do his work and returned to surrender to the Kunzar's forces.  He was sent to Veksar to work through his days studying the effects of the spring.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what book of necromancy?'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''Xalgoz later discovered the cove and he took the medallion back to the five towers of Teraaz, which is now referred to as Kaesora.  He left all of the tomes because he did not find them of particular interest.  Decades after the war between the dragons and Iksar, a troll that fell from a passing ship found Sythrax's small cove.  The skeletons milled around in disarray.  After finding the book and reading what of it he could he found that the skeletons would do his bidding.  I have heard rumors that Sythrax was able to assume the form of a great lich to live through the decades.  His hatred for being trapped, and for being forced to work for Venril has built over the ages.  He only wants to escape this place so he can retrieve his medallion and books that he believes to be in the Field of Bone.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'who is sirk vemat'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''The Sarnak captured Sirk Vemat the warrior.  They took him to Chardok where they forced him to work in mining out caves that would be used as their city.  He still carried the medallion of the Kylong.  He knew that in death they would find it on his body so he decided to hide it.  He dug a hole as deep into the mountain as he could and placed it in the hole and covered it over.  I have heard tales that a slaving rat by the name of Niblek would find the necklace.  Niblek's love for shiny things meant that he would keep it with him, but would offer it as trade to anyone that had his favorite type of gems.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what help'<br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''We can tell from the weapons that we have taken back from the Bloodgill goblins, that their smithing process must have been very unique for them to remain so sharp after four thousand years of use.  Cabilis would like to study the weapons and learn this technique so we can better outfit our troopers.  If you will bring me four of the same weapon I will spread your name through our city, and one day you may be able to walk the streets.  I am looking for Steel Ch'Ror, Mak'Stor, So'Shar, Ta'Nak, Ga'Nak, and Re'Stek.  Until then I will reward you with whatever coin I can get from turning them in for you.''</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you turn in sets of 4 weapons you get the same faction +'s you get from turning in explorer knives/bone chips. <br />
<br />
Which is a bummer because I was hoping for something to help those other factions, like the necro guild.<br />
<br />
You get some minor coin, same amount you would get for selling the weapons (like 5 plat each max).</div></div><hr />

<br />
he does hit VERY hard, 900's on a 65th paladin with full aaxp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arghificious</div><div class="date">06-20-03, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only seen the Dragon Boneshards drop in the &quot;Theatre&quot; area, and I've hunted there in Veksar a LOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Goradoc</div><div class="date">06-21-03, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we tried and failed to this dragon the other day .  Very frustrating fight because the mob's hitbox is so small that you have to be ontop of him to hit him.  If he moves even a bit, odds are you'll be too close or too far away.  I'd say I missed at least half the time because of this issue.  We'll be back, but it was a very unsatisfying fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vishuz</div><div class="date">06-22-03, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting stuff about that Sythrax guy.<br />
<br />
That ogre who fell off the boat or whatever is Gharg Oberbord.  He drops Sythrax Building Plans for a shaman quest.<br />
<br />
Sythrax Guardian and Servant of Sythrax are also around him.  No point really to this post, other than I thought it was interesting they actually tied a seemingly out of place group of NPC's into Veksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_CallisonRog</div><div class="date">06-22-03, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, going off of what i've tried to gain from these posts, is that the &quot;theatre&quot; is the area of Veksar, adjacent to Garudon's spirit: up the long ramp to the right of him, that is guarded and occupied usually by spellbinders.  This is where I saw Blood Cult of Xev rape the dragon, and also where the boneshards are to be collected? <br />
<br />
Are they just dropping off random guys there?</div></div><hr />
