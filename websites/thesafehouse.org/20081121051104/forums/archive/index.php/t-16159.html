I was scrolling through my skills the other day when I noticed that I had Safe Fall, and at a skill of 20ish, no less.  So I spent about an hour jumping off of every elevated surface I could find.  But for all my aching shins and dislocated hips I haven't gotten a single skill up.  Anyone know what's up with this?<br />

Cause I seriously have a feeling that I'm... :banghead <br />

<br />
Its ok I thought safe fall will s.....splat<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">elnator</div><div class="date">03-18-05, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm mine is working.  It's gone up a few times but not everytime I've jumped and NEVER when I took dmg.  I think the key is to fall far enough to take dmg if you were 'normal' but not far enough that you exceed your current skill level.<br />
<br />
Just a hunch, I haven't played with it much but mine is up in the 30's from normal play.</div></div><hr />
