<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omani</div><div class="date">03-21-07, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, like the other day by Renton Keep, this kindly Sorcerer realized I was a rogue and immediately started the unmerciful ganking.<br />
<br />
Round 1 = Me dead without even knowing what hit me.  I was in group with another Sorc, but the one that killed us was 20 and spanked us both.<br />
<br />
Round 2 = I recover my body and gear and think to myself, oh the Sorc must be gone, but a few seconds later I see the /say Hey how's it going... Sorc sees me in stealth, but of course I see nada... few seconds later I'm dead again, but I got him down to 75 percent using thrown daggers, woo hoo.<br />
<br />
Round 3 = I start xp'ing once again because I figure I'll just keep coming back to get my level 20 dammit.  All of a sudden, .... you got it from parts unknown, Kblam... but this time I die and the sorc that was in my group gets the upper hand on the other sorc.... go figure I make good bait?<br />
<br />
Round 4 = The two sorc are in a major fight and i get there as quick as I can.... the sorc in my group dies, but I see my chance... I got in a backstab... oh... that actually missed, and I used some of our other skills... but hmmm, they missed too... then it happened kblam and the sorc is down to 10 percent hp... only problem is I'm at 30 percent and trying to get daggers thrown at him cuz I'm thinking... I got him... I got him... But KBLAM!!! He does that spell that slows you down like you are moving..... in... slow.... motion... so now like I'm throwing daggers like crazy and I see him go down to 1 percent and I'm at 10.... then he just went and disappeared on me.<br />

So like, I almost killed a sorc tha otha day.............</div></div><hr />
