<br />
Sony has announced that the 40GB version of the PS3 will enter the European market on Oct. 10th, for a price of €399 ($565). The unit sports only two USB ports (instead of four) and does not include the multi-memory ports. And, in a move we absolutely cannot understand, the new model is not backwards compatible with PS2 discs. Seriously.<br />
<br />
Since BC is handled by software emulation (in the 80GB model), why is it gone from the 40-gigger? It's not that DVD support has been removed from the Blu-ray drive, as Sony continues to hype DVD movie upscaling. But the official line is, &quot;the new model is no longer backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles, reflecting both the reduced emphasis placed on this feature amongst later purchasers of PS3, as well as the availability of a more extensive line-up of PS3 specific titles.&quot; Extensive? Don't even get us started...<br />
<br />
If BC's on your checklist, you best scoop up a Starter Pack (now €499) &quot;while stocks last.&quot; <br />

<br />
That said, I still fail to understand what Sony is doing here. Generally speaking those holding out for a cheaper PS3 are the ones who would Most desire the backwards compatibility. I cannot imagine them thinking my group would be the majority on any level for that kind of purchase.</div></div><hr />

What they're obviously doing is desperately trying to make a version of the system thats cheaper to make so they can get people to buy one.<br />

Backwards compatibility isn't that big a deal.<br />

People who want to play PS2 games can spend 50 bucks on a ps2.  PS3 owners who want to play their old PS2 games...still have their PS2.<br />

They want people to buy the PS3 to play PS3 games and Bluerays.</div></div><hr />

Put another way, how does a dated piece of technology end up being a sizable cost on top of the PS3's already expensive hardware. Or is it just one of those costs they can't justify in the sales meeting.</div></div><hr />

Which is why the switched to software bc, so why is it hard to put the software in thats already coded into these things?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">10-06-07, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The North American version of the 20GB and 60GB PS3 had the PS2's hardware in it, but the 80GB North American PS3 and european PS3s use software emulation.  Unless there is some hardware needed on the motherboard, the lack of backwards compatibility is an artificial limitation to keep the higher priced versions selling.  I would've thought they'd simply go the 20GB PS3 route and just make a lot less of them, so when the buyer finds out the cheap one is out of stock there's a chance they'll buy the more expensive version instead.<br />
<br />
As a pretty decent kick to the crotch of Sony I saw this article (http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=137448) today, titled &quot;At current rate, PS3 may sell less than GameCube&quot;.  While I think the PS3 will probably end up selling decently a year or two down the line when the cost of the Blu-ray player in it doesn't inflate the price so much, it really seems that they didn't care about winning this generation's console war so long as it would allow them to get Blu-ray into the homes of enough people for them to win the Blu-ray/HD-DVD format war.  Just wait until next year when they announce the $299 PS3 that won't play PS3 games, it'll just be a Blu-ray player :b</div></div><hr />

I mean, does Sony need competition to mess up? I don't think they do, but it would be interesting to see what they'd do if there was no competition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I think they are headed in the right direction. At $399 they are at least aproaching reasonable, and frankly the only bad thing about the system really was the rediculous price tag.<br />
<br />
 From what im reading, and this is from the euro version so it could change for us in the states, they are bundling it with a blueray copy of spiderman 3, while this is fine with me, free stuff is free stuff, id much rather they bundled it with a game, say motostorm, or resistance.<br />
<br />
Overall id say its good news if you are wanting a PS3<br />
<br />
edit: also from what i'v heard its really simple to upgrade the HD on the PS3 so the smaller HD size isnt realy that big a deal, if you are experienced at working on your own computer anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was actually only partial software emulation.  It still has the GPU chip in it.<br />
<br />
Still though, even at that, I'm not seeing how a 6 year old GPU, a slightly smaller hard drive, and some media card slots = $100 savings.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to what happens when a company designs a blu-ray player that plays games instead of a gaming console that plays movies.</div></div><hr />

if you want a media Center , a lot say that Xbox is better to handle that ( more hacks for it ) <br />
<br />
<br />
Wait, what?<br />
<br />

<br />
who said Sony think of it as game system ? , they want it to sell blue ray ( just like the PSP to sell the whatever its thing name is )  media / movies , games are after thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chromite</div><div class="date">10-30-07, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The title of this thread is incorrect.  The 40GB PS3 has Software Emulation for PS1 games, and no emulation at all for PS2 games but this may change if/when they release a full software emulation in the future.<br />
<br />
Also, in the Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction game commercial (see other thread) they advertise at the end of the commercial that the PS3 price starts at $399.00.<br />
<br />
Also, some things that are different with the 40GB than the other models:<br />
<br />
Lower Power Consumption due to 65nm and other things (135 watts vs around 200 watts)<br />
Fewer ventilation holes, showing that it runs cooler and needs less cooling.<br />
Only 2 USB ports<br />
Runs quieter than the 20GB/60GB and is even quieter than the 80GB<br />
Better Wireless and Bluetooth range/power<br />
<br />

Notice that the 40GB has a battery on it now.  I wonder what for...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">10-30-07, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The battery is reportedly for maintaining settings while the console is turned off.<br />
<br />
To be honest, with the smaller motherboard and 65nm fabrication, I'm wondering if Sony will change the PS3's 'George Foreman Grill' appearance for a smaller footprint (and a flat top that might be the perfect size for sitting a slim PS2, or a small rack for games/Blu-ray disks on top of it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deuce</div><div class="date">10-30-07, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well sony has done refreshes with all of its consoles so far, so I'm sure to reboost sales after awhile they will do a refresh, as they've done with the ps1,2 and psp.</div></div><hr />
