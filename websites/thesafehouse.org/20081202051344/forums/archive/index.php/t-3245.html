<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay. I'm trying to create some Half plate armour plus 1 of plus3parryness as the uber goody in a mod. How do I do it? I go through the item wizard, but when I get to the properties wizard it sets the base armour type as scale mail and I can't change it. How do I make it half plate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it is a drop the easiest way to do it is on the creature who drops it.<br />
<br />
1.  Bring up the Edit of the creature in question.<br />
<br />
2.  Click on the Inventory Button.<br />
<br />
3.  Click on the standard list and open the heavy armor and select the half-plate +1.<br />
<br />
4.  Right Click and Edit Copy<br />
<br />
5.  Give it a name, and a blueprint name and tag<br />
<br />
6. Give it the added skill property on the property page<br />
<br />
That should do it for ya</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup, click the item thingy (little sword) click over to custom, right click under the armor section you want to work on and tell it to create a new item.<br />
<br />
once in the wizard click properties and select across the things you want. then on the right side click the property and hit edit to give it the adjustments you want. 1 Crow bad news<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you select heavy armor it defaults to Scale Male (AC4) armor.  I don't see a way to change that, your best bet is to follow the example I gave above.  It does create a brand new item, but it does use an existing item to do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you can.  That is why you use EDIT COPY.  It keeps the original and gives you your custom item.  (If you make a custom item, play around with the look of it, too!  Fashion is everything, you know!)<br />
<br />
For instance:<br />
<br />
 <br />
Telurinon Aelvenborne, 52nd Rake of Black IsleMangore Orcsplitter, 40th Warrior of Black IsleDewin gan'Bran, 28th Wizard of black Isle<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_I love Nicole</div><div class="date">09-06-02, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How would i got about making this to put on a character...for instance i am at ch 2.. and am about to kill Karathis ( 4th werewolf ) and say i want him to drop  &quot;the LS of uber thx np!&quot; ?? I have tried tinkering around...but can't seem to find a way, a step by step guide would be nice??? Or even be able to just go ahead and place it on my character???<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks mythas<br />
<br />
Edit...Second Question!<br />
<br />
Okay lets say i make a module? just a normal city interior...i place a chest in it with some items i made? is there a way for My character in Ch 2 to enter the mod. and then go back to Ch2 where he was???  Even if i had to restart Ch 2 that would be worth it to do...  ( reason being that i have a ranger its my first char on NWN and one i would like to keep, but is having a hard time in the game so i made some things that will give him a lil boost in abilites... i.e i thought wis would be important so as a ranger i have like 15 wis i belive, and str is really lacking....)<br />
<br />
So anyways i created a mod Just a city interior, i placed a chest in it with my items that i want... do i need to do anything else, like put in a starting point or something..or will my char start where the arrow thingy is??<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and replies<br />
<br />

<br />
Just load up your saved SP game, go to options and hit &quot;Save Character.&quot;  Then you can exit and start a new game, choose your module, check the box to show pre-made characters.  Select your character that you exported, go into the mod, pickup items, Save Character again, exit.  Go back to single player, start new game, select chap. 2, show pre-made select your latest character export, etc... EverQuest, E'ci server:<br />

<br />
Honestly, the item wizard doesn't do much; its easier to go to the palette, find a base item you want to change, and right click 'Edit Copy'.<br />
