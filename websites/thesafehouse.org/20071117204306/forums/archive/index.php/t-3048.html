<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eriste of Innoruuk</div><div class="date">04-21-03, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently working on a series of illustrated d20 character sheets, and because I'm personally a rogue fan the first set will be rogue themed.  My own character is an elven rogue, so the first two illustrations will be the same, but I'd like to fill out the set a bit more before I move on to another class.<br />
<br />
So, my question is... what do your d20 rogues look like?  If I get enough input on this query I hope to use popular roguish features to illustrate the other character sheets, so theoretically there would be a sheet available in the future that would be a good match for your character, although I likely wouldn't turn one out that was an exact duplicate (if I'm too specific not enough people will be able to make use of the sheet).<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested, the finished sheets will be available for free download from my website (the first set should begin to be available within the week).  Since the site features mature fantasy artwork, and also some unrelated pinup artwork, I won't link it here, but you can check my profile for more information or email me (also through my profile) and I can send you the URL...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">04-21-03, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the description of my Rogue/Bard as given to my GM.  He is a 28 year old human male.<br />
<br />
I am medium height, perhaps a bit smallish.  I have long flowing pure white hair, typically worn loose in town, but braided when traveling.  I have delicate features on a slim face, that seems to smile constantly and I have laugh lines around my eyes.  I am very pale, despite spending as much time travelling as I have, which many take as albinism.  I appear blind, with my eyes a milky white behind the pupils and the iris being bleach white.  I use a walking stick to help me walk about town, even though it is not truly needed in most cases -- I like the fact that people tend to discount me as a threat due to it.<br />
<br />
Typically, I wear a light blue tunic with a light brown leather vest, dark blue trousers and light brown soft leather boots. When travelling, or expecting danger, I will wear darker clothes and as heavy a cloak/hat so I can to protect my skin from exposure.  I wear armor (a light mithril chain shirt, under my clothes) when needed, and always have my rapier with me.  If I am travelling only with friends, I drop the &quot;blind&quot; pretense and will carry a small crossbow, but I do not if there are strangers in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordOfChains</div><div class="date">04-25-03, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fighter/Rogue/Assassin (I'm an evil little bastard! Neutral Evil, actually...) description. This should be freaky...<br />
<br />
Due to a strange genetic birth defect, my character is an elf in his middle 400s that looks like an average adolescent (approximately like a 10 year old human). He stands some 3 feet- 9 inches tall, slight build, with gray eyes and black hair that he keeps slicked back onto his head. His reach and attributes are unaffected by his condition though, making his arms slightly longer than they should be for his size, a fact he keeps hidden with his exceptionally long and wide tunic sleeves.<br />
<br />
His clothing is primarily black, except for the electric blue trim and sleeves on his tunic. As previously mentioned, the sleeves on his tunic have been lengthened and the cuffs widened in order to conceal his slightly elongated arms and a cache of weaponry that he keeps at the ready, including several daggers and a garrote.<br />
<br />
Being in a high-powered campaign, he is a Ftr 8/ Rog 6/ Asn 6 with bracers of dexterity +6, boots of striding and springing, 2 shortswords (both are +2 of speed/sure striking), multiple throwing daggers +1 of sure striking, a +1 morningstar he keeps tied to his back (under the tunic), and a periapt of natural armor +4 (which is hidden underneath the tunic).<br />
<br />
The tunic itself is enchanted, bestowing a +1 armor bonus and the Silent Moves and Shadow qualities upon him.<br />
<br />
Stats are: Str 14, Dex 28, Con 12, Int 18, Wis 12, Cha 16<br />
Feats are: Weapon Focus (shortsword), Weapon Specialization (shortsword), Weapon Finesse (shortsword), dodge, mobility, improved initiative, improved combat reflexes, ambidexterity, parry, improved parry, two-weapon fighting, imp two-weapon fighting, greater two-weapon fighting.<br />
<br />
When in combat, he feigns fright and incapability until the enemy turns his back on him or he is able to get into proper position. He studies his target well, and leaps in with an attempt to stab his opponent in the spine (death attack), and then throws himself into battle with a speed and viciousness that often causes the opposition to break and run before they get mowed down in the flurry of scything blades.<br />
<br />
As for his personality, he is pissed... constantly. He feels the world owes him for his defect, and he'll DAMN well take what he rightfully deserves, although he's smart enough to make it look like somebody else did it (but he's not averse to hunting down whoever's trying to catch him and sending him to the nine hells). He plays the part of a naive child who is tagging along with the party for @#%$ and giggles (when he can't come up with any other particularly sarcastic excuse) rather well, and the rest of the party makes sure to play along when strangers are in the group. The party knows his true nature, and avoids making him mad (calling him Kid, Boy, Child, or any other form of youth has a very good chance of sending him into a ravening frenzy), but it is all they can do to keep him from grabbing all the treasure before they can split it fairly (which irritates him to no end). WHY he tags along with them, they don't know, but they are thankful that he doesn't tag along with anybody that might one day try to kill them. They also find him indispensable with regard to his general problem-solving capabilities (if there's loot involved, he's more than happy to help!)<br />
<br />
Favored Sayings:<br />
<br />
&quot;DON'T CODDLE ME, MAN-PUP! I'M OLDER THAN YOUR FAMILY TREE!&quot; (ravening frenzy... usually followed up with a sword in the offender's chest, occurs when he's not trying to act like a kid)<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm spontaneously combusting with joy.&quot; (sarcasm)<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look! A talking dead man/woman, How novel!&quot; (he makes negotiations difficult when he's grumpy)<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee mister! You're swell! piece of rotting worm-ridden pig vomit... one more crack like that and I'll castrate you with my knee...&quot;<br />
<br />
That's all... maybe too much information, but that's me for ya. Edited by: LordOfChains at: 4/25/03 9:53:34 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">04-29-03, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the description for mine - note I didn't want anyone to know that I'm a rogue, and wrote my description to sound more like a ranger.  <br />
<br />
Character description:<br />
Banariel Lianodel stands just over five feet tall, and<br />
appears much thinner than would a human woman of the<br />
same height, a human might say she appears to be about<br />
ten years old from first glance.<br />
<br />
A lock of slightly wavy silver hair falls across her<br />
right eye, which she is constantly smoothing it back<br />
behind her pointed ear, only to have it fall right<br />
back down. As a result, she has a slightly perturbed<br />
look on her face most of the time. Her amber eyes,<br />
when not covered with hair, have a warm glow to them,<br />
and tend to constantly be scanning her surroundings.<br />
<br />
She is dressed in sturdy but loose fitting clothing,<br />
with a supple leather vest, leggings, boots, and<br />
bracers completing the outfit. Her tanned skin and<br />
the crafted longbow slung across her back tell you<br />
that this is an elf that probably spends a lot of her<br />
time in the outdoors. A small amythyst winks from a<br />
ring on her left hand. A longsword hangs from a<br />
scabbard on her belt.<br />
<br />
When she speaks, you find that she speaks very slowly<br />
and patiently, not quite condecendingly - more like an<br />
parent to a child, especially to non-elves. Her<br />
accent is completely nondescript, you cannot tell<br />
where she is from or where she has lived.  (Redeemed &amp; full of Rage)<br />
