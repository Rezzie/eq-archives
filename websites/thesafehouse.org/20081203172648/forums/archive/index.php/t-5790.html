still is sitting, still is sitting,<br />
on that palid bust of Palice just above my chamber door.<br />
And his eyes have all the seeming<br />
of a demon that is dreaming,<br />
and the lamplight o'er him streaming<br />
throws his shadow on the floor.<br />
And my soul from out that shadow,<br />
that lies floating on the floor,<br />
shall be lifted, Nevermore.<br />

I couldn't think of a good title for the original post. I didn't want to do something like &quot;W00t! another RB on tarew marr!!!1!!1!&quot;, cause there are a lot of those, and frankly, getting a RB nowadays isn't so much of an accomplishment.

Wasn't Edgar allen Poe pretty much wasted during the time he wrote the Raven ?  I heard that he -experimented- with drugs during that time hehe.  Just curious... I'll go back to lurking again</div></div><hr />

<br />
 JABBERWOCKY<br />
<br />
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br />
<br />
`Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br />
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br />
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br />
The frumious Bandersnatch!'<br />
<br />
He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br />
Long time the manxome foe he sought--<br />
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br />
And stood awhile in thought.<br />
<br />
And as in uffish thought he stood,<br />
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br />
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br />
And burbled as it came!<br />
<br />
One, two! One, two! And through and through<br />
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br />
He left it dead, and with its head<br />
He went galumphing back.<br />
<br />
`And has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br />
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br />
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br />
He chortled in his joy.<br />
<br />
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br />
