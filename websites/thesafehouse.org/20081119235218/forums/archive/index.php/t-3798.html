<br />
-lots saying it's popped on them during/otw to xanamech, done the script 4x so far, no junkbeast.<br />
<br />
-some say it spawns in the &quot;junkyard&quot;(large open non valley area, two in the zone one before and past where dragon is), but i've cleared this for about 4 hours with nothing.<br />
<br />
-noticed an odd spider that resembles the ones you stop from entering MB room during his script, figured it was a ph(it roams between one gate before left junkyard and to dragons door) but didn't see a junkbeast on next spawn cycle after it, nor another unique spider(name escapes me but if you've seen it you know what i'm talking about)<br />
<br />
-also killed some odd named slime, not like the common ones, was fully MR, hit for 450ish, lots of hp, dropped nothing...<br />
<br />
-alla's had a post saying it is definately the &quot;left junkyard&quot; and eight spawn<br />
<br />
<br />
So, anyone know for sure? <br />
<br />
8hrs y/n?<br />
Slime/spider connected?<br />
Still spawns in junkyards?<br />

He popped on the path as we were going through the first gate.  Dunno, he may wander though.  I think he's an entirely random spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_stehle</div><div class="date">10-29-03, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it has been discussed in the aformentioned link, it is a spawnable mob.  It just isn't possible to tell what the PH mob is though.  Just kill from the gnome to xanamech over and over again.<br />
<br />
10+ JB kills and counting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cianne Shadowstab</div><div class="date">10-30-03, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The JB does have a definable PH. When you take a right at the Gnome house and go down that path until it bends left, there is an erratic model that never leaves the area. It's usually pathing into the wall or something, but that is the PH and the JunkBeast will spawn there.</div></div><hr />
