And now that PoP is in my hot little hands, I can't find a single piece of information about them. I searched PoK high and low and can't find a single NPC or book who's got some information about them.<br />
<br />
I feel like I've been robbed somehow. I can't understand why this would be such a mystery.<br />
<br />
It's entirely possible that someone out there knows something. I just wish I could get a clue on where to begin.<br />

<br />
On the other hand the fletching vendor piped right up and I didn't have my GM knife equipped at the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_KayleighDrake</div><div class="date">10-23-02, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've concluded that the new poisons are a lie and are not in fact in game.<br />
<br />
At least that's what I'm going to tell myself until we see something, no, anything, that indicates the opposite.<br />

I personally doubt they require you to be 250 in skill to use.</div></div><hr />

Means like our old poisons too. (Contact I , II , ...)<br />
So these only able to make at Skill 250 cant be.<br />

The quests/hints NPCs give are triggered off of that.<br />
<br />
Advanced Vials can be made with pottery OR tinkering.<br />
<br />
The GM Seal summons the bottle used to combine 10 poisons into a 10 charge one, from what I hear.<br />
<br />
The info is coming in.  We just need to piece it together.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_twinbabas</div><div class="date">10-25-02, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Summary of what I have so far:<br />
<br />
To obtain multi-charge poisons you need the following things done:<br />
<br />
pub146.ezboard.com/fthesa...5768.topic<br />
<br />
You need to complete the renux quest to obtain a Poison trohpy called a SEAL:  You need a GM Poison Trophy (called vial), all 8 Tier IV poisons, Eyerazzia (from PoF).<br />
<br />
The new Poison seal, summons a no rent 10 slot container which works like a bearskin potion bag.  You can't use this container to make multiple charges of old world poisons.<br />
<br />
Recipes for the new poisons, I've found the best link here:<br />

Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
