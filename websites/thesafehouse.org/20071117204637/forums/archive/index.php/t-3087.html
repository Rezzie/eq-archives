<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">07-06-03, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Multiclassing in 3e simply lets you take your next level and apply it to another class.  So if you're 2nd level, and you reach third, you can either take a 3rd level in the same class, or stay second level in the first, and take all the skills and abilities of a first level in a second class.<br />
<br />
I'm particularly partial to fighter levels for a rogue, at least one or two, because you get nice BAB, and those bonus feats are really nice additions to a rogue's abilities.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you could go with Barbarian levels, and get the bonus movement, rage, and extra hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Or if you're feeling crazy and have the charisma for it, take a level of sorcerer and pick up ray of frost.  Range touch attack sneak attack as a zero level spell is pretty sweet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Esliim Karnth</div><div class="date">07-07-03, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I don't have the charisma for a Sorcerer, it's only 10...had to put that 10 somewhere...<br />
<br />
Anyway, Fighter sounds good, but what's a BAB( )?  What about a Cleric?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">07-07-03, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BAB is base attack bonus.  Fighters get a bonus to attack equal to their level, and every 5 levels get an extra attack at a reduce bonus.  Rogues get their bonuses at a rate slower than every level, so a level of fighter will let you get an extra bonus to your to-hit rolls that you may not have gotten with a level of rogue.  <br />
<br />
As for cleric, if you took a level of a cleric with the trickery domain, that certainly would be a nice addition to your skill set.<br />
<br />
You can read more about the base attack bonus in the SRD that was linked to you before.  Similarly, cleric spells, their domains and granted powers are available in the SRD as well.  You really need to read through that stuff bigtime, because no one is going to be able (or willing) to explain to you how to play from start to finish from scratch.  Answering the odd question is fine, but I don't think anyone has time to answer questions like what base attack bonus is and means.<br />
<br />
If it's too hard to follow the SRD, and you have Kazaa, then DL the player's handbook from it in PDF format and read through it that way.</div></div><hr />

Spells like alter-self, spider climb, mage armor, and invisibility will help augment your natural rogue abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Esliim Karnth</div><div class="date">07-07-03, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've read a good bit of that SRD stuff, really interesting.  I just was unfamiliar with the acronym.  Well, I'm certain that the sneak-attack will become VERY useful...yeah.  Ah yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mdar kelf</div><div class="date">07-08-03, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you could add in a level of wizard.<br />
<br />
You have to prepare the spells ahead of time. must get a spell book and component pouch. The plus side is that you get the scribe scroll feat for free, you have to blow exp on this, but if you choose to scribe spells at level 1, instead at max wizard level, it should be minmal.<br />
<br />
Also. Wizards are an elf's favoured class. which means they do not count when determining if you have an EXP penalty.<br />
<br />
Normaly when people take up multiple classes they suffer an exp penalty if the classes are more then 2 levels apart.<br />
so a 1/3 sorc/cleric wouldn't suffer one. but a 1/4 sorc/cleric would suffer a 20% exp penalty.<br />
<br />
if you are 1/4/7 let's say, sorc/cleric/rogue the penalty would be 40%<br />
<br />
most races have a favoured class. which means it doesn't count towards this penalty. Elves favoured class is wizard, a humans is her highest class level. A half-orcs is barbarin.<br />
<br />
the PHB could probably explain this better then I can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">07-08-03, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Half elves have no favored multi-class (Same with humans) this means that the first class they take is their favored.<br />
<br />
So you can multi-class for free with humans/half-elves (for the first 2 classes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">07-08-03, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I believe it means that whatever class happens to be highest is your favored class.<br />
<br />
A human that is 2/3/4 in f/r/b won't suffer the 20%<br />
<br />
If he levels up to 2/4/4 he will suffer the 20%<br />
<br />
If he levels up to 2/5/4 he will suffer the 20%<br />
<br />
If he levels up to 3/5/4 he will not suffer the 20%</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be true. They don't have a favored class by default, but rather their highest class counts as favored. Everquest:<br />
