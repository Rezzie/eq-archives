 Straight Info about the Enron Corp.: <br />
<br />
1. Enron's chairman did meet with the president and the vice <br />
president in the Oval Office. <br />
<br />
2. Enron did give $420,000 to the president's party over three <br />
years. <br />
<br />
3. Enron donated $100,000 to the president's inauguration <br />
festivities. <br />
 <br />
4. The Enron chairman did stay at the White House 11 times. <br />
<br />
5. The Enron Corp. had access to the administration at its <br />
highest levels and even enlisted the Commerce and State Departments to grease <br />
deals for it. <br />
<br />
6. The taxpayer-supported Export-Import Bank subsidized Enron for<br />
more than $600 million in just one transaction. <br />
<br />
 SCANDALOUS - Right??? <br />
<br />
 BUT - Guess What? The president under whom all this <br />
happened WAS NOT George W. Bush! <br />
<br />
 SURPRISE!!! - It was Bill Clinton! <br />
<br />
Feel Free to pass this on to whoever!</div></div><hr />

Oh, and it may come as a shock to a few of you, but &quot;Enron&quot; still exists... kinda. New management/different name/different structure. Wraine aka &quot;The Spine Tickler!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">10-09-03, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, this is probably a response to people like a friend of mine that thinks that the entire Enron scandal is Bush's fault. Of course, he tends to blame most government scandal and corporate corruption on Bush and the Republicans.</div></div><hr />

Ok, if Enron was in the news, sure, but just dragging up crap from the past isn't a good reason to post stuff.</div></div><hr />

Don't you know? Every event that becomes public during a president's term is a direct result of that term, and subject to no other influence. Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

Come on guys, second time today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">10-09-03, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The snopes thing only debunks one of the items listed above.<br />
<br />
&quot;4. The Enron chairman did stay at the White House 11 times.&quot;<br />
<br />
It does say that they gave more to Republicans, than shown above but that doesn't really make the other statements false by any means.<br />
<br />
My point? Virtually every company is going to try and curry favor with both major political parties, and every administration. As Nenjin said above, It's lobbying.<br />
<br />
Money is always, and I mean always going to be attracted to power.<br />
<br />
My thoughts are that if we were to, remove a lot of the power from the government when practical, and then there will be less opportunity for corruption, in that there wouldn't be as much governmental influence to buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-09-03, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then it becomes a question of whether the individual being lobbied to puts more stock in the issue and the best intrests of those effected, or the campaign support/damage being waved in their face. THAT, however, is another thread entirely.</div></div><hr />
