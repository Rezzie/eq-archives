<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greldek</div><div class="date">05-11-00, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, when I get bored sometimes, I go back to Crushbone and reak havoc on everything in sight,<br />
except for the tower. And usually give the loot to any who want it. Well, I decided to go get <br />
a shiny brass sheild for my bard friend, who is only level three. There didn't seem to be anyone<br />
camping the trainer. So I went on up. Nope trainer had spawned and just waiting for me to kill him.<br />
I kill him, then some lower level group comes up, and asks if they can at least take the cents around<br />
here, I didn't mind. After a few trainers spawn, the group thought they could KS me, so I let them pull the<br />
trainer off me, and suddenly unleash a 61 damage backstab. Trainer falls, they dont get anyting out of it, cept a few bruises. There was suddenly a rank odor coming from behind me. I turned my head to see a nasty lookin troll standing behind me, aslo in his 20th season. He peered at me, and says,&quot; I taked 'da traner, frem now on!&quot;. I tried to be nice about it, for he had no chance of getting the SBS before me. I started arguing with him, but sat down, and see this little message pop up: You begin to apply poison.<br />
You succesfully applied poison to your main weapon. <br />
I said,&quot;Well, since we're both grown, why don't we duel, and whoever wins, gets the spawn?&quot; He challanged me about 2 seconds after I said that. I stood up walked over to him, checked his equipment, ran behind him,accepted and backstabed for 50 some damage, also go the poison in him. The troll thinkin he could just<br />
turn and toe to toe me, did just that, so I played a bit with him, he hit my shadow a few times. I think he mighta knicked me once, then I was behind him, and landed a 60 point backstab. Well, he was getting quite<br />
mad at me, for I had almost full health and he was nearly at half. Keep in mind, I didnt use all backstabs from the back, I stayed toe to toe with him for quite sometime. He just couldn't hit me. He was getting dangerously low on life, and turned to run, just then my bloodclaw procs, and I land a 50 point backstab. He died. The group started cheering for me, then pulled my trainer that had just spawned! Well, I KSed it from them, and got the sheild for my bard friend. He came back his panties in a bundle, cussin at me, asking for a remach, I declined, for the last bout had left me with a scuffmark on my boot. And I don't like cleanin my boots. I soon left, and helped a group of people rip D'Vinns hear out. Also got my friend a dwarven ringmail tunic. Well soon there was a shout,&quot; GRELDEKS A DURTY CHEETER!!!&quot; And that was the last I heard of the 20th level weakl.. I mean warrior. Greldek Draegonbayte                                         &quot;Life is short and hard like a body building elf.&quot; -Bloodhound Gang</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm a little concerned about this cheating thing, though.  I mean, it's not really fair of you to use poison in a duel; after all, none of the other classes do it.  <br />
<br />
I suggest the following rules for fair duelling.  I urge Verant to implement these in code:<br />
<br />
* Rogues can't use poison or backstab.<br />
* Paladins can't use Lay of Hands; SK's can't use harm-touch.<br />
* Warriors have to remove their helm and breatplate.<br />
* Monks have to carry an extra 1000cp.  (They should be prepared to duel any time, and so a well-prepared monk should always have this on him, just in case.)<br />
* Bards may not sing songs that affect either themselves or their opponents.<br />
* Because of the differences in level caps, it is now only acceptable for a melee/hybrid to duel a caster who is 5/3's their level.  Duelling a caster of a level lower than this is clearly just picking on the weak and helpless.<br />
* Snares, roots, DoTs, SoWs, and nukes are all acceptable, as they are widely available to a variety of classes.<br />
