<br />
&quot;We've harshed on this game for awhile now, but mostly out of &quot;tough love&quot;.  we want it to be as great as we know it could be.  So Kudos to Sony Online and Lucasarts for finally acknowleging what everyone knew: the process of becoming a Jedi was totally lame.  Now, becoming a Jedi will be quest-oriented and more accessible to all players.  Also, Jedis won't suffer permanent death - good news to those who've invested months in becoming one.  Now about that space combat...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sounds like they are removing everything I hated about the Jedi system that I hated.  Anyone still play that has details about this?</div></div><hr />
