<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">09-16-03, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously, I can't understand why these corporate mascots are getting to do it with more hot women in a handful of commercials that I probably ever will in my life!<br />
<br />
First, theres that stupid alien thing that sells CD players and digital cameras and whatnot.  He has hot women throwing off their clothes and handcuffing themselves to him!  And why?  Cause he can apparently make a good mix CD?!  Big @#%$ deal!  You wanna know the secret to making a kickass mix CD?  Make the first song Blur - Song 2, and make the last song Faith No More - Epic.  Put whatever the @#%$ you want in the middle, childrens lullabyes, gregorian chants, it doesn't matter, it will still rock!  See, I'm a @#%$ master!  Wheres my @#%$ hot chicks!<br />
<br />
And then we have the Levatt Blue bear.  Not only does this bear get alot of women, he even gets a threesome!  And why?  Because he broke their @#%$ window!  Do you know what I'd get if I broke someone window and decided to bring them a cooler of beer as an I'm Sorry?  I'd probably get shot on their lawn and my cooler dragged into their house!<br />
<br />
Its a @#%$ bear and an I don't know what.  C'mon ladies, you don't need to be resorting to bestiality and whatever the hell you would call having sex with a weather balloon with eyes.  I'm right here!  Pick me instead!  I'll make you mix CDs and smash your windows till you can't stand it anymore!!<br />
<br />
Come on! @#%$!!! &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />

Ok, I have diagnosed your problem with Getting Some. Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heard a fairly reliable rumor from multiple sources that she got trashed at a party and trained the whole football team.<br />

Classy.<br />

I don't think that's the type of attention you're looking for though.   gnmish.gearbinder.ring.warden.sullon.zek<br />
