<br />
I've completed the bards Gorget, Bracer, and Pauldron quests and am still working on the BP, Greaves, Healm, Sword, Girdle, and Cloak. <br />
<br />
It is unfortunate that the new Luclin Models do not show the gorget like the old models do  ( Lazy programers.....<br />
<br />
Personally... I think Verant has made the spawn ratio on the named ones a bit to low... On average it is taking me about 10-20 hours of exclusive camping on a set of mobs to get the named I am looking for to pop.... Shouldn't take that long  <br />
<br />
My last camp was the shadows in TS hunting for a tenacious shadow. I camped them with my 53 necro and 45 bard and was keeping the shadow population on the island down to about 2-5 at any given time, instead of the normal 20-30 mobs..... Was some heavy heavy pulling to do that... it took 3 days in all... about 15 hours worth of clearing the island.<br />
I saw only one other TS quest mob during that time as well... and killed the dark shadow about 15 times, lithe shadow about 5-6 times, and a couple others i don't remember.<br />

I gave Gazoon the 3 items he asks for, worried that this was the only pants quest that needed 3, not 4, items) and he took them and told me I need to do more.<br />
<br />
GM just contacted me about my petition; Gazoon does indeed ask for the wrong things for that quest.  I got no ETA on when the Wizard Pants quest would be fixed, but it is broken for now.<br />

<br />
First line yourself up so that both the torches are in line with you. Back up to almost the tree thingy, and cast root on the closest coterie. Make sure your root took, and run toward katta(make sure you dont pull the gladiator in front of the steps, but &quot;through&quot; the steps so he doesn agro bedlavar if hes up). Ok, if root didnt stick the first time, root again asap. you shouldnt need to root a 3rd time as they have low MR. Now target the gladiator or whatever the PH happens to be, and run to the katta zone entrance(try not to get adds). Snare, and kill. Fire based nukes do wonders to these guys =).<br />
<br />
Heres the layout:<br />

You have a better chance of finding one when the servers come up after a patch. I (and others) have found waay more pieces that way rather than camping.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wondering, how much are you seeing pieces going for in the bazaar on your server. On Rodcet, I'm seeing 50-100pp.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think 100pp is too  much (even though I once offered 1k for the primal earth rune because I was sick of camping it)</div></div><hr />

Colcannon brings up a good point, when the servers come back up after patch it's a virtual plethora of twilight mobs out there.  Keep an eye out for up coming patches and have a character camped out in the zone of the mob you're after.     The spirit gem comes from the cral ligi spiritlord (according to taylir.com) in twilight sea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rakenazure</div><div class="date">08-10-02, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read this whole string out of curiosity.  I see a lot of people asking exactly how to spawn the named quest aliens in Twilight Sea, but I don't recall having read the exact way it is done.  Here is exactly how you do it.<br />
<br />
You go to the hidden area.<br />
<br />
You kill warders and spiritwards that roam of the type that you are looking for.  ie, killing a grol baku warder that roams will spawn either a grol baku warder, a grol baku spiritward, or a grol baku named quest mob.  The same goes for the other two types.<br />
<br />
You do not kill any static spawns.<br />
<br />
You do not kill any warders or spiritwards that are static.<br />
<br />
You do not kill any roaming guardians or roaming workers.  This only spawns other guardians and workers of all three types.<br />
<br />
Also, the ph are ph for more than one type of named.  I do not know if each ph can spawn any named of its type or only a few.  But I do know they spawn at least a few as I got the same ones to spawn a few each.  Using this method it will take anyone that can clear the entire pool of mobs they are looking for before the respawn about 2 to 3 hours to spawn their named unless they are having some real bad luck.  Using this method you can see that you do not have to wipe out the whole zone and that your odds are not 1 in 70 or so.<br />
<br />
Don't let anything else lead you astray.  I assure you this is exactly how it is done.<br />
<br />
Also, not that it will help, cause it won't.  But to answer a couple questions for you people asking.<br />
<br />
When I spawned the painter he was exactly halfway between the bowl structure and the first tent to the left as you enter the hidden area.<br />
<br />
When I spawned the jeweler he was a few steps across the river from the bowl structure.</div></div><hr />

Give a look and you might find that piece your missing. I noticed lots of the gems were being sold. A few of the marks as well. Good luck to ya all!</div></div><hr />

The mark of seduction works on the turn in for the Mail of Concealment.  I did it on Friday, just said wtf and turned the stuff in.  So... Edited by: Raedar at: 9/9/02 8:17:18 am</div></div><hr />

The RvR for these is very very bad. The time required to completely acquire all the quest pieces for any given item is really comparitive to the Raster camp in Lower Guk, but the end result is comparitively slightly better than the armor given out for the new newbie quests (casters) or Ro quest armor (plate classes). <br />
<br />
The quests are almost all 50+ but the armor is 30+ caliber. Too bad   . I have sent emails to the developers corner of EQ hoping to get some sort of change made to these armors (better Stats, Focus Effects, low end buff, something pls!) but alas I am but one and not the UBER Furor, so VI doesn't listen to me like they do him. If there is enough feedback, maybe they'll look into making some changes. <br />
<br />
I am holding onto my armor pieces quested thus far....hoping beyond hope that they will do something to change them.<br />
