<br />
Okay, so I take the monsters score, I subtract 10(if even) or eleven(if odd) if 10 or higher to get the &quot;rating&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then they roll thier score, and I compare the roll to their rating.<br />
<br />
So I'm looking at the chart, and a minataur has a 19 average str.  Thats a &quot;rating&quot; of 8.<br />
<br />
So I look at the chart and I see that if they roll an 18 their score is 16.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
How is that possible.  How does a monster with an average str of HIGHER than 18, roll an 18, and end up with a 16?<br />
<br />
Am I supposed to add something to the number on the chart?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">04-20-02, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Direct quote from the GM guide:<br />
<br />
 Therefore, when creating a PC from the Monster Manual, check to see if the creature has any typical ability  scores of 10 or higher. If so, for each score, subtract 10 (if the score is even) or 11 (if the score is odd) to get the racial ability modifier. <br />
For example, a typical minotaur has a Strength score of 19, so its racial ability modifier is +8 (19-11= .  Roll the ability score (4d6, discarding the low die) and add the racial ability modifier to get the minotaur PC's Strength score.<br />
<br />
 For scores below 10, the procedure is different. First,  roll the ability score (4d6, discarding the low die), and compare the roll to the monster's average ability score on Table 2-5/2-6: Monster PC's Ability Scores.<br />
For example, the minotaur has a listed intelligence score of 7, so the player consults that column on Table 2-6. She then rolls 4d6, dropping the low result, and gets a 10. Checking the left-hand column on Table 2-6, she sees that her minotaur PC has an Intelligence score of 6.<br />

<br />
You know it's funny, I was reading those exact words and yet I still didn't get it.<br />
<br />
Game manuals should start making liberal use of bold text.</div></div><hr />
