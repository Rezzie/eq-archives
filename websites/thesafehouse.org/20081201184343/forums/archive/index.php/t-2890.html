<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zoogie</div><div class="date">02-17-02, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone play this game? I've read some reviews on the 'net which seem to say it's pretty good, and was wondering what the Safehouse's opinion is. Not exactly a  rogue styled game, but I could see some possibilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iscin</div><div class="date">02-18-02, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent game.  Definitely centered around Magic and Wizards.  But you can play any character you want really.<br />
<br />
   It supports the troupe style of play.  Where you regularly switch between who plays different characters and who GMs etc.  But you dont have to play it that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like it a lot - although I only rarely play it. It's best played with a group of about 6-9 people, with about 4-6 attending every time you play. So almost always a part of the covenant will remain at &quot;home&quot;.   ShadowCross Bladesong<br />

<br />
Do either of you have a PDF or Word document or something of the 4th Ed. Hand Book? <br />
<br />
I'm so cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">02-18-02, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The magic system is great. probably the best ever.<br />
<br />
I lie. Its the best ever.<br />
<br />
The rest of it is okay, except for the combat system which suckysuckysucksucks.<br />
<br />
I hear 4th ed combat system has clawed to the giddy heights of 'bad', however, so this may no longer be fair....<br />
<br />
Bolt an alternative combat system on and you're away!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zoogie</div><div class="date">02-18-02, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it is supposed to be a game centered around magic, y'know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">02-18-02, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its supposed to be a game set in the middle ages as well.... and Wizards do occasionally get into fights. If the enemy gets to him what do they do?<br />
<br />
Well, I'm still not entirely sure but it seems to take AGES.<br />
<br />
My fundamental rule. Any system which keeps your attention more on the system than on the action is a bad system.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zoogie</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, how would the Ars Magica combat system rank on that list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&amp;lt;roll&gt; 8! plus...err 5. I think. 13. Maybe.<br />
umm... that sounds...umm kinda high... I think you hit... maybe...for..like... some damage....<br />
<br />
Which edition were we using again?<br />
<br />
More seriously, the AM combat system varies widely from edition to edition, but sits somewhere between the extremes. It is also broken, mechanistic and generally sucky. I hear the lastest version is better, but we've just adopted our own so we don't care.</div></div><hr />
