+15% spell duration   <br />

well, that sounds nice doesnt it? I am here to tell you after leveling my chanter to level 44 that its broken.  I ALWAYS cast Clarity and Haste on Myself First so that they will fade first on me and the group doesn't have to ask me to buff them again. I got an extended Enchancement 3 item and now I am having problems with that.  You see, everyone else in the group always fades first on both of these when it should fade on me first.  It works great on me but for the rest of my group they always fade first.  I just thought I would post it here since this has massive traffic and because it effects everyone. After all, if you rogues actually have to ask for haste from the chanter then it looks like we arn't doing our job and should know that... but it's not us it's Extended Enhancment thats broken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I have a Rokyls Channeling Crystal (EE III) and it seems to be working fine for me.  My DMFs and Arch Shieldings are lasting longer.  However I rarely buff others so ... maybe it is borked.  When I do dmf someone else it the crystal glows or whatever.  Maybe I should time it when I cast it one someone else and myself to verify.</div></div><hr />

However, I have had group buffs wear off at different times on group members, despite none of us having zoned or gone LD, and all were level 60. It's usually not a wide variance, though.</div></div><hr />

If someone has a lag spike and doesn't get updated as fast... buffs will drop at different times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rekcim</div><div class="date">08-28-02, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that it is RANDOM from 1-15% increase everytime you cast it.  So you might get 15% on yourself and another, but one person gets a 5% increase and it wears off before yours.  All effects are random except for spell haste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we buff another grp...our personal buff is refreshed everytime (FoS,Brute,Cat)...So if you have shm in ur grp and ur buffs fade but yet he does not know it or doesnt refresh it immediately...thats why</div></div><hr />

Here is the snip from the patch message:<br />
June 6th, 2002. 3:00am<br />
------------------------------<br />
** Focus Items **<br />
- Spell duration foci affecting beneficial spells are no longer random. They now always extend the affected buffs for their maximum. (We never wanted to make it harder to time your buffs.)<br />
<br />
I do not know what could be causing this, just trying to suppress the confusion about it.<br />

Then do the smart thing and go to a caster board and ask them.   Casters group with us everyday as well but I bet there are not alot of Backstab questions over at Graffe's</div></div><hr />

Not true.. Some focus items work on (some) click effects. The effect must be a player spell, and some don't work (Spell Haste doesn't seem to work, Extended Affliction, Extended Range, do for example).<br />

When I use Jboots, epic clicky (I'm a chanter), Gobby earring, and various other click effects my shawl gives the message that it is working.  So clicky effects definitely get some benefit from extended duration.<br />
