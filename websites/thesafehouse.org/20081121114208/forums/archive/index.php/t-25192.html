<br />
Sure, I've already tried to solo the quest to get into the new area, didn't work out so well, died 8 times to do it .. but I was bored so there. Can't tell you how awesome it is to pull a room of 10 level 10's thinking oh god I'm gona die, then realizing I can pull them into the two blade traps and pull up my sheild .. they were sliced and diced and it was good.<br />
<br />
Other than that, having more bag is good, and stuff.</div></div><hr />

What kind of traps we talkin :P?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">07-15-06, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to time it right but there are three traps, right next to each other, acid, poison and fire. Two more traps down the line (blade spinny) and further on is an underwater corridor fully of about 80 of the aforementioned traps. I can turn them all off with an underwater breathing item, its not really needed but it will keep me from rushing to turn the traps off. Its easily swum without traps.</div></div><hr />
