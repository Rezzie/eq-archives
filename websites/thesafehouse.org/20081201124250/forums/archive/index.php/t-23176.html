So, I picked up a +1 Flaming Rapier, 'cause y'know... Burning Rapier (+1!).<br />
<br />
I encourage the rest of the guild to pick these up as well, if not for general damage output purposes, then for aesthetics or RP purposes... and they look damn cool. I sort've want them to be the guild's trademark, because it just fits. You can probably purchase them from other players for between 2000 and 3000gp, and they'll likely jump at the price, as vendors will only give you about 1000gp for them, so yeah... if you guys want to get behind this, I can finance them and just have people pay me back on delivery for them.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that any class can equip any weapon, you don't have to be proficient in them to look cool running around town, y'know?<br />
<br />
And I'll finish off with some pictures of Tea looking all badass.</div></div><hr />

Now that Rapier, is definitely Burning! :)</div></div><hr />
