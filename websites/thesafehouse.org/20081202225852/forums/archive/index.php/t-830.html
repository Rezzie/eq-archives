Not quite sure, but she's flippin.<br />
<br />
<br />
drama!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gaav</div><div class="date">03-04-04, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was a challenge that involved moving past the other teams members on planks.  And as always Richard played naked, apparently while moving past Sue, he made sure there was some intentional penis contact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilum</div><div class="date">03-04-04, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">She could have avoided said contact if she had chosen the other path.  Richard should not have done what he did, but she made a point of saying she wanted to go down the same path he was on forcing them to pass each other in close confines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Andorion</div><div class="date">03-04-04, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup Lilum, and the ONLY ONLY reason she made such a big deal and walked is for the $$MONEY$$.  She's going to (or already did) file a lawsuit against him, and I hope she gets laughed and booted straight out of the court room.<br />
<br />
If you have even a shred of pity for her, don't, she's a greedy bitch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorla</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really had to laugh when she was talking about how she's never thought about cheating on her husband, he was gonna be so mad, etc....  did she somehow forget that Richard isn't into women and isn't thinking of her either?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwin</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a big laugh out of that too. <br />
<br />
I am sorry but I smell lawsuit... &quot;hmmm... richard won a million and there is no @#$% chance in heck I am going to win, he rubbed his pee pee on me so I am gonna sue!&quot;<br />
<br />
As far as the rest of survivor I feel for the team that lost the rewards challenge especially since their teammate was pulling to split the food. Boom, they got nada!<br />
<br />
Then I cannot stand Shii Ann Huang she just pisses me off. I would rather have seen Susan win then her, I am crossing my fingers that she gets booted and booted soon!</div></div><hr />
