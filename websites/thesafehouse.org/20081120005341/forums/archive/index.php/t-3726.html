<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_corlathist</div><div class="date">07-18-03, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any trap?<br />
<br />
if so any ideas from zone in, where some traps are that spawn some of these.  i can think of traps that spawn <br />
frogs, earth elemental dust mobs, and earth initiates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Giledan Blackguard</div><div class="date">07-18-03, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any trap of the same mob type. To spawn A Korsician Warlord you have to pop the young frog traps. There is two i believe. And so on for ea mini.</div></div><hr />

I've spawned The Living Earth from what is normally a tree trap, and I've also spawned him from what is normally a dirt clod trap on the other side of the zone.</div></div><hr />

Most will see the one near zone in, the PH is a rock type mob behind the three trees.<br />

L being the Living Earth spawn point or PH<br />

C being croc trap mob, which can also spawn the name croc that drops ranger pet weapon (I think there are 2 other croc trap mobs, one in front of the skeleton room)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dubbo</div><div class="date">07-19-03, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I've had him spawn near the zone, it's been from the trap spot just to the left which normally spawns a tree (among the Ts). Also popped him near the mud ring where a magical collection of dust normally pops.<br />
<br />
Saw Glimmerstone and a Perfect Rock Formation in the caves... still hoping to see pristine gem golem. =|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_pafamal</div><div class="date">07-20-03, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the Pristine Gem Golem spawn in a static spot back in the caves, or can it be random from any trap popping mob back there?  Ran around for quite a while the other day and we couldnt seem to pop it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Derrict</div><div class="date">07-20-03, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can spawn at several of the trap mobs, not sure if all of them.  I've only seen the rock type name mob spawn in one spot but I've seen pristine spawn in 2 spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Khashik</div><div class="date">07-21-03, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So when you trigger the trap, is has a chance to spawn either a regular mob or the named?<br />
<br />
How often can the traps be triggered?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Derrict</div><div class="date">07-21-03, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, either PH or named, 99% of the time it's PH mob, ie a small rock monster.<br />
<br />
~ every 15-20 minutes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Khashik</div><div class="date">07-22-03, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you say &quot;traps&quot;, does that mean you walk over the trap to trigger it? I talked to some people in game and they seem to think that &quot;a small frog&quot; etc. is just a standard PH mob that spawns out in the open.<br />
<br />
Khashik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Derrict</div><div class="date">07-22-03, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, they spawn on top of you when you walk over it.  If you exp in earth -a, your puller is eventually going to re-trigger a trap mob and bring an extra mob to camp.<br />
<br />
A young frog is a trap mob that can spawn the frog named, it's at the base of the Peregrin temple.  I've spawned a young frog numerous times dragging corpses by that area.. definately not a normal static spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Wrennn</div><div class="date">07-25-03, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trap spawned mobs stay up indefinately once triggered. So if a rogue triggers a trap running around the mob will stay up and be standing on the trap when a group comes by later on. That is probably what makes people think they are static mobs. If you pull one of those prespawned trap mobs a second often spawns soon after because the trap has reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Derrict</div><div class="date">07-25-03, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try it some time - run behind Tantisala's door and spawn a name mob, it will despawn if not killed in about 15 min.  I've gotten him to spawn and have it despawn before being able to pull it, as have others.  If you spawn something like a hatchling in the open field, it will stay up.  We've spawned the name croc (prismatic basilisk) and have it despawn also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dubbo</div><div class="date">07-25-03, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen prismatic basilisk poof. Bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Wrennn</div><div class="date">07-27-03, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some named despawn fast, some dont. I have seen the monk weapon dropper spawn and depop in 30 minutes and I have seen Glimmerstone spawn and still be up 24 hours later.<br />
<br />
I guess the ones that drop good loot despawn and the others dont ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Alachandra Bakstalker</div><div class="date">11-15-03, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone spawned the Pristine from a trap recently.  Our rogues avidly check for this mob daily with no avail.  Or does he have a certain location?  Please elaborate with /loc of when you last saw this mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dubbo</div><div class="date">11-15-03, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seen Shimmering Gem Sentry in the caves several times recently. Once he stayed up for like two days before we killed him on the way to Arbitor. /clap for another IH4 mask</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Derrict</div><div class="date">11-16-03, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you'll most likely only see the pristine gem golem once right after the traps are set after a zone or server reset.  any of the trap mobs will stay up approx 15-20 min and despawn.  Glimmerstone and Shimmering Gem Sentry can spawn anywhere a rock / golem mob can spawn so the only way to get these to pop is by clearing the caves.  Neither one will despawn like the ones from the trap mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_QuentisLocksmythe</div><div class="date">11-17-03, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That seems to be the case, only spawns once right after reboot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Alachandra Bakstalker</div><div class="date">11-26-03, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today I spawned 3 named in the caves by walking over the traps there.  A Shimmering Gem Sentry, A Perfect Rock Formation, and Glimmerstone.  My question now is do these named have a common drop all the time and an ultra rare drop?  For instance on Allakhazams it shows that the pristine and glimmering mobs can drop the sharp gem formation.  Anyone out there who has gotten a sharp gem formation...and from what mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Derrict</div><div class="date">11-27-03, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pristine gem golem and shimmering gem sentry have the same loot table, the mask being common and the piercer being uncommon. Glimmerstone drops a 2hs, something like 52-39.  I got my SGF off the pristine gem golem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dubbo</div><div class="date">11-27-03, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">52/39 war/pal/sk, just another damned knight weapon that's going to rot unless you happen to have apps along on an arbitor kill. So tired of watching knight weapons rot (wake up SOE, this has been a big problem since friggin Velious) /sigh... the best is when you bother to kill Avatar of Mist and he drops 2 of the SK only 1hbs. &amp;lt;3</div></div><hr />

Was exp'ing in there today and had 7 pop in about 5 hours. We also had other named pop but finally the earth illusion can be farmed once again! I know this is an old thread but wanted to let yas know.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Before the only time you had a chance at the named warlord frog was on server up. After that he never spawned unless you were extremely lucky.<br />
