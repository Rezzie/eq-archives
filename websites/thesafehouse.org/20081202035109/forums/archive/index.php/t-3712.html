Quote:We've said that it is currently scheduled to come out in 2004 and that we have people dedicated to working on it now. Otherwise, we've been focusing most of the dev time, community interaction and PR on the upcoming Themed Publishes (&quot;Imperial Crackdown&quot;, &quot;Droid Invasion&quot;, etc). Expect to hear more about the Space Expansion in May or there abouts. <br />
