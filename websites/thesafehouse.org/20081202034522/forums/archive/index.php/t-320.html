<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glip the Gnome</div><div class="date">04-06-00, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A while back I had started a newbie dwarven character, forget what class I was (I think warrior) to hold some stuff for a friend of mine who was twinking.  We were sitting next to the bloodforge guy in the basement of the Kaladim warrior's guild when some half-elf walks in.  He of coursed conned red to me at 1st and had anon on so I wasnt sure what level he was.<br />
 <br />
 So I figure what the heck, I wanna have some fun.  So I typed something like the following:<br />
<br />
 &quot;Hail young adventurers! Is an honor to see such fine up and coming warriors in this fine city.  I was once just like you, young and adventerous, but my axe wielding days are over.  I maintain a fine living crafting special armor that I was fortunate enough to stumble upon the recipe for.&quot;<br />
<br />
My friend who had caught on, says: What armor?<br />
<br />
(BTW I type at around 120 WPM so this was happening rather fast but I was making it up on the spot, would have been easier if I'd had it all hotkeyed)<br />
<br />
My Reply:<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yes.. yes indeed.  Come over next to me and I shall share my talent with you.  Now I dont do this for just anyone you see, I have been blessed by the gods with the ability to craft some of the finest armor in all of Norrath, I proudly call it Bloodbane Armor&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Before my friend could type anything else the half elf says:<br />
<br />
&quot;What is bloodbane armor?&quot;<br />
<br />
My reply:<br />
<br />
  &quot;Ahh, you wish to have the famed Bloodbane Armor do you? Well I dont just make it for any lummox you know.  You must prove to me your worth by doing me a favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Half Elf: &quot;what favor?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;So you think you're worthy for the Bloodbane Armor do you? Very well then, travel to Highpass and search out an orc.  Slay this orc and return to me his halberd and we shall talk further.&quot;<br />
<br />
The half-elf leaves and me and my friend sit there and talk for a while, several minutes later he returns and the trade screen pops up.  In plops.. A Shiny Brass Halberd! (my friend asked how he got it so fast after I'd left and he explained he'd had it in the bank)  I quickly hit accept before he could process that it wasn't the NPC trade window, and did the following:<br />
<br />
   &quot;Thank you very much&quot;   then I proceded to walk away.<br />
<br />
A shiny brass halberd really wasn't worth a whole bunch to  me, but I still thought it was funny as all get out. Only regret not being able to see the look on the poor chap's face. Glip the Gnome <br />

This doesn't even come CLOSE, but last week I was roleplaying with my Druid (who, amazingly, is a bit of a troublemaker) and this was during a Q&amp;amp;A session with some idiot Guides. Anyway, I was getting a bit bored, so decided to have some fun, cue auction<br />
<br />
Anarchonium auctions: Those shiny swords the Guides carry. 2pp.<br />
<br />
This was met with some laughs from the people in the audience, but some simple fellows started to give me tells, asking for stats. One particular guy spoke in caps so I decided to have fun with him. I called him over to see the swords, put a dagger in the window, and he promptly replied with 2pp (without checking the stats, or failing to see that it clearly wasn't a sword). Dumbfounded, I clicked Trade, he bowed, and I walked away laughing at his idiocy.<br />
<br />
Wish I'd done it with Dion. A Rogue Gnome would have been so much better at that.<br />
