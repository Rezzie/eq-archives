<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AbatoirRedux</div><div class="date">10-18-02, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently at 60, the Slay Undead paladin has certainly invested a great deal of points into the power given by slay undead. This is a large and meaningful advantage for the paladin, in that it brings him up greatly in situational damage with absolutely no downside. There is nothing inherently wrong with that.<br />
<br />
The issue is that there are no amount of AAs the warrior can buy to also raise his situational damage by such a large amount. This means that before AA, the paladin is always producing somewhat less damage than a warrior; and after AA the paladin is sometimes producing as much damage as a warrior at 60th level. This problem grows more noticeably in margin post 60 and becomes an increasing issue in Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
We've intentionally tried to add more undead creatures to give classes with situational advantages a place to use them. We want people to be able to make use of their anti-undead spell lines, their anti-summoned spells, and of course any specialty AAs. However, the amount of gain given by Slay Undead is too good to have no downside associated with it. Classes need to stay in relative balance with roughly equal AA expenditures.<br />
<br />
We like the idea of this ability from a roleplaying and a gameplay standpoint. But it needs to be altered to make it more balanced. So we’ll be making a change to Slay Undead and refunding the points for this AA ability on Monday.<br />
<br />
NOTE: We’ve also changed the way that the refund works. Unspent AA points over 30 will only be deleted when you first zone after the patch. So you will have time to spend these points after you log in but before you zone.<br />
<br />
We will be changing Slay Undead in two ways.<br />
<br />
The ability will now be activated by a button. You will be able to turn it on and off as you see fit. The drawback is that using this ability requires the attention and intense focus of the Paladin. His intensity leaves him vulnerable to attacks, while inspiring the undead to greater strength. Strikes made against the Paladin using Slay Undead will do more damage than they usually do.<br />
<br />
We wanted to let you know before the change goes Live on Monday.<br />

Im  not even gona go into how absurd this is since its a wholy situational skill with zero boss mob applicans and I'd almost certainly get banned from here.  My views can be found on the rapidly growing Paladin board thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AbatoirRedux</div><div class="date">10-18-02, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because alot of class defining things are being changed, some subtly, some dramaticly.  Things that have been in the game for a considerable period of time are getting nerfed.<br />
<br />
Do you consider backstab a class defining skill for rogues that situationaly can add alot of damage?  How about sneak, is that class defining and situationaly powerful?<br />
<br />
Thought you might want to fight the battle on your neighbors borders before the enemy is at your gates.<br />
<br />
Excercise some forsight, or some sarcasm.  Up to you.<br />

<br />
Yeah, so a paladin can do a 4 - 5K crit vs Arch-Lich...  yay for them!  About time they got some love after being treated like the red-headed stepchild since release.<br />
<br />
I don't have a clue what Pal's are getting come next week (PoP release) but I hope it's REAL good to make up for taking this skill away.<br />

nerfed SU<br />
2.5percent increase in migiation(from PoN board)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fogel Xanedu</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How would you feel if they started nerfing all the good rogue aa's? Oh wait, they did that before aa's were even released</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Inaaki</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats the problem? You just take more damage like a warrior who goes agressive. And its not even on a timer, so cry me a @#%$ river...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DreaDie</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hahahah as if our pallys didn't die enough to undead bosses. We enjoy betting on who the first pally to bite it is gonna be. Bwahah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Banelion</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i dont really understand what they wanted to achieve ... the nerf will have aboslutely no effect ... unless ur tanking the big mob u can go ahead and use it all the time likebefore. So the AL tank if hes a pally cant use it while tanking .... boo hoo ... whole nerf was pointless and after divine stun nerf the only other pally defining skill nerf so now we have no pally defining skills that havent been nerfed ;p lol even LoH was bugged for a bit ;p Although we been powerfull in SoL its in no way unbalancing ... what they gonna do nerf stuns next so they generate no aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_rani</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And for those that didnt bother to read the dev post:<br />
<br />
They arent taking Slay Undead away, it will do the same damage as before. You will be able to turn it on and off. But they will take 15% more damage when its on.<br />
<br />
Thus this is a solo paladin nerf. Raid paladins should be unaffected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_jaguarjp</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It stinks! Paladins SHOULD situationally outdamage Warriors: WHEN that situation involves Undead! If they wanted to alter it, in my opinion they should have just altered it by making it a bit LESS damaging, and not by adding a &quot;downside&quot; to it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Naathan Kaine</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still about 10 more classes that havent had the shoe drop on them yet. Were one of them. Wonder what they have in store for us. Not like we've gotten anything since 2 expansions ago. Hopefully we can ride out the wave without any nerfage. Only thing rogue has gotten in the last 2 years is 16 damage piercers, our AA is rather lack luster with nothing sticking out as a WOW I need to get that skill. But still, It woudnt suprise me if they decided to pick on something we have and nerf it because of XXXX reason.<br />
<br />
P.S- Did anyone see SU as a problem to begin with? I never even heard whispers of this being overpowered.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ennder</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SU = Slay Undead.  Lets paladins get some really nice eye candy crits on undead.  Parses show it raises DPS around 20% for the price of 18 AA against undead only.  This puts us right at warrior DPS.  With this change we probably tank worse than a ranger while using it.  They can claim this nerf is about paladins doing too much dmg but its really about paladins soloing too well, considering the only time we tank is solo generally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mordania</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps this means that there will be a lot of undead in PoP? I assume that this will have the greatest effect on Paladin's that solo or play in small groups without an additional healer.<br />
<br />
About nerfing rogue axp -- to be quite honest there are no really good rogue class skills. They can take them all away for all I care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gilfalas</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a quick correction, Slay Undead has three levels. The cost to get slay undead 3 is a total of 36 AA points.<br />
<br />
36 AA point to allow a Paladin to do damage on undead only equal to a warrior.<br />
<br />
Is that unbalanced? If so wouldn't the fix be to reduce SU damage rather than to hurt the paladins tanking?<br />
<br />
This change is to STRICTLY kill Paladins soloing and being main tanks in XP groups on undead.<br />
<br />
Do nto compare it do disciplines. A) Paldins get none worth a damn and B) Disciplines do not cost 36 AA.<br />
<br />
The Balance of the ability is the cost to get it. If this is wong then fix the cost or scale the damage to be appropriate.<br />
<br />
Nerfing the tanking ability is to nerf Paladins soloing ONLY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ennder</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well 6 of those points are general AA and don't count.  12 are arch type pre-req of combat fury 3, which while not my first choice of AA to max would be one I'd get eventually.  So in reality its only 18 AA.<br />
<br />
However they backed off on the nerf and are fixing it in other ways or at least waiting to see how it effects paladins in PoP before nerfing. Fraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Brashnir</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this nerf has been repealed  Paladins everywhere are rejoicing and partying in the streets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_rejard</div><div class="date">10-21-02, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparantly the outcry was from all classes across the board on this matter. <br />
<br />
Seems like the most common was:<br />
<br />
/feedback You are nerfing paladins? GTFO lol.<br />
<br />
Seriously, thanks to all for the support.<br />
