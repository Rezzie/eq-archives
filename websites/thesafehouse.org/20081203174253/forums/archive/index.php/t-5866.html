I just wanted to tell you a release date of the General Vghara (lvl 63+ SK) in Kithior Forest.<br />
Meeting Point: Front of RV<br />
Date: Friday 24th, August<br />
Time: at 12 AM pst (21.00 Uhr for the german players) <br />
Any Rogue that need to kill the general is heartly welcomed(but be sure to bring the spawning Item with you)<br />
Therefore I organize the raid, I only want the first general pouch + caziq quill dropped. (If he drops at least any caziq quill)<br />
<br />
For the spoiler of the rogue Epic and some hints about defeating the general I prefer reading this link:<br />

<br />
Hope to see much of you in Kithior and many many thanks.<br />

 Yahooooo, let the game begin.</div></div><hr />

I think you need to reconsider .. if you spawn the general anything on it is yours .. and if it depop's its your box lost .. if someone else spawns the general and quill drops .. its theirs.  .. But thats just what I think if you can get rogues to come along with those terms then all the bets to ya.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dikus</div><div class="date">08-21-01, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a huge raiding party right now... And for all the lightie rogues with a smaller guild or without a guild I offer to receive the generals pouch if you can spawn the general.<br />
But therefore they don´t have anything to do, I prefer if cazic quill is dropped it goes to the organizer... Still then much easier for the rogue to quest/multiquest this cazic quill thing. Hey and don´t forget I am a true hearted rogue, nothing on this world is for free without death...<br />
<br />
Ah and of course all loot not needed for quest surely will be rolled to all players out there... <br />
<br />
Come or leave, your decision...<br />
I only offer a debt in killing the general<br />
<br />
And for the meeting time I made a mistake someone told me,<br />
not 12 am its more 0.01 PM ;-) Yahooooo, let the game begin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Der Elf</div><div class="date">08-22-01, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think its more than fair to allow rogues who don't belong to guilds capable of killing V'Ghera the chance to do their epic quest traditionally.  It's not as if he's cheating anyone nor giving anyone else an item at another's expense.  And its not like the Cazic Quill is ONLY obtainable via a random drop from V'Ghera.  <br />
<br />
If anything, he's providing the services of his guild to others on an unlikely gamble that the Cazic Quill will drop at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Stytch Yapgud</div><div class="date">08-22-01, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His raid his rules. You dont have to go.<br />
<br />
Course Im nowhere near that end of the game so I might be wrong.<br />
<br />
But it seems fair to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ewan aka nach0king</div><div class="date">08-23-01, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, spot on. Don't like the rules? Don't go.<br />
<br />
As it happens I think those rules are perfectly fair, anyway.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tifftif</div><div class="date">08-30-01, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd gladly have done that.  Rogues who aren't in a guild, or in a small one incapable of taking the general, that's a great chance for it.  Farming phinny or the dark elves is a heck of a lot easier than trying to organize a general raid.  I'd have gladly offered my quill to someone who killed the general for me (or organized a raid that did, rather).</div></div><hr />
