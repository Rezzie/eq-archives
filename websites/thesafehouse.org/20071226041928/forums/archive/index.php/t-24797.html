Just kidding. It's the most horrible anime I've ever seen. Anyone make it past 9 minutes? I kept checking to make sure it was almost over. After the fifth check, I realized it waqsn't even halfway through and gave up.<br />

Good god. That guy gives Steven Segal a run for his money for monotone face. I keep reading that the Director of the anime, Monkey Punch, is actually serious about this show, where everyone else thinks of it as one big joke. It's not bad in a Sousei no Aquarion way, it's just... bad.</div></div><hr />
