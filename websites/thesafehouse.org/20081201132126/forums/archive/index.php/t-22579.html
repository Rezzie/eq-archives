It appears that the Sigil folks aren't really as blue as we may have been led to believe. In fact, I understand that Jeff Butler is actually quite an avid PeeKay, and the Director of Business Dev regaled us with tales of their roleplay-PvP guild. Lady Daegarmo, one of the more prominent Zek GMs is now with Sigil, and I hear the Sigil team holds quite a few folks who like to mix it up.  Judging by a show of hands at Fanguard, the playerbase will as well.  <br />

There will definitely be at least one PvP server at launch, and more to follow. The ruleset is not determined yet, but each server will likely have different rulesets. Wide open, Race, Realm, and Faction were all cited by Brad as likely variations. Given that the Diplomacy sphere is intended to be a significant component of the game on the order of combat itself, I think that a Faction based server may be the most intriguing, though a Race War server would make it a difficult choice. The game has been designed with differing rulesets in mind, and so that PvP and PvE can be tuned independently.</div></div><hr />
