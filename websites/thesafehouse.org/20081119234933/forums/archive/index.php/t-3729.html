I've lead a raid force of about 40 for this and it took nearly 5 hrs.  Any well established strategies?  <br />

Thanks<br />

Kill Caprin, clear to Avhi, kill Avhi, kill Bishop, pull Raex + Vindor, kill HP?<br />
<br />
Which part is taking so long?</div></div><hr />

With the near constant 5k taps, he just mowed through people. Ran over our 8800hp tank and didn't even stop moving. I can think of anything really, but other than runes/spellshields is there anything you can do to make the fight even a little bit easier? Pure zerg just sucks.</div></div><hr />

Any help on the skeleton factory part? (aka Ahvi)<br />
<br />
Seem to get retarded aggro or just rampage issues, healers get summoned, skeletons galore lol. Even victories end up in wipes and recoveries to finish the cycle.<br />
<br />
I get a kick out of a million skeleton march, but apparently my guildies don't</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sarai of Grove</div><div class="date">11-20-03, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahvi is permarooted, it makes building agro against him easy.  Set up in the room before Ahvi and have your puller take the skeleton guards that are currently with him to the raid and MEZ them.  If the skeletons are killed, they will just split, so they must be mezed and held for the duration of the fight (they can be safely killed after Ahvi is dead).  Ahvi rampages so make sure no clerics heal your pullers, no buff songs are going, etc.  Have your main tank and rampage tanks go forward and start plinking Ahvi with arrows for a couple minutes till they have solid agro.  Then start your CH rotation on your MT (have some druids or alt healers watching the ramp tank).  I believe we use a 3 second rotation using an 8k HP tank but that may be overkill.  Ahvi should die pretty rapidly, after he's dead, have the raid back up to the previous room where the skeletons are mezed and kill.  Move into Ahvi's room and prepare for the next stage.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

Never heard of this, we kill everything in her room, including her 4 pet skellies, then engage her.  The key is not having anyone die, not mezzing the skeletons through the duration of the fight, the skeletons dont split  , 4 more appear for each person/pet that dies</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't done this in months, but I've never seen anything like that. No mobs split when killed in CoD. Just pull the skeletons, kill them and then kill Avhi. <br />
<br />
Heal the MT and RT, don't have retards die to enrage or steal aggro, and don't use any pets on it. Pets dying cause skeleton adds just like a player dying does. If you can't control aggro on this, good luck with Tallon Zek in RZ script in the future. This guy doesn't even slow or debuff the MT like TZ does, so he's a lot easier to control aggro on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll tell you :<br />
Each time a player ou a pet die, a skelleton pop. Basically, try to avoid pets, swarm pets, cleric hammers, wiz swords...<br />
<br />
For the lifetaps, 500 MR help for resist or partial resists. have one or two wizards chain cast spell shield on your best tank, especially for Raex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dagny Blazestorm</div><div class="date">11-20-03, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also you might want to look into setting rampage on Raex unless you want 1 cleric dying per ramp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Clear his room.<br />
2. Debuff.<br />
3. Mem blur.<br />
4. Set rampage.<br />
5. MT and RT go.<br />
6. Wait a few extra seconds for agro.<br />
7. Raid goes. No pets!  No FD!<br />
8. Watch agro!<br />
<br />
If anyone besides RT gets on rampage, they should step back out of range.<br />
<br />
Also,<br />
Clear entire area before engaging Bishop (also perma-rooted).  After Bishop send raid back upstairs.  Use an SK or a pair of monks to split the next 2 named.  Or, if your raid is strong enough, assign a Tank to each and charge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
or tell the raid to take a 5 min break and when everyone gets back, the two will have wandered off into separate rooms, easy for singling</div></div><hr />

<br />
Avoid death = adequately heal people and have alert people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sildir</div><div class="date">11-20-03, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way to do the skele spawn guy is to just do it like a ranged fight. He doesn't have much hp so it doesn't really matter all that much that your mellee aren't doin anything. Not really necessary if people watch agro, but I have yet to see the ranged method fail *shrug*<br />
<br />
On the 5k lifetappers get MR up and/or chain rune.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Walish</div><div class="date">11-21-03, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fastest we have ever done the carprin cycle was 1hour from zonein to completion.<br />
<br />
Carprin:<br />
Make sure you get his 3 pets without carprin, once the last dies carprin warps down on corpse - generally just have people use assisthealing, as carprin memblurs self - and then just have all your tanks taunting..<br />
<br />
Avhi:<br />
Skellie hordes are fun.... but not all the time.<br />
Clearing the room is easy, and the person doing so will most likely get on rampage - use this - have a sk pull the room, since Avhi is rooted its no problem.<br />
On engage make sure all your healers spamheal MT - have 2 healers assigned for rampage tank - and just have people NOT use pets or FD - fd WILL spawn skellies, so will pets that despawn (like wizzy swords or cleric hammers).<br />
<br />
Bishop:<br />
Rooted and right through easy - have a mt, have people watch his health and their agro - then just kill him.<br />
<br />
Vindor and Raex:<br />
Vindor is slowable, tank with high resists and lots of healing, and just burn him down...<br />
Raex - we do this guy in a fun fun way! - we sacrifice rangers, pull him in - have a chain of rangers set up, they fire weaponshield and then just keep snaring the guy till they die.... thats 18secs per ranger approximate - have everyone do all their dmg - even clerics nuking, and he goes down and you loose 5-7ish peeps.<br />
<br />
HighPriest:<br />
Have someone ready to cure MT from the slow - and else just watch agro, he is easykill<br />

<br />
(chuckles) Tell that to the monk pulling who FD while everyone was still in the back room.<br />
<br />
Most skellies spawned?  The last time I actually counted them with track was 96    And talk about video/game lag.  Hehe, people were dying simply because they could not even move to escape.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 5k lifetap fights are always nasty, chain spellshield, stick mts with bards, use enc charm pets...DI, and the new spell absorb. ldon spell should work aswell..</div></div><hr />
