<br />
I've always, always preferred to be a player.  I not sure why exactly; maybe it's the immersion factor, where you can picture yourself (your character) in his or her role in the setting.<br />
<br />
I don't like knowing everything that's going to happen. I would rather take part in the story, rather than have full knowledge of the story from the very start.<br />
<br />
In my current group, I am stuck as a DM, GM, whatever, depending on what game we play.  It's not what I really want to do, but it's the only way I get to RPG anymore.  I'm a terrible, terrible DM   - I admit it.  I'm the kind of DM that makes up the adventure on the spot; the only pre-planning done is &quot;Hey, I bet the player will think this'll be nifty.&quot;  <br />
<br />
All you DMs with your detailed jorunals, notes, maps, etc...you impress the heck out of me.  That's a hell of alot of work for a game.    But, if it works for you, go with it.</div></div><hr />

DMs have a lot of work to do to run a decent game, and it'd just bug me to death if I felt uninspired for new material.</div></div><hr />

My campaigns tend to bend the rules a lot, and they play out like an action movie, although with a very developed plot.  I also interject tons of comic relief.  They lean towards melee with only a little empasis on magic.  They tend to be present day campaigns.   <br />
My friend Troy's campaigns follow the rules more closely, and most often take place in the future, but other than that our campaign styles are the same.  <br />
Nelson, the other guy who DM's tends to underestimate the players a lot, so we kill his most badass villain earlier than expected, but he has a good way of painting vivid backrounds, better than me or troy.  His campaigns tend to take place in the D&amp;amp;D setting and are heavily reliant on magic.<br />
<br />
Sometimes we all have campaigns going.  Anyway, I like to DM and to be a player. <br />

So many reasons, but most importantly to me, I'm just not hard enough to push players at all.  <br />

<br />
I set up the situation, the NPCs and their motives and let it flow. The PCs do what they want... and rarely do they not surprise me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I meant in the 'Grand Scheme' of things.  In other words, I know the story - it has a begining, middle, and end.  PCs are of course free to get there however the want.<br />
<br />
I guess a better analogy would be to reading a novel.  To me, Gm-ing is like reading the last chapter of a novel before you hit the prologue.  Sure, you'll enjoy the story, but there's no surprise or kicker at then end.<br />
<br />
I like the sensation of being a player.  The PC's are heroes, but they're still little fish in a bigger pond.</div></div><hr />

I have DM'd and played.  I love playing because i like being a character and doing 'character things'.  I am a great role player, but role playing only goes so far if your fellow characters aren't into it.<br />
<br />
But then i love being a DM because i can create and mold and 'play' many characters.  Most of my DM sessions haven't been as fun as i would like, mostly because my players were morons.  <br />
<br />
I want to play a campaign some time with an 'elite role player' group that take the game seriously (but not too seriously).<br />
<br />
Being a DM really affirms that people mainly think about nothing but sex.  &quot;Are there any girls in the tavern?&quot; :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, it's a less sting to lose a char when casualty rate of PCs is high. Only time I've gotten really pissed is when I'd just finished rolling up a new char, not a short task with the house rules, and he died in 5 minutes. If yer gonna kill off a lot of PCs it's just good form to make people roll up new ones between or before the session. Nothing is as irritating as spending majority of the session rolling up a char while others get to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">03-05-02, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">about half and half.<br />
<br />
When I GM I tend to generate NPCs and a dilemma (or three or five) then interject the players into it and let them decide what to do and how to do it.  It takes a good deal of making NPCs with individual motivations and personalities to make it work, and more work to set up a somewhat complex political web that provides lots of gray areas and intrigues.  I don't like to run campaigns where the PCs are the toughest or most important people in the world or even in the local area.  Having the PCs be largely immune to being killed is a bad idea as it promotes them to hold themselves hostage, ie do foolhardy and stupid things, knowing the GM will not kill them for it.  Conversely, they shouldn't be too vulnerable (if not revivifiable) as that prevents the players from identifying/caring about their character.  Its a balancing act.<br />
<br />
As a player there is a lot less to keep track of, so if i am in the mood for more relaxation, its great.</div></div><hr />
