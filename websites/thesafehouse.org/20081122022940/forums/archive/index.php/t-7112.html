<br />
I remember hearing somewhere that a Brell-worshipping rogue can go deep into the Hole - and I created one and made a few tries.<br />
<br />
I got whacked. Or I got lost, then I got whacked.<br />
<br />
I had the druid camo and sow me and made a dash, but got really turned around (the EQ Atlas map is pretty small)<br />
<br />
anyone have ideas on what I can do to get my corpse back?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Anzei</div><div class="date">11-02-02, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did it with a level 1 rogue. He could go partway without any buffs - so I sow'ed and camoed him and ran around until I found the corpse - it took a few relays to get it back up top, but I got to explore a LOT of the Hole that way.<br />
<br />
I could try some suicide stunts with the level 1 toon that I'd never think of trying with a more developed character -- like &quot;can I jump off from the top and still hit the water&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
With innate Sneak and Hide both starting above normal newbie stats, getting ANYWHERE in the Hole is just a matter of time.  The mobs that do see through Sneak/Hide won't attack you - even the Flighty Fiends who Scowl right through Sneak/Hide will let you pass.<br />
<br />
Even Brell worshipers are KoS to Ghosts and Ratmen, making a normal invis run near impossible.<br />
<br />
Edit: For a permanent CR solution for those of you raiding/hunting in the Hole, have your hafling bound on top of the zone in.  This lets you get corpses back to the top by suiciding once they are at the drop-off point.  Halflings also have no problems working through the crack in the rock blocking the zone line.

Seemed to work pretty well for the few CRs I've used him for.  I've never been attacked, even when right up on top of a mob that still 'scowls'.  <br />
<br />
Biggest drawback though is the lack of SoW since he's parked below the gap.  But I do have him bound right up in Paineel, which means I just die, get zapped back to the outside, get a SoW, and head back in again without losing equipment since he's still &amp;lt;10.  Kinda handy, really.<br />
