<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what it is, but yesterday I did a few groups with 1-3 ppl max.<br />
<br />
Everything went to much better.  On indoor missions there would be solo boss  mobs or reasonable amounts of mobs instead of 500mobs every 5 feet.  I was raking in higher avg's on exp and influence and easily knocked out 4 indoor missions.<br />
  <br />
I also logged in with 72 influence and logged out with close to 17k.  I guess the big groups get so out of control that even though you are killing stuff it isn't as efficent or something.  <br />
<br />
I also saw a post by some FoH dude(yea they play on our server to) who noticed the same thing.  <br />
<br />
Is it just the suck ass quality of zerg groups that are doomed to fail or is it better to tackle the game on with a small group of friends?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matheren</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed the same thing throughout beta. unless you have a *very* good group of friends (and it helps to have a balanced group of classes on top of that), then a 7-8 person group is quite often suicidal. the mission difficulty scales rather steeply. you're fighting more mobs, which are tougher against you, which you can't hit as often.<br />
<br />
anymore, I won't play the game unless I have friends on to group with. I'm a mind controller, and it's a total waste of my time to group with five or six idiots that throw area attacks around and attack every mob on the field, thus breaking my mez powers constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd agree. I'd say 3-6 is optimal, IMHO.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm in a 4 person regular group with my guild, and it works beautifully. I've been in 8 person groups in PP and stuf, and it seems like A) Its so damned disorganized and B) Theres too much looking for stuff to kill, and not enough killing.<br />
<br />
Plus, In a 7-8 person group, It seems like the only part of the game I see are the teeny tiny health bars on the left side of the screen, because I can't afford to take my eyes off them for a second. Its not so bad with 4 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, a group of three or four seems optimal for door missions. Any more than that and it just gets confusing.<br />
<br />
It seems almost like content is designed for six, but the group limit is 8 &quot;just in case&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a lot different than the EQ mindset, where Adding more people always makes it easier.<br />
<br />
Well, unless you add a Ranger to a 5 person group... then it makes the Cleric's life hell. But other than that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In the first Intersection of the map, I could see TEN bosses in my sight range just by turning 360.<br />

yick.</div></div><hr />
