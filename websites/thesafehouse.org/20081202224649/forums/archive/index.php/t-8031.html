<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikus</div><div class="date">10-02-02, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiho all,<br />
<br />
I posted my Idea already elsewhere under another thread which got hijacked then because of this, so I decide to post this here in the hope you other Rogues like my Idea and then<br />
we could Verant push to implement it.<br />
<br />
Facts before:<br />
- Verant is unable to make Poisons stackable of coding<br />
- Poisons ingredients are rare drops and have mostly to be farmed. <br />
- Poison Mastery is a skill which nearly none of the existing rogues spent their hard earned AA Exps into.<br />
- Pre-PoP Poisons are instant check at first hit, PoP Poisons are Proc-Buff based.<br />
<br />
My Solution to get Verant with some single little programming out of the disaster:<br />
Give us a 4-place-bag where you can store 4 Poisons inside.<br />
These Poisons wont used up when you then poison your weapon inside it with one of these.<br />
It could be a lvl 51+ quest or a AA exp skill. ( See the relationship to rangers „Fleeting Quiver“ ?   )<br />
<br />
What you achieve with it:<br />
- Poisons have still to be farmed but are now once you farmed and able to make it, you will never lose it. (like a miniquest)<br />
- Poisons remain unstackable<br />
- Poison Mastery especially with lowering the delay of the apply would now be worthwile too.<br />
- Bazaar would now offering rare Poisons to sell too for other Rogues who hasnt the making skill (but are able to apply).<br />
<br />
Please post your comments about my Idea and if you like it and are in any relationship to Verants EQ-Ideas-Service tell it to them.<br />
<br />
PS.: I am still waiting for a SH Warder because of my application  <br />

if they did it with the potions, don't think it would be hard with poisons. and that would make the poisons a bit more interresting too, imo</div></div><hr />

The Idea you posted has been offered to Verant since they introduce Shaman Potions stacking.<br />
<br />
But they already declared it would be impossible for them to use this coding for Poisons also because they aren´t a spell.<br />
<br />
Just a question to you: You do understand what I meant with my (pitiful) english above ? <br />
If you have these Poison bag you would never loose the Poison inside it when you use it. Just rightclick one of it to apply.<br />
<br />
So there is no need either for stackable potions.<br />
<br />
Rangers have a fleeting quiver where they can put Arrows.<br />
A Arrow used from this bag will never consumed by firing it.<br />
It is unlimited! <br />
<br />
It would be easy achieving this with coding this for poisons too imo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bladesake</div><div class="date">10-02-02, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about just giving us the skill apply poison on a button so that we dont have to take them out a bag, right click, and sit down for a few seconds and apply? That way we could just arrange them in order in our inventory and press the button to apply poisons one by one without all the item swapping. Can even set up combos like blind/snare to be applied order automatically. And maybe even have it to where you automatically stand up after applying the poison like you do while binding wounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Restyn</div><div class="date">10-02-02, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, you can do Apply Poison as a button. Hotkey an open inventory slot. Place a poison vial in that slot. Not simply hit the hotkey and you will Apply.<br />
<br />
As for the suggestion, I’m torn. While it’s a novel approach to the matter, unlimited poisons means we are like spell casters, but without the mana. Also, I would think the coding for an arrow would be different than poison, so it might still cause troubles. If you want something in the higher range like that though, how about that Poison Mastery gives you a chance of NOT comsuming the poison? This way you could feasibly use the same poison vial over and over, but technically not forever.<br />
<br />
The more I think about it, the more I am liking the idea of this “buff” poison. If those go in to affect, they would be similar to a one shot Shaman potion, and I’ve got no problem with that. Plus, it makes DEX more useful.<br />
<br />
I still want to see some Smithing recipes that use poison as ingredients, but hey, a man can dream eh?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mugwump C</div><div class="date">10-04-02, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i did understand your point, Dikus, but there is a difference between making poison stackable and having one poison that you don't consume at all..<br />
first there are already only a few rogues training they poison skill and having an endless poison wouldn't encourage people to train it.<br />
also, some poisons make a lot of dmg.. i guess with poison mastery it musn't take long to apply, so a rogue would apply mind melt, get up, hit, bs, apply, hit bs, etc.. for ever..<br />
and then i'm for an aa that gives us something equivalent of the endless quiver for throwing weapons, so we need only one throwing that doesn't consume.<br />
my point was that a poison that doesn't consume seems to be a lill too powerfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">10-04-02, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">make poisons injectable, so they can not be dispelled at all, would be cool to slap a neg resistance poison and a neg dex poison on AL and let it stick till it wears off, he chain dispells so no one else can use spells on him, and the poisons won't trivialize the fight and have him dead much earlier or easier<br />
<br />
anyways make poisons 'injected' so nothing can dispell them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rulek</div><div class="date">10-05-02, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that if VI wanted to they could make a bag like the shamans to make a 5-10 shot poison. It can't be that hard. Lugging around 5 or 6 poisons of 3 or 4 different types each is such a pain in the a.s.s.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_feck opression</div><div class="date">10-11-02, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If these new poisons are just one shot per vial its just a waste of time AGAIN! If we dont get some sort of endless charged poisons we at least should have em with like a 100 charges on them, or make each application require a reagent that is BUYABLE.  Would be nice if someone would realize that there are enough time sinks in this game for us, and not add more just to fully function as your class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jagsnor Dinapengar</div><div class="date">10-13-02, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that our poisons are spells (Imbue proc buff) there is no limitation in the engine for making them 'stackable' anymore. A 'stack' of say 10 poisons would be the same as one vial with 10 charges of the imbue buff.<br />
<br />
If they really want us to use poison they need to give us an AA skill similar to Endless Quiver but for poison, as well as making the poison 'stackable' as per above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rune the Borrower</div><div class="date">10-13-02, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO, as long as the green farming isn't rediculous an unlimited charge poison wouldn't be needed. Given a REASONABLE drop rate, I wouldn't mind it at all. Spending an hour farming for 6 to 7 hours of poisoning ability seems appropriate. As it is now however you can spend 6 to 7 hours farming and get only 2 or 3 instanly consumed poisons.<br />
<br />
Stacking to 100 is a bit excessive I think. Given an average of 12 min an application a stack of 20 would allow for 4 hours of procs. Since a &quot;raid&quot; seldom is 4 hours long you can be poison buffed for the entire raid and only devote ONE inventory slot to it. For the exp grind you might need 2 slots but half way through you've freed up one of them.<br />
<br />
Hasn't that been the complaint about single charge vials from the start? The fact that they take up so much inventory space? <br />
