<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know what, I'm gonna get on a soapbox here and complain about something else about SWG that pisses me off.  Since its topical.<br />
<br />
I hate with a passion that PvP in SWG isn't totally optional.  You know why?  Cause there is alot, and I mean ALOT that you can't do if you don't PvP.  Like faction pets(i.e. having your own stormtroopers or the awsome AT-ST).  Stormtrooper armor.  And cool bases for your guild.  All great stuff, but its total @#%$ that you can't use any of it unless you open yourself up to PvPer.<br />
<br />
What really steams me is the way they say, 'PvP is totally consensual!&quot;  Suck my ass!  PvP in SWG is consensual in the way that, if this were EQ, imagine playing a Mage and not being able to summon an elemental unless you handed in your Discord book.<br />
<br />
Cause thats pretty much the situation.  Players who PvP have access to a wide variety of things that don't just benefit them in PvP.  All those pets and other cool gear are just denied you.<br />
<br />
They had a great idea, have covert and over factions.  If you were over, you were PvP all the time.  If you were covert, its pretty much the same, you roleplay your faction, you rank up, you gain the benefits of being an imperial or a rebel without worrying about having your fun ruined by some griefing douchbag.  Or worse yet, having hours of faction work blown away in an instant by some @#%$ with a flamethrower when they set your walker on fire then run away while it continues to burn with no way to stop it.<br />
<br />
But then they @#%$ it up by making all the important stuff unavailable unless you subject yourself to the asstastic time above.  They disable the pets ect unless you go overt!  Its totally @#%$!<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind so much if the things you get awarded for going overt were only usable for PvP.  But tell me why the asses that go PvP should have a much easier time SOLOING than me because they can use the big bad walker and I can't??<br />
<br />
Its just all @#%$ falling apart man.  @#%$ Christ on a cracker. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />

It has a few nicely done features, like the resources and trade systems, but as a game it sucks to an amazing degree. Imo the best and most innovative MMO to come out since EQ is Shadowbane, it's the only game since that did PvP just right. It's also a commercial failiure if you match it up to AO/SWG/DAoC/Whatever. I've pretty much lost faith in the genre since I had burned out on EQ.</div></div><hr />

Came in the &quot;After Dark&quot; pack?  You played an anti-virus spaceship and you flew through your directory structure collecting files that were actual names on your harddrive.  It also had little virii in the folders that you had to shoot.<br />
<br />
Was rather entertaining.  Much more entertaining than SWG at this point.  At least to me.<br />
When I was crafting up the tree towards Master Tailor it kept my intrest.  But once I hit it the intrest only stayed for about 3 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crist people, did anyone even finish reading the post.<br />
<br />
As I said, I wanna play the PvE game.  So if people who PvPed could, say, only use thier pets in PvP, I wouldn't care.  PvP leads to new PvP rewards.  I can live with that.  But PvPer get alot of really cool @#%$ that makes PvE easier!  I play PvE!  If you can use @#%$ walkers to do your @#%$ bounty hunter missions than I want to be able to also!  I earned just as much faction as you did!<br />
<br />
Quote:&quot;Why can't I be a covert agent and be followed by a platoon of Stormtroopers and an ATAT!&quot;? Seriously.. that's just dumb. <br />
<br />
No, its not, because covert and overt have nothing to due with actually roleplaying, they are just words SoE came up with to seperate PvPers and non-PvPers who want to play a faction.<br />
<br />
Quote:PvP isn't forced on anyone. You can be covert.<br />
<br />
Yeah sure, if I want to deprive myself of the best upgrades in the game I can be covert.  Thats just @#%$.  Like I said, its like if you were playing a mage or necromancer in EQ and you couldn't summon your pet unless you hand in your Book of Discord.  Yeah, TECHNICALLY PvP is optional, but your increadibly underpowered compared to players who do PvP even when they aren't PvPing.  they can do solo missions better than you.  They can complete quests better than you.  They can do everything better than you.  And all because they play PvP.  Optional my @#%$ ass.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LiquidXIR</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty easy to avoid all that stuff. When your off hunting find a recruiter and switch over to Overt so you can use all the lewty gear, when your done for the night go back and set to covert or die and have it automatically set back, not like the penalties are severe. <br />
<br />
Take Dantooine for example, on Scylla, if you don't feel safe going overt on that planet NOWHERE will you be able to go overt, you're surrounded by people with ATST and the NPC ATST, it's a safe as they can come. If you're on a big rebel planet without support, don't pull out the personnel, simple as that...out in the field are what there for anyway unless you really want to take the chance with using them in PVP anyway. I think I've lost ONE trooper total due to being ambushed carelessly on Bestine, which on my server is about as safe as wearing an Imperial bulls-eye that says &quot;I'm a raid target, shoot me.&quot; That's it...just takes smarts on where you use them.</div></div><hr />

You know you can wear full stormtrooper as a covert? wear ST armor as a rebel? Those things piss me off more then not having the best of both worlds, i think the whole covert/overt system is one hte few things they got right. Just gotta be careful who you heal....healed a guy in bestine, ran out of the med center and 2 rebels, master gunfighter and a master CH, were there to greet me wth my overt tef...heh. Imo there are more pressing issues then this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP is the only thing that gives me pleasure in that game.  But since I am alien Imp, I have no chance of saving up for an AT-st(18k faction) and buying faction is to expensive(2 million credits).<br />
<br />
There are alot of problems with the game that can drive a person crazy, pvp is just a part of it.PvP creates so many balance issues it isn't even funny.(I am melee and consistently get out of range messages at 2 meters when fighting)  There are alot of far off places with recruiters you can fight safely if you really want to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
But adding to this rant. <br />
The Jedi @#%$ is so @#%$ wack.<br />
More info has come out. <br />
You have to atleast master 4 different classes.<br />
Thats right. Zero quest or storyline.<br />
Camp for a rare drop that can take about to a RL week(sound familiar?) Compete with THOUSANDS of others for the same drop further reducing your odds.<br />
Once you get the drop, you must then decide what part of your character skill set you want to totally drop.<br />
Then hope you have the money &amp; resources to master another class.<br />
Finish that class.<br />
Then camp another rare drop.  Drop another class which is most likely the one you just spend 4-8 weeks working to master. Master the next class.<br />
Camp drop again, master another class.<br />
Camp drop again, master another class.<br />
After that the rest remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
Either way, its totally @#%$ lame. You can't power level in this game, your character can only use certain weapons depending on the skill, so even with major buffs your damage output wont increase.<br />
<br />
If you have a non combat class, no choice but to sit in front of a crafting station for hours and make things.(artisian requires alteast 1 million credits to master). Woe unto if the class you choose doesn't have a way to make 100k a night, gonna to be a long haul.<br />
<br />
Typical SOE.  <br />
Instead of addressing the problem and adding in a new fix, they just throw together old code and call it something new.<br />

<br />
Well its nice to see even PvPers admit that PvP sucks and its a panalty you have to endure to get lewt PvE rewards.<br />
<br />
I have not played SWG, but they again I knew it read PvP on the packaging. I totally agree, that having PvP in any way affect PvE, makes it a PvP game for everyone. Let PvP gain titles, and leaderboard status, and special PvP weapons, I dont care, but make the the same ot preferbly worse at PvE, since they suck up tons of development resources that I have to pay for as well.<br />
<br />
Well I guess I can opt out of paying by not buying the game. Sounds like a good plan, ill stick to that   Ishwar - level 65 Barbarian Rogue - GM smith</div></div><hr />

Yes, I know what it is you're so unhappy about. You want the benefits of having PvP toys as a purely PvE player. You bitch that PvP players can use them even when they PvE, so that makes it unfair for you. What you overlook is the fact that even while they're trying to just PvE, overt ops are subject to being PvP jumped all the time. Risk, reward. It's simple. (Ignoring a moment what other people have already told you, that it's not even hard to get around.) <br />
<br />
You want all of the phat lewtz and to just skip the danger. It's still dumb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I don't think not wanting to get one-shot-killed all the time is being bitchy.  Its about not wanting to do PvP in another game where SoE couldn't even get melee balance to come close.<br />
<br />
You get shot by a commando, your dead.  Period.  Same deal with the bounty hunter lightning cannon.  Sure, you can get the unstoppable AT-ST, and they just set it on fire and run away.  You can't put out the fire, and you can't heal the walker so you just get to stand there while like 2 million creds worth of faction burns to the ground.  Master Combat medics will chuck grenades that will cause your whole party to lose all their health or action to WOUNDS, ie, the kind you have to go to the med center to heal.  And, again, it will keep dealing out wounds long after you are dead.<br />
<br />
I think thats one of the big problems right there.  DoTs keep on killing your ass even if you kill the guy who dotted you.  And they last FOREVER in this game.  Unless you have a doctor handy, you are going to get KO'ed by any kind of dot you get hit with.  Which leads into the main reason I hate being forced to PvP...ALL OTHER PEOPLE ARE @#%$!...commando's and combat medics will happily kamikaze themselves to disease you...all your pets...or set your whole party on fire.  Either one is certain death.  Combat medic means you'll be buying all new stormtroopers and you'll be in the medic center for the next hour.  Commando means you'll be buying new walkers.  And they don't give a @#%$!  They lose a couple points of faction when you turn around an kill them.  They don't even take their pets out, so they lost NOTHING!  They don't lose a weeks worth of factioning, flushed down the toilet in a single instant.<br />

Thats good fun right there.<br />
,<br />
I can only hope that when vehicles go in that they add some kinda profession that repairs vehicals, and the ability to heal walker pets is including.  Actually, I think that building that seems to be included in all the starting cities, you know the one, the one with the ramp that leads to what looks like 2 garages with force fields for doors, I think that will be some kinda machine shop.  Like a Cantina/med center for your mechanicals.<br />
