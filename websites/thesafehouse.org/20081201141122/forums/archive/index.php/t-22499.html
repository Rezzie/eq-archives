<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">01-24-06, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today I went to the store looking for GitS:SAC 2nd Gig Vol. 3, and previously I had told myself that even though I do have a home theater capable of DTS I was only going to buy the regular versions of 2nd Gig, not the special editions (which includes a DTS version as well as some cool extras; last year I got three T-shirts and a couple CDs from the Special Editions).<br />
<br />
So I get to Futureshop, ready to buy both Volume 3 of 2ng Gig and the Official Log 2 for the first season.  I can't find the Log 2, but when I take a look at the new releases I see both the regular version and special edition of the DVD I want.  Curious as to what separates the two versions (aside from $17cdn extra for the SE) I picked up the SE and read the back.<br />
<br />
The Special Edition comes with the DTS disc in addition to the regular disc, both in a nice metal tin case, but it also came with two figurines, one of Major Motoko Kusanagi and one of a Tachikoma.  I ended up buying the Special Edition for the figurines, though with the size of the box I figured they would be about the size of the small heroclix figure I got with my copy of City of Villains; I was wrong.<br />
<br />
I got home and opened the box to find each model consisted of several pieces to be assembled, and the Major stands in at just over 3 1/4&quot; high.  The Tachikoma is smaller in height, but still a nice sized model and both have good detail.  Below is an uploaded pic of the two models:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm waiting on the GitS2:Innocence Special Edition to come out, since the only thing I've seen is a normal edition.</div></div><hr />

The series is a little on the...complicated side for me (seem to spend a lot fo time on techno- and politibabble), but I do enjoy it.  Is it just me, or does that one blond terrorist guy whose picture keeps popping up (no name yet, at least on the Adult Swim runs I've been watching) look an awful lot like Liquid Snake?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, those were released in Japan as a three figure set while it was still airing in Japan. I don't know if they plan to include it in the future, but that's why there are three portions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulstealer</div><div class="date">01-24-06, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i had to watch SAC twice to get the whole story....   there are allot of side tracks that really dont play in the main story at all.  I dig the little models though they are cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-24-06, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must be used to complicated shows because I watched this subbed and I still got it all.<br />
<br />
Also, they tell you which episodes are part of the primary storyline and which aren't on the screen that shows the title of the episode.  I forget what they call them during 2nd gig, but in season 1, the oneshot episodes say &quot;stand alone episode&quot; and the main storylines say &quot;complex episode&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Btw, I absolutely love both seasons of SAC.  It's easily my favorite non-shonen anime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulstealer</div><div class="date">01-24-06, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well FF through the opening right to the show start would explain missing all that...:roll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">01-25-06, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually rarely fast forward through the start of an anime, as the good ones tend to have an opening theme song which helps to put me in the mood for the show.  They're usually only about a minute and a half, anyways.<br />
<br />
Both seasons of GitS have a good opening song, as does the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Rune Soldier, Elfen Lied, and Gunslinger Girl to mention a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-25-06, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both seasons of GitS have GREAT opening songs.  They have great music within the episodes as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">01-25-06, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I loved those figures.  Expecially the tank. :D<br />
You know the pod of the tank can open too to reveal a seat and controls. <br />
My only issue with the Major's figure was her hands, as you can see in the pic the off hand dosnt quite line up with the gun hand.  I got mine pushed around so it does but it makes abit of a seam visible at the sleeves.<br />
<br />
As for intros.  I typically watch the intro and ending for the first episode then I dont watch them many more.  But GitS into I LOVE the song so I end up watching it just about every episode.  Only times I dont is when I really want to see what happens next.<br />
<br />
Theres a few others that ive watched the intro more than once but typically I only want them once.  More intrested in the new material of the show then watching the same intro 26 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">01-25-06, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With regards to the Major's hand, I don't think it's supposed to be grabbing at the gun, as with a weapon down that low a person would be jamming their forearm into their thigh to hold on with both hands.  The off hand seems to be just 'following' the gun until it needs to be used, ready to brace it just before it's fired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">01-25-06, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, I guess I could see that...<br />
But when I pushed it under the other hand it was a good fit.  Like her off hand is supporting the butt of the pistol.<br />
<br />
Speaking of butts, why didnt you give anyone a Butt Shot of the Major?  :b<br />
<br />
Think it will look pretty good when all three are together though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">01-25-06, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't take a butt shot because I didn't want Chroma hacking into my computer to delete it then crash my computer in retribution :lol.<br />
<br />
I just took another look at the image I uploaded and noticed that the way I'd initially positioned the off hand was too upright (I was just doing the first assembly to see what the end product looked like).  I've since epoxied the joints and positioned the hands right where I want them.  I've uploaded the finished model:</div></div><hr />

I would like to purchase the DVD's, but they seem awfully expensive on Amazon.com. Does anyone have any recommendations on a good online (or even retail) store where I could purchase them, and do they have a collected season one instead of having to purchase them all separately? Really enjoying the series, I am pretty new to Japanese Animation so this was quite a nice introduction.<br />

In Canada, YTV is running the first season Thursday nights (11:35) and Friday nights (midnight) but they're getting close to the end of the series (Episode 21 on Thursday, Ep. 22 on Friday, then repeats Ep. 22 the following Thursday).<br />
<br />
The second season is still only on the third (of 7) DVD releases, so if you want that collection you're either going to have to wait a couple years or buy the three DVDs that are out now, and buy the rest as they're released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DeepDiscountDVD is a very reputable website. I purchased my first season DVD's from them, as well as half my collection is from them. Without a doubt, there are no bootlegs on this site. If you'd believe it, every 6 months they hold a 20% off sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">02-11-06, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just that I can't see Bandai offering GitS for less than $8 wholesale, unless it's a recent price drop on the first series for the purpose of promoting the second series.  If someone is selling a DVD for less than wholesale, that's when you start wondering whether they're bootlegs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not that I don't understand your dillema, but bootlegs are not generally sold $8 for 4 episodes. They are usually $8 for 26 episodes. And they don't usually directly say it is R1, but either don't mention it or say it's region-free. Stuff like that.<br />
<br />
I don't find it that unbelievable, considering the best buy near me sometimes offers Ghost in the Shell at 14.95. But it certainly is suprisingly cheap, and a steal for it's price.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Actually, the retail price may have been lowered. I noticed they mention the retail price being 16.95, as opposed to the original 24.95. Other websites seem to reflect this change, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">02-11-06, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I bought all three Mezzo disks for $7/disk from ADV's site, it's just that GitS is one of Bandai's more important anime series (Mezzo isn't for ADV), so I would figure they'd milk it for as long as possible.  Lowering the price on the first season does bring in business for the second season though, so it's reasonable to assume that's why the first season is less now.<br />
<br />
I wish companies would have press releases announcing lower prices on their older series (not actual prices, just a 'we've lowered our prices on these series, so check them out from your local dealers'), especially now that the prices for legitimate DVDs are getting lower and lower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just for the sake of awareness, ADV often has these low prices at what they call &quot;Slasher sales&quot;. Basically, they punch holes in, or slash with a knife the DVD cases and covers before selling it for those prices. They do sometimes have normal sales, but it's a buyer's beware regardless.</div></div><hr />

Oblivion wasn't in, but I did pick up the latest GitS disk which came with three more figures.<br />
<br />
The main figure was Batou, and the two others were Jameson and one of the maid androids (in combat mode) from episode 14 of the first season.  The maid is a little precariously balanced (I'm going to have to do some bending and twisting to the model before I epoxy it to make sure she doesn't fall backwards) and I thought the assassin in the same episode would've made a better figure, but it's cool none the less.  Below is a pic of the three figures.</div></div><hr />
