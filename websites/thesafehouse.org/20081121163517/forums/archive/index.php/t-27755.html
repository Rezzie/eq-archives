We are a member focused democratic guild of serious mature gamers that focus on character advancement and content. Yes we plan to raid and do all the content Vanguard has to offer, But we also want to do it with our friends.<br />
<br />
We understand you cant play all the time and we understand there are times you need a break. You will always have a guild to come back to in Blades and Magic. No strict raid attendance guidelines. Membership for life. And very community focused.<br />
<br />
Dont think we are a bunch of carebears. We are Serious gamers with lots of MMORPG expierence.<br />
<br />
A little history. This was an EQ1 guild on Morrel Thule founded by a group of friends that quickly rose to power as a high end guild but without all the rules of a high end guild. We voted on almost everything. Everyone in the guild was very close and we overcame alot and did some major raids with very few numbers. relying on our teamwork and skill and less about being &quot;uber l33t&quot;.<br />
<br />
After it was all said and done. Most of us remember less about what we killed and more about the fun we had doing it. We believe the community, friendships, and fun are the most important aspects.<br />

We would like to add more to our core of friends. If you enjoy conquering obstacles! If you enjoy companionship! If you look for serious gamers that dont think they are better then everyone else! If you want to have fun! If you wanna punt gnomes! If you wanna throw dwarves! Then stop on by and say hi!<br />
