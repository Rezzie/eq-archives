holy crap man. the guy put in 152 hours in the last 2 weeks. They have already fixed the superspeed exploit I believe. I think the abandoned sewers exploit is soon to be repaired, and there's a pretty good likelyhood the nerf to gadgets so many people expeted will be going throguh now hehe.</div></div><hr />

What's this trick with superspeed that they keep talking about?  Not that I'm going to use it.  I like my tactics - run up to something and hit it with a sword until it dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-08-04, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">superspeed had a defensive bonus given to it at some point in beta because people were running into the middle of bad guys who would spawn. SS used to give you like double damage if you got hit with it on, so not sure why the change from penalty to bonus, but apparently they are getting rid of the bonus.</div></div><hr />
