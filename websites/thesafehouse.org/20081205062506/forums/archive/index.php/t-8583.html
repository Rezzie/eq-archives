Hail Chief Goonda and he will tell you they are busy doing the [enchantment of the stone].  I asked further about it (faction Kindly) and was told it was none of my business.  Drug an ogre shammy out there (amiable) and he got no further.<br />
<br />
These ogres have been there forever and I can't find any info about this.  Anyone ever get any further?  Seems like this is one of those old old eq mysteries.</div></div><hr />

Im not sure if theres anyway to get your faction higher to try and max it out and see if he will respond to you then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_aandaie</div><div class="date">06-16-03, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It appears to be just some of the RP value stuff which players think is a quest. There are a lot of other such instances, with players banging their heads against the wall for what is most likely just RP value.<br />
<br />
Its at the point now where SOE would probably not even know the difference on older stuff, the original makers are all gone. I think it was Abashi who said the RP value thing long ago, about the possibility that some &quot;non working&quot; quests are in fact not even quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aldous Dreamchaser</div><div class="date">06-16-03, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was also said that 2/3 of the Kunark and before quests were never solved and in fact some were never even found, but like you said, the origional guys are gone so I'm sure they might as well be for just RP value. Still, it'd be nice to have the new guys come in a clean up the place a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HooVooLoo</div><div class="date">06-22-03, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, another one of those quests that were never finished.  <br />
<br />
Since it involved Grobb, I doubt it would ever work now.<br />
<br />
Many moons ago there was talk about Grobb and Oggok going to war with each other.  This was a part of that abandoned story...<br />
<br />
Zimbittle in Innothule was involved, and I forget exactly how.  But he said to seek Dorn B'Dynn, and give him the secret password.<br />
<br />
So you head to North Ro, hail the REAL Dorn B'Dynn (Not the one that spawns the DEF spy and ghost spiders when killed and drops the Chardok tome, heh).<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<br />
You say, 'hail Dorn B`Dynn'<br />
<br />
Dorn B`Dynn says 'Just who are you? Do you expect some sort of courteous greeting? I have no time for idle chit chat!! Either you are here to Attend To Business or you Seek Shelter. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am here to attend to business'<br />
<br />
Dorn B`Dynn says 'So business is your mission. I have never met you. Who sent you? <br />
<br />
You say, 'Zimbittle sent me'<br />
<br />
Dorn B'Dynn says 'I don't recognize you, what is the password?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Mukk'<br />
<br />
Dorn B`Dynn says 'So you were sent by Zimbittle. Take this note to Kragia of Da Bashers in Grobb. Do not lose the note. If it were to fall into the hands of [Goonda] than this whole plan could be disrupted. Now leave, I can no longer take your fowl stench.<br />
<br />
You say, 'who is goonda?'<br />
<br />
Dorn B`Dynn says 'In the Western Plains of Karana is were you will find Goonda. He seems to be the Ogre Shaman in charge out there. <br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The note reads...<br />
<br />
Dorn,   It is imperative for Grobb to send a small detachment of Bashers to raid the Ogre encampment in the Western Plains of Karana.  During the melee, an Ogre Traitor shall retrieve the Crystal Shard from the stone and return it to the Neriak Foreign Quarter.  Do so at once.  Let no one keep the traitor from his escape.  Beware, the Oggok Shaman Marda has dispatched an agent also.<br />
<br />
Nezzka Tolax    - The Dead<br />
<br />
That's about all I know about it.  Marda, Kragia, Goonda, they all just seemed to eat the note at various faction levels.  (Well, when NPCs still ate items.)  Although I never did attempt it at fondly, which was the highest faction at the time.<br />
<br />
Another story with a good amount of intrigue and suspense, but led nowhere from what I can tell.  *sighs*<br />
