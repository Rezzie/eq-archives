<br />
I&quot;ve got 2 rings in my posession, neither of which seem to do anything, and I was wondering whether anyone knew anything about them.<br />
<br />
1) Ring I got from the lost brother quest in Beggar's Nest in Ch1.  It's called X's ring, where X is the dead brother who was part of the cult.  Can't sell it<br />
<br />
2) Ring I got from a random guy outside the city in ch 2, on my way to the caves.  The guy told me that he hoped it would bring me luck (the conversation made me think he was an assassin, until he gave me the ring LOL).<br />
<br />
Anyone know what these rings are for?<br />
<br />
