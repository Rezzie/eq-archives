I've been hitting unrest for them and keep thinking there HAS to be somewhere better I don't know about.<br />

Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drax</div><div class="date">05-30-02, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unrest is a great place. You can stay in the relatively safe courtyard, and collect zombie skins, amanita phalloidae, and grave mold. If you feel a bit adventurous, go inside and get some darkbone marrow. Plus, the occasional tormented undead will carry fine steel.<br />
<br />
I've not had an Unrest skin collection session in many months, but by the end of the last one (~2.5hrs, around lvl 35), I had collected 2 stacks skins and nearly a full stack of phalloidae (I currently had 6 stacks in the bank, tho' I have a ways before I can use it. Only have 108 in toxicology right now.  )<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I think SK has a ring of undead with about 8-14 spawns (can't remember  ), either zombies or skeletons, and a pretty decent respawn rate. Drom, Master BSer</div></div><hr />

Hands down the best place for them is Stonebrunt however.  You might want to pack a bow, or some other means of long range pulling though to make the most of your time. -- Lemac Dushae, Guild Leader for the Court of Jesters<br />

<br />
Yes, here at Swipey's we have up to 30 stacks of vial making skins available!  They're mostly the much sought after, lightweight &quot;zombie skin&quot;, but we also have a relatively small supply of &quot;puma&quot; and &quot;black wolf&quot; skins.  Normally here at Swipey's we sell skins for 20 pp/stack, but mention that you heard about us from the Safehouse and get 50 % off!  Yes, 50 % off!  that's only 10 pp per stack!  Why waste another hour farming greens when, for a mere 10 pp you can fulfill all your vial skin needs here at Swipey's? So come on down to Swipey's Skin Emporium today!*<br />
<br />
Swipey's Skin Emporium is located just off the East Common Lands, in little ol' North Freeport.  My man &quot;Bankbox&quot; will be happy to assist in filling your order, so long as I'm not raiding at the time.<br />

<br />
You get skins &amp;amp; you get poison ingredients.<br />
<br />
Pelts are a nice idea... However, You need Low, Med, or High quality pelts. Ruined pelts don't work... Named pelts don't work (eg. Lion Skin, Grizzly Bear Skin)... and the normal drop is Riuned. Then you have to bother with carrying 3 different stacks since you're guaranteed not to get a bunch of one kind w/o getting a fair amount of another. They're just a pain.<br />
<br />
In Unrest, you just round up &amp;amp; kill off the whole yard at once basicly... collect the zombie skins which drop in 2s a lot more once you start farming... wait about 5min &amp;amp; repeat.<br />
Better yet, take a lvl 15-20 Twink there &amp;amp; get some xp while you farm. I normally gather 3 or 4 stacks of skins, 1-2 stacks of Marrow, and 2+stacks of mold. Not to mention a level or 2 of xp. <br />

Killed the kitty cats for puma skins (pretty common drop) and zombies for skins. Plus, many players sell these off to the merchants so you can buy them as well.<br />

Side note: you can also collect asp poison sacs, spider poison sacs and embalming dust here fairly easily. The sacs you can make in to poison at low skill and the embalming dust I used for skill ups. Restyn<br />

solo - min level 55, better 60, self-healing a must, named can still be dangerous even at 60 (I died twice to a named - had an add though)<br />

grouped - I guess you can start at 45+ in a group, or duo/trio at 50+<br />

<br />
At the wizzie spire in SK, there are 2 spawn points next to each other.  Each spawn point is on a 6 minute timer. Each spawn point will either spawn 1 to 6 skeletons or 1 to 6 zombies. The spawn points are independant of each other. Maldicion Heartfyre - Assassin ~Retired~<br />

<br />
anyway id go to unrest but thats not all. regularly check the merchants in BBM, kaladim, felwithe and kelethin zombie skin is only 1.2 gold each with 86 cha. i have bought hundreds of skins, grave mold, snake venom sacks, asp sacks, ichor, crystallsted bone marrow (also check the secret lich caves in everfrost for massive loads of this note: beware the lich he lifetaps for 1k) cynid corms is a pain in the ass either way. merchants sell for no lower then 2p each same with embalming dust and wasp sacks (these are so much of a pain in the ass). <br />
<br />
you can also get friends who hunt in unrest to get you stuff. offer to pay then 4p per stack of skins. its worth it to newbies.  <br />
<br />
farming yourself takes to much time. spend YOUR time in south ro where asp sacks, spider sacks, snake sacks, and embalming dust drop as well as a few zombie skins. go to merchants. either go to EF or SRO at level 40ish skill. then use those ichor and embalming u get to train up to 80ish.</div></div><hr />
