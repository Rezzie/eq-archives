In Fact, an Empathy Controller is easily a better healer than any non-empathy defender. Their heals are 75% as big as an Empath Defender's Heals. So you'd have to burn more endurance, but not a huge amount more.<br />
<br />
The trick is that when you are doing Your Crowd Control thing, you probably won't be able to do that AND full heals for a large group at once. But in a smaller 3-4 person group, you should be good. <br />
<br />
Several Healers in Beta decided that when live came they were going that route, thinking that would give them slightly lower damage ehaling power, but a lot more Damage mitigation power, and thus make the healing job easier.<br />
<br />
The one downside: Aggro. If all you are doing is Healing, it is a cakewalk to avoid Aggro. If you are doing Crowd control and healing for te grou, you will be getting a large share of Aggro, which will interfere with your ability to be an effective healer, and make it much mroe risky to use Absorb Pain. AP Heals a ton, but takes like 15% of your health per cast, and makes you unhealable except by direct heals for a while. i.e. No using AP and then Healing Aura to repair the damage, you'd need someone else with a targetted heal to help you recover from that.<br />
<br />
But It would give you a lot of versatility. Assuming both sets of powers were appropriately slotted, you could join a group and Fill a role as a Healer, or as a Crowd Control Expert, but both might be pushing it in a large group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Expatriate</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a Mind/Empathy Controller, and while I can heal nearly as well as a Empathy Defenter, my main focus in Crowd Control, so I don't always look at the health bars of others, though I do notice when they change color, signifying low health.<br />
<br />
I would probably watch health more if I were to be main healer, but I always group with Nyssa's Defender who is an Empathy/Psy, so I am always a backup healer, and she lets me know when I need to help.<br />
<br />
I think the Controller with Empathy is a better healer than any of the non-empathy defenders because of the Heal Other ability, but I'm not sure about the differences in damage avoidance of a Controller verses some of the other Defender Power sets.  Sure, I can lock down all the adds, unless I am grouped with people who like to AE, which make my Hypnotizes useless.  At 18th I do get Total Domination, an AE Incapaciate, and AE damage will not matter at that point.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling my way of damage avoidance is best, but don't we all :)</div></div><hr />

Then he decided he wanted a blaster instead. Like we need more of those around!  :lol</div></div><hr />
