<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">09-27-06, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The final volume of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig was released yesterday and I must say it's the best looking DVD box I've ever seen.  It's similar to the case that came with the first season's volume 7 SE, but 'kicked up a notch', as the saying goes.<br />
<br />
If you've been following the releases you know that the special edition tins have a circular window in the front which shows off the DVD.  The tin box uses the circular window to display the box art on the back of the volume 7 DVD tin, and inside it has dividers for each volume.  Also coming with the volume is a CD (Stand Alone Complex OST 3) and a Motoko Kusanagi figurine.<br />
<br />
The content of the DVD is good as well, and the DTS sound is great during the battle scenes.  Overall I liked the first season a bit better, but as a whole I thought the 2nd Gig is a very well done anime series and well worth watching.<br />
<br />
Below are a few pics of the contents of the volume 7 special edition.</div></div><hr />

But can't afford to get it, have other boxsets I'm waiting for. Too bad, looks like it would fit the first season GITS box I have.</div></div><hr />
