<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_MeleeECI</div><div class="date">10-27-02, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently have 40 skill and was wondering if the old guide &quot;Guide to raising Poison Fast and Cheap!&quot; is still valid and true as being the fastest way to do it. Money is not an issue but time is. I started my rogue before kunark came out but just never did anything with poison. I would really like to start now but the thought of chasing snakes in EC and Ro and all that doesn't make me eager to start.<br />
<br />
Any complete guides would be very welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You can now run to and from aknon very easily and SoS supplies are all in PoK</div></div><hr />
