2.  We are going to give EQII beta access to each person who pre-registers for the Fan Faire, and the current plan is to give everyone their beta access on 10/11 when registration closes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose that rules we Europeans out of the pre-pay beta.   I'll just wait for the real thing and then bumble along in my own way dropping corpses all over Norrath as I vainly try to solo my rogue...</div></div><hr />

Please show me on the Everquest web site where it says the release date is November 16th. (And don't tell me your local Gamestop or VideoGame Store told you.)</div></div><hr />

My guess is it gets released that day no matter what state it is in heh.</div></div><hr />

Bliz's stance is its done when its done. All release dates people have seen are BS made by Game stores. Dont know about EQ2, but WoW could be delayed into 05.</div></div><hr />

This is most likely not true.  The latest financial report, found in <br />
<br />
http://finance.vivendiuniversal.com/finance/download/pdf/H12004EarningsSlides_140904.pdf<br />
<br />
states that the product will very likely be out in November of this year.  Since the report was written in September, they should have had a pretty good handle on the timeline.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to avoid providing a date to the gaming community - it's quite another to misprepresent profit timelines to your shareholders.  My bets are on November.</div></div><hr />
