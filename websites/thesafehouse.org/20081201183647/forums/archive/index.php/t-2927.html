Still waiting for the level 20th+ rules to come out for 3rd ed so I can continue the character a bit. I wrote a history for the character, and had a very interesting feel for the character, so everybody found it fun to interact with the character in games.<br />
<br />
In honesty, I really like the multi-classing rules in 3rd a lot better then anything they ever had in 2nd. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Random TM</div><div class="date">04-17-02, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My fighter, Tycho, who was utterly insane. He'd attack a demi-lich for looking at him wrong, hit on an angry drow priestess that had just killed the party's elf (never leave home without one), and thought 'dragon' meant a kind of turnip. Also, he JUST WOULDN'T DIE, no matter what anyone threw at him.<br />
<br />
High points included carrying a goblin around under his arm for half a campaign (before pitching it over a waterfall) because he needed someone 'to talk to.' Getting isolated from the rest of the party, finding a sleeping red dragon, and charging it screaming 'Leeeeezard!.' Getting into a philosophical debate with the aforemenioned drow priestess over evil in this day and age. That debate ended with the death of the entire party excluding him, if I recall.</div></div><hr />

BAD BAD BAD.  Then using it to buy a weapon, but I didn't know they bag had a ward on it.  Merchant opens it, dies, I take gold and run.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zoogie</div><div class="date">04-20-02, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh . . . mine was a Neutral Good Satyr Priest who followed the goddess of love. To briefly describe him: He had rejected the boorish actions of his fellows when he realized there was more to love (and life) than chasing down nymphs in the forest.<br />
He wore a black bandana and had a pointed mustache, and carried a rapier at his side. (Very roguish!  )<br />
<br />
He got killed at level three when a monotheist missionary attacked him because he thought he was the devil. (It was the goat legs, I'm pretty sure.) Priests of love roll d4s for HD, and the missionary rolled a full damage critical hit with a morning star. Poor lil' guy.</div></div><hr />

He went to church and preached every sunday, and he did confessions on saturday.  The rest of the time he was a contract killer with a 50% stake in a casino.   One &quot;episode&quot; he killed and entire building full of mafia, GTA3 style.  That campaign had some of the best moments ever.  The campaign kind of just fizzled out though and I havent played him since. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mildaene</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine has to be Margon (Fantasy Heroes rpg, playing in Middle Earth), who on the first real mission we did, actually kept the accounting book (which was actually a ring, projecting names and figures when put near a light) of the local assassin guild. Said book was the thing we were supposed to destroy.<br />
<br />
Turned out the guild boss was a demon, and everyone ran in fear, while poor Margon wasn't afraid at all (well until he noticed every one else had legged it or was lying on the floor), and used his jump spell (jump and safe fall = best thief spells ever :) ) to bounce off a wall and impale the demon with his shortsword. <br />
<br />
Let's say best critical roll I've ever made :) 1 hit kill in the head (GM was nearly crying :) ). Only thing the dead-boss-now-reverted-to-human-form had was that ring, which I deftly put into my pocket. Only later did I realize what the ring truely was, and presented my companions with a meld minor magical amulet, telling them that was the &quot;book-amulet&quot;, I took from the corpse, and destroyed because it was so corrupted. Everyone actually believed me (some had suspicions, but heh next time, don't run away like a girl, if you want to know what really happens when a thief is next to a corpse). The other reason was that the ring was cursed, making me want not to destroy or relinquish it.<br />
<br />
I then used the ring to blackmail the local nobles in every city we went through, and nobody ever suspected why bad things seemed to happen to inns strangers were last seen in, or why guards would single us and rummage through our packs looking for &quot;a book&quot; or something.... (yeah, Margon wasn't very good at blackmailing :) )<br />
<br />
Don't think they ever suspected anything, even when Margon started to (secretly) dabble in shadow magic, or was suddenly able to speak with the orcs using dark speech (&quot;ahem... that's an orcish dialect... yes it is!&quot;).<br />
<br />
<br />
Uhm well I'm not going to detail everything, but that's my favourite character ever :)<br />

He was playing a halfling with an affection with called shots to the eyes.  Big monster come out? Called shots to the eyes.<br />
<br />
The worst thing was was that he'd roll 19-20 on over 75percent of his called shots.  I mean what can you do?<br />
<br />
He finally started just carrying tons of high quality throwing knives around in lieu of any other weapon.<br />
<br />
God I hated him</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our group started out with 12 people and Silk had 50% on his side and 50% against him most of the time... it was very interesting. <br />
<br />
Of the 12 starting characters, Silk was the ONLY original character to survive to the end of the year (in fact, a few of them even died at Silk's hand--they attacked me!). Every player eventually lost their starting characters and had rerolled at least 2 or 3 times. Silk was exceptionally good at survival and manipulation.   <br />
<br />
There was even one session where the DM designed for all of us to be killed (and later resurrected) but Silk escaped by climbing a tower to get away from our attackers and doing a Rope Trick to hide. The DM later told me we were SUPPOSED to die and I screwed up his plans...but he was good and worked my escape into the story quite well.  <br />
<br />
Good old Silk... Remmi (ornery dwarven rogue and thwapper of idjits!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Grahamulus00</div><div class="date">05-09-02, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm  The one of mine I liked the best is a Sci-Fi Hero character named John. Yes just John. He was a 'Mech Pilot who was a Wiz with engineering and Tinkering. He runs around with a hand on a stick and a backpack. Inside this backpack is a tactical Nuke and the hand is actually a lockpick for the palm reading security doors. The group didn't figure all this out for quite a while and was quite dismayed and agitated that this nuke was in the the same room with them let alone on the same planet. And the hand came in handy a few times when the spook types couldn't get into a few rooms on a run into Kurita space. He had to go with them because it took his computer and engineering skills to figure out what was in the room and how it worked. He offered to destroy the place but the spooks said no just make it unusable. Yes he had his backpack with him.  He made the nuke himself and actually made his rolls to the point where the blast radius was exactly one block off of center. Quirky was an understatement and the only reason the group kept him around after they successfully got the backpack away from him was that his technical skills far outweighed his mental instability. There wasn't much he couldn't hack into or understand once he looked at it. It was fun watching the other people in the group have to change their tactics because he was around. They tended to examine his luggage constantly. I am going to have to get back to that game soon. <br />
<br />
Needless to say when ever I run a game now one of my friends always brings in a quirky character of there own to brighten up my day.<br />

<br />
depraved drow underdark druid comes upon his lifeless corpse and reincarnates him as a gold elf, following him stealthily watching the destruction fangol causes in his unholy rage at what has befallen him. fangol finally finds out about this druid and exacts his vengeance upon her, in horrible unspeakable non pg-13 ways<br />
<br />
fangol was a smart hobgoblin tho (intelligence 16) after awhile he figures out that as an elf he can cause more chaos for the elven nation then he ever could as a hobgoblin so he heads to cormanthor and starts learning, i mean REALLY learning what it means to be an elf. after awhile he classes into spymaster prestige class and proceeds to begin laying out plots that will ensure the deaths of many elves, turned into a very political character. was very very cool. at the end of it all he was rogue 5/assassin5/spymaster4/wizard1/ranger1 (wizard and ranger levels were added to assist him with his cover identities)<br />
<br />
other cool char i played was my dwarven rogue Trapsong Mithrildeath, Took every trapmaking, lock picking feat in the book, also had int 16, he created over 10 totally unique traps as well as being the only person alive to decipher the chaos sphere (took a deck of many things to accomplish it tho heh) anyways if i play with you guys in NWN id play the dwarf as from what ive heard hobgoblins arent playable EvisceratusMaximusInyour face againVeniVidi Vici</div></div><hr />
