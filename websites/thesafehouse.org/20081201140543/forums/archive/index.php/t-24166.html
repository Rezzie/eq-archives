<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warspite_AB</div><div class="date">05-05-06, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've been playing the 7 day free trial, and kind of sitting on the fence about subscribing.<br />
<br />
it seems that the game is lacking immersion (which should be the bread and butter of DDO), part of the appeal of eq1/2 and wow was the size of the game world, massive. which lends a game towards a sort of.. epic feel?  How many of you can honestly say you werent impressed by your first run from qeynos to freeport??<br />
<br />
DDO doesnt seem to have that, an entire game based around one city?  i've been playing (and thoroughly enjoying it mind you) for the last couple days, but i still feel like i'm in the tutorial :(<br />
<br />
secondly, the game looks like its all based on instances - which again, hurts the immersion factor - i'd like to know that there are other groups hunting besides my party, otherwise i might as well just play diablo.<br />
<br />
Maybe its a case of the grass being greener in eq, but i miss grinding.  a goodly portion of eq1's appeal was the downtime, chatting with  group members and making friends - if a group just gets together for a quest and disbands after completion, its really hard to make friends/have a steady group.<br />
<br />
so those who've been around a bit longer, do the concerns i listed (content/community) improve at higher levels?</div></div><hr />

<br />
While DDO's content and grouping dynamics are awesome...the community suffers b/c of DDO's city instancing and other factors...</div></div><hr />
