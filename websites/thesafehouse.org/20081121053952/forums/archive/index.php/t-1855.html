The second somone finds a receipt with your credit card number they used to be able to order up all kinds of @#%$.  Even the pizza guy at dominoes could use your number to buy some new car parts for his car. <br />

The Headaches caused by AVS (Address Verification Systems) prevents BILLIONS of dollars in creditcard fraud every year.. That means it's harder to steal your money..<br />

<br />
My last apartment - in Los Angeles - had a management crew that refused to sign for packages, and we had the worst UPS and FedEx drivers on the planet - any packages delivered to you would be left in an unattended mail room, with no cameras, with an elevator in the room.  The drivers would NOT leave the &quot;Sorry we missed you&quot; notes, they would just leave packages lying around.  There were 430 units in the complex, and everyone had access to the mail room.<br />
<br />
Anything I wanted to buy online had to be shipped to my work address, or I stood a fair chance of not getting it.<br />
<br />
Companies that understood that got my money.<br />
<br />
Companies that refused to deal with simple working-guy realities didn't get the money.  It was obviously worth it to them to lose the customer instead of working with them.</div></div><hr />

It is safer for businesses to enforce address verification.<br />

I've ordered tons of parts from NewEgg over several years, with shipping to both the billing address and two different work addresses...then after I moved to a different state, I've had parts shipped to a work address.  Never had a problem with any order.  Maybe it's something your bank is doing? Amadan  ::  Child of the Phoenix  ::<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shanar</div><div class="date">09-17-03, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That may very well be.<br />
<br />
If the Billing Address you give does not match they will simply say &quot;No&quot; they will tell you nothing more, as if they did it would simply make it easier for you to fix the problem if you were committing fraud.<br />
<br />
Common problems, the address you give them has to match EXACTLY what your bank has on record, character by character, spaces and all.<br />
<br />
The City name has to be the same.. Sendng me mail for example you could put Noblesville or Indianapolis if you have my Zip right it's gonna get to me.. But for my CC it has to be Noblesville or it'll fail.<br />
<br />
And the Zipcode, or Zip+4 if that is how your bank has it..<br />

<br />
Uh, sure, wherever that number came from.<br />
<br />
I'm a 30 year old computer geek with no kids, lots of disposable income, and expensive hobbies.<br />
<br />
Companies that understand how to ship to a work address get to help me dispose of the income.  If they're not flexible enough to handle that, then their competitor will - and unless I'm buying artwork or something else similarly unique, there are probably ten companies out there who have what I want, and they're only a URL away.<br />
<br />
To the original poster: Whoever you're dealing with sucks.  Find another source.  Be sure to complain about the 'first people' you went to, and you'll get better service.  Companies LOVE getting customers who were unhappy with their competition.</div></div><hr />

Most bigger companies lost a lot more than smaller companies to it.. But then in my experience they also have the money to stand behind what they sell you, not **** you around for months when something is bad.<br />
<br />
Still you know what works awesome for me? Driving to a fricking computer store and buying the parts. Most cities have decent priced wholesellers.. And even if they don't I'm a 29 year olf computer geek with THREE kids.. I can afford it surely you can too.<br />
