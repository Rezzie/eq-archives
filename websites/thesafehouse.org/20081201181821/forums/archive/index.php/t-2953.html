On the other hand, the PDF's they have on the web page (www.eqrpg.com) make it look like a quality product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Heartsong Steelsoul</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, based on the games run at Origins... I can't tell much, because the games were BAD.  I had one GM who had never played the online game, and one who told us he didn't know the rules too well, so really, I didn't learn much at all.<br />
<br />
The mana system looks pretty neat.  Bards can twist songs based on a perform skill check.  weapon delay is represented by lowering the number you get a second attack at - standard is +6/+1, while you might have a fast weapon that makes it +5/+1.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">07-16-02, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually faster weapons speeds are supposed to reduce the number between attacks,<br />
so if you have a +6/+1 attack bonus with a weapon that has a standard weapon speed, that becomes a +6/+2 with a fast weapon , and +6/+3 with a very fast weapon, and likewise slower weapons reduce this, so with a +6/+1, using a slow weapon, you only get a +6 attack, the second attack is lost<br />
<br />
lets take +10/+5 then<br />
standard +10/+5<br />
fast +10/+6/+2<br />
very fast +10/+7/+4/+1<br />
slow +10/+4<br />
very slow +10/+3</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">07-24-02, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct, all D20 material is interchangeable, with only minor *tweaks.*<br />
<br />
(ie: getting a D&amp;amp;D character into SpyCraft would involve figuring out some specialized SpyCraft stuff, HP, etc.)</div></div><hr />

My roomate got it and I'm more and more confused everyday. something about epic level spell slots being skils instead of advanced spell slotas or something. i dunno I just stab things.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">07-29-02, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">30 levels in eqrpg != 30 levels in standard d20<br />
<br />
the full 30 levels are standardized into the game, there's some nice stuff to be sure in those last 10 tens levels, but not like the epic book. Wether is stronger/weaker vs. epic is probably still to be seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Heartsong Steelsoul</div><div class="date">07-29-02, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know, the interview at the web page mentions &quot;However there's no doubt that characters in the world of Everquest can advance to epic levels of power and combat the gods themselves.  We are representing that by having the character classes advance to 30, so basically there's 10 epic levels.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sounds the same to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">08-21-02, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Players Handbook released yesterday. Got it yesterday. 380+ glossy, color pages. Beautiful, great rules, great interpretations. You can definately feel the micromanagement you're able to take in it, and how they made it &quot;feel&quot; like EQ computer game.<br />
<br />
Very good value. 8.5/10 so far, I was depressed to see a lack of stats for some low-end &quot;real&quot; EQ items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Icebreaker</div><div class="date">08-21-02, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing to remember is that EQRPG players handbook is NOT D20 its OGL thats why they can have different magic system different stats and character creation stuff.<br />
The EQ Beastiery and DM's guide and all future modules will be D20 from the sounds of it tho...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">08-22-02, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so the thing actually came out eh? Now I'll have to argue with my DM not to play it. Otherwise all he will do is go to work, play EQ, and play tabletop EQ.  <br />
<br />
At least he goes to work I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">08-22-02, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the feat that gives you an extra spell slot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">08-22-02, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pre-Order of mine confirmed to have been shiped by Amazon today.. I guess I'll get it tomorrow.   <br />

<br />
 Edit: Okay, got it now... first impression: THICK! It's almost 400 pages!   Edited by: Shadowcross  at: 8/23/02 2:39:56 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TheatreRat81</div><div class="date">08-24-02, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the new game. S&amp;S definately managed to capture the feel of EQ and transfer it into a d20 game nicely. Picked up my copy of the PHB at the Boston Fan Faire and playtested the game with the guys from White Wolf with Jete and a few friends. Lots of fun. Definately like the new mana-based magic system as opposed to the standard D&amp;D spells-per-day. Another nice touch - charts on how to transfer your online character to d20. Really nice job! Just wish the Monster Man. was coming out sooner! I want adventures to run!<br />

<br />
Just lovely, but what's missing is a straight-out-of-the-book, soon-as-you-buy-it capacity for playing.<br />
<br />
Ah well, now I can reference this for a vague idea of what spells spellcasters should be using on EverCamp, er, EverQuest  <br />
<br />
Anyone else see tons of 30th level pen and paper characters getting reved up to go 'camp' the Planes and finding out EverCamp is dead in the book?</div></div><hr />

Maybe even wait for MM...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DreamspinnerSethan</div><div class="date">08-29-02, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Monstrous Manual is coming out earlier than the DMG for EverQuest P&amp;amp;P . . .<br />
<br />
And the DMG is what has the Phat Lewts in it, so you will probably still be waiting two months to play . . .<br />
<br />
On the plus side, you can always take a look at the existing world online and take cues from there on what to start with depending on your group's level and knowledge of Norrath.<br />
<br />
(Are they level 60 uber-guildies tripped out in the 'best' armor and weapons to date? OR your mid 30's-to-mid-40's casual players who know a lot about the world other than 'this critter drops this'.)<br />
<br />
If so inspired you can ignore what Verant has decided each zone's level is and run a game like off of Stormhammer: high level fun only, loot which is more useful for a P&amp;amp;P game than online . . . events which are not just beat up the bad guy and ninja-loot the corpse . . . and NO PHREAKING CAMPING . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">08-29-02, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can always use the monsters from the 3rd edition dnd in your eq game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and as you crest the hill in Queynos hills you see holly windstalker striking down yet another new adventurer for trying to defend themselves from a viciouse wolf. Suddenly the Tarrasque leaps on her and devours her whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
not that I spent a week when my shaman reached 30 killing holly windstalker for repeatedly killing every character I have started in queynos or anything.</div></div><hr />

maybe I need to get this and have holly become a shadowknight/druid, so my players can kill her.</div></div><hr />
