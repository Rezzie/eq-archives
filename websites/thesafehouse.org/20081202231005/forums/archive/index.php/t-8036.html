This is mainly due to the Aggro control of the whole raid, while a living rogue is far more useful than a dead one.<br />
But AA skill called Escape allowed us to freely(?) test the poison effect on many mobs, and I'd like to have some input from bold rogues out there.<br />
<br />
My specific question is this :<br />
&quot;Which mob is slowable by the rogues, while not by shammy ?&quot;<br />
<br />
In the safehouse thread, it is reported by that ToV shimmering / Glimmering Drakes are that type. <br />
What others are they ...? <br />
<br />
Anyone tried to apply SLOW poison on the AoW or SoRZ ? <br />
How about Arch Lich or High Priest  ? <br />
If it lands at all, how long does it last ? <br />

P.S. This discussion brought by my guildie who said there are some mobs with built-in &quot;Immune to Attack Speed Change&quot;.  Though I believe his explanation, if the ToV Drakes are slowable by rogue poisons only, there must be similar mobs which ppl believes Unslowable, but still slowable by us.<br />

These come up with text like &quot;This mob is immune to changes in its attack speed&quot; when you attempt to land a slow effect on them.<br />
<br />
Then there are mobs which are practically immune to shaman slows.  This is mostly due to very high magic resistance.  Shamen do have a disease-based slow (Plague of Insects) which is quite a low value.  Sometimes mobs are resistant to that as well.<br />
<br />
This leaves us with a poison based slow which we can try on the mobs which are resistant to magic and disease slows, but aren't completely immune.  This is where we might have a slowing niche.</div></div><hr />

If my memory serves me right he is &quot;immune to attack speed changes&quot;... Now I have seen and heard of many instances of our slow poisons landing on him. Spine Break being the confirmed one as it's cheap/easy to make, though is of very short duration for said fight. I'm anxious to try the biggest version...<br />
<br />
I've never landed one myself, as sacrificing a lvl 60 rogue in a Vindicator fight is just plain stupid, but I do on occasion slip one to one of our lower rogues...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AddoPovar</div><div class="date">10-06-02, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vindi was (once in the day, way back before they put in the coding possibility for immunity to slow) more or less immune to magic. This was before the disease slow spell came, so rogues then had a chance to land slow on him, shamans did not. Whether it was at that time intentional that rogues could slow him is unknown, but his high MR was because they did not want shaman or enchanter slow landed since they would trivialize him.<br />
<br />
Since that time, Vindi has been made immune to changes in attack speed, regardless of what spell or poison used against him. This has allowed VI to lower his magic resist, making other debuffs and dots/dd land.</div></div><hr />
