<br />
Here is a Script to get a NPC spawn to give a quest out to only good or evil players.<br />
<br />
1) Go into the OnSpawn script for the NPC and uncomment the line 'SetSpawnInCondition (NW_FLAG_PERCIEVE_EVENT);', then re-save under a different name and compile.<br />
<br />
2) Make a new script for the OnUserDefined event like so:<br />
<br />
#include &quot;NW_I0_GENERIC&quot;<br />
void main()<br />
{<br />
  int nEvent = GetUserDefinedEventNumber();<br />
  if (nEvent == 1002) // OnPerceive<br />
  {<br />
    object oPC = GetLastPerceived();<br />
    int nAlign = GetAlignmentGoodEvil(oPC);<br />
    if (nAlign == ALIGNMENT_GOOD)<br />
    {<br />
      AdjustReputation(oPC, OBJECT_SELF, -100);<br />
      DetermineCombatRound();<br />
    }<br />
  }<br />
}<br />
<br />
This will cause a NPC to attack any Good aligned PC. Set the NPC starting faction to +100 PC friendly, if an Good aligned PC comes close it drops the faction to Hostile, and attacks<br />
<br />
To change it to attack any EVIL PC just change the:<br />
if (nAlign == ALIGNMENT_GOOD) to if (nAlign == ALIGNMENT_EVIL)<br />
<br />
And compile.<br />
<br />
Useful for setting mob to hand out quests to certain alignments.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />

I was looking for something like that!<br />
<br />
One of the things I didn't like about the single player campaign is how regardless of your alignment, you always got treated the same.<br />
<br />
Something I hope to rectify in my mod anyway.  One of the things that sort of ticks me off is when people don't play their alignment, other things like having your alignment not matter is annoying too.<br />
<br />
If yer gonna be evil...Fine, cheat, steal, murder, then go hide from guards, don't expect merchants to be nice and all that crap.<br />
<br />
If yer gonna be a goodie goodie...Be good for cryin out loud!  Don't go breaking into people's houses.  Don't go rifling through ever drawer, crate and barrel your would be riteous hands come acrossed.  Don't steal, murder or hang out in A_SEEDY_ESTABLISHMENT_0008 in your spare time.<br />
<br />
ppffft enough bitching, more scripting for me. &lt;u&gt;Chemistrius Ul'Veldrin***&lt;/u&gt;<br />

<br />
Last night we played Chapter One for a bit and had a blast.  There was a NG monk, a ?E Wizard, and me (LE monk) in the party.<br />
<br />
Everytime an NPC gave me the option of being even slightly un-good I took it in conversations.  As a result, most NPC's had to deal with the Druid because I didn't feel it was my duty to help them save their precious city.  Hell, I was drafted into it forcibly by the City Government anyways.<br />
<br />
Whenever the druid wasn't looking the wizard and I would extort money from NPC's, bust in doors, or kill a guard or 3.<br />
<br />
The wizard accidentally(I swear it was accidental) cast some sort of cold spell at the guard and started getting pimped so I jumped in to save him.  We took out that pesky guard and was like Whew... good thing we killed him before he killed you!<br />
<br />
Next thing you know my Cleric Henchman started screaming something about Sammy Moonbow (I know, but it sounds like it) and killed some Doomsayers!<br />
<br />
*Blink*  Good thing there weren't a lot of same-faction NPC's about or we'd have a rabid *good-aligned* cleric killing off townies.<br />
<br />
The druid was like, uh guys... I just got an alignment shift 10 points to Evil... Next time you're coming with me to the store and sell all the loot.<br />
<br />
I don't think it was very Lawful for me to be doing all that crime-type stuff, but I couldn't help it.  Heh, everytime I turned around I was getting an alignment shift for the Druid escorting old people to the guards or setting free some bloody zoo animals.  I had to keep my evil reputation intact, ya know?  Besides, I was drafted unwillingly into service.  They OWED me money! (and a bit of blood, by golly). Baroness Acinonyx Lanoche<br />

<br />
So if you program your mod well, you can make sure people who don't play their alignment end up as whatever alignment they are acting like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That bit in Character generation where you type in the name of your deity. does it make any difference at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the same difference as the race-subtype I guess - none.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And on the topic of changing alignments.. did anyone EVER get an alignment hit towards order/chaos? I remeber getting ones for evil/good all the time, but never for order/chaos. ShadowCross Bladesong<br />
