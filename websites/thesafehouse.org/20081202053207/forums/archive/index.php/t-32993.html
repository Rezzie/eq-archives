<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantspel</div><div class="date">01-25-08, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats the one that drops the life tap ring right? He is inside the large cave/hut thingy on the southern gorglak totem farming area (should only be 2 right next to each other, its the one towards the back more). He is at the very back of the cave/hut to the right when you walk in. He has a place holder so you may need to kill it a few times for him to spawn.<br />
<br />
When i fought him he kinda glitched outside of the hut/cave thing and resetted (annoying as heck, he was at about 20% life when he did this) but made for easy (but a bit long) bleed kiting around the shallow water there. Not sure if this is a reacurring problem, but something to keep in mind just incase.</div></div><hr />
