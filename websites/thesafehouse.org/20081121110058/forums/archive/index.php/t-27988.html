You could also try running a new character through the starter quests.  Any of the non-reason races should be offered Truth Be Told at the end of the Repeals tutorial, and the card might be tradable.</div></div><hr />

I definately got my Truth card in the Khal tutorials but I think it was added directly into my abilities not as a card you right click on. Clearly though I seem to be missing something where this card is concerned because the tutorial made it sound alot better than it really looked.</div></div><hr />

If I recall correctly Truth be Told is one of those repeal cards that costs two of one and gives you four of another. Flat Dismissal, the one that converts green into red, has been absolutely indespensible for my Vulmane. Every NPC tends to favor one type of card that will give you one color to work with, if you have big value cards of a different type and you can convert between them it's the absolute most efficient and guaranteed way to win.<br />
<br />
The major strategies I've found so far have been playing low cards and starving them (if they tend to use just one color you can use rebuttals to do this even better), generating your own (I think of this as the default &quot;standard&quot; hand to start out with since you never know what an NPC will give you before you try it), using all of the no-cost cards to just try to nickel and dime them (when your favorite color is out and you got nothing to work with), or converting with repeals (pretty much a sure victory if the colors align right)</div></div><hr />
