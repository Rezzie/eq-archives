<br />
<br />
&quot;Gruel Spoon&quot;<br />
Large wooden spoon that, when stuck in any bowl like object immediatly fills it was brown pasty cardboard tasting like gruel which fully sustains the player.<br />
<br />

Nothing beats sticking it in one of your friend's boots during the night and them forgetting to check in the morning.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glip the Gnome</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, its a great item.<br />
<br />
Word of advise if you ever get one though.  Stick it on your belt, putting it in a bag of holding is *not* a good idea.<br />

(look like a pair of dentures)<br />
When placed in the mouth they adhere to the wearers natural teeth (or gums, if no teeth) and allow them to consume anything in any amount, one bite at a time.  The wearer will suffer no ill effects from ingested poisons, and, so long as there is matter to consume, will not starve.  Additionally, as the teeth may be used to take a bite out of most anything, they provide the wearer with a powerful  biting attack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeters</div><div class="date">02-21-02, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it said in a footnote somewhere that you can go over ten (as long as it isnt +10 armor or something, but a supplementary enchantment) if you can pay for it..<br />
<br />
and anyway my DM approved it..just my luck, we'll probably go up against something for our first encounter that has a shatter spell and will lose all of our uber items, just for it to be ironic..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">02-21-02, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm, was it the right or left hand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elerion</div><div class="date">02-21-02, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had to do a Meddik (read: Google-search) on the Head of Vecna ... how incredibly cool is that  <br />
<br />
On a side note, I'm quite impressed at the fact that this GM is; able to GM two groups independently in one tight storyline, is able to keep the druid out of the trap discussion and letting him do his own &quot;adventure&quot; in the middle of it (figuring out information on his own like group 2 was supposed to, and going to get it),  and keeping a straight face through it all  <br />
<br />
I wish I was that good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">02-21-02, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glip, IIRC there's an item exactly like the one you describe in 2nd edition. Don't make me dig for books, but I think it's called Merylund's Spoon. I've had a couple characters get them over the years, and one of them survived in an snowy mountain pass for three months in nothing but a pair of boots of warmth and a Merylund's Spoon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glip the Gnome</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That'd be the spoon!<br />

Man I love that thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a really cool item in monte cook's first book of eldritch magic, was the bulette walker. basically, a hollowed out body of a bulette that could seat something like five-seven people, with one being the driver. pretty much the fantasy equivalent of a tank or a weird mech  <br />

<br />
Very fun item, not great for combat but utility items are the most fun anyway.  Its great for fishing!  <br />
<br />
Only reason I even got it was dumb luck though. Hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dumb luck rules. I found out just how kick-arsed rings of free action are when I got one in a random loot roll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My old group was just me and a necromancer and the DM (hard to find people to play in Lancaster PA, imagine that  )<br />
<br />
So he'd always be getting out of unusual situations with that thing:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap, I wish we had a 20 foot pole and a boat right about now!&quot;<br />
<br />
*necromancer grins and reaches into his robe*</div></div><hr />

Sad, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">02-23-02, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, you people made me whip out my RPGA binders. These are the cooler unique items I own...<br />
<br />
 Leather Jacket of Reptiles (3E)<br />
The wearer is able to wildshape as a normal lizard from 1 inch to 2 feet in length as a druid of 10th level. They also recieve a +2 insight bonus to Charisma related checks when dealing with lizards. (The 2E version was slightly cooler, instead of a crappy bonus, it was Empathy (as per Ranger ability) with lizards.)<br />
<br />
 Ring of Sound (2E)<br />
As the Encyclopedia Magica description. I no longer have this, but it was freakin' awesome while it lasted. (Not  exactly unique, but to my knowledge the only one in the campaign.)<br />
<br />
 Belly Chain of Splendid Minotaur Power (3E)<br />
This belly chain is made of thick brass links, from which dangle charms shaped like stylized wings. It grants the wearer increased strength, adding +1 enhancement bonus to her strength score. In addition, due to the vaguely compelling symbols etched on the wing charms, it acts as a rod of splendor. Unfortunately, it cannot produce a pavilion, as Minotaurs are not noted for their canvas crafts. (Another powered down item, in 2E it could whip out tents. :&quot;&gt; O)<br />
<br />
And my one time favourite item, which has been rendered non-magical by plot, etc...<br />
<br />
 Tarot Card - Art (2E)<br />
This Card has a number of powers associated with it. These powers may only be called upon by the owner of the card.<br />
<br />
1 ~ The owner of the card may leave any module fpr the duration of the module, appearing in a specific planar location. Once in this location the owner must spend 1d4 days before they return to the Prime Material Plane and Raven's Bluff. This action requires a full round of concentration upon the card and they are NOT able to bring others with them.<br />
<br />
2 ~ An Artist is fickle but adept at the more useless things in life. The owner of this card is able to cast Cantrip ten times per day at their highest level.<br />
<br />
Special Effect ~ The owner of this card has become &quot;special&quot; they have all the disadvantages of a swashbuckler (higher chance of being a target) and the noble kit (must pay 20% higher for best quality of everything), but recieve none of the advantages of either kit. Jhani: What's the time?<br />
Mom: 9:09<br />
Jhani: &gt;:O<br />
Jhani: I said What's the time?!<br />
Mom: *sighs*<br />
Mom: It's time to buy ale, Ninja.<br />
Jhani: /cheer<br />
Jhani: 11111<br />
Jhani: !!!!!!1</div></div><hr />
