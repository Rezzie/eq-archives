just go to your local bookstore.<br />
<br />
for those who missed it the first time, Traps and Treachery is a book made by Sword and Sorcery--specifially targeted towards rogues, but the majority of the book are hundreds of really ingenious traps<br />
<br />
first printing was backlogged in a few days, this is thier second printing as of a few days ago, catch it while you can =) Safehouse Cutie of the 60th Circle<br />

Isn't that White Wolf's fantasy line?  Methinks I need to go check it out.  Thankee, Jete! Kehvrynne Quickblade, Professional Damsel of Distress<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">03-19-02, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, SSS is the fantasy publisher owned by WW, but it really has nothing to do with WW besides that. for instance, malhavoc press' (monte cook's company) stuff is actually published and released by SSS, but again has nothing to do with WW themselves   SSS also releases the scarred land books, ravenloft, and some other stuff as well.<br />
<br />
some other good publishers are green ronin publishing, and mongoose games.<br />

<br />
Plus it has rules for building your own and setting DC's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vorashus</div><div class="date">04-10-02, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">been looking all over for the damnable thing... no luck.<br />
<br />
evil evil question... anyone have it transcribed? just the trap dynamics and such.<br />
<br />
im a bad person... i know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kehvrynne</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your local book/hobby store doesn't have it on the shelves, they'll be more than happy to order you a copy.<br />
<br />
You could also check out the e-stores of the major retailers.  bn.com is showing it as temporarily out of stock, but you may have better luck with amazon, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aside from traps they have a couple of neat magic items that make perfect sense but I never really bothered to think of them. Like a bridle of invisibility and horseshoes of silence.   for parking the getaway horse.</div></div><hr />
