<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tabbran</div><div class="date">02-21-02, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering if anyone's looked much into it, it's from Sword and Sorcery Studios.<br />
<br />
I've thumbed through a few books and seems like a very fun setting, but has anyone actually played it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">02-21-02, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll ask my friends from Cali what they think of it. I moved away from my gaming group, and don't get much news about stuff now. Two of my friends work at a gaming store, so I should have some opinions about it. Now, as long as I can remember to ask questions now... lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so far I've read the gazeteer (sort of the base book, details the gods and some of the cities and such), hollowfaust (awesome damn city), and parts of the creature collections. but as it is right now, their info is too spread out for me to really want to get into it..<br />
<br />
but it looks like it will become a very good setting once they get working more on the world itself, much better than the ho-hum (overpowered) fantasy fare of the forgotten realms.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tabbran</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea of the setting because the gods are right there, and insanely jealous.<br />
<br />
Flipping through the two creature collections I see that the land is filled with lots of unique and deadly creatures, on top of the standard AD&amp;amp;D ones.  Seems a more &quot;hardcore&quot; game setting than most everything else for the d20 system now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vorashus</div><div class="date">02-24-02, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My people and I have been playing in Scarred Lands for about 3 months now. I really enjoy it personally. Ive played a few games, but mostly DM. It offers a lot for a group. Id definately recommend checking it out. <br />
<br />
One thing - I normally hate pre-packaged adventures with a passion. The adventure packs for Scarred Lands, however, are awesome and really give a great feel for the setting and get your players into the right mindset for the world.<br />
<br />
Ravenloft fans might also be interested to know that the Sword and Sorcery folks are handling the 3rd Ed rules for that game. It's also very well done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">02-24-02, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the ravenloft book isn't bad, though a lot of the info was way too damn vague. I'm seeing another &quot;to conceivably run this campaign setting, you need to buy three or four books&quot; happening here.  but one thing I noticed is that they have the absolute best character race art of any book I've seen.<br />
