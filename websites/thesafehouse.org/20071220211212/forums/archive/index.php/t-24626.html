Now, the point of this thread os to raise awareness of the songs you don't really pay attention to, due to the attention usually given to the Opening/Ending (usually written/performed by somone totally different than the composer for the series). <br />

I will add more over the next few days.<br />

 <br />
Madlax - saints <br />
A haunting vocal reminicent of a choir in a large church, with a bit of a groove mixed in as the song progresses. In a series like this, where the 'insert' songs get all the attention, this piece of BGM was great enough to become the ringtone for my cell.<br />
 <br />
R.O.D. TV - Confidence<br />
With the main ROD theme appearing thruought the series remixed in various ways, and the Ending song being very easy to recall, top honors for this series go to an insert song which features a somewhat childish-sounding  singer belting out crisp vocals with an emotionally solid foundation.<br />
 <br />
Chobits - Beyond<br />
A duet between Minoru &amp; Yuzuki, this song caught my ear with its combination of piano and drum machine beat. A slow song with several harmonies, this song is great for relaxing, yet with enough of a beat to not put you to sleep.</div></div><hr />

Road to the Light is a great orchestra piece, conjuring images of a journey underway.<br />
 <br />
FFVII: Advent Children<br />
Sairin: Kata Tsubasa no Tenshi. Pretend TSO did One Winged Angel. Now rock out. This is the only version of One Winged Angel you need, period.<br />
 <br />
FLCL<br />
River's Edge is a very pretty number, with a mellow acoustic guitar backed by equally mellow keyboard and drums. Very different from most of the rock music found in the series.<br />
 <br />
GitS:SAC<br />
Where does this Ocean Go? is heard in the background, and the full song is such a great piece. Has some very good mood-setting/somewhat humorous lyrics, if you listen.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Ai Yori Aoshi<br />
Nitoba no Hana is Aoi singing a lullaby in that sultry/sexy voice of hers. No further discussion necessary.<br />
 <br />
.hack//SIGN <br />
Open Your Heart (Reprise) has a wailing saxophone, haunting choral vocals, and ending lyrics that are totally awesome. So awesome, they made it in my sig.<br />
 <br />
Honey &amp; Clover <br />
Hachimitsu is a very worthy Jpop soft rock number. I wish they would have used this as the second ending theme instead of Mistake.</div></div><hr />
