<br />
I'm talking about the thing inside the portal by the magic dealer, and the tomes tell you how to make spiffy stuff.  I've tried all sorts of things to get it to work, and I just don't seem to be able to figure it out   Llabaktharr Gigglegiggler<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hummerlein</div><div class="date">07-18-02, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">use the recipes that you get in the tomes from the quests.<br />
<br />
ie.  fire beetle belly, fenberry, endure elements</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Keyno Nokey</div><div class="date">07-18-02, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to complete the quest from the Female Magic dealer outside, collect all 5 tomes and return to her with them. Then inside there is a bookcase next to the box, that has notes with all the directions you need for each tome.. place the ingredients inside the box and cast the spell needed on the box to make the item.<br />

<br />
I was trying the mage armor one and was casting it on myself, not on the chest, which was why it didn't work.<br />
<br />
This is an awsome thing to make money with, especially if you're a caster who can cast level 3 spells for free.  I got an amulet of natural armor +3, which I'm wearing, and a couple other items that I sold for 3-5k GP.  The guy standing there sells a bunch of reagents, so you can make these things and sell 'em, even if you don't use them.<br />
<br />
Pretty spiffy!<br />
<br />
Just make sure you keep your ettercap silk glands.  I dunno what happened to mine</div></div><hr />
