<br />
VICTOR VALLEY — Following a Daily Press article, First District Supervisor Bill Postmus on Wednesday ordered county libraries to remove a Japanese comic book that contained pornographic cartoons.<br />
<br />
The book &quot;Manga: Sixty years of Japanese Comics,&quot; became the subject of controversy after Victorville resident Cynthia Jones' 16-yearold son told her the book contained illustrations of sexual acts and sex with animals. The book was found to also be available in branches located in Hesperia, Apple Valley and Barstow.<br />
<br />
Along with the order for removal of the book, Postmus also called for officials with the county library to draft a plan to protect children from similar books.<br />
<br />
&quot;This book is absolutely inappropriate for a public library and as soon as I was made aware of it, I ordered it to be removed,&quot; Postmus said.<br />
<br />
The book was on a shelf next to other comic books popular with children.<br />
<br />
Postmus, who serves as chairman of the Board of Supervisors and executive officer of the county, directed county libraries &quot;to develop a method for protecting children, by creating a method for controlling which books are available to be checked out by children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon hearing of the removal of the book, Jones said she could not believe the news.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's awesome!&quot; Jones said. &quot;I think Mr. Postmus is showing with his actions that he really cares about his community and the children.&quot;<br />
<br />
The access to X-rated material in local libraries had become an issue of concern to some elected officials who earlier in the day questioned county library policies.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am worried that they don't have an adequate screening process,&quot; Hesperia Mayor Tad Honeycutt said. &quot;I am sure there is something we can do to evaluate the content of some books.&quot;<br />
<br />
Victorville Councilman Bob Hunter said that come July 1, when the city takes over the library from the county, many policies will be changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want the city library to be a family-friendly place,&quot; Hunter said.<br />
<br />
The councilman was quick to say he does not believe in censorship of books, but was also clear to point out the need to protect underage library members from explicit content.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the city takes over we are not just going to look at books, but movies and Internet filters that could also pose the same threat,&quot; Hunter said.<br />
<br />
A visit to the local Victorville library showed that besides the book in question other materials, such R-rated movies and other explicit books are available to check out to underage patrons as young as 16.<br />
<br />
Jones said that when she started her campaign to restrict the book, she never thought the issue would be settled in such a quick manner.<br />
<br />
Calls to County Librarian Ed Kieczykowski were not returned Wednesday.<br />
<br />
Apple Valley Councilman Rick Roelle said sexually graphic material does not belong in a public library in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't have any educational value. The county should enforce the obscenity laws that we have in California,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Postmus' spokesman David Zook said the 13 copies of the book in question would be removed from all county branches, including Apple Valley, Victorville, Hesperia and Barstow.<br />
<br />
I wonder what's next on their hit list?</div></div><hr />

It does indeed have a section on 'adult' manga, complete with nudity and sex. Has a scene from Bondage Faries, iirc. Totally not something a little kid should be reading. Instead of removing it alltogether, they should have moved it into an adult section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">04-13-06, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and i suppose art books that talk about/show information about the nude human form should also be baned? what? its showing nude men and women? isn't that obscene?<br />
<br />
While some Manga do go overboard it is still an &quot;art form&quot;. Even tho few ppl admit that fact or not.<br />
<br />
Edit: and wait when was a library supposed to be a family place? i thought it was for ppl to expand their knowledge not limit it.<br />
<br />
Edit 2: Totally not something a little kid should be reading. Instead of removing it alltogether, they should have moved it into an adult section.<br />
<br />
Yes something like that but not totaly removed.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about anyone else, but I'm not sure I would want little kids innocently picking this up and saying, &quot;what is Manga?&quot; and finding this. This isn't Japan, unfortunately for some of you. As long as these types of things are handled responsibly by the library (adult section), we can avoid dumb actions from overbearing morality legislators looking for easy &quot;family value&quot; votes.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like the people close to the library (mayor, local chair) want to evaluate the content of the books and just disallow children from borrowing them.  Quite like Len suggested.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The library in my home town once had the book &quot;Firefly&quot; by Piers Anthony on the young adult bookshelves.  Anyone who's ever read this book knows that it is not even remotely a young adult book.  I told them and they moved it.<br />
 <br />
People in this country need to learn:  Just because something is &quot;cartoony&quot; doesn't mean it is for children.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">04-14-06, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:heart Firefly. I picked that up when it was new knowing how much I loved Anthony's work. Great book, but as you said NOT for his usual young audience.</div></div><hr />

It was.</div></div><hr />

(So many that you could get them confused with one another)<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm afraid to know the answer to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">04-16-06, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, on one hand it's kind of hard to give any accurate picture on manga without including the adult side of it as well. It would be like a history book completely skipping all the horribly inappropriate ideas/events like say slavery, war, torture, and of course sex.* So as a book covering what manga is it's perfectly valid and certainly has educational value. Unless you want to say that people who wish to learn about manga are not learning in any way shape or form while reading the book because there's a picture of a fictional creature having sex with a woodland creature which negates the entire rest of the book. The image of fairy sex is so powerful it consumes a person's entire brain.<br />
<br />
But on the other yeah Bondage Fairies even in one panel of one part of the book is probably not something to be kept in a section kids are allowed in. That was something that should be fixed for sure. No problems for me there in keeping it out of kids hands but I fail to see how it can be said that because the book accurately touches on manga it's without any value to a library. By the same logic no history books concerning certain ancient Greek sculptures or certain other ancient civilizations pictures should be allowed. If fairy sex is enough to put your brain into a mental loop then just imagine what a image of a faun 'frolicking' could do! I mean goat parts being inserted!!!! And lets not go into the various paintings of Leda and the Swan.<br />
<br />
<br />
*I'd actually love to see history of the world done in the ultra politically correct way. It would probably be like &quot;We can't go into how man came into existence but so far the evidence suggests man did in fact come into existence through one mean or another. blank. And 10 years ago history resumed...&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fear not your unfounded bias, in the USA, the number would be less than 1%. It's no harder to differnate between softcore porn and youth magazines than it is to differnate between manga and manga porn. This did not happen because manga has a large number of porn- it happened because there's a large number of uneducated people who are still grounded by their false belief that cartoon=children.<br />
<br />
The ones at fault here are without doubt those in charge of the library who did not bother to learn about what they are showing children before putting it out. As a matter of fact, I don't even understand why they are showing all of manga in one section still. Putting stuff like Tenjho Tenge (the uneventual unedited version, at least), Monster (a psychological serial killer series classic), and countless other adult titles in the same section as Naruto and One Piece?<br />
<br />
Manga is what it is, it's uneducated people who are ******* up.</div></div><hr />
