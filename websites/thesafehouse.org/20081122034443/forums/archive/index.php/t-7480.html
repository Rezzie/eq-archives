But how does it technicaly work? You get bumped up in levels? but do you get the powers you would of gained temporarly as well? What about xp? does that go towards your regular level? do you get it at a better rate then you xping mobs your normal level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you get bumped to a higher level<br />
<br />
you don't get any new powers<br />
you do get hps <br />
<br />
exp gain:<br />
if you kill mobs that are yellow to you in your side-kicked level, you will get exp as if you killed yellow mobs to your original level<br />
<br />
As far as I understand it, sidekicking allows everyone to group no matter what their level is and still get exp as if grouped with roughly equal level ppl. It's good to get the casual and powergamer together in one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It makes you fight at the new effective level. That is, your powers become as potent as if it were from a hero at your new level, but you don't gain any new powers/slots. (Same way you ahve a new effective level before you go to train after you level up. Power effectiveness is increased)<br />
<br />
The XP is not as good as taking mobs at your current level.<br />
<br />
Over large level differences it isn't very helpful, because you still only have the original Enhancements and such. If you took a lvl 10 person and SKed them to a 40, it would be as if a level 39 person was there, but with fewer powers and only Training Enhancements slotted in their powers. Not too horribly effective in other words. But over 5-10 levels, its probably pretty effective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The leader Sidekicks me, and it shows that I fight at lvl 18.  There are some experience hits though for everyone else when I group with them...<br />
<br />
I remember after our mission, we went back to Boomtown to work off our debt, and everyone was complaining about the crappy experience, so I dropped as a Sidekick, and everyone said the experience was great after that, yet I got no experience at all afterward..... I guess I was too low level for the group...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really liked how they handled sidekicking from the one time I tried it. It lets you group with your high level friends without it feeling like you're being powerleveled. I definately hit alot harder, etc. but the exp was the same as if I did a door mission my own level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemac Dushae</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If someone else sidekicks me, can I turn it off myself at a later time, or do they have to un-sidekick me?  I assume there is a way to do it, but I couldn't figure it out.  Got kinda irritating after the group broke up and I kept getting the &quot;I'm too far from my mentor&quot; messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both the sidekicker and sidekickee can turn off the sidekick function.<br />
<br />
Just type &quot;/unsidekick&quot; (no quotes) and you're unsidekicked</div></div><hr />
