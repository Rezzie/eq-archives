We're a social group that presents themselves pretty much like we would in a real life setting (minus dragon mounts, armor &amp; spells of course ). Basically, what you see is what you get with Areté and it's members. That being said, alot of our folks put the time in to get good gear and good crafting results...we just have fun doing it. <br />
<br />
We're on the PvE server Hilsbury our website is:<br />
