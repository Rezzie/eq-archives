<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Laan</div><div class="date">06-20-99, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hail all, I figured I'd tell you a story of my face to face encounter with the Grim Reaper himself. <br />
 <br />
 One day, I finally decided to leave my home of Qeynos, (I am a 13th Circle Human rogue), so I headed over to Freeport. The trip was long and fun, and I made it without a scratch. When I got there though, I didn't have any clue where to go. So after payin a fizzler to make Freeport my home town, I backtrack to East Commons to see what I could hunt. I wanderered along the south desert wall a little, and came up to a giant rattlesnake. <br />
 <br />
 The snake decided to slither right between my legs, (the nerve), so I decided it needed some ventilation in it's back.. A short battle commenced, and the snake was slain. Unfortunately, I was heavily beaten, and poisoned. Now this poison is evil stuff.. it just ate away at my well being. Eventually, I passed out from it, and had a kind of out of body experience. <br />
 <br />
 As my body slowly withered away, I kept getting closer and closer to a dark light. (I was banned from the bright one). I just watched in horror as I got dragged closer and closer to the light, my body going through it's death throes. Right when I was inches from the light, my body relaxed, as the poison wore off. Now the snake had only given me small bites, so I wasn't bleeding to death. Slowly but surely, I recovered, eventually regained conciousness, and crawled into a corner and licked my wounds. That is the closest I've ever been to death. <br />
 <br />
 OOC: I hit -10 hp when poison wore off.. still not sure why I didn't bleed to death though.. <br />

 Actors: 14th level Dark elf rogue (me) <br />
 Ogre warrior (possibly Ogos) <br />
 Lizardman warrior <br />
 <br />
 Location: Small bridge that leads to the lizardmen pyramids in Feerrott <br />
 <br />
 Story: Having fought a lizardman train with my ogre companion, we were down to one lizardman left and both the lizardman and I were at death's door. The lizardman got in one more mighty blow that actually knocked me unconscious and off the small bridge into the river. Fortunately, my ogre friend managed to distract the lizardman and kill him before he jumped into the river to finish me off. <br />
 Unfortunately, I was now sinking into the river unconscious. I regained consciousness and managed to surface right before I ran out of breath. I am sure even one of the drowning gasps would have been my last. The adrenaline rush from surviving that one was just undescribable. <br />

A fleeing spider let me through an illusionary wall, where I finished it quick and easy. I decided to explore a bit. Came across a named NPC, and thought I would hail him. He turned, and cast charm person on me. Now this is when it gets interesting. I am forced to wander around. Boy, was I lost. Had no control. Then, I jump into the water and swim into a tunnel....then i stop at exactly midpoint. What a sick demented AI! I loved the genius of the computer, even though I knew I was going to die. <br />
 The breath meter started counting down, and finally i was out of air. As soon as I took drowning damage, the charm person broke. Unfortunately, at that time, I had not mastered swimming moves, and drowned. <br />

 <br />
 It was quite some time ago, so I don't remember all the details. But basically the short versoin is this. <br />
 <br />
 I was fighting in Crushbone in my youth and took a moment to rest near the entrance. Well, someone shouts &quot;Train to zone!&quot; and instead of zoning, being the curious Rogue I am...I move to where I could have a look see. This huge train barrels through, and I turn to run. But as soon as the engine zoned, they all turned on me... I was getting stunned and whaced at from all directions as I inched towards the zone line. <br />
 <br />
 A-l-m-o-s-t there!.. Then with one more hit from a Legionnaire I fall unconcious. But Brell was with me for as I fell I zoned!! It was incredible. When I came through the zone I was still unconscious but revived soon after. I WISH I had the presence of mind to take a screen shot. <br />

 I was fighting in Qeynos Hills against a rabid wolf. The wolf diseased me and was about to kill me when I started to run. My shouts for help were answered and someone came to my rescue. As I ran, I was knocked unconscious right before the wolf was slain. This must be a bug or something, but my corpse continued to run after i was knocked unconscious. So my unconscious body was sliding across the hills at a decent pace. I figured I would eventually regain consciousness, so I let my corpse run along the ground. It was kind of amusing to watch.. when it finally hit the wall, it continued to slide along it.. After a VERY long wait for me to regain consciousness, I realized that my meter wasnt going up because of my disease. I couldnt ask anyone to cure it because you cant talk when you are unconscious.. :( .. I thought that I would be stuck like that forever. Luckily, after about 2 minutes, I respawned at my home point. There must be some sort of time limit for how long you can be unconscious for. <br />
 <br />
 Even though I lost the exp, it was better than being stuck unconscious for the rest of my life.. <br />

I got hit by a goblin scout as I turned to run. I got knocked unconcious and just started sliding along. The goblin contined to hit me now and then(I don't think it followed me. The server must've thought I was still there) Eventually someone came along and killed it. I regained conciousness and then tried to figure out where the heck I slid too. :)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 I was fighting an aviak chick in Butcherblok and it was a dead even match. We were taking each other down at almost exactly the same rate. This was one of those fights that you couldn't stand to watch... cause 1 blow would decide the outcome. <br />
 <br />
 So we're pluggin away at each other, both near death when BAM... he knocks me down... unconscious. <br />
 <br />
 I figured it was all over until I saw my unconscious body get up and stab the sucker in the gut. The aviak then fell over dead... and I was alive with 0 HP.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 While sitting there, I switched to the windowed mode (non-full screen) to watch the actual numbers ticking off instead of watching the health bar. (it's hard to see the colors when they're really low) <br />
 <br />
 So, I watched the numbers tick down, at zero I went unconscious, and it kept going...to -7. Then, it said the poison has run it's course and the health points miraculously began to climb. Needless to say, I was pretty happy. <br />

I was below 0 health when the strong poison wore off, and then slowly regained consciouness. But then an orc pawn came over and killed me. Heheh... let that be a lesson. When you sit down... agressive green things will attack you. I was level 13 at the time... and died to a pawn. Heheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rith</div><div class="date">06-26-99, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was a young rogue of the 13th ranking, and was very near being upped to the 14th, so I was a little careless. I was sponging exp off of a 14 paladin and a 14 ranger. They decided to try to get a trainer shield, while I wandered looking for blue stuff to kill(not smart for a rogue). I was fighting a blue near the zone border, I got it down to running hp, about a little sliver of hp,while I had about 3hp left. Far too weak to give chase, so I sat down. There happened to be a little green standing there looking mean with his orcish axe, and he decided to take a swing at me. He got lucky on the first hit, and brought me down to negative life. After a 45 seconds or so I saw my factions change and I gained exp., meaning someone took out the blue orc. Meanwhile, due to my high agi, dodge, and parry(how I could dodge and parry while knocked out is beyond me) he couldn't hit me. So my life slowly lurched up to 1, then the little bugger hit me again, taking me down to negative again. This happened for about...5 minutes, I could hear my group laughing, but I couldn't do anything about it. I saw a fizzler walk past me once just watching, not helping at all. Finaly when I got up to 1hp again I jumped into the zone border, barely escaping the evil pawn.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
 I was running from Feerrott to Arena to get bound (I was bound in greater faydark at the moment), and when I zoned into Lake Rathetear, I saw a named froglok called Prince Kyrmt Keroppi. Con - blue, scowl (helped many people camp the ghoulbane, froggies gate me with a passion). I decide what the hell, I have valor and sow on, and zone line is in sight, and attack. First sign of trouble - you are pierced by thorns! But I continue fighting... both of us are losing health at about the same rate, finally darkness goes off and I run around in circles plunking him with bow (I had about a bar and a half of health left at the moment, he was a little higher), arrows and darkness evened it out a little, then darkness ended and I had to engage in melee again... I was down to half a bar of health, he had just about nothing and then... <br />
  <br />
 You pierce Prince Kyrmt Keroppi for 2 points of damage! <br />
 You are pierced by thorns! <br />
 Prince Kyrmt Keroppi hits YOU for 62 points of damage! <br />
 You have been knocked unconcious! <br />
 You gain experience! <br />
 You have slain Prince Kyrmt Keroppi! <br />
  <br />
 I had about 2 bars of unconcious health left... closest I have ever came to dying after zoning out from a huge train with 1hp left. <br />

 Did he have any of the goods on him? <br />

 And you mean Froglok's don't scowl at everyone?  They certainly do all Ogres and Trolls.  I guess over the years the big uglies have 'bashed' them too much for forgiveness... <br />

 Oh, and he didn't have anything special on him, just 1pp and some change. <br />

 I was on my way to qeynos, in the kerranas, when i see someone training a griffawn. I have a sow so I fallow and start plinken it with arrows, and an ocasional backstab each one costing me at least 60 hp. The guy it is chasing vanishes, so now i am running. running backwars shootin it, have it down to a sliver, and a griffin joins in, but i continue to plink the grifawn with arrows hopeing to get the exp before i have to run to the zone. then I back into a giant and get hit for a few hundred pts, so i forget about killin the thing and run. Have no idea where i am or where a zone is and am bound in freeport so i am scared. So i just run stait hoping for a zone...sow fades giant hits foe 60 pts,,,down to a sliver, dam,,,zone yipppie,,, <br />
 I zoned into the same zone i was in, at at the point i first entered, and have full health, with sow and buffs back. <br />

So I run over, hit it with Tashani (Unresistable Magic REsistance debuff), then I through my DoT on it because I know those stick pretty good. Well, those both make it, so I decide, what the hey, and I throw my DD on it, resisted, another, resisted. Uh oh, the Cyclopse is now out for my blood. So I am running away, my pet is beating on it, and it is beating me to a bloody pulp. So seeing as how it is almost dead, I decide, to Hades with it. I stop and start casting my DD... <br />

 You are knocked Unconcious <br />
 You regain your concentration and continue casting your spell <br />

No such luck D'vinn spouts something about killing all woodelves and backstabs me for 47 and stabs me twice.  I make a mad dash for the safety of Faydark with him hitting me in the back from time to time on the way. In the tunnel he stabs me in the leg and I start to limp. As I approach the zone line I am slowing to a crawl, I know there is no way I will make it in time but I keep crawling anyway... D'vinn hits me a final time and I fall, I figure oh well I died again.

  <br />
 I am a monk of the 20th Order. I love to group with rogues though. On Quellious there is a rogue called Winestab (!!!)...He is now lvl 23 I think. At llvl 14, we used to group a lot for the dervs in WCommons. By god, the little guy will be prancing around the dervs and backstabbing them all the time..!!! <br />
  <br />
 Anyway, my closest exp with the death thing was at lvl 17 in a full group in Befallen. We had 2 paladins, me a monk, and 3 casters. Hmm..I am tanking this evil thing which was basically wiping the floor with me when we hav two more of its pals join in. The casters blast the new monsters, while I was holding our first guuest. I Mend, fight on..The monster gets a dual weild/double attack in (Sigh..4 hits of 25 each or so!). I am unconscious and bleeding to death, Tada, I feel a &quot;healing &quot; touch. WOW. I am up and hitting it again..The casters are OOM. The monster ignores the paladins and comes for me! Very soon, I am unconscious again!$#$#$#e. Again, the second paladin uses lay hands on me! We finally killed the baddy. <br />
  <br />
 And, this is the great part..That was the first time I had grouped with those paladins..!! Very dew paladins I know of use layhands on others, especially in the heat of battle! <br />
 Compare this to some clerics I know who spend all mana nuking the MOB:( <br />

Well, we were having a rough day (died many a time, but lost hardly any exp) and got in yet another fight with a few legos.  One of us died, one of us came through without a scratch, but Eiche and I were torn up pretty bad.  I zoned with about 20hp, but Eiche zoned, and was knocked unconscious on the other side.  The fact that it let him zone and then knocked him out isn't the crazy part.  He zoned and was dropped in the middle of Greater Faydark, still knocked out, and finally wondered his way out to the POD lift.  He's not the only person this happened to either. There was another fighting in CB at the same time, but when he zoned, he dropped in the same spot, but was inflicted with damage form the fall.

I'm level 16 and grouped with a level 18 warrior.  We make it HH fine, find someone to bind us there, and they ask us to join them in ridding the world of some orcs.  We join forces and take on the orcs.  Had to zone three or four times from huge groups of orcs but the last time this one orc is just smashing our little healer.  I jump him from behind and of course he turns his attention to me.  The healer and I run for the zone and make it.  I'm sitting there thinking &quot;Thanks to Tunare that we made the zone&quot;.  After the please wait message leaves I see something to the effect of &quot;player has entered under the world, reassigning position.&quot;  Next thing I know I'm standing in the middle of Kithicor Forest looking at the direction marker wonder where the heck I am.

I'm running for my life to the zone, getting pounded, life bar sliding away.  I'm about unconscious when I make it to the zone.   Everytime that situation happens, I wonder how much life I actually have left on the other side, because for some reason they seem to hit you some extra bits after you've left.  Well, that time I should've been dead, because SPLASH, into the drink of Dagnor's Cauldron I was, somewhere, I swear, inside the ground, at least it looked that way, with a few HP left.  Well, I got myself to the NPC camp and rested, my paladin friend resting over at the Unrest entrance with the other victims. <br />
  <br />
 Other time was when I was trying to take out DVinn with barely any help.  Pushed it very, quite very to the limit and zoned.  Appeared somewhere under Kelethin, with a few HP left, just like before.  Well, I stayed there and worked on my bind wounds, a new talent I thought was time to raise, when I hear this crunch.  Someone of high level fell out of Kelethin and landed right behind me but had a few hit points left.  More skill raising for me.

This is how it works - you are in one of those life or death races to the zone line.  You are getting rooted/stunned/blown up/hacked to pieces right at the zone line.  With nothing left, down to that nasty crossed-out name display of your health, you cross!  Then, you appear, NOT at the zone line byt somewhere in the middle of the zone, with full health and (when applicable) no mana.  My theory - you died INSIDE the zone line, and the AI just freaked out and stuck you somewhere handy. Or maybe Bristlebain really does reward the tricky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jarondel</div><div class="date">11-21-99, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was playing in Crushbone as I was want to do from about 7 to 17 when at the level of 13 the Infamous &quot;D'Vinn to Zone&quot; shout arrives on my box. I had been fighting Legs so I was taking a pretty good pounding and was &quot;resting&quot; at the CB side of the zone. I decided that the better part of valor was to high tail it to the other or SAFE side of the zone. I zone without problem and being down to about half a bub of HP I decide that it is time to Real World eat.  <br />
  <br />
 I Know that it will take forever to regenerate my large roguely number of HP so I think this will be the perfect opportunity to get that EtOH Tolerance up at the same time. I start in on the short beers. Approximately 7 or 8 of the short brews later my INT is about 20 and I am looking at a sliver of recognizable landscape surrounded by a streaking of surroundings. I sit and Hide, but the hide will not work because I am weaving approximately 30 feet as I sit.  <br />
  <br />
 I decided that at level 13 nothing outside of Crushbone can hurt me so I get up and get some food. I watch a bit of TV and fix a magnificent sandwich accompanied by chips and salsa. Yes I am a Southwestern Boy at heart if not presently in geography.  <br />
  <br />
 After about 30 minutes I remember that I am sitting in the Crushbone entrance and figure that I will be Normal/Normal Hp/INT. Much to my surprise, when I get to my screen, I am looking at the back of a Guards legs.  <br />
  <br />
 Interesting, I think, then I stand and actually sit down. Now How did that happen? I quickly realize that I am not in the Crushbone entrance anymore but at my &quot;gate&quot; point at the orc lift. Also the You are hungry/thirsty message is platered on my screen from top to bottem, interspersed with the occasional Faydark /auction.  <br />
  <br />
 I scroll up and low and behold my entire screen is red with 'an orc centurion trys to hit you but misses&quot; with the occsional Hits you for 2 or 3 points. As I inquire further I see the ever telling &quot;you are knocked unconscious&quot; along with the heralded &quot;you regain consciousness&quot; only to be knocked down again. This occurred 7 times on my screen with about 100 misses or hits for 3 hp messages interspersed. It took up the entire scroll. I have no idea how long the orc or orcs had been hitting me or trying to hit me but by scrolling up, I had proof that I had been knocked unconscious at LEAST 7 times. Finally being dealt the death blow by a lucky hit of 4 hp. Loading, Please wait..... <br />
  <br />
 Being killed by a Cent at 13 is bad enough, but to have this happen was horrible. The worst part was that I know at least 30 people were zoning in and out of Crush that night, and at least on my scope, non helped me. I deserve it. Nothing is free unless you pick it yourself. haha But the good news is that my EtOH tolerance increase to 12 that night. Alas all was not lost.  <br />

I was in hide/sneak mode with a SOW on me so that I wouldn't move too slowly and was doing alright.  Then all of a sudden I heard &quot;Minotaur train!&quot;  Smugly I continued on my way not paying attention since the mino couldn't see me anyway.  THen all of a sudden I am getting hit for 63 points of damage.  I guess Bristlbane wanted to punish me, he is a bit fickle, for my arrogance.  I am too far from the cave opening and was getting hit to hard and i knew I was done for.  As I lay there gasping for breath (still looking beautiful I might add) I prayed one last time and prepared for the afterlife.  Then I heard the sound of a sword being drawn and flesh splitting apart.  I lifted my weak head and saw this valiant little dwarf battling the mino.  Soon the dwarf was surrounded with finger wagglers (still to this day can't understand why he chose to go with them casters) and they dispatched the mino into the fiery inferno of the underworld.  I was soon surrounded with a blue haze (ok ok casters have their good points) and was restored to full health.  *smiles* And that dwarf and I have been happily married for three years now :) <br />

  <br />
 My tale might not be as adventerous as other people but this is my closest to deat h experience. <br />
  <br />
 One day I was chasing some rogue clockworks when I was 10-11 summers old. I am a dwarven rogue who was trying to get more popular with the gnomes. I was just looking around when I saw a young Highelf wizard fighting a gnome skeleton, he looked weak but his magic was strong and didn't seem to worried. After whatching him figting the skeleton, a plague rat joined the fight..I would have some trouble with the skeleton, but the rat seemed no problem to me......He yelled for help and because I don't like those deseased things and skeletons I swiftly backstabbed the rat. The Rat Much bigger and stonger than I anticipated, casted some plague spell on me. That meant trouble....The wizard killed the skeleton and turned around to help me.  While gathering some space so he could cast he backed up towards two Kobolds !, Already hurt from the last battle he didn't last long.. poor lad.... I never knew his name.  Luckily the kobolds didn't have any grudge towards me and left me alone. But the rat was too tough...Much too tough..so to my shame I ran.. the guards were too far away so I ran toward the pass of faydark, I knew the rat wouldn't follow me there.. The rat was quick on his feet and manage to bite me and cast a plague spell so many times I thought I would never make it...But I did..with a mimimum of health left(half a bar)..I quickly took out to bandage myself and felt better, but everytime I bandege myself the plague took its toll and my wounds became worse.  <br />
 Knowing that I would lose consiousness if i wouldn't bandage myself I kept bandaging.(I gained by bandaging about 1/4 a bar but lost a little more by the plageu spell)  My life decreased even more and more over time, It seemed to be a loosing battle. finally when the plague brought me down to a minimum (1/10th of health orso) and the bandaging wouldn't help me anymore, I overcame the plague....weak as I was I cheered..Then I discovered that I just used the last bandage, if the plague had lasted a little longer or if I had less bandages I would have been a dead dwarf ! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">11-29-99, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one of these to tell myself. <br />
  <br />
 The other night some of my friends and I went out to Gargoyle island in the Ocean of Tears. The place was camped, and not spawning Gargoyles like it used to in the days of yore, so we decided to head over to the Oracle Island to slaughter some goblins. <br />
  <br />
 The group consisted of Myself, a 20th level wizard, a 20th level Magician, an 18th level Shaman, and a 22nd level Cleric. <br />
  <br />
 Well about halfway through the night we had a bad pull and ended up with the Island goblin Headmaster on us. Not a problem, I thought, as we have taken him before. <br />
  <br />
 As it turned out however, we ended up with a much higher spawn than last time, and all of the casters spells were being resisted. In the meantime I was getting double attacked for 54. Now earlier in the night a high level Druid had seen fit to cast a Skin like Nature spell on me (Which for those that don't know is the ULTIMATE hit point buff with a minor regen effect). Now we are fighting this goblin, but it turns out that I am the only thing capable of taking it. So the Wizard and Magician back off and start using bandages on me. The cleric and shaman started using their heals on me as well. I got hit, knocked unconcious, got back up with 120 hit points. Got knocked unconcious again, got back up with 110 hit points, got knocked unconcious again. I was knocked unconcious about 8 times during the fight. <br />
  <br />
 But we won! =) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Krieger</div><div class="date">11-30-99, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One fine day when I was a newbie rogue (about 4th shadow) I was trotting along the road from me home in kaladim to the green forests of Gfay.  I had gotten a message from me close friend Marbain the Magnificent who requested my help at orc hill.  Though we were both only level 4 we had a older dwarven guildbrother who was a level 9 cleric.  I immediately agreed as I was ready for some action.  I zoned into gfay and was on me way to the hill when I heard a scream to my left.  I turned and saw a young female half-elf frantically trying to escape a wandering orc cent who was beating the ever-living elf out of her. I immediately hitched up me patchwork pants settled me scarab helm and readied me rusty spear then I charged.  The orc sensing my approach changed targets and started pounding on me while I kept missing him.  The half-elf girl ran away and I was glad that she would survive.  I could feel the blood flowing freely from the many wounds the orc was inflicting on me and knew I would soon see Death.  Falling back beneath the massive heel of the cent I prepared me death chant and had just opened me mouth to sing it when I was knocked unconscious. Death be not proud.  As I started to float away towards that trap-filled, lots of locks to pick, poison never fails, pick pocketing always works and you never die Heaven in the sky, I saw a small figure hurry to me side.  I knew there was no hope so I closed me eyes and readied for ... &quot;You are conscious&quot;  It was me dwarven cleric friend!  He spent his precious energy on healing my wounds until it was like I had never been wounded at all!  Truly Rodcet Nife is a wonderous God to allow such power.  The orc cent that had nearly sent me to me reward was promptly dispatched by his companion and they looted it.  I drew in a weary breath and limped to the area by the guards.  I sat there for awhile and pondered if I truly wanted to try me wits against an orc again.  True me friend wanted me but surely if he had nearly died like I had he would think twice about fighting them.  So when the time came and Marbain stood before me waiting for me to follow I did what any other rogue would do ... hitched up me torn patchwork pants settled me scratched scarab helm readied me rusty spear and away we went! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shirl</div><div class="date">12-10-99, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had been sneaking and peeking in and around Crushbone with little luck. Couldn't find a group, and all the centurions were looking a bit tough to me, so I left and headed for Orc Hill.  <br />
    On the way I spotted a centurion who didn't look too tough, so I lit into him, and pouned him but good. Just as it looked like he was going to go down, his brother showed up. No need to start worrying, I figured I'd be able to knock the first one off and then handle the second one since he didn't look very tough either. <br />
    Just as the first orc turned tail and ran, two more jumped me from behind. 'Time to beat feet' I told myself, and made the dash to the summit of Orc Hill figuring I'd find some able bodied help there. I mean, there' ALWAYS someone there, right? ALWAYS! <br />
  <br />
 Not tonight there wasn't. Not a soul, and poor me now being chased by 4 centurions (#1 had gotten his courage back and rejoined the fight). <br />
  <br />
 Better to die fighting - and where I know I can find my corpse, then fleeing through some dark, mist shrouded forest, so I turned and fought. Oh brother did I fight, but there were to many of them, and I thought I was a goner. Just as I felt my fell into uncosciousness a passing do gooder joined the fray, and healed me enough to get me back on my feet.  <br />
 And so I fought on. <br />
  <br />
 We knocked off two of the orcs, but down I went again, and again he healed me before I could bleed to death, so back into the melee I went. It was glorious, but it wasn't over yet. <br />
  <br />
 Some poor fellow who would have been safer hunting spiders and bats came charging up the hill with a train of 4 more centurions behind him. Try as he might, my companion was unable to save him from death, and as soon as the poor fellow died his brutish followers turned their unwanted attentions on us.  <br />
  <br />
 I went down for a third time, and was certain that this sealed an unhappy fate for your's truly, but lo, once more my unknown companion juiced me up again, and we fought on. In short order we killed off the last two of the original 4 centurions that had jumped me, and then turned on the 4 Grishnak-come-latelies. <br />
  <br />
 I took out one of those 4 without further help, but since he had his entire neighborhood on his side, I was taken down again (the 4th time), and thought for sure that this was it.  <br />
  <br />
 Nope, I was healed one last time, and it lasted long enough for the two of us to finish off the last of the orcs. When the fight was finally over I had 3- THREE!!! Hit points left, and had been below zero 4 times!!!  <br />
  <br />
 I don't know who my benefactor was that night, he left when the fight ended, but if I ever find him again, I'm gonna make him my new best friend. <br />
  <br />
 So, if you happen to read this, whoever you were that night on Orc Hill, Mithanial Marr, two nights ago (wed 12/7) and remember that fight, contact me, I have to thank you. <br />
  <br />
 Four times unconscious in one long, brawling, unbelievable fight.  I don't know if that's a record for anyone else, but is sure is for me.</div></div><hr />

 Me and Kulwaen and Nikilis are in a heavy fight with Lord darvish, Royal Gaurd and Emperor crush on the stairs in the castle tower in CB, when one stupid low level dwarf came running in from the throne room with a train of legs/oracles/and emmissaries (He thought us 'high' lvlers could save him.  Well things turned ugly.. I barely survived, as did Nikilis, but during the fight Kul was going down... I fought bravely to get to him to taunt the Orc away, but the room was too crowded, and Kulwaen fell.  The Orc somehow managed to find new prey.  The fight raged on when Kulwaen unconsious body started crying 'help'  I had to look twice as I thought he was dead.  <br />
 'Help im unconsious' the inert form of Kulwaen cried... its hard to fight when your laughing loudly to your enemies.  <br />
 Needless to say he was soon bandaged up and rearing to go.  <br />
 The dwarf managed to survive too.. which was lucky... I was about to flame him for his stupidness, and my wrath must has been great indeed, for the silly little dwarf backed off from me and  fell out of the window in the tower and died.  <br />

I love this thread.  How about the LONGEST you've been unconcious without dying?  I was attacking people at random in the Qeynos area of Vallon Zek,  not killing anyone,  but just attacking and playing hide and seek in town.  Well one guy 8 levels above me decided he was too annoyed,  rooted me and blasted me unconcious.  Rather then kill me though he just kept punching me for one point of damage over and over and over.  The only thing you can do unconcious of course is talk  so after 7 minutes of this I typed /quit  and logged out for a bit.  Turns out he kept up the punching so long while I was linkdead that I disapeared before he could actually kill me.  whoop!</div></div><hr />

 Pren actions, &quot;Buying Greater lightstones, 7pp each.&quot; <br />
  <br />
 I've been buying tons of GLSs, and killing as many wisps as possible. However, since I'm used to being my lvl20 monk, I forget that a wisp can kick my ass. Someone who was gathering GLSs for me tells me there was a large respawn of wisps east of the tollbooth. I turn around and see him down the hill attacking a wisp, and 2 wisps going off in other directions. I leap on one and start pummeling it. It's doing ALOT of damage to me, and I only had 4 bubbles to start with. Down to 2 bubbles, a second wisp joins in. Mend.. <br />
  <br />
 You have worsened your wounds! (Oh sh!t...) <br />
 I turn to run and get stunned twice in a row, seeing a nice panaramic view while the wisps beat my ass into the ground. <br />
  <br />
 I take off running, giving some /y's. I get missed _12_ times in a row by the wisps (with 63 agility!!!) I run past the other guy, and the wisp he has near dead *aggros on ME*. So here I am, running to the EC zone, with 3 wisps, a necro, and his pet in tow. The wisps constantly are missing me, and only hitting for 1 damage. Almost to the zone, a wisp dies. The two open a can on me (Ok, so they hit me for 11 and 13) dropping me down to practically nothing. I hit my 3 hotkey (personna), and see 17 hps left as I hit the zone line. When I finish zoning, i've got 0 stamina (alot of jumping), and 6 hps. <br />
  <br />
 Regretably, the 2 wisps turned and killed the necro. He got stunlocked and died very close to the zone, apparently. <br />
  <br />
 Why did I not die? How could I run 1/4th of the zone with 1/2 a bubble of hps? <br />
  <br />
 A druid was hunting guards at the tollbooth, so he sow'd everyone there. Since the guards don't attack wisps, I would have died had he not decided to kill the guards there. Heh, sometimes the druids really do help more than the guards. Thanks Dolt ;) <br />

   <br />
 Place: Cazic Thule, Pyramid  <br />
 Who: Ozaak Kaazo level 31 dwarf rogue, Sibbis Smibbish level 32 barbarian shaman, Yllems Gnud level 30 halfing warrior <br />
   <br />
 We were doing really good, cleaned out the lower level quite nicely, no problem.  Getting ready to pull the 3 from the top which are a bit harder, especially with a smaller group.  Yllems says he has to go eat dinner real quick, so we wait for him.  I'm the impatient type so as soon as he comes back, we pull the top.  <br />
   <br />
 Right into the middle of a spawn.  Two extra protectors.  We try it anyway.  Sow blinks.  Yell for the shaman to run, but he just runs around trying to get a sow off, he has a tendency to do stupid, brave things like that when he has the most xp.  Sow leaves, shaman dies.  Start running.  Not too bad, luckily the warrior is getting most of the hits, and he can handle it.  Get to the door outside the courtyard, mess up opening it and get caught in the door.  Have to open and close it, now they're hitting on me.  I can't handle it.  Half way through the courtyard my health bar turns purple and I'm looking at my body on the ground, some wierd view bug.  All the sudden I'm off and running again.  Shaman's health bar starts dropping like a rock.  We both make it, barely.  <br />
   <br />
 Yup, shaman died, was bound in CY, immediantly memmed heal, got it off JUST in time and tanked the mobs while completely neked while we zoned. &lt;u&gt;Ozaak Kaazo******** *******************************&lt;/u&gt;<br />

<br />
A bunch of elves were camping the bank in Kelethin when this poor Gnome decided to do deposit her loot.  They rooted her and all started hitting on her.  She was very patient, closed her bank account, /tapped her foot, and as soon as the root broke ran out the door and off the edge of the platform.<br />
<br />
The bank in Kelethin is quite high up--third level?--and even her Rogueish Safefall didn't save her.  She died, but at least she wasn't PKed.<br />
<br />
Then the strange part.  The entire server crashed.  When it finally goes back up she logs on and finds that her last save point was in mid-air!  So she only falls for half the distance, hits the ground, and runs off to recuperate.  No death at all.<br />
<br />
If only we could arrange these convenient all-server crashes more often.<br />

I was my shadowknight when this all took place.    I just got through banking in freeport and decided to go out of the city, but decided to go through the city.  The path I took i've taken a million times, but this one time, someone KOS to me started attacking and casting spells on me, and being only lvl 7 that was really scary.  I started to run and started slowing down from all the damage I was taking, but kept going cause I could see the zone area.  Right before I zoned though, YOU have been knocked unconscous, YOU are bleeding to death... and then to my amazment, LOADING PLEASE WAIT...  As soon as I loaded in I had half a bub of life and was no longer dying.<br />

Grouped outside Paw last night with a ranger, cleric, druid and rogue (me).  The ranger pulls 3 gnolls at once.  ( runner was passing by and decided to join in the fun).  Ranger zones into paw.  We're all taking a pretty good beating.  Sddenly there is a second druid in group.  I'm down to 2 bubbles of health.  &quot;Run for the zone&quot;.  I reply, &quot;no sow&quot;.  Everyone was really low health at that point so I didn't feel comfortable trying to evade.  I'm running for the zone with 2 gnolls on my tail.  Under a bubble now and knowing I'm not going to make it, I whisper up a prayer to Tunare.  Then I see it.  That beautiful blue light.  One of the druid hit me with sow at last possible moment.  I zip into the tunnel and thru the zone.  Didn't even check to see how many hit points I had left when I got through.  Just started bandaging and of course, thanking that druid profusely.<br />

<br />
I was fighting in HH Pass last night with a small group.  We were the only group fighting Orcs so no competition.  Well, no competition means things can get a little out of hand every once in awhile.  We take down half a train and see 3 more orcs joining the fight, so I call for everyone to zone.<br />
<br />
I land one more backstab to get a mercenary off our cleric and head for the zone.  I see my health dropping steadily and it's nearly gone when I get to the zone.  Unfortunately I took one more hit and got knocked unconscious... Fortunately I fell into the zone.  After what seemed like an eternity I finished zoning to the welcome message of:<br />
<br />
&quot;Player is beneath world, moving to a safe location&quot;.  Safe location is subjective, I guess, but I landed about a 30 second run from the zone to Rivervale.  In Kithcor.  At night.  So I have 11 hitpoints, and all my buffs somehow disappeared even though I didn't die.  I make it to the rivervale zone and start bandaging myself...<br />
<br />
So my closest?  Knocked unconscious, fell into zone, woke up with a few hitpoints left in a high level undead-controlled zone (:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Houma</div><div class="date">07-13-00, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea Kezzek, and I think I have a pair of stories worth adding.<br />
Many of you might have heard something about me, the crazy Darkie who decided to get a Burning Rapier before he gets a last name.  The quest ineveitably brings me to Blackborrow.  And ineveitably I learn to hate the brewers, but being there does allow me to make plenty of jokes about the bad smell coming from the Barbarians.  Anyway, sitting there and waiting for a brewer to show up is boring, so I run into the commander room and kill him every few minutes, and then run up to the ledge above it and kill all the gnolls there.  One time after a particularly brutal fight with the commander I ran into three Elite Guardsmen up on the ridge.  No chance to back down so I fight.  One goes down, I am severly wounded.  Another falls and the thrid pounds me hard.  Then out of no where his eyes go wide as a blue aura surrounds me and heals all my wounds.  This one is not very brave and runs near the end of the fight and I promptly kill him in one swipe.  Out of nowhere I am hit in the back of the head.  Somehow another Elite made it up there and he hit me hard.  Down he goes and yet another arrives.  I am hurting and almost dead, victory in the vile things eyes when yet again a blue aura surrounds me.  I don't even give this one a chance to run.  I turn around to find my benefactor and I see a... WOLF!  I bow low to him, wondering why he would help my dark kind out and he speaks the words, &quot;Houma, I have heard of your goodness and this valient quest you are on.  I have helped but a little and only a little more can I do. Here.&quot; and I feel much much faster.  After riffleing through the fur of the unfortunates I through them into the water, keeping one of their skins.  I run down for my rendevous with the Brewer and he has the tenacity to jump on me!  Promptly he is killed, and alas, still no cask.<br />
<br />
Later that evening I was awaiting the arrival of the Master Brewer, having sent all of his underlings to the Abyss, when I hear a someones voice yelling &quot;TRAIN!&quot;  Knowing that they mean that a whole bunch of the ugly things were following them outside I promptly get into a corner and hide.  Watching them go past I wait for the gnoll commander and pick him out.  Low and behold another commander attacks me at the same time.  I slay both and sit down to rest.  I am feeling good about myself when an elite walks by and myself never passing up an opportunity I jump out of the shadows and place a nice hole in his backside.  Little did I know that this was the lead of the &quot;train&quot; that upon having lost both their commanders had decided to return to their posts.  Two of his companions joined him and the rest of the vile gnolls decided to cheer their comrades on.  I dropped the one and ran.  Near the entrance, never being one to back down from a fight I turn and dispatch andother Elite.  As the last one comes in, the smaller prey had fled away from me.  Praying to  Bristlebane to guide me in the hereafter I stab one last time and do a backflip.  Being the smart one I am I heard the gnoll fall but also I heard my own body hit the ground snf move half an inch backwards.  Then from the gods these words appear in my mind &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.&quot;  I have often noticed this in passing between territories and had just happened to be in the right place at the right time I guess.<br />
<br />
OOC: Both true though the druid had played another character I had helped out, he didn't say all that.  It was late at night when only about fifteen people were actually there.  And no... I still have not gotten my cask yet... stupid spawn rates.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mankarr</div><div class="date">07-17-00, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, let's see... I have had several. One of my most notable was soloing Kizdean Gix, at 27 yesterday. I conned him and it said that he might pose a problem. So I snuck up behind him and backstabbed him and started meleeing. As the fight went on he got off 2 or 3 fears on me. I only feared him once. Long fight. It was real close right from the beginning. I mean it was exact amount of hitpoints graphically. I get down to a bubble, he is too, I start yelling for help. No help, thought about running, then threw that thought out and just kept fighting him. I had my SBD main hand and my new BR I just got two days ago (yay!) offhand. Finally my SBD proc sticked. He resisted two times earlier. Swapped my BR main hand. Melee'd him some more. I'm down to a quarter bubble. Double attacked, dual wielded him for about 40 damage total, got him down to a sliver of life. WHAM! He doubled on me, just knocked me unconscious. Darn! I thought. Started to cast a spell, I resisted his fear. I was going, what the heck? Fearing me while I'm unconscious? Haha! Bash! Ow, that hurt. Bashed me for 1. The killing blow... Kizdean Gix dies. Woohoo! I won... uh oh... is that a bear I hear? Please get up get up. You regain consciousness! You have hidden yourself from view. I turn around, a young kodiak was right behind me, right in aggro range if I wasn't hidden that is. Walks on by while I bandage myself.<br />
<br />
Another was in MM, some guy was fighting an enchanter in the tower thing I believe. I saw a 21 rogue backstab the guy while he was fighting. I was thinking, dueling at that place? Huh? Something or other begins to cast a spell. You are stunned! I was sitting down hidden waiting for full hp to take out an initiate. I was at 4 bubbles, get hit down to 2 bubbles in a few seconds, I'm charmed! I'm running around chasing some guy trying to stab him. Finally he zones, and I'm near the tunnel heading to the graveyard. I was thinking, okay once this charm breaks I've gotta be ready. Wait for a long while, charm breaks, I'm spinning in circles, get hit down to half a bubble while I am, speed strafe the heck to zone. I take the shortcut over the hill, I'm just barely running. 5 feet from zone, hit by more mobs, down to a sliver of health, zone.... into the middle of Lfay.<br />
<br />
Then later, I was fully buffed with symbols, bravery, and holy armor. A cleric, mage, and I were the only ones in zone. There was only one way to break a spawn (because of the darn pathing grr) So I pull a pledge, along with a garg, a caster, and an initiate joined in a repop. Big battle ensues. Bring down the caster real quick. Couldn't get off one spell.... ow darn damage shields. Garg goes down... then the pledge is next... cleric is OOM, I'm down to a bubble and a half. I tell the others to zone, and then I follow, get hit down to a sliver of health, zone. Into LFay at the MM entrance, only this time with no buffs.<br />
<br />
One lesson I learned, zoning when near death or dead is a very interesting experience and good for laughs a lot of the time.<br />

(without dying) I was in Unrest, at lvl 18, walking around that little island in the corner. I got the idea in my head to go through that underwater tunnel to where the gnomish spelunker spawns. I go underwater, and of course it is dark. Not only that, but as soon as I am in the tunnel (with no way to surface) I am attacked by two swimming Tormented Deads. Freaked, I go further into the tunnel. I have about a bubble of air left when I realize I am going the wrong way, I frantically swim back, wondering if I am even going the right way, or when I will be able to breathe. All the while I am being attacked. I finally found the surface with only a sliver of air, and a bubble of health left, and I had been holding my breath (in RL, I was so nervous) that I nearly passed out before I surfaced in the game.  Very scary</div></div><hr />

I was playing my girlfriends Barb Warrior the other night... she's level 12. I'm fighting in Blackburrow... and the only things I really fear are commanders and high elites. <br />
Random lowbie shouts &quot;TRAIN to zone!&quot;<br />
I'm near the bridge so I decide to stick around before beating a retreat. I see the aforementioned &quot;person of lower levels&quot; running from a group of like... a gnoll guardsmen and a coupla regular gnolls.<br />
&quot;Dang newbies,&quot; I scoff to myself, &quot;Thats not a REAL train.&quot;<br />
Wade into battle with my Shiny Brass Halberd swinging... then notice that the REAL train is the 2 elites, commander, and 3 guardsmen following a bit behind. I yelp somewhat loudly and quite unlike a warrior.<br />
I bellow my usual &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE... MOVE IT OR LOSE IT!!!&quot; a few times to warn everyone and then start my ascent to zone. I get out the top door... and get stunned BAD... 40hp to go... make it close to zone... 10hp... get stunned. *SMACK*<br />
Fall unconscious.<br />
Regain consciousness... and make it to zone... with ONE hitpoint. Meanwhile I'm praying to the Tribunal that I don't get smacked hard while zoning.<br />
Make it to the other side... fall unconscious... again.<br />

I was in Guk and no group. got bored went up to Upper with a friend my mine(me a 42 rogue him a 40 monk).  We think. Gee, we pretty strong and we kick arse, lets go camp GhoulBane. BAD IDEA.  No healer, just a monk and a rogue.  We fight our way to Barracks and clear front spawns.  Then we make a run for Lord area, taking all the center spawns with us.  We get there, and 6 more agro on us, plus the Skin Lord.  We think, ok, we cool, we can handel this.  After a short time, we kill the 3 shammies, then turn to Lord, get him down to 1/10 of HP, then DoH, Lay Hands, crap, back to full. Monk apolgizes then FD's. I haul major arse to zone.  Get past warder room with only a few agros, get to realist area, get turned around, been jumping so i had a little lead, but lost it here get hit, go to about 1 bub.  Turn around haul some more arse.  Get to scyer, guess what? scyer up, and he agros on me, starts trying to nuke me(resisted everyone though), and i get a drowsy(so much for every spell) from some nearby shammy.  Get to water, start swimming, got stuff beating on me all the way, finally, get to the top area, near zone, then <br />
A Shin Lord slashes YOU for 63<br />
A Shin Lord Slashes YOU for 48<br />
A Shin Knight Bashes YOU for 15<br />
YOU are stunned.<br />
crap.  a few seconds of stunned, then im off again at a crawl, probably could have sneaked faster than what I was going. 2 dodges, and a parry in a row then i zone.  Get to Inny, i have about 95 hp left.  <br />
<br />
When i zone I nearly went through the roof, biggest adrenaline rush i have ever gotten while playing EQ. The monk by this time had mended and made it somewhere safe and a guildmate ranger of mine had zoned in and taken out Lord. I was applying arse to ground in Inny.<br />

I get far enough ahead that I no longer here them behind me, make it up the ramp to FV zone and run SMACK into a 3rd Giant on his way back from zone. WTF?!!! No where to go but straight between his legs, wham, run, wham, walk, wham, crawl, must, get , to, zone,,, wham, dead. LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<br />

Show up in FV, run 2 zones back to FM, zone in and I am STANDING ON MY DAMN CORPSE!!!! Arrrghhhhh!<br />
<br />
The Ranger who died with me, also ran back to FM with me and commented &quot;Boy, don't that suck?&quot;<br />

Hm...I've had many close calls, but I think my deaths are actually more interesting.  For example, did you know that you can be killed in the split second between seeing LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... after zoning and your character actually dissapearing from the zone?  Figured that out with a daring charge at level 3 through the orc spawns in Highpass...and the time I was level 21 and was killed by (get this) a goblin scout.  Fighting in Everfrost out in the tundra, barely kill a shaman and I try to limp back to the Wall while poisoned.  I fall unconscious, and the poison wears off while I am about halfway down the bar (phew...) I limp again to the wall and have a seat, little knowing a scout is coming over the hill, and it charges me and gets in a hit for 8, knocking me unconsious again...what seems like half an hour later, it got a lucky hit for 3 that sent me to my bind spot *sigh*.  (true story, even though it sounds like a 1 in a million chance  <br />

<br />
Ok on my ranger me and my friend who was also a ranger were in the northern desert of ro and both had no food or drink so we decided to head to freeport. <br />
<br />
We were completely out of stamina and a mummy attacked us! We ran like hell to the platform and people started killing it. However, it hits me and I topple to the floor unconcious, the mummy dies leaving my friend almost at death when a jackal bites him in the back and he also falls unconcious but luckilly the people at the plat kill it. Well, here we both are lying diseased and with no stamina. Hah it was great we sat there for like 5 mins waiting for a heal  <br />
<br />
K the other one I was playing my enchanter with my friends necro and we were killing the bandits in Greater Faydark.<br />
Well one of them gets my enchanter low in health and stabs him in the gut, my friends pet destroys the bandit. Well I'm thinking &quot;No biggie, I'll just get up in a bit&quot; well I start sliding through the forest from when I was hit and when I wake up I'm at the PoD lift. That was by far the strangest near death experience  <br />

I am not a travelling rogue, but at my 12'th season I was getting a little sick of MT, I only found ur occasional blue spider or scarab ect. Needed group to hunt in orc camp, and gobbie  shams, which con BTM, spawn about once every 1,000,000,000,000 days. So I decided to go to a place I had been only a few times, most to meet a friend, almost never to hunt.                                                       heck I'll try to go there, get a group, or if noones there, I'll kill minor gobbies. Well, I was in luck, cause my levle 12 druid friend ( who I should mention has a very bad computer)( Takes him 5 *^%$in mins to zone!)is in the zone. we group, and share hunting with a half elf Druid 1 season our supieor. My friend went out to pull, while at the same time the Other Druid ( who I had made friends with sorta) went out to pull to. My friend comes back to ( I am in gorge for those who don't know) us with a muddite minor on his tail. not a problem normally. except that he had 3 mud elders on his tail, and we fought galiantly, thinking our friend would save us. Well, our friend came back, but with 3 other gobbies that conned Yellow to us, and soon more joined. I had a bub of hp, and was blinded. I circled around, hoping that might be enough to dodge some attacks. I regained my visionform a sec, but was blinded again and rushed the direction I had seen for a sec. it was the zone. I dived, and my computer seemed to freeze. I thanked Bristlebane, and sat, in about a minute I regaINED my vision and saw that I ahd about 12 hp, no granted, I was healing for a minute, so I figure when I ozned I ahd 2hp at max. When I was partially regained my strength, I zoned back into the gorge, only to find my friends ( 13 druid) corpse, with a dozen gobbie corpses around him, along with a lot of muddites. My friend was nowhere to be found. I could only gues he had paniked and ran into the depths of The gorge. killed somewhere along the way. I thanked the gods and camped. The next day I found out that my friend had gone LD! and the monsters had been drawn to the 13 druid, i think that is pretty good myself.

<br />
I was fighting in Blackburrow, when a level 54 mage wandered in and started casting Lava Shield on everyone.  My lucky day  <br />
<br />
Well, with that I ran off to train multiple gnolls on myself.  It worked, and I watched in glee as each gnoll was burned for 25 points of damage when they hit me.  My hp was going down as well, but I wasn't worried; there was only a burly gnoll left.  Well, it hit me several times, got burned several times, and kept at it.  Suddenly, I fell to the ground, unconscious.  I was bleeding to death!!!  I was down to about one bubble in the purple, when that gnoll bashed me for one point of damage.  <br />

I can't remember if it was a multiple pull or what, but our fight got nasty, and we both ended up running for the zone with a pixel or so of health left. We had both been poisoned in the course of the fight, so the first thing that happened was both us being knocked unconscious right after zoning... then watching our health slowly tick away as the poison worked.<br />
<br />
Then, with less than a purple bubble left, his poison broke and he regained consciousness and I followed him back to the land of the living soon after. <br />

<br />
I was lvl36, grouped with a lvl35 rogue. We were killing clockworks, the foreman, and the pred in sol a. I tanked 100% of the time because of my ability to heal myself, and evade. I did all of the pulling, of course.<br />
<br />
Eventually I decided to check on the goblin bartender, since when we met I had been soloing the bar area (it's great for 1 person, but it doesn't support two people 35+)<br />
<br />
I ran in, and the bartender wasn't up. But the drunkard was. He was green, and his common drop is *very* nice, so I decided 'What the hell?' and pulled him from his spawn point, to the secret hallway behind the foreman.<br />
<br />
Anyone who knows sol a knows that there's about 15 goblins between the two places :)<br />
<br />
I ended up at 1 bubble when the pull was over. My partner said that he would tank it while I bandaged up, since the drunkard was green to both of us.<br />
<br />
His pet, his 150+ dmg nukes, and his 15pt dmg shield made us realize the errors of our ways. I called for us to zone, but it took too long for us to get going.<br />
<br />
We burst through the secret wall, 5 seconds from the zone.<br />
<br />
A young goblin backstabs YOU for 110 points of dmg<br />
A fire goblin hits YOU for 63 points of dmg.<br />
You are unconcious!<br />
<br />
At this point, I stared down at my body in shock, unable to believe that I was about to die.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the drunkard+pet, and the 3 goblins in the room LEFT ME ALONE! In about 1 second, I regenned a single hp and feigned.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, when the goblins decided to leave me alone, they went for my partner and cut him down 2 seconds from the solb zone.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't know why they went after him instead of killing me, since when you get really low on hp, even lvl1 mobs will aggro on you.<br />
<br />
He got a lvl56 rez, though :)<br />
<br />
For anyone who knows the drunkard's common drop (which he had, since he wasn't wielding the staff), you will understand the irony of what happened. :( Pren, lvl40 Human Monk on The Tribunal server<br />

<br />
30th level hunting in CT still trying to get my damned RS arms. Running around in the CY helping out the lowbie groups while I'm waiting for some friends. Someone shouts train so I get myself set up to derail it. Low and behold theres the AOF and all his cronies. I'm hidden at the time so I figure, what the hell, I can't take em all down, but this is my first chance to get a poke or two in on AOF. So I sneak up to the zone and wait a bit for a good opportunity and WHAM, backstab the sob, he turns, stupidly I stand there to see what kind of melee he can do. Takes me down to half right quick so I dash out the zone. Loading please wait.,... Get to feerrott and start laughing my ass off. At the same time someone was training AOF inside, someone else was training Bouncer Hurd outside!!! HAHAHAH I look around and theres this HUGE pile of bodies of all these poor fools who had run from AOF only to get smashed by Hurd. I get hit a few times and manage to zone again. Get back into CT, got about a bub of health now, AOF still there, he hates me (go figure) and lays into me again. Get hit a couple and zone again. Back in feerrott, 25 hp left, zone before hurd hits me, (he's still there). End up zoning 7 times to evade the bastards. Finally its over, I got 12 hp left, counted 37 bodies between the 2 sides of the zone line that night.<br />

<br />
My girlfriend (cleric) got pummeled by a frenzied griffon in eastern wastes.  I had a CH'ing missionary on my hands along with a dire wolf.<br />
<br />
She fell to the ground just as I killed the griffon with Dimentia.  She had cast Superior heal on herself, got interrupted, fell to the ground and was bleading to death.  She was at 2 purple bubbles when she regained concentration and healed herself while laying on the ground!  I've never seen this happen in 2 years of play.  This happened 2 months ago or so.<br />
<br />
A second time a level 2 enchantress was fighting outside Felwithe.  I had an eye on her as I have a soft spot for newbie enchanters (until I find them wearing a siren scale anyways).<br />
<br />
She, of course, met an angry Orc Pawn that was quickly slain by the guards as she trained them.  The Orc though did get his wacks in and dropped her unconscious to the ground.  Playing an enchanter at the time, I could only try to save her life by using bandaids.  I applied one bandage to her as she lay on the ground and next thing, POP!  She stands up and is completly healed =)<br />

I jumped into the water by the bed room and took sneak off to get up the ledge. Well sadly their were a few undead froglocks who didnt like my sense of fashion I geuss who and decided to attack. Well they had to jump in the water and swim across to get me so I had a bit of a lead and decided to run. Well wouldnt you know it but the words &quot;OMFG TRAIN!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!!!!&quot; flash across my screen. Well I thought I'd be fine but the train came from the other direction and I ran right through it. Turning around the corner to get to the zone I was attacked by a sonic bat, which slowed me down enough for the Undead froglocks to catch up to me. Well I made one final dash for the zone as I watcheed my health steadily drop down...until I jump for the zone...and I get rooted. I try and jump suspecting it would be futile but as luck would have it the froglock knocked me across the zone line! I zoned through and was rooted right at the line with a meager 14hp left to spare.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Karak</div><div class="date">07-09-01, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can think of two decent times I've been CH'd while unconscious recently.<br />
<br />
The first time I was level 56, pulling in the crypt area in sebilis.  Well, the cleric's aegolism wore off just as I ate two tasty harm touches from a couple krup ghoul knights.  Needless to say, I arrived at the party's feet at well under a bubble of health, and the cleric had the audacity to begin casting 'complete heal.'<br />
<br />
Thinking quickly, i hit /disc nimble, but I'd spent that discipline in an encounter involving a few skeletal guards in front of the emperor, so I knew I was dead.  My pull comes to the party, and the enchanter gets a good ae stun off, buying the CH another second or three; but one krup woke up while she was busy mezzing the other one, and he promptly knocked me unconscious with one hit.<br />
<br />
Four hits later, as the frog swings, I had managed to riposte, dodge, and get missed twice, and the cleric's CH went off.<br />
<br />
The second time was in an AE group.  There is one thing about AE groups that you must know if you've never been in one.  The puller must have a deathwish; I have found no upper limit on the number of targets that can be AE stun/PBae'd to death at once, excepting the usual resists.  And I really did try.  On one pull, I managed to get absolutely every frog in a straight line path between the disco room and the bar room, with one quick detour into the exit to collect some golems, simultaneously. <br />
<br />
Naturally, when I get back to the group with half of sebilis on my heels, the Cleric (the SAME cleric as the previous crypt group) decides now's a good time to Make the Rogue Sweat (tm).  You guessed it; twenty or so frogs, four golems, and a pox scarab having me for lunch simultaneously, and I get the complete heal.  I did go unconscious first.  Amazingly, I survived, and so did the enchanter 11 seconds later when it was his turn for the HP bar to go purple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess I'd better pitch in...<br />
<br />
I've gone unconscious while fighting mobs dozens of times (including high-level meanies) - but my personal favorite stores are the ones I hear from my friends.<br />
<br />
A group of my friends were killing fire giants in solb a while back, with an SK puller named Kael (Yeah, same as the giant city - this was pre-kunark, forget velious).  A single FG gets pulled, and the main tank, an ogre named Kahzoo, is getting rather heavily owned.  The last hit knocks him down to unconscious with 2 bubbles of purple when kael stands up and HT's the FG, taunting it off of an UNCONSCIOUS warrior.<br />
<br />
This one's also worth relating.  A trio of friends of mine were hunting in the Hole - Rube (59 Wood Elf Rogue), Steele (58 Dwarven Warrior) and Djanee (57 Dwarven Cleric).  Rube was tanking a golem and got knocked unconscious, but Steele somehow managed to taunt the golem at the absolute last possible second off of him so Djanee could CH him.  After the fight, Steele says, 'Whoa, that was way too close...we thought you were dead!'  Rube replies, 'I was!  I saw Jebus!'<br />
<br />
*Substitute Je.sus for Jebus, naturally*<br />
<br />
Also, an enchanter on a hate raid got some bad resists and got mobbed and smacked down - but the cleric heal hit JUST as the killing blow landed.  Upon being revived, the enchanter confessed that she had actually gotten the 'You have been slain!' message and had been hearing the death music when the heal went off. /grin<br />

I was wandering aroudn trying to pull a corpse for Raid, and I happened by a wandering iksar ghost. Well he decided to play withj me that day. I was level 30 at the time. He Scourged and Feared me. I ran through the woods slowly dying, but outrunning him due to SoW. I eventualy stop being afraid, but as I had wandered I got lost. I ended up falling unconcious under a tree....The scourge wore off at -4 hps or so. I had to have our only ranger (lvl 40) come out into the jungle to find me, I banadaged myself up to half but sow wore off and couldn't leave ym spot hehe, spent 20 minutes in middle fo the nastiest zone I'd ever been in near death :P.

I was playing my cleric in Paw,  the new one.  We were doing ok until someone trained us with a pack of angry gnolls.  My group all made a break for the zone.  I was slightly behind everyone as they zoned.  So the gnolls decided to take it out on the cleric.  I was taking a lot of damage and there was no way I was gong to make it the last little bit.  I tried to cast Divine Aura then try to run.  Just before the spell finished I was knocked unconcious, but I got the message that I regained my casting and the spell went off.  So I am uncounsions but divined.  The pack of gnolls are trying tere best to finish the job.  I managed to regain concoiusness and limp to the zone before it wore off.....<br />

But the story goes beyond such commonplace trains.<br />
<br />
I had taken my acccustomed station a few feet out from the foot of the ramp.  After a couple of Harmonies, the druid cast whatever spell he was accustomed to casting to get the attention of a single orc, and hit the &quot;Inc&quot; hotbutton.<br />
<br />
I automatically turned my back to the oncoming druid...he had always pulled the orc just past me, paused long enough for me to Backstab/Attack and get the aggro, then move into the rear echelon with the magician.<br />
<br />
Well this time, he didn't stop...in fact he's running like hell.  The magician got up and busted off some kind of nuke and took off after the druid.  I'm wondering why the magician was nuking before I had the aggro well-set, but didn't spare it too much thought as I tried to get the orc off the fleeing druid.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, I noticed my life bar going away...FAST!  About this time, the druid manages to squeeze the word &quot;overpull&quot; out of his keyboard, and its a run for life to the Permafrost zone.  I had recently discovered the art of strafe-running, so I was taking not too much damage and was fairly confident of reaching the zone.  But the druid's life bar was nearly gone and the magician's wasn't too far behind.  I briefly considered whapping the orcs off my buddies, but hey, its an RPG and I'm a rogue, so screw 'em.  After all I'm not the one who overpulled.<br />
<br />
The druid goes down, I run past his body.  The magician's HP bar is empty, but I never saw his body, so I figured he had zoned (I had only been playing EQ for about 3 weeks, so a lot of the nuances of the interface were still a bit hazy).  I made the right turn into the IG castle and made a beeline for the back.  Just as I get to the back IG, someone pulled him across the room.  To late to swerve, I ran right through his proximity aggro.<br />
<br />
The IG slashes me for 140 or so, and I'm hurtin' BAD!  I make the last turn and see the magician sitting on the floor on the wrong side of the PF zone.  The IG slashes me again and suddenly I'm wading through molasses, struggling to get to the zone.<br />
<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
Thank Bristlebane there was no &quot;You have been slain by...&quot; message right above that.  A quick mash of the hide/seek hotbutton to avoid the aggro of the gobbie welcoming party and a few Bind Wounds later and I go back only to see the magician's body lying in the corner where he had been resting.<br />
<br />
A Magician_01 tells the group, &quot;heheh&quot;<br />
<br />
You tell your party, &quot;sorry about the ig, I couldn't get past him&quot;<br />
<br />
A Magician_01 says, &quot;so thats what it was...I never saw him coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
The best I can piece together is that the magician had actually died right after the druid, but was bound right where I had found him.  No sooner had he popped than the IG, frustrated at my escape, pounced on him and mashed him into the dirt...again.<br />
<br />
The druid disbanded and hasn't been heard from since.  The magician and I grouped with another druid and took multiple revenge on Redwind &amp;amp; Co. ( and still do on occasion).

<br />
We're in SolB, camping GEBS (we didn't get any by the way) at some point in our early 50's...somehow managed to clear all the way to Djarn with a monk, enchanter, cleric, rogue, and warrior...no Evac, as usual  <br />
<br />
Our monk had fallen into the pit trap, his brother the enchanter was over there duel/gfluxing to get the monk out of the lava, and me, the warrior, and the cleric are in Djarn's room...when my timer goes  beep  ONE MINUTE TO Djarn (or PH)...Great.<br />
<br />
Lucky, it's the imp PH.  Whew.  So we start to fight...the other two are still playing &quot;toss da monk&quot; so it's me and the warrior...  &quot;OOM&quot; says the cleric after a while, as she's lost her clarity a while back...<br />
<br />
I see the warrior crumple into a heap and I'm thinking &quot;Oh great, rogue pate&quot;...when the cleric finds the oomph to throw a light heal on the warrior who had only gone unconcious as I had drawn aggro off him JUST as he'd almost died (was down to some 1 purple).  <br />
<br />
She meds furiously as I tank for as long as I can, she CH's the warrior, he taunts, I evade, it hates him more now...  And we win!! <br />
<br />
By this time the monk had finally gotten out of the lava, he and his bro come back in, and we all got a good chuckle out of it.  <br />
<br />
We still laugh about it to this day, when most of us have reached the ripe old age when we CAN make light of such things.   Delissandra Splitshadow - First and Best Assassin in &quot;Far Seekers&quot; - The Rathe<br />

I could see the fire and the guards.... I yelled and kept running......with little life left and the Composer dead.... I was saved...<br />

So then, instead of sitting there and waiting for my life to go to full, I just attacked the guard who just saved me because my newbie bind point was right over there and I wouldn't loose any exp anyway. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Greyson26</div><div class="date">11-23-02, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some of my friends and my guild, a baptism through fire of sorts is soloing Ambassador D'Vinn in Crushbone. I could go on and on about what an undercon he is but why bother? Most of my friends tried him in their low to medium 20's, got their faces handed to them and fled. My real life brother got slaughtered at 30 with his Ogre Warrior (although to his credit he came back a level later and conquered D'Vinn).<br />
<br />
My tale. At level 26 I decided I had the gear, the skill and the moxy to make it happen so I went to Crushbone, camped the tower and waited. 3 pops of Lord Crush and then finally... the Ambassador. Truth is... my courage fled with his spawn. I was hidden and sneaking in the window sill behind him, but still. There's a certain eerieness about being so close to a man who had casually slaughtered me (and everyone else) so many times growing up. It was almost instictive to hit my number-lock key (auto-run) while typing /ooc Dvinn to zone!!! Like Pavlov's dog... I had almost developed an instinctual fear.<br />
<br />
I conned him. Blue or dark-blue. I guess-estimated he was around 24th level. I rationalized it was just a game, threw EQ caution to the wind and opened with a Backstab. If it lands, it's an omen for good and I will surely win with the Ambassador down a 100hp's or so in the opening seconds. If it misses... well... I wont think about what it means if I miss.<br />
<br />
I missed the backstab. Instantly I popped my autoattack ( the &quot;x&quot; button for me) and we began walloping on each other. Two fast striking, hard hitting killing machines going at it. It was ferocious! After just 20-30 seconds it became obvious... I was losing. D'Vinn rarely misses and was consistantly striking for around 40. With Silver Chitin Hand Wraps, Blood Point and a Shaded Dagger I felt that Quickfingers was damage capable of keeping up with the Dark Elf but the truth was he was slowly winning.<br />
<br />
I got down to 41% health.. D'Vinn's at 50%. I didn't know what to do. I began to panick. I had intentionally set up this situation so I would have no advantages besides the element of surprise (the failed backstab). There were no healers around, I had intentionally made sure I had no buffs and my gear, while expensive and personally purchased through hours of campinng, was not Godly... just good. And I was going to lose.<br />
<br />
At 22 or 23% health I resigned myself to the fact that D'Vinn was the most accurate punching mob in the game. I had lost. I was beaten. My piercing weapons were in the mid to high 20's, and even with my comparable speed, he simply refused to miss. (My Dex and Agility were both around 140+ at this time with maxed Defense and Dodge for the level)<br />
<br />
I admitted defeat by typing ever so slowly... /ooc D'Vinn to zone. I was ashamed. I figured I might have enough hp's to zone out alive... but did I want to live now? This was humiliating. And then... he missed! And he missed some more. And he contiuned to miss. And I kept hitting. Suddenly... I'm back in the ball game! I took this as some good karmic sign of victory... /ooc cancel D'Vinn to zone... sorry everyone!<br />
<br />
At one bubble of health D'Vinn turns and begins to flee. Two backstabs later, I win the most challenging duel of my EQ life. I'm level 37 now and seen a lot more than just some lowbie zone outside of Gfay, but this still remains my most memorable experince.<br />
<br />
For the record book I was down to just under one half bubble of health. So not the closest I technically ever was to dying (some Gobby Dirtcaller in FM once kept nuking and chased me to OT zone, I zoned with 3 hp's) but easily the best memory I have! Thanks for listening and any feedback is great!<br />

I had like 300 hp left and it was fadin quickly, so I make my way over to the seb orb and drop unconscience right next to it, so I click the orb real quick and zone in.

<br />
   Way back, even before this post was started I was a low level rogue hunting on Kerra island with a 9th level shaman, we'd come for XP and loot (Greater lightstones are worth a fortune right?)<br />
<br />
   SOWed and moving quickly around the island I had pulled several Wisps to him.  But the wisps stopped spawning so I pulled a spider, we beat it even though my life fell low because of the poison.  The shaman asked me only to pull spiders if I found no wisps.  I searched a good 5 minutes and finally went for another spider but it stunned me and I ran the wrong way for a while before realizing my error.<br />
<br />
   By the time I got to the Shaman I had 4 spiders on me.  The shaman said &quot;you're crazy, I am not gonna heal you&quot;.<br />
<br />
   So I ran, but there was nowhere to zone to, so I just ran in circles around the island (thank goodness for the shaman's SOW).  At some point I looked back and counted 17 spiders.  Ten minutes of running later there were so many I couldnt count them by their bodies or their names.  The names was one big mass of blue.<br />
<br />
   Finally my SOW started blinking and I figured my only chance was if a boat was on its way.  Sure enough I cut accorss the middle and saw the boat sail in.  I jumped aboard with 8 hit points left and shouted throughout the zone &quot;I LIVE!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
   Story 2:<br />
<br />
   A cleric friend of mine and a Troll shaman we just met named Dooktooth were in Lake rathe killin Aviaks at the 2-spawn.  With three of us to kill 2 aviaks there's alot of downtime between the pops so I decided to teach my compatriots &quot;cliff diving&quot;.  <br />
<br />
   (Just find a high place and jump into the water tapping the jump button on the way down to prevent hitting the side of the cliff)<br />
<br />
   My cleric buddy catches on quick enough, but Dooktooth tries once and nearly dies...so he gives up the practice.<br />
<br />
   Two hours and dozens of jumps later with neither the Cleric or me taking any damage ol Dook decides its maybe not so hard after all.<br />
<br />
   I show him which side to jump off of and position myself near the water in case he takes damage again.<br />
<br />
   Finally when ready he yells &quot;DOOKTOOTH!!!!!!!!&quot; across the whole zone and jumps.<br />
<br />
   I can't see him, I only hear wham...WWHAAMMM!!..splash.<br />
<br />
   I look up in the group window and see he only has 2 purple health bubbles, HOLY CRAP.  So I panic, I jump into the water to heal him, but still had some forward momentum and the spell was cancelled.  I wait until I was just sinking and cast heal again.  My spell is nearly finished when a green conned shark appears outta nowhere and kills Dooktooth with one bite.  My buddy and I laughed about it for an hour at least.</div></div><hr />

/sigh I can't even begin to numerate the number of times I've come soo freakin damn close to dying.  They've all kinda blurred into one memory, but some of my best times were spent running for zones/guards, making bets with the zone if I would make it and if I did, with how many hps.<br />

<br />
Anyhow, I've a rather funny one myself.  it involves the sphinx enchanter in rathe mountains, rharzhar the drake for the SK epic, 2 groups of my guildies, and my lv 33(at the time) sk.  Welp it was gettin late, but a guildie was pissed off to no end cuz shed been killed by some thing with a wierd name starting with &quot;Z&quot; in rathe mountains.  Zazamoukh? I ask her.  She says Yeah! that was him!  So our whole guild thats on(9 ppl counting me, a cleric, warrior, paladin, enchanter, me, and a few others I dont recall) decides to get her some payback(shes the enchanter).  Me, being an sk, says &quot;hey, if rharzhar's up could we try him?&quot;  they say nah, hes too powerful.  So we go over there, I'm early and decide to smack around the drakes.  Rharzhar pops, so I run off and hide near the wall.  He ignores me.  The guild shows up, and we kill the sphinx.  Was a tough fight, and we med to full, and are debating whether to smack around rharzhar or not.  Well, rharzar herself decides it for us.  She sneaks up BEHIND the enchanter, and aggros.  Dead enchanter from 500+ nukes.  Everyone tries to get some semblance of order made, I harmtouch, cleric starts healing, we
