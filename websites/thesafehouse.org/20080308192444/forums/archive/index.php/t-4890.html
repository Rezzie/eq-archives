<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Makktan</div><div class="date">02-15-02, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a lvl 21 SB that I'm playing and I need some clarification on this skill and how it relates to Critical Strike skill.  I have read alot of information regarding this skill and it is confusing as hell as the information seems to contradict each other.  This is what I have so far.....<br />
<br />
1.  Training the Left Axe skill gives me dual attack.  Training this skill to higher lvls enables me to acquire &quot;stlyes&quot; to use during combat.  Training this skill increases my attack damage when using these styles, however it does not increase the damage to Critical Strike damage because that skill goes off of the base Sword/Critical Strike skill for damage.  Is this correct?<br />
<br />
2.  As noted on DAOC Catacombs, Left Axe skill is very similar to the Hib, Alb 2H Weapons skill.  This skill is one of the &quot;advanced skills&quot; in DAOC and to increase the damage output of your &quot;main weapon&quot; you still need to train the weapon you are using in your right hand.  Is this also correct?   <br />
<br />
3.  Due to recent patches, I have heard that just training Left Axe will also increase the damage output to Critical Strike (as long as you are attacking with 2 weapons when you use CS.)  So the need to train your Sword skill is not required to increase damage for CS.  Is this correct?<br />
<br />
With all this stated....is Left Axe worth the skill points to make it a viable choice for a SB?  I really like the Envenom Skill in conjuction with the Left Axe, but is the Envenom Skill nerfed so bad that this is worth it?  There are so many skills to train for this guy....and I feel that there are not enough points.  Please help me with this dilemma.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks to me like left axe is a requirement of SB's</div></div><hr />

<br />
Left Axe skill decides:<br />
<br />
Damage range of your left axe weapon<br />
Total Damage done with 2 weapons, using the following formula- Total Damage = (normal damage/2)+25%+(left axe/2)%<br />
<br />
Left axe is one skill shadowblades can ignore, because we can use 2h weaponry.  Currently I use sword and shield and am not having any issues with it at level 39.<br />
<br />
As far as letting main weapon atrophy and focusing on left axe, I haven't ever read about it raising critical strike damage, and all other weapon styles go off main hand as well, so it would have to do the same for those as well, for it to be a viable option. Dither Disgustipated<br />

After 46 seasons, if I had the chance I would remove my LA points all but maybe....4 and put them  into CS&amp;amp;Sword.</div></div><hr />

I am glad you said that.<br />
<br />
I just got to level 50 today, and I went sword/crit/stealth and a bit of poison.  Everyday I wonder if I would have been better off going Left Axe.<br />
<br />
That level 39 Left Axe style would be awesome since we get so much Evade.<br />
<br />
But I guess most assassins don't take Left Axe that high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ubergnome563</div><div class="date">02-17-02, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the 2 handers seem to outdamage plain old LA anyway, got hit by a SB with a 2 hander for 475 (critical hit for sure, but not a critical strike or style), and since you need weapon spec anyway, you could just save the points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Skyro</div><div class="date">02-17-02, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">to my understanding (asking other cs sb's), the lvl 34 left axe anytime style does similar damage (in actuality more damage because 1h'ers are faster) does as roughly about the same damage as the pa-chains (creeping death/stunning stab). At least in terms of the style bonus. I'm at level 42 right now, and it is not uncommon for me to use my style bonus on my anytime style doing 100+ on even cons. That's like me doing 200 damage a round at 1h'er speed. Take that however you will.<br />
<br />
On a side note I had originally planed on taking my cs to just 21 for pa, hoping I could get away putting so little into cs. But after noticing my 34 left axe anytime style was outdamaging my pa at times hehe I decided I had to further pump it up to make it viable (or else those cs points would have been wasted). So I plan on taking it to 34 for creeping death (for the stun) so I'll know first hand the damage. Just gotta get to lvl 45...</div></div><hr />
