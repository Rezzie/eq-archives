<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borrak</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This question may be premature being that the new poisons are still in the infant stages, but can these poisons if traded and sold be used by low level rogues such as myself?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking they can since the apply poison skill doesn't seem to apply (pun intended) anymore.<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried this? Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squink McPoke</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the minimum level on the new poisons is 46.  I don't know what level you are, that information isn't included anywhere in your post, but I could see there being a market out there for people that can/will use them, just to save the hassle of having to do all the running around and combining. -- Squink McPoke, 61 Assassin, Lanys T'vyl.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Chaid Duskwalker</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's certainly a market for the 8 new poisons you need for the GMAS quest.  I've sold off my excess vials already.  I would have been happy to buy them too, instead of going to the armpit of Norrath (SoNH) to get 4 components in an hour of non stop green-con farming.<br />
<br />
/rude poison component farming, for the sole sake of making poisons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd certainly pay for em.<br />
<br />
If they end up being worth using at all on raids, I'll gladly pay to not have to screw around making advanced vials and celestial eessences.<br />
<br />
Course, I'd expect the raid fund to reimburse my expeses as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lifty</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">chick had 243 celestial essences for sale in the bazaar tonight for 10pp each.  i bought a buttload of em.  i see a market for any of this stuff.  sometimes time &gt; money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squink McPoke</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10pp each?  She made a *killing* on that.  Cost is under 2pp to make, and it's just a few clicks.  Heck, I do that while running from place to place to pass the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_RanjaInno</div><div class="date">10-30-02, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What would you guys consider a fair (for both sides) bazaar price for empty Advanced poison vials then? <br />
<br />
Hard Way: Pottery, ~2pp plus skin/pelt plus lotsa work<br />
Easy Way: Tinkering, ~17pp not including failures<br />
Ultraeasy : Buying in Bazaar ... xx pp ?<br />
<br />
While a bazaar price around 20pp might be realistic, it could be a bit pricey for a 15 minute buff when you still need resin, suspension and component(s). So, what would be reasonable?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_twinbabas</div><div class="date">10-30-02, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I plan on selling my advanced vials for 20pp-25pp each.  I haven't had a chance to price out the other components, but will soon offer the suspension and problably purified water.<br />
<br />
If people don't buy, it's ok, I&quot;ll just use them for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underdawg Darogue</div><div class="date">10-30-02, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The poison market will only really take off after more rogues get their make poison AAs maxed. Without those AAs the failure rates make the poisons cost more then they need to. A 10 charge bite of the shissar I would not think of selling for less then 300pp. And I would consider that price a steal considering I probably failed 4 to 5 poisons to make it. For me it is also that price because as a gnome I see no real reason to not just tinker my own vials with a peridot and avoid the time sink of making them conventionaly. Is there a minimum level of 46? I dont think so. It is a recommended level but I have seen nothing yet to indicate a level 45 rogue couldnt use em. Heck the level recommendation on that same poison in its 10 charge form goes from 46 to 53. But I doubt you really ahve to be 53.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">10-30-02, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think perhaps that you might not find a market for completed poisons right away.  But I'm pretty sure that essences and advanced vials will be profitable almost immidiatly.</div></div><hr />
