Some people like to min max iam one of those people. but truthfully play the Race you want to. Its gonna all balance out in the end.</div></div><hr />

There isn't ever going to be a game where the race restrictions are strict enough to make a huge difference on the game. I know on the FFA server there are only 3 gnome rogue that are 30+ so it kinda makes you rare hehe.</div></div><hr />

I play a gnome rogue on the Targonor server.  What make the gnome stick out to me is the racial ability.  The mez and the rez stone can really save the day for you.  Seems to be the most usefull racial i've seen.</div></div><hr />

I'm not 100% sure but it seems to boost the bonus damage of exploiting weakness.  Which for you rogues who havnt noticed, even at low intell seems to add 1k extra damage at higher levels. Iv seen my damage boost over 2k per exploit with some intell buffs on.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to see someone with a parser (and parsing skills and experience) cheking this out...<br />
So far, all my points are going to str/dex and leftovers to con/vit...<br />
But if this is true, I'm all about taking some of my dex and putting it on int.</div></div><hr />
