<br />
I've currently got physician (cheap healing with bandages)<br />
<br />
herbalism, with the intention of getting alchemy<br />
<br />

I still things those are great combos for rogues. Leatherworking and enchanting are also great particularly if you couple them with skinning and herbalism respectively.<br />
<br />
Cooking and fishing is also a nice combo.<br />

<br />
alchemy seems cool, can make sellable healing potions<br />
<br />
are there any other higher end potions worth making?<br />
<br />

Leatherworking allows you to create sellable items from skins as well as &quot;armor kits&quot; that add armor to some types of equipment (permanent change).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lomack</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just about every tradeskill is handy to have.  However points wise it would be impossible to &quot;Master&quot; all of the Tradeskills at once, as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
Gathering Tradeskills:<br />
Herbalism - lets you find herbs and collect them, for use in Alchemy and Enchanting.<br />
Mineing - Lets you mind and smelt Ore that you find.<br />
Skinning - Lets you skin animals that are dead to get leather parts.<br />
<br />
First Aid - Lets you make bandages and other salvs from cloth and other components that you find.  It can heal, cure poisons, and such as your skill goes up.  Very handy for the Warrior, Rogue, Warlock and Mage classes that can't do this stuff on their own.<br />
<br />
Enchanting - Lets you add buffs to items, that are permainent, and some temporary ones.  You can enchant other people's items, unless they are Soulbound, meaning not able to be traded.  But you can enchant your own Soulbound items.<br />
<br />
Alchemy - Lets you make potions, healing, water breathing, potions that give your weapons procs, potions to give to others.  There are rage potions for giving your warriors, there are invis potions to give to your friends without stealth, there are potions people can drink to increase fire damage, mana potions, etc...<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing - Can make weapons and mail armor.<br />
<br />
Tailoring - Mainly used for making Cloth armor but also used to make Bags, which are quite valuable once they get to the larger sizes.<br />
<br />
Leatherworking - Used to mainly make Leather Armors, and leather kits which can bolster the armor level of many items.<br />
<br />
Engineering - Can make many handy items.  Dynamight, guns, practice locks, a variety of trinkets, exploading sheap :)<br />
<br />
Cooking - Lets you make food.<br />
<br />
Basically every tradeskill has uses for every class.  The most usefull ones for a rogue are probably the Leatherworking, to make the armors, which would necessitate someone to have skinning.  First Aid is nice, but its not really something you can use while mobs are hitting you, but you can bandage yourself and others.  Alchemy is also handy, but also necessitates you to have Herbalism. Cooking would also be handy for a rogue, but like First Aid its not really something that will help you in combat, but something that will help you between combats.  Sadly Cooking is not very marketable as far as selling to other folks, but its really handy to have food, not something you want to run around without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Herbalism/Alchemy has been extremely useful for keeping me well-stocked with panic-button healing potions, even at very very low Alchemy skill levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emrys</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 18 I've got Herbalism, Enchantment, and cooking. I might be tempted to trade out enchantment for Alchemy for those insta-heal potions, but I'm liking enchantment too.<br />
<br />
I buff myself up on enchantments and I take less dmg thanks to defense skill increases and dmg absorption.<br />
<br />
My skill is only around 50, so I can't enchant a ton. I dunno if I'll be able to take more than one craft above apprentice any time soon though.<br />
<br />
Cooking is nice, since I never run out of food.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I'd make great use of healing potions in alchemy since I usually just Sprint off if I get in trouble, but I might.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikus</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont play in the beta but I guess if engineering works the way it is planned then I would definately go the Herbalism/Poison and Mining/Engineering way... <br />
<br />
Engineering Link (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/tradeskills/engineering.shtml)<br />
<br />
They got AE Dynamit / Booby Traps / Exploding sheeps...<br />
<br />
This definately fell in my way of playing a rogue...<br />
<br />
1. Move behind Mob stealthed<br />
2. Distract other mobs throwing a stone or knock it out with a &quot;Sap&quot;tm<br />
3. Aggro the Mob with huge Special attack, maybe even land a poisoned strike<br />
4. Pull the mob the path along you trapped with engineered landmines<br />
5. Cut the remaining life out of the Mob  :evil</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kivi</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is it that a lot of you have EZ as a prefix?</div></div><hr />

This is from the old ezBoard forums. Any post made by someone with the EZ_ prefix means it was made on the ezBoard forums and has been migrated over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Engineering sounds like it'll be a blast, I love how things can explode like the rocket boots and jumper cables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenardo</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">engineering for a rogue would be nice.<br />
<br />
ME i am currently a shaman was a rogue last push<br />
<br />
my rogue was herbalism/alchemy - and believe me those healing potions come in handy..and the armor and the agility and the etc etc. <br />
<br />
i'll probably end up being <br />
<br />
mining/engineering going to expert <br />
herbalism/alchemy journeyman<br />
<br />
WHY?<br />
<br />
herbalism for the healing potions<br />
mining engineering for the practice locks (for lockpicking) and for the pet and the bombs....target dummy is handy too..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bengel Tyger</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is it that a lot of you have EZ as a prefix?<br />
<br />
Because those are posts that got ported over from the EZBoard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emrys</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I ended up unlearning enchantment and learned alchemy. I'm glad I did! Already with a skill of 80 I can make HP potions which are helpful in fights. I can make +20 Defense, +~25 HP, +4 str, all of 60 min duration. <br />
<br />
I can also make water breathing potions, mana potions, etc. The water breathing potions require a certain fish as a reagent, and the next level healing potion requires an herb, Mageroyal, that I've been unable to find a good source for. The mana also requires an herb that I don't know how to find.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm using these potions every time I play, and they are far more &quot;self-useful&quot; than enchantment ever was. Enchantment might be a better way to make money, but alchemy is much more useful on an everyday basis.<br />
<br />
My problem right now is that journeyman herbalism costs 75 SP to learn (!), so I've got to save up a lot.</div></div><hr />
