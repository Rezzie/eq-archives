<br />
We are so heavily modifying the engine and will continue to do so, that it really doesn't look anything TODAY like what it originally did. One of things we did want to do before we talked about what tech we were licensing, etc., is get some screenshots out, maybe a movie, more previews and demos, etc.<br />
<br />
In any case, you'll here more about the relationship soon... very soon <br />
<br />
T. King adds a bit more: (http://www.vanguardsoh.com/forums/showpost.php?postid=76360&amp;postcount=60)<br />
<br />
After consolidating my thoughts I have this to say; our programmers, designers and artists have applied their skills to the engine meticulously and with great assiduity, much in the way that an artist applies paint to a canvas, and have built a vast fantastical world of amazing possibilities, upon the strong foundation of a proven graphical engineering masterpiece, that has itself been taken to an entirely new level of sophistication.<br />
<br />

...I definitely wouldn't say it's good, I'd say it's incredibly awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once you say something like the Unreal Engine, all sorts of images (good and bad) pop into your mind about the great FPS games that have been built on this technology. Then there are thoughts on how Unreal games are more often first person than third, and whether Vanguard will be too...<br />
<br />
Speculation is fun, and by no means do I want to discourage it <br />
<br />
But, please do keep in mind that we are using all of this tech to get us going... as crucial stepping stones to get us making the game, not the technology, tools, or engine. This is important... key, in fact: we are at the same time heavily modifying the code base to turn everything MMOG specific (and, more so, Vanguard specific).<br />
<br />
Just for example, we added per pixel lighting, bump and specular, seamless world technology, completely re-did terrain (including building special in-house terrain creation tools), re-worked (and continue to do so) the networking layers, and more (Ryan Elam could go on and on).<br />
<br />
I'd also point out, just for example, that Lineage 2 uses the Unreal engine as a basis, and I know they too have heavily modified it. It's a seamless or almost seamless world, and it's third person with 'Asian' style point and click movement.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just some food for thought.</div></div><hr />
