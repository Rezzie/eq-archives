<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">storgue</div><div class="date">09-27-02, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It used to be one of dcent things about applying poisons was you could have them inside a container and still apply.  After the new UI came out, it seems you can only start applying from an open slot.  I have found you can start applying on an open slot then move the poison into a bag while you finish, but I liked the old way alot better.  Anybody else notice this change ?<br />

It's been around for a while actually. With the old UI I got around it by switching to window mode, start the application and then switch back to full screen. Unfortunately there is no windowed mode with the new UI.<br />
<br />
The other day I got a tell from Tiraj. He was trying to apply something and couldn't. I asked if he was sitting and/or trying to apply from a container. He evidently didn't understand my question about the container but later I got a tell that he had figured it out by removing from the bag. Runehammer Trollsbane<br />

You need to be holding the weapon when you click on the poison.<br />

Clicking the poison is what counts, regardless of what item is on your cursor. It will then go off on the next strike done with a piercing weapon (includes piercing weapons which can also be thrown (non-stacking daggers), but not pure throwing weapons (shuriken etc)).</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. You can take your poison out of your bag, place it in an open inventory and right click to apply. You can then put the poison into an open slot in a bag, close the bag, open another bag, make some new poison, etc ... as long as you don't stand, the poison will apply.<br />
<br />
3. While you are applying the poison, if you stand up, the apply is cancelled and you still have your poison.<br />
<br />
Tips:<br />
<br />
1. If you have a free inventory slot, you can place a vial of poison there and then hotkey that slot. Then, hit a key to apply the poison (very handy when you have an &quot;add&quot;)<br />
<br />
2. If you don't have an open inventory slot, you can still hotkey the container. Then you hit one key to open to bag, grab the poison, swap it with the bag in the hotkey location ... etc....<br />
