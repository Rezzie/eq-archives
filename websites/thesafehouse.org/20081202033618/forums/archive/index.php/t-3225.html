<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargesh</div><div class="date">07-02-02, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After delaying the release of Neverwinter across the country from last Friday until today, NWN has finally been released.  My local EB had a midnight launch for it and I figured what the hell, I would go along.  <br />
<br />
I had never been to a midnight release for anything before, although I had been tempted by the last Star Wars Movie.  I now know why.  The underbelly of gaming came out to be amongst the first to own NWN.  There was everything from hardcore gaming geeks to guys who just wanted to say that they owned the game first.  There was even a woman there, although I suspect she was someones long suffering partner from the look of exasperation and bewilderment on her face.<br />
<br />
My favourites amongst the crowd (suprisingly there were about 60 people) were the guys who try and cover up the fact that they know very little about much of anything by talking louder then everyone else about how they fragged this, summoned that or generally just rock.  <br />
<br />
There was also one guy who was returning a copy of DAoC (which has only just been released here also) because &quot;a friend told him that he had the wrong version&quot;.  The guy behind the counter tried explaining that there was only one version, but as the guy only wanted store credit, he wasn't too stressed. <br />
<br />
All in all, it was definately a different experience.  Not something I will probably repeat any time soon.  But at least now I can say that I have done it, cross another thing off of the to do list and get down to some serious gaming.</div></div><hr />
