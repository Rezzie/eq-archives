<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renn</div><div class="date">02-04-07, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Society of Depravity is the new name for an old guild. We have played several games together over the years, but are making Vanguard SOH our new home. <br />
<br />
We are not led by a single person, but rather a comittee of leaders. We are always seeking more people to assume responsabilities and / or offer suggestions toward making the guild a better place. <br />
<br />
We are seeking mature Adventurers, Crafters, and Diplomats to join our forces. <br />
<br />
We are all new to the world of Telon and looking for new friends we can explore, and quest together with. We plan to offer a regular raid schedule to our adventurers as content is discovered with looting based on a dkp system. We are always willing to help one another. <br />
<br />
Many of us plan to craft, and have in other games. Our goal is to support our crafters as much as possible. To supply them with the resources required to reach the greatest levels possible. We would like to outfit and house the guild, while still maximizing the profitability of crafting for the guild in general as well as the individual crafters. <br />
<br />
We are certain diplomacy will become an integral part of the game as it progresses and expands. We would like to offer a place for diplomats to coordinate together towards mutual goals. And like our adventures and crafters will support our diplomats as much as possible. <br />
<br />
We use ventrillo as our default voice chat software which will in the future be required for raiding. Curentley it is helpfull tool for grouping and questing, not to mention a great way to hang out togther. <br />
<br />
If this sounds like the type of orgnaization you would like to call your home please vist our forums at www.societyofdepravity.com to apply.</div></div><hr />
