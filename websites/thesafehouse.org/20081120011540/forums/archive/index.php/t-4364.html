<br />
The manual talks about having two classes of a certain level and completing a quest. What quest? What level?<br />

You need a damselfly worm, magicked skull and a crab apron from stuff in Valkurm. You need to be level 18 in one job to get the quest. The quest guy in Seblina is down by the water on the far right.<br />
<br />
Damselfly worm is a rare drop off off mobs of the same name in Valkurm.<br />
<br />
Crab aprons are from Snippers, not too rare.<br />
<br />
Magicked Skull is from ghouls, that appear only at night in a few different zones.<br />
<br />
Hand them in as he request them and you will be enabled to set a subjob that can be maximum of 1/2 the level of your main job. You have to have achieved that level in the class you set the subjob as.<br />
<br />
Subjobs make things a lot easier.</div></div><hr />

One starts in Mhara, the other in Selbina. You must be 18th lvl. For the Selbina quest, you must recover &quot;Damsel worm&quot; from valkrum desert, &quot;Crab Apron&quot; from valkrum desert, and a &quot;magicked skull&quot; that drops off Ghouls in Valkrum desert and a few other places(Gungens mine has tons of them). Don't remember the specifics of the Mhara quest. All infos are here....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">11-17-03, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just clarifying, your secondary job can be ANY class except your main class. Brelkor sorta confused me by implying that only the advanced jobs can be sub-jobs. Maybe it's just me misreading it.<br />
<br />
Any job can be Main or sub. Advanced jobs are at 30, sub jobs are 18. Kerayu, Mithra 10 Thief / 10 Monk of Phoenix.</div></div><hr />

All can be found in Bubimuneru (sp?) peninsula.<br />
<br />
The bogys are rather nasty, and is harder to do then the skulls from ghouls.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">11-17-03, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can change it at any time, too. Your main job can be your sub job, and vice versa. It doesnt matter at all. If you have access to the class, it can be your sub or main job.<br />
<br />
It can be accessed and changed in your mog house.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ubernome</div><div class="date">11-18-03, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recap:<br />
<br />
A character may have 2 jobs, one main job, one sub job. You may choose any class but the same one for your main job and sub job.<br />
<br />
Both main job and sub job can be changed at your mog house.<br />
<br />
Sub job will always be half the level main job is. IE: if you are 20 warrior and 15 theif, using war for main, theif for sub, you'll be 20 war/10 theif; using theif for main, war for sub, you'll be 15 theif/7 war.<br />
<br />
Only the main job will get exp when you are fighting monsters.<br />
<br />
The quests that gives you the ability to pick a subjob will be unlocked at level 18, see previous posts for details<br />
<br />
Further more, &quot;advanced jobs&quot; can be unlocked at level 30 via quests in Cities, you get access to more I wouldn't say powerful, but unique classes such as Bard, Dark Knight, Paladin, Beast Tamer, Summoner, Dragoon, Ninja and Samurai.<br />
<br />
Do you must have a sub job? No, but you gain the stats and abilities from the sub job, it's almost like playing two characters at once, but not. For example, lvl10 theif gives you dex/agi bonus, evasion bonus, higher dagger skill cap. So when you sub the theif with war, your warrior will get those bonuses as well. Which makes life alot easier in high levels.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrocat Moonstalker</div><div class="date">11-19-03, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do advanced jobs also have to be only to half of your main jobs level? Can you have an Advanced Job (lvl30), Main job (the one you started with), and a sub job(lvl18)?<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you can change your subjob whenever you want... does it retain your old level? K, that's confusing so i'll give an example. Say you're a level 20 theif, and you have a subjob of a level 10 warrior. You can change your subjob to say.. a ranger right? And you start at level 1 as a ranger. You level him up to say 5, (your theif would then be capped at 2) and you decide you want your sub job to be warrior again.. can you change it back to warrior and be a 20 theif/10 warrior again? Or do you have to restart your warrior at level 1? Or can you not change what class your subjob is? I understand that you can switch between your subjob and main job (ie, your main job becomes a  10 warrior and your sub is a 5 theif then), but can you change the class of your sub? Gah, so confusing! Edited by: Pyrocat Moonstalker  at: 11/19/03 8:35 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">11-19-03, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Secondary jobs are capped at the 1/2 point.<br />
<br />
If you have 20 levels as a Warrior, 18 as a Thief, and 10 as a Monk, then you would have the following effective levels when subbed:<br />
<br />
20 War / 10 Thief<br />
20 War / 10 Monk<br />
10 Monk / 5 War<br />
18 Thief / 9 War<br />
10 Monk / 5 Thief<br />
<br />
etc.  Note that the subjob level is only effective.  If you did the 10 Monk / 5 War route, then changed your Primary back to Warrior, you would still be 20 War.<br />
<br />
It's moderately straightforward once you look at the system as a whole.  1 main job, which is the only job that gains XP or skill increases.  1 sub job, which is capped at an effective 1/2 your main job for purposes of determining stats and bonuses, and which does not gain XP or skill increases.  Both main job and sub job can be changed, whenever you want, in whatever combinations you want.  However, certain inherent game mechanics make Melee / Caster or Caster / Melee combinations relatively weak. Amadan  ::  Child of the Phoenix  ::<br />

Can anyone confirm this?  Planned on leveling Ranger while subbing Samurai later on to cut down on time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">11-20-03, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your Subjob is passive.  It gives stats, abilities, and skills, but does not gain XP.  In your case, you would gain XP as a ranger and have some samurai skills.  If you wanted to increase your samurai level, you would have to change it to be your Primary.</div></div><hr />
