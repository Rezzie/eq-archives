I have just talked to Remy and he has ported me to the room. I am level 15 and I think the 2 guards con yellow, when I attack they beat me to a pulp before i get one of them to 50%.<br />
<br />
I need some help/tips. Why did I get slaughtered so easily when I've been reading that others have done it with relative ease at that level. I have decent armor and weapons so I don't think that's an issue.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have anyone else port in with you to kill them together? Even as level 17 I just don't see myself being able to pull this off solo.</div></div><hr />

I did it a few days ago at level 14 (granted, I'm a Crusader, but still...).  Failed twice, then succeeded the third time.  I'm not sure about how Scouts manage their skills and whatnot, but the best tips I can give are:<br />
When you zone in, DON'T MOVE.  Wait for a minute, buff up as much as you can, allow your power to regen, then attack the guards.  Focus on one guard until he's dead, then work on the other one.  After the two guards are dead, rebuff and rest.  Once fully healed/powered, proceed up the stairs and take out the guard captain.<br />
<br />
Super-important: Heroic Opportunities.  Use them, and use them nonstop.  They are the only way you'll get the edge and best the opponents.  The reason I failed the previous two times was that I wasn't managing my heroic opportunities effectively to get the most available opportunities off.  Make sure to use them, and you should be fine.  I imagine it'll be a little harder for you than me, since my Crusader had more HP, but it should still be doable.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have spirit shards left in the room, my suggestion is to make a kamikaze run in, and absorb all of them, aggroing whoever you have to.  Just make sure you get all of them.  Then, run back to the zone-in door to die (since you can't zone out).  You will leave one shard there.  The next time you try, as soon as you zone in, you won't have to move and aggro the guards in order to retrieve your shard and get back up to full power.<br />
<br />
Hope some of this helps. :)</div></div><hr />

The first time I did the fight, I died without making a dent in either guard.  The second time, I defeated both initial guards and ended at full health.  Both times I had the same buffs on, and was the same level.  I just chalked it up to getting [bad] rolls in the first fight, and [good] rolls in the second fight.<br />

*edit* fixed a sentence to make sense.</div></div><hr />

Sneak attack when you can, shouldn't be much different for a rogue as opposed to a predator.</div></div><hr />

Poison and heroic opportunities are an absolute must.  Go in buffed with like Bestowal of Vitae and take advantage of it for the time it lasts.</div></div><hr />
