<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PsiKoTicK</div><div class="date">08-13-07, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(I will come back in and edit in changes, and updates, such as names - typing this up at work, so I don't recall all the exact details)<br />
<br />
First things first.  You need -1000 Faction with the Var Efreet to receive this quest.  To get faction, you can kill efreetis in and around Rahz, for 1 or 2 faction each.  Deeper you are in Rahz the more likely it's 2.  The easier way is to collect Searing Stones.  50 Stones = 1 Searing Stone Bag.  Turn in bags in Afrit for armor (some of it's decent).  Each bag = 50 faction (1 faction per stone, basically).  Almost every mob in Rahz drops either 2 stones, a bag, or a Powerful Card of Fate.  Right click the card for stones (between 5 and 15, usually), a bag (rarely), or a &quot;Slay:  Named&quot; stone.  You can right click the stone to get a quest, with a reward of 3 stones.<br />
<br />
There are 3 items for 3 bags each, 3 items for 6 bags each, and 3 items at 10 bags each.  Once you have gotten all of these items, you open up a cloak at 20 bags (I think), then a ring and earring at 60 bags each (I think).  After ALL of that, you get another item, which is actually an ability for your archetype.  Healers can mez, Medium fighters can exploit a vulnerability (required for the mez to actually work), Tanks get a 2 minute taunt until the mob is hit (by anyone).<br />
<br />
Now, at some point during all this collecting, you will notice Handler Aerco has a quest for you (when you get -1000 faction).  He is near the other 2 guys who give you the armor, and other items.  Grand Provisioner Something and Blahblahblah.<br />
<br />
An Unworthy Plea – Level 45<br />
This quest requires you to go to Nusibe Necropolis, and speak to Lord Neferset.  He is a floating skeletal head in a column of light.  However, you have to fight down to him.  There are loads of 3 dot mobs, and the Pharaoh will curse you as you go.  Collect Fragments and Shards of Arazmus if you can (anyone doing the quest will require 5 Fragments and 3 Shards later) on the way down.  At this point in the dungeon, everything leads to Lord Neferset (it’s basically a symmetrical dungeon – it stops being that way later).  Hail the floating head.<br />
  <br />
Raiding The Tombs – Level 46 &amp; Energizer Mummies – Level 46<br />
  This quest requires you to go to back to the entry hall, and fight over to the far right room (from the entryway).  Inside you will find Berakut, and he will give you a quest to kill 100 undead in the necropolis.  You can also get Mummies Gotta Eat Too, from Nekat, in the same room.  Good XP and it’s followup quest gives you free food.  Shriveled Mummy Skin!  Yummy.  Once you have killed 100, you should have collected 50 ardent bond crystals as well.  Get your hilt from Berakut, then head back down to the floaty head.<br />
  <br />
The Missing Shards – Level 47<br />
  From here, you need to collect 5 Fragments and 3 Shards of Arzamus each.  (Remember I told you to start collecting them earlier?)  There are a couple of “easy” ways for this.  3 Named mobs can spawn in the entry room, if you clear it over and over and over and over and over and over and…  er…  you get the point.  Secondly, go west from Lord Neferset, and you will start seeing some 4 dot mobs.  Down here you run into some of the “real” named, which drop phat lewtz, as well as 3 Frags/Shards.  I prefer this way, myself.<br />
  <br />
Rebuilding The Weapon – Level 48<br />
  Talk to the head again!  Whee.  Now, this quest will ask you to recharge the weapon with the flares of the Tehetamini.  Easy peasy.  Talk to him again and he will teleport you and your group (so make sure everyone is ready to go) to a temple.  RIGHT CLICK THE FLARE.  This will give you a quest for the Flare, by killing the 4 guardians.  So, go to each corner of the temple, and kill them 1 at a time.  4 dot, level 48?  I think.  Easy as pie.  Once you have all 4, go right click the flare to finish the quest.  Then you equip the weapon, and right click it with the flare in your inventory.  You (and your group) get ported back to the floaty head.  TALK TO HIM.  Now, he says it’s done.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Imbuing Arazmus – Level 49<br />
  Omg, it’s… not over yet.  Go speak to Handler Aerco, and he will offer you an upgrade for 20 bags.  Remember those bags?  Joy.  20 more for the upgrade!  Wait, it’s still.. just… a yellow weapon.  &lt;sobs&gt;  Oooh, another upgrade you say, Handler Aerco?<br />
  <br />
Um.  No quest really.  Oracle Event! – Level 50<br />
There is no quest for the next part.  Sorry folks.  However – there is a lovely ring event!  I hope you (or someone in group at minimum) has collected an Eye of Zukayr ring, from mobs in Rahz.  Otherwise the next part will be very very hard.<br />
  <br />
  Go to the tower in Rahz (I assume you’ve been up here before).  Clear the mobs (Razthil at a minimum).  See the big circle with all the lovely marks on the floor, and words pop up in yellow?  That, my friends, is a summoning circle, for the Oracle of Fire, Zukayr.  Awesome, eh?  Hail Dynahs.  You are now the only person allowed to summon the oracle.  Fear your power.  I would suggest bringing a second group to help, honestly.  It CAN be done with 1 group, but it’s uber hard.<br />
  <br />
  Equip the Eye of Zukayr.  Hail the essences of the oracle, and receive 3 essences.  There are three rings to the summoning circle.  Start at the outside ring, and go around, until a name pops up in red instead of yellow.  Oh noez!  A mob has spawned!  Someone kill it!  You get 2 mobs per ring.  They spawn 1 at a time, easy peasy.  When you are not in combat, look down at yer feet, and position yourself in the middle of the mark.  Right click the essence to drop.  Continue around the circle, you will find 3 that turn red, and you have 3 essences.  Amazing coincidence.  Go hail Dynahs, he will check your work.  If you do well, he says “on to the second ring.”  If you don’t, he shoots fireballs at someone in the tower, and it’s not you.  Nice, eh?  Get more essences, this time 2 green ones.  Middle ring, same thing happens, this time geckos, instead of floating djinns.  Talk to Dynahs again, he checks your work, you win or lose, etc.  Third time’s the charm!  Get blue essences, do the inner ring, kill the birds that spawn, but DO NOT CHECK YOUR WORK YET!  Kill Razthil again!  Now check your work.  OH NOEZ.<br />
  <br />
  Now the actual event starts.  Do not stop killing, there is a 30 minute timer, I believe.  We left a mob up to kill respawns and the wisps all despawned and we had to start over.  4 level 48 4 dot mobs spawn.  They rush the WISPS.  SAVE THE WISPS!  One wisp must survive until the end of the encounter so that the Oracle spawns.  The more wisps die, the harder the event gets.  I suggest you get Zullbane Serums from Grand Provisioner Something in Afrit, and mez 2 per round, burning the other 2.  Your tank CANNOT use AE taunt on the mobs, as they will not agro him (they keep beating on the wisps) AND he agroes the wisps!  The wisps don’t do any damage, but they lock you in combat.  So sad.  After you finish off those 4 efreetis, a very very brief respite happens, and the portal intensifies!  4 level 50 4 dot mobs spawn.  Same thing.  Keep the wisps alive!  Third wave now.  4 level 52 4 dots.  Rinse, repeat.  I would suggest some remezzing on the last wave, which will require multiple people to have the mez pots.  If you have ONE wisp surviving, you get the oracle now.  Level 48 6 dot.  Piece of cake.  Right click the ghostie.  You now have your glowy orange heroic weapon.  Tada!<br />
  <br />
  There are rumors of a way to upgrade it one more time to legendary.  This is not in the game yet.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zincarla Khazidhea</div><div class="date">08-20-07, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just about done with this quest, and believe me when I say, don't waste your time trying to farm bags and stones outside Rhaz. If you and your friends can handle it, start the helm quest and while you do the steps of that inside Rhaz, bags will drop much faster. As well you get &quot;Powerful Efreeti Cards of Fate&quot; that can give a bag, 10-25 stones, or a bounty quest that results in 3 bags.<br />
<br />
While you go through the steps of the helm quest, you will be obtaining items necessary to summon mobs (also for helm quest), but each of these named mobs drops 3 bags and 3 powerful cards of fate. In the later steps of the quest, bags will be dropping like candy. We actually got 48 bags in about 3 hours the other night from summoning and killing nameds. You have to farm and kill a lot of named anyways for the legendary helm, so you will be getting tons of bags. You may as well do the quests simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Oh btw, does anyone know if the final version looks like the Arazmus Shiv version? Also, does it have a particle effect?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah because the damage numbers are within one point of each other. but still looking to upgrade to a longsword or Shortsword for main hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mebble</div><div class="date">08-22-07, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah the afrit weapon dagger is barely better then the graystone one dmgwise so i went with the axe instead until i get tier 5 crafted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PsiKoTicK</div><div class="date">08-22-07, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But the dagger outdamages the axe, because of the consistent numbers instead of one huge hit and then one wimpy hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been my experience.<br />
<br />
If you equip an axe/dagger, you will see your overall damage rating (the mainhand and offhand spread) go far beyond what any dagger/shortsword or even longsword is capable of.<br />
<br />
In the reality of combat, this translates literaly into huge numbers when using specials, especialy shank/shiv.<br />
<br />
At the time I did the weapon quest, I choose (to my eventual dismay) the shortsword. So I was using the Arazmus shortsword and the Crystal blade from the 6 dot named in graystone. I thought things were going great.<br />
<br />
I had high DPS weapons, and my damage had gone up vs the crystal dagger/graystone dagger.<br />
<br />
Then I won a roll on Djarns Longsword of Accuracy.  Was better but didn't seem THAT much better stat wise. Yet when i equipped it, I Immediately noticed a large increase in damage rating, and in actual numerical output, from special attacks.<br />
<br />
Not long after, my Guild awarded me a crafted t5 Axe (Flawless cavalier's jagged axe of striking) and my damage EXPLODED.  Hundreds more per regular hit and THOUSANDS more on crits.<br />
<br />
I mentioned this to several of our offensive fighters (bards, rangers, another rogue) so they switched to axe as well and also immediately noticed massive damage increase. I have since picked up a t5 hammer and its even better, tho not by a massive margin over the axe.<br />
<br />
Remember that VG does not have any true dual wield, that your weapons are sort of averaged (not exactly, its like 70% main and 30% off?? not at all sure about that, but its something like that) and then its all treated basicaly as a two handed attack.  Thats why you always miss with &quot;both&quot; or hit with &quot;both&quot; or crit with &quot;both&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then also keep in mind that weapon speed (and haste) only affect autoattack.  Your specials of course only rely on their own refresh rates or global refresh, and Completely ignore weapon speed.<br />
<br />
With these things in effect, they literaly skewed the game against small fast weapons (other than the +5% chance to crit) and hugely in favor of high damage weapons, whatever the speed. (after all, when was the last time autoattacking a mob honestly had much actual impact on a fight, solo OR grouped?)<br />
<br />
Two small damage fast weapons cannot compete in raw, special attack spamming battles with a super high damage rating weapon (axe or hammer) paired with the dagger we need to use our backstab abilities.<br />
<br />
A lame, because I don't have the exact percentages handy and am certainly no math wiz, example might be (focusing on our special attacks, where the meat of our damage comes from):<br />
<br />
Dagger 10 damage  70% = 7<br />
Dagger 10 damage  30% = 3<br />
Damage for special attacks= 10<br />
--------------------------------<br />
Hammer 20 damage 70% = 14<br />
Dagger 10 damage 30% = 3<br />
Damage for special attacks=17<br />
<br />
Now for those real number crunchers:<br />
Flawless Cavalier's Jagged Hammer of Striking has a damage range of 138-257<br />
Flawless Cavalier's Jagged Dagger of Striking, best dagger ive seen in game, has a range of 131-160<br />
Flawless Caalier's Jagged Axe of Striking 111-260<br />
Djarns longsword of accuracy 125-188<br />
Arazmus, Xiphos of Slaughter 102-153<br />
<br />
As I see it, and as I've experienced it, two daggers, or dagger and shortsword, or even dagger and longsword, cannot compare, at all, to dagger and hammer or axe. Can't even come close.<br />
<br />
Those gaps in the damage ratings, when multiplied by whatever modifiers they have when you fight, amount to literaly thousands of damage more with critical specials and hundreds more non-critical. The most significant gap in damage is with shank/shiv.<br />
<br />
Imagine if we could wield two Hammers like Rangers or two Axes like Bards... (tho the crit chance would be hard to give up hehe)  <br />
<br />
I hope I have explained my thoughts and experiences well. I'm not attacking anybodies playstyle only laying out what I have noticed.<br />
<br />
I r sleep now, work in 3 hours ugh.<br />

Exactly, this is why I always complain about rangers outdamaing us.  They are free to use two t5 hammers while we are stuck with only the abillity to use one and have to have a dagger in the offhand to use our more powerful abilities.  When choosing a weapon, you go off weapon damage.  The damage that rogues squeeze out in this game is 90% specials which ignore weapon delay and only focuses on weapon damage.  So for the same 10 endurance, you will hit much harder with an axe/hammer (making the generalization because axes/hammers usually have higher weapon base dmg) in your primary hand and a dagger in your off hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats what i get for taking so long to edit, too tired hehe<br />
<br />
But yeah I agree Mebble, thats why properly equipped bards/rangers can smear our damage a lot of the time.  They have to be properly equipped tho.<br />
<br />
A level 50 bard dual wielding two t5 crafted Axes (they dont get hammer skill) and spamming their TRIPLE $@#$@ 400% !!! zero refresh finishers blows me away. And I have better overall gear and great weapons. I'm just stuck with the dagger and he is not, plus his triple finishers smoke my stupid 350% double finishers. (with full lucent/gorg swamp gear the loss of the 5% crit rate seems unnoticeable when giving up the fast offhander) <br />
<br />
I wont even go into ranger.</div></div><hr />

As I see it, and as I've experienced it, two daggers, or dagger and shortsword, or even dagger and longsword, cannot compare, at all, to dagger and hammer or axe. Can't even come close.<br />
<br />
Those gaps in the damage ratings, when multiplied by whatever modifiers they have when you fight, amount to literaly thousands of damage more with critical specials and hundreds more non-critical. The most significant gap in damage is with shank/shiv.<br />
<br />
Imagine if we could wield two Hammers like Rangers or two Axes like Bards... (tho the crit chance would be hard to give up hehe)  <br />
<br />
I hope I have explained my thoughts and experiences well. I'm not attacking anybodies playstyle only laying out what I have noticed.<br />
<br />
I r sleep now, work in 3 hours ugh.<br />

See everyone one of my parses on axe dagger combo come out with exact oppsite results. and i had people parseing me and i was consistently out dpsing there axe dagger combo. with the low range being so low. My dps jumped significantly with dagger dagger. though its actully better to throw a long sword or short sword because you do lose a touch of dps to dual daggers but still my parses, and a fellow guildies parses of me show i out dps Axe dagger combo consistantly. Sure if you want big flashy crit number go axe but over time the dagger dagger will out damage the axe dagger combo. the smallare range of the damage numbers but the higher base is what keeps my htis consistanly outdpsing the axe dagger combo. but than againi wont pay for a crafted t 5 axe so i dont know the base number on that. Everythign i parsed off of was Dropped weapons. <br />
<br />
And if your complaing of rangers out dps yong heh, I dont know what you are doing wroung than. I have never come across a ranger that i have parsed against myself that has ever outdpsed me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceradaxas</div><div class="date">08-23-07, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the good t5 crafted axes/hammers are significantly better than any dropped axes/hammers that I have ever seen. The closest axe I know of is the dreadbringer one out of Rahz and that one is much less damage than the crafted one.  I hear the Queen in Ichy drops some axes but never seen them drop any time I've killed her.<br />
<br />
I feel for you on the buying of the crafted weapons, its rediculous.  If I had to buy my crafted gear I'd never touch the stuff myself. Wouldn't be able to afford one piece and I refuse to buy gold. <br />
<br />
Luckily our guild has awsome crafters and we all work very well together harvesting/deconning and we are all pretty much decked out 100% in whatever flawless crafted we want at no cost.<br />
<br />
Dunno why I even made the ranger comment, I was so tired.  Maybe resentment that they sneak as well as we do? lol.  You're right tho, I haven't really been out-dps'd by a ranger in a long time.<br />
<br />
I really can't see how dagger/dagger can out damage axe/hammer or dagger, when the minimum damage of the big weapon is near or above the minumum of the dagger and the maximum is well over 100 points higher. (I espcialy love my new hammer, 138-257 is better in eery way to any dagger or short sword that exists in the game to my knowledge. And its even over 70DPS, so its damage/speed ratio even rocks for autoattack, not that autoattack matters)<br />
<br />
But as you said, my experiences are all with the crafted t5 flawless, and therefore prolly not very standard to what most are using.<br />
<br />
Do we have a non super complicated parser yet? I'd love to run the numbers myself so I can post real data for you guys.  I understand my thoughts/experience is really just blather until I can back it up with data.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my opinions and for replying Dikaman.</div></div><hr />

There must be something wrong with your parses or some hidden combat mechanic then.  It does not make sense logically that two daggers could outdamage a dagger and hammer t5 combo.  <br />
<br />
Flawless Cavalier's Jagged Hammer of Striking has a damage range of 138-257<br />
Flawless Cavalier's Jagged Dagger of Striking, best dagger ive seen in game, has a range of 131-160<br />
<br />
If you just simply look on the base damages, the hammer has a slightly higher low end base damage and shows an extreme difference in the high end range of damage.  It just dosent make sense that a dagger could even come close to the damage that the hammer can output even over a long fight.</div></div><hr />

You missed one very important thing. I never tested against crafted</div></div><hr />

Cause frankly i really dont have the hook ups to get crafted wepons at a resonable price. I could afford one weapon if i sold my caraval but thats only a last resort.</div></div><hr />

First try we killed all the waves and killed the oracle, but either the gravitron effect or the fire pulse effect prevented me from being able to absorb the essence from the Oracle's body. Very annoying to get through it all and not be able to complete the action/harvesting bar to finish the quest.<br />
<br />
We did it again, and this time the gravitron never went off despite giving the message. Made the event incredibly easy when you aren't constantly getting sucked to the center of the circle. Think we only lost 2 wisps on that second event and I was able to complete the Arazmus Dagger, which was way better than anything I had. I'll keep an eye out for an axe or Djarn's longsword for some testing.<br />
<br />
All in all, it was pretty fun event and different from the normal stuff we do. Also, its my first particle effect weapon!</div></div><hr />

And yes, hence, rangers who can weild two of them have a big advantage.<br />
<br />
Dik, I thoroughly recommend you test DPS in these combinations because the requirement to use a weak dagger combined with 300% and 400% criticals vis a vis 400% and 500% criticals say which we could instead get to compensate, means that we fall behind better geared rangers and bards.... each of who crit 'all the time' as well.  My good mate is a ranger and he spends most of all fights doing criticals (if I remember correctly, his crit chain is 3 steps long as well whereas ours is two).  We can trigger crits for the group now, warriors can, we debuff the mob making it more prone to crits etc etc... so causing criticals is not really a big deal for others, it's how you capitalise on them.  Bring in rapiers to give us an option of a piercer that is slow....<br />
<br />
Generally, world dropped weapons are decon bait.  I love Djarn's longsword - a great decon.</div></div><hr />

He is using Arazmus and the Greystone dagger.  I have a little over 1p to my name, because I got lucky on a shaman spell drop, sold it for 1p.  I bought a horsie instead of questing, but someone else paid for it.  I spent about 30g on the horseshoes, saddlebags, and barding.<br />
<br />
I have no way of paying the 4-5 plat people want for a t5 weapon.  The only way I could get one made, even in guild, where we have a level 50 weaponsmith, is to get the dust/powder whatever (I don't remember right now, haven't logged in for about a month - gogo moving screwing my life) for at least 2-3 plat.  Now, server merges happened, so for all I know it's cheaper now, and I might be able to afford it.  &lt;shrugs&gt;<br />
<br />
It's still not necessarily viable.  I am happy with my setup, but I'd love a GOOD valid parser.  I would love to see a DPS difference, and not one that goes &quot;well, I'm pretty sure this is your damage.&quot;  I know that's a logging issue, and not anything against the parser coders.</div></div><hr />

Which server are you on?<br />
<br />
On Xeth I was expecting prices to skyrocket, but they've stayed relatively sane (except for guildhall stuff of course). I got my Flawless Cav's Jagged Hammer of Striking for 40g and an embersteel ore, and my Flawless cav's dagger of striking was 1p. Even the t5 flawless endurance regen legs are only 1p.<br />
<br />
Best way i've found to get money (and they way I caught up with people after the merge) was to camp Rottentooth and decon everything for dusts. While I never got Resonating Recovery, Focusing Pain, or leet dusts like that, I did regularly get dusts that would sell for 5-20g and only rarely got totally worthless dusts (off the uncommon decons). Oh, and the Shimmering Spheres of pure matter/magic also sell very well, usually for 2g each.<br />
<br />
It's not difficult to make money, but you need to go out and farm for it. Don't expect to make much gold in a group, even if youve got lucky dice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not on Xeth. Here's a list of what i've paid for the gear i've bought since merge:<br />
<br />
Flawless Cavaliers Jagged Hammer of Striking: Adamantine Ore (60g from exchange) + 40g<br />
<br />
Flawless Cavaliers Dagger of Striking: 1p on exchange<br />
<br />
Flawless Pariahs Jagged Tunic of the Marked: 1p on exchange<br />
<br />
Flawless Cavaliers Boots of Celerity: Pristine Hide (harvested) + 25g<br />
<br />
Flawless Assassins Rock Light Crossbow: 1.2p<br />
<br />
Flawless Cavaliers Jagged Leggings of Recovery: Traded Focusing Crystal of Pain for them<br />
<br />
Flawless Pariahs Belt of Celerity: 80g on exchange<br />
<br />
These aren't friend prices or anything. The prices on Xeth aren't anywhere near what they are on the other servers apparently, even with the influx of duped plat from.. I think it was Thunderaxe that had the worst duping.</div></div><hr />
