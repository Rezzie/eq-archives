I got it, hotkeyed it and everytime i press the key it says I have to choose a direction.<br />
<br />
How exactly do I do this? I have mouse clicked and hit about every darn button i could think, including compass points.<br />
<br />
Granted most stealthers I have asked about this say they dont know how to do it either/its useless but I do want to at least try it at some point.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cirad11</div><div class="date">03-27-02, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello. I am a lvl 37 shadowblade on the Percival server and I use distraction all of the time in PvE. Ok, here is my senario as to how it works.<br />
<br />
I choose a target. Follow it unil it stops. I am on the backside of the target but I want to get a Perf off so I have to be infront right? So you hit the Location button...NOT THE SAME AS THE /loc COMMAND. I believe it is set to F8 normally, but check your keyboard settings to make sure of this. Anyway, if you hit the correct key and hold it down you will see a yellow cursor on the ground under you. You can move this cursor with the arrow keys as to where you want it. For this hunting style tho it is best to leave it directly below you. So you hold down the button, the cursors pop up, then you release it and immediatly hit your distraction button. If you did it correctly it should say something like &quot;You throw a small stone and it makes a faint noise on the ground.&quot; The mob that you are behind will hear it and turn to face wherever your cursors were positioned. In this case straight towards you so you can get your Perf off. That is how it works, but it has no purpose in RvR it only works against PvE. I hope I explained it clear enough, kinda hard to do without haveing the game in front of me   Hope this works for you. Just give it a try, I love it!<br />

The first time you use it on them, things will stop walking and turn to face the noise.  Only works once or twice for that, but occasionally useful.<br />
<br />
Technically no use in RvR... .but if you're watching a couple of people just standing around and want them to move, toss a rock at them.  They usually get all fidgety after that.    Ciardha Sidhe, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sljivarion</div><div class="date">03-28-02, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The key is F5 and the way you select a location on the ground is by pressing and holding F5 and then using your arrow keys on the keyboard.  It takes some getting used to.  When you have the desired location targeted, depress F5 and then press and release it once again.  If you don’t press and release, the yellow location indicator will slowly fade away.  When you are done, to remove the yellow location indicator, press and release F5 once again and the indicator will fade away.<br />
<br />
My experience with this in PvE has been mixed.  It seems that if you turn your mob so you can PA easily, your PA will fail.  I think it is more likely to fail if you PA immediately after you turn the mob.  But if you wait to long (10 sec or so) the mob will go back to what he was doing and you may get the mob to turn away from you just as you press the PA key.  However, if you are hunting with a NS friend (which I often do), if one NS turns the mob with distract and the other PA’s, the PA will succeed.<br />
<br />
Another use for distract ability is to avoid detection.  I used it more than once while going in and out of the CM pit.  The way it works is that you turn the mobs that are facing your path so that they have much less chance of detecting you (i.e. you set it up so you go behind them).  You also use it to stop the roaming mobs from crossing your path.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<br />
I used distract once and ONLY once so far entire RvR. Basically a group of 4 yellow/blues...<br />
<br />
Waste of life ta try they would beat me down; time for patience. They musta been waiting to meet a group and we all know how that can drag. <br />
<br />
Say, 10 minutes later, me patience evaporated, I threw the distract just to &quot;spook&quot; em... was actually walking away stealth and camera panned....<br />
<br />
LMAO the fools &quot;split up&quot; to look for me  ))<br />
<br />
Aye; I got the one hunter who stealthed over past the tower to check for me there. He was down and I was gone before his mates figgered where he was down. I doubt this trick would work on any noobs now; with the 3 BGs the &quot;noobs&quot; entering at L35 the big pool are gonna have a LOT more savvy then the old way...<br />
<br />
Still I hadda laugh, was like a cheap &quot;B&quot; grade horror film when the house is haunted and people &quot;split up&quot; to check it out.<br />

<br />
Try F5 to bring up the distraction target.  If that doesn't work, try shift+t.  If THAT doesn't work, go check your options&gt;keyboard configuration to see what key your ground target ability is bound to.</div></div><hr />
