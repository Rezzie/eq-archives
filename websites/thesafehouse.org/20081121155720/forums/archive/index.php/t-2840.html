 What it does:  <br />
  <br />
 The disarm skill allows a rogue to fling a NPC's weapon to the ground or in the case of PvP, to a character's inventory.  You can NOT disarm a magical weapon from a NPC. <br />
  <br />
 How to use it:  <br />
  <br />
 1. First, you must be within melee range of your target. <br />
 2. Use the skill; either click the Disarm button or use an assigned hotkey.  <br />
  <br />
 Notes:  <br />
  <br />
 You would think that disarming the weapon of an enemy would always be desireable.  However, sometimes the creature will be MORE effective at hand to hand than with the weapon, thus you DON'T want to disarm unless you like making things more difficult.  An average creature has a hand melee delay rating of about 30, but their damage is not effected by what type of weapon that they are carrying. So if you are fighting a monster that is using a fast weapon, such as a dagger, or scimitar, disarming them would be a good idea, whereas a monster with a slow weapon such as a two handed sword or an orc with an orc pick, disarming them actually makes them more effective. Some creatures get bonuses with particular weapon types and are more effective, or hit for maximum damage more often with particular weapons, so it would be a good idea to disarm those creatures when you see them with that weapon type. An example would be Crushbone Orcs with Scythes, or Aviaks from South Karana with maces.  <br />
  <br />
 Tips:  <br />
  <br />
 To practice this skill easily, try it on a Necro or SK pet that is carrying a weapon.  Give the weapon back and repeat.  This does not work on magician or enchanter pets, however. Zato Thornblade the Dwarven Rogue <br />
