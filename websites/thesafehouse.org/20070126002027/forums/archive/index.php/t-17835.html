<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quietpaws</div><div class="date">03-12-05, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most people know about talents and their abilities, or at least learn them after time, but there is a few other things not directly related to abilities and such. I will throw a few down here, and would love to hear more such tricks from the old battlescarred members. 1 LOS &amp;lt;line of sight&gt; I see people all the time who forget enemies cannot hit what they cannot see, by this I mean hiding behind solid objects, using stealth and then going into a tree or bush that will screen you from direct observation. You can then use your views &amp;lt;mouselook&gt; to observe the area. 2 Size of your name, your name appears in big red letters to enemy factions, yet I still see people with names like 8 or more letters long, use a 2 or 3 letter long name, even if stealth breaks,  if you are hidden they  &amp;lt;might&gt; not see you unless you have a HUGE name. 3 Know the zone you are in, if you are in a PvP fight, you will not be standing still &amp;lt;unless you want to lose&gt; Know the zone well enough to not aggro mobs, or if you cannot avoid aggro, try and get your opponent aggroed and not you.............Just a few basic tips, I know there is more and better out there, hopefully some will be posted</div></div><hr />
