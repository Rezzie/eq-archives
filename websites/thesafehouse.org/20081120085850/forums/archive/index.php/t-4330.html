<br />
So far I can use staves or unarmed combat. I have a dot, buff, damage shield, healing spell, regen spell and outright damage spell so far. I find at least at my level I can spend half a fight doing spells and half doing melee or just do one damage spell once, then melee the rest (with regen on me).<br />
<br />
At level 10 I get a spell that will let me turn into a bear. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_MinionOfCthulhu</div><div class="date">04-25-04, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've only gotten my druid up to 18, so I'm not an expert or anything, but I'll share my druidic experiences so far.<br />
<br />
First off, they are a leather class, and can use a rather suprising range of weapons. They start off with staves learned, but can choose to learn daggers, unarmed weapons (claws and such I suppose, haven't seen any drop though..), spears, and axes of both one and two-handed variaties. They get bear form at level 10, aquatic form at level 16, cat form at level 20 and travel form at level 30.<br />
<br />
In his normal form, the druid has a lot of nifty spells avaliable. Most of them are instant cast, which is rather nice because it's really easy to have spells be interrupted. I won't name all the spells, but some of my favorites include Rejuvination, a heal over time; Faerie Fire, an armor debuff that nullifies the ability to stealth or turn invisable (Can't wait to try this out in duels against rogues...); and Mark of the Wild, a superb buff that raises both armor and every stat. Good stuff.<br />
<br />
As for the animal forms, well, to be honest I don't have a lot of knowledge about them. Bear form has the potential to be powerful, but I don't use it all that often. My Shapeshift skill is pretty low, so the bonus hitpoints I get from being a bear is fairly low. However, the skills bear form allows are pretty solid. It can taunt, hit everything around it, stun, lower the damage of everything around it, generate rage at the cost of a big hit to my armor (Yep, bears use rage just like warriors) and more. Plus it looks pretty neat. <br />
<br />
Aquatic form is fairly straightfoward. You don't get any abilities, but you can breathe water and swim faster then normal. Not fantastic, really, but nice to have. <br />
<br />
I don't have cat form yet, but it seems to mimic the rogue class quite well, even going so far as to allow abilities to gather combo points. Doesn't hurt that it looks pretty slick, too. Kind of small though.<br />
<br />
Travel form is something I am both highly looking foward to and a bit dissapointed about. It allows you to run faster, how much faster, I do not know, but running faster is always nice. However, it looks like a plain ol' moonstalker, which are a sort of leapordy sabertooth cat. Yawn. Just got a cat form! I sent a /suggest that it should be changed to something neater, maybe a Plainstrider/Foreststrider appearance, or Stirgid Owls/Condors. <br />
<br />
That's all that comes to mind. Druids are neat, but so far I like the actual druid far more then his animal forms, but then again, I haven't gotten cat form yet. Nil Mortifii Sine Lvcre <br />

Paladins have auras, which sadly can't be twisted. :)<br />
<br />
Aside from the above, the only thing ive noticed about the Druid is the number of spells they do get.  Druids get dang costly, due to the number of spells they have to train.  Thats probably my only gripe about the druids.  Otherwise they rock.</div></div><hr />
