I think Infogrames is making a mistake pricing the game so high.  I held off buying Planescape Torment for 2 years because it never went down in price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't have too much of a problem paying $55 for it, I'm pretty happy with it.<br />

Would have been even more if I had of imported it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">07-12-02, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now the potential remains just potential.  Without a good batch of opening sales, the game is not going to have the user base to stay around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heck, for 60 bucks, if I can get 10 or 12 hours of enjoyment out of something it's about the same as a movie   Llabaktharr Gigglegiggler<br />

Some seriously good fun. I spent 9 hrs. playing Thursday night, had a blast &amp;amp; I was not tired like I usually am after doing the same amount of time on EQ.<br />
<br />
Being a weakling ( 67 hp, 14 str w/o gear) the game is a bit more challanging foir me. Plus, I am doing alot of the side quests in game, so slower advancement of overall plot.<br />
<br />
I paid $54.99. That's 1 week of fast food and junk food money. A good trade off for me!</div></div><hr />

Can't complain.. that's about 8 tickets to the cinema. And it took me more than 50-60 hours to finish the solo-campaign. ShadowCross Bladesong<br />
