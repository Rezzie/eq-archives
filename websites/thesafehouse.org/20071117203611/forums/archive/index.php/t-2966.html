Ok, my DM presented to me this (magic) door wich I'm having some difficulties to get through.<br />
It's a double door, wich on the right door it says &quot;Everything&quot; and on the left door it says &quot;Nothing&quot; and there is this 8x8 square system on them equally divided half and half (8x4 + 8x4).<br />
This is in LOTR btw, so it's 2d10 system and such.<br />
Now, if I touch a square and &quot;use magic item&quot; I find myself on the square itself standing there like a miniature and when I use it again I get back to where I was before. <br />
This door is very frustrating and getting on my nerves, came here in hopes that you could add your thoughts to this in hopes of a solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Turlo</div><div class="date">07-21-02, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">8x8 is the size of a chessboard.  And the fact that you teleport to the square the size of a minature...<br />
<br />
Perhaps calculate where you are at on the board, and move accordingly.  Perhaps by &quot;winning&quot; the game, you can open the door.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Turlo</div><div class="date">07-22-02, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But you are the movable piece.  Perhaps just try to move across from one side to another?  Or perhaps leave an item there, then teleport back.  That item then performs as that piece.<br />
<br />
Wife added a little piece.  She said you should start on the nothing side, move as the piece (and possibly as checkers, not chess), and get to the end of the everything side.  Something may trigger.
