<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mizrach UnderpantsGnome</div><div class="date">07-12-02, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone else ever have the problem of just playing the game, and then all of a sudden you load your saved game and EVERY NPC hates you and wants you dead?<br />
<br />
Me and my friend have been playing multiplayer for awhile now and one day (on chapter 2) I load my saved game which was in the troll/ogre cavern and my henchman (Tomi) starts attacking me the second i enter the game. So i reload my game...use my recall stone when he starts attacking me, and when i get to the town EVERY person there wants to kill me. So i reload AGAIN, and this time i kick the crap out of Tomi...use my recall stone and now everything is fine......<br />
<br />
So now i hire another henchman (the barbarian). Play the game for a few hours, do all the druid town quests, go back to the druid town to complete the quests and EVERY druid in the camp wants us dead!?!?! WTF!? So, naturally, i kick the crap out of my henchman. (hey it worked before) But this time it doesn't work. We go up to town, everyone hates us, we go to the druid town, everyone hates us.<br />
<br />
So now, very pissed off, we decide to start the game over, make new characters, and NEVER hire a henchman. (cause we thought they were what was causing this crap) So we are now playing thru chapter 1 again....we are about level 4...my friend uses his stone to go back to town and BAM! EVERYONE hates him   We have since stopped playing NWN because there is simply nothing we can do anymore. We can't play if all the quest/plot people want to kill us. Anyone else experience this?</div></div><hr />

Most recent was in single player and my henchmen (Linu) suddenly just up and attacked Jax the archaeologist guy near the barracks in east road.  Right after I finish talking to him (chose all 'nice' answers so it wasn't a matter of me attacking him).  <br />
<br />
I shrugged it off and kept going on the same game.  Let's hope he wasn't vital to the game      -- Squink McPoke, 60 Assassin, Lanys T'vyl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Turlo</div><div class="date">07-13-02, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my personal experience with this problem, it seems to be related to importing characters.  I have not encountered it if I use an imported character to start a new chapter, but had problems if I used it in middle of a saved game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loreleli</div><div class="date">07-13-02, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">check to see if Aribeth hates you, if she does, then you have a bug. If not, then it is faction - you did something or did nopt do something that made them dislike you. ( see spoilers about why...don't want to say too much, as this is not a spoiler thread.)<br />
<br />
check the bioware boards, they have a lot of posts regarding issues like this one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mizrach UnderpantsGnome</div><div class="date">07-13-02, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep...Aribeth hates us. And we didn't import any characters. They are brand new characters made on my LAN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elerion</div><div class="date">07-16-02, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then it's definitely a bug. Did you host both of these games? If you did, then try having your friend host one.<br />
<br />
If it's a known bug, you can most likely find an answer in the official forums. If it's not, reinstall to see if it helps. And of course, update to the newest version if you haven't already.</div></div><hr />
