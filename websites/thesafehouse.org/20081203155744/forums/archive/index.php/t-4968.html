Meaning does a higher skill allow you to stealth closer to your enemy?<br />
<br />
I just started an Infiltrator to play when the Friar/Wizard gets old.  So far I am only level 6, but I have not increased stealth at all (maxed out CS for Kidney Rupture).  I was just curious, because if it does, then I will put some points into it later.  If it doesn't, well, I will let it auto-train for a while =)<br />

The higher your stealth skill the closer to an enemy you can stealth and stay hidden as they walk by.  At 36 I can stealth about 5-10 feet from a blue mob.  (i don't know the exact range but it is relatively short)<br />
<br />
It also depends on the con of the mob.  you might be able to stealth right next to a gray but not be able to stealth 20 feet from a purple. Lohengrin <br />

<br />
When stealthed and standing still, i'm more readily observed as a ghost.  When moving, the radius to notice me is diminished.<br />
<br />
Is this due to server lag?<br />
