<br />
Let say for the CoD alt entrance quest, can person A hand 1 item, leave the group, the group invite somoene else and then hand in 3 other item work? (so, the group get key, person A don't)?<br />
<br />
is there some quest that can be MQ, but must be MQ in group?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

Some MQ's have had issues in the past with NPC's reacting to something one of the players happens to say during their MQ.  Most of those were old bugs though so I'm sure they're fixed by now.<br />
<br />
Just need to be sure MQ'ers both have the right faction and/or the appropriate level for the quest itself.  That's it.  Group if ya wanna group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is different than a regular MQ for an item, if your 5 friends want to get flagged for CoD also, then they need to be grouped. They do NOT need to be grouped if your only intent was to get the bangle.</div></div><hr />

Like for say start camping out, get to 5 seconds and then hit trade, then log in another character and finish it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise Manasponge</div><div class="date">11-22-03, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here's how MQing works. Say an Npc requires 4 items for the quest.<br />
<br />
Item1 = flag1<br />
item2 = flag2<br />
item3 = flag3<br />
item4 = flag4<br />
<br />
<br />
Now lets say you have 2 items on 1 char, 1 on another and the last piece on another.<br />
<br />
You hand in item1 and item3. The Npc now has set flag1 and flag3 to ON. <br />
<br />
Char 2 now hands in item2. Flag2 is now set to ON. So now to complete the quest all someone has to do is give the npc item4 and they will receive the reward. The last person to hand in is the one that receives the reward.<br />
<br />
You could turn in part of the items then log in another char for the rest. The only problem is if the npc gets reset (patch, zone crash, someone kills him). Otherwise the npc will be there waiting for the last item till they are reset.<br />
<br />
Screwy things can happen when someone comes by in the middle of a MQ and turns in all the proper items. Sometimes the MQ goes fine. others it seems that the npc ignores the dup'd items from the non MQ person gives them the reward and the dup'd items just poof.<br />
<br />
I had to do the EB neck in katta a second time and had been keeping the shis parts on various chars for MQs with guildees, so I went in with the pieces and turned in with the first char, then my main after to get the neck, but someone had given the npc some already and so the first char got the duplicate lore items msg and poof when neck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ancil</div><div class="date">11-22-03, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends what order the items get handed in.  Picture a 2-item quest.  You hand in item A, then log in your alt to hand in item B.  Unbeknownst to you, some guy comes by and does the quest.  There are two possibilities:<br />
<br />
1. If he hands in item B first, you'll never know it, and everything's fine.  The NPC says &quot;I have A and B, so here's your reward!&quot;.  Then the NPC gets item A (since the guy gave him both) and holds onto it.  When you log in, you hand over item B, and get your reward.<br />
<br />
2. If he hands in item A first, you get stiffed.  The quest NPC already had item A, so he just basically ignores it.  He takes item B from the guy and gives him the quest reward.  Now your alt logs in and hands over item B.  The NPC wil accept it, but still wants item A before you get your reward.  If you're super-lucky, item A is easy to get, and no one does the quest before you get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AsturiasAurora</div><div class="date">11-25-03, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually managed to MQ a pair of jboots with my alts.  Was a pain in the ass though keeping Hasten in place.   <br />
<br />
I parked my 3 alts involved at the tower on the HG hill there.  Then I logged in my ranger to track Hasten and snare him to aggro him up to near the tower, then rooted him there and quickly logged on my shaman to hand in the AC ring.  Then I had the shammy root him again and logged in my monk to hand Hasten the gold and rapier to get the boots.  It was a helluva gamble but thankfully my roots held in place long enough for me not to have to run 'too' far  <br />
<br />
....shame jboots suck these days though....but it's a good example</div></div><hr />
