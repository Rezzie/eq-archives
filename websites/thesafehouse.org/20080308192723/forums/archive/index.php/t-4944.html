<br />
Question 1<br />
If I train my stealth to 50, am i better than these who only train to 40 but with item and RP add it to 50 ??<br />
<br />
Question 2<br />
I hear that with enveom+ item, I can get the poison for the lvl after +item, if I only train to 14 and wear a +1 enveom item<br />
i can use lv15 poison, is this correct ??<br />
<br />
Question 3<br />
if Q2 is yes, do these apply to stealth ?<br />
if i train to 39 and wear +1 stealth item, do i get safefall 4 ??<br />
<br />

Is there absolutely ANY reason whatsoever that any 50 assassin class should train stealth above 39?<br />
I assume anyone who does is a fool.  Am I right? hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Wirt</div><div class="date">03-25-02, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Higher safefall. Perhaps new abilities added later. I, for one, am going to 50 stealth natural. But I believe I am a fool, and I'm not recommending this for others...I just like the idea of max stealth. =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
But have any quantifiable tests been done with someone at natural 50 vs a 39 with +11 bonuses?  I haven't seen any posts that show hard tests have been done.... <br />
<br />
Like a sprint test with both moving from point A to B at the same time to see if there is a difference in speed?<br />
Like facing each other and marking off when someone looses vision of the target?<br />
<br />
Dont know what else you can test that would show hard data here........ *shrug*<br />
<br />
<br />
... its just one of those things that is nagging me..... especially when i see all the great data on our damage in CS and poisons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kevintest</div><div class="date">03-26-02, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Yes - sort of.<br />
Stealth - and most skills - give a bonus by overspeccing.  It's a VERY small edge - not easily noticeable.  You can spot it by parsing damage logs sometimes.<br />
<br />
So if you have two L50 infils, one with 39 stealth and the other with 50 stealth, both with +10 in bonuses, the one with 50 base stealth will move faster and be harder to see.<br />
<br />
As a side note: it's very possible to get over +11 bonuses right now; it was recently revealed that item and RP bonuses to not add up to the item +11 cap.  A person can have +9 from RP bonuses (in theory, anyway - that would be a LOT of RPs!!!) AND still get a +11 from items - for a max total of +20.<br />
