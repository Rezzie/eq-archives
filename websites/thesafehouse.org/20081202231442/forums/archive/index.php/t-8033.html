<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_sashton</div><div class="date">10-02-02, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there anything that can improve your chances of a skill up when *applying* poison?  Rotating which poisons are used?  Dex/Int/Wis?  Every so-many points of damage inflicted?  Or is it possibly just a random chance every time you apply?<br />
<br />
I have gotten better - infrequently - on an apply immediately after a previous skill up.  More common is to go ten or twenty applies between points.  I'm using Snake/Spider/Grave Mold poisons in Unrest.<br />

I don't have it yet but I plan on going that route.  3AA points is nothin to me and I want to get poison mastery anyways.    <br />
<br />
Since I neglected poison for so long and powerskilled my poison making skills, this bonus from the AA skill will be quite nifty for me.<br />
<br />
As for getting skillups based on strange poison swapping things, etc... if it works anything like tradeskills just get yourself a KEI and Focus while working skills and have all the bases covered with stats.<br />

Edit: fixed the AA cost, was typed as 2, now corrected to 3. Jeno Ssyde<br />

You can skill all the way up on Snake Venom (or so I have heard). I'm at Apply of 110-ish and it has all been with that Spider Venom poison. In fact, be careful about swapping, since there are some limitations. At level 41 for example I could not apply Spirit of Sloth (with AP 100). Not sure how the limitations work yet, but don't go using Tier V right away thinking it will help. My advice, treat Apply Poison like Pick Locks. If you can apply the poison, you can get a skill up, so keep it simple.<br />
<br />
As for stats, I think it is like Make Poison (meaning INT, WIS or DEX). I get my best skill ups when I wear my DEX gear. Master Apothecary (200)<br />
