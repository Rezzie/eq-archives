I'm down with it.  It can't possibly get used less than the Pen and Paper forum(though we still need that!).<br />
<br />
Though, I wonder if such a forum is really in the spirit of the Safehouse, since Anime in general has nothing to do with Rogues....<br />

Don't feel you have to hold back about posting about it though, Logged Out is exactly for these kind of topics and in general I'd rather see anime topics over political ones in here ;)<br />

If Logged Out ever gets clogged because of it then we'll reconsider an entire forum for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good! You cut the list of 200,000,000 anime down to 180,000,000.Only 179,999,990 more to cut down before we can give you recommendations!<br />
<br />
The problem, I think, with not having anime forums and posting here (as I'm sure most other will agree) is that anime posts are usually made as &quot;per series&quot; basis. So, that alone means suddenly making 16 topics to flood the forums with, sans old series that are still airing form last season or two and series that have ended.<br />
<br />
So now we have about 50-60 series-specific threads. To add into the random anime posts and general discussion, we've got another 10 more just to begin with.<br />
<br />
That's why I feel that many don't want to post so much. To talk about 5-10 different anime gets very disorienting and feels like it's not on topic. For instance, the occasional &quot;new season&quot; post I do, usually lasts about 30 posts or so before dying out because it loses focus. But, the series-specific Naruto has been going 200+ posts and running.<br />
<br />
However, I guess instead of being all talk and no show, I should put some more effort into it. I'll try to see if I can do something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if we made a post for each anime title thus clogging up Logged Out, would that be grounds for an Anime Forum, or for a warning/suspension?  :b :kroe</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I think I'll do that then. See how that goes. It's quite a difficult thing to tackle, since there are many ways to review a series, all with their own flaws. The best way is a by-the-episode basis, but that makes it difficult to get a general review and it takes a lot of work. Another way is to review it after it's complete, but the people who watch a series to completion will be a little or heavily biased because, they wouldn't finish it if they didn't like it.<br />
<br />
And reviewing it before it finishes is unfair because it's not giving the whole series a chance. Oh well can't hurt to try.</div></div><hr />

I've actually been intendning to make one soon. The main reason for my reculance is because Kamichu! and Ichigo Mashimaro haven't been fansubbed very much. I wanted to wait until they get some more exposure before doing so. Maybe this weekend I will do it since both have at least 4 episodes subbed out already. And Mashimaro finally has a good group doing it.<br />
<br />
Oh, was also waiting on Petopeto-san.</div></div><hr />

1.  If post is by hor, med, kriz, and a few others Ignore<br />
2.  If last post is made by the above posters, Ignore<br />
3.  If post has the any words that deal with goverment Ignore.<br />

Its not that hard, and then I dont have to read a post that'll just get me agrivated seeing grown adults argue about something that wont even change anything instead of using that energy to actualy make a difference.<br />

So what do you all think about Koizumi's plan to privatize the postal service?  With his landslide win in the election over the weekend it seems almost a done deal, his party has two thirds of the lower house of parliament now, but I don't know about releasing that kind of 800-pound gorilla onto the market.  Just turning a government monopoly into a private monopoly isn't any kind of improvement, and this one has trillions in assets.  It will be a serious player on the world financial stage.<br />
<br />
Also, probably ninjas.</div></div><hr />

I pity you. My girlfriend actually watches so much more anime than I, that on several occasions I've pretty much banned her from continuing a series until I could catch up with her. She on average watches about 3-4 series for every one we finish together. Oh, how I love that in her. =-)<br />

Anime is really easy to understand, just equate them to major motion pictures. Major motion pictures are classified in various types. You have your &quot;actiony blow stuff up movies&quot; you have your &quot;creepy psychological thrillers&quot;, you have your &quot;artsy aesthetically pleasing films, usually about human drama&quot;, you have your &quot;too hardcore and graphic to release to theatre&quot; movies....<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, to bring that over to anime, take any one of those major types, and then add the following (although these are more stereotypical than descriptive)-<br />
<br />
-Magic<br />
-Ninjas<br />
-Giant Robots<br />
-Futuristic Society<br />
-Medieval Themes<br />
-Modern Society with a strange bent<br />
<br />
<br />
Anime isn't as easily classified as movies are. You can have a &quot;blow stuff up movie&quot; that's an anime, but it also addresses deeper questions of humanity (or maybe guys just have spikey hair and go &quot;AAAHHHHHH&quot; a lot). Anime tends to do a few things at once, at least, the quality anime does. The US has started cranking out a lot of 'anime light' lately, that's lite on art style, plot, ect.... That's a lot of what you're seeing on Kid's TV these days, and now it's spilling over into the 'adult' anime market, where these visually appealing anime are being produced that have the depth of a saturday morning cartoon. (And I'm looking at you, Scryed) <br />
<br />
<br />
If you want, and my experience with &quot;great&quot; animes is pretty limited, an anime that is non-typical (read as: no spikey hair, no Nuclear bomb-esqe super hero power imagery, no swords, no flashy combat scenes, no robots, no dragons, ect...) check out Paranoia Agent. (Although I guess according to what I just said, Paranoia agent has a lot of those things, in very very small doses). I think it's a great, serious anime with a clean art style and a story that bends your mind like a pretzel. For me, it typifies what anime can be when it isn't playing to the 10-18 demographic, or the hardcore anime otakus. I like Anime that is serious, that isn't kiddy or silly or over the top. The grimer, grittier anime is the type that I'm most drawn to.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for the record, I followed DBZ regularly as a younger adult. :P<br />
<br />
Disclaimer- I am not an otaku. Nor am I really even big on anime. So interpret these opinions as such, some of our more learned anime forum goers might have a largely different take on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And while I'm here...anime buffs. What do you guys think about the A-bomb motif that appears in at least 1/3 of all animes? Is that a super pervasive theme in anime in general?</div></div><hr />

If you liked Paranoia Agent you would prob love Monster. Very serious and dark. Lots of physiological/moral things you can ponder on.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately our friend, who has the netflix membership, was a bit bored because it didn't involve spaceships, fighting, babes/robots/babe robots with guns, or the like.  <br />
<br />
Is Paranoia Agent a turnoff for Otaku?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-16-05, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, otaku is not a strict definiton. Better way to think of it is:<br />
<br />
There are geeks. But you have subgenres of geeks. You have hardware geeks, game geeks, d and d geeks, math geeks, etc.<br />
<br />
Otaku is the same. Then when you get to anime otaku, you have various types. In japan, they don't ask if you are a fan of anime, like here. They ask, what genre of anime are you a fan of.<br />
<br />
The otaku of anime appreciate all things quality. So paranois agent would be appreciated by otaku, and fans of it's genre.<br />
<br />
Because of the fact anime has ambigious classifications, most are classified by age group. Hence shonen is young boys. Shoujo is young girls. Etc you'd probably do well to look for your own age group and you will probably find the more mature anime you want.<br />
<br />
Not neccessarily always the case, as pretty cure is aimed at young girls and has alarge 16 to 40 male fanbase.<br />
<br />
And nenjin is right about classifications. Anime is  not a genre, it is a type of entertainment like television, movie, books, etc. Pokemon and dbz are aimed at young kids, so of course it doesn't appeal to most adults.<br />
<br />
As for the spirit force, its a prevalent concept since the samurai times of intent to kill, sakkai, chi of buddhism, etc etc. It just got manipulated to be fun to see, instead of boring old men looking like they want to take a crap but can't.<br />
<br />
Also, one thing to consider is, Anime is really a very limited form of entertainment. It is limited by the number of viewers, budget, etc. But Manga is where it's at if you are REALLY looking for HQ stuff.<br />
<br />
Manga takes up 40% of all books in Japan. There's something for EVERYONE. Much unlike Anime, which often is only chosen to appeal to the largest audience. So it's very extreme in it's division. You have a crapload of anime for children (Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, Prince of Tennis, Pretty Cure, Cardcaptor Sakura, Sailor Moon, etc). Then you have a crapload of anime for Otaku (Tsukuyomi ~Moon Phase~ Shingetsutan Tsukihime, Ichigo Mashimaro, Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, Fate//Stay Night, Maria-sama ga Miteru)<br />
<br />
So it's very divided that way, often very little anime in the middle-ground gets released. Mostly because those two are the largest market, because of the anime stigma in Japan. Older people who watch anime are weird freaks who kill and rape little children. So only those who accept their passion are willing to watch it, and only children who havent grown up watch it.<br />
<br />
But, Manga is for everyone of all ages. There's no stigma involved. So it's much, much more diverse.<br />
<br />
As for recommendations, Paranoia Agent appears to be popular with the casual anime crowd, as mentioned above. You can't possibly go wrong with any of the recent Studio Ghibli films that have been released (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, My Neighbors the Yamadas, Pom Poko, Porco Rosso, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind)<br />
<br />
Other stuff to consider would be the lesser known Voices of a Distant Star, The Place Promised In Our Early Days. There's also Fullmetal Alchemist, but it does fit in your sterotypes very well, even though it's a superb anime with a lot to say. Another good one would be the Ghost in the Shell franchise, (Ghost in the Shell, Ghost in the Shell: Innocence, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Ghost in the Shell: 2nd Gig).<br />
<br />
There's really a lot. Human Crossings comes to mind too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-16-05, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take on (American) Anime Otaku is like this. They definitely know what they like, and they have seen practically everything that falls under the ruberic of 'anime'. And if they haven't seen everything, they are at least generally aware of most anime that is out right now, enough to the point that they have an opinion on it. Slightly different than the Japanese Otaku, who as Stalkyr said, make pretty sharp distinctions between the different genres in Anime. <br />
<br />
The reason, I think, average Joe american doesn't get Anime is because of the way it's presented here. You go to your typical video store, and all the anime is lumped under &quot;Special interest&quot; (or some such designation). So you'll have, say, Evangelion sitting next to Akira, sitting next to (damn, can't think of the name. Some anime with a big rose petal motif, sword fighting, and lots of effiminate men), sitting next to Furi Kuri. <br />
<br />
That's like taking Blockbuster's kid section, adult section, action section, and drama section, and listing all the movies from them in alphabetical order on the same rack. Americans who don't have a good grasp of anime can't untangle that, so they tend to look at anime, I think, as one homogenous type of entertainment, with the same themes and style, rather than a wide range of styles, themes, motifs, and flavors. And that's why it's hard for me to go out and pick out anime to watch.....I have very little clue exactly what type of movie I'm picking out from that rack, because Americans (other than specialty anime stores) don't take the time to distinguish between them.</div></div><hr />

Sorry if this is dumb but have to ask. So in Japan watching anime when your older is not really accepted? So when your older you are supposed to read Manga and that is treated as the norm?<br />
<br />
In the US older ppl reading Manga or watching anime gives us looks :P. We are a small % I suppose and I guess some don't see past the pOrn aspect of it. Or something like that :P.</div></div><hr />

It is TOTALLY socially acceptable in Japan for a 50 year old man to go to a theatre to see an anime entitled &quot;Happy Kitty Flower Princess&quot;. Like Stalkyr said, the anime that is intended for girls ages ~12+ has a huge following of older men over the age of 40. There are various reasons for that, some benign, some kind of icky, but either way, the Japanese don't stigmatize on the issue. The age ranges Stalkyr listed are more general guidelines.....but that's not to say a 12 year old boy might prefer deeper, more serious anime, while a 45 year old man prefers giant robot slugfests or DBZ style anime. (Or child-like female driven anime.........)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I hate to be picky, but the Japanese DO make it a social stigma. It is unacceptable for a 50 year old japanese man to see anything but Studio Ghibli films.<br />
<br />
Studio Ghibli is the only animation studio that is accepted by the general public. If a 50 year old Japanese man said to his co-worker, I went to see the Fullmetal Alchemist movie in theater the other day, he would be shunned as a social reject.<br />
<br />
A lot of the Anime stigma that exists is due to an isolated incident not that long ago, in the 80's. There's a long story, but a man kidnapped some children, mutilated and raped them before killing them, sent pictures to their families, apologized to them and proceeded to repeat the act to other children. It became a huge scare and eventually he was caught by a father who was nearby who almost had his daughter kidnapped.<br />
<br />
Upon entering his house, they found a lot of anime pedophilia called Lolicon. The japanese public associated anime with this incident, so Otaku do not tell anyone their interests, in fear of being shunned by their friends and family and co-workers. It is completely unacceptable for anyone but children to like anime, and everyone else to like anything but Ghibli.<br />
<br />
Despite all this, the Japanese like to wear masks at work, and never allow anyone to find out their true selves, and come home to watch anime all night to escape from the harsh reality. One of the many reasons why the Japanese Otaku love anime.</div></div><hr />

When you say Anime you mean the shows or Manga or Both? I kinda thought that the reading of Manga was pretty much excepted (all ages). I kinda knew that some anime (shows) where prob frowned on but seemed to me many accepted Manga reading. <br />
<br />
It is completely unacceptable for anyone but children to like anime, and everyone else to like anything but Ghibli.<br />
<br />
So this applys to both Manga and anime?<br />
<br />
Lol sorry its sorta confuseing in a way b/c i thought any Manga reading was pretty much acceptable and some anime was frowned on. But what happened in result of those murders seems extreme it must have been worse than what you have told us =/. Kinda feels like blameing GTA for all the killing on the streets and then shuning everyone who plays these types of games.</div></div><hr />

And it is a lot worse than I said, the mutilation was horrible and on tape, the families were terrorized and had any hope destroyed and the public was consumed with anger at the man's actions until he was caught.</div></div><hr />

Is this kinda the same point that Paranoia Agent was trying to get across except useing Paranoia? Kinda useing the maromi (sp) show as an escape of reality but in the end people had to face the reality? And when they had to relize that reality thus the Paranoia Agent came to end the pain. I dunno hehe i just see it as kinda the same in some weird way :P.</div></div><hr />

Well, seeing as I'm wrong on the issue, I wouldn't call it picky. The (limited) information I'd read on anime in the larger japanese culture said that there was no stigma attatched to grown men watching cartoons, or going to a theater to see a cartoon, so I kinda extended that to mean all anime. Somehow I guess I'm not surprised, because I always thought it odd how they wouldn't stigmatize 50 year old guys going to see anime with little girls.</div></div><hr />

The idea that &quot;It is TOTALLY socially acceptable in Japan for a 50 year old man to go to a theatre to see an anime entitled &quot;Happy Kitty Flower Princess&quot;&quot; is ridiculous. Such a person is still considered a wierdo by everyone sitting around him.<br />

Sad, 'cause all the better ones slip under the radar, in favor of chopped-up kiddy shows. Like what they did with One Piece.<br />
 <br />
Just don't make the first anime you try and watch be something like Neon Genesis Evangellion, aka The Most Controversial Anime Ever Created. That can ya off to all things anime pretty quick if it isn't your bag baby, yeah.<br />
 <br />
I suggest Cowboy Bebop, period. Cowboy Bebop is, imho, anime done 'right'. The North American version keeps all the laid-back feel, without resorting to forced humor, or dumbing down the dialog to make the plot 'more understandable' for a younger audience. 7 years after being produced, it has lost NONE of its appeal, unlike several other 'classic' series (like NG:E, imho). <br />
