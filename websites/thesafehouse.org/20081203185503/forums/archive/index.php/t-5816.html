<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remmi</div><div class="date">07-05-01, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seein' that I'm just a simpleminded ol' dwarf I ran into some confusion tryin' to donate to the CC with PayPal. Quit yer chucklin' back there--I heard that!! *Remmi scowls*<br />
<br />
So I asked the folks at ezBoard to thwap me and set me straight on it and here's what they said:<br />
<br />
 Thanks for pointing this out... we do need to adjust this window for contributions. For now you can enter the name and URL of the board to donate to (just fill it into the comments section) <br />
<br />
Basically, if ye click the PayPal method of payment all ye get is a window of instructions on how to send a payment via PayPal but the money DOES NOT automatically get credited to The Safehouse!! So please include the URL of the board in the comments (as described above) and ye should be okay. <br />
<br />
No stick yer paws deep into yer  own moneypouch fer a change and help us keep The Safehouse afloat!<br />
<br />
Thankee!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kezzek</div><div class="date">07-05-01, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The elder Tier'Dal casually grabs a dwarven helm from a nearby hook and plops it loosely on his head.  Falling to his knees, Kezzek wields a not-so-menacing soup ladel, crosses his eyes, and begins to waddle acroos the floor towards Remmi.  With a twinkle in his eye, Kezzek says,<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me where ta stab!  I'm old!  I'm a dorf!<br />
<br />
I gets so confuuuuuused!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kezzek begins knocking the soup ladel against Remmi's skull.<br />
<br />
CLONK.<br />
<br />
CLONK.<br />
<br />
With a roar, Remmi swings wildly at Kezzek, which the Tier'Dal deftly avoids.<br />
<br />
Kezzek leaps to his feet, claps the dwarven helm down over Remmi's eyes, tickles him under the chin and flees to the deeper recesses of the Safehouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remmi</div><div class="date">07-06-01, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remmi straightens his helm with a grumble and looks around for Kezzek to give him a good thwapping but he's already disappeared down the stairs to the Root Cellar. Remmi scowls.<br />
<br />
Presently a yelp of suprise and anger rises from the stairwell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe,&quot; chuckles the old dwarf as he tosses into the air a leather purse with the letters 'Kezz' written on it. Remmi (ornery dwarven rogue and thwapper of idjits!)<br />
