I know i can kill smuggler to get him to spawn, but is there any way to wait it out for a respawn? will he pop in any set time? thanks for your help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">06-25-03, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stanos is only triggered by saying &quot;i need to talk (or see?) to Stanos&quot; to Anson.<br />
<br />
Anson can have a PH. If there is a PH in his place, you'll have to kill that PH or you'll never see Anson (unless you wait for a server-reset or zone-reset).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_mengelt</div><div class="date">06-25-03, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was curious about this as well. I went to turn in one of my last pieces to get the box I need for the general spawn. I didn't want to get my guild in there to kill the place holder so I figured I'd wait till someone else kills the place holder. My only question is what makes anson despawn? If I wait until someone else kills his placeholder, and they turn in what they need to turn it to to Stanos, Anson will still be there waiting for me to spawn Stanos again... correct people?

Little bugger will come back if you wait a day I think. Either that or I got lucky. <br />
<br />
Hey has anyone tried asking Stanos about the General? He says he'd really like to know his name, wonder if you could find out his name and maybe get something else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm planning on killing the PH for Anson tonight and was wondering what the respawn time for him is?  Basically, when can I expect a respawn of that location when the PH goes?<br />
