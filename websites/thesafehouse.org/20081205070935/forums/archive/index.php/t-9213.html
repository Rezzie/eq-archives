<br />
From the FAQ: (http://www.blizzard.com/wow/faq/)<br />
&quot;Yes, you can also run the game in a window.&quot;<br />
<br />
2) How do you skin animals?  Do you need a taxidermy skill or something?<br />
<br />
That's all :)<br />
<br />
You need the SKINNING (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/tradeskills/skinning.shtml) tradeskill.<br />

Skinning is really easy, after find a trainer, spend I think 5 or 10 Skill Points to train in it.  You then need to purchase a skinning knife and keep it in your inventory.  After you kill and loot an animal, you have the ability to skin it, you right click and go through a tradeskill animation.  If you succeeded, a new inventory window pops up with what you were able to skin.  You can also skin other people's kills after they've looted em.</div></div><hr />

It's the usual syndrome.  get a shiney new toy and in the rush to play with it the instructions get ignored! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, truth be told- the instructions for mundane tasks is pretty bleak. I only got to play for like an hour last night and felt like a comnplete idjit asking in General how to do thinks like, pivot the camera so it faces you, loot, and speak in channels. It took me awhile to figure &quot;/1&quot; was ooc/shout. Combat and skills and stuff are detailed nicely, it's the mundane stuff you need to stumble on or just start hammering keys.<br />
<br />
 :kroe <br />
<br />
It's been awhile since playing anything new, EQ chat channels are like engrained in me now. That'll be my biggest learning curve I think. The controls are fairly intuitive for the most part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/join rogue ;)<br />
<br />
Put me on your friends list<br />
<br />
/friend Fala<br />
<br />
I also have a horde character (just for chatting purposes though) /friend Holle  I popped in to see if a rogue channel was going on Horde side and one person was in who was a Safehouse rogue so all is well :)</div></div><hr />
