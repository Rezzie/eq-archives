I really think the virtue/aego line of cleric spells should stack with the POTG line for druids. Pretty much the POTG line is useless in a raid situation or even a group situation due to its lack of AC/hps compared to the cleric line. I personally think these should stack and it would not be too unbalancing. You would get the AC/HPS from the cleric line and the mana regen and slight hps/ac from the druid line. <br />

<br />
I think with the new temp buff box for bard songs, there will be more willingness to use Kazad's Mark + Blessing of the Nine.  Even leaving aside the mana regen, that combination gives more HP. ------------------------------------<br />

A lot of casters will take PoTG (or Nine) plus symbol over aego/virtue for the mana regen.  With Kazad/Nine, I actually have more HP than virtue.  The only drawback is that they don't last as long (Kazad is around 90 minutes). Derrict Thealcoholic -  Nameless Server</div></div><hr />

<br />
Skin like Wood and the Courage line share the same stacking components (HP/AC). This goes all the way up to Aego/Virtue which is a combination of Courage, Holy Armor and Symbol line.<br />
<br />
As for why they dont stack... The ability to add another 470HP and 24AC to a tank in a raid situation where Shaman buff is already adding 544 HP (and some STR/DEX). Add all that HP up...<br />
<br />
470 + 544 + 1500 = 2514 HP in buffs compared to 2044. an extra ~500 hp could mean an extra hit taken by your tank and Verant wants you to lose encounters   Slowmotionz Unstopable<br />
