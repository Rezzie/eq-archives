Especially on Vallon and Tallon, this is effectively abolishing the /con system within an 8 level range. <br />
<br />
Now, that's fine and good for getting rid of bottom feeders who want to attack everything that is both green and in range.  But what about people interested in a fair fight, who think they are starting a just combat but are in fact fighting someone 8 levels below them?  <br />
<br />
IMO, this new system makes a bit more sense for Vallon where at least it's a smaller difference.  However, it seems to me a more sensible system to have instead of the proposed:<br />
<br />
Green - Too low<br />
Black/White - In Range<br />
Red - Too High,<br />
<br />
to have <br />
<br />
Green - Too low<br />
Shades of Blue - Low and in range<br />
Black White - Even or within a level or two or something<br />
Yellows - High but in range<br />
Red - Too high.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the very least, 1 shade of blue and yellow each so that people TRYING to pick black con fights can do so.<br />
<br />
Of course, such a system would once again be of more help to bottom feeders.  But it WOULD solve the problem of showing who is in range with a simple /c, and without effectively destroying /con as a tool on VZ/TZ.</div></div><hr />
