Although I am not yet on the Beta Test, I was wondering if any of you that are would like to share your tips and strategies when participating in PvP?  Do some things work better than others when fighting certain classes?  Do you combine your skills with other classes to demolish your enemies and how so?  Thank you for any information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikus</div><div class="date">10-19-04, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best tip is to know your enemies as much as yourself...<br />
This includes all possible Skills / Talents / Spells...<br />
<br />
So the more you know what kind of possibilities your foe has and learn that the more you can deflect that using a counterpart.<br />
<br />
(but ok, i guess that is logical and well known for anyone)<br />

-Still waiting for Euro Beta here-</div></div><hr />

You have been killed.<br />
You will continue to be killed until a high level comes along and decides to defend the area.<br />
If no high level comes around, you best leave the area or go back to step 2 all over again.<br />
<br />
The way the game is setup, it seems near impossible for the lower levels to fight each other.  In EQ you could have lvl 5 vs lvl 5, that was awesome.  It seems that pvp is restricted to atleast lvl 20, when you are strong enough to make the journey to the contested areas.  So the high levels looking for a battle just find low level chumps to roll over.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bondori</div><div class="date">10-20-04, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule #1 is never go into fight without flash powder and an available vanish.<br />
<br />
Rule #2 is pick your enemies wisely. Avoid mages like the plague, but most other classes are fair game. I was always fond of killing warriors. If you have more than two enemies, sap one of them out (and make sure the one left is one that you can kill under the appropriate time).<br />
<br />
Rule #3 is use your abilities and items wisely. If you're fighting a paladin, get ready to blast his ass with a crystal before he can cast his shield, and it's the same with priests. If you're fighting a warrior, make sure to use evasion before he does his dang-friggin-mother-effing-painful crit ability on you.<br />
<br />
Rule #4 -- and this is for PVE Server -- is choose your area wisely. Don't go picking fights in gadgetzan where there is a couple level 60 alliance mages sitting around. I find it best to go /pvp, and then draw them outside the city. Remember, once you attack somebody and go PVP, anybody can attack you and do the same for themselves. Although most are conservative and would rather not risk it, some people are just plain crazy and love to fight (I was one of them).<br />
<br />
It takes practice, but eventually get it down. When in doubt, VANISH AND RUN!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">12-14-04, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule #5, use the right poison for the right foe.  I like wound poison vs paladins (less bang for their buck), snaring poisons for mages (blink-run-blink-frost makes it hard to chase them down), ect.<br />
<br />
RUle #6, chainstun as much as you can versus casters.  I will pop kidney shot before a eviscerate many times and let my natural dps work them over.  Thistle tea if definatley your friend vs mage and priests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny story on that.  I had just started a human priest,  Just started as in I had just made second level fighting the wolves,  a higher level paladin walks up to me and waits for me to finish a fight, before I even get a chance to loot he challanges me to a dual.  WTF?!<br />
I refused the dual of course,  saw him walk over to another lowebie killing wolves and stand next to him for abit, then a dual flag drops.   I have no idea what he was trying to accomplish there.</div></div><hr />
