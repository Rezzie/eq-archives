<br />
Ok, I finished watching the Escaflowne series a couple days ago. It was pretty damn good I thought! I enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
However, the ending sucked so bad it frustrates the hell out of me. First Hitomi wants to go home, then while she's home she realizes she loves Van. Van takes her back to Gaea. Then, at the end, she goes back home again, saying she'll never forget him....WTF!?<br />
<br />
Why did she go home? Oh yeah, I guess hanging out in Japanese train stations and going to school is better than being with Van in this fantasy world....I don't know, but I couldn't believe after all that she just goes home and never sees him again. (She did say she won't ever forget him, even when she's old.)<br />
<br />
Am I missing something or did that ending just suck between Hitomi and Van?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deuce</div><div class="date">08-08-04, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why not just use the spoiler tag, its not like hard to use two words heh, you probably wrote more about wining about not using it then going ahead and putting it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emrys</div><div class="date">08-08-04, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because it bothers me that people should have to use it when their entire post is a spoiler and they've clearly marked it as such. I don't see the point in my entire post being in the black spoiler area.<br />
<br />
Now if I had a spoiler amongst non-spoiler info, that's one thing. And I whined (sp!) about it because I knew someone would come along and complain. Mission not accomplished there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deuce</div><div class="date">08-08-04, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But what happens when someone posts some nonspoilerish info below?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emrys</div><div class="date">08-08-04, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't matter, the entire post is about the ending of a TV series. <br />
<br />
Thus any info related to the topic should be a spoiler!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes, her going back and being seperated was dumb.</div></div><hr />
