<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cyriex</div><div class="date">05-05-00, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cyriex yawned as he awoke next to his small campfire he built next to a rock in the middle of no where. &quot;Middle of no where, how this suits this place so well&quot; Cyriex sighed to himself. how that suited these newly discovered lands well. Even the name of the area he was in merely described its barren nature. The overthere was nothing more than a flat wasteland, populated by strange monsters, but nothing too amazing. One you got past their strange apperance, nothing stood them far apart from the monsters that ravenge the rest of Norrath. Where were these lands of magic he had heard about that made him come out here.. after all, he had sacrificed much to come here, especially being away for Ardulace, the one he cared for so much. Once again he cursed the weak human blood that caused his pale skin and distrust with those he so wished to be with...the Tier'dal.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Cyriex stood up and gathered his equipment. &quot;humm.. not much food or water left. Not to mind, I shouldn’t be gone for too long&quot; Cyriex thought to himself as he wondered where he would look today. His previous days had found little, so he decided that perhaps following the ancient path that leaves the outpost he almost calls home. Taking a route around the edge off the town, as the religious zealots who run the town do not take kind to any Tier'dal rogue, never mind one who holds pale skin like him, Cyriex found the path and stealthily set down it.<br />
<br />
The countryside was different from any other than he had seen recently, with more hills covered with trees. Strange rocky outcrops and ancient pillars surrounded the land as far as he could see. Surely some huge empire reached out this far, once.<br />
He, like many of the adventurers drawn to these lands, had herd the rumors, of war between great armies of dragons and lizards, of places unlike those of the rest of Norrath, where Dragons and their kind walk freely. He wondered why it seemed all that was proof of this was a pile of ruins as far as the eye could see. It would be a great honor for any traveler to find something of interest, to discover something none had seen. he had found in a book in the Library of Neriak a strange, very old, writing of a place where the dragons of Veeshan lived, where no mortal had discovered, or at least found without not being forever slain. Pah, Cyriex dismissed the idea. It was a myth, and myths are just myths and the world is full of them. Cyriex has heard of the Dragons of Antonica, Nagafen and Vox. They were powerful enough, if a place of dragons existed, this Veeshan's Peak as lore suggested, they're would be no stopping those of Dragon scale...<br />
<br />
While Cyriex was wandering, he almost didn’t notice two towering statues of Lizardmen. Intrigued, he approached the ruins, and found them in good order. The steps leading up to a grand doorway were well used, but it seemed they still where. Up ahead the assassin heard a noise, what seemed to be of a magical origin. Still hidden to all but the best trained eyes, he crept into the hall way, to see a poorly dressed Fier'dal druid. His tattered cloths showed he had been in a hard fight. This surprised Cyriex, even for a Fier'dal this man seemed powerful, what on earth could do this damage to a man? He continued down the path until he could see light.<br />
<br />
As soon as Cyriex's eyes could see the light, a shadow blocked it from him. He could hardly believe his eyes, a drake! He had seen the weak drakes of Lavastom, but could tell even from his distance this was more powerful than anything he had seen before. Ducking away he managed to hide, and promised himself not to stop being stealthy until he left this place. Getting up from the floor, Cyriex looked around this strange place. IT resembled the fiery hell hole of Firestorm somewhat, but as he saw the beasts that roam it, he realized he was in a place where he was far from welcome. Wyverns, Wurms, and other strange monsters crawled around. A shape-changing flying creature flew over where he quietly stood. As he watched it glide on the air crated by the thermal vents, a strange shimmer caught his eye. Peering closer, it resembled an Orb of some kind. Slowly he walked towards it. As he got closer he realized the rock around it was crafted in the shape of a dragon. It could be nothing else, it was huge! The orb was floating, spinning in front of the statue. Curious, Cyriex lent up and touched the Orb.. a magical screech could be heard across the land that the few adventurers around the land screeched in fear. &quot;Pales&quot; Cyriex thought to himself as the orb slowed down to a stop in front of him. He was not sure of the significance of this at all, but before he could ponder it, he heard a growl of a Wurm. It could see him?! This worried Cyriex, not wanting to die in this unforgiving place, he snuck back to the entrance, where a small band of Norraths most powerful adventurers were trying to fight these creatures. Cyriex chuckled as he composed himself and head off to search this area.. Dragons...perhaps they weren’t a Myth...<br />
<br />
As he snuck around, avoiding the Wurms who could see him, Cyriex came to another similar statue and orb. The orb was of what seemed to be lava, yet it did not burn him when again, he touched the orb. Again the magic sent screeches throughout the area, this time causing the &quot;powerful&quot; dragon slayers to flee. Again, the orbed stopped, why, Cyriex had no idea.<br />
<br />
The rock outcrops were particularly strange. One large mountain attracted Cyriex’s attention as it was covered with Wurms. Not one to be scared, he decided to see what was so amazing about this mountain. The Wurms seemed to be guarding it, and were patrolling around its base. Amused that the supposedly smart monsters patrolled in a way similar to the human guards he often got past, he was soon at the bottom of the mountain. Slowly he ascended to the top, which when he reached the summit, he peered over the edge, down to the largest pool of lava one could imagine. Not only that, young Wurms were bathing in it.. this is where they seemed to live! His curiosity satisfied he continued around to a rock that looked as if anything to be a castle....<br />
<br />
Once there, Cyriex was somewhat disappointed to find it rather plain and uninteresting.. even the Wurms left this place alone. Climbing up the rock to get a better view Cyriex checked his surroundings...this truly was a dark place. Far away he could here the screams of warriors more than twice his age being slain by the monsters he so easily avoided.. it was only Wurms he had to fear.. and they were large enough to be seen..<br />
<br />
Then, he heard a unified roar of several Wurms. He span around to see the source, which seemed to be coming from a mountain. If he did not know better, Cyriex would have sworn it was in the shape of a Citadel.. Intrigue he set off towards it<br />
<br />
It was some time when he reached the base, the mountain was larger than anything he had seen in Norrath before. Not intimidated by its size, the assassin set off climbing the strange mountain....the roars came from the other side.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching the top, he was greeted with a long drop down to another pit of lava. Cyriex has time to look down, as a statue of another Dragon was opposite him, its back to him. This statue was huge, and he could not imagine how he had missed it earlier...carefully the explorer edged his way around the edge of the pit brining him to the tail of this huge stone beast. As any mortal would, Cyriex was intimidated by this statues size. In all of his life, which admittedly was a rather moderate 20 seasons, the assassin had never seen anything like this. In all of his training, and his training of others, nothing prepared him for the pure awe-inspiring aura of the statue. Above the dragons head floated a huge lava ball.. Cyriex shuck up the statues tail, up to where the ball floated. Almost inspecting something new to happen, he jumped up and just managed to touch the orb, which came to a screeching halt. It was then Cyriex realized something was below him, as he heard an ear shattering roar that shook the statue so hard, he almost fell off. Thinking that if he had got this far, nothing more worse could appear, the adventurer climbed down from his high perch, and slid down the mountain side to see what made that noise.<br />
<br />
As he looked around the corner at the base of the mountain, he realized he has not slid down a mountain, but a building! The statue was small in comparison this building, half made of stone, half of more magical construction. As he continued to look around the corner, he saw not one, but two Wurms of a size comparable with the statue. If the rogue was to get into the building, getting past those two Guardians would not be simple.<br />
<br />
Cyriex surveyed the entrance, and  climbed up to a ledge at the top of the archway that made up the &quot;door&quot;. Looking down, Cyriex worried that perhaps not even he could make the jump, but with a strange selfless feeling, he jumped from the ledge, and behind the two Wurms. Surprisingly he landed without a sound or injury...Innoruuk must have wished for him to succeed.<br />
<br />
Dusting himself off Cyriex surveyed the hallway he was in. It was easily the height of 3 giants, with a door or huge proportions at the end. Quietly he snuck up to look at the door. It was covered in a mark that he thought he would never see. The symbol of the ring of scale...they existed! Laying his hands on the door, it was almost as if the metal that made them spoke to him.....<br />
<br />
&quot;Danger beyond all imagine lies past these doors. Those who enter must prove their worth and even then they would not be welcome. Past these doors lies the lair of the scale, the Peak of Veeshan&quot;<br />
<br />
VEESHANS PEAK!! Cyriex could not believe it...had he really found the door to a place of pure destruction? As if needing an answer, he heard a new voice enter his head...<br />
<br />
&quot;Blessed be traveler. I am Darmell, patron of adventurers. I have watched from afar as today, you have done what I would have expect armies to struggle with. Although I cannot be sure, I have little doubt you are the first to lay their hands on this door.. and at such a young age.. who ever you work for have a fine rogue. I wish to congratulate you, and wish you luck in getting out alive&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyriex was more confused than anything.. he had found the lair of dragons, and this Patron, obviously a god of some kind, had contacted him, to congratulate him on his discovery. His hands roamed the door, looking for a way of opening it. The assassin found what to him seemed a lock, but it became clear that not even with tools as fine as his, only the required key would open this door.. a key he did not have! Frustrated, Cyriex pondered his situation. Behind him, he had a door that he would not probably spend some time searching for the key for, in front of him, he had two Wurms who would wish to want to stop him leaving. Just then the rogue felt the feeling of hunger. HE had not packed enough food! He knew he could live for some time, so decided with night falling, sleep would be  good idea. Perhaps the Wurms would leave to bath when he awoke. He had to get word of what he had discovered out. After all, if he did not, he would just become a myth, and a myth is a myth, and the world is full of them.<br />
<br />
Cyriex Callidus died that day. When he awoke the next morning he was Cyriex Callidus Wurmshadow, explorer of Kunark.<br />

the problem I had was leaving was, when your stamina is 0 and you use sneak, a dead snail is faster. I managed to, slowly, sneak out through what must have been a 1 degree blindspot the wurms had...I heard of another guy who did the 'falling from the roof trick' after I did it, just to die trying to find that same blindspot on the way out.<br />
Guess I was lucky on the way out..<br />
<br />
but..I wrote the story before I actually left the doors<br />
<br />
8 hours and tons of coffee did'nt stop me falling a sleep<br />
so I'm also the first fool to camp infront of Veeshans Peak too :P<br />

My meager tale is nothing compared to yours, but as a young rogue of five seasons, I did enter the citadel of Lady Vox.  I too remember how my heart did pound as I snuck between the ice giants and past King Thex Ka IV only to have him strike me down as I did approach his Lady.<br />
