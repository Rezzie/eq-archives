<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">06-25-06, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Figured I'd start up a thread for this series, as it is by far my favorite series I've watched (and I've seen my fair share of anime, if I do say so myself :b). Viz Media is finally releasing the first volume DVD on June 27th- anyone else order it? I don't know how good it'll be, though, as it appears to be dubbed- hopefully Viz does a good job with it, in any case. I'm excited ^_^<br />
<br />
And if you don't know what Full Moon is... you're missing out. 'Nuff said  : D</div></div><hr />

But I am half expecting them to totally screw up this release.<br />
<br />
On another note, the manga is absolute win.</div></div><hr />

Ya the manga art is def a lot cuter then the anime at times hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">06-26-06, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched the anime before reading the manga, and both were very impressive. The music in the anime is so strong, it really brings out what can't be simply printed. The manga's story, however, is better imho. The amount of background the characters get is huge.<br />
 <br />
Here's to hoping they don't screw up the dub!:drunks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">06-28-06, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually intend on reading the manga soon (I'll have a lot of time over the summer), but I was wondering- would you recommend I go ahead and read the official, english translated ones released by shojobeat, or find a fansubbed one online?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-28-06, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go ahead and buy the shojobeat ones. The translation is good. And nothing like reading manga in book form. Reading it on the monitor wilmake me blind one day, I am certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">06-28-06, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh cool, thanks- I'll go pick them up, then.<br />
<br />
Also, got my DVD today- the good, it does come with the original Japanese audio track. The bad... the dubbing. Blergh, hearing Mitsuki speak made me wince, and Takuto/Meroko's voices were pretty bad, too. The others didn't seem too bad, although hearing them try to pronounce &quot;Wakaouji&quot; was rather funny :b. So yeah, if you've already watched the anime in Japanese, I wouldn't waste my time on the English version if I were you. Oh well, at least they tried.</div></div><hr />

Then Len will prob not get it then :P. Unless he does it for the Japanese audio but then...well...you know :P.<br />
<br />
And wth is with anime companies destroying voice acting lately =/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">06-28-06, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Long as they didn't screw with the Japanese audio any, and the subtitles aren't too bad, I'd be tempted to pick up a thinpack of the series when it completes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">07-07-06, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up the ShojoBeat mangas, just finished the third volume. Wow, the anime's story is quite different... but I think I like the manga a lot more (we'll see once I fully catch up, I'm *trying* to pace myself so I can make it last longer :b). The differences in the manga blew my mind all over again- it reminded me just why I loved this series so much ^_^<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the DVDs- the subtitles are decent enough- definately not a.f.k. quality, but still not too bad at all. I'm gonna end up buying all the DVDs regardless of how bad the English dubs are, simply because I wanna support this series as much as I can (hopefully it'll see bigger recognition in the US ^_^)</div></div><hr />
