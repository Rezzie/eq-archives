<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-05-04, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since there is a large amount of interest in Anime it seems, and many are interested in faster methods of getting Anime. I thought of doing something somewhat old-school. Back in the day (for those who don't know this and are new to Anime) people would mail each other VHS fansubbed tapes of anime since it was too hard to do it over the internet.<br />
<br />
But now with the existence of 4.7gb dvd's, how about we set something up, I don't know how, to mail each other DVD's. It can be done in a give and take sort of thing, for example:<br />
<br />
I have the full season of Onegai Twins and Scrapped Princess.<br />
<br />
Notwen has the full season of Naruto.<br />
<br />
Both fit on one dvd, so we mail them to each other. And if the person doesn't have a DVD writer, they can pay cost. 1.00 for the DVD, 50 cents for the case, and mail cost.<br />
<br />
It's cheap and effecient way of transfering large amounts of data. I would be happy to do this if I was told the best way  of mailing DVD's. It takes me only 20 minutes to do it. We could pay by paypal or mail a check or something.<br />
<br />
How much would an envlope and postage cost? I've never actually mailed something other than a letter so I don't know how it works. I think it's a good idea and something we should somehow keep within the safehouse. Personally I wouldn't waste time making a DVD for someone I don't recognize as a safehouse member but I'd gladly make them for those I do know.<br />

I only have naruto downloaded unfortunately.  The rest of my anime is licensed and bought.  I'd buy those one you have though.  And I'm hoping to pick up a DVD writer here soon, (I need to make a hard backup of my documents directory and it's ringing in at around 5GB).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with with streamload is that the people who do this are the people who DONT want to download.<br />
<br />
Gyorg the cost is:<br />
<br />
1) 1.00 per DVD<br />
2) (?) Mailing Cost<br />
3) (?) Protective case (optional... but I would think it'd be a good idea to protect them somehow during shipment.)<br />
<br />
4.5 GB each DVD. Average episode is 175 MB, but it varies greatly. When you figure out about how much you would pay, send the money and I get the stuff + burn them and mail them. This step is why I am recommending doing this to only trustworthy people, but it is cheap enough that even if someone ripped you off, you wouldn't lose much + person wouldn't gain much so not worth the effort. <br />
<br />
Or, the person could give you his address, and you order the stuff via newegg, and instead of mailing to yourself, mail to the person, and send shipping cost somehow. Many ways to do this. Just throwing ideas out there. Edited by: Stalkyr Weaksoul at: 2/5/04 6:30 pm</div></div><hr />

Umm... yeah, there are already ten million and one ways to download fansubs over the internet, all of which have been discussed ad nauseum in this forum, and others at the Safehouse.  For some people that just doesn't work out, for one reason or another.  Witness Gyorg's 200+hour One Piece downloads. :P  This is an old-school style alternative.</div></div><hr />

www.animeondvd.com/licenselist/ and animesuki.com/doc.php/licensed/list.html<br />

(I get my anime from animesuki, since they are really good about pulling anime once its been licensed)  course hard drive space is quite limited here so once I watch something it usually gets cleared out</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one thing that came out regarding Scrapped Princess is that Anime Nation, in discussing the types of shows they were pursuing, said they had tried to get Scrapped Princess, but it was taken.<br />
<br />
We've seen all too many times recently (Hikaru no Go ESPECIALLY) where licensing of the anime was taken as fact based on unofficial statements like that, which later turned out to be false.  No one is going to recognize a show as being licensed without the company that has it coming out and saying &quot;We have Scrapped Princess&quot;, for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just let me know how you want to do it.<br />
<br />
As far as what I have..  I tend to just buy it all.  Keeps the companies doing it in business I figured.  Longer they are in business the more that can come to my house.    Tenchi Muyo GXP is one I keep looking for the rest of but I found out awhile back that they are actually producing it now so Ive got the first two on order. (Have the first 4 episodes and thats it.   )<br />
Not slamming anyone for D/L the stuff.  Its just that I can afford it so I buy it instead, not everyone can afford to spend around 12k a year on anime.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">02-06-04, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there anything else that's left unlicensed that you don't already have Stalk? I mean, that's a pretty big list there, and the more you have, the less other people could contribute. If things worked kinda like a network of sharing, this could be a pretty cool thing. i.e., you send One Piece to person A who doesn't have really any anime collection so far due to slow internet, but they have a burner and that's good enough! Person A then makes copies and sends to persons B, C, and D, who requested the series on, let's just say a seperate thread or board or something, and you passed them along to Person A, who offered to take over a bit of the load for the one series he now has. He receives other series' from Persons B, C, and D, and the network of anime continues to grow!<br />
<br />
*cough* Of course, that could very well just be the delusions of someone who's had 4 hours of sleep in the last 32 hours... woo!<br />
<br />
EDIT -- Of course, if you wanted to have an already established network of such a thing immediately available, you could replace the word &quot;Anime&quot; with the word &quot;Porn,&quot; and I'm sure that the whole idea would be a big hit around here   Edited by: Teannin Bramblefeet at: 2/6/04 7:35 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Btw to the rest of the people...<br />
If you liked the Kenshin anime, you probably would love Peace Maker Kurogane, its set in the same time period as Kenshin as well as has many of the same characters, just from a different viewpoint, the Shinsengumi side basically, and the author has tried to be pretty historically accurate, which means Okita is going to DIE... nooo.</div></div><hr />

Nearly everything I used to own fansubbed on vhs (400 tapes or so) is out on dvd now, and there's at least 20 new discs coming out every month.  I don't even want to guess how much anime I normally watch but I'll guarantee you it exceeds any sort of sanity test out there.  I can barely keep up with just the domestic releases and the few region 2 discs I buy.  Do you people still watching fansubs just not watch the vast plethora of commercial releases or what?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-07-04, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't buy R2 dvd's, but I only buy R1 dvd's of anime I've already seen and truly enjoyed, and are not butchered. So I'm not buying anime I haven't seen. I consider fansubs something like watching it on TV before buying. It's not fair, in my opinion, to be forced to buy without knowing whether you'll like it or not. It's like buying The X Files without having the opportunity to watch it on TV to see if you enjoy it enough.<br />
<br />
That's why I have lots of time for fansubs. I watch about 20-30 hours of anime each week.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">02-08-04, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One problem some people have with BitTorrent is being firewalled, and the incoming ports are blocked or something like that (I forget exactly...). If you're behind a router, I suggest going into the settings for it and opening up the ports that BitTorrent uses, as this fixes quite a few download to upload ratio problems. Also, since you're using DSL, you might want to drop your max upload speed to around 13 to 15 or so, as often with DSL, if you're maxing out your available upload bandwidth, your download bandwidth takes a crap.<br />
<br />
And if you want to find anime... or really anything on IRC, I suggest searching for what you want using www.ircspy.com</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a bit of a loaded question.  Do I not watch the vast plethora of commercial releases?  No, I don't.  Do I buy commercial releases?  Of course.  <br />
<br />
For fansubs, there are generally about 6 or 7  shows I try to keep up with at a time.  At the moment I'm down to 4 or 5.  That ONLY makes about 2 to 2.5 hours worth of material per week (less right now).<br />
<br />
For DVDs, I usually end up buying about 80 dvds in the course of the year.  And most of those are shows I watched and enjoyed on fansub (be that new digisubs or 4th gen VHS from back in college).  Maybe I'll watch one or two a day.  Or maybe I'll marathon 4 or 5 on a rainy Saturday.<br />
<br />
That's not so much time really.  Maybe there is just more that appeals to you than does me.  Something like 450 anime dvds came out last year, after all, but as much as I love anime, it's like everything else - most of it I can do without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">02-09-04, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote:Something like 450 anime dvds came out last year,<br />
<br />
   ... Looks at how his collection has grown about 250+ videos over the last year.<br />
<br />
I can understand where your sitting stalkyer.  If you want I could send by anime database to ya with all the ones I have. (Yes Im such a geek that I wrote a libary program to track all my anime.  The thing even keeps descriptions and box cover graphics.) Not sure how that would help you though because they are all commercial stuff.  <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
On a side note...  My shower curtain has been looking kind of raggid and I was going to replace it.  I has a strange thought of replacing it with an Anime one.  But I didnt see anything on a casual google.  Anybody know of one off the top?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_nekoken</div><div class="date">02-09-04, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess my attitude is that most of the really good modern stuff will eventually come out on dvd domestically so I'm willing to wait for it.  And nobody bothers finishing off old series (like Legend of the Galactic Heroes) so there just isn't any impetus for me to deal with the hassle of fansubs.  I don't trust any of the peer to peer networks and am too lazy to read through the source code of the open source clients to verify they won't be doing anything I don't want them to.  I also only have a 256kb pipe now that I live out in the sticks again.<br />
<br />
I think I'm averaging about 150 new discs a year at the moment but I'm hoping that will slow down a bit now that I've replaced almost all of my tapes and a number of series are completed such as City Hunter or Ranma 1/2.  Once the Marmalade Boy box comes out my fansub collection will be down to Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Kodomo no Omocha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-09-04, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I mostly do fansubs because of what WONT come out here. For example, a World Masterpeice Theater anime just started airing, 3000 leagues in search of Mother, which was aired in 1979, is being subbed right now. This anime won't come to america, most likely ever.<br />
<br />
There are many others that won't come. That I can watch stuff that will come before buying it here is just a bonus.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-11-04, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not want to make a new post, so without further ado, I would like to finally announce the implementation of this concept.<br />
<br />
Please bear in mind that the first month will be hard, as I get used to doing this, knowing what to buy, etc. And it would behoove you to go to the forum and reading the Welcome post there.<br />
<br />
I got Aidden's permission for this site, because there is no way to do this without cluttering up Logged Out and generally annoying the Safehousers.<br />
<br />
It is nothing fancy, no pictures, just text, links, and a forum. If someone wants to design a layout, by all means, knock yourself out. I'm pretty sure that since the entire site is less than 200kb total, I won't have bandwidth issues.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, homestead is crap. I know this, you know this, I'm too damned lazy to find a better place, so if you want to recommend something that is as easy to register as Homestead, and about the same cost, then please do recommend.<br />
<br />
In order to aviod problems, I will be the only person distributing/trading. After I feel confident and everything is running smoothly, I will allow others to trade with each other on the forum.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that this is a nonprofit thing. Anyone who tries to make a profit will be banned permanently. Knowingly attempting to trade licensed items will result in a warning or ban. Anime Fansub Distribution is now availble.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">03-12-04, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Btw, I downloaded Naruto 1-70 and it is just awsome.  Thanks to everyone that talked about it.<br />
<br />
*hugs DVD burner*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">03-12-04, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I took a look and picked some out but I need to setup a paypal acct.  <br />
<br />
Also looked at your &quot;All Anime I Have&quot; list.  If you want I have an Anime Catalog program that I wrote so that I could keep track of all mine.  In it I also wrote a &quot;HTML Catalog Generator&quot; that will put all the titles into an HTML format that can be uploaded to the website.<br />
<br />
What makes it different is that for each title you can also enter a description and box art graphic in additon to specifics such as categories, ratings, producer, language, duration, suggested age...... Basiclly a lot of things you may want to know about it.<br />
When you click on a specific title then it displays the details along with the graphic.<br />
<br />
I did it for my own use because I thought it would be a fun thing to have.  If you want a copy I can send it to you, all youd have to do is all the data entry.  (Which could be the worst part in some cases)<br />
<br />
About the only requirement is that youll probably have to have Microsoft Access installed on the machine, or at least the database drivers.  Ive never run the app on a machine without access so I couldn't say for sure.  I wrote it so long ago and didnt figure anyone would be using it other than me so I didnt write anything special for the database accessability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-12-04, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds great, Urusai. I was having the hardest time organizing everything. The stuff on the list of Anime I have is probably only 50% or less of what I actually have. It's just way too cluttered for me to sort through.<br />
<br />
Paypal wasn't too hard to set up, only took me 5 days to get confirmed and ready.</div></div><hr />
