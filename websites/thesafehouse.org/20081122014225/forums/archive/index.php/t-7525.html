<br />
anyways, could any of you RZ players tell me a bit about the server politics.  like which zones are safe to travel through, and which PK guilds to watch out for at low levels.  maby a decent guild or something.  ill probobly play this on weekdays where i dont have much time(hour or 3) to play due to work. <br />

I'll just sum up a few things, if you have any other questions ask me in game.<br />
1)Steamfont is one of the worst newbie zones as far as pks.  I leveled a gnome rogue and a gnome necro there, so i know.  50% of the people you meet there will be pks.  99% of the magicians you meet there will try to pk you.  99% of the naked warriors will try to pk you.  I advise you to solo in a far off corner, or at odd hours of the day until you work up to about level 8.  At around that level you can go to butcherblock, where you can basicly level without being bothered.<br />
2)Pk heavy zones<br />
-levels 1-10<br />
--any newbie zone/newbie dungeon<br />
-levels 10-20<br />
--areas just outside of newbie zones(commons)<br />
-levels 30+<br />
--oasis, sro, the dreadlands.<br />
3)PK guilds<br />
-low levels<br />
--flowers of happiness<br />
--shortenbane<br />
--reign of pain<br />
--malificus sect(they rock.. really nice people... but they do pk with heavy roleplaying restrictions)<br />
-higher levels<br />
--darkenbane<br />
--house in'visus<br />
--reign of pain<br />
--malificus sect<br />
4)Respected/good guilds you could join<br />
-silent decree(canbik's guild)<br />
-warriors of wit(my guild)<br />
-true alliance<br />
5)Warnings<br />
-don't join some large guild where you don't know anyone.  Guilds like this generally have one or two pks that ruin the reputation for all of you<br />
-gnome casters are evil, avoid them at all costs =)<br />
<br />
<br />
The server is a blast.  It manages to basicly preserve the PvE part of the game, and leave PvP as a passtime or a solution to a problem.  <br />
Don't be discouraged by the newbie zones!<br />
It gets so much better!<br />
<br />
If you need a small wad of cash to get you going, i'd be glad to help you out. 											Cylant Butdeadly<br />

ok that said a nec was a good choice for a first rallos chara as your pet will help you avoid getting pked to much.  Avoid pk guilds until you feel you are quallified to go forth and GANK! as your tag will get you killed for this simple act of wearing it.<br />
 a fairly new guild I might be able to get you into is call the Gladiators of no remorse, a feeder guild for the knights onR. I have found them to be a bunch of FREAKS who are cool to hang with and generally know their @#%$. they are antipk's (dont worry think james bond here, basically police with orders to use Extreme predjudice)(or is it force? bah whatever we kill ALOT of cheesy pks so dont worry about gettin your shots in and dont cry if you lose gear,  thank em if you learned anything from the fight, congratulate them if they beat your ass when you were certain you would win, and if you kill someone on a corpse run dont let me hear about it. I have/can get a chara in your range and spank you twice for that rude crap.<br />
ok babbling now...must sleep soon.<br />
