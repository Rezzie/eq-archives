   So far I've not noticed anyone say anything before a P v P attack or during combat.  I would've expected people to have some things hotkeyed like &quot;In the name of (deity) I will cleanse this land of %R blood!&quot;<br />
   Anyone have anything, or know of some good ones?  The naked attack without any sort of statement or the plain old &quot;Hail&quot; before an attack is just sooo uncreative.<br />
<br />
   I have a &quot;Time to die %T&quot; emote which is usually for pulling, as well as a &quot;Back off, I got no quarrel with the %R race, this is between %T and me,&quot; and a &quot;Don't make me kill you, %T&quot; emote.</div></div><hr />
