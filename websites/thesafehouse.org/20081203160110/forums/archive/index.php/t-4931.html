I have Frozen Heart Piercer, it has extra cold damage that procs at 46 or 48. Does the effect matter? As soon as you get the item does it show the effect, because I was thinking FHP had a effect.

<br />
<br />
If not disregard my following statement, <br />
<br />
You will get your proc on the weapon as soon as it goes yellow, it's completely random in everything I've seen.  I could be wrong.. only been using the forsaken rapier yellow for 4 levels.. maybe not enough to test it. Balor Gafdan Nightshade of Guinivere<br />

It is vaulted right now so I cant get the exact specs, but it is a 15+dps thruster (dont remember speed) which is +2 pierce, +9 dex, and hits with an 88 dmg cold DD... I luv my guildies.
