<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LeenanLocks</div><div class="date">07-30-03, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">he's 72 hours<br />
a failed war means you must talk with the dain over again and get the note.<br />
you can try as many times as it takes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zyuu</div><div class="date">07-31-03, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know it wasn't 72, because originally I had though it was 3 days.. i checked if he was up a few hours before the 3 day mark 2 different times and he was up..  I also checked after 2 days the 2nd time and he wasnt up yet<br />
<br />
this was a while ago though, maybe it's changed</div></div><hr />
