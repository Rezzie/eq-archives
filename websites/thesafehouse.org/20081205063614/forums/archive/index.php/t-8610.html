(ie- increasing the faction per kill)<br />
<br />
Any information at all would be helpful...haven't been able to find much.<br />

Is it finally possible to build good factionwith the goblins?  I am thinking that there should be Droga quests to balance those in Chardok.  I have killed Sarnaks by the thousand and really should be a goblin ally by now.  All those Sarnak kills have still left me kOS to goblins... I am just hoping that this will change under the revamp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Flacked</div><div class="date">06-26-03, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a larg camp of goblins in FM that contain many of the old favorates from the original Droga.  These mobs still give faction and still drop skins and salts.  They are just as easy to kill as before and there are enough of them to keep at least one person busy before they re-pop.<br />
<br />
And yes, the drops in the new Droga are pretty darn nice.  I have yet to meet a named there, including King Droga, that I could not easily solo as a 65 Necro.  Tiny agro raidus, none summon, none see invis, most are dark blue at 65, many named and they seem to pop from their PHs about 1 in 5 times.  All in all a very nice upgrade to the zone.  Highest mob level I have seen is 61.</div></div><hr />

Be happy you will be able to get exp or AA now while you work on Chardok faction, as well as loot.<br />
<br />
Killing around 4K green as grass goblins solo is not fun. I wish I coulda got exp doin' it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Crii</div><div class="date">06-27-03, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the angry goblin still stashed away deep in Droga after the revamp? If so, it could make that part of the quest a lot harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">06-27-03, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killing 4k greens really isn't much of a downer for me.  A little boring, but eh, what you expect.<br />
<br />
However, what made droga/nurg so much of a pain is how much garentee'd dmg you took from these pansy greens, due to HTs and a few other really hard to resist spells/roamers backstab.<br />
<br />
With the HTs and occasional backstab, these mobs have crazy dmg frontloading.<br />
<br />
It takes me 15sec to kill gobo A.  In that time, he does 50dmg melee, if that, but 99.9% of the time gets off a 200+ dmg HT.<br />
<br />
Unlike other silly green camps, unless you're a petclass or have hefty lifetaps/regen spells/heals, you will have downtime similar to if you were soloing a much higher green/lblue dungeon.<br />
<br />
And that really killed your KPH (kills per hour), which made it seem far more boring and sucky than it should have been.<br />
<br />
And those once in a while times when you get a great double backstab, the mob turns to you, HTs you, and then dies from your first round of attacks? Man, gota love that 200ish DPS from a lvl 30s mob.... :P Edited by: Vagabond at: 6/27/03 12:46 pm</div></div><hr />

Just one thing.  Make sure you get finishing blow level 1, and a Mrylokar BP if your a rogue.  Thats how I got through it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lias</div><div class="date">06-29-03, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ddarr, I stated the reason for wanting Goblin faction in my original post...  quests.<br />
<br />
It's all about balance.  Chardok vs Droga.  The same balance that we see in Katta vs Sanctus Seru or ToV vs Kael.<br />

<br />
I do think it would be nice if there was a goblin series of quests for those people who want to continue to stomp on Sarnaks.<br />
<br />
As it is, eventually everyone (well, almost) gets good Chardok faction. Kinda boring to have no alternative route.</div></div><hr />
