<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to be bugged. Garroting the mutated drudges doesn't give credit for the kills in the quest log (although they do die), and nothing I tried on the patrollers (2nd floor guys) did the job. Am I really going to have to go back with a wrecking crew and tear that tower apart, or is there a way to successfully sneakify that quest at 20?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargesh</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds strange.<br />
I did the tower mobs with 3 rogues. 2x21 and a 20 and it all worked fine.  So I can confirm it's not a level issue for you.  One thing that we did though was use Ambush all of the mobs.  It seems that they are all susceptible to Ambush.  Boss mob dropped with 3 Ambush.  Those instances where we didn't get the 3rd off, one of us wound up dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I understand it, one of our special abilities is supposed to oneshot the mobs on each level of the tower. On the first floor, garrote kills them in one hit (although we don't get credit for the kill in the quest log- /bugged it). That leads me to believe that there's some trick to the 2nd floor guys I'm not seeing. I tried all the openers to no effect, they must be weak to sin strike or gouge or something. I'll go back when I have distract/vanish and see what I can dig up on 'em.<br />
<br />
So nobody has done it solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Colvin</div><div class="date">12-08-04, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done it solo, I did everything but the the boss at about 22 I think, then did boss at 25.   Only special thing I did was on each level wait til they were far enough apart to get solo.  On 2nd floor, I pulled one back down to 1st so I could solo it, then went back and got other.  Each floor its able to get one solo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">12-09-04, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The boss should be soloable at 22 (dagger spec, imp gouge/backstab &amp;amp; malice5), if:<br />
<br />
1) you land both ambushes (ambush, vanish, ambush)<br />
2) you pop a greater healing potion (the 400ish one) at some point during the fight<br />
3) you burn evasion early<br />
4) you have something in the way of buffs (armor potion, mark of the wild), or much better gear than I have<br />
<br />
I got him SO CLOSE (down to one or two hits) twice and gave up. I'll try to solo him again tomorrow, before I call in the wrecking crew, and see if maybe using expose armor instead of evisc on the first 5cp move helps (at 22 a decent backstab is almost as good as a 5pt evisc, and a crit BS is almost double it). Also I'll bring better potions than the lesser healing I had on me at the time ;)<br />
<br />
Oh and FYI, the patrollers don't seem to be weak to anything (haven't gotten rupture yet  :oops  ), but the lookouts do some funky morph-into-a-slime thing when you stick 'em with an evisc, even a 1cp.  So far the hardest part (besides Gillywix the Humongous Bastard) has been getting the 2 mutated drudges on the bottom floor solo, since you don't get credit for killing them if you use their weakness to garrote you've got to duke it out with a 24-25 mob. It's not the hardest thing in the world (I didn't even use potions on them, just gougedanced them one at a time) but it took me a few aborted pulls to get them to play fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Victory! Ambush/vanish/ambush, sin strike gouge thistle tea backstab, expose armor , evasion, greater healing potion, gougedance for 5cp eviscs. No buffs, no clickies but the single potion. It took 2 tries once I got the proper healing and decided to try expose armor (missed 2nd ambush on my first attempt, got dumb and he spotted me after vanish), but woohoo- solo'd a 26 elite at 22 (although after two ambushes he was at like 2/5 health).<br />
<br />
Possible but not probable indeed!</div></div><hr />

<br />
when I did it, i just snuck up the whole way, then distracted him and jimmied the chest, then jumped off.<br />
<br />
then about 5 minutes later I realised I had to kill all the guys too (don't ask, i was tired), so i got a war friend of mine to duo him with me. i forget what level i was.</div></div><hr />
