Reporting new mobs drops as being possible new poison ingredients is fine though.  Better to have this information just in case it is of use in my opinion.<br />

<br />
Quote <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you been looking at your alternate experience skills and wondering why they were 'lackluster'? Well, it's because rogues have a terrific new poison system!<br />
<br />
Poisons were completely revamped in PoP!! Although the older poisons did not change, the new poisons are more of a potion than a poison. Right clicking on a poison has a 6 second apply time, and will equip any attack with a 10-15 minute proc effect. Since these are more like potions than poisons, there is no more check for the Apply Poison skill! You will never fail to put on your poison again.<br />
<br />
The initial planar poisons will be the smaller 10 minute, lower effectiveness types, but completing a certain roguely quest will let you make the much more potent 15 minute types.<br />
<br />
Stackable poisons are also available in both 5 and 10 charge uses! Very similar to the shaman's alchemy bag where they put in 5 or 10 potions to make charges, the developers used this idea in the poison trade! Just like the shaman’s bag, you won't be able to buy this bag just at any vendor. I'm sure someone in the Plane of Knowledge has some clues on it though.<br />
<br />
The recipes are being added to the game the day the expansion goes live. This means that I have no more of a clue on how to make the poisons as you do. There will be multiple ways to create the same poisons, and all of them will require you to kill blue or higher mobs to make them! No more hunting those boring green zones for ingredients!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heard this was a fake post though so ... a well here ya go   better then all the data i found so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tried haling the 3 merchants selling poison supplies.. with or without Vial (gm) equipped   Vial and Faction book and faction book and no vial. No change at all in their answer. <br />
<br />
Tomorrow I'll start hailing all the people in the library ... as per eqtraders most recipes so far where found this way handed over by a hailed npc while having the correct skill lvl required. <br />
<br />
Word of advice ... you must complete the Faction book quest... most npc's don't really tell you anything till you are walking around with this faction book. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pelagia</div><div class="date">10-24-02, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The PoK Faction book (Gained by doing Willamina's Needle quest) appears to begin a series of quests much like the Velious Ring and Shawl ones. Hail the Faction Leader in the main buildings in each section of PoK to see the next stage of the quest (Like the velious Shawl quests they are based on using advanced tradeskills). Apparently you can choose the planar abilities you want. Evil gains you some type of Planar combat ability, Good gains you Planar Stealth ability and Neutral gives you some type of Planar Magic Ability. At this point I don't see what the Faction Book has to do with our three contrary rogue merchants.<br />
<br />
Likewise, Im not sure what the GMAV has to do with the merchants (but after reading this thread I tried various chit-chat brandishing my GMAV too --- in vain    )<br />
<br />
ATM, I am of the opinion that the Sketch Book will contain 2-4 lost pages wherein our recipes are contained. <br />
<br />
A seperate issue is the creation of our Advanced Poison Vials, if indeed the Advanced Vial Sketch is for poison making. I have been working on this problem with my friend a GM potter but we havent had any failures or successful combines yet using pre-PoP supplies. Our best guess is that there is an additional POP ingrediant still unknown which we have yet to try.<br />
<br />
The Recipe for a Poison Vial is simple:<br />
Small Block of Clay<br />
Sealed | Lined | Poison Vial Sketch<br />
Water Flask<br />
HQ | MQ Pelt<br />
<br />
creates in a Pottery Wheel an Unfired Vial which combines with a HQ Sheet in a Kiln to create the Vial.<br />
<br />
The Recipe for an Advanced Vial probably works similarly:<br />
Small Block of Clay or Block of Tanaan Clay<br />
Advanced Vial Sketch<br />
Water Flask<br />
HQ | MQ Pelt<br />
<br />
but with the addition of some unknown PoP ingrediant. Right now we are tracking down some Tainted Planar Essence to try some different combinations, possibly with celestial solvent as well.<br />
<br />
BTW Tha O'Danos Shaman lead was a false one. I checked on that this evening.<br />
