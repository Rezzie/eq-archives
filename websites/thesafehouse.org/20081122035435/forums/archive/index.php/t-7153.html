<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elerion</div><div class="date">02-12-03, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two years ago, before I quit EQ, my main was an enchanter. Back then, it was &quot;common knowledge&quot; that charisma was the single most important stat for enchanters. Every decent enchanter I knew had 200 cha well before they had 200 int. After all, charisma helped tremendously to avoid Mez Resists and Charm resists, as well as making your charm last longer. Seeing as getting two mez resists in a row often meant a group wipe or at least the death of either chanter or cleric, cha was considered more important than int.<br />
<br />
Now, fast forward a couple of years, account is reactivated, and I am about to start playing my enchanter again. However, when chatting in the serverwide necro channel with my necro, everyone seems to know that charisma does not affect mezzes and charms. <br />
<br />
Huh? Was it all just another EQ urban legend, just like agi and dex being the most important rogue stats, and low cha giving better fears? Or are the necros there just clueless? Or perhaps the charisma bonus only applies to enchanters when mezzing/charming, not necros?<br />
<br />
Basically: Does charisma affect mez and charm, and is it still considered the most important enchanter stat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Quiet</div><div class="date">02-12-03, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I have read from the developers:<br />
<br />
Charisma has an effect on the duration of charms. (Have heard a minor effect, to a moderate effect). Levels and magic resist have a much stronger impact.<br />
<br />
Charisma has an impact for all charm classes, however the &quot;expected&quot; charisma requirement for enchanters has been stated to be higher than the &quot;expected&quot; charisma requirement for druids. (For example)<br />
<br />
Charisma has an effect on the agro of the Lull line of spells (which are now moderately useful).<br />
<br />
I have heard no mention from the developers on Mez and charisma.<br />
<br />
What I have seen and read about charisma:<br />
<br />
Mez appears to me to have an impact based upon charisma, but again magic resists and levels play a bigger impact. (Mind you my observations are usually made comparing after death and before death.)<br />
<br />
Others have carefully stuided the mez vrs charisma and have found that unless the charisma is greatly different, there is little to no impact based upon charisma.<br />

<br />
We really don't know.  The above post is as accurate as anything else I've seen.<br />
<br />
I haven't noticed much of a difference on my chanter with cha but I've barely played him either, so I can't speak for high end encounters.</div></div><hr />

Charms/Lulls are it's only use, and even then, does not make that big of a difference unless you have it en masse. This is from personal experience, and what Verant has said. Lvl and the mobs innate MR have the most to do with durations and resists. Far more then Cha does.<br />

Level and MR are still what makes up the first and most significant save.<br />

I've never bought any gear for my alt enchanter based on it's CHA bonus, but if INT gear happens to have some CHA on it too, it's just gravy. -- Lemac Dushae<br />

I experimented and went as high as 240 cha but the improvement wasn't as big as expected so I swapped around stuff until she got 255 int 214 cha with kei. Now I am going for hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Platinu</div><div class="date">03-19-03, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I charm killed in Tactics for 5 hours last night with a charisma of 95 (lowest I could get it =) and I had zero resists on charm.  Day before that, with a 185 charisma, in 4 hours I had zero resists on charm.  Duration seemed about the same, and I wasn't soloing (I hate soloing and only do it if I'm close to finishing an AA and can't get a group)<br />
<br />
I know that's not exact, but those experiences and many like them prove, in my mind, that I don't give a damn if charisma adds 1 millionth of a percent to my chance to charm or not.  It's worthless, again in my opinion, and I often don't even bother to charisma buff myself.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing an enchanter since EQ came out.  I picked her simply for the versatility of her spells, and because in the early days other players weren't clear on her role, she died alot.  I retired her, and lvled a cleric and druid to the 60's.<br />
<br />
Now that enchanters are revered, and needed for most encounters, I went back to her.  <br />
<br />
An EQ developer (I heard he was canned for this) named Lawrence Poe, said he only coded CHA to work for charms, and later lulls.  (This is the coding guy, i'd take his word over anyone elses, hehe)<br />
<br />
From my own experience, resists with mezzes only occur with things either highly MR or naturally MR.  Once I tash, it's all downhill from there.  I have an unbuffed CHA of 145, and i never buff it and I do fine.  I do notice however, that gear that had earlier been CHA that I switched out for Hp gear made the difference time and time again.  I love hps  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps...this has been such a big debate throughout EQ's existance it's still kinda funny to see it on boards hehe<br />

Also, testing on the Concert Hall has shown high CHA to reduce the rate of missing notes.  It may or may not reduce fizzles for other casters. Veteran Keiz Dinzyar<br />

I just got a my 100 cha robe (since I needed a robe), and ended up with an unbuffed cha of 227, and int in the 250 range. I started using hp/mana gear, with KEI and cha buff am well over 255 for each. <br />
<br />
It may not help anything, but at least I never have to worry about the possiability that it could. Besides I haven't seen anyone else with my robe (besides the other guildies that have it). <br />

<br />
Anyway, I am 65 with TD 1  and I charm kill a TON.  I notice a difference with 270 charisma compared to to 220 (my unbuffed charisma).  Maybe its the placebo effect but I won't charm kill without the buff.   I was with another 65 chanter the other day and we were side by side for SEVERAL hours.  He had same level of TD and I noticed that he broke more often than me Quite often.   Maybe TD 1 doesn't take effect till you zone or something because he bought that aa after he saw how much longer my charm was lasting constantly.  After he was done he asked me what my charisma was and then replied with &quot;oh, that must have been it.&quot;  Oh well, take it as you will, it doesn't hurt for sure.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
If I tell you then I will have to kill you in roguely fashion. <br />
<br />
100 cha robe<br />
<br />
Some FYI's, he has around 400-600k hps, not kidding. He is really easy to kill, on the pull he charms a few people, just have everyone junk buff/stay out of range till the chanters drain his mana. He should get drained through the entire fight, all 45 min of it (depending on your dps, the last time it went fast and only took 20 min). Oh he also AOE dispells, till drained also. He is slowable, just have slower redo it often, if he breaks slow, you will have deaths. double to quading in the 250's <br />
<br />
Best of luck <br />

However, faction also plays in here too.  An example of this is when I was in BoT lulling mobs with my druid.  I got the whole room done and failed on the last one and he immediately attacked me.  (What do you expect with a druid of 95 CHA and a mob that scowls? :P hehe)<br />
<br />
For enchanters tho, I very rarely rely on it, as I don't charm too often hehe.</div></div><hr />

Fear lasted as long as with 3 CHA vs 86 CHA.  as posted above.  It does not make any difference that I can see.  MR May be the only factor, less they are immune</div></div><hr />
