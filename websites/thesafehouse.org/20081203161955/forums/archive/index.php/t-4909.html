<br />
I am a very new to the game Shadowblade and was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on how they set up their styles, etc. to maximize efficiency.  <br />
<br />
I am currently level 9.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eiger DAOC</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 9th, you might be able to fit all your combat styles on one page, but soon you won't...<br />
<br />
I opted for one bank of keys for each type of opening I use, Backstab and Throwing Daggers.<br />
<br />
The Backstab bank is set up approximately as follows:<br />
<br />
Sprint<br />
Stealth<br />
2-Handed Sword Hotkey<br />
Backstab<br />
ThighCut (BS Chain followup)<br />
1-Hand Sword<br />
Left Axe<br />
Assault (Open Sword Style)<br />
<br />
So I basically start at the top for my opening... I hit stealth, get in position, make sure I have my 2hander wielded, backstab, Thighcut, switch to 2 handers, which drops you out of combat, and use Assault to get an initial style in and restart combat.<br />
<br />
My Throwing daggers Hotkey bank is similar:<br />
<br />
Sprint<br />
Stealth<br />
Throwing Daggers (hit 3 times to wield, throw, and release)<br />
<br />
1 Hander sword<br />
Left Axe<br />
<br />
Open Style<br />
<br />
Some free spots on this bank, still.<br />
<br />
After my opener, whicher I happen to use, I go to my &quot;During the Fight&quot; bank.  This has all the styles that I might like to use, including side styles, taunt and anti-taunt styles, and reaction (evade) styles.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

That way when I get in position on my prey I /stick until situation feels right and then initiate BS combo.  If it is a tough yellow or there has been a miss or fumble on my part I shift to melee Hot Key bar and Dual Wield.  Main point is to make Hot Key bars for your favorite styles and then when things get sticky you can execute without fumbling around and mashing the wrong buttons.  I did a sit one time by doing that and not only did I feel stupid but I ate dirt from a green, lol.</div></div><hr />
