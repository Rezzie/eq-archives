<br />
MEXICO CITY, Mexico (Reuters) -- Six British cave divers trapped for five days by rising water in central Mexico turned down local rescue offers on Tuesday, preferring to wait for aid from the British Royal Navy, authorities said.<br />
<br />
The divers were in caverns near the town of Cuetzalan, 110 miles (175 km) northeast of the Mexican capital when rains lifted underground water levels, trapping them.<br />
<br />
Above ground, another six British cave divers have been in touch with their trapped colleagues via telephone, Civil Protection and Red Cross sources told Reuters, adding that they had declined all offers of assistance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Civil protection rescuers are at the scene, but the six Englishmen have refused all help as I imagine they don't trust in the abilities of the Mexican rescuers,&quot; Puebla Red Cross spokesman Jose Trinidad Luna Reyes said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They said they are awaiting the arrival of British Navy specialists,&quot; Luna Reyes added.<br />
<br />
It was not clear if the divers were in the cave for a scientific investigation or practicing caving as a sport or if they were British servicemen.<br />
<br />
Civil Protection sources said the cavers were in good health and had food, but warned that the situation was dangerous.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has rained and the water level (underground) has risen a lot,&quot; said Jose Ignacio Macias, spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency in Puebla state where the cave is located.<br />
<br />
A spokesman at the British Embassy in Mexico City was unable to confirm if the cavers were members of the armed forces, although he referred inquiries to a Ministry of Defense spokesman in London, who was not immediately available for comment.<br />
<br />
The network of underground galleries is one of the most extensive in Latin America. It was first explored by British cavers in the 1970s, who have explored and surveyed more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) of passageways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">03-24-04, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could be they are members of the SBS (Special Boat Service), the British SEAL counterpart.

<br />
That sounds like a group of mentally challenged guys you could hire to scrape the barnacles off the hull of your tugboat.</div></div><hr />

The SAS is the Special Air Service, and by all accounts, they are one of the meanest, most professional counter terrorism and special warfare forces in existence.  <br />
