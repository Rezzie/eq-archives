<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arghificious</div><div class="date">01-19-03, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This quest starts out with Iramai Sacredsoul in Plane of Tranquility at n250 n1350 in a building next to an NPC named Phanti laying on the ground.  Hail Iramai and she mentions something about Phanti.  Ask her about Phanti and she'll say they have their suspicions.  Ask what suspicions and she asks you to bring a bile from one of the rodents in Plane of Disease.<br />
<br />
The bile you need drops off of a named rodent in the caves in Plane of Disease, his name is Rythak.  He does not drop it every time.  He is located in the spider/rat cave.  Enter the cave, at the first big room hook a left, and he's the first rat spawn on the left as you exit the small tunnel.  Loot the bile, and turn it into Iramai Sacredsoul in PoT.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Indigo Orc she speaks of in the preceeding text resides in the Plane of Justice.  To get to him, go like you're going to Mavuin, or the deathrow area, and instead of going right at the T junction at the bottom of the stairs, go left, thru the door and right.  Brugga is his name, and he is in the third room (I think?) on the way down, the door is on the right.<br />
<br />
For the next part you have to be non kos and have 100 in Orc Language.  I taught myself Orc, actually not too hard, just takes a bit of time.  Spend one practice point at your class trainer into the Orc language, and then just change to it with someone else in the group, doesn't matter if they're in the same zone or not, and spam it until you get a skillup.  Zone, spam it again, etc.  You can only get one skillup per time zoned if you teach yourself.  Took me about an hour to get it up to 100.<br />
<br />
I don't know what faction you have to have with Brugga in PoJ in order to have him respond to you.  I am an enchanter and charmed him, and that worked, so you may want to bring an enchanter along to charm, as that will take your faction up to indifferent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hand Brugga the purified bile.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The 'gnomemade crawlerpoison' is mechanical clockwork venom from the mechanical spiders in the Plane of Innovation.  The stinger from a Nettling Wraith is a fairly common drop in the Plane of Nightmare off of Nettling Wraiths.  The venom sack drops off of the Terror Matriarch at the spider camp (spawns in between the two consorts) in the Plane of Nightmare.  She is a 3 day spawn, hits in the mid 600's, unslowable, spawns a baby spider bout every 30 seconds, or at 66% and 33% life.  Turn all three of those in to Brugga and you get the vial of opaque fluid.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Turn the fluid and the bile into Iramai and she will give you the Symbol of Torment, which allows you access into the Plane of Torment.  I don't have the exact quest text she gives you on the final turn in, because EQ crashed (go figure).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Thanks to Cerrick for mailing me what he had of the quest already, and to the PoD group that let me loot that bile yesterday   Edited by: Arghificious at: 1/19/03 5:55:04 pm</div></div><hr />

I don't know how people find the time and energy to figure this stuff out. It's hard enough to complete a quest that has been explicitly spelled out.<br />

But I'm bothered at SOE for requiring the venom sack off the named spider in PoN. As was pointed out that spider is a three day spawn. Only one key every three days??? /sigh</div></div><hr />

Drops 4 Venom sacks every time so 4 keys every 3 days. One full 65 group can handle her if they know what they are doing, you must have crowd control for the adds or they tend to go for the healers and we all know distracted healers with an unslowed mob hitting for 600 to 800 a pop is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
The clockwork poison is a very rare drop, maybe 1 in 20 or 30 spiders add in that there is about 1 spider per 40 regular mobs in PoI..... You get the idea.<br />
<br />
As for wanting to xp in PoTorment... Well honestly for me it is not a matter of wanting to hunt there, but more of the ability to say look, I did this, I am in a guild with less than 5 active people but I still made it to a place that N ToV+ guilds held as thier own. I did it with my groups help and no one else... That's why I do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just one question though....<br />
<br />
Does this pathway to PoTorment screw you from participating in further flag development, ie the alternate pathway to CoD/Grummus?<br />
<br />
I don't want to go thru all this and find out I need to go thru TT kill anyways to get more flags</div></div><hr />

If a mob drops 5 of the same thing and all lore/no drop its kinda obvious.  You rule for posting this, thats my opinion, and I thank you =)  Now for me and Dirth to get to it)).<br />

Correct me if I'm wrong but it doesn't look like there are any mini quest flags like some other quest, and after handing in the purified bile to the orc I don't see anything back to hand back in.  My question is if you could just hand in the stinger, venom, and sac to the orc and get back the fluid and finish quest.  If I can find someone to MQ the venom sac I'll try it tonight and let you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kreel Tekai</div><div class="date">01-21-03, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need Bile..  Oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I made a mistake and turned in only the potion thingy first, and she asked for both of the items, so I quickly turned in the bile and got the key, so if someone else has the bile you can most likely MQ it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kauu Alcotha</div><div class="date">01-21-03, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer a previous question, Yes this does &quot;screw&quot; up your flagging for progression to the higher planes in a way.<br />
<br />
The single player flag quests for CoD, PoTorment, HoH, and PoTactics all allow you to enter the zone.  Which if you are not in a guild that can do a raid to drop the requisite mob, this is a perfectly viable option to gain access.  However they do not give you the required flag for progression onto the next plane in the line as you would if you completed the flag via killing Grummus, TT, AD, or Behemoth respectively.  Therefore, if you do the single player quest to get access to CoD, even though you are able to later go and kill Bert, you won't be able to receive the necessary flag unless you had previously gone back and killed Grummus again to gain his flag for CoD.<br />
<br />
So although you are able to enter one of these planes, you can only really expect it to be another exp type zone until you are able to get the real flag from the intended raid encounter.</div></div><hr />

Luckily for me I couldn't get the matriarch sac last night so didn't try to do the turn ins lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anonymous</div><div class="date">01-21-03, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the real question besides just haveing acess is why anyone would want to do this quest for acess. The exp in there abosulty blows and like every mob is a cleric. The only good thing in there for those not in large guilds is the ultra rare bloody tormentor parts to make tormenter stir fry.<br />

grats for completeing the quest though  <br />

What's to say that the quest isn't the 'real flag' and there aren't more quests in the other planes that just have not been discovered yet....<br />

Think outside the box, don't be a sheep.</div></div><hr />

Find Seer Mal Nae`Shi in Plane of Knowledge, she is in the building closest to the Plane of Tranquillity stone.  Sit down in front of her and say, 'Why guided meditation?' and she will give you a list of all of your flags.  If you used an access key (like this one) and then killed a boss mob in the zone (ie Saryn) you still couldn't get further flags without killing the boss mobs usually required to get into the zone you quested for (in this case you quested for Plane of Torment where you would normally have to Terris Thule). Saying to the Seer 'Retrieve my memories?' (or something like that, she'll say exact phrase in hail text) to see which mobs you still need to get flag from to advance (in this case she would say that you needed to go back and kill Terris Thule).  I know it was probably confusing, but hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_WarderElured</div><div class="date">01-22-03, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.  I already knew the stupidity with the redundant flags, but I had no idea there was a way to get a list of your current flags at all.</div></div><hr />

Talk about another stupid bottleneck.  <br />
<br />
Odds that I or anyone else in my usual grind group would ever see the matriarch up before some daytime player or other passerby or insane camper spots and ganks it?  Virtually zero.  Yet another zone I'll never see. wheeeeeee....<br />
<br />
Can't get to BoT now either.  we've repeatedly had a couple groups capable of taking the minis in Storms.  Oh, but they're never up now.  Most nights all 3 giant camps are taken and even if they're not, it hardly matters.  The minis are killed early in the evening every single night so they're not up again til very late anyway.  You need 2 minis for every 3 people keyed.  Yep, another idiotic bottleneck.  stupid PoP...<br />

Liks someone said eariler the exp in Torment, HoH and PoD are the suck. If your not going with guildies you probly wont have any fun in them, BoThunder is the only exception to this crappy exp plane and it has turned into the next 60+ ppl grind zone   <br />

<br />
You don't have to know orcish, just turn items in like the original posts notes.<br />
<br />
I did the rat easily with shaman+necro duo, he has low hp, slowable, hit for 409 max.  PH is the 1st Relak and the 2nd Relak (just inside first big room with rats, first rat past that big room).  Don't know if he summons because there's not really room to kite so I didn't try.<br />
<br />
Terror Matriarch went down like a drunken sorority girl to 2 ench's with charm and a cleric.  I dotted some too but the fight didn't last long enough for it to matter.  Ench lull pulled flawlessly.  Pop time is indeed 3 days, but its up on server up.<br />
<br />
For faction I used shaman+necro duo.  Coming out of the room with Jacosh and portal to tribunals, go straight across hall.  You've entered a loop of cells, all the mobs are on the faction you need to kill.  If you don't want to kill guards, fight away from guards.  Respawn is fairly quick, and I never saw anyone else for competition.  Just killed the loop twice and got warmly, no problem, faction went really quick compared to velious or chardok.<br />
<br />
Stinger is common, clockwork venom isn't but PoI is a fun zone even if it is light blue imo.<br />

I eventually got to Ally with prisoners. After killing for hours on end I've managed to bring faction down with prisoners but have seen no visible change for the critters.<br />
Short of having an enc charm and using an alliance item (think that'll work) can anyone think of another way? <br />
<br />
Reportedly amiable or greater is needed, have everything else but the faction.<br />
<br />
P.S. Does anyone know where to find alliance items for non-enc classes easily?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

*Important note on faction with Brugga*<br />
I charmed him and gave him the stuff just fine (at aimiable from charm), but my druid friend handed it in at indifferent and he ate it.  So it seems you need to be aimiable to turn it in to him.  I am going to test if this is MQable - it seems like it might be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However a note of warning:  if you are planning to exp in here or try to solo think again.  The first few mobs at the zone in cast AE silence, and the mobs further in are nasty as well.  Exp is pretty slow and drops are infrequent at best.<br />
<br />
You're better off trying for the key to CoD if exp/loot is all you're after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Toneth Spiritwind</div><div class="date">05-01-03, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is doable, make sure none of the spiders between ent of cave and his spawn spot see invis.  The relak and Rythrak will always see invis, get close enough for it to aggro you and run like hell.  I was surprised to learn that the spiders do not assist rats.  Both the relak and Rythrak are SKs, and HT, I was able to solo both as a 60 druid.  After a while pulls aren't that tough, sometimes it fails cause of various reasons, mainly the relak or Rythrak casting on me and making me visible for all the spiders.  Also Rythrak's aggro message is not quite as large as the relak's so it's harder to tell whether he's coming after you or not.  This won't be a big deal for most cause it's easier to bring a group, but for those of you that are unguilded it might be worth trying.<br />
Note: I haven't tried this in a while so recent patches may have changed something.</div></div><hr />

I did this quest completely solo (as a 65 Wiz)-well, except the Terror Matriarch (I had this drop in my bank for a while already and it would not have been possible to solo this part anyway...hehe).<br />
<br />
It's also possible to camp Rythrak (he does NOT summon and so do his PHs, the Relaks) inside the cave and kill spawn by spawn like I did-he is rare tho but at least he dropped the bile for me at first spawn after almost 4 hours I think. The break in is a lil tricky if see invis spiders are up but doable. The SK's could not send me to hell with their HT but spiders were annoying with their CH from time to time but at the end they were down at my feet. :-) I didn't try the suggestion of the druid above and run Rythrak pass the spiders.It just worked fine inside the cave. <br />
<br />
Parts in PoN and PoI are even more cake.<br />
<br />
I also learned Orcish (and all other languages while I was on it-hehe) just to be able to follow the whole quest dialogue with Brugga-better safe than sorry.:-) Prolly it's not needed for the turn ins. Well, and the faction work in PoJ was fine in the jail area near trials like suggested above. Needed a while (perhaps 2 hours) but it's not too hard to reach warmly. I guess amiably is enough tho.<br />
<br />
ok, thx a again<br />

<br />
When you give bile first to Iramai :<br />
Quote:Iramai Sacredsoul pours the bile into a small flask, there is a puff of green smoke, which turns white as it floats into the sky. 'This is good news. It appears that this is the cause for her disease, but I have neither the tools, nor the knowledge to create a cure. There is rumor of an indigo orc who may prove useful to us in this area, but he is imprisoned in the Plane of Justice. Ask him about rare diseases. He was known to have cured many, prior to his imprisonment.<br />
<br />
When you talk with Brugga in Orcish with faction Amiably :<br />
Quote:You say, 'Hail, Brugga'<br />
Brugga says, in Orcish, 'Ragh!' His eyes you with pure hatred. 'Indigo, my dark bowels. . . treachery it is, treachery against the clan. Gharol paid! Paid for it!' He shows you his hands and grins maliciously. 'Paid, he did!'<br />
You say, 'what rare disease ?'<br />
Brugga snorts. 'You have someone that needs killing, or someone that needs saving? It not matter to Brugga, but you smell of a hero, so Brugga think there someone need saving. Well Brugga have time, so you give Brugga the disease and Brugga see.'<br />
<br />
Just after you handed vial of purified bile to Brugga :<br />
Quote:Brugga dips his finger into the flask and tastes the liquid, 'Hmm, someone start work on this already and it still vile. This nothing that Brugga have trouble to cure, we just need stronger toxins to drive this one back. Brugga need a gnome made crawlerpoison, a venom sack from the Terror Matriarch, and the stinger from a Nettling Wraith, Brugga make you a cure.'<br />
<br />
Just after you handed the 3 components to Brugga :<br />
Quote:Brugga says,in Orcish, 'Yes, Brugga work with this.' Brugga chants and makes strange gestures while mixing the objects in his mortar and pestle. 'Ok, Brugga finished now. You have your cure, give cure with the bile and that will heal. You go now, Brugga done talking.'<br />
<br />
<br />
After you handed the 2 vials, bile and cure to Iramai :<br />
Quote:Iramai Sacredsoul says 'Hmm, it looks like I will need both the cure and the purified bile in order to heal Phanti.'<br />
Symbol of Torment has been added to your key ring.<br />
Your group has had keys added to their keyrings!<br />
Iramai Sacredsoul says 'You've done it! Praise the Tranquil! I can already see Phanti's condition improving. Take these, Phanti is not going to be doing any planar exploration any time soon. She was planning on using them to bring her research party into Torment, make good use of them, and stay safe. Thank you again for your help.'<br />
You gain party experience!!<br />
Phanti Sacredsoul stops sweating and a little color returns to her cheeks as Iramai pours the liquid into her mouth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sigh ... this quest was a real pain in the arse.  <br />
BTW I'm really proud to finish it after monthes.</div></div><hr />
