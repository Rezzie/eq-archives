<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">07-22-02, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to make a rogue hybrid to play through the single player game.  Anyway, these are the characters I've been toying with:<br />
<br />
Human Barbarian-rogue.  Extra movement speed, more HP, lots of skill points, barbarian class seems to synthesize well with the rogue.<br />
<br />
Dwarven fighter-rogue.  Lots of hp and feats, and I like the idea of a nasty dwarven pirate.<br />
<br />
Gnome wizard-rogue.  Named out of the family Jansen, a nod to Baldur's Gate II.<br />
<br />
Halfling druid/cleric-rogue.  A really exotic character.<br />
<br />
Which of these classes would you think would make the most enjoyable solo game experience (taking into account the shortcomings of the few henchmen in the game)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hummerlein</div><div class="date">07-22-02, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not any of the hybrids with casters, because you get gimped on hp and never get any cool spells, plus have to worry about that extra stat, whichever it may be.<br />
<br />
i'd say if you want raw hp and power, go dwarven barb/rogue.  leave cha at 6, bump int to 10, leave wis at 8.  then you get 28 points to play with for str/dex/con, so you could have like 16 str, 15 dex, 18 con, 10 int, 8 wis, 6 cha (i think).<br />
<br />
so that's 4 extra hp per level, 5 if you have toughness.<br />
<br />
or if you want to have a lot of feats and skills go human rogue warrior for the bonus feat and extra warrior feat-age.<br />
<br />
imo casters are best left un-multi classed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-23-02, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">be a sneaky bastage, go rogue wizard/sorcerer. extra invis spells. summon a panther companion (is also a rogue and good at sneaking, but can provide combat support), sleep spells for guards (oh how I love walking up and coup de grace'ing 4 guards all sleeping soundly).<br />
<br />
fun combination. 1 Crow bad news<br />
2 Crows myrth<br />
3 Crows a wedding<br />
4 Crows a birth<br />
5 Crows for riches<br />
6 Crows a thief</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">07-23-02, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started up a halfling druid-rogue, works really well at the low levels where my animal companion is two levels higher than me, I guess I'll have to see how it is at higher levels, as the druid spells definitely aren't as good as cleric ones.  (Do animal companions take up exp?)  She will only get up to the level 6 druid spells, but this should be good enough for a healer.  <br />
<br />
The game really seems to favor humans with the extra abilities.  It's weighted so much in favor of them, I don't think there's any race that comes close to being on par with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-23-02, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah Humans do get alot of bonuses in 3rd edition, but really I don't know much of anyone who used to play humans before unless it was for an RP reason. <br />
<br />
other classes got big bonuses, better vision, could multiclass. the only thing a human could do was dual class and go as high exp level as they wanted (course we always through that rule out anyway because lets face it why should an elf only be able to ever get to level 8 as a warrior or whatever? what would be the point in ever playing one if they suddenly magically couldn't advance ever again since in 2nd Ed. onyl humans could dual class)<br />
<br />
Course even in third edition it's nice having dark/low light vision (we still use infravision instead. I liked the mechanics of it much better), heck an elf's search is constantly on and he can still move at full. there are definate benefits to all races now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">07-23-02, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe for a pure class, the other races aren't bad choices, but a multiclass character, which used to be only the non-humans, the human's extra points and feat are pretty useful.  Though I suppose it's just equal to having 12 int, something I probably should have done.  <br />
<br />
Maybe an intelligence caster for a rogue hybrid is the way to go because that way your high intelligence boosts your skill points.  Back to the drawing board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-23-02, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup, if you really want the rogue skilled master go rogue/wizard so your int bumps your skills if you are trying to play the smooth talking pickpocket/con man go rogue/sorcerer so the charisma is high.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i guess i'll always be more melee at heart than caster though.</div></div><hr />

A druid is nice because at least the druid class adds more HP rather than reduces it, and doesn't reduce your to hit chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-23-02, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bah a rogue/wizard can go toe to toe when needed, especialy if you have buffed yourself and have a pet. but even without you can work a bit at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that combination is a bit overpowered, actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-24-02, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">does it let you cross class freely with monk? or once you are monk and change a level you can never level monk again like in table top rules? (aside from oriental adventures)</div></div><hr />

The monk cross-class restrictions do not apply in the Forgotten Realms setting rules, which NWN is based on.  -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 60 Assassin<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-24-02, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">really? I have the forgotten realms book but apparently didn't read it closely enough.  So basic D&amp;amp;D is about the only world where the restriction is? <br />
<br />
Also I noticed monks in NWN start off with Cleave, is that a forgotten realms deal as well? <br />
<br />
I love the FR game world, but I'm the only one in my group apparently since I can't convince anyone to run in that world unless I'm DM'ing and I am teh suc at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loreleli</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had heard that multi-classing stunk in D &amp;amp; D 3rd edit. so I went straight rogue and did nto multi-class. <br />
<br />
I played a fighter/cleric in BG &amp;amp; hated it. <br />
<br />
<br />
How's multi-class in NWN? I have 1 level to go, so I may throw it into something else just for kicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Khoram</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kroe, all of those changes are specific to NWN only; the core 3rd Edition rules should apply to the pnp FR setting.<br />
<br />
Loreleli, you heard multiclassing stunk in 3E? Most people seem to like it. What aspect of a fighter/cleric in BG did you not like? Will make it easier to answer your question on whether or not you should take a level in another class...<br />
<br />
Personally I love 3E multiclassing, whether for RP or min/maxing purposes.<br />
<br />
For an interesting example of 3E multiclassing for RP purposes, check out fyrestryke.com/adilbrand/conan.htm. Someone shows Conan's level progression based upon the old pulp novels. Depending on what Conan was doing in the books, he takes either a level of barbarian, fighter, or rogue. Pretty neat, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Multiclassing in 3E makes SO much more sense than in previouse editions. Humans used to be the only ones who could do change professions, and they could never retyurn to the old one and advance it. Multi classes for non humans were always annoying because of getting only 1/2 or 1/3 the exp of anyone else  so you were always lower level but you couldn't assign levels in particular. ALL levelas had to advance , it was kind of annoying to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, I really need to sit down and read the forgotten realms book for 3E again apprently.  heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But isn't a multiclass character worse off in 3E than 2E?  A pureclass fighter might be level 12 in 2E, and the multiclass fighter-druid will meanwhile be, oh, probably a 8 fighter-10 druid.  In 3E, the multiclass fighter druid will be 6-6.  A level 6 fighter is not worth half a level 12, is it? <br />
<br />
Isn't a multiclass say, a 11 barb, 9 rogue going to be pretty weak as both a barbarian and rogue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a level 12 fighter would equal out to about a level 6 or 7 fighter/5 or 6 druid in 2E I believe, but in 3E he could be a 6 fighter/6 druid, or a 8 fighter/4 druid, or a 4 fighter/8 druid.<br />
<br />
so it REALLY allows for origionality and control in what you play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Syllestrae FV</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cleric rogue is nifty.  Cuts down on rest time, and you can use your pet (summoned or death domain) to run up and fight stuff so you can sneak attack with your bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a tip for newbie multiclassers--<br />
If you are trying to make a rogue who is going to be the second class of the two, unless you're making a mage, make rogue your first class.  <br />
<br />
The first level you get 4 times as many points as future levels, so you can take a level in rogue, then two in your other class, then alternate.  If you lead with other class, then take rogue, your skills fall too far behind.</div></div><hr />
