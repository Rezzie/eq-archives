Simply pop into your local gamestore and preorder it and you get a CD that allows you into the beta.<br />
<br />
There is no lockpicking or hiding and sneaking as EQ players know it currently, but there is enough variations on a rogue to let most people enjoy themselves.<br />
<br />
And the graphics... oh mommy the graphics are so nice...  Puts all the other online games to shame there in my book.  Hey, $5-10 for a pre order.  Give it a try.<br />

<br />
There are more than 10 open beta's for a number of mmog themed games, unless you are a rabid fan there is no reason to put your faith in this game by paying to get in beta and then continue to pay for the ongoing beta otherwise known as a &quot;paid subscriber&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am still looking for my email back from them, but lineage beta is only a backup if I don't get in the w0w beta. back to daydreaming<br />

Which really worries me about the depth WoW will actually have beyond the 'casual gamer' market. PvP servers will hopefully keep me in WoW for a long time, but so far, doubt I could stomach a multi year EQ set in WoW textures all over again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_JookaWoo</div><div class="date">03-02-04, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My disapointment lies in player impact on WoW. Seems it will not be in game other than 'isolated instanced areas' which probable wont have any effects outside of those areas. Which means no real player generated content. When WoW could be so much more. While I understand the gripes about PvP and @#%$.(fact is @#%$ are in EVERY online game) Warcraft series for me was on B.Net, the campaigns were nice but not even close to the amount of fun B.Net has provided. Blizzard seem to be out to try and kill EQ rather than set there own path and do the Warcraft name justice.</div></div><hr />

Paying is just a guarenteed way to get in. From what i've seen so far, it seems ok, graphics are some of the best i've seen but i'm interested in gameplay for the most part ( i stuck with old world models in eq for 4 years  ) and i'm not experienced enough to comment on it just yet. Btw the way that the dark elves run is real funny looking</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the EQ killer,for me personally until they come out with a true dynamic world game,i cant really see anything Topping out on EQ or all the clones that have been published.<br />
<br />
That doesnt mean some of the new games this year wont be decent,or even good. Just disappointed that as a gamer i seem to be stuck with the same Generation 1.25 online games that came out 4-5 years ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LorinaEQ</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to clarify that it is $5 to hold the game on preorder which gives you the right to beta test Lineage 2.  Once you've paid the $5, you dont pay a fee to play; and you get the money off the game should you decide to buy it when it goes live.  Some stores are even giving the cdrom away with people who preorder with no payment upfront.  Your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
The NDA prohibits me from listing pros and cons of the game.  BUT I can say rogue types are fun to play, and the graphics are fantastic.  As soon as allowed I'll post links to actual screenshots of my rogue and mystic.<br />
<br />
Again, it may not kill EQ for everyone, but, man, I've met hundreds of people from EQ in the beta; and everyone agrees it will either be an addition to the addiction or a replacement for EQ for them. Ron<br />

Took about 20 minutes for me to get the email, you then have to use a link and conform or somesuch thing.  Buddy of mine did it for me while I was making sure the food wasn't burning.  BTW, if you get a code and decide to download the game instead of using the CD, expect a long wait while it sets up.  Took me over an hour on the second computer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">03-06-04, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah it took about two hours after registering the game on my PlayNC account for it to actually read as registered.<br />
<br />
I've only played a bit so far, I guess coming from another very fun beta game right now *cough* I'm just not liking the comparison. I don't doubt that this game will probably be fun once I get higher level.. it's just a matter of getting higher level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Doofy Rainbowfloatar</div><div class="date">03-07-04, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sounds like a cool idea...pay $5 - $10 to beta test it...if you don't like it...don't buy the game. Save yourself like $50.<br />
<br />
Unlike FFXI...total crap imho. I'm waiting for the day when a company with some balls comes along and decides to make an mmorpg that's actually fun.<br />
<br />
-Doof</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LorinaEQ</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to add this info, since it is kinda cool compared to what other companies are doing right now.<br />
<br />
I had a problem in game, and did the standard contact a GM thing while filling out a bug report as well (that is the idea of beta testing after all, to find bugs.)  I get contacted by a GM within minutes, who not only fixes my problem, but thanks me for the bug report as well.  And, get this, they are going to have Customer Service support in the USA for their North American customers.  Better time zone usage, better language skills and mastery of slang and nuances and such means hopefully better customer service will result.<br />
<br />
With so many American companies shipping jobs off to India, it is nice to see NCSoft (a Korean company with a US branch) sending jobs our way.  It shows a commitment to their potentially largest client base.<br />
<br />
So, as soon as Lineage 2 goes live, it looks like they're getting the $38.85 a month I used to give SOE for three accounts on EQ.  If I can afford to, I might keep one EQ account active, but I'm not so sure at the moment.<br />
