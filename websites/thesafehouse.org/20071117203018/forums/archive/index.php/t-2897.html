People could play GM for threads, each person could only have one character, there could be all sorts of campaigns, etc? Using standard D&amp;amp;D-ish rules for classes and such. Maybe use one of those online dice-roller programs to formulate combat damage, and such.<br />
<br />
My rl group has pretty much broken up and I can't find anyone else in the area (trust me, I've looked) and I figure: Hey, the Safehouse is filled with great roleplayers.<br />
<br />
Perhaps something in a chatroom format (passworded, of course)? I think there are plenty of javascript chats you can put in EZboards (guild has one). One person could make chat, password it, invite people via PMs, set a person limit, so on and so forth...<br />
<br />
Just something to think about, if you havent already</div></div><hr />

<br />
My friends do play, but lightly, and I never really get any playing done.  And I want to play.<br />
<br />
I bet we could get some really great campaigns going over Java chat or mIRC or maybe even threads here on the board (but the 1 minute thing might slow it down a bit).<br />
<br />
I think it's a great idea.<br />

Count me in, as long as I won't have to commit any regular time to it. My RL just won't allow that nowadays. That means I can't GM either, although it would certainly be interesting. Forgotten Realms would be highly preferred if we are going D&amp;amp;D (never cared much for any of the other official Campaign Settings), and either 2nd ed or 3rd ed will be good</div></div><hr />

Don't really need dice, back in the day we played AD&amp;amp;D a lot we often ended up with missing dice or totally flubbed and no one brought the dice! There used to be several damn good random number generator programs built just to streamline D&amp;amp;D fights. I'll do a search while at work and try to post some cool tools to help do this.

I don't suppose, us all being newbies here, that ye could let me DM.  I have about a newbies level of DMing... did it once!<br />

<br />
We're gonna go with 2E (in my opinion much simpler and friendlier for new gamers, and much more fun /cha-ching, points with Glip).<br />
<br />
You all need a copy of the Player's Handbook, which you can find somewhere on the web in Adobe format I'm sure, and I'll gather up the rest of 'em.<br />
<br />
And, everyone get a set of dice or a dice rolling program.<br />
<br />
Everyone who wants to play, we can vote on a way to play... either message board, java chat, or chat program (mIRC, I'd say, as not everyone has AIM, ICQ, or MSN Messenger... this isn't assuming everyone has mIRC, but that it's a very easy-to-use program and it can stand the middle ground between people fighting over AIM vs. ICQ, etc... myself, I refuse to install ICQ on my system  ).

<br />
<br />
First question depends on the DM. My DM just allows us to give us whatever stats we want, as long as he thinks they're fair and make sense.<br />
<br />
Question about death is: Usually, unless there's a damned good reason for it, and I use &quot;damned&quot; literally, if you die you are dead forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elerion</div><div class="date">03-01-02, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote:  Usually, unless there's a damned good reason for it, and I use &quot;damned&quot; literally, if you die you are dead forever.  <br />
<br />
I suppose you are talking of constitution death here? Because at higher levels when the priests have resurrect spells, you can die 10 times in a game session and be resurrected each time (unless you run out of constitution, or get &quot;gored&quot;)<br />
<br />
As for your first question, there are a billion ways to make your characters. In my latest campaign I simply asked my players to come up with a name, class/race, preferred weapons/spells, background, and general stat distribution (ex. &quot;My warrior wants high constitution and stremgth, but you can dump his intelligence, wisdom and charisma low&quot;), and I made the characters. Saves a LOT of time in the first session, and all the characters are rougly equal. With inexperienced players, whole campaigns can be thoroughly ruined if one character is a lot more/less powerful than the others, which often happens if players get to make their own chars.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In two years of playing with my DM, he only had an NPC priest ressurection one thing.<br />
<br />
It was a dog.  <br />
<br />
Needless to say, this DM kept his players on their toes. My first character (centaur magician) died a month after I started playing, but my next character (clockwork thief) survived longer.<br />
<br />
Character advancement was always pretty slow with him, so none of our spell casters ever got a high enough level to perform ressurections/reincarnations.<br />
<br />
However, the background of one of the characters was a Paladin who had been reincarnated in the form of a kobold with 4 STR and 5 CON. That was funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elerion</div><div class="date">03-02-02, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the best reason to make the characters based on new players' wishes instead of letting them make them themselves, is to keep them away from numbercrunching and trying to make the &quot;best&quot; character. If you have never played RPG's before, you are used to playing games where &quot;winning&quot; is the goal. Therefore, new players will always seek the strongest class/race and the highest stats, instead of making a character they want to roleplay. By giving them a list of classes and races (and explaining them briefly what they are and do, NOT the rules related to the classes), they will hopefully choose the kind of character they will like to roleplay. <br />
<br />
And of course, like I said, it prevents the session from being mucked up by unequal characters and the following envy. (I also started them at level 3, to fit the storyline, and to skip the first two levels where mages are nothing more than a laughing matter in the hands of an inexperienced player, ruining their fun)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Koru</div><div class="date">03-02-02, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, people grow out of this though. Most of them do at least, some just never get past mini-maxing.<br />
<br />
The characters I've enjoyed the most have all been considered underpowered. The slightly neurotic scholarly mage who in a dangerous situation involving goblins would start to tell everyone about the facinating goblin culture (I think the only spells he had were rope trick, detect good, and read magic). The little middle age halfling housewife turned to warrioring to save her farm (and keep the PCs from getting sick in that awful awful cold). The cowardly bard with a bad case of stagefright...<br />
<br />
It's not so bad getting a char handed to you, there's still lots you can do to customize them.</div></div><hr />

I think that's what a lot of people would be familiar with, seeing as how lots of us have played the Baldur's Gate series. &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ...

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">03-03-02, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game that I play uses mIRC.  Our DM has a bot that does all our dice rolling for us, and we can get and send private messages to other players or the DM.  One of the guys in the group started writing his own chatroom software, but it was kinda buggy and then he got busy IRL and so we went back to mIRC.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, I'm not sure why we ever wanted to switch in the first place, since IRC is pretty durn stable   <br />
<br />
One thing of warning for a prospective DM.  We've got 7(?) in our group now, and our DM feels overwhelmed at times, taking care of handling private messages, whatever dialogue he's taking care of in the main room, and typing up descriptions of the things we see, even when he has a lot of the stuff typed up beforehand to cut and paste it into IRC.  Of course it certainly doesn't help that our group hasn't managed to do what he 'wanted' us to do yet, in 2 years of gaming LOL.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, I'd   strongly suggest that if you get an online game going, either you have 2 DMs, one to do the grunt work and one to handle the NPC interactions, or you limit the group to 6 or fewer players.  The alternative is frustration by both the DM, who is always a couple lines behind the action, and the players, who don't think that they're getting the attention they need for when they are attempting to do some action or another, and the DM doesn't see a message they send because he's busy dealing with something else.<br />
<br />
Edit: I'll have to find out what the scoop is on the dice program and get back to you.  I believe it is something that our DM has set up in his IRC stuff, since I just logged into our chatroom by myself and the dice function didn't work for me   Llabaktharr Gigglegiggler<br />

Lot to read here.<br />
<br />
Let's see... no, I will not be giving out free ressurections.  Dead is dead.<br />
<br />
As for stats... well, let's see, I have two people that want to play special ranger classes and I'm letting them roll on a special roll table that makes it quicker.  Basically, there are predetermined sets of stats (There are 12 sets, each with varying numbers in each stats... you roll a d12 and get one set of stats, instead of rolling each stat separately.)  If we could find one that worked for every class, that'd be great and make it quicker.<br />
<br />
That or I can just have you roll out each stat independently.  <br />
<br />
Also, to each his own... you can decide your character in any order you want.  Roll stats first, create class/race, go back and change... whatever.  I have plenty of time.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'm going to be doing a lot of work and you with me.<br />
<br />
How many do we have?  I'd like a quick head count please.  Everyone that wants to play, post a &quot;Me&quot; or an &quot;I&quot;... you get the gist.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I've DMed once and off the top of my head I was able to create enemies that my friend's characters were able to kill with challenge but not death.  I doubt I'll be killing you off... unless you anger me I'll try my hardest to challenge but not kill you... unless you want to die (I like doing very risky stuff with my characters  ) Edited by: Trolo Jesterkinng at: 3/4/02 7:11:00 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
urza9082: Okay, you have just entered 'The Tavern With a Man Shrouded In Darkness In the Back Corner Inn'<br />
Aaron Of AZ: Right.. I head inside.<br />
urza9082: Ok, you go into the bar and there's a guy with a big black cloak in the back corner<br />
urza9082: He's trying to not be noticed<br />
urza9082: But his big, black cloak kind of gives him away<br />
Aaron Of AZ: Is he smoking a pipe, too?<br />
urza9082: Yes, a pipe<br />
urza9082: And you can't see his face<br />
urza9082: That's the key<br />
urza9082: But you can bet it's rugged, unshaven, and damned handsome<br />
urza9082: So you screw around a bit<br />
urza9082: And get drunk<br />
Aaron Of AZ: *Hic*<br />
urza9082: And he yanks you into a room and pulls from his pants...<br />
Aaron Of AZ: &quot;No, not that!  You're disgusting!&quot;<br />
urza9082: Oops, sorry. Anyways, he pulls out his half broken sword<br />
Aaron Of AZ: &quot;Dude, you trip and fall on that or something? How long'll it take to heal?&quot;<br />
urza9082: And he's like &quot;Yo, I'm Aragorn, I'll be your guide for this quest... if you look to the left you can see the Black Riders&quot;<br />
urza9082: &quot;And they're trying to kill us, so let's duck into this other room and I'll tell you about my cool sword... I like swords... I have another sword, and it's big&quot;<br />
Aaron Of AZ: &quot;ooooh... big sword&quot;<br />
urza9082: &quot;Ha!  Well this broken one is even bigger, if I could get it fixed, damn it&quot;<br />
Aaron Of AZ: &quot;Ooooh... bigger sword.  Sword envy&quot;<br />
Aaron Of AZ: *drunken laugh*<br />
Aaron Of AZ: Bwahaha<br />
urza9082: Ok, so, like, the guy shows you his sword<br />
urza9082: And tells you that he's not really named Aragorn<br />
urza9082: But actually named Tim<br />
urza9082: He says that if you wish to find the Holy Grail, you gotta follow him<br />
urza9082: So, you follow him, and end up watching a fierce battle between a few knights<br />
urza9082: It's the one in black defeats the one in green in a most horribly bloody way<br />
urza9082: And you try to get past now that the battle is over<br />
urza9082: After telling you that you are repressing him and you try and push him aside, he claims that 'now he sees the violence inherent in the system' and he attacks you<br />
Aaron Of AZ: I shoot him in the head!<br />
Aaron Of AZ: Twice!<br />
urza9082: Alright<br />
urza9082: After a fierce battle, you claim his arms and legs as trophies and continue on, being called a 'nanny girl' the whole way<br />
urza9082: He is extra mad<br />
urza9082: And tries to hop after you because of those arrows<br />
urza9082: and his torso just falls over and he eats dirt<br />
urza9082: You outrun him, though.. And that's all for tonight!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds about enough for one DM.<br />
<br />
DreamingofLostThings, are you Andreas Aulie on AIM?  I promised that person a spot, so I'll give him/her one no matter how many others we have.  And Bruenorr, he's got a spot too.<br />
<br />
I think I'm gonna call it at 6.  If I get a helper DM, I'll take more, or another DM can just start another campaign.</div></div><hr />

Ok, so a couple things I would like to know.  <br />
<br />
What software?<br />
<br />
What date/time?<br />
<br />
Someone willing to do a website/message board?<br />
(I am a programmer and web type guru so willing to help) <br />

I already came up with a couple concepts depending on party make up.  Which leads to to another questions...will we know ahead of time the other classes in the party? (I would hate to see 6 druids, hehe (that was a bad joke)).<br />

Damn, I've got like three things going on that cause me to get new IM names on my list every few days, so I can't keep up.<br />
<br />
Ok, so we got 6.<br />
<br />
That sounds good.  Why doesn't everyone post here what class/race they want (sides Ninara and Bruenorr) and put at least 2 or 3 selections depending on what we get.<br />

We already have two rangers, so no more rangers.</div></div><hr />

It's not wise though to let me have mass destruction spells, I ah, have been known to revert to NE when it comes to minor spell decisions. (like, do I cast this fireball and incinerate my friends as well as the bad guy or just hope they can hack the bad guy by themselves?) I figured they deserved it for making me pick fireball rather than a funny non-combat spell. The bastards.<br />
<br />
So mainly I'm thinking fighter, multi classed cleric, or thief of the usual vanilla races. We're talking 2nd ed here right? What kits would you have open, the 2 FR book kits? The class book kits? Tymoran cleric, possibly multi'd, sounds like fun. Wanted to play one for a while.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, Koru, I think a multi-classed cleric would fit very well.  We have no other cleric volunteers yet, so I think I'll say that I'd prefer that over something else, unless someone else says they would do a cleric.<br />
<br />
Zulian, wizard for you, that would be good.<br />
<br />
Two rangers, wizard, multi'ed cleric (maybe cleric/thief... that would be an interesting combo).  That sounds like a pretty good party.<br />

<br />
Dimensionalist: This uncommon specialist is a student of magic that relies on the manipulation of space, time, and dimension. The dimensionalist is familiar with all kinds of extradimensional pockets, planes, and sources of power. While other wizards can make use of these dimensions, the dimensionalist has a much clearer understanding of what he is doing and why when he casts spells of this school. Non-Euclidean geometry and planar relationships are diffi*cult material, even for a wizard; a character must have an Intelligence (Intelligence/Reason in the Skills &amp;amp; Powers rules) of 16 or better to grasp the more esoteric concepts required to master this kind of magic.<br />
<br />
The school of dimensional magic is listed in Appendix 3 of this book. It includes spells such as rope trick, dimension door, distance distortion, and maze. Dimensional magic is opposed by the schools of enchantment/charm and necro*mancy, since these philosophies have nothing to do with extraplanar studies or spells.<br />
<br />
The dimensional specialist gains the normal advantages for specialization as described earlier in this chapter; spells belonging to the school of dimensional magic are listed in Appendix 3. At 8th level, the dimensionalist gains the power to disappear by stepping into a pocket dimension once per day. While in the pocket dimension, he is detectable only by spells that can discern dimensional openings and is immune to any attack, but he also has no way of knowing what's hap*pening in the place he left until he chooses to step back into the real world. The dimensionalist may remain for up to one hour before he is forced to exit and can take any actions he desires (sleeping, reading, drinking a potion, or so on) while inside. Note that the pocket dimension's point of exit is always the exact same place the dimensionalist entered the dimension. Also, no spells that would allow the dimensional*ist to leave the pocket without first reentering the real world can function in the extradimensional place, including teleport, dimension door, shadow walk, and similar enchantments. At 11th level, the dimensionalist may bring one other human-sized creature or an object weighing less than 500 pounds with him; at 14th level, he may bring up to five companions or an object weighing 1,500 pounds.<br />
<br />
The dimensionalist is a very unusual wizard, with access to some of the strangest spells in the game. A high-level dimensionalist can be a confounding opponent, calling on rarely seen powers to trap or misdirect his enemies. Dimen*sionalists have few attack spells, but excel in avoiding trouble or circumventing obstacles.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh, and even though it's not actually part of the FR setting AFAIK, in BG2: LoD, the main character got the same type of ability, so it isn't really out of place in FR.<br />

<br />
With just two rangers, a multi'ed cleric, and a wizard you guys would already be a bit overpowered, but with such a specialized and probably quite powerful wizard class, I think that would push it beyond the edge.<br />
<br />
I think I'll probably limit you to the most basic wizard classes... Sorcerer, Illusionist, and... Summoner, is it?  Something like that.</div></div><hr />

        Description: The Academician is a learned scholar whose love of knowledge is matched only by his preoccupation with research. He is fascinated by magic in all its forms and enjoys nothing more than poring over arcane texts and experimenting with exotic magical devices.<br />
<br />
     The Academician spends so much time involved in intellectual pursuits that he tends to neglect his physical skills. He is not a particularly good fighter and avoids combat when he can, preferring negotiation and parley to violence. Still, he recognizes the necessity of combat in certain instances, and will fight valiantly when required. <br />

        Academicians can be found in virtually any culture, but they are most likely to come from large urban areas that provide ready access to libraries, museums, laboratories, and other resources. <br />
<br />
     A character must have a minimum Intelligence of 13 and a minimum Wisdom of 11 to become an Academician. <br />
<br />
     There are no special rules for abandoning this kit. An Academician who becomes disillusioned with the academic life or loses interest in intellectual pursuits can choose to neglect his studies or research, but he is free to resume them at any time. <br />
<br />
     Preferred Schools: The Academician is intrigued by all the schools of magic, but is especially drawn to schools with a wide range of spells, including alteration, illusion, and invocation/evocation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not really overpowered, as they tend to be very physically weak and they specialize in only one or two schools. (And it'd be funny to roleplay.. the poor scholar, hunting kobolds/goblins/gnolls)</div></div><hr />
