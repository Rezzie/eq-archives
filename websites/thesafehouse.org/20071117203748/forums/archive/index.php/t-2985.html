No dice rolling <br />
No stats<br />
No whatever<br />
You just imagine yourself as the character, <br />
The gm decides stuff<br />
<br />
Imho these games run very very smoothly if the players aren't rowdy  Edited by: Pdrago shadowflight at: 10/21/02 7:52:47 am</div></div><hr />

You need the right GM and players, otherwise the &quot;recrimination phase&quot; can get pretty bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
And it works better as a one-off than it does as a continuing campaign, if you're doing it as a way to avoid paperwork.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">10-22-02, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We used to run/play larps in this fashion every year on Halloween with everyone we could collect from running the haunted house. It was pretty cool, because half (if not more) of the players didn't know squat about gaming, which made it much easier to play with no game mechanics.<br />
<br />
I also did something similar but not nearly as rules free, one time a GM asked us to make chars for a system based solely on trying to recreate ourselves, what we thought our stats would realistically be and what skills/knowledges we have, ignoring the normal creation points etc. We still used the rules for gameplay, but also were urged to do what we think we'd do as people, not as gamers or players or characters. It was very fun, but very mayhemish and not as conducive to continued play as our GM would have liked..  Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was usually quite fun, although sometimes the characters / situations were a bit power-trippy.</div></div><hr />
