Looking for a guild that actually gets stuff done, has fun together, helps each other out, and is still pretty laid back? If you're on Xeth, look no further than Order of the Hammer. We've got adventurers of all levels, harvesters at the highest levels, and T5 crafters across the board, and we're working on our guild hall. Check us out!<br />
<br />
About us:<br />
<br />
Order of the Hammer was formed by a group of friends from the Vanguard beta. We have been around since day one and continue to be one the leading casual guilds on Xeth. Our goal is to provide a comfortable home to all in every sphere of interest. We promote and expect honesty and integrity among our members. You'll find helpful advice on our forums and from members in-game. We run weekly events for all spheres and encourage participation by our members.<br />
<br />
We feel that freedom of choice for our members is paramount to their enjoyment. There are no attendance requirements for any guild event, but participation is what makes a guild come together. We don't loudly recruit, but prefer to lead by example. We let our actions speak for themselves and try to reach quality people by getting to know them.<br />
<br />
We expect our members to uphold the good name of the Order of the Hammer. This is accomplished by random acts of kindness and helpfulness. We ask our members to commit to only what they are comfortable with. Never to overtax one’s self to avoid burnout. We have some amazing, gifted people in our guild. Are you ready for Hammer time?
