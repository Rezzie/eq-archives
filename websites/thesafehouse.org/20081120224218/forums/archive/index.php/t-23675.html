I thought that Naruto was supposed to go on a six month filler arc, and I feel like I havent downloaded an episode since last fall. Yet from what I understand, it's still filler (Read: Garbage.) Anyone know if there is a date or estimate where they will get back onto the manga storyline?<br />
<br />
Bleach, same question. I mean, It feels like its only been a month or 2 since the filler (vampires WHAT?!) storyline began. I dont mind this filler as much as the naruto stuff, but its still annoying to read/watch something when you know that there are very specific boundries placed on the medium (IE, no one important can die or change or grow in any significant way.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-03-06, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naruto was scheduled for a minimum of 1 year's of filler, i.e. 56 episodes. Bleach, on the other hand, hasn't been scheduled for anything, at least nothing public knowledge. But I'd expect about the same amount of filler Naruto has. As it is, the Bleach and Naruto manga's are only about 20 episodes behind the current arc, an arc which (in both cases) are barely 1/4 done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-03-06, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naruto is already past the point where the studio originally said the fillers were going to end.  But if they were doing one full year of fillers(which is 52 btw, not 56)we're currently at week 44 of the fillers, and the last non-filler aired May 10th last year.<br />
<br />
It pisses me off that there's so many fillers, but at least they are doing them right by 1.  Putting them all in a space where theres a time skip in the manga, so they aren't interfering with any of the storyline, and 2.  They are all together.  Which is just convenient because it means this whole thing just lifts right out when you rewatch the series later.  And at 50+ fillers, we better not catch up to the manga again for a LONG time.<br />
<br />
Bleach, who knows.  Depends how far ahead they want to let it get from the Manga.  I suspect it will be awhile.  From what I understand though they are ******* them up because the fillers are already interfering with future plot elements from the manga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">04-03-06, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Supposedly fillers will end by ep 182. For naruto.. as for bleach I assume after they beat all the bad guys in the bounto(bound) whatever arc. Naruto fillers are just awful, bleach fillers not that bad though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-03-06, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoops, you're right, it's 52 not 56. That's what I get for posting at 6am.<br />
<br />
Also, 52 episodes of filler is only 26 episodes of manga story. This next arc is looking to be the longest arc yet, which places it at what? at least 60 episodes? It won't be hard to catch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">04-03-06, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where was the story when the anime left off before going into filler on Naruto?  It's been a while and I forget...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">04-03-06, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can download manga scanlations if you want.. Manga is sometimes even better than Anime in some aspects, I read latest managa for both Naruto and Bleach and it still doesnt stop me from wanting to watch Anime of it, it is actually better because I don't get all crazy about fillers being too long. ;o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">04-03-06, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dislike double-dipping a series by reading the manga and watching the anime at the same time, as it is impossible not to compare the two. Seems to be more enjoyable to do one at a time, as not to ruin the experience by nit-picking the show to death. <br />
 <br />
(I'm enjoying the Bleach filler, 'cause I don't have any pre-concieved notions of the story being supposedly &quot;different from the manga', and somehow that being an automatic bad thing as some people seem to think.):poke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-04-06, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same, I'm only going to watch one media for a story, and in any Shonen series, that's gonna be anime.  Since the whole point is the fights, and the fights are 10x better animated.<br />
<br />
Bleaches fillers are definatly of much higher quality than Naruto's.  It's apparently one really long arc also(so far), which is also good because it gives time for it's story to develop.  I mean, they just introduced ALOT of Bounto this week.  I'm looking forward to a series of 1 on 1 fights against most of the shows main characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">04-04-06, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's nice animated, but the art by the original manga-ka is 100x better, and consistant.  With the animation you never know from one week to the next whether this one will be animated by the &quot;good&quot; team or one of the lesser ones.<br />
<br />
All depends on which one you value more.  I've loved both the Naruto and Bleach anime, but neither have ever really captured the design of the characters from the manga completely.</div></div><hr />

I've loved both the Naruto and Bleach anime, but neither have ever really captured the design of the characters from the manga completely.Honestly, while it may be the case that the art in the manga is better, with Naruto I don't find that to be the case.  Except for his cover art, none of his **** looks that good to me.  Sometimes it's even worse than the show(the show has some spactacular looking episodes).  And for Bleach, honestly, it looks EXACTLY the same to me.  I think the animators really bust there ass on that show trying to be as exact as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">04-04-06, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Naruto, beware of scanlated art that has been retouched in photoshop to &quot;improve&quot; the pic from crappy scans off of crappy newsprint.  It's why I stopped reading a certain scanlator's naruto, they muddied the artwork beyond recognition.<br />
<br />
As for Bleach... you have to be kidding.  Tite Kubo's style is far more angular.  I question your artistic eye sir!</div></div><hr />
