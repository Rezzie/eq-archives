<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">04-28-05, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About time too! With E3 just around the corner, Sigil has finally started to get into the 'more on this later' issues that gamers have been dying to know more about. In a recent interview with IGN, Sigil layed out the basic class structure of the game, announcing their first four class archetypes, and discussed their strategy of class design and class interdependency. The outlines are still rough, but this is the beginning of real info. <br />
<br />
And in a move that surprised me, they announced yet another new race. All you former darkies in EQ can start rejoicing, because Dark Elves are a now a playable race in Vanguard. <br />
<br />
Brad McQuaid also took some time out to talk to Woody of GUComics about his (and Sigil's) reaction to the SOE Station-Exchange announcement, and what he thinks about virtual sales in general. One quote I found fairly intresting was this. <br />
<br />
Woody:<br />
Isn't that discrepancy the driving force behind why people move toward a virtual merchant though? The &quot;want&quot; to be able to keep up with their friends?<br />
<br />
Brad:<br />
To a degree and for many/most players, I'm sure it is. That's where the temptation comes from, and that's also why our efforts are less on enforcing the issue at the buyer level and more at the seller level. We can at least understand the context of the legitimate player's desire to keep up with others who have more time to devote to these games.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">04-28-05, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both great articles!<br />
<br />
From the IGN one:<br />
<br />
IGNPC: One thing that we've heard about, but haven't really seen in action is the class interdependency. Can you explain what that means exactly?<br />
<br />
Sigil Games Online: Class interdependency takes many forms in Vanguard. In its simplest form, the synergy provided in the basic group structure of one protective fighter, one offensive fighter, one healer and one arcane caster is interdependency. On a more advanced level, witnessing the warrior execute an attack that allows the Rogue (who has been waiting in the shadows) to execute a particularly nasty sneak attack, or the Sorcerer and Necromancer who cast spells that combine into one more powerful spell is interdependency. Interdependence is layered throughout Vanguard and the results are very exciting. <br />
<br />
I've heard little birds talk about his interdependency, it sounds promising.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">04-28-05, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just hope it's implemented differently (and better) than the stupid combat wheel in EQ2...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">04-28-05, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All you former darkies in EQ can start rejoicing, because Dark Elves are a now a playable race in Vanguard. <br />
<br />
And there was MUCH rejoicing!!!   :float :drunks :beer :drunks :float<br />
<br />
I was so worried that I'd have to be a St. Bernard to be evil.  :pulid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">injijo</div><div class="date">04-28-05, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't really excited about Vanguard before, but I think the hype bug just bit me.  I really hope the game lives up to the hype.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aarchistut</div><div class="date">04-28-05, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn never thought i would look at another game as i do EQ1.  I may have to give this one a whirl or two  :blink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elsebet</div><div class="date">04-28-05, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll admit I haven't been following the game closely but from this article alone I'm not seeing what is so revolutionary or groundbreaking about this title.  Reading the interview leads me to believe it has the same tired classes and holy trinity we've seen in many online games, a reactionary combat system like EQ2/FFXI, and corpse retrievals like EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">04-28-05, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">99% of all fantasy RPGs (pen&amp;paper or PC, doesn't matter) use the same basic classes in some way ... not much you can change about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">04-28-05, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll admit, personally, this announcement doesn't excite me very much. I asked a few pointed questions of Sigil a few months ago, about whether or not they would be redefining the traditional roles of &quot;tank&quot;, &quot;damage dealer&quot;, &quot;nuker&quot;, ect..... and I never got a response. It would seem that at least at the archetype level, they are not innovating. But, as Brad has said many times, you build on what works. So while the very surface of classes may seem just like EQ, or EQ2...there are many more layers of class design yet to be announced. I'm hoping that is where the real innovation is.<br />
<br />
<br />
IGN has a few newer screen shots as well...including, can it be? A dude chopping down a tree! Like, really chopping it down. <br />
<br />

<br />
And a few from Gamespot as well, including a pic of a sweet sweet, scimitar wielding dark elf, and a Qalian human. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">04-29-05, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phew...the hits just keep on coming! Gamespot has a video interview with Jeff Butler and Brad McQuaid, where they explain a little more about the class system. I really like how these two address the issues that made EQ un-fun for a lot of people, and how Vanguard is going to work to improve that. It's nice to hear developers talk about how they've screwed up and where things need to change, as much as their grandieous plans for the future. <br />
