What did you do to stay sane while lvl'ing from the mid 30's on? I'm only at 34 now and am really ready to just throw in the towel. If it hadnt been for the BG, and being able to see what I am capable of against people within a few lvls of me the towel would have been throw awhile ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">03-31-02, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sucks for all classes.  Players of all classes feel like they've hit the wall and want to quit.  The mobs are not actually any more challenging in the 30s, they don't do anything different, you just have to kill twice as many the previous level.  This sucks.  The problem is the level of attention required in the game in general, trying to push the right buttons within a couple seconds of something happening.  Get some popcorn or a few beers (depending on your age) and hunker down for the dullest hours of your life.</div></div><hr />

It's the trying to get into a group part that I really hate. Sometimes I have 5 hours to play, but get nothing accomplished because I can't get into a group. I'm looking foward to the PvP server, if there is still xp grinding needed, I think I'm done with DaoC.</div></div><hr />

If you get into a good group, start saying things like, &quot;So, you all want to do this again tomorrow?&quot;  Group with your guild... or find a guild that will group with you if you can't.  If someone treats you well, offer to be their personal slave.  Make donations to druids.  Whatever it takes... group, or you will go insane.<br />

Same goes for the 40s, only moreso. Ciardha Sidhe, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br />
