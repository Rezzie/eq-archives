<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greldek</div><div class="date">05-21-00, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wandering through Crushbone the other night, when a cleric in her 40th season asked if I wanted to<br />
make some really easy money. I told her sure, and she just asked that I help her camp the tower of the<br />
castle, for she wanted the Dragoon Dirk. I said surely a cleric of your power would have no trouble killing<br />
off Dvinn and his group. She said she just wanted someone to talk with, and to chase the runners.<br />
So I agreed, and we got to killing everything in the tower. She asked how much money I wanted for helping<br />
her out, I just said anythings fine. She said well, I have a Serrated Bone Dirk in the bank, and when we are<br />
done, I shall give it to you for a very good price. I was overjoyed with that, for I have wanted the assasins<br />
dagger for a very long time. After about 4 hours of camping the Ambassodor, she had to run and give a guild<br />
mate a resurection. She said she would be back shortly, and we could discuss prices on the dirk. Well after about 1 hour of waiting, I had to sleep for the night(log). I have never heard from that delightful cleric since, but I still keep my fingers crossed.  <br />
