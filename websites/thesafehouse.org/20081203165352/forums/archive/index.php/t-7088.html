<br />
From today's patch message:<br />
<br />
A powerful warder has been seen in the Skyfire Mountains. Those who seek retribution against Ragefire would be wise to speak to her, she may be able to provide information about his whereabouts.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Apparantly now, you Hail said Warder and she gives you a box, then you must hunt down 4 rare named mobs in Skyfire (the wanderers are PHs).<br />
<br />
Only 1 cleric can be doing the quest at once <br />
<br />
1 problem with this I say, 1 cleric gets box, loses ability to play EQ (internet lose, etc etc, Clerical population = screwed)<br />
<br />
But I guess its much much better than the week long camp.<br />
<br />
<br />

Good idea, Bad Idea, Gonna shoot random people at your nearest Starbucks? Discuss</div></div><hr />

Timing the box would suck, but at least it couldn't be broken.  This way, it's really easy to mess it up, just as you pointed out.  CR would be having a field day with non-stop /petitions saying &quot;I think the box giver is broken, no one is in zone looking for shards!  Come help tks tks ~~&quot; --------------------------<br />

I suspect a lot will depend on how frequently the shards drop.  If they're so rare people are spending the same amount of time in the zone looking for the drops as they did camping rage before, this is going to blow big time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I logged on to EQ for lunch and talked with guildmates hunting in Skyfire.<br />
<br />
A cleric without the Shimmering Pearl from the SolA version of Zord hailed the Warder and got a message similar to &quot;You have not done enough to help us catch him.&quot;...basically, paraphrased, &quot;You don't have an item needed to make me give you the box, so come back when you do, k thnx.&quot;<br />
<br />
A cleric of ours who DOES have the Shimmering Pearl hailed him, and he gave her the box.  This was at about 1 PM CST, and I guarantee you she wasn't the first cleric with that Pearl on Xegony to hail the Warder.  I'm saying that &quot;one cleric holds up the process&quot; doesn't seem to be true.<br />
<br />
We have a whole mess of guildmates killing there too, and they're saying that 2 of our clerics each have 2 of the shards needed...and that they are NOT unique (i.e. they are NOT like like PoA quest items with common, uncommon, rare, and ultra-rare versions).  You apparently only need 4 shards period to put in the box.<br />
<br />
They also reported they are dropping off all kinds of mobs, including the spermies, not just certain mobs...a guildmate made a joke about sperms dropping pearls being a sick joke from Verant.    <br />
<br />
And, they just posted that someone announced they had the 4 shards needed and were spawning Ragefire (which shows that it's possible to get all of them in a short time) and that the trigger mob repopped in 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it all may be moot as there is a scheduled (or it's happening now) patch that may very well &quot;nerf&quot; drop rates and/or get stuff fixed to the way it's supposed to be in Skyfire.<br />
<br />
At least this way you NEED to have done everything except Ragefire...previously, you could have a level 1 cleric loot the heart for later use and you weren't losing anything except the time put in to camp it.  This way, if you're going to have an alt loot it, you're sacrificing the time put in by a cleric to get everything except Ragefire done.<br />
<br />
Edit:  It said &quot;everything except Overking&quot; before...it's accurate now.    Rukog DethBryngr<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_melmell</div><div class="date">09-15-02, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah. think 3-4 clerics have the box and shards in my guild or did. dont think this can only be done by one cleric cause yeah, if that cleric quit playing that would screw up the NPC till the next patch or whatever. I know verant is more smarter then that hopefully</div></div><hr />
