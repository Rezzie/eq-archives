<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iustus</div><div class="date">07-31-01, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a summary from the below post follows (thread decayed):<br />
pub13.ezboard.com/fthesaf...=1&amp;stop=40<br />
<br />
Ok. First the rewards.<br />
<br />
The completed item is:<br />
Ethereal Bladed Naginata:<br />
EDIT: it is 35/37 Ratio now, no pic<br />
<br />
Effect: Garzicor's Vengeance (disease based dot/attack debuff)<br />
<br />
If you are one of the lucky classes, you can trade it in for:<br />
Sanctum Guardian's Earring<br />
<br />
(why could this not be all/all?)<br />
<br />
And the casters can trade that in for this:<br />
Pitted Iron Ring<br />
<br />
Mana Flare is 600 mana over 4 ticks<br />
<br />
The good item is obviously the earring. I wish they had made the earring all/all (and the ring as well). I dont see anything on those items that would be unbalancing and it would give some choice.<br />
<br />
If you give the ring back (as I did, I cant use), you do not get the Naginata back, you get nothing.<br />
<br />
So, although I am the first to complete this quest, I have nothing to show for it.<br />
<br />
One more note on Smithing. I suggest you work smithing to 175 and stop there for this quest. It is a lot harder to raise your smithing higher than to just repeat the earlier steps till you succeed. And yes, the only real way to raise smithing over 175 (unless you are an iksar) is to make fine plate armor. If you are an iksar, you could go ahead and trivial out your easy cultural stuff, since it is so easy.<br />
<br />
Ok, the details, but first the summary. (Special thanks to Torlan who compiled most of this summary in the previous thread).<br />
<br />
        PART I - SKYSHRINE<br />
<br />
Note that you must have MAX Ally faction to start this quest or very close to it.<br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:43:37 2001] Oglard says 'Greetings young Wood Elf. Very few of your kind has ever seen the halls you know walk through. You must have provided a great service to our kin for them to allow you passage into this inner sanctum. We welcome you to our ancient home. <br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:43:40 2001] You say, 'thank you'<br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:43:40 2001] Oglard says 'Might, wisdom, and manners? Quite a surprise to see all of these traits in one of the younger races. I am impressed. I see you are a noble creature, one who would treat another creature of nobility with respect.......... 'Oglards eyes suddenly begin to shine with a magical, golden, light. He looks down upon you as if in judgement and asks, 'Tell me Keyno , have you done battle with dragons?' <br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:44:02 2001] You say, 'yes I have done battle with the dragon'<br />
<br />
*note* Saying, &quot;no I have not done battle with the dragons&quot; will result in this.<br />
Olard's eye begin you gleam even brighter, then quickly fade, a frown left apon the wurm's face.<br />
Hmm... I see. Thank you for your information. Good luck in your travels.<br />
You faction standing with the ClawsofVeeshan got worse.<br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:44:02 2001] Oglard 's eyes slowly begin to lose the golden light that flared earlier. He then studies you carefully before saying 'There are many Dragons on this world that do not share our beliefs. If you have done battle with dragons and have lived, then you may be able to help us. <br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:44:11 2001] You say, 'how may i help you?'<br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:44:11 2001] Oglard says 'When a Dragon dies, his spirit leaves his corporeal body and joins Veeshan among the stars. It is our greatest desire, to be without desire, at the time of our death. Even in preperation for battle, we accept that we may die and strive to be empty of desire so that our spirits do not cling to this world when our end has come. For some, however, this is not the case <br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:45:10 2001] You say, 'who are the ones that this is not the case?'<br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:45:11 2001] Oglard says 'When a Dragon dies, and his heart is filled with desire, his spirit will remain here in the filth of this world. The greatest torment is to transcend one's body, and still be confined to this world. Like being trapped within a cell with a single locked door, having the key to unlock it and escape, yet having no hands to use the key. This has befallen one of our comrades. <br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:46:08 2001] You say, 'what comrade has this befallen?'<br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:46:08 2001] Oglard says 'And therein lies our plight. Our fellow Dragon now suffers eternally in unlife, between worlds. We hear his pained howls when we sleep, unable to aid our fallen comrade. He turned his back on us centuries ago, and joined the Ring of Scale. In response to this we erased his name and bloodline, along with the others who left, from our memories and books. He is still Dragon though, and does not deserve the fate he's been dealt. Without his name, we are helpless. <br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:47:07 2001] You say, 'what is his name?'<br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:47:08 2001] Oglard says 'Unfortunately our libraries have no record of him. We know of his death from 2 sources only. Our Lord Yelinak was the first to hear his tormented howling. Then the rest of us slowly began to hear him as well. A chosen few left our home to find his corpse if possible. We were surprised to find he had died here on this continent. Apparently he had returned to us, which pains us even more. <br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:47:52 2001] You say, 'where has he returned?'<br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:47:53 2001] Oglard says 'His body was found in the Eastern Wastes, spears of Krom Zek make protruding from his side and chest.' The wurm pauses for a moment to sigh heavily. He continues, sorrow on his voice, 'We believe......we hope, one of the sentient races witnessed his murder. Chances are slim to nil. But perhaps one of those.....Caldoin? Or something? Found him and recorded his name. Will you investigate this for us Keyno ? <br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:48:39 2001] You say, 'yes I will investigate this for you'<br />
<br />
[Tue May 08 20:48:40 2001] Oglard says 'We are greatful for your service to us. We know you have little interest in our affairs, yet you risk your life to aid us. Once you find his name, then perhaps we can find a way to release his restless spirit. If you do this, you will be rewarded an item of your choice from our hoard of treasure. Begin with.....whatever they call themselves. The Giants refer to them as iron pellets. Return to me proof of his name and he will be remembered. <br />
<br />
<br />
        PART II – THURGADIN A<br />
<br />
Loremaster Sarl can be found In ThrugA at the Statue room across the way from the Icewell zone.<br />
<br />
[Wed May 09 17:50:52 2001] You say, 'Can you tell me the name of a slain dragon'<br />
[Wed May 09 17:50:52 2001] Loremaster Sarl says 'The name of Dragon you say? One that was slain? Hmmm, sounds interesting. Like I said, we've had little contact with Dragons, but I vaguely recall an ancient legend about a slain dragon and one of our people meeting. Follow me to the Library and we'll talk along the way. <br />
<br />
And so we start walking to the library.. he buffs everything he sees along the way...<br />
<br />
[Wed May 09 17:52:54 2001] Loremaster Sarl says 'There are only a few myths we've recorded havin to do with Dragons, many less legends. There's a story of an ancestor of the Dain ridin a 'Wurm' into battle against Giants. A Wurm be a lesser form of a Dragon, not able to use magic or fly, but still just as mean. There's another story, more recent, about a pair a Coldain that rampaged through the countryside along side a magical sea turtle, undoing evil and saving this and that. Heheh, more likely a drunken wive's tale. <br />
<br />
[Wed May 09 17:53:22 2001] Loremaster Sarl says 'Ye may not know this, but we didn't always make our home here in Thurgadin. Centuries ago we lived deep down in the ground, close to Brell. That was our first home after we became stranded on this chunk of ice. We lived there peacefully for a while, until the Giant kin found us. They drove us out, though we didn't leave without a fight. This statue coming up here is of a hero that sacrificed his life in that battle to bring a great cavern down on the heads of many o those giants. <br />
<br />
[Wed May 09 17:54:04 2001] Loremaster Sarl says 'I brung up our old home o Froststone because we had many books and tablets that were lost when we were forced to flee. We had a long history during our peaceful time there, much of it is lost to us now. Still, we were able to save a few slim volumes. I'm thinkin we may find yer answer in o those old recordings. We'll see.........Ahhh, here we are. Remember to keep yer voice down, it is a library ye know. <br />
<br />
[Wed May 09 17:54:57 2001] Loremaster Sarl says 'Ok, here we are. Let me see.' Sarl runs a finger along the book labels searching for a paticular volume... <br />
<br />
[Wed May 09 17:55:41 2001] Loremaster Sarl says 'Do ye know anythin about this dragon? Ye need his name right? Some o these older ones are organized in strange ways. I love me fore fathers, but they made some funny kinda rules. Do you know what color this dragon was? <br />
<br />
And since I do not know the color of the dragon.. I start to name dragon colors. Red, Green, Blue, <br />
<br />
[Wed May 09 17:55:53 2001] You say, 'Black'<br />
[Wed May 09 17:55:53 2001] Loremaster Sarl says 'Excellent, I know what we're lookin fer now.<br />
<br />
As soon as you say &quot;Black&quot; he will despawn and respawn in the library.  So, if you know where the library is, simply ask him about the name of a slain dragon, and then say &quot;Black.&quot;  He will pop in the library.  Just run over to him and hand him 50pp and he will give you the book.<br />
<br />
[Wed May 09 21:04:32 2001] Lorekeeper Sarl says 'Ah hah! Here it is! Let's see here..Yes, I remember now. This is the story o Burdael. Ill lend ya the book, but it'll cost ya 50 platinum.<br />
<br />
<br />
        PART III – FROSTONE IN CRYSTAL CAVERNS<br />
<br />
Gave the book to Historian Baenek in Frostone.<br />
<br />
Historian Baenek says 'You found one of our lost tomes! A lost volume of the Book of Grudges, quite a find. Oh dear Brell! This evidence proves that the legend of Burdael is true! Thank you Metopious. And now I suppose you wish to meet his ghostly form. I have snesed him from time to time. I will call to him now. Go and wait for him in the lower halls. His spirit sometimes calls to me from where the fearsome Stalag Terrors lair. Be warry though, unlife may have twisted his mind beyond reason.&quot;<br />
Your faction standing with the CitizensOfFroststone got better.<br />
<br />
He(Burdael) spawned in the back corner of the stalagterror area, blue to 60 weilding a dwarven axe and with SK pet.. spoke phrases in an unknown tongue, but when repeatedly hailed, replied with exactly the same text, meaning its not a normally randomly scrambled language. the two bracketed words were &quot;Yiond&quot; which triggered more gibberish, and &quot;furysve&quot; which he didnt respond to. despawned at about 5 mins. I'm excellent in Dwarven, Dragon and Elder Dragon fyi, likely its just rantings of a madman, but Yiond was mysteriously capitallized, likely thats our next lead. <br />
<br />
ok, so.. I waited an hour for the historian to respawn and killed the ghost, he dropped a sword, nothing special, but when ID'd.. <br />
<br />
IDs as : Remember, Garzicor.<br />
<br />
<br />
        PART IV – SKYSHRINE<br />
<br />
Give the axe, Onyxbrand, to Oglard in Skyshrine.  MAKE SURE you have an open inventory slot.<br />
<br />
[Wed May 30 18:54:56 2001] Oglard examines the axe closely. The Wurm's eyes widen as he makes out the name of Garzicor and immediately raises his head to the ceiling, letting out a howl of emotional pain. Your bones shake with the screach, an image of a man in the midst of a rain of his own child's blood comes to mind, the agony is so great. Out of breath, Oglard drops his head and focuses his attention back to you, barely able to hold himself up. He places an urn before you and says, 'You must find his corpse. Find his burial site and summon Garzicor's spirit by speaking your remembrance of him. Speak to him and find out all you can. Return to me with 2 pieces of his corpse combined in that urn. Help us Castrinas , you MUST!' <br />
[Wed May 30 18:54:56 2001] Your faction standing with ClawsofVeeshan got better.<br />
[Wed May 30 18:54:56 2001] Your faction standing with Yelinak got better.<br />
[Wed May 30 18:54:56 2001] Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
        PART V – DRAGON NECROPOLIS<br />
<br />
Say &quot;Remember, Garzicor&quot; at (+1500, +1100) right past the door to the paebla area, right under a giant dragon skull in the wall, with bones all around. <br />
<br />
This will spawn a dialog:<br />
<br />
Help<br />
Veeshan waits<br />
Must have revenge<br />
Kromzek Must die<br />
Must spill blood<br />
Vengeance!<br />
Home!<br />
Vengeance!<br />
Home!<br />
I am one but two<br />
I am sorry<br />
<br />
As soon as the words &quot;I am sorry&quot; appear, 2 bags spawn on the ground, one dragon skin, and one dragon bone powder of some sort.  Place them in the urn and combine them.  Note it is recommended you have the urn when you go to DN, as the two pieces are no rent.<br />
<br />
<br />
        PART VI – SKYSHRINE<br />
<br />
Give the combined urn to Oglard.  He tells you to go give the urn to Eldriaks Fe'dhar. Note the urn you get back is NOT the same one as you gave to him.<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:32:23 2001] Eldriaks Fe’Dhar says ‘Hmm?  What’s this?  Oh! You are the High Elf who has been helping us with the nameless one.  Well, not so nameless anymore.  A part of Garzicor clings to this world, eager to wreak vengeance upon the giants who murdered him.  We’ve decided a weapon must be constructed, and the restless spirit of Garzicor must be bound to it.  You must be the one to construct this weapon.  This dust must be used in the forging of the weapon’s blade.  Are you a master smith Torlan?<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:32:23 2001] You say, 'no, I am not a master smith'<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:32:23 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'You must be the one to forge the weapon, Torlan . Go and learn the art of the smith. Return only when you are a master and tell me you are ready. I will then tell you what must be done. <br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:32:23 2001] You say, ‘yes, I am a master smith’<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:32:23 2001]  Eldriaks Fe’Dhar says ‘Good.  The weapon is extremely complicated to construct, your skills will be tested perhaps beyond your abilities.  The weapon is known as a Naginata.  You need not be proficient in its use to build it.  The Naginata is constructed of four major parts.  The shaft, the blade, the fittings, and the hilt, or tsuba.  No ordinary materials can hope to bind the dragons spirit.  Special materials must be found.<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:46:14 2001] You say, 'how do I make the shaft'<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:46:14 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The shaft must be strong enough to withstand the effects of the spirit’s presence, yet flexible enough to be wielded properly.  Of the few dragons that returned to us from the Ring of Scale, some brough back knowledge of a type of wood that may be sufficient.  It is known as bronzewood.  One can find it amidst one of the forests on the continent of Kunark.  I am sure it is being used by one of the sentient races there.<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:46:14 2001] You say, 'how do I make the fittings'<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:46:14 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The fittings are the most important part.  The spirit itself will be held there partially.  We’ll discuss this later, when you have all the other pieces in your possesion.<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:46:14 2001] You say, 'how do I make the hilt'<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:46:14 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The tsuba is where most of the enchanment will lie. It must be forged seperately of another ore created to be the bane of the dragon. It is called chronium and was developed by the Kromzek with the aid of their blood-thirsty @#%$. You must forge the ore into a plate and then find a craftsman with the skill to carve a detailed mandala of draconic binding into it. This mandala will hold arcane power and restrain the spirit from destroying the weapon. <br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:46:54 2001] You say, 'what chronium'<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:46:54 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'Chronium is a sacred ore used only by the higher ranked priests of Rallos Zek. You may be able to find some in the city of the Kromzek, Kael Drakkel. Perhaps in one of their temples. Forging it into a plate is simple. Heat the ore in a forge and shape it with a Forging Hammer, then temper it with a Flask of Water. <br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:46:54 2001] You say, 'how do I make the blade'<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:46:54 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The blade will be the most difficult piece for you to build.  First of all, no mundane ore will do.  Long ago, Veeshan sent a gift to us in the form of a meteor.  This meteor holds the ore you must build the blade with.  Once you have the ore, follow the instructions in this book and forge the blade.  Don’t forget, when melting the ore, use the bone dust I gave you.<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:48:08 2001] You say, 'what a craftsman'<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:48:08 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'Since the mandala is so detailed, only a craftsman trained specifically in these matters will do. I'm sure you're a fine smith but an adventurer like yourself wouldn't have time to fully master the skill needed to create the tsuba. Find one whose entire life is the art of creating these types of weapons. The craftsman will need a sketch of the mandala as well as the plate of chronium. <br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:49:56 2001] You say, 'what mandala'<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:49:56 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The type of mandala we need is a diagram laced with powerful arcane enchantment. You'll need to find a sketch of the correct mandala for the craftsman to go by as he carves it into the chronium plate. There is one place you may be able to find a sketch of a mandala powerful enough to bind Garzicor. <br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:50:39 2001] You say, 'where is the place?'<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 28 10:50:39 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The ones that returned to us from the Ring of Scale told us of the Sarnak. These are hybrids of dragons and a sentient lizard race known as the Iksar. Whoever created them had to bind a dragon to his will or restrain it at some point. Perhaps this being or one of his brood still has a recording of the mandala. Once you have the Tsuba, Blade, and Shaft, return here and show them to me. I will then explain what must be done next.<br />
<br />
BOOK INSTRUCTIONS<br />
<br />
Only a master smith may make the blade.<br />
<br />
Once the ore is found, it must be broken into 2 portions with a forging hammer and a smithing chisel.<br />
<br />
First you must form the core of the blade.  Take one portion of the starmetal and apply the bone dust in the forge.  Then, with a hammer and chisel, fold the block of ore.  You must repeat this 5 times to homogenize the steel.  After the 5th folk, take the hammer to the ore and shape the core into a curved blade.<br />
<br />
Now for the “skin” of the blade.  Apply the remaining bone dust to the last portion of starmetal.  Fold this block of ore, as with the core, 10 times with the hammer and chisel.  This will be the most difficult and time consuming steps.  After the 10th fold block, apply the skin to the core with the hammer [and chisel].  The last step in the forging process is taking the whole blade and shaping it into a suitable naginata blade .<br />
<br />
The last major step is the tempering of the blade.  This includes a mixture of clay and water for the differential tempering process.  Combine a small block of clay with a flask of water at the potter’s wheel.  Then take the clay and apply it to the blade at the wheel as well, leaving the edge of it exposed.  Allow it to dry.  The last step is to heat the clay covered blade in the forge, and then plunge it into a fluid to temper.  In this case, a special fluid must be found.  In the mountains of Kunark one can find a very caustic type of mist that freezes and collects at high altitudes.  Find a portion of this ice and use it for the tempering.  Good luck.<br />
<br />
Be sure you put the forging hammer to the 'raw blade' one final time.  Be careful though, this step was NOT TRIVIAL at 180.  Then you can apply the clay. <br />
<br />
For the clay part, I suggest getting your pottery up to 128, which is easily done in the better part of two hours in NFP.  Just make unfired small bowls, mixing bowls, etc until you get to 128.  You need not fire them to increase your skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
[b]        PART VII – GATHERING COMPONENTS<br />
<br />
Bronzewood: Found on a rare spawn, A giant carpenter, which spawns in the giant fort in BW.  Simply kill the two mobs in the only hut where two giants spawn, and Carpenter Grundo will eventually pop.  He does not hold the staff, but you loot it off his corpse. There are some reports that any of the giants inside the fort are his PHs, but all confirmed sightings are inside the fort, in the 2 giant hut.<br />
<br />
Starmetal (meterorite ore): Found on Cliff golems in Overthere.  Not too difficult, they require one group.  Be sure you have a druid to kite around the Dragoons if they add.<br />
<br />
Chronium ore: Found on Armor of Zek in kael, next to the Vindicator. Not only must the Vindicator be killed or already dead for this, but you may have to deal with lvl 63+ Giants that hang out by the statue. The Statue of Rallos Zek not being up makes it a bit easier to pull the Armors, and a monk is highly recommended. Note, if your guild is killing the statue regularly, then you already are getting Armor of Zeks, as a few are usually pulled before the Statue.<br />
<br />
Mist that freezes: Found in Frontier mountains, at -260, -297 on the top of a mountain, called gray colored ice.<br />
<br />
Mandala of Draconic Binding: Ground spawn in the east wing in the room with four alcoves, one farther in to the left on the coffin. <br />
<br />
Forging the chromium ore into a plate is simple. Heat the ore in a forge and shape it with a Forging Hammer, then temper it with a Flask of Water. The chronium plate combine was trivial at 118 smithing, so was the INITIAL splitting of the ore. The folding of the core (5x) was not trivial at 118, was at 192.  The folding of the core and the blade are the most diffiuclt parts.  Some folks have reported up to 9 attempts before finally succeeding in the blade.<br />
<br />
Koajin in the Warrens is the craftsperson.  He said that he needs a special set of tools and to bring them here along with a suitable plate of metal and a sketch of the tsuba's design, then he can construct the tsuba.  The key phrase is &quot;I need your help.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The toolset is obtained from an innkeeper (Taralani Rahnta) in Paineel.  He tends a bar with some dancing skeletons playing instruments, and you need to hail him and give him 1000pp to get the toolset.  However, the set is NOT lore and NOT no drop, so you can make a level 1 erudite and get the toolset easily.<br />
<br />
Give Koajin the mandela, the toolkit (its a container), and the chromium plate and get tsuba in return.<br />
<br />
        PART VIII – SKYSHRINE<br />
<br />
Hand in the staff, blade, and tsuba to Eldriaks.<br />
<br />
Eldriaks Fe'Dhar takes the staff, blade, and tsuba and looks them over.  He says, 'Excellent craftsmanship.  These will make a fine weapon.  But one part remains to join all the pieces together.  That is the fittings.'  The wyvern then hands you the items back along with a vial of blood and says, 'This vial of blood will allow you to awaken Garzicor's spirit.<br />
<br />
You say, 'How do I awaken garzicor's spirit?<br />
<br />
Eldriaks Fe'Dhar says 'First you must awaken his spirit by speaking where you found his corpse. You must say exactly this:  &quot;You are one but two.  Your vengeance shall find a home.&quot;   Hopefully this will bring him to you.  You must hurry and splash the vial of Kromzek blood upon his ghostly form.  The taste of the blood will bring him fully into existence.  You must then do battle with him.  If you defeat him, you will have split his being which will be represented by two more shades.  Give them each a flawless diamond.  He will comply and choose these gems as a phylactery.  Once you have the dual phylactery, you need only combine them with the assembled naginata in a forge to create the Ethereal Bladed Naginata.  Bring me the weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
        PART IX – DRAGON NECROPOLIS<br />
<br />
Say the phrase, an invisible spirit spawns (just see name). If you mess this up, you have to wait about two hours before the phrase will spawn the spirit again (but of course if you lost the blood, it will take a lot longer).<br />
<br />
Give the spirit the blood and a construct looking dragon will spawn (Garzicor's Remains) and attack if you are lucky. I suggest you stand as close to the wall when you do the hand in, as this may help. Make   sure sure you check the name of the mob you are trading with as there is a mob with an empty name and another with a trigger name there also. As long as the name in the trade window is the sprit, they you will get the &quot;garzicor's remains rise and attack message&quot; and exp. If you are lucky, the construct will spawn and attack. There is something which causes the spawn to not occur, I speculate it is when you are standing on the spawn point, which is why I suggest you stand close to the wall, he will spawn right in the middle.<br />
<br />
Pull this back up the ramp to before the bend, so any kos to CoV people are away from his spawn point. Kill this, hits for 144 has an unmemorable AE, pretty weak. <br />
<br />
Then Garzicor's Wrath spawns where the remains died and is agro. This is a translucent looking dragon. He hits for 350ish and has a very strong AE fear, but is not hard for anyone that does zlandicar. Level 60s with 255 and better MR were still getting feared quite a bit, so expect half your people to be feared at all times. Also expect a few spider adds from the feared people.  There is a trap between the bend where you will be fighting and the spawn point, so try to have a rogue keeping it clear, but dont fight on it.<br />
<br />
Once he is dead, another translucent looking dragon will spawn on CoV faction at the original spot, where you said the phrase. This dragon is green, but WILL agro people who are kos, so make sure they are all back at the elbow. He hits for about nothing, so you can always trans out the idiots that agro him as long as they dont kill him (he is green). Give that a flawless diamond to get magical blackened diamond back. There will be another translucent dragon just past it, deeper down the tunnel, give that one another flawless diamond and get another magical diamond back. Both returned diamonds are NO DROP.<br />
<br />
        PART X – The Forge<br />
<br />
Go to a forge and combine the two diamonds with the assembled naginata. The result is an Etheral Bladed Naginata (did not identify it). Trivial at 192 smithing, several people have done this part at 175 smithing.<br />
<br />
        PART XI – Skyshrine<br />
<br />
Give the Naginata to Eldriaks Fe`Dhar:<br />
[Tue Jul 31 16:31:47 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'You have succeeded Iustus . Garzicor's spirit no longer calls to us from beyond. Now we ask that you do one more thing. You must wield this weapon against all giant kind to satiate Garzicor's thirst for vengeance. The Naginata has a special power against the Kromzek, they will fall easily before it. However, if you do not wish to, hand the weapon back to me and I'll give you an earring more worthy of a being of faith. If you are one of sorcerous powers, hand me the earring and Ill hand you a ring more suited to you. <br />
<br />
Cast Identify on the naginata he gives back (which looks identical)<br />
[Tue Jul 31 16:34:39 2001] Item Lore: Eldriaks Verified Naginata.<br />
<br />
Give naginata back to him:<br />
[Tue Jul 31 16:35:57 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'Tis sad to see that the weapon will not be wielded by it's maker, but here is your earring. Wear it well. <br />
<br />
Give him the earring:<br />
[Tue Jul 31 16:46:36 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'So you prefer the ring? Very well, may it serve you well Iustus . <br />
<br />
If you give him the ring he eats it and says nothing.<br />

<br />
I will also be the first to show my disatisfaction and disbelief towards VI and the people that put this quest together.<br />
<br />
DO YOU, the designers of this quest, honestly believe ANY MELEE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND ABOVE LEVEL 25 WOULD EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER make use of that piece of junk, known as the Naginata?<br />
<br />
With 2handed battle being so far broken in this game (I'm praying DaoC gets it right) that weapon NEVER be used by any self-respecting melee that is of the level to obtain said item.<br />
<br />
In short, GET A CLUE. Torch that thing, make the earring useable by all melee classes, tweak the ring so priests and casters can both use it; you then have two rewards that are somewhat worthy of the inane time requirements of Garzicor's Vengeance.<br />

Im hoping this was just an oversight and something gets patched in for us eventually. That just doesnt seem right to have every class but ROG/BRD get a reward for this when at the begning of the quest we were promied 'our pick from his treasute horde'.

The only redeeming quality of the ring was the Effect, then i saw it was only 5 Charges.  You should just up the AC on the earring, make it all/all and call it a day, or improve the stats on the ring and keep the Ring effect perma.  This quest should also be round robin, Eldriks shouldnt have eaten Iustus's Ring when he handed it in, he should have gotten the sword back.  I hope leaving bard and rogue off of all of these was a slight oversigt.  Anyway you look at this quest, the loot doesnt fit into the difficulty put into it.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you lost the end result however if he just ate it.  <br />
<br />
I got my blood back yesterday, at least I know the results now and I'll toss the earing on my cleric now instead of my monk.<br />
<br />
Furor is so right, I laughed out loud when I saw the sword stats, that thing is such a peice of @#%$ it's unbelievable. The only decent reward is the earing, and even that isn't worth the time I've spent on this quest. just look at all the crap you need to be able to do, in order to do this quest. What a load of crap.<br />

Sure, as 2HSers go, I've seen worse but the two-hander business is not exactly booming these days.  So, for kicks and giggles (thanks Vaslin) I thought I'd check the proc.  Perhaps it truely was good against Giants.  This is what I got:<br />
<br />
Garzicor's Vengeance<br />
DoT for 240 Hit Points in 8 ticks<br />
Decrease Attack by 20 (L1)<br />
Allowable Targets: All<br />
Resistance Check: Disease<br />
Spell Duration: 8 ticks (48 seconds)<br />
<br />
Big whoop.  Nothing particularily anti-Giant (a mini-Giantsbane would have been interesting at least) nor super powerful.  /boggle<br />

<br />
Well, my ranger's 32 and I use 2hs all the time. Indeed, most paladins and shadowknights like to use two-handers, and I prefer to use one when I'm not &quot;tanking&quot; (as a ranger, chortle). I do about as much damage but less aggro which equals a LIVE ranger. I don't expect it to change much as I level, especially if I get my hands on a Swarmcaller.<br />
<br />
Still, for all the effort in the quest I'd expect something a LITTLE more amazing... it's pretty nice and the effect isn't too shabby, but it's not superb. I'd still probably use it just 'cuz it's a naganata and unusual. The ring is kind of poo though... the effect is nice, but five charges? FEH.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iustus</div><div class="date">08-01-01, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At first, when testing, my duel partner reported the proc had a snare component. That alone would make it worth using for me, a paladin. But it didnt, that was a mistake.<br />
<br />
In general I think making a weapon a result for a quest like this is often a bad idea. Its too hard to compete with all of the good weapons out there. Either you end up with something which is 'the best' and then you have too many people doing the quest, or you end up with something that isnt, so no one will use it.<br />
<br />
No one that can duel wield will use any two handed weapon that exists, because once you get close to 60, the damage model and taunt model favor one handers too much.<br />
<br />
As far as comparing this weapon to other two handers. Well, I have a Primal Axe and Fiery Defender (epic) which both blow this away. Soon I hope to have a good paladin one hander from ToV, and then I never expect to go back to two handers (hurray!).<br />
<br />
But on to earrings, there are not many choices out there. I dont have an yelinak earring yet, nor anything from ToV, so the above earring, with exactly the above stats, would be something I would use all the time (except when I had to wear blue diamond for resists). <br />

Now instead of getting my brewing to 248 so i could make my own avalanche ale for my 9th ring, i instead have gotten blacksmithing over 200. I was sure as this quest progressed that only a select few would ever be able to complete it. I also figured that the reward would be something at least interesting considering all the work and time that would have to be put into it. How wonderful it is to basically be a couple steps from the point of spawning garzicor and discovering that there is no reason a rogue should even waste time to complete this quest.<br />
As of now i am done pursuing any new quests. I am done wasting my time on this part the game. <br />
<br />
The quest itself is written well, the storyline is fun and requires alot of traveling and alot of &quot;questing&quot; Unfortunatly i was not close to being the first done, and i am too damn curious to not read spoiler pages. I will of course keep all the items at this point, i assume it is because i have some hope that verant will give me a reason to keep doing this quest.<br />
Bah i am done posting about it.. it has just turned into a babbling post anyways.. just very disappointed /sigh<br />

You *knew* the first reward was going to be a 2hs Naginata, which you knew was going to suck due to this being EQ.  The earring is simply amazing, and the caster ring is pretty darn good.  Either would be worn by most people of the eligible classes.<br />
<br />
The only crappy part of the rewards is that there is nothing for bards/rogues.  I wouldn't be surprised to see them added to the earring next patch.<br />
<br />
Not saying that these items are the end all, be all items.  Just saying that IMO this is right around the level of reward people should have expected, given that the quest revolves around forging a 2hander.  In fact the earring exceeds what I would expect the quest reward for this to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Venture</div><div class="date">08-01-01, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to Copeland's, I would lose about 500 damage/minute if I used the Naginata over my current Spined Dragon Claws/Swiftwind.  That's all due to losing the haste though; if I give myself a Cloak of Flames the Naginata comes out about the same.  That relationship remains constant up to level 60 (I'm currently 55).<br />
<br />
OTOH, if I give myself Earthcaller or a similar high-quality 1H weapon to replace the Claws, I gain about 300+ damage/minute over the Naginata, even compensating for the haste loss.  (I wonder how much of that is coming from the Earthcaller proc, though, which almost never takes effect.  I should go muck with the weapons file to include a procless Earthcaller.)<br />
<br />
So I'd have to agree that the blade is really not worth the trip.  It's a hell of a quest though, and it's a real shame the rewards don't do it justice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iustus</div><div class="date">08-01-01, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember. To legitimately do this quest, you must kill the Vindicator, which is not a minor undertaking. I didnt get a good feel for how difficult the second (harder) dragon was. If I had to guess, I would say on the order of Klandicar, if a bit easier, making the Vindicator the hardest part from a difficultly to kill aspect. I think it is fair to say that any group doing the vindicator is going to have their epic weapons or better, and the weapon reward from this is clearly worse than epics.<br />
<br />
I really wish they would make the earring all/all, but I suspect the fix (assuming they do one) will be to just add rogues and bards to it.<br />
<br />
As far as knowing the Naginata would be one of the rewards, I would say I did not know that. From the script, I always assumed that the Naginata itself was not one of the rewards, but rather just a quest item like any other which you turned in for the real rewards. My guildmates were excited to see what new sword I would make, but I was always looking forward to the 'choice of treasures' part.<br />
<br />
Several people in my guild are looking into doing this quest for the earring, and one perhaps for the ring, but I dont see anyone wanting to do it for the naginata. Assuming we can multiquest it so I do all the smithing except the final combine. The question is whether the combine is likely with 175 skill. If that final combine has a low enough skill check, then doing it this way is feasible. If not, then I dont see many doing this quest.<br />

I thought it wouldn't with the bulk of the pieces being no drop... but then I remembered there is no portable forge (or is there?).  I assume you can't put No Drop items into a forge, or else you could transer No Drop items from one character to another.  Is the bone dust you get from handing in the Urn No Drop?  <br />
<br />
I started the quest but put it on the back burner when I heard about needing such a high blacksmithing skill.  I'd already invested excessive amounts of time and cash in trade skills going for the Shawl quest and I didn't have a huge desire to do that again.  I know a few smithers I could find to work on this quest with so if it is multiquestable, that's over half the time needed for the quest taken care of.</div></div><hr />

I do have to say I am disappointed in the reward for melee classes...a good friend monk of mine says that the gains on the earring for him are not significant enough to offset all the time he's put into smithing.  For a cleric like myself, the reward is fairly decent.<br />

I wouldn't risk doing the multiquest thing, i.e. have someone at 200+ skill forge the blade, and you make the final combine.  I am worried about that final combine myself, am only at 196 smithing :/  BTW, if you recall, the forge of the raw blade was NOT trivial at 180....<br />
<br />
Ninja Edit:  Quas, the part where you make the blade portion is multiquestable, because you need to hand in the staff and tsuba.  However you still need to combine the blade and teh diamonds in the forge. Edited by: Torlan at: 8/1/01 2:01:21 pm</div></div><hr />

I am 99% certain that this patch or next will include either an addition of classes on existing item or a new illusion mask for rog/brds. Heheh maybe an Ogre one?<br />
<br />
Why is it such a big deal that you fight in PoG anyways?  If it's armor, go get Thurg armor (It's virtually identical to PoG armor).  Or better yet, go get Kael or Skyshrine armor - much better stats.<br />
<br />
However even if you do hunt in PoG, you shouldn't have many problems in your home city.  Although Felwithe is difficult to traverse, I've never had a problem in Kelethin using the bank or using key trade skill vendors even though I have bottomed out PoG faction.  I assume that there are some NPCs that I would be KoS to in Kelethin but I haven't seen any yet, and as a rogue, I'm sure you could get around with no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Marisella</div><div class="date">08-01-01, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of, it was announced a few weeks ago that the reward probably would not be to your liking.<br />
<br />
Secondly, this quest is not that hard. Except for Garzicors spirit at the end, the entire quest can be done with a balanced group of level 55-60 people. This quest is NOT designed for people level 30. <br />
<br />
Thirdly, a lot of this quest can be multied and it is not at all impossible for a higher level to get all the components, smith the blade and everything and for a level 30-40 to get only say the bronzewood and multi everything else. Of course this hasn't been tried yet. Merely responding to someone's question earlier.<br />
<br />
My observation is such:  <br />
The entire quest is based around a weapon, so not to give a weapon would be totally contrary to the storyline.  Now, does the weapon need to be the be-all-end-all of weapons?  Of course not.  To suggest such is foolish.  This quest didn't have the difficulty of any epic weapon so to expect it to be better is just silly. <br />
Regarding bards and rogues, I am sure this is an oversight and that they will be included in a future patch.<br />
<br />
A final question.  Am I the only one who noticed this? <br />
Eldriaks fe`dahr says this :&quot;You must wield this weapon against all giant kind to satiate Garzicor's thirst for vengeance. The Naginata has a special power against the Kromzek, they will fall easily before it. <br />
<br />
Lustus mentioned he tested the weapon with his duel partner.  Has it been tested against Vindicator, Tormax etc? <br />
<br />
In conclusion<br />
Some people are very quick to denounce everything the day they hear of, see or get something new and they don't like the raw stats.  You never see them apologize for their mistakes but everyone knows what fools they've made out of themselves in the past.  There are too many examples to mention.  The quest is great. Even though the reward may not be the best, it certainly has a great story line.  And for those of us who are not only about having the best item in Norrath, being in the best guild in Norrath etc, quests like these are welcomed with open arms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is no use to make the blade and multi everything else.  If you bothered to read the walkthrough, you will see that you have to smith the assembled naginata with two imbued flawless diamonds after you kill Garzicor.  Your 30-40 would have to get his smithing up high to have a decent success rate on the final combine.<br />

I changed a couple things in the last patch. The entire quest should no longer be so difficult..... (removed question-answer section)<br />
<br />
Hopefully Kastrina or someone finishes it soon. The rewards probably wont be satisfactory to them after what they've gone through, but hopefully people will find them decent. And no we're not naming any items after anyone heheh.<br />

If this is the Marisella I think it to be, she is actually very close to the final fight, if not already there now.

Sounds to me as if she just has a great deal of resentment and anger built up because she's not at all pleased at the reward, and needed an outlet.  I found her post offensive, so I stomped on it.  I've been folliwing the quest since day one, and I found her trivializations of Iustus' work unacceptable.<br />
<br />

<br />
On second thought, making the ring rechargeable would probably be all it would take to make the ring worth the quest.<br />
<br />
I must say, I'm very disappointed that Bard's get nothing from this quest.. spent an incredible amount of time on the quest(and enjoyed most of it...) but now will never see it to it's end. Just wish we knew if rog/brd being left out was intentional or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahhh... yup...  The two I listed are the only two I took exception to that weren't already addressed.<br />
<br />
I started to reply to your comment about groups taking down Vindi, but saw that someone else had already posted a reply on that.  Also, thats something thats going to be server specific.  We have 2 guilds that can kill Vindi atm, but they only ever bother when going past him to Statue, so in our case, Vindi is up a considerable amount of time.  On other servers, Vindi might have the same life expectancy Zland/Kland/Cazic has on ours.  However, even on Terris, if another player had the ambition and the forces, they could move into Kael after a Statue raid and hit the Armours while Vindi/Statue were still absent.  And in that point, Marisella was correct, a couple groups could lay waste to the Armours.<br />
<br />
In regards to your comments about the multi-questing... not much to say there except I agree with you.  The hardest part of this quest is turning the Starmetal into the Blade, and given the final combine, the recipient of the reward would need the skill for the two gems + naginata anyway.<br />
<br />
But in any case, I don't think she was making any comment about the reward that would lead me to think she has a &quot;great deal of resentment and anger built up because she's not at all pleased at the reward&quot;.  If anything, I read her post to be upset at all the people flaming the quest giver because the rewards didn't live up to what they thought it should be.  She likes the quest as just the quest, the storyline and the fun of doing something not common.<br />

Edits added to bottom as I had to back to her original post to reread...<br />
<br />
&quot;Further, how can you cover her clear lack of understanding of the quest based on the statements she made?&quot;<br />
<br />
I just reread her post and saw no comments that either trivialized the work of others, or were clearing lacking in understanding.  She made valid points except about the ease of multi-questing this to a lower level character, and I'm willing to attribute that to an oversight on her part, forgetting the final combine.  However, you COULD still do as she described, assuming that low level character has put the time into smithing as the gather of the components did.<br />
<br />
Now, if you took her comment that this quest really wasn't that hard as trivializing the work of others.. I don't know what to say.  It's certainly a tough quest, but really not that hard.  Lets list:<br />
<br />
Book - solo<br />
Axe - 1 group<br />
Dragon Remains - solo<br />
Grey Ice - solo<br />
Star Metal - 1 group<br />
Bronzewood staff - solo to 1 group<br />
Chronium Ore - 1-2 groups given that Statue/Vindi are dead, or solo if you make arrangements with a Kael aligned guild that does Statue anyway.<br />
Mandella - 1 group<br />
Tools - solo<br />
Flawless Diamonds - 1 group (or buy in EC)<br />
Garzicor - several groups, and she mentioned this.<br />
<br />
I hope you don't think I'm trivializing this as well, but when you put what each part takes in perspective, which can only be done after the efforts of others, its not that tough a quest and certainly doable by others than those that belong to the top guilds on a server, which is all she was pointing out, and to those players, these rewards could be extremely nice.

That is a pretty nice earring. I don't really think its worth the effort put into the quest though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Marisella</div><div class="date">08-11-01, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ladas : Thank you for so clearly understanding my post.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Torlan :  I think you did clearly misunderstand it.  One point that was left out in Ladas' admirable defense is this:<br />
<br />
I said this :<br />
Thirdly, a lot of this quest can be multied and it is not at all impossible for a higher level to get all the components, smith the blade and everything and for a level 30-40 to get only say the bronzewood and multi everything else. Of course this hasn't been tried yet. Merely responding to someone's question earlier.<br />
<br />
You state:<br />
It is no use to make the blade and multi everything else. If you bothered to read the walkthrough, you will see that you have to smith the assembled naginata with two imbued flawless diamonds after you kill Garzicor. Your 30-40 would have to get his smithing up high to have a decent success rate on the final combine.<br />
<br />
The point is that the lower level ONLY has to get a high smithing skill to do this quest.  Since just about everything can be multied.<br />
A level 30 character can get allied faction with CoV and be merely be present when Garzicor is killed, hand the flawless diamonds to the wraiths, get two phylacteries and combine those with that blade and s/he would have whatever reward it is that s/he was after.<br />
<br />
And regarding the rewards?  I am a druid so yes, I am elated with the result. <br />
<br />
Finally, it seems you really didn't do the quest, nor read the walkthrough carefully.  There are no imbued flawless diamonds involved and neither are diamonds needed for the final combine.  You've stated time and again in your post about my lack of reading the quest, where it's obvious that it's the reverse.  I reiterate a sentence in my closing paragrah:<br />
<br />
&quot;You never see them apologize for their mistakes but everyone knows what fools they've made out of themselves in the past. There are too many examples to mention. &quot;<br />
<br />
I'll add you to the list</div></div><hr />

Once Vindi dies you can invis all the way back to where the armors spawn and just fight them at their spots. They have ~26 min spawn time. They'll probably fix that invis bug thing, and I'm not sure if the guardians see invis because I never went back there before. However, with Vindi down just fight your way back there and you can sit and farm the armors. I'm thinking that if the Statue is dead you can most likely farm the armors even with Vindi up since you can invis past him and I doubt he'll aggro you in the back of the temple. Once again, this will probably change by the patch.</div></div><hr />

He spawns in the very back of the terrors area. There's a dead end room with 5 terrors in it. Clear them before you trigger the ghost. Once you get to the place where there are steps going down into 2 different tunnels, and a tunnel on your right leading up past the geonids to the zone, take the left path down the steps. That leads through to the dead end room of the terrors area.<br />
<br />
I really doubt you could solo the ghost, he's a SK, blue to 60. He has a LOT of hp. I'm a 60 shaman and I did him with a 54 enchanter and it was a real struggle. He outlasted 2 Turgur's Insects at 5 minutes each (died right after second one wore off). We got a lot of respawn terrors and the enchanter ran several of them up to the guards to get rid of them. Had to do a lot of root/dotting. I'd bring a healer with you (preferablly shaman) to do this. Wouldn't be so hard then.</div></div><hr />

No sure how i'd fix this, turn it into a 13/20 and drop the slow to 15% is my guess. <br />
<br />
The earring is nice, but for the effort 5ac sucks ass.  <br />
<br />
The ring is nice, cant really find much better on a caster ring.. the Mana Flare is one of those Whats the point kind of things, whats the point of having something that cant be recharged.<br />
<br />
This actually rivals some of the epic quests, yet each of the items have huge drawbacks that makes the quest undesirable to do... the 2hander because its a 2hander, the earring cause of the low ac, the Ring is actually nice, but the 5 charge thing is annoying.  They should change the effect from Mana Flare to something like Flowing Thought 1 or something... i mean this quest is damn hard and Dragon faction sucks enough ass as it is... could be one of the better rewards of being on the faction.  Bracer of Benevolence quest hasn't been nerfed, one of the nice perks to being on dragon faction, take that away and many less would be on dragon faction.  This quest is damn hard and the rewards dont fall in line completely to the difficulty and stress required.  <br />

I hope verant fixes it, would be cool to see a lot more people doing it.  I plan on doing it for the earring, wish it weren't a gimpy 5ac tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I orginally saw this weapon on Allakhazams website and dedcided to get some more info on it.  None of the zones mentioned on Alla's spoiler have an area that I know of like the one noted above.  Is the Mandala found somewhere other than the mentioned zones? (i.e. SS, Kael, BW, CC, DN, FM, OT, Thurg and Warrens)  Perhaps Chardok or HS?  Any tips...<br />

[Thu Jun 28 10:49:56 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The type of mandala we need is a diagram laced with powerful arcane enchantment. You'll need to find a sketch of the correct mandala for the craftsman to go by as he carves it into the chronium plate. There is one place you may be able to find a sketch of a mandala powerful enough to bind Garzicor. <br />

[Thu Jun 28 10:50:39 2001] Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The ones that returned to us from the Ring of Scale told us of the Sarnak. These are hybrids of dragons and a sentient lizard race known as the Iksar. Whoever created them had to bind a dragon to his will or restrain it at some point. Perhaps this being or one of his brood still has a recording of the mandala. Once you have the Tsuba, Blade, and Shaft, return here and show them to me. I will then explain what must be done next.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sheathed</div><div class="date">09-26-01, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as far as quests go, I think this is one of the best ones. Ring quest is a lot of fun and this one appears to be to.<br />
<br />
However, I think it is truly fair to say that the sword reward is a bit pathetic. as both a 59 warrior (as well as a 52 rogue), I'm never really gonna use 2hs, even after the 2hs changes go in. Even if the damage becomes comparable, why woul I wield 1 weapon with 1 proc, when I could wield two for twice the taunt? (well, more than twice, more swings = more procs).<br />
<br />
I think this quest *should* give out a reward that people are at least likely to use for a while till they get a good upgrade... i.e. a weapon off statue, or better. I don't think it's unfair to expect the reward to be one step below that sort of MoB handout. Hell it's even below the 40dmg cap, so you don't even get that bonus.<br />
<br />
As to the other two rewards. Well, I'd use the earring, there really aren't that many good earrings out there. Reasonably decent and any at the level required to do this would appreciate the sta, hp and mana.<br />
<br />
The ring to me seems a reasonably decent ring too. Not too up on the caster gear tho.<br />
<br />
I guess IMHO, the earring should be available to more classes, give the people who have put time and effort into this quest something reasonably ok for a reward. Doesn't have to be uber, but the rewards are too strictly defined. Doesn't allow for enough flexibility.<br />

Some hot spots for silks is feerott, all the jungle spiderlings and spiders drop spiderling silks.  Also since Stonebrunt opened up that is the place to be for pelts.  No more ruined pelts, it seems there they have been replaced with LQ pelts.  I went there with my twink to explore there, found this out and became a slaughter of all cats!  Also to make things easier, if you can sow or something or even small buffs...tell the noobie ogres that you will buff them for all their silks.  I did that a few times worked very well.  As another alternative head over to EC and WC and auction for LQ, MQ, and HQ pelts of any type.  You can also auction for the silks in EC.  Also make sure you check vendors.</div></div><hr />

On a different note, I had my blood eaten.  Luckily the GM was nice enough to give it back.  He went through it and did the quest with me there, it worked fine.

<br />
There is an invisible mob that spawns right where the ghostly presence shows up.  When you turn in your blood, double check the name on the trade window, because a few times when i had the window up there was no mob name listed.  But when i moved around behind the ghost his name popped up in my trade window.  I'm guessing i just handed the vial to the blank mob the first time around.  As for the fight its a 3 or 4 group deal, Garzicor isn't hard (double 350's) but he's real fat and his fear is nasty even with bigtime mr.<br />

I would just keep doing /feedbacks if you want a rogue/bard rewards, sounds like an oversight to me, but you never know since the quest text doesn't mention anything that defines a rogue or bard, but they can always change quest texts if enough people complain.<br />

And even if it was 32/37 that is still shocking for a quest that takes this amount of time to do. Not to mention that it's 2hs, not 1hs. Due to the pre-defined nature of the rewards for this quest (i.e. each class can only use one of the rewards... well, cept bards and rogues, they can't use any of them) the items should be worth using.<br />

37/40 with those stats might be worth dong now. Though, it'll still be a toy, it'll be a usable toy</div></div><hr />

  Dont know if anyone has answered your question about the diamonds but I have almost completed the quest now, just need Chromium from Kael.  From my understanding the Flawless Diamonds are never used in the construction of the weapon, its the Black Diamonds you get after killing the 2 dragons and handing them the Flawless Diamonds that use you use in the final combine.  The Flawless Diamonds act as fittings for the weapon and where the primary bulk of the dragons spirit is held, but not until after you have enclosed the spirit within them.  Good luck!<br />

Thanks for your rpsonse.  I understand that the final combine uses the two diamonds gotten once you have spawned and killed the wraith.<br />
<br />
My concern is that the walktrhough says to combine the two gems with the 'assembled naginata'.  <br />
<br />
Eldriaks texts says he gives you back the unassembled pieces (blade, tsuba and staff).<br />

There are conflicting reports of what the trivial is for all combines.<br />

Some say 190+ some say in the 180s, yet another says everything is trivial at 175.<br />

The core was all trival at 175, but then I failed on the 2nd of 10 folds of the blade skin.  So tried again at 192, everything was trival and no fails.  As far as assembly of the weapon, to the best of knowledge you combine all the pieces; blade, staff, tsuba, and the fittings together.  Eldriak tells you after you hand him the staff, tsuba and blade, that one part remains to join the pieces together and that is the fittings.  I have still not gotten over to hand him the pieces, but I am quite sure you only combine the 5 items at the very end.<br />

<br />
After last battle and handing in the 2 flawless diamond, you will get 2 items in return, combine these and the naginata in a forge. Trivial at 178 skill.<br />
<br />
The result of the combine is Ethereal Bladed Naginata.<br />
<br />
If you give this Naginata to Eldriaks you will get another back, give to him again for the earring, give him the earring for the ring.<br />

<br />
Thus the ring would actually become a nice item, as you could use it in a pinch, but know that all you have to do is go back to skyshrine to get it recharged.</div></div><hr />
