I normally play an alt on tallon but she would'nt agree.<br />
<br />
she has a 7th level Rogue but its on my account and she wants to re-start the same character on her account so I told her about the Shanks on Vallon (she already knows Fricka) and she's agreed to play her rogue on htere with the possibility of joining the Shanks in the future.<br />
<br />
Probably will be a way off  before we're at any kind of decent level as we will still be concentratin on our mains.<br />
<br />
But if y'll have us then we will officially apply for membership in a while.<br />
<br />
Only problem is I have to play the Shammy as support to her Rogue (other way round on Luclin)<br />
<br />
Any way our names are<br />

started the characters last night and will hopefully spend a few hours on them over the weekend.<br />
<br />
I did notice a big difference to playing in Halas and Everfrost compared to West Freeport! <br />
Whats up are the other races too afraid of the Barbs to venture that far North on Vallon?<br />

<br />
Ah but being rogues and rogues at heart we are everywhere and nowhere so our enemies have no particular need to fear us in Everfrost.  In fact it may be time for a gathering at home soon.<br />
<br />
I'll keep an eye out for both of ye.<br />
<br />
When the time is right post in our Mead Hall (we don't have a level limit requirement by the way)...it's also a good place to discuss server specific things.<br />

<br />
I think we'll mostly be playing our mains of course but the Shanks seems such a close knit community we would be very proud to add our names when the time comes.<br />
Let us know when the next contest of Blood occurs it seems to be something quite special that we would love to see.<br />
<br />
I mentioned this to my RL friend who got us into EQ an plays on Tallon and Luclin and though you dont have a prescence on Tallon he has still heard of your awesome reputation and was dead impressed when I mentioned we knew you lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">05-05-01, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, that is funny!  I know we're rather infamous on Vallon Zek, but...  Is your friend a rogue?  Maybe he heard of me from the Safehouse?<br />
<br />
Aye I'll try to add you to an email list about the Contest of Blood...we welcome human team observers.  It is much more fun to participate of course  <br />
<br />
I think I'll pop into Vallon now on the off chance that ye guys are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Stytch Yapgud</div><div class="date">05-05-01, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn if I'd known.<br />
<br />
No he plays casters mainly, when we group (on luclin) he usually plays his shammy barb : Ironlemming.<br />
Love his name.<br />
<br />
He plays mainly a druid (notice not Droooood) on Tallon (an a ench as his alt) but he has still heard of ye.(guild not u personally) though he has started readibn the safehouse cos I told him about it.<br />
Cant remeber his guilds name.<br />
<br />
Played me alt for the final time on Tallon tonight so I could give away what items I did gain in my poor 4 levels.<br />
<br />
made someone happy though as I had some nice jewlery my friend gave me from his ench with high jewlry skills.</div></div><hr />
