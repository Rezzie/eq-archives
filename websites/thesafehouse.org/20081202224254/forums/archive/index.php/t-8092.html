<br />
    While theses new poisons are from what i can understand equivalent to a self buff with 5 to 10 charges (shammie potion like) lasting over periods of 10 miutes to 15 minutes and the effect being added poison proc based on dex, i need to know the followin:<br />
<br />
1- Is the new pop poison stackable on the blade if different: <br />
     Exemple, can i stack a pop poison decreasing movemment with a pop DD poison. Will it gives me 2 buffs-like effect or the second will overwrite the first?<br />
<br />
2- Is the OLD poisons can be stacked with a POP poison so you can land the initial one use effect poison plus still benefit of the buff like poison? (i know old poisons dont stack with another old poison)<br />
<br />
3- IS there a way now to make OLD poisons as 5 or 10 charges uses bottle or its only for pop poisons?<br />
<br />
<br />
Clear answers to theses questions will decide for me if i am even buying pop or coming back to PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was using the new poisons quite a bit over the week end.  You can cast them on while fighting.  I got only a couple of interrupts if I would move but with the 2 second cast time, was not a big problem.  So, You can use an &quot;old style poison&quot; as the first attack, then click apply your advanced buff after the old one fires.<br />
<br />
Question of my own... I see they have a recommended level of 46 listed.  Has anyone tried giving the posions to a truely young rogue?<br />

Im still pissed off that you need to be mainly lvl 59 - 60 in order to combine the poisons into multi-charge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underdawg Darogue</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sad truth of the matter is that these poisons require 250 skill and are not really even trivial then. I still fail alot of Bite of the shissar at 250 with the 5% of the seal. A lower end rogue might be able to use them but complaining that you have to be 59+ to combine is moot cause you have to be 59+ to even make without overcostly failures.</div></div><hr />

The Bixie Sting overwrote the Spine Bruiser.  I tried using another Spine Bruiser then, but got &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot;.  It did cost me a charge.  My guess is that we can only have one proc-poison active at a time.<br />
<br />
My guess is that we will be able to use an old one-shot poison and a proc poison at the same time, but I haven't tried it yet.<br />

<br />
Im able to make my own advanced poison vials with pottery which makes them cheaper then sealed vials.  At 220 skill I can make Bixie sting all day if I wanted too.  <br />
<br />
My big issue is that no matter how many Poisons I make, only being lvl 54 restricts my ability to make chargeable poisons.  Non-stacking poisons is what sucks with the old poisons, and it still sucks with the new poisons.  Why make the fix for one of poisons biggest problems (stackability) only available for those who are lvl 59+.  Thats BS in my opinion, and I think people should feedback SOE about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barrister</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1- No. Can have only one poison &quot;buff&quot; up at a time.<br />
<br />
2- Yes. You can have a new poison &quot;buff&quot; up, and use an old poison on your blade. (I personally really like this.)<br />
<br />
3- No. As far as we know only the new poisons can be into made mutli-doses. For years, Verant has said with the way the old poisons were implimented, it was simply impossible. They havent said otherwise so far. Cloauk N'Dger<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Biguss</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also what proc buffs stack with our poisons...<br />
<br />
<br />
say if we got the Call of fire gloves from VT would those stack as well?<br />
<br />
Anyone confirm this plz lemme know thnx :) &amp;lt;img src=&quot;http://www.users.qwest.net/~njcogswell/bigusssig.jpg&quot;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Makkil</div><div class="date">10-30-02, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you need 250 skill to make the stackable poisons.  Nothing prevents you from buying/borrowing a poison from a higher level Rogue.  It is probably more cost efficient.  I spent many Kpp getting to 250.   Additionally it was many Kpp to get the vial, plus the time to farm the stuff for the seal.<br />

Pay and go stab something.<br />
