A long time ago, in this very galaxy... I made a promise to you all that you would be the first to know when the first force sensitive slot was unlocked.<br />

<br />
It is my privilege to announce that this monumental event has happened today.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Now I’m not going to give more details on the character at this time and chances are they probably aren’t going to give themselves away (though I could be mistaken on that), so you may have to take my word on it for now.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We will give some more information about the first Jedi (like which server) but given that this happened right before the weekend and I need to discuss it with LucasArts, don’t expect a more formal announcement until next week.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I can tell you that we will likely see a couple dozen more Jedi over the weekend.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
May the Force be with you first few (you are going to need it...) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">11-08-03, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">problem is the only challange left in the game is to be a jedi for alot of people. its not a challange game wise,just a matter of investing alot of time doing the quests/ mastering whatever classses /skills you need.<br />
<br />
for those of us playing 5-10 hours a week,its pointless to attempt being a jedi. but at the same time theres no other challanges left in the game. pve combat is a joke,the AI is so poor it presents no effort to anyone,except pure novice players. pvp combat is in the same boat,lack of any kind of strategy beyond what weapon/and speical attacks to use. <br />
<br />
hell in the end,being a jedi isnt even a challange except in terms of time invested,and the only intersting thing about it is its you against the server,because your auto flagged with everyone as a potential enemy.<br />
<br />
after playing casually for 3 months,ive basically done everything possible in the game outside of being a jedi. ive crafted,ive fought every major mob in the game. there is 0% left,the only thing that has kept me playing is a few old guild mates who are basicaly gone now. <br />
<br />
guess i would say in the end,swg was a failure, might be worth playing in a year,if they get a decent flight sim going,whre i can actually fight other people.</div></div><hr />

One long grind.<br />
No storyline.<br />
No quests.<br />
No NPC's from the movie.<br />
Unlock a character that can only die 3 times.<br />
Work up and now you can die five times.<br />
Then when you reach the death limits start grinding up the jedi again. <br />
 <br />
 When you dig my grave, make it shallow so that I can feel the rain<br />

<br />
But they are now the most famous player in SWG.  They are the *first* one to unlock the force sensitive slot.  One downside, apparently that player is a complete and total asshat.<br />
<br />
She (I mean he, the 32 year old German male) is a pain in the ass, even before the force slot was opened.  It figures, asshats have all the luck it seems.</div></div><hr />

Great, thats probably right up there with the person who completed E.T. on the Atari in the shortest time.<br />
<br />
What a complete and utter dissapointment.  The whole, &quot;becoming a jedi will be different for each character so it can't be spoiled&quot; turns out to just be a big randomization of what classes you have to learn.  Wow.  I'm finished with this game. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">11-10-03, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't talking about the player, I was addressing the entire process involved in becoming a Jedi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">11-10-03, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">basically you have to master 3 classses,or come close to it.<br />
<br />
once you do that,you have to complete a random series of events,which will trigger your flag.<br />
<br />
the thing is,those events usually revolve around doing the same quests/monthly storyline quests that everyone else is doing.<br />
<br />
theres nothing origional about getting a jedi slot,its just a typical Sony/verant old style grind mentality. i imagine once there become a mass of jedi charecters on every server, that you will see sony/verant change it because to many jedi's exist.<br />
<br />
im not trying to bash SWG,i mean its no worse then any other online game to come out in the last few years. but its not any better either,and thats a dissapointment because with some effort it could have been the next EQ/UO etc.</div></div><hr />

The implementation sucked.<br />
<br />
Once I learned some details about the process of unlocking the slot, I decided that I won't play SWG... glad I didn't, because all I had heard turned out to be true... <br />

I saw it before it ended and was up around 2200 I think? I dont have a ebay account is that why it isnt showing me the final price?<br />
