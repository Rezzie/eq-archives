Do you think this is a outgrowth of the EQ raid mentality, or general powergame attitude, or do you agree?  <br />
   I think that as long as someone can do their job, and we all have fun, and the floor isn't covered in bodies its ok if the tank like to use a lot of hitting, the defender or controller are pure one powerset, ect.  I mean we are playing this to act our our childhood superhero fantasies right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telurinon</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's strictly a min/max power gamer mentality.  Those players honestly think that if you are not going for the absolute optimum build, you are useless.<br />
<br />
It took years of various GMs/DMs and fellow game players to beat that mentality out of me...and I still feel the urges.  One day at a time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hasn't been a problem for me.  I explore concepts, but keep them playable.  For example, I know the power of hover from one of my blasters, but my second blaster is based off L5R's Scorpion clan, so I'm going with stealth/leaping abilities.  Both playable, just different.  Do miss hover at times, but, well, when I solo with Shosuro Namuki, I do it by running around in circles.  I don't get meleed either way.<br />
<br />
Primary/secondary don't really matter, just means adjusting to what you can do.  For example, my usual group has a storm primary defender in it.  Not the best heal.  Yet the storm power's slows are such that I require less healing in that group than I would with an Empathy Defender.  I tank, defender ensures I live, mobs die, same result either way.<br />
<br />
Anyway, long as you can do what you are supposed to do, nothing else really matters.<br />
<br />
One exception to that...tanks without taunt or provoke;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I hate how the EQ playstyle kills the fun. Like when people insist on calling their super powers 'spells' (and they aren't a magic origin) :)<br />
<br />
I suppose it's inevitable with classes that fall so neatly into the nuker/crowd control/tanker/healer type categories. But I spec my character purely for my own enjoyment and character concept, even if the choices aren't the most practical.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that keeps happening to me is that i call enhancements &quot;augments&quot; when talking to my friend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda hard to min max in EQ since every class gets the same skills.  A 50 rogue is a 50 rogue, is a 50 rogue. <br />
<br />
That said games like DAOC and Shadowbane where you actually get skill choices (some being more powerful than others) I think have lead us to where we are today with charcter builders/planners and the min/max phenomenom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all!  People who use EQ lingo doesn't bother me one bit, and as far as the EQ mentality, well to be honest with you, that has made me snobbish for quite some time now anyways.  I've been playing pretty much exclusively with people I know, friends, guildies, family members, etc for a long time now simply because pick up groups have proven to be disasterous for my enjoyment too many times for me to count.  People I play with share the same mentality for a game that I do.  We play to have fun, not to be the most l33t, and overall, I have a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have left groups in disgust because of the groups eq playstyle.<br />
(huddle in a corner and wait. wait wait.   Then a bad pull that kills half the group)  <br />
<br />
But the eq playstyle has benefited me somewhat.  Being a unwanted rogue for so long, I have learned to never solo and always create a team.  I have no problem, loggin in and creating a group of 5 random people and kicking ass for the next few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah but now u can solo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyssa</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah but know u can solo!<br />
<br />
But that's moot if you don't enjoy soloing.  Frankly, if I were to solo, I'd much rather log off and watch TV.  I find it depressing to solo and not much fun at all.  I used to enjoy soloing in EQ at one point but after a while, it gets painfully boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was kind of meant as a joke/irony since he was so forced to group in eq it has changed his playstyle (you know the title of this thread) anyway let me rephrase:<br />
<br />
Every class can solo!!!! If you want to or not, that is your choice!!!!<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Every class gets in a group easily and it only takes minutes!!!!<br />
<br />
That should cover all the old bitchin and complaints in regards to: <br />
1.not being wanted by a group <br />
2.not being able to solo<br />
3.it taking 2 hours to find a group out of your 3 hour playtime window<br />
<br />
<br />
See now everyone is happy my job is done :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekoken</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like CoH for soloing.  Log in, blow off some steam for an hour and log out.  I don't see enough depth in the game history, story, or quest-wise to bother joining a team and playing every evening like in EQ.  It also is actually possible to be productive soloing, unlike a melee character in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but im a rogue and  i never got groups cause rogues were worthless,and i cant solo cause im a rogue:p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I enjoy being able to solo now. Something I was never able to do in EQ, unless I made a class that I didnt want to be. And thankfully, this game is no where near as addictive as EQ (at least not for me). EQ was almost consuming, with this, you can log on for an hour or two, kill some stuff, get a lvl, and have the rest of the night to do whatever you want hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly, sure you can play 24/7 hit the 40wall and get bored, but if your like me and have less time of late (reactivated gym membership) you can play it adhoc and have a good time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grouped with a Scrapper, who only wanted to single pull whenever possible.<br />
<br />
We went through 2 whole missions, and Every single time, He'd duck around a corner, target an enemy, Duck back around out of LOS, Teleport Foe, kill it. Repeat ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
This was on Clockworks that were blue to both of us, and I could probably take 2-3 solo, as long as there was only 1 LT among them. Only time I ever healed was in a bad pull, or a Boss Mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have appreciated a group using a technique like that last night. But only if the enemies are orange or beyond. I've got no problem wading into a few yellows or lower, especially if I were teamed with a healer like you. He had a golden opportunity he should have taken advantage of to play on the edge a little.</div></div><hr />

I've been lucky so far and all the tanks have been good about pounding on one or two of the more dangerous mobs until dead then switching, and the blasters and scrappers shred the mid lvl ranged attackers who can add up dmg in groups quick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I'll probably get in trouble for giving away &quot;the big end game strategy for mass experience,&quot; the way we do it when possible is to run door missions with a full group of 8 with at least 1 controller, one invuln tanker, and one fire tanker.  Rest of group can be any mix of damage dealers and buffers.  Group finds a handy corner and hides behind it.  Invuln tanker runs out and attracts the attention of as many bad guys as he can without dieing (20-30 not unheard of) and runs back to group.  Badguys bunch up at the corner like newbs.  Controller(s) lock them down, fire tank starts burning, scrappers and blasters take out the outlying minions then assist with lts and bosses.  Defenders heal and buff as needed.</div></div><hr />

Yes, thats sort of the problem. With a Healer, groups think &quot;I can just wade in and do anything I want, the Healer will keep me alive&quot;<br />

LMAO I so hear that. I'll join a group and we'll rip through things just fine, making awesome exp. Then everyone says &quot;we need harder stuff to kill&quot; and then things would always go downhill because the tank dies in 3 seconds and the people are getting one shot.<br />

(Ice/Stone Tanker) and he started in on how I had to reroll as some other tank combo.. don't even remember what it was he thought I should be. And also told me to get a new name.. WTF!! the Butterfly Hero is an awesome name! :p <br />
<br />
But that's the first time I've come across anything like that.</div></div><hr />
