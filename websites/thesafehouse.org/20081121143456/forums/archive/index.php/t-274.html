<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if someone could explain to me the different starting origins. I understand already that they set what origins you can use throughout the game, but what effect does this have on your character? I.E. if I choose an energy/energy blaster, would I get gimped from choosing a Technology origin (i'd imagine so since I don't use assault rifle or devices), or say picking a natural origin for a tanker and going stone/stone, etc.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't matter too much; It was going to be more extensive (certain costume designs origin-specific) but I think now about the only difference is where you'd buy your enhancements when you get past level 11 (and being able to use specific dropped enhancements that may be &quot;Mutant only&quot; or &quot;Magic only&quot;, etc.).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the drop rate of certain inspirations is different depending on the origin; they were going to, but it may have been removed as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah all right, thanks Ruccus.<br />
<br />
I've also got another question now too :p After reading Fedinfensor's guide, and understanding a little bit more each time, I realized he's only got the 1st and 2nd power pool power availability available (mwahaha). <br />
<br />
When you create your character, I see you must take 3 powers (2 from primary and 1 from secondary) and then you get more every other level. However at level 6 you can get powers from the ones listed at the end of the guide (Fitness, Flight, Teleport, etc.). So my question is thus: where do those powers fit in? Do i have sacrifice powers from my primary/secondary power pools to select those, or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I read through it again, and I see that at level 38 you would have all of your primary/secondary powers (9 in each set) and then 4 power choices left over until level 49.<br />
<br />
Does this mean that you can take 4 powers from those 2 alternate power pools (say Swift, Hurdle, Stamina from Fitness and then hover from Flight)? Or can you sacrifice primary/secondary powers to get more of the alternate powers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 40 you've got enough power slots to take everything from your primary and secondary lines, plus two pool powers. If you want more than two you have to give up something from your archetype powers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantom Rogue</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Origins have a bit of effect on yer choices.  Like dont go Fire and natural (natural fight Hellions, and they have better FR), Tech is Clocks (least for a while, and they dont like lightning), ect ect<br />
<br />
Some are better than others, but overall, i think they got pushed on the backburner, and they dont have as much of an influence as they might have intended upon design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure the options you get for the second set of titles (at 26) is dependant on what your origin is.  I haven't seen the lists though, so that might not be too big of a deal.<br />
<br />
Of course, Dual and Single Origin Enhancements are where it comes into play this most.  Also, from what I heard, DO and SO Enhancements of particular origins are more likely to drop off appropriate mobs.  For instance, Tech ones have a greater chance of dropping off of Clockworks while Magic ones have a greater chance of dropping off the Circle of Thorns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">basically Origin only effects who you will be buying your enhancers from, and who you are LIKELY to face on missions. <br />
<br />
The blurb about origin effecting which inspirations you would get was negated before teh first wave of beta ever began.</div></div><hr />
