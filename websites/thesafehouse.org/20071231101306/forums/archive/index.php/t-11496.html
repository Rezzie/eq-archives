<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">azuraine</div><div class="date">06-30-04, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here is my second TF guide:<br />
<br />
Basics<br />
*Started in Steel Canyon at Positron<br />
*Team must have 3-8 heroes<br />
*Levels at formation of TF 10-16(actual levels without side kicking)<br />
*No one can be added to TF after it is formed<br />
*TF members can side kick members 3 or more levels below them.<br />
*Heroes Disconnected or who camp out without quitting the TF will automatically rejoin the TF unless all members have quit the TF or it has been completed<br />
*You cannot talk to contacts other then Positron during the TF but may still use stores<br />
*TF leader will have to contact Positron to flag/start the next mission when one is completed(you will later be able to call him as you progress.<br />
*Everyone must be in the zone to start the TF<br />
*Positron's TF takes 3-6 hours to complete<br />
*All members that complete the TF recieve a Single Origin(SO) Enhancement at the end-if they have room<br />
<br />
The Task Force<br />
Once you have your team formed, the leader of the team needs to speak to Positron. Positron is located in Steel Canyon, in front of the big statue in Blyde Square. The leader accepts formation of a TF and then get the first mission. This TF consists of 15 separate missions. Most times it will be 11 door missions, 1 Patrol(visiting locations/phones), and 3 deliveries/see contacts. The first door mission is Vahzilok. The embalmed can cause severe damage when they self destruct- try to take them out first. The second building will be Circle of Thorns, again Ruin and Energy Mages can kill quickly with their self destruct. To minimize the chance of Mages exploding- never have more then 1 melee on any mage, also make sure that a non-mage is left(Thorn Weilder, Guard etc). Your third door will be Clockwork most likely. All doors will invovle these 3. After your first 3 door mission you can expect 2 more doors before Positron tells you to deliver an item to a contact in Atlas- any TF member can do this mission. You will then get another door mission. Next mission is to see a contact in Kings Row, again any TF member can do this one. The leader should now be able to CALL Positron. The next mission is to see an Atlas City contact. Usually Positron needs to see the leader at this point, but sometimes not. Now another door mission. Next is a Patrol (visit 3 locations/phones usually in Perez Park), again send your fastest. Another 3 door missions follow. Last mission is a door- usually a Hi-Tech Laboratory. All 3 groups of villians will be here. Make sure people sell and have room for the enhancements that drop- especially the S.O. that everyone will get. There is no arch villian, and it may seem anti-climatic, but rest assured you did well to complete it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mikebridge</div><div class="date">07-10-04, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if the levels for the TF are 11-16, is it just a lowlevel SO enhancement that you get or something? only ones i've seen have been in stores and are like lvl 25+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">azuraine</div><div class="date">07-11-04, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Positron's reward SO is lvl 18 <br />
Synapse= 23 <br />
Psyche=28 <br />
Bastion=33 <br />
 <br />
Regardless of your level doing the TF the level of the SO awarded is the same.(See above for level of the SO for completing each TF). <br />
 <br />
I hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
