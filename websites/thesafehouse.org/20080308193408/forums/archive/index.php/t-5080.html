<br />
If I snare it and re-log will that work? I'm afraid I wont have enough time to get out o game before the pet catche up with me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your best bet is to train the pet into realm guards / friends of yours / mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lakeb</div><div class="date">05-23-02, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand from other posts that pets are supposed to be able to track you if you turn invis... whether this is one of those bugs that they kept on purpose or part of the initial design is unknown.  They rationallize it as pets are able to follow your scent once they have agroed onto you.<br />
<br />
However, it would be a big help if we had some kind of counter like a confusion poison.  As it is... best advice is to just not attack unless you can kill the pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just look at the druids/filidhs/isolationists.  They're human.  If we can't pick up a stealther's scent, why can they?<br />
<br />
Or what about the giant crabs?  I didn't know crabs were world renowned in their olfactory sense.<br />
<br />
Do I really need to explain the tree spirits? ;)</div></div><hr />
