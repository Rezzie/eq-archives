Given some of your gripes about 3e, I thought you may want to take a peek at it.<br />
<br />
I only briefly clicked through to see whether or not it had been fully developed as an idea before posting, but have no idea if it's any good or not.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd share</div></div><hr />

Quote:<br />
Creating a good story is more important than following the rules. <br />
<br />
Anything essential to the story automatically happens. <br />
<br />
Anything that derails the story automatically fails. <br />
<br />
Anything that is not believable (within the license of the genre) automatically doesn’t happen. <br />
<br />
The GM is the judge on when Primary Rules #1, 2, 3, and 4 apply and when they don’t. <br />
<br />
Primary Rule #3 should not be interpreted to mean that Player Characters can’t be killed. Named characters can die in the movies (although usually in slow motion with some dramatic last words) and the suspense is necessary to make the game dramatic. <br />
<br />
All other rules provide structure for the game but the GM can change or ignore them (or “cheat”) at any time to make the story work. <br />
-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
Not so unlike most sessions...only DMs don't usually come out and say things like this. Reminds me of LARP in a sense. However, the pure player value of rolling dice to succeed can't be ignored, otherwise players feel like puppets in the hands of the DM(which they are, but the more aware of that they are, the more hostile they can get depending on how the story turns).<br />

Quote:Skills That Require Training: Some Skills are fairly intuitive and can be improvised even without any training.  Others are not so straightforward.  Skills that “require training” must be at rank 1 or better to be attempted.  If these Skills are Checked while at rank 0, the Check automatically fails.   Such skills will be marked by a “(T)” symbol in their description.<br />
<br />
Not real sure how much I like this, but, it plays into the aforementioned rules of this guy's system ok.<br />
<br />
Glanced at the skills. He has some in there I might steal and incorporate as 2e non-weapon Profs. Thanks for the postage Llabak.<br />
