<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Solanar</div><div class="date">09-29-02, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, like I mentioned in my previous post, I've only played D&amp;amp;D one time, at a con in tampa. There were two GMs, one table of lawful good and one table of lawful evil, starting from opposite ends of a single dungeon.<br />
<br />
I don't know why the good team was there, but us evils had heard a story about some supa valuable treasures to steal, including some magic items to make us all mega powerful. For the purposes making the game more interesting and faster for people who weren't experienced roleplayers and D&amp;amp;D'ers, there were pre-created characters, I think they were level 7, and the spell lists and inventories were ready-made by the GMs as well.<br />
<br />
They shuffled out the character sheets, and I end up a warrior-thief. Thief, cool, I'm down with this.<br />
<br />
For some reason the cleric can't rule the undead (it's explained later on...) but we hack through the first few battles just fine.<br />
<br />
Then we go in a room that has a table with some gold on it, and one special coin sitting by itself that was faintly glowing. Being a thief, I snatched it all up quick - but when I touched the glowing coin, a gong echo'd through the entire dungeon. My party was pissed off, told me to leave the loud money alone, should any more crop up.<br />
<br />
And more did - and I continued to grab it. One of the warriors tried to beat me to it one time, but I was faster - after the second time, my party (one member in particular) were actively angry with me, saying I was trying to ruin it by letting the other group know where we were. The GM wouldn't let them kill me for it, but in a passive aggressive sense they were, since I always got helped last and never healed.<br />
<br />
One of the warriors managed to get a magic sword, so when some gargoyles showed up, he was the only one able to hurt them. I had some boots of levitation, and some rope - I went straight up, tried to lasso one, failed, and then just kept going, hoping they'd kill my party before coming after me, and maybe I could make it out the top of the mountain the dungeon was in.<br />
<br />
All the useless party members did while one guy did damage and I continued trying to escape was disbelieve in the gargoyles repeatedly and hope they'd disappear.<br />
<br />
However, no one died, due to some really lucky rolls by the one warrior able to accomplish anything. I came down, we moved on.<br />
<br />
Skipping some of the more elementary fights, totally ignoring my critical fail on a backstab, we finally come up on the good party - they're in a dead end room at the end of a hallway. <br />
<br />
I let some caster chick have one of my gold pieces (and cried about it) and she cast a spell of silence on the coin and we thew it down into the room they were in - some quick thinking individual realized what had happened and tossed it back. Warrior tried to catch it and failed, but I managed to grab it on the fly and chunk it back - and it was followed by a beautiful fireball, as soon as our group could make noise again.<br />
<br />
The fireball starts to explode in the enclosed room - we're expecting a total wipeout!!<br />
<br />
Then some godforsaken super powered GM mega wizard teleports everyone out of the dungeon (into an arena type area) heals all of us, gives back what spells have been used up, and begins a slow clap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bravo, bravo! Excellent job by all of you! I haven't had this much fun in years! Listen, I know wanted some things, and I have a few gifts to give, but only to the winners, and there isn't a winner yet!&quot;<br />
<br />
Our casters all get upset, saying we should have won - the loudmouthed warrior chooses discretion for once - I try to hide.<br />
<br />
Remember those glowing coins I kept grabbing up? They were each good for my choice of a weapon improvement, armor improvement, or a ressurection to a fallen party member during the upcoming battle royale. I promised the warrior who had been most adamant about my death that if he died, he was staying dead.<br />
<br />
So we fought, and evil prevailed - I pickpocketted 2 coins and a bottle of perfume from the good team, gave a resurrection, and had a great time.<br />
<br />
