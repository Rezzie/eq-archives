<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Karlek</div><div class="date">05-09-01, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">spun off by the idea Ulster made jokingly on VZ boards:<br />
<br />
(I post within arena 'cos team games are what its about :P)<br />
<br />
Imagine a spell called 'conjure ball' and 'conjure goal' that materialize appropriate object.<br />
<br />
Ball - a lightened, maybe pulsating ball that can be pushed by running onto it, like the mobs and chars get pushed back when hit in combat, but more sliding to it. If ball is front of you and you press attack, it gets propelled toward the direction you are facing (given the ball is in front of you). Ball also floats on the water. Only the members of your group can touch the ball.<br />
<br />
One more group can cast 'conjure ball' with existing ball selected - this another group also 'attaches' to the ball (e.g. can hit it). No more groups can then attach to the ball.<br />
<br />
Goal - floats on water too, can be set on clear ground as well. Has special property that displays the number of times a ball has hit its net (or thereabouts :P)<br />
<br />
---<br />
So 2 groups of 6 could play one against other. Even with PvP rules eventually. I still dont know how to regulate the power of the kick yet...<br />

<br />
I thought also that damage could determine the power of the hit, but that would be random.<br />
<br />
We need some sort of quick slider of sorts or 3 strengths of punches/kicks to choose from as command in macro heh, i.e.<br />
<br />
/ball plop - sends it virtual 5 meter [ca 15ft]<br />
/ball hit - sends it virtual 15 meter [ca 45-50ft]<br />
/ball smash - sends it from 15m upwards (wild random?)<br />
<br />
---<br />
Also for PvP servers or goals placed within arenas, PvP rules could be agreed upon (i.e. no blinding of opponents hehe) limited charm that gets you additional member hehe? <br />
