Apparently there's more to come, and there are supposed distinctions between archetype subclasses. They are not &quot;branched&quot; and are all unique according to all the previous information released on them. There aren't any current plans to release any descriptions at this time.<br />
<br />
That's a pretty extensive list to fawn over. :D</div></div><hr />

Lifetime supply?  We created borg implants back at SOE and they're still functioning fine :)</div></div><hr />

What's my point?  The class list is extremely similar to EQ's.  Not too surprising since many of the creative drivers of this game are the same folks from EQ.  However, I really hope that it doesn't come across as 'too similar' since that would honestly decrease the longevity of the game for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it seems as if they are going to be of the same class....but when you see how all the other stuff is being planned out....its no way like EQ other than the names of the classes.<br />
<br />
I wanna be a spy</div></div><hr />

Me to but the cops called it something else when they took me out of my neighbors bushes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryana</div><div class="date">05-26-05, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With regard to the posted list of classes, yes there are some similarities to the names of the classes in EQ, but judging by what I saw and was told at E3, that's where a lot of similarities will end. I guess time will tell.<br />
<br />
Oh, before I forget, here's a quote from Brad in his first post of the thread:<br />
<br />
I'll post a list of the classes that we feel confident about, leaving out a few that we still need to work with more, but with the caveat that we can't reveal a lot of the details behind them yet.<br />
<br />
It seems that there are classes that they're not talking about yet.<br />
<br />
Here's the link (http://www.vanguardsoh.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=14055) to the entire thread.</div></div><hr />

Tel, those are basically the same classes 90% of all fantasy rpgs have. Compare them to  the list of D&amp;D classes...</div></div><hr />

Sure I'm gonna make a rogue, but a fox blood mage sounds like something I would love playing.  I hope I can be a fox man with no pants, a monocle, a top coat, and a top hat that control blood.. pure awesome!</div></div><hr />
