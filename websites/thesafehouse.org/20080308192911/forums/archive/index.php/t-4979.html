<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_meepo elfkiller</div><div class="date">03-23-02, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it stands now I am a lvl 30 Norseman Shadow blade. My current specs with out items are 25 stealth, 25<br />
sword and 26 critical strike. Now my question mainly has to do with sword skill. Do I need to take sword past 25 or can I take those points and put them into envenom or left axe.. my definite plans are to take stealth to 35 and critical strike to 39. So should I leave sword at the 25 its at now whichould be 50% weapon spec at lvl 50 and train envenom or left axe ? or stay with the 3 specs i have now and have something like a 40, 40, 40 by the time i reach 50th. I know alot depends on play styles. Mine is the traditional role of an assasin I want to get the highest possible perf damage I can. What I am not sure of is does having 2/3 spec or higher in sword have anything to do with your crit strike style damage or perf damage ? I kep hearing that you must spec your weapon which is why I was going this route but to be honest my lvl 33 kobold blade only has a 12 in sword with the rest at 31 critical 25 stealth 25 envenom, and I don't notice a big damage boost from having the poins in sword. If speccing sword only helps in PvE or when using no styles then I'm not sure why to spec it at all as a rogue using a base atack is either dead or part of a much larger group that is killing some poor vader or critter. Sorry to sound so noob on the issue, lol I have been playing since october (quit for 2 months in december) but I have never fully understood the need for wapon spec as I have heard that it does not affect crit strike damage. So where would you put the points from now on if you were me ? Just wondering because I don't want to waste any points on skills that won't further my goal of being a &quot;caster/archer/rogue&quot; killer. Well as always any and all advice is appreciated and welcomed.<br />

<br />
Critical Strike gives you the STYLES/ATTACKS... it is not a stand alone system!<br />
<br />
Your weapon training give you the Damage. Mythic has stated multiple times an Assassin should be at MINIMUM 50% trained. If being minimally effective is acceptable it should work. <br />
<br />
I found that boosting weapon training from 80-85% had a phenomal affect. Envenom is way too good to not get high. And ya hafta have stealth to survive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck. It's the most interesting class in the game (assassins).<br />
