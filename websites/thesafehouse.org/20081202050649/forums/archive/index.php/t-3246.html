Silver Ring<br />
Silver Chaslice of Moonbow<br />
Torin's Ring (Ok, i showed it to his brother, now what do I do?  Throw it away?)<br />
Brooch<br />
Official Document<br />
Scented Fetish (Do I destroy this now that I've saved the animals?)<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appriciated.  I finished chap 1 and am just about ready to go to the chap 1 finally<br />
<br />
Also:  Is there any place to get the rogue's helm in chap 1 finally or chap 2?  I don't have quite enough to buy it right now.  I'd have to sell off alot of stuff that I have sitting around.  But if I'm going to have to wait a while or not have a shot to buy it again at all, I'll sell off to get it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help. --------------------------<br />

No idea either, never found a quest for those two either.<br />
<br />

Just throw them away or keep them until you change chapters. The game will remove any story/quest-related items you don't need anymore then. Okay, sometimes it will even remove items that you thought you will still need in the next chapter... or it won't remove items even though you don't need them anymore - but hey, what would a game be without bugs?  <br />
<br />
<br />
About that rogue's helmet - I remember getting it at some point in chapter 1 or 2... sorry, but I don't remember the exact time/quest/encounter I got it from. I think it was after killing a rather hard caster. My guess right now would have been that caster Meldanen or his pupil... but not sure on that. ShadowCross Bladesong<br />

I just don't want to move on if I'm not going to be able to buy it later.  I still don't have anything on my head but I only have 2400 and it's like 5k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The silver Chalice of moonbow is (I think) the doodad that the klutzy cleric gives you when you hire her. These are supposed to be vitally important, but I havent seen any use out of it yet.<br />
<br />
Actually, now I think, it may also be the artifact that the bio in the book says she's after.... Edited by: Kintire at: 7/10/02 9:44:21 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, as it is flagged as a quest item and can't be sold. We aren't talking about those regular cash-item-rings.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the cleric gives you a flower, not that chalice... I found the chalice in a chest, so it has to be for a quest - can't be sold either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah the chalice is something the elven cleric is trying to retrieve because a thef stole it from her a few times. (I've been going through and modyfying scripts for a mod I'm working on and I happened to rip her's apart last night.) the brooch is for the half orc guy, it was his mothers I believe.<br />
the ring I'm not positive on right now, I'll take a peep through the conversation files of the main npc's tonight when I get home and see what I see. 1 Crow bad news<br />

 I think the monk henchman wants that ring.<br />

<br />
Silver Chalice of Moonbow- This is for Linu's Side quest<br />
<br />
Brooch- This is most likely for Daelan's side quest<br />
<br />
Official Document- Most likely for Tomi's side quest<br />
<br />
Best bet is to hire each one on and go through their dialogue until they finish telling their stories. If you have the item in your inventory you'll have the option of saying &quot;Is this the (insert item here) that you're looking for?&quot; Definitely do Tomi's quest, well worth it.<br />
<br />
Also, The lock of Nymph hair is for Sharwyn's second side quest in chapter 2.<br />

<br />
But I observe from the posts that you get quests each chapter. At lvl 12 I haven't had one yet. You're supposed to get to level 13 in chapter one? No wonder some of the fights have been a little tough....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DreebleK</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heya:<br />
<br />
 If you leave a chapter before finishing a henchman's quest, I'm pretty sure you're out of luck forever on that henchman's series of quests.  Basically, at the end of chapter 1, before continuing on, you should hire _all_ the henchpeople, one by one, and go through all the &quot;tell me more&quot; conversations with them until you get all their quests completed.  Level 8 should be sufficient for this.  Before advancing past chapter 2, do this again.  Etc.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Dreeble</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, hire all the henchmen, then talk, gain a level, talk, etc until they tell you what they want.<br />
<br />
Then they give you some ok equipment that sticks with you between chapters. Then in chapter two repeat the first bit again and they upgrade the items they gave you.<br />
<br />
The ring from Tomi is pretty decent after the Chapter 2 upgrade.<br />
