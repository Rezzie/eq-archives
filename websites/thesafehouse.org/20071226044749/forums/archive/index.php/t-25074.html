Heh, the batch of the first season from Solar is my most seeded file, ever. Got it burned to two DVD's, and still on my harddrive for seeding :p</div></div><hr />

This series continues to be awesome. I am so happy. :heart</div></div><hr />

Altho i find myself superimposing Kyon's (from Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu) face over Miyama's face, cause his seiyuu's voice is so darn distinct &gt;_o</div></div><hr />

The HD release from solar cripples both my comps. I've never had that happen before.<br />
 <br />
However, from what I do manage to see between bouts of severe lag, is drop-dead-gorgeous. This marks the first time I've ever wanted to upgrade a computer to watch anime... O.o</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats odd...only really had that happen when .hack//roots had HD releases but ends up it was them b/c it happened in the intro at the same place both times. But damn was it ******* awesome looking.<br />
<br />
Did you try updateing CCP? They have had a few MKV/HD enhancements since a long time go.<br />
<br />
Edit: Scrolling/FF did have some lag but would be expected with all the filters going at once and at max heh.</div></div><hr />

Ya i like zoom player better...dunno why really just seems better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">07-17-06, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a side note, watching an ep of H&amp;C follwed by an episode of Mushishi makes me feel all warm inside, like life really isn't so bad.<br />
 <br />
I mean, come on. HD H&amp;C and Mushishi ep20 combined are like smoking a massive amount of pot, and eating a couple twinkies. Why worry about anything? It makes all that middle east nonsense just seem like a terrible bother.<br />
 <br />
I'm high on life via anime. ^^</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 <br />
Dealing totally with Rika and Mayama, this episode gave me what I wanted: lots of quite introspective into my favorite tragic character. Seeing Mayama finally step up and admit what he was thinking was great. The scene at the ruins of Rika's home was haunting and exquisite. The upward beat at the end of the episode where Mayama sees Rika off at the airport helps to liven the mood a little, after all that heavt drama.<br />
<br />
All in all, this series is rolling right along on the train to total awesome.<br />
 <br />
Ya know, I'd love to see some kinda prequel OAV that dealt with the time when Harada was still alive, and living in the apartment with Shuu and Rika.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
episode 1 on the first series:<br />
FREAKING HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!! This show has me hooked, first episode, bam.. im hooked, i guess its time to marathon the episodes to catch up so i can watch honey and clover 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">08-01-06, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure to get the Solar releases. They rock.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">08-31-06, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This series has become something even more than awesome. The somewhat darker, more 'real' tone just sets it up so well, and the animation this season is to die for. The snow falling in ep 9 was beautiful, I cant wait for the HD release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darcean</div><div class="date">09-27-06, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just got the time to watch all 24(im on 21 at the moment)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">09-29-06, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">News:<br />
Last episode of the 2nd series is out.<br />
 <br />
Bad News:<br />
Takemoto's VA was injured an a car accident prior to recording dailogue for it... So someone else is doing the voice of Takemoto in the final episode. It sounds... different.<br />
 <br />
Good News:<br />
The DVD will have the original voice.<br />
 <br />
Also Good News:<br />
Solar has stated they will release a fansubbed DVD rip of episode 12 with the original voice, providing it is not liscenced by then.<br />
 <br />
Other News:<br />
It's over    :frown  <br />
Thanks for the good times! :beer</div></div><hr />

I've been postponing it for a while for some reason. I know it's excellent but it's like I haven't been in the mood for it. Maybe next week, I'm busy with Oblivion now heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Episode 9.....<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ok finished the series. It was unbelievably awesome. Hagu picking Shuu completely stunned me. I expected Morita. I rooted for Takemoto (I guess, because I can relate to him a lot. I did a lot of similar things as him growing up). All in all, everything wrapped up nicely. I wanted to see more of Yamada's new romance and where it went, though. It was heartwrenching end, because it was like... &quot;that's it, there's no more. Everyone's gone now.&quot; It made me really sad. Reminded me of a lot of painful goodbyes when I left school, too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">degenxsn</div><div class="date">05-14-07, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so im starting to watch honey and clover 1 and im about 5 eps in but its not really grabbing me. does it get better later or does is it the same thing and its just that i probably wont get into it? it seems to me to be pretty random.<br />
<br />
ill put the rest into spoiler just because it might be but i dont think so<br />
<br />
i think i could get into it more if every single character wasnt shrouded in mystery. i cant get into the characters at least yet since its not really letting me know any of them. do their stories get more fleshed out as i go along and do they stop being so mysterious?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">05-14-07, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...mysterious and random are not the usual terms I hear assosiated with H&amp;C :-p <br />
 <br />
Ah well, everyone sees things differently. Yes, the characters get 'fleshed-out'. You find out why Morita is such a spaz, ect. Just sit back, relax, listen to the music, and enjoy the pretty colors.</div></div><hr />
