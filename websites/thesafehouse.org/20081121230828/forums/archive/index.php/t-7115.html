<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kataliya</div><div class="date">11-05-02, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm toying with the notion of making a warrior, and wanted to use Magelo to screw around a bit and compare a gnome to, say, an ogre.<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me what the naked ATK and AC would be for a level 65 gnome warrior who allocated all starting points to STA (ie, his base stats would be str70, sta105, agi90, dex85)?<br />
<br />
Or, is there a forumula I might employ to determine this information?<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for the assistance!   <br />

You have to create an account (free), but it gives you access to a nice Atk/HP/Mana tool that reflects accurately based on level/stats/gear -- and you can tinker with whatever uber gear is in their database.  Its pretty cool.<br />

Sta affects HP (20hp at 60 = 100 or 120hp)<br />
Str affects ATK and how much you can carry (1 str = 1 ATK at 60, give or take a little)<br />
Dex affects proc rate<br />
<br />
Just put all you can in stamina, and the rest probably in Str.</div></div><hr />

<br />
gnomes are cool, if you dont mind having bug eyes when wearing a plate helm :oP<br />
<br />
they are also kind of pudgy...and bald....they do fly farther then halflings though DISCLAIMER:  <br />
This is my opinion.  As such, it should not be taken as fact even though I believe it to be so.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and as much of a voice to them as is given me.  Please do not judge my words too harshly.  They are only my words and as such, are only as powerful as you make them.</div></div><hr />

They get 25 points to add. CR suggests STR but I would slap them all in STA<br />
