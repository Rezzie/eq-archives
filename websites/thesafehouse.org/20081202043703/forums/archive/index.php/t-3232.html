But yeah, you'll be able to log in any time you want after you create a character on the server and hang out, plus there's going to be places you can level up at while we're not running a module.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glip the Gnome</div><div class="date">07-07-02, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah thats my biggest beef with 3rd Edition, and therefor NWN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Halflings ARE Hobbits.  They are the exact same thing.  They are around the same size as dwarves.  They are plump, and they have big friggin hairy feet.  If they don't have that stuff they aren't halflings.<br />
<br />
Gnomes are little old men.  They have beards and big noses.  Not pointy beak noses and goatees.<br />
<br />
And more spikes isn't always good.  But don't tell Todd Lockwood that</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true for the P&amp;amp;P version of D&amp;amp;D 3rd.<br />
<br />
Gnomes in there certainly don't have pointy noses or goatees.   Too bad I wasn't able to find the pic from the Player's Handbook somewhere on the web, or I'd link it.. and I don't have the time to scan it now.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Glip, get online with IM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glip the Gnome</div><div class="date">07-07-02, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got all the books, gnomes look like mini elves and halfligns look the same except for a little smaller and more coneshaped heads. <br />
<br />
 Halflings look more like Kender in 3rd Edition than they look like halflings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, Halflings look a lot like Kenders in 3rd... but I don't think Gnomes look like Elves.<br />
<br />
Granted, they look more like Elves than before - as compared to 2nd Edition.. there wasn't a pic of gnomes in the 1st Edition. But still they look rather &quot;gnome-like&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sneakster Shenanigans</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">..............are you telling me Halflings don't have big hairy feet?</div></div><hr />

3 Crows a wedding<br />
4 Crows a birth<br />
5 Crows for riches<br />
6 Crows a thief</div></div><hr />

<br />
kender are akin to that annoying little guy in everyones homeroom class who was scrawny and made up for it by being annoying and abrasive... they all deserve painful painful deaths.<br />
<br />
hobbits are funny little hairy footed men who smoke pipes of homegrown shire herbs.<br />
<br />
how can you NOT hate 3rd edition version of halflings? Azeroeth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_RKRazor</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">halflings in 3rd edition are very much comparable to kender now.  My hafling is based on a kender and let me tell ya he does get into trouble in p&amp;amp;p games.  Old DM used to go nuts with him and now i'm going nuts DMing him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And /agree Kroe - I would have never played a halfling if they'd look like hobbits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I kinda liked the fat smarmy look of the old halflings.  Too dang thin now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now someone in a earlier post on a earlier thread mentioned linking to other mods?  Is this possible?  If so I think the potential is so unlimited.  Imagine meeting your contact in the Safehouse, you assemble your party, plan your dungeon delve, and then portal into harms way.  After it's all over, a trip to your local tavern for brewskis, and celebrations.<br />

You'd have to make an exact replica of your general character into the safehouse, and actually switch to the main character to go adventure once the deal is struck ?<br />

<br />
Also, are there any other famous (really really famous, not just really famous like me = ) Safehouse personalities besides Remmi that are not pictured?  From the beginning until now I mean.<br />
