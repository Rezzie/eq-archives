<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">04-01-07, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I've been busy a while, like the last 6-7 months and not really paying attention to a lot of developments.  I'm playing catch up and just saw all of this (actually came to it by way of catching up on aod forums, but I wanted to post here).<br />
<br />
I really want the broadcast order discs but damn if I'm willing to pay double the price.  Yeah yeah it's a lot of extras, and I'm usually willing to pay for a boat load of stupid extras I'll never use after the initial futzing about with them after procurement on a first volume purely in order to get the box.  And I'll only need to buy vols 2-4 to get the discs I want.  But a $60 MSRP LE for each?  <br />
<br />
I can't do it.  I just can't.  Even after online discounts it's still too much.  I'm tempted to, for once in my life, give the big middle finger to the DVD release and just stick with the fansubs.  I've never done this.  But I don't like being manipulated like this either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-01-07, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well let's be fair, and give the whole situation. It may or may not make a difference, but at least you'll have all the info at hand.<br />
<br />
First, the region 2 version of Haruhi did not get the broadcast order. When Bandai was trying to work with the distributors, they refused to let us have the broadcast order version. After a hell of a lot of debate, they allowed the broadcast order to come as a bonus, but did not allow it to be dubbed.<br />
<br />
So the blame for this lies entirely with the Japanese company. It is somewhat unfair to rob Bandai of what they tried their hardest go bring over.<br />
<br />
Of course, I am speaking solely from the perspective that you are boycotting the release solely on this issue. There's more to it, and ultimately, it's your money, you can do buy or not buy it for any reason.<br />
<br />
Though, to be honest, not being able to spend $40 per DVD (after discounts) is completely understandable. However, why not buy the regular edition? The only benefit the broadcast order DVD's offer is not having to change DVD's occassionally.<br />
<br />
By volume two, you can watch episodes 2 to five broadcast order. You'll have to skip episode one, but it is an extremely disposable (albeit, awesome) episode.<br />
<br />
I'll be buying the limited edition myself, because the collector in me won't allow otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">04-01-07, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I know I know.  I've been through all the info on it.  It doesn't change the anger I feel over it.  And just because they had to put them out in a LE doesn't mean each and every one had to be a $60 set.  That's outrageous.  Or at LEAST make it a LE with something good, like a nice figure, as opposed to junk like an armband and a pillowcase.  Something I can justify spending an extra $30 on.<br />
<br />
And in all likelyhood I WILL end up getting the regular editions, once they are all released, and just doing a disc swap to watch them.  Hopefully anyone I lend the show to will be willing to do the swaps to watch it correctly.  Like I said, I've never outright boycotted a release and stuck with fansubs (except in cases where the show was heavily editted and chopped up), so it's highly unlikely I will this time.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, just a couple of years ago, I'd probably have begrudgingly coughed up the money.  But things are different now, and financial commitments have to go different places.  I somewhat envy anyone who can justify the expense, but it's still a little beyond ridiculous to have to spend twice the price, to get the release as it should be.  Regardless of who is responsible for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">07-25-07, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Riviving this thread, but I think some of you might be interested in this- amazon.ca is selling the 3rd Limited Ed. boxset for 26CDN! I dunno how long it'll be up for this price (for comparison, the 1st box is like almost 100CDN and the 2nd is in the mid 70s), but it's been this way for at least a few days. Link is http://www.amazon.ca/o/ASIN/B000SK5YXU/</div></div><hr />
