<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_3point14</div><div class="date">05-11-00, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just logged off from a good night in EQ. I got my RS gloves tonight, and noone in the group seemed to realize what that means to a young rogue. I figured my brothers and sisters here would understand the Joy of winning the lotto on something that everyone rolls for, but only you can use.<br />
<br />
Here's the Story:<br />
<br />
I'm only level 25 (was 24 when I logged in) I had been shouting for a group in CT for about an hour, and noone was hireing.... unless you were a cleric or an enchanter of course.<br />
<br />
The SG group began asking for 2 members, high 20's or low 30's to fill out their group. I walked my way down there and asked if I could fill some space till they got a replacement. They let me in, but kept calling for more people. Not a prob.<br />
<br />
Those Gators started coming in like no tomorrow, as we had a monk on coke and a cleric on crack. Anyway, we get about 15 or 30 minutes of fighting done, only taking downtime when the pools were empty. We had already picked up a ranger to the group, so we had a full 6. The group leader, wether through forgetfullness, or contentedness stops calling for people. I didn't mention this to anyone, just kinda stayed quiet, and got my BS's in.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the group starts rotating out people, we get some new faces, and a couple were surprised at seeing me there so young (24 at this point). They seemed to forget my level when I open fights with a 60 point BS though (Stiletto of the Bloodclaw, gift from my guild leader when I joined). As the group rotates we begin going light on healers, and really heavy on tanks. at one point, we're stuck with a Bard, 2 rangers, a Palladin, a monk, and me. all of a sudden, we see a new level 32 Druid come into the zone and shout for a group. Seeing as the group needs the healing badly, I remind the Bard and Palli (the only original members left) that I was there in a temp basis, and that they should grab the healer. The Bard then says she's been there for 5 hours now, and could easily spend the rest of her night doing some shopping back up in freeport, she left and made sure I would stick around in the group (thank you Ajaxis, I think I'll tag along to help when you go for that Lambent BP).<br />
<br />
So there I was, in a group that was pretty light on, healing, near nil for nuking, and heavy on the melee output. I got my level about 4 gators into this group. and we proceded to do well from there. we had a couple close calls when the SG came up (saw about 5 of them, and quite a few PH's)coming down to the end of the night, we knew we were going to have to leave soon, the Druid had to log, and the pallie had to go to work in a few hours... The ranger announces Inc, and it's decided this is the last pull of the night....<br />
<br />
Up outta the water, the SG came, beat the tar outta the ranger before we could get it off him to the pallie. We ran the Druid outta mana on heals, could not get a single snare to stick, and the Pallie had to use LoH to save his arse. BUT, we did it, we killed that SoB.<br />
<br />
And I won my gloves!<br />
<br />
God it feels good to get a peice of equipment like that and not have to pay for it!  <br />
<br />
<br />
Have a nice day all, it's time for me to get some sleep!<br />
<br />
