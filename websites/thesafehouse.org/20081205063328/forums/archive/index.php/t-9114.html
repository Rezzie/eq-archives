<br />
Yea, it's fine. Any template is fine, just enjoy yourself. I'm just disgusted by the majority of the people who share my class. I'm an Fire/Energy Tanker and I'd beat their asses into the ground any day of the week.<br />
<br />
I actually hear Stone Melee has fantastic damage. Though stone armor does kind of look like a walking turd.<br />
<br />
Pratell has to listen to be bitch about Invuln/SS tanks all the time, poor guy.</div></div><hr />

Is one just as good as the other in terms of damage output? Is one more advantageous? The primary on this character will be Invulnerability, if that makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnmish Gearbinder</div><div class="date">05-18-04, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a fair amount of Invuln/Energy tankers out there. Energy causes disorientation which is great, I rely on Disorient and Knockdown to keep my HP up. You don't see a whole lot of Fire Secondary tankers, can't comment much on them.<br />
<br />
As I said for Dragyn, I would advise playing whatever fits your concept. Screw everyone else.</div></div><hr />

What a concept!! i thought everyone wanted to be l33t super heros and not just ho hum heros.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The friction I've found isn't between Firey Aura and anyone, it's between Invuln/SS and everyone else.<br />
<br />
Damn you for not following the herd! You can't possibly be as uber as someone who NEVER ATTACKS AND JUST POUNDS TAUNT AND PROVOKE! Heh...told you I get a little agitated.<br />
<br />
 :crazy</div></div><hr />

Oh well... Hope people don't assume I was trying to min/max everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everyone.<br />
<br />
Cruise the official Tanker boards for a bit and you'll see what I mean though Meddik. Sounds like the old DAoC &quot;you must use this spec or you're gimped&quot; rhetoric all over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">05-18-04, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One tip on a Stone/Stone, you may want to not get the primary skills Mud Pots, and Rock Armor instead going for the power pool stamina.  Stone/Stone eats endurance like you wouldn't believe.  <br />
<br />
The damage is good but the attacks are somewhat slow to recharge, so you'll want to be using stone hands, stone mallet and heavy mallet as much as possible for damage.  Unfourtunately heavy mallet drains about 15% of your endurance and that's with 2 DO endurance drain lowerer thingies.<br />
<br />
Mud Pots is an OK skill, since it's PBAOE is decent for holding aggro, but nothing killer, plus it's going to further eat your eundurance.<br />
<br />
Many people will scoff at not getting rock armor, since the armor set is what makes a tank, but you can get stone skin, which is an always on resistance to smashing and lethal, the same things rock armor protects against.  Plus once you get up high enough to get Granite armor, you'll have a smashing lethal armor.<br />
<br />
Of course there are skills in the secondary powerset you can not pick up.  Of these I think hurl boulder is probably the best candidate to drop, followed by either fault or tremor, but I find both of these to be quite useful, that may be personal play style however.</div></div><hr />

Now I know why, hehehe I had never heard of people dissing other tanks though.  I mean I have yet to see a template that just isnt useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-18-04, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I wanted invul/ss because I didn't like anything elemental altering my avatars looks.

<br />
If you ask me, at this stage in the game, you could do nothing better than to play what you like, because the future of things in CoH may just be a toss of the dice.<br />

Really isn't a matter of IT, really.  Stone just looks like crap, literally.  Ice also obstructs the costume.  And Fire isn't as defensively oriented.  So if you want to play a good tank and look good, Invul is your choice.<br />
<br />
That's also why you see so many SS tankers.  Image.  SS itself isn't the best.  Overall, it is mediocre.  Stone does what SS does, but does it better.  Axe deals damage the quickest and does the most knockdowns.  Ice is probably the best defensive secondary, with slows and ice patch.  Fire does more damage to groups of mobs.  Energy is the master of stun, which is way better than knockback when you use US/Rooted.  And so on.  Not saying SS is bad, it isn't, just that the others have their own perks.  SS is the classic comic book melee though.  Punch stuff, no energy, no ice, no fire.  And that's why it gets picked a lot.<br />
<br />
I've got a feeling all the MUST HAVE crap will fade away as well as you level.  Invul tankers take quite a few skills to develop.  3 resists, US, TI, Invincibility.  That's 6 primary powers right there by level 18.  And you'll probably want Dull Pain too.  Add to that provoke and/or taunt, a precursor to a travel power, and a travel power, and, well, that's quite a few skills.  If you want offense as well...even more skills.  In the early levels, you're making hard choices.  But as you get more and more power slots, more and more enhancements, you'll be able to have very nice defense and have a few good (for a tanker) attacks.  Mix in SOs which make everything better still, gap widens between tanker and non-tanker.  <br />
<br />
We tankers just take time to develop.</div></div><hr />
