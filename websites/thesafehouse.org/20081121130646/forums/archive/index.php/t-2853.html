I made the map below to show Rogues how to get their Troll Hide Belts solo.<br />
Minimum Level: 31 (some fights were close)<br />

Enjoy! 131k .gif loads below this...be patient!  <br />

 Notes: - He casts Invisible on himself a short time after he spawns if no one attacks him.  Either have see invis ready or just unsneak and he'll aggro on ya.  He had done this to me once but since you sit next to him when he spawns, you can see the message &quot;A Froglok Warden casts a spell&quot; and know that he's there. <br />
  <br />
Place Holder / Warden spawn rate is 17 minutes (same throughout the dungeon).</div></div><hr />
