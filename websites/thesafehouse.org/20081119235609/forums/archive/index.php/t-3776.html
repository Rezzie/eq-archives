He talks about &quot;claw of a black drake&quot;...&quot;feathers from the Spiroc Lord&quot;....&quot;dracolich bone&quot;....<br />
<br />
I have not been able to dig up any info on the items. <br />
<br />
Spiroc Lord is in PoSky<br />
dracolich is in PoFear<br />
black drake....no idea<br />
<br />
I searched through all the posted encounters post PoP for the Spiroc Lord and dracolich but no mention of any feathers or bones..<br />

<br />
Would make sense (they all epic mobs - sorta ha ha draco can drop sk sword I think heh)<br />
<br />
<br />
Shardwing already drops a pretty cool non-magic arrow. I bet you have to put it together with spiroc feathers and the draco bone and you might have an uber neat arrow.</div></div><hr />

There has been endless conjecture but no real results. Maybe it's a broken quest, or something that was just there for flavor, or something that got removed as being unbalancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rharz drops the arrow? Just remember it was high damage back in the day for Endless Quiver, but it was non-magic</div></div><hr />
