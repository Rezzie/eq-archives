Here is my magelo.<br />
<br />
I have never even seen Drusilla yet so I'm not sure if I would be able to solo her.  I have a shaman friend who makes me those clicky heal potions and thats how I managed to kill the Droga Warlord but I need to know if its possible and if I have the right gear to do it if it is possible.<br />
<br />
Also if you have any suggestions about doing the whole drusilla part please fill me in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And with the new changes to Charassis, not sure how it would be either.<br />
<br />
<br />
But back pre-PoP, you couldn't really &quot;solo&quot; her, because she has a number of golems that are guarding her and unless you have someone who can split them, you are gonna have *major* adds for the battle. <br />
<br />
Someone else might be able to offer more recent wisdom, but you definately couldn't have soloed her back then.<br />

Named are now in the 52-55 range.  When I popped in with my 51 druid, Ms. Sathir was not up, so I do not know if they buffed her specifically.<br />
<br />
There are still 2 wanderers at zone in waiting to kill you, btw.<br />

So unless you know some tricks to single her you're in for some pain.<br />
<br />
The mobs in HS now have been upgraded in level a tad and hit up into the 250 dmg range in the East Wing. Quite similar to Droga mobs, but with slightly lower hp. Hope this helps a bit</div></div><hr />

<br />
We killed everything with no issues.<br />
Killed drusella. She dropped the belt , Acid something Belt.<br />
And her normal quest items.<br />
<br />
Over all, the changes are not that big.<br />
Saw a few other pieces of loot but nothing really spectacular.<br />
<br />
Not sure if they upped the drop rate or what, but got my Rapier of Oriin after these years.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_deadraaxilea</div><div class="date">08-27-03, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you get fully raid buffed you might be able to solo her with the gear you have, that is if she's still the same difficulty as before.<br />
<br />
the golems in the room were dblue for the most part before, so i dunno if she was changed other than drops.<br />
<br />
what i've found that works best for soloing her (assuming you have SoS), is to sneak back into the hall BEHIND her room, kill the 2 roamers, heal up, load up an old world snare poison.<br />
<br />
either pull her with a dispell item or throwing dagger (easier with dagger cause she roams the back and dispell won't land without line of sight.  by the end of the hall, smack her once to snare her, then run for zone out.  run back in, heal up, repoison (if she went too far past and is in big room before zone out just sit in hall and wait for snare to break).  <br />
<br />
/disc duelist as she rounds the corner and have at it.  she casts a lot, so use that to your advantage and backstab her, if your resists are weak, i'd recommend using some scoriae bite proc poison for the chance to interrupt her.  last time i did her, she didn't even attempt to run, but if she does she paths back TOWARD her room, not zone out, so position her as far back in hall as possible from the get go.<br />
<br />
gluck with it, i bit the dust quite a few times with another rogue friend of mine before i figured this out. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aliskat</div><div class="date">08-27-03, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heads up.<br />
<br />
I was camped out close to zone out in HS for the patch Tuesday morning and when I came back she was up.  Her guards are now big enough that they aggro when she is aggroed (can be pacified/harmonied), so a solo pull will be difficult for most rogues.<br />
<br />
Furthermore she also hits for 300 (relatively fast) now, so I would say soloing her is out of the picture unless you have extremly good gear and lots of clickies/potions/poisons to help you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_RatheBard</div><div class="date">08-27-03, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dru is only difficult because she procs a ~280 pt life tap she hits low (130's?) but if you can't out DSP her lifetap you'll never win, so your best bet is to find a way to slow her a dex debuff would also be a bonus.<br />
<br />
there is also the problem of getting her single any adds would probably be enough to take ya</div></div><hr />

3 rogues ornate and elemental equipped....<br />
We pulled her into the hallway behind her room and killed her there.... Rogue 2 held the door open Rogue 1 pulled with Myrl gaunts... Rogue 3 sat in corner when rogue 1 turned the corner all mobs were in the hall... he hit escape and mobs started turning... Dru was solo so Rogue 2 shot her with an arrow... single pull and death.... dropped monk beast dru pants and urn...fun fight if you have the tactics down.<br />

Its no-drop, and stats slightly worse then Decievers (kael quest tunic). Not too bad for the zone - I would have LOVED it pre-ToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DeputySprigg</div><div class="date">08-29-03, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just get a monk or sk to come down with you.  Dont need to clear and single pull is more reliable then escape technique.<br />
<br />
ONce singled, you can solo her pretty easy (pre elemental gear), but with the monk/sk, it will be trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Silvermouse</div><div class="date">08-29-03, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As contested as this mob is, she really should drop the urn every time so as to relieve some pressure from the masses who need it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Theivan01</div><div class="date">08-30-03, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Necro in my guild on fennin ro solo'd her quite a while back, when the cap was 60. took him a long time if I remember correctly, and he barely made it out alive.  <br />
<br />
w/ the introduction of PoP gear/clickies...I really dont doubt a properly buffed rogue, with some potions to help (DS, whatever) could prolly pull it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_dugannw</div><div class="date">08-30-03, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently watching for her off and on myself (you really have to keep up with the timing after a server reset), Ive talked with a necro that solos her reguarly, had 6 kills last I talked to him and no urn.  I found her up once so far after server reset (was a race with the necro on the way), and she didnt drop it.  I thought the angry goblin was the hard part till now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AirvhanTheRogue</div><div class="date">09-01-03, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the great info everyone, I never knew until just the other day where the heck Drusilla spawned.  I thought she spawned at the port out area but I was checking the zone and happened to run into her when running through the room.  That is a bad room, tons of mobs in it.  I knew I wouldn't be able to solo pull her so I tried to get a group there but I wasn't fast enough.  Another group arrived and took the mob.<br />
<br />
One nice piece of info.  The Angry goblin is no longer hard to get since he spawns at 2 locations now.  One in Droga and the other in Frontier Mountains.  I confirmed that they both pop on server up.</div></div><hr />

Is Drusela trackable from zone in? Is she on a 24hr respawn timer?<br />
