<br />
Completing its first full year as an individually rated network, the late-night service announced the new slate of programming on deck for 2006 at today’s Adult Swim Upfront event in New York. New series for the year are Death Clock Metalocalypse, Frisky Dingo, Assy McGee, Saul of the Mole Men and Lucy, The Daughter of the Devil. Two pilots were announced and will air later this year: Korgoth of Barbaria and That Crook’d ‘Sip. New seasons of current series Robot Chicken; Family Guy; Tom Goes to the Mayor; Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law; The Venture Bros.; Aqua Teen Hunger Force; 12oz. Mouse and Squidbillies will also air throughout the year. Adult Swim completed the first quarter of 2006 as the top-rated basic cable network among men 18-24 and men 18-34.<br />
<br />
In addition to this year’s schedule, Adult Swim outlined details of the highly anticipated feature, The Aqua Teen Hunger Force Movie Film for Theatres, slated to open in theaters this fall. The film, written by Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis, is based on their successful series about human-sized food products Meatwad, Frylock and Master Shake. The first movie based on an Adult Swim original series is an action epic that chronicles the mysterious origins of the trio and the battle over an immortal piece of exercise equipment.<br />
<br />
Following are highlights:<br />
<br />
New Series:<br />
<br />
Death Clock Metalocalypse: The world’s most popular heavy metal band leaves a trail of mayhem and destruction wherever they go. The animated comedy, from co-creators and executive producers Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha, will debut in August and feature ear-melting heavy metal and guest appearances by musicians like Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield of Metallica. Twenty episodes have been ordered.<br />
<br />
Frisky Dingo: Destroying the world seems like a lot of fun, but supervillain Killface finds that it can be a very tedious and complicated process. His nemesis, Awesome-X, is equally ambivalent about stopping Killface, as stamping out his plot fully might crush toy sales. Frisky Dingo, from Matt Thompson and Adam Reed, co-creators of Sealab 2021, will debut in September. Thirteen episodes have been ordered.<br />
<br />
Assy McGee: In a world where crooks run rampant and City Hall is soft on crime, one cop has what it takes to make things right. He’s Assy McGee, the toothpick chomping cop sniper who looks like a giant ass. He’s not much of a talker, but Assy is willing to take the first shot if he needs to eliminate a scumbag criminal. Assy McGee, from Carl Adams, Jon Benjamin and Matt Harrigan, will debut in December.<br />
<br />
Saul of the Mole Men: During a scientific expedition to the Earth’s core, a terra-naut stumbles upon a strange civilization of Mole Men--and nearly destroys it. Deftly combining live-action, puppets, animation and green screen technology, Saul of the Mole Men debuts in late 2006. Twenty episodes have been ordered.<br />
<br />
Lucy, The Daughter of the Devil: Lucy is living in San Francisco and dating a great new guy, who might just be the Second Coming. The only problem is that her dad always meddles in her life. And, since he’s Satan, he is using her relationship as an excuse to hasten the apocalypse. The series, created by Loren Bouchard, has been given the greenlight for 10 episodes and will debut in late 2006.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Seasons of Existing Series:<br />
<br />
Robot Chicken: Co-creators Seth Green and Matthew Senreich enlist an army of toys and celebrity friends to skewer pop culture in this stop-motion sketch comedy. A new season begins April 2. Ten additional new episodes are slated for September.<br />
<br />
Family Guy: The fast-moving series about the Griffin family continues with 17 new episodes beginning April 30 and airing throughout the year.<br />
<br />
Tom Goes to The Mayor: The unique partnership between bumbling bureaucrat The Mayor and self-proclaimed “idea man” Tom Peters continues in a new season of the series from Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, beginning June 4.<br />
<br />
The Venture Bros.: With Hank and Dean Venture presumably dead, Doc and Brock carry on as Team Venture and seek revenge on The Monarch and other villains in the second season of the series from Jackson Publick III. New episodes begin June 25.<br />
<br />
Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Meatwad, Frylock and Master Shake swim in their neighbor Carl’s above-ground pool and destroy things. A new season begins in September. Aqua Teen Hunger Force was created by Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis.<br />
<br />
12oz. Mouse: Mouse, fond of beer and firearms, unravels a conspiracy in a new season that begins in September. 12oz. Mouse was created by Matt Maiellaro.<br />
<br />
Squidbillies: Redneck squids scratch out a hardscrabble existence against a backdrop of brown-liquor-fueled heartache and loss in the north Georgia mountains. A new season of 14 episodes of the Williams Street series Squidbillies, from Jim Fortier and Dave Willis, begins this September.<br />
<br />
Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law: The winged superhero returns for a new season of jurisprudence and office politics beginning this fall. Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law was created by Michael Ouweleen and Erik Richter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pilots in Development:<br />
<br />
Korgoth of Barbaria: In a dark future wasteland, the cities have fallen, primordial beasts have reclaimed the globe and thieves and savages populate sparse, dirty towns. Korgoth emerges from the frozen north, and his merciless savagery may be his only key to survival. Korgoth of Barbaria is an animated fantasy-action-adventure-comedy from Aaron Springer. The half-hour pilot episode will air in September.<br />
<br />
That Crook’d ‘Sip: The Beauregard family, much like their Mississippi mansion, is falling apart. Relics of the Old South, this dysfunctional clan sits in stark contrast to the modern crunk-fueled Dirty South that has grown up around their crumbling estate, Frenchman’s Bend. The pilot for That Crook’d Sip, created by Jacob Escobedo and Nick Weidenfeld, is now in production at Williams Street and will air in the fall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anime Acquisitions:<br />
<br />
Eureka Seven: Renton is a young boy in a world where “lifting,” an extreme form of hoverboarding, is common. Renton’s life is changed forever by a mysterious and beautiful young girl named Eureka. Eureka Seven will debut on Adult Swim on Saturday, April 15.<br />
<br />
Bleach: Ichigo Kurosaki is an average 15-year-old who never asked for the ability to see ghosts. He was born with the gift. When his family is attacked by a Hollow, a malevolent lost soul, Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper, dedicating his life to protecting the innocent and helping the tortured spirits find peace. Bleach, licensed from VIZ Media, debuts this fall.<br />
<br />
InuYasha: The adventures of human girl, Kagome, and InuYasha, who is half-demon, continue with a new season. New episodes of the series, set in a mystical, feudal Japan, air on Wednesdays through September.<br />
<br />

My first thought was &quot;What a stupid idea for a show&quot;.... then I realize that I like ATHF and that show idea isn't much better.  :)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Real heavy metal, or the crapola that winds up on the increasingly misnamed MTV Headbanger's Ball? :-p <br />
 <br />
But yeah, a lot of this sounds a bit far-fetched, and tomorrow being what it is...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Otherwise, June 25th! WOOT! Go team Venture!</div></div><hr />

Didn't Brock mention that at the end of the last episode?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I remember a time when I enjoyed Adult Swim.<br />
 <br />
Robot Chicken usually doesn't fail to crack me up at least once in an episode.  I :heart the Family Guy and Futurama reruns as well, I have seen many episodes repeatedly, and still like them.  <br />
 <br />
I haven't watched Tom, Squidbillies, or 12 oz. Mouse due to the reviews here.  Haven't seen Venture Bros. yet.  <br />
 <br />
As for ATHF, Harvey Birdman, and Boondocks - I guess I just don't &quot;get it&quot;.  Morel Orel is interesting in a twisted sort of way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">03-31-06, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, i think there were multiple clones of Hank and Dean because they are such morons and get killed all the time. Didn't Brock mention that at the end of the last episode?<br />
<br />
Brock doesn't say as much, but there are three things that point to them being clones.<br />
<br />
1) Dr. Venture has no chance of getting laid and having kids.<br />
<br />
2) Brisbeeland episode where Dr. Venture professes having no knowledge of his father's cloning technology.<br />
<br />
3) Dr. Venture's reaction to the boys death &quot;Brock, get their clothes&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TorchTheDresser</div><div class="date">03-31-06, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've heard, Bleach sounds quite promising. Otherwise, it sounds like a lackluster lineup. I think they should go with a Futurama, pre-cancelled Family Guy, and Cowboy Bebop lineup. They should do a whole hour of each show too. You know what? I think they should just play those three shows until I tell them to stop. I know I'd tune in every night to see that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">03-31-06, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i just saw pictures of Lucy, Daughter of the Devil <br />
<br />
do american enjoy bad art in cartoon ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">03-31-06, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope.  But they keep giving it to us.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
American tv and radio seem to be in the habit of telling us what to like instead of giving us what we like.<br />
<br />
Kind of like the government.  :beatup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-31-06, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For what it's worth, since most of you have a vague idea of what Bleach is. Eureka SeveN is a mecha anime, the visuals are nice. I watched a little bit of it, and I was actually able to stomach it a bit. I stopped since then, but not for quality reasons. I stopped because it wasn't my niche.<br />
<br />
However, I see it praised all the time, especially for the lastest episodes. It would probably be worth checking out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">03-31-06, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well even if it sucked I'm sure I'll still end up watching the whole damn thing.  Cause it's not like I'm doing anything else at 1am.<br />
<br />
I mean, I ******* hate 12oz mouse, but I'm pretty sure I've seen every episode multiple times.</div></div><hr />

Altho if they have the same crapy VO's as naruto then i dunno if it will last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgie</div><div class="date">04-01-06, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Horray for different Family Guy reruns! Since I work 3-11 5 days a week, AS is the only chance I have of catching Family Guy. Horrah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-01-06, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm how do i put this...Bleach is like 100x better then naruto...its like naruto done right. Altho if they have the same crapy VO's as naruto then i dunno if it will last.I really disagree.  The animation for the fights is the main good thing about Bleach, it's amazing.  It's also really funny when it's being funny.<br />
<br />
If anything, Bleach is EXTREMELY DragonballZish.  Much more so than Naruto.  Naruto has explanations for why everything happens.  Bleach suffers severely from &quot;good guy suddenly becomes 10x more powerful for no reason and beats badguy that was untouchable 2 minutes before&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think Naruto does a much better job storytelling.  But still Bleach is great.  It's my 3rd favorite show after One Piece and Naruto.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-01-06, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking of AS, their really putting on quite the AFD lineup.<br />
<br />
First show gets replaced by a Chuck Norris cartoon.  Second show is the new episode of Ghost in the Shell, only with fart noises add.  Which is really immature, but it's still funny as hell cause the show is so serious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deltar Battlewall</div><div class="date">04-01-06, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must say, &quot;Assy McGee&quot; sounds really fake.  If  I had to guess that [as] was pulling an AFD joke, this would be it.  But, if anyone is going to really try and produce something this juvenile-sounding, I guess it would be them.<br />
<br />
All the other New Series sound fine on paper.  I'll check them out when I see them and make my decision then (never did catch that pilot ep of Lucy).<br />
<br />
As expected, [as] continues to make us love to hate them by renewing Tom, Squidbillies, and Mouse.  I take comfort in the fact that I no longer go out of my way to watch on Sunday nights because of these shows.  The downside to this is I think I'm also missing Stroker &amp; Hoop, which is an awesome show.<br />
<br />
Hooray for the return of Venture Bros!  :love  It's about time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amen :pray <br />
<br />
Robot Chicken got my attention quickly, I found Seth Green to be really annoying before this (despite how he seems to be working on everything before this). He is a good voice actor and producer it seems, just keep the regular acting out.<br />
<br />
And of course there are many other shows that are not AS funny as they were when they first debuted but they are still entertaining to watch. Overall, good to hear!</div></div><hr />

Mr. T (http://www.retrojunk.com/details_tvshows/510-mister-t/)<br />
<br />
I was up at 4:30 last night.. morning, and this came on CN.. by far one of the funniest attempts at a cartoon ever. I did learn many things though.<br />
<br />

Korgoth doesn't look too bad.  But he looks alot like the character is EXACTLY like the Brock Samson character from Venture Bros.<br />

And yes, Assy McGee looks ******* awful.<br />
<br />
And Saul of the Mole People looks SUPER awful!  I can't even decribe it.  It's like...it's like omg.<br />

On the plus side, new episode of Robot Chicken was tonight, and was hysterical as usual!</div></div><hr />
