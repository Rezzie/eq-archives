Don't stick your qtips in too far. But also don't be like my friend who thought he'd broken something cleaning his ears and was going deaf, then when he went to the doctors the doc just scooped out a lot of gunk from his ear that had sealed over it.<br />
<br />

Hey everyone else is doing it and it's sort of useful advice.</div></div><hr />

I mean, that's their sole purpose! Right? RIGHT?!<br />

She told me some junk about using them for chemistry stuff and cleaning other things. Bunch of poppycock!</div></div><hr />

Q-tips still rock.</div></div><hr />

If you have enough gunk in your ear to need to be cleaned out then sticking something in there will just shove the gunk in farther.<br />
<br />
And if your careful enough to not do that then how is a silky soft cotton swab supposed to scrub off the ear-wax?  Besides, your pinkey finger is just about perfect for that.</div></div><hr />

He went to the doctor for a gonorrhea test after a girl he was with called him up and told him she had it. <br />

He said they took one of the industrial sized, wooden handled Q-Tips and shoved it up his...<br />

They said he was clean and gave him a pill that was a one dose cure anyway.  I'd tell them to just give me the pill and keep the Q-Tip.  /cringe</div></div><hr />

I use Hydrogen Peroxide to flush, leave it in for about 5 minutes and then a QTip to dry.<br />

Dry QTips in the ear are useless. gnmish.gearbinder.ring.warden.sullon.zek<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rruen Blayde</div><div class="date">10-09-03, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know, it sounds wierd, but awhile back when I worked at GNC they sold these things called ear candles.<br />
<br />
At the time I had this HUGE, nasty ear infection. So instead of dumping a half galon of peroxide down the side of my face, (Let's face it, only a tiny bit ever really gets in your ear.) I gave these a go.<br />
<br />
It takes two people to do it. You lay on your side on the floor with your head on a pillow, then you poke the 'candle', which looks like a wax funnel cone, through this special shield and seal it firmly in your ear, then your friend lights the top of the 'candle' on fire. Every couple minutes they trim the ash off with a pair of junky, old scissors. (You're supposed to soak the scissors in bleach afterwards before using them for anything else.)<br />
<br />
I used two 'candles' on each ear. The very next day the infection was gone. Not even a slight ache remained.<br />
<br />
The most gross part about it was when we pulled the stub out of my ear, you only let it burn down to about 5 inches above your ear, and cut it open, there was this HUGE glob of the nastiest looking earwax you've ever seen.<br />
<br />
Crazy as it is, it really does work. <br />
Yes, that is a dagger in my pocket...<br />
No, I'm not happy to see you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kinare</div><div class="date">10-10-03, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whatever makes you feel better, but ear candles are a hoax. <br />
<br />
Try burning two ear candles down by the directions, in your ear. Compare them with two ear candles burned in a candle holder, burned the same way.<br />
<br />
Compare the insides of both candles. There is no physical way the candle can draw out ear wax. That is a myth.</div></div><hr />

Quote:After the first few uses, you might experience a slight irritation in your nasal cavity. This is a sign that the clearing of your nasal passages was a necessity.<br />
<br />
Golly gee beaver, sticking a glass tube up your nose filled with saltwater can cause irritation<br />
