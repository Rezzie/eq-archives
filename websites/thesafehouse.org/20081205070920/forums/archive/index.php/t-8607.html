<br />
Mainly I was wondering how much tougher the general would be to kill compared with Lodizal? ... I'm on the new stromm server so there arn't lots of high level players to help kill the general. My guild has recently been killing Lodizal quite a bit which is level 60 and hits for more than 250. If my guild can safetly, and easily kill Lodizal, would you think they can also kill the general? I think I read something about him harm touching for 800. How many players between 50-60 would you recommend having? I know the more the better, but what would be the fewest to safetly kill him?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not even the same ballpark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If he starts ping-ponging, game over.  He'll go right for the clerics after first heal lands.<br />
<br />
I must agree with Ddar, no competition between the two.<br />
<br />
A smart 60+ Shaman can solo Lodizal.<br />
<br />
Since you are on Stromm, I would get as many level 50+'s to come as you can.<br />
<br />
Probably a good opportunity for a General Party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_mengelt</div><div class="date">06-27-03, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions... Can ya recommend how many lev 50+ people it will take? Most of the guild now is around lev 55... If I had to guess I'd say we'll have 25 people total... 15 of them will be around 55, 10 will be around 52 and the MA will be 60 in a day or so... People in the guild do have experience with the general and seem to think we can pull it off... sound doable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Qutsemnie</div><div class="date">06-27-03, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can pull it off.  you can also fail badly.  the general is completely capable of killing that tank  (with im assuming a relatively low hp) before a CH can finish casting. (btw hes a procer is evasive better then defensive?) on the other hand he aint that hard.<br />
<br />
two things usually kill raids<br />
1) its usually the first hard(ish) melee you face and your raid is completely unprepared for the jump of in dps.  <br />
2) heal agro is a little intense.  either cause of some old world coding or cause he does more damage then tanks have agro i suspect the latter.   either way hes notorious for killing healers.  having a paladin that is ready to take agro if the tank falls is required for you.</div></div><hr />
