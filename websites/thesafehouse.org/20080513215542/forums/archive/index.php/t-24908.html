Right now I'm wearing 4/5 pieces of the blackend defias armor from the deadmines, the rest is just bits and pieces i've gotten from quests or vendors.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">indio</div><div class="date">01-10-07, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a pretty old post, but i'll stick my two cents in anyhow...<br />
first off, lvl 19 is pretty late to start grabbin gear for a 19 bg twink, i started on my rogue at lvl 10...being Horde, imo you should have been running Wailing Caverns, very nice pair of leggings (Legging of the Fang), a decent cloak (Lizardscale Cloak) and a nice bashy weapon with a poison proc serpent something cant recall the name.<br />
<br />
as for a rogue, i'd be on the lookout for anything with an Agi/Sta stat and slapping that on, Forest leather bracers are nice, Scouting gloves of the monky or agility are also good.  i also fished my ass off and entered the Fishing tournament in booty bay, got lucky and got my hands on a very nice hat with +15 stamina(Lucky Fishing Hat).  if your not into fishing, i'd take up engineering, get to 150 and make yourself some Green Tinted Goggles.<br />
<br />
my rogue is alliance so i got lucky and got me a Tunic of Westfall, pretty nice piece of chest armor, as for boots i went with the Feet of the Lynx, belt i went deviate scale belt which was pretty cheap considering i got the mats for the belt myself and had a guildie slap it together for me.  well anyhow, good luck with your rogue and if your still running in the 10-19 bg's im sure we'll run into each other somewhere out there.<br />
<br />
BTW, a very nice site with names and locations of twink rogue gear is on www.shadowpanther.net nice site and easy reference to thottbot.</div></div><hr />
