I just noticed that your light source no longer goes out when you hit water.    That used to be annoying to have to re-equip something all the time because apparently my Water Sprinkler of Nem Ahnk goes out when it hits.. water.</div></div><hr />

So when do you think they will fix the getting attacked thru walls thing fixed, or the mob escaping thru the wall trick, or your 40th level and trying to camp and some lowbie green orc pawn comes up and whacks ya. etc...<br />

Swarm Mother rips YOUR torso apart for 88 damage!<br />
Swarm Mother recycles YOUR leg for 67 damage!<br />
Swarm Mother eviscerates YOUR hand for 93 damage!<br />
Swarm Mother tried to take off YOUR head but misses!<br />
Sawrm Mother takes off YOUR head for 72 damage!<br />
You have had your arse kicked by the Swarm Mother!<br />
Returning to home point....<br />
LOADING... PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
Now I don't get a rats arse about exploiting or anything, it is NOT REALISTIC for the swarm mother to be able to hit me from there. I don't care if she friggin king kong'ed up the side of the building, there were at least 3 or 4 guards around. I didn't see them owning her through any walls.<br />

Bah. My rant for the day.<br />
