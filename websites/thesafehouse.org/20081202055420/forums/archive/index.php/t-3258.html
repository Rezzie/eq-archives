<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TheCountofThree</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played the whole first day without patching and never came across any bugs.<br />
<br />
Patched and went 3 days of multiplayer with no bugs.<br />
Crashed once when there was about 14 people fighting in one area with balor being chain summoned by the dm, someone was casting weird and I shapechanged into a red dragon. It just froze, but I wasnt that surprised. Turned out it was just that server, since I froze again the next day there. Never had any problems in any other one.<br />
<br />
Never had anything get corrupted or crash while I was in the builder, and I spent a lot of time there trying to figure stuff out. <br />
<br />
I almost didnt buy it when some moron mentioned how it was &quot;unplayable due to all the bugs and horrible coding&quot;.<br />
<br />
In fact, the only thing I can find wrong with it, is that its hard to see dragons until youre on top of them because of the camera angle. And by then its too late..</div></div><hr />

Otherwise the game has been rock stable for me. Something I'm not used to playing Verant products.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The really bad part is the toolset.  Buggy to all heck, but they're slowly but surely patching it (that corruption fix was very relieving)</div></div><hr />

Seems like every day i click on a skeleton i'm workin on or another mob and WHAM invalid page fault.  *sigh* good thing I save every 30 seconds.
