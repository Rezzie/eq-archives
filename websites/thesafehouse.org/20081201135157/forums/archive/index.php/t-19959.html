<br />
it's cool to hear that the combat chains may not be group-dependant too (though it sounds like they can be)... that was one thing that really hurt the pickup group in eq2... too complicated group interaction, yet it was necessary to be able complete a lot of encounters<br />
<br />
When solo fighting, the rogue will be able to stealth but then won’t be able to go back into stealth mode during the rest of the combat.<br />
<br />
this is my only concern... it's basically the reason why rogues can't solo... i always hoped that even eq1 would smarten up and give this ability to rogues... it's really no more overpowering than FD for monks and makes soloing a tough mob at least slightly possible</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can he BE any more vague. :p j/k any new news is good news. Thanks Darrin!<br />
<br />
I'd be lying if I wasn't quietly disappointed in the apparent waving off of our signature non-combat abilities... those sneaky &quot;thief&quot; ones ya know.  :hmph I know it's still early to be overly judgemental.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping for good solo play too and was told that rogues will be able to solo as well as any of the other light offensive classes so we'll see how it goes.<br />
<br />
Perhaps when we see gameplay in the big picture though we won't need to solo as much and/or soloing will still be enjoyable even if we only get one shot at using our stealth abilities.<br />
<br />
Nocte, I too hope to see some sort of non combat bonus skill added even if it's just for roleplay flavor. Still plenty of time for them to think about it, rogues aren't Beta0 yet from what I hear.</div></div><hr />

With a specialisation into Heavy Breather class?   :)</div></div><hr />

Just the infiltrator in DAoC, but I duel boxed in DAoC so I was not focused on him.  I certainly intend on trying all the classes thouroghly before release, but I am really prone to playing a rogue because, well they just seem really fun, in general, let alone in VG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's right, come on over to the Dark Side! ;)<br />
<br />
Hmm that flows right into Therian's comment too if you think about it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">08-13-05, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we can hope that whatever 'rogue' ends up being, it'll be interesting and fun.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping the same thing about Summoner, tho I've my doubts after speaking with devs at fanguard. Might have to go back to rogue! :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
This issue walks a very fine edge.  In EQ, rogues had serious problems soloing mobs because they couldn't restealth.  Rogues in WoW, however, can restealth during combat, and this allows them to solo single mobs far better than most other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatiana C</div><div class="date">08-16-05, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really because the better use of vanish is when you are in a party to keep the mob agro on someone :)<br />
<br />
Well I think we will need to see the gameplay in beta to have a better idea of VG rogue because for now it is still confusing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the interview :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">08-22-05, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're welcome Tatiana!<br />
<br />
Wow! Hey Vagan!! (Sorry for the late reply, been out of town).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">injijo</div><div class="date">08-22-05, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darrin expanded on fighting styles, “Rogues will be able to do dual or one handed fighting.” One handed is a defense option for a rogue it specifically means that there is a weapon in the main hand and a small buckler or parry weapon in the off hand. <br />
Fencing! Hurray!<br />
<br />
When solo fighting, the rogue will be able to stealth but then won’t be able to go back into stealth mode during the rest of the combat.<br />
Am I reading this wrong?  People seem excited about it(maybe I'm reading people's responses wrong, I am really tired), but it seems just like eq1.  Stealth in, backstab, get beat down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">08-22-05, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a one-on-one fight it's kind of difficult to lose track of your opponent, so not being able to restealth solo isn't a shock to me.<br />
<br />
Let’s say that the rogue gets the attack: Slice at level 10. It does good damage normally and great damage when it is used from a flanking position.<br />
This is what I'd be a bit concerned about.  If a mob auto-centers, a solo rogue would never be able to get to the flank to deal the 'great damage'.  Maybe there should be an 'expose flank' power where for the duration of the power you can make flanking attacks from the front, or an automatic chance to land the flanking damage even while in front of the mob (a 'critical strike', where you may have been able to get an attack under the armpit even though you were face-to-face with the mob).<br />
<br />
My fear is that if they put in too many 'group specific' damage situations, when they go to balance rogues they may end up nerfing both the solo and grouping aspects of a power because the group damage is too much.  It's great to be wanted in a group, but it's another thing altogether to absolutely need a group.</div></div><hr />
