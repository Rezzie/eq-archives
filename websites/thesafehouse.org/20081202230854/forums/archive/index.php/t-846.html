<br />
I think it's quite the opposite.. her relation could be the only thing that will actually *get* her a (at least big) career. I mean, we are reading and talking about her right now because of who she is, not what she can or can't do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vindicor</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good thing she's not planning on making it in the US, though.  We've all seen how little it takes for the sheep-like throng of America to turn against entertainers for stupid stuff (no, I'm not talking about molesting young boys, but rather, political affiliations and the like).</div></div><hr />

Puh-lease. Capitalism works that way friend. My money goes where I want it to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damned straight.  I do not care about the performer's political leanings, what flavor of pudding they like, what type of car they drive, or whether they drink Sprite.<br />
<br />
They are there to preform.  Not bore with with their life story.  As soon as they think they are important beyond the music/acting/whatever, they need to get a new job.  I am not saying they can't express their opinion, but when they act like their opinion means more than someone else just because they are a &quot;star&quot;, they need to take a long walk off a short pier.<br />
<br />
I am not paying them the .000001 cents per CD I buy to hear what their personal opinion is.  Save it for someone who gives a @#%$ (meaning the performer).<br />
