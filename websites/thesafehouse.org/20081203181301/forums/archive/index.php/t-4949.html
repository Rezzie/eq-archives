Being on a young server (euro server, less than 2 month old), I said to myself &quot;Thanak, big 2 O now, time to go gank some vickings&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I headed to Odin's gate, after about 30 minutes of sneaking around, I stumble across a group that was XPing. 2 big troll, purple con, 1 grey con healer... grey to a lvl 20 in RvR zone is asking for trouble, so I set myself to teach her a lesson.<br />
<br />
I close in, open with BS2 for 205 damage, deasised + weaken, didn't die right away but less than 25% life... follow up with thigh cut and finish her (ding 1 RP  ).<br />
<br />
Ok, so far so good, now time to get away... I sprint strait away from the 2 trolls mashing steath... soon as stealth pop in I make a 90 degree right turn... then bang 125,130,40,150, dead nightshade. <br />
 <br />
Any advice on what I did wrong (beside ganking while 2 purple con where around)... how do you guys get away after a kill ?<br />

You could have waited until the purples were low on endurance and then ran until out of end then stealth. Purples can see stealthers for a fair distance that is why just hitting stealth doesn't mean you'll get away. You need to hit stealth far enough away that they can't detect you then hit stealth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, the way the game is set up now, get used to dying after kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">03-11-02, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh. I tend to die about 2.3 seconds after my first hit. That is how long it takes archers to make me a pincushion. <br />

But oh how they squeal when I poke them myself. =)</div></div><hr />

I tend to get nuked into oblivion.  Sometimes, when I'm lucky, I don't get mezzed or stunned first. It's embarassing to get mezzed or stunned from the back (running away), then have a mage walk around in front of you and cast a nuke in your face. Aurra Sing - 38 Infiltrator<br />

<br />
Best (and easitest) thing to do is to travel with a group or partner. You don't have to make the kills with them, just so that they are near by and you can grab some speed help from them.<br />
<br />
Don't have a partner? Then do what I do which is see who else is a realm mate in the area. Strike up a short conversation just to know where everyone's at, friend and foe. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">03-19-02, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">purples will be able to see you if they are still close to you when you go stealth due to level difference.<br />
<br />
Never run in a straight line when you are being pursued.  All you need is stealth to go active and to get a bit away so they lose target.  But they only lose target if you are outside of the radius for their level disparity with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">03-20-02, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I almost always run in a straight line while trying to get away, at least until I stealth.  I find that people have far too much faith in Newton (Objects in motion tend to stay in motion) and tend to go searching where I would be if I had kept running.<br />
As a side effect, when a stealther disappears on me while I'm chasing, the one place I never look is the direction they were headed in. <br />
Also, when hiding after a kill, don't use cover.  What trees and the like do is provide searchers with a convenient list of spots to check.  The chances of them stumbling upon you in open terrain is much less than if you hug a tree.  I don't think I've tried it, but I think I could get away with a 180 degree turn upon restealth and running back through the pursuers.  Because stealth won't update for 3 seconds, they ought to be past you by the time they would have been able to see you.. (This wouldn't work very well if they're higher con than you I would imagine)<br />

I had at least 2 or three people in pursuit of me and I ran a basic straight then zig zag, then straight, then zigzag, until I could pop stealth back on and then move in a completely off-norm direction.  This was in the 30-35 bg, and I was lvl 31.<br />
<br />
I don't use trees unless I'm stalking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_JammStix</div><div class="date">03-27-02, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that in the BG I like to hunt on the hill right at the Keep (or I did until we took the middle keep).  Problem with the hill is that if you miss the 1 shot you have a crowd chasing you most of the time.  I've found that people assume that you're going to run as far away from the scene of the crime as possible, so I like to run straight down the hill towards the bridge or water and as soon as I restealth, do a 90 for about 15 yards and then head straight back up the hill.  I've sat at the base of the keep wall many times to med and get back into the game.  People just don't expect you to go into the fire again on an escape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Grendl Nighthunter</div><div class="date">03-27-02, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In teh BG you would have probably escaped, but you were way outgunned in the normal frontier.  Why??? Like so many are saying, you were encountering purple mobs, who could probably see you at a decent range, and then tack on the fact that one was a nightshade, who could probably detect you at a FAR distance...  I am suprised he let you get that close to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kosmaul</div><div class="date">03-27-02, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;Getaway&quot; is one of the funnest parts of playing a Nightshade. It gets tough at times because you never know if an archer type is chilling out nearby that is going to pop you good (which there usually always is). <br />
<br />
I tend to scope my area out very well. I always head in a straight line away from the group of chasers to limit nukes, stuns roots etc. If I vear off too early I can find myself closing the escape arc. <br />
<br />
Before I stealth, I usually fake turn in a direction, stealth and head 90 degrees in other direction. Or, like Caith (sp) said above, head right straight back threw the group in a semi circle back to my kill. This sometimes nets me the rezzer of my victim while the other offensive types are running around looking for me. <br />
<br />
Another trick is to hide in dangerous areas, agressive mobs, near guards, or even up on the hill close to the Yggdra PF =)<br />

hehehe great escapes though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_cjmet</div><div class="date">05-28-02, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeap, most people search certain areas, and ignore others.<br />
I'm always in the other.<br />
<br />
In fact, this one bard kept patroling the same route over and over around his group.  well, I picked a nice spot way away from his group, just stood and waited.  Sure enough, his patrol route didn't deviate even 1 step, I just press /stick PA as he walks right into it.  It was a long fight, as all bards are long fights, but 4 hits later he's dead and his group hasn't even moved yet.  I hit afterburner the other direction and then stealth away. (and yes a PA and 4 hits is a long fight with a hostile group nearby)<br />
<br />
I also love groups that put 4 stealthers out front to protect against assasins, but don't have any in the rear watching the backdoor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ogawa</div><div class="date">05-30-02, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love running straight out and turning in once I stealth. I think the best part of playing a NS is getting into the other guys heads. They always chase in the direction I was headed when I stealth.<br />
<br />
Last night I was watching a group of mids hugging the bridge. I couldn't' get in to them. So I stood 50 ft from the bridge, unstealthed and ran away in a straight line for 10 feet and restealthed. They went charging after where I was headed. I had made a 135 degree turn and was behind them hitting the caster sitting at the bridge mouth. I was then over the bridge and medding in the middle of the river.<br />

Suppose your buddy attacks and he hadn't told you he was attacking. You see him running away and sure enough the victim's friends are all lining up to shoot your friend. <br />
I've found that if you then unstealth for around 2-3 seconds, some of them will try to switch targets and hit you instead....which they can't because you'll stealth back right away but it'll basically make them lose their shot/spell.<br />

When we run, we run straight, and go right through the other stealthed SB. This way, you have a caster chasin you to get a mez/root/stun/nuke/whatever off, you've got 2 dead casters instead of a dead caster and a possibly dead SB.</div></div><hr />

Sorry dude.  Run till you run out of end, stealth and move a bit, then sit for a bit stealthed and high-tail it outta htere.</div></div><hr />
