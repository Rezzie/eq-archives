Do they show up on the world map or do I just have to find them?<br />

Is there a list anywhere of instances and intended level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">08-14-04, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they all start around level 20 and up.  First one for the Alliance is the Deadmines/Van Cleef I believe.   For horde I'm pretty sure it's the Wailing Caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lurik Crim`Tal</div><div class="date">08-14-04, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Thwick.  I found the list of dungeons on the WoW site.  I was at Deadmines last night but there was no blue swirling entrance area like the WoW site says to enter.  I'll try again tonight though.  Must you be grouped to enter an instance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">08-14-04, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, you can run em solo.   Let me be more specific, inside the Dead Mines in the entrance to Van Cleef, the instanced zone.  sorry bout that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bondori</div><div class="date">08-15-04, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alliance have all the good zones, at the moment, and that includes instances.<br />
<br />
WC is the first instance for Horde, and in my opinion one of the best. But everything after that is pretty crappy. The other one in Barrens in Razorfen Crawl, which is a piece of crap. That zone is so difficult that we couldn't go back and finish the quests we got at 16 until we were all 30+.</div></div><hr />

I did the first instance available to the alliance, Deadmines, 2 times last night.   Once we went all the way to the end boss and the second time our paladin and priest died right before the end boss and the two of us rogues that survived had no way to res them so we all had to pull out.<br />
<br />
I really underestimated the instances, this one was huge and took a couple hours to complete, really reminded me of a 1 group raid rather than an EQ dungeon grind.<br />
<br />
We crawled through, killed lotsa names, got lotsa loot, lots of fun.  There's not much in EQ I did that compares to it.  It was more like a raid because of how we had to keep moving deeper instead of set up camp and pull to it, but there was little downtime and a good amount of danger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never did complete it, had to end up abandoing the quest.<br />
<br />
Each time I had a different pickup group and each time we broke down at a certain point.<br />
<br />
It is kinda messed up.  Everybody solos for the most part and then they are forced to team up for the elite missions. The ability to share quest drops and goals is awesome though.  <br />
<br />
Are the higher level ones really far from the city? I can see some killer corpse runs.<br />
<br />
I have made atleast 5 attempts at gnomregan, knocking off a bit of each quest each time.  <br />
<br />
Is there an instance that isn't for elite quests?</div></div><hr />

He is a bitch man.  The first run everyone but our pally wiped at Mr. Smite, the giant Tauren hater that guards the entrance to the boat.   Pally and Mage ran, mage died and pally finally got safe, res'd in the mage and they had to fight back to our corpses and res.   We took down VC after we worked up the boat.<br />
<br />
The second run we decided to go around the right side of the boat which appeared to have some buggy aggro, something like 3 of the casters and 2 melees kept jumping us for no apparant reason and all our ressers wiped while I sprinted and the other rogue vanished.   I coulda used a Vox res stick :(</div></div><hr />

But there are areas populated by elite mobs that aren't an instance. That Dun castle place in Tarren Mill comes to mind, although I can't remember its name at the moment.<br />
<br />
Instances are always more fun though, because you have the entire thing to yourself and you know the bosses will be up :)</div></div><hr />

J<br />
<br />
It's the complete opposite of EQ.  I can't explain why and I'm not even sure why.  There are static 'dungeons' with elites and named mobs, the most I'm familiar with are mines and castles/strongholds.<br />
<br />
I've never seen them camped though.  When people want to do them or have a quest for them they get together and group, clear it and bounce, no sticking around for respawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">08-20-04, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So if say someone enjoyed setting up shop in one camp spot vs crawling is that viable in the non instanced dungeons.<br />
<br />
I really like to do crawls but my cleric partner really likes to camp a camp so to speak, was hoping WOW catered to both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be possible to 'camp' something, but it's useless.  Since battles are so quick and downtime is so short you'll be sitting in that are at full health with not to kill for a good 5 minutes before you get respawns.  <br />
<br />
Also, you can't pull from very far away back to camp because mobs will simply stop chasing you and go back to their posts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Multiple bosses and nameds in every instance.<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head, in the Stockades which is a very small instance in comparison to Deadmines there is:<br />
<br />
Bazil Thredd<br />
Dextren Ward<br />
Ham-Hock<br />
Kam Deepfury<br />
Tharg or something close- orc guy<br />
<br />
These don't drop loot though, atleast to my knowledge, they are quest kills, but they're definitely badass bosses.  Bazil is especially hard when she drops AE fears and then tears into your priest or mage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct, but most people dont notice it unless they get that quest, because it is underneath the rogue/warlock area of the city...which is in and of itself out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithiun</div><div class="date">12-17-04, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">crappy double post :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llamas</div><div class="date">12-24-04, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ragefire is probably my favorite of the horde instances, out of what I've done so far.  The quests range from level 14 to 16, I believe, and a full group of mid teens that knows its business can tear the place up.  I went in with a group of four, all of us 14-17 except for a 19 warlock whose pet did the tanking.  We ate the place alive, with the only deaths coming from the stupidity of one group member (don't fall off ledges into groups of mobs.  It's a bad idea).  I got about a level and a half out of it, between the exp in the dungeon and the 5 quests for it--two in Orgrimmar, two in Thunder Bluff, and one in UC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legna</div><div class="date">12-27-04, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I have found most the alliance instances to be pretty horrible. Both deadmines and the stockades were horribly done in my opinion, although I did have a good time doing Blackfathom. I rather enjoyed Razorfen, and loved Shadowfang keep. Scarlet Monestary was also amazing. <br />
<br />
We have done F'Z now and it was alright (although also very neutral) but nothing spectacular.<br />
<br />
Here is hoping that there are still plenty of good instances to find in the future.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chrisania</div><div class="date">12-28-04, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the instanced dungeons, there's lots of opportunity for quests and exp in them, and you don't have to worry about someone else 'camping' the instance.  VC wasn't bad, lots of fun to do the first time through, after that, its fun to walk n00bs through it &amp;lt;grins&gt;.  <br />
<br />
(( STOP READING HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TIPS FOR VC INSTANCE ))<br />
<br />
The trick to Mr. Smite is to first kill all of the stealther mobs on the platform where the chest is (2, I believe), then pull him back onto the bridge as far as possible, and kill all of the guys that come with him before you start to kill him... at 2 or 3 points during the battle (I believe 75%, 50%, and 25% life) he stomps (semi-AE stun that hits all the party members despite range) and runs back to the chest to change weapons.  Pulling him well back onto the dock means that it takes enough time for him to run back to the chest for his weapons that by the time he gets back, you're not stunned any more, and can be ready to fight again.  <br />
<br />
As far as VC himself goes, have your highest level rogue go into the hut where he is, and sap (or ambush) one of the stealther mobs to the sides of the doorway to start the fight, and kill the rogues before you start on VC.  When he hits 50% health, he calls two more stealther buddies into the fight, it's best to have a tank ready to pull them off of whoever they aggro, and then kill them before finishing VC off, as they have much less health, even in his weakened state, and combined, do more damage than him.<br />
<br />
(( END HINTS ))<br />
<br />
Also, in Gnomeregan, at the bottom of the instanced section is a mob which drops (possibly every time) a unique blue named dagger, called Toxic Ravager, that is 20+ dps 1.9? spd, and has an AE poison (5% strike chance) effect.  A high level guildie killed him while I was outside the instance, and all I had to do was join the party, go inside, stealth up and jump off the edge to where he was in order to pick up the dagger (I did this at 27 or so, which is about the level of the dagger).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legna</div><div class="date">12-30-04, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is strange.<br />
<br />
We killed the head of shadowfang and it dropped a robe. We had a mage join the group and dash in, he was unable to loot it. Loot was even set to FFA, but didn't matter.<br />
<br />
Glad it worked for you though. Also, the dagger doesn't drop every time, and that isn't the bottom of the instance. :) The caster boots seem to be more common, but I am already too far past it to go back and test it. <br />
