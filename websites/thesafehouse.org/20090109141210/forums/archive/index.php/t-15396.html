<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arakasi</div><div class="date">11-15-04, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I take back everything I ever said bad about Sony and EQ2 before it being released. Was playing a bit with my Scout today, got him to level 7 and had TONS of fun. Talk about an immersive world. EQ is still the master as far as I'm concerned (regarding EQ2, of course). I had a blast playing and it was reminiscent of my EQ days in classic when I was having fun in EQ. I haven't touched WoW yet, but it looks like fun as well, but in all honesty I've been too busy playing EQ2.<br />
<br />
I am curious, however, as to how EQ2 and WoW will hold up in the high end game. I can't take it for face value, even though EQ2 seems great on the surface I'm really curious as to if I will be enduring rather than enjoying when it comes to the high end. EQ2 seems to have a lot of things that WoW is missing (from what I've seen of WoW), and in the end, WoW just looks like the same thing EQ1 has become when it comes down to the high end game. For some reason though, I find it hard to imagine EQ2 becoming boring. The quest system is awesome, and fairly rewarding and they've seemed to have made rogues a very powerful class in their own rights, and fun to play at the least. It runs suprisingly smooth as well, which I thought it would take at least 2-3 months before it would run not even half as good as this knowing Sony's track record. Unless WoW has some major things to pull it way far ahead I think I'm going to have to throw my chips in with Sony and EQ2. <br />
<br />
That is, of course, as long as I hear good things about the higher end portions of the game.</div></div><hr />

It's awesome so far, but what about later down the road?  I mean, I've yet to even leave Antonica. How can you get to the other islands? I'm definitely enjoying it now and got my roommate hooked as well, but we'll see.</div></div><hr />
