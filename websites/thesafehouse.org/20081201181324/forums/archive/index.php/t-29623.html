<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GoatR</div><div class="date">04-22-07, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just bought the &quot;Pre-Order&quot; to this game from Amazon.com which has always, in the past anyway, been a great place to buy stuff from.  However, this time I must say that they have let me down.  First I purchased the preorder, then I hunted hunt through the directions on where to find the Founders key (the directions told me to look the YourMediaLibrary) then when I get there I click the &quot;Download&quot; for the account key and it comes up blank.  WTF.  I believe that Turbine needs to kind of rethink the way they do thier pre-order delivery.  Vanguard's pre-order open beta delivery was so much smoother by going through Direct2Drive.com.  Now I will admit that after talking to the Turbine CS that it sounds like it was Amazon that messed it up, but why make this process so damn complex in the first place.  Anyway I suggest not buying the pre-order form Amazon unless you have no intention of playing the game right away.</div></div><hr />

I did my Pre-Order through Frys Outpost and got my key emailed to me. No problems.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GoatR</div><div class="date">04-23-07, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After speaking with both the Turbine and the Amazon.com CS people yesterday (Sunday) I got an email earlier today (dont know when exactly as I had to work) with the code.  Downloaded everything and am now getting ready to launch the game so it was only a temporary problem, but I am still a little annoyed at all the hoops I had to go through (btw it was Amazon.com that screwed up not Turbine).</div></div><hr />
