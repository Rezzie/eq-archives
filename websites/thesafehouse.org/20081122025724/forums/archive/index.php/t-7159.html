Since the pet buff portion of Elemental Empathy (level 52) lasts for 90 minutes instead of the 15 minutes of Burnout III, it would appear pretty useful. But Velious magician pants have Burnout III as a right-click, so it's not as globally useful as you might first think.<br />

<br />
The existing pet haste/buff spells are considerably more powerful at the high end ( 1:  Increase Attack Speed by 85% <br />
2:  Increase STR by 115 <br />
3:  Increase AC by 71 <br />
5:  Increase ATK by 75 ), but their duration is MUCH lower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Off the top of my head Necro, Shaman, Mage, Enchanter, Druid, and Beastlord all have equal or superior hastes for pets.<br />
<br />
At least I think so.<br />

<br />
From the September 4th, 2002 patch message:<br />
<br />
- The limit on the amount of haste that can be applied to a pet has been changed (aka. The Pet Haste Cap). The amount of haste that can be placed on a pet now scales with the level of its owner. The scaling occurs in a way that is consistent with how much haste a given caster can place on his own pet (using a Level 56 Magician as an example: The idea is that both Burnout IV and Muzzle of Mardu should be useful). <br />
<br />
That means that mages should always be able to use their best combination of buffs and items and not reach the cap.  At L56, that would be 76% haste, and by L62 and Burnout V, 96% haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Andur Ravenblade</div><div class="date">02-22-03, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd think that the haste cap is gone after that statement, but after parsing it seems at least with the older pets and epic their was stilla  haste cap as the ancient buff + muzzle did nothing over BO 4 and the muzzle (not to mention frenzy burnout, this is an AA by the way). If i remember correctly new pets had similar issues.<br />
<br />
I'd just delete this post the fact that someone actually complained because mage's got an aego of sort (combination of two spells he already had, and low level ones at that) is retarded. This shows just a complete lack of knowledge of a very basic part of the mage class. Makes me wonder even more about the marathon post, and whether most of the rogues posting in it knew what they were talking about.</div></div><hr />

In all seriousness, the new buffs are merely time savers, I doubt they will stack with the current Shield line so less spells and longer duration pet buff is the idea.<br />

This is Dazzler you're talking about.  Dazzler's posts, views, thoughts, and exclaimations in no way reflect those of the Safehouse or those of free-thinking rogues everywhere.  I think thats the mildest way I can express it without making a personal attack.  If you want to see what I mean, do a search on threads started by her.  I beg you not to judge rogues as a whole by the comments Dazzler makes. <br />

The 2 mages and enchanter were charming elementals, full haste buffs etc. Mobs were literally dieing in 8-10seconds (something like 2500+ DPS).<br />
