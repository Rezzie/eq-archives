<br />
He:  ROG 39th, TT primary, CSS offhand.  AC 760ish &amp;amp; much more 'uber' than I overall, much exp at UO-type games.<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I opened the fight with Weaken I and a stab, careful to being the one to accept the duel and not initiate it.  Opened from Sneak/Hide with a Backstab.  He resisted the poison.  We meleed a bit, I realized that I had just one wimpy blade, switched to regular weapons.<br />
<br />
At about 2 bubs, I dodged out of his view just long enough to sneak/hide and bandage to half while applying a fresh Spine Break.  I got behind him again and Spine Break stuck.<br />
<br />
He was circle strafing a lot but says he wasn't using backstab (I'd swear he got at least a couple of small ones in).  In the end, he did win, but I had him down to about 1 bub left.<br />
<br />
We re-dueled from max hp, this time I received buffs to make our AC much closer.  With similar tactics, but I wasn't able to slip away for bandages, and for a bit I was losing my extra Stab attack from front by having fingers on wrong keys for about 30 secs.  He won again, but this time I had down to probably less than 100 hp.<br />
<br />
I think, given the difference in weapons, combat skills and dueiling experience (he had tons) that I did not too bad.<br />
<br />
I, obviously, need to work on circle strafing but did I do okay for a dueling amateur? Lannella Legerdemain, 36th Dagger<br />

<br />
Big differnce in weapons, next time use a snare or slow poison.  Weaken doesnt have enough effect on ppl.  <br />
<br />
Also, I would take out that bloodclaw and use a SBD and get a snare in on him.<br />
<br />
Did ya disarm or fear him?<br />
<br />
next time let him play the offensive, once he charges you, do like a bull fighter and let him go by, then backstab him.<br />
<br />
In a rog vs rog dont even think about tryin to slink away and get bandages, concentrae on killin him.  Rodcet Nife Ring Warden <br />

DISARM! This is probably the least used, most useful PvP skill. Especially if he has 8 backpacks, because then he has to scrounge around trying to find his weapon while you smack him around a little. Disarm + Blind is killer, especially if you can time the Blind properly to be able to apply another one hehe. Also, when PvP'ing, you can backstab from the front if you time it just perfectly, that will throw them off their feet :)<br />
