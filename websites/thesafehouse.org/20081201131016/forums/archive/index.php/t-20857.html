<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trophimus</div><div class="date">10-11-05, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Japanese friends that has Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3. He uses an Action Replay to play it on my U.S. Gamecube. It is very fun and extremely easy to learn. The only problem is that it doesn't work on some Gamecubes even with the Action Replay. I'm not sure why it won't work on some systems, but I would want to know for sure before I went out and spent a pile of cash on the game and an Action Replay.</div></div><hr />

I'm like, 5 years out of date on gaming. But, wouldn't it be more sensible to get a mod chip thingy?</div></div><hr />

Mod chips would really only be for like PS2's....Gamecube can use a thing called &quot;freeloader&quot;....</div></div><hr />
