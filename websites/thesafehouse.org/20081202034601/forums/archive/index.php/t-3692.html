Is SWG going to be the same?  What have devs said, and what does the community know?</div></div><hr />

If it is like the rest of the content, it will just be an exciting way to get from boring Point A and boring Point B.<br />
<br />
Space PvP will be like the regular PvP.  Horribly unbalanced.<br />
<br />
I can see them adding a pilot class.  So the fighters will have to train for combat fighting, while the rest can shuttle hop, space farm spice with no training.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, it could be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but SWG has yet to prove itself without the expansion. <br />
 <br />
 It's only wrong if you get caught.If  consequences dictate my course of action I should play GOD<br />

<br />
if they bastardize it,then ill end up cancelling my account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The space system is probably going to be EXACTLY like the ground based game.  Only instead of animals popping of rock lairs you get tie fighters popping out of little space stations.  And of course you'll have a completely different skill set for when your in space. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bellia Stillheart</div><div class="date">11-02-03, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll only resubscribe to swg, if they made space combat totaly skill based. As in get a joystick out, and actually fly the ship, instead of click on _joeblows_slave1_ and just spam a stupid attack key.<br />
<br />
But we all know it'll be spam the stupid attack key..no need to add iin any fun to this game. Edited by: Bellia Stillheart at: 11/4/03 1:02 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Andurian</div><div class="date">11-03-03, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember the Devs saying repeatedly that Space will be &quot;twitch combat&quot; Like FPS's.<br />
Why wouldn't they, would be fun as hell and from their pov, mmorpg + fps = more money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">11-10-03, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I'll just go back and replay Tie Fighter.<br />
<br />
In fact, I wish more MMO games weren't RPGs.  I mean, how many FPS or Flight simulators out there have persistant worlds?  If SWG was just Jedi Outcast on the ground and Tie Fighter in space the game would have been infinitly more enjoyable than it is now. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />
