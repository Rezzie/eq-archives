 <br />
Looks great, Asuna even uses her card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-04-06, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While related, the Negima teaser that came out is for the OVA, not the TV series. It's the Spring Special DVD, and the Summer Special DVD will come out a month after it. They're really going all out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">09-04-06, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well pan-fry me in some creole spices and sell me for 7.99, I did not know that.<br />
 <br />
...damn, I wish that was for the new TV series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-04-06, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't count it out just yet - the OVA and new TV series are from the same studio. The studio making the new TV series is bragging pretty heavily about it, so you'll probably see similar high quality on the TV run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">10-07-06, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new negima animation is a lot better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">10-25-06, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shinsen is doing a joint release with newcomer Atavus, let's hope it improves over Mahora's.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Edit:<br />
Hrmmm, don't like a few of the translations, but oh well. <br />
 <br />
Damn, this show went nuts! The Azumanga reference on the blackboard had me rolling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">10-26-06, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay! A third subber has released, and it's the best of them yet. One noticible flaw, (rather large text) but it keeps Aniki and the the -chan. Hated 'Setsie'. That's freakin' retarded.<br />
 <br />
Looks like I'll be following Megami-Anime.<br />
 <br />
Ya know, upon second watch, it weirdly feels like Le Portrait Cossette...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">11-04-06, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched the first couple of episodes, I'm quite impressed with it n_n. I actually enjoyed the original Negima (apparently like the only person ever to have liked it :p), but this version is even better. Cant wait for more episodes to come out ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">02-25-07, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to dig up such a (relatively) old post, but now that this series has been going on for a while longer, anyone else still keeping up with it? I'm *really* enjoying it so far, every part of it. The art continues to amaze me (in ep 14, the whole &quot;falling&quot; sequence was, IMO, some of the best animation I've seen in a long time), the music continues to fit perfectly, and even the humor works well (the green dude cracks me up for some reason). Please tell me someone else is watching this... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-25-07, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still keep up with it. However, have you seen the Negima Summer OVA? The scene with everyone falling in that one was ten times better.<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying the series, but didn't really like it when Negima was turned into a CHubapacra. It was distracting and made me feel like &quot;hurry up and get back to the real story.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm becoming a big fan of Studio Shaft and director Akiyuki Shinbo. I really enjoyed his other works, Le Portrait de Petit Cosette, Hidamari Sketch, Pani Poni Dash, and Tsukuyomi ~Moon Phase~.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">02-25-07, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently caught back up with it. There's so much PPD-esque wierdness  that it almost distracts from what's going on.<br />
 <br />
I do like how more of the girls are getting screen time, tho. Nodoka and Asuna's personality changes are for the better.<br />
 <br />
Havent seen the OVA's yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-25-07, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The OVA's basically exist for fanservice. No story in particular. The first OVA is a swimsuit episode at beach. The second one is a bath episode. The first OVA has a lot of cool scenes though, like the skydiving, and the asuna battle sequence.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, very fun and disposable.</div></div><hr />

First OVA had good animation while the 2nd OVA had budget animation :P.</div></div><hr />
