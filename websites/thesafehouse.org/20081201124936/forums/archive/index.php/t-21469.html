<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">11-14-05, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I debated whether or not to mention this in the other thread, but thought it would be better outside of it because it's also a little bit of a general topic. And most who are not up to date are not reading the thread, I imagine.<br />
<br />
In any case, not only did One Piece get dropped from 4kids, Tokyo Mew Mew also did. I'm certainly not suprised that One Piece bombed due to the crap it got turned into. When you have no hardcore fans willing to keep it above the surface, and no mainstream fans to make profit, of course it's going to bomb. It might have done well with just hardcore fans, or at the very least, much better than it is doing now.<br />
<br />
At the very least, One Piece has a MUCH larger hardcore following than most anime on TV, AND those on DVD's. What a dumb ass move.<br />
<br />
With some luck, this means potentional for sublicensing. If Funimation, the most likely canditate, gets it, I will worship the ground they walk on. Here's to hoping that this is for the best, instead of the worst.</div></div><hr />

Really hoping Funimation picks up One Piece.  Hell, I hope they redo it all over again.</div></div><hr />

I'm still trying to figure out what people see in One Piece.</div></div><hr />

See, that's how bad One Piece's treatment was, it made you think what happened to Naruto wasn't &quot;that bad.&quot;  It's glass in the peehole, my friend.  Once it happens, you know rock bottom, and everything else is a vacation.<br />
<br />

<br />
It's a very fun show about pirates and friendship, filled with wacky adventures, and with lots of kickass fighting.  I guess it's not for everyone :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I hate the voice actor who plays Naruto. I also don't like how they didn't use Wind in the American version. I mean it's already a good song and on top of that, it's already in English!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-15-05, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fight scenes were cool, but the dialouge....egads. Not to offend anyone that enjoys it, but I feel like I'm watching at the 3rd grade level when I see that show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OpZO</div><div class="date">11-15-05, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No shounen has really great dialogue honestly. Just the character ensemble in One Piece is fantastic and the world is really immersive, things are going on all the time and it's completely nonstatic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I couldnt STAND the american version one piece, they just completely trashed the original animted show. Fan Subtitles will win every time! <br />
<br />
I really hope that one day cartoon netowork or someone similar can start screening One Piece as it was meant to be shown, instead of making a dumb down piece of crap like 4kids did....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err then your feelings toward One Piece are hereby irrevelant. :p<br />
<br />
One Piece USA being compared to One Piece Japan is like comparing, &quot;Dude, where's my Car&quot; to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.</div></div><hr />

/agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">11-15-05, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, even in the japanese version, Luffy and Usopp's dialog is pretty juvenile, but its still funny as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deuce</div><div class="date">11-15-05, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and sanji doesnt sound like a bloody buffoon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I'm not denying the childishness of the show, but rather implying that it's not as dumb and pointless and grotesque as the USA version. They are actually funny in the Japanese version, as you said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-15-05, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to quit watching Anime series on ******* cartoon network!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">11-15-05, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the problems is the show isn't really screened to air on CN, it's been screened to run on saturday mornings against shows like Xiaolin Showdown, Coconut Fred, and Yu-gi.</div></div><hr />
