<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-19-06, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's about time for the next season's anime thread. The last two got good response so I figure I'll keep it going. Spring 2006 anime begins technically April 2006, but some consider March stuff part of it. I'll include March 2006 because it's only three, anyway. You'll find a list of anime airing this season, my comments on what type of shows (that I'm familiar with, anyway) they will be. Feel free to add your own input.<br />
<br />
I'll also be reviewing titles as they come out as usual. There are over sixty (yes, 60) new anime series airing this Spring 2006, a record. Bound to find SOMETHING you like. I'll make the post with the dates in the second post, the third post will be my comments on series that are well-known or anticipated generally, Then in the fourth and last, the anime I am personally looking forward to.<br />
<br />
An overview of what to expect this season. There's a fairly good mix of anime this time. The emphasis continues to be on moe~ anime, but the darker crowd will find some good stuff. There's a few comedies. There does not appear to be a new shounen anime in the vein of Bleach, Naruto and One Piece (that's not to say there are NO shounen animes, just none as big as those three.)<br />
<br />
There doesn't seem to be any, or at least none significant, ecchi anime in the style of Girls Bravo (big breasts, etc). Plenty of moe though, if you're into that (lucky for me~) There's also a few bishoujo games to anime adaptations, and normal game to anime adaptations. Mecha anime seems to be continuing it's slump. <br />
<br />
A few fighting anime, the most notable being Air Gear, by Oh! Great who created Tenjho Tenge. If you don't want to read all the list, just skip to my post on the more well-known ones.<br />
<br />
Please don't spoil using raws, we'll talk fansubs-only. And no game spoilers too if you've played them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-19-06, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The more notable ones appear to be:<br />
<br />
4/01/06 - Soul Link (http://www.soul-link.com/top.html) <br />
Based on the game by NAVEL. In 2045, Aizawa Ryota went to a Military Academy which had been attacked by a terrorist group. It's a Sci-Fiction romance based on an Eroge. (Romance, Adventure)<br />
<br />
4/01/06 - BLACK LAGOON (http://www.blacklagoon.jp/)<br />
A man was on his way to SE Asia with classified documents where he was kidnapped by pirates in a submarine, Black Lagoon. Instead of being rescued by his company, they sent assassins to kill him so that he does not reveal company secrets. As a result, he joins Black Lagoon, a modern-day pirate crew with a submarine. Guns and mayhem! The animation is SUPER HIGH! (Action)<br />
<br />
4/02/06 - Himawari (http://www.starchild.co.jp/special/himawari/)<br />
In the town of Kasumi Kogen, (The village of the Mist [not Naruto]) there's a training school for ninja women. A girl named HImawari arrives, she wants to be a Ninja with Ichikawa Raiso as her master. A man also arrives to become a teacher to repay his debt. (Comedy, Romance, School Life)<br />
<br />
4/02/06 - ARIA the NATURAL(http://www.ariacompany.net/index2.htm)<br />
The second season continues for this slow-paced anime. The story revolves on a man-made planet that is created to resemble Veniece. Akari is training to become an Undine (boat rower). It's a really heart warming show and sometimes sad, but sometimes happy too. (Comedy, Drama, Slice of Life)<br />
<br />
4/02/06 - School Rumble 2nd Semester (http://www.school-rumble.net/)<br />
The second season of School Rumble continues the last season. It is mostly a slice of life comedy based in a High School. It has some very funny moments, and is sometimes compared to Azumanga Daioh, but it's not quite that similar. (Comedy, Drama)<br />
<br />
4/03/06 - Simoun (http://www.simoun.tv/)<br />
The story takes place on Great Air Continent, a different world.  In this world, people are all born female until they are 15, where they choose which sex to be as an adult. The story is somewhat confusing. The world is at war, and the country where Simoun cast is gets invaded by another country who wants their engine. It gets worse, and they convert a ceremonial plane into a fighter plane. I really don't understand at all, further review when it gets released... (Drama, Fantasy, Yuri)<br />
<br />
4/03/06 - Joshikousei GIRLS-HIGH (http://www.girls-high.net/)<br />
Eriko joins a very high-ranking all girls school. She was expecting a beautiful school like Maria-sama ga Miteru, but that gets changed when she finds out the lack of presence of men made the girls lazy and they start not caring about themselves. (Stalk's note: a fairly true statement, all-girls schools in reality is not what us guys think it is. They dress sloppy, don't take good care of their bodies, etc) (Comedy, Slice of Life, School Life)<br />
<br />
4/03/06 - Utawarerumono (http://www.utaware.net/)<br />
This is another game based on a doujin eroge. A man who lost his memory ended up in a strange land where he was tended by a woman with animal ears and a tail. He finds he has a mask on his face which he cannot remove. He deciedes to learn about the new world and try to find who he is. (my note: dog-girls, bunny-girls, cat-girls, horse-girls, you name it...) This is a very serious story, even though it's based on an eroge. You could say it's an eroge in the way Fate/Stay Night is, but the story's not similar at all. (Adventure, Romance)<br />
<br />
4/03/06 - Strawberry Panic! (http://www.strawberrypanic.com/)<br />
Another series set in an all-girls school. It's very Yuri. Making out, touching, etc. To say it's for guys would be an understatement. I've heard people describe it as Maria-sama ga Miteru with 80% less angst, 700% more sexuality. Yowza. (Yuri, Romance)<br />
<br />
4/04/06 - Gintama (http://www.sunrise-inc.co.jp/gintama/)<br />
At the end of the Edo period, aliens invade Japan! A war breaks out, Samurai (yes, swords, robes, etc... we're talking the old Japan era) deciede to fight, but many lost their lives. Earth surrenders, bans samurai from carrying swords. (Comedy, Sci-Fi)<br />
<br />
4/04/06 - Makai Senki Disgaea (http://akaitsuki.net/index.html)<br />
Based on the game by Nippon Ichi. The Prince of the Netherworld, Laharl, woke up and found that the land is in chaos after his father's death. With the help of his father's vassal, Etna, he sets out to take over the netherworld. (Action, Comedy)<br />
<br />
4/04/06 - Air Gear (http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/airgear/)<br />
Air Gear is about inline skating, but the skates can be customized. I.e. you can add engines, etc. They are on a quest to become the King of Air. (Action, Shounen)<br />
<br />
4/04/06 - Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (WHEN THEY CRY...) (http://www.oyashirosama.com/web/)<br />
Finally, america gets to see this classic! The HUGELY popular Doujin-game that took Japan by a storm last year. The red Na is important to the story, so I'm going to keep doing that. Most of us do it out of respect for the game creator. It's based in a small village with a population of 2000. One day, a murder case occurs! And he finds similar murders happend on the same day 4 years running! This game by 07th expansion which was made by a family. Yes, one man made it, the father did coding, the mother did marketing, etc. Incredible! (Drama, Mystery, Psychologicial Thriller) (Stalk's note: I'll expand more on this)<br />
<br />
4/05/06 - NANA (http://www.s-nana.com/)<br />
A story of two women who attempt to pursue their careers and love so they can become adults. Angst... (Drama, Romance)<br />
<br />
4/05/06 - .hack//Roots (http://www.hack.channel.or.jp/)<br />
Most of you should know the .hack story by now, so I shouldn't need to say much.<br />
<br />
4/05/06 - Witch Blade (http://www.witchblade.jp/)<br />
Based on the American comic.<br />
<br />
4/05/06 - RAY THE ANIMATION (http://ray.tv/)<br />
This anime appears to be based on the Black Jack universe. Black Jack is a well-known genius surgeron. One day, a woman got an eye transplant that gives her some sort of X-Ray vision. Because of this, she also becomes a really incredible surgeron. Fans of Black Jack would probably like this.<br />
<br />
4/06/06 - xxxHOLIC (http://www.tbs.co.jp/holic/)<br />
Based on a series by CLAMP. Watanuki has a curse where he sees evil spirits and attracts them. He meets Youko who can grant wishes, but she forces him to work for her until he has done enough to grant his wish. (Adventure, Action)<br />
<br />
4/06/06 - Ah! My Goddess 2nd Season (http://www.tbs.co.jp/megamisama/)<br />
This anime is the same as the first season. Keiichi was having bad luck, and misdails the Goddess hotline. As a result, Belldandy the Goddess comes to his house and grants him a wish. His wish was for a Goddess like her to stay with him, and their relationship begins. It's a heartwarming series about an relationship. But it's not fast at all, in 30+ volumes they've only kissed one or two times. So it's pretty fustrating. (Romance, Comedy)<br />
<br />
4/13/06 - The Third ~Aoi Hitomi no Shoujo~ (http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/fujimi/webage/thethird.html)<br />
Honoka happens to save a handsome man in the desert. He asks her to escort him to a forbidden place, Steel Valley. The world is taken by humanoids called The Third, and Honoka deciedes to face the mystery behind them in this barren world where the human race is becoming extinct.<br />
<br />
4/13/06 - Jyu Oh Sei (http://jyu-oh-sei.com/)<br />
Thor and Rai are twins who've been raised on a space colony. Their parents were killed and they were sent to a prision  world for terrible criminals. The world is divided into four by skin color Thor and Rai deciede to become Ju Oh, the King of the worlds in order to avenge their parents deaths. Believe it or not, it's a shoujo!<br />
<br />
4/29/06 - Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season (http://www3.nhk.or.jp/anime/tsubasa/)<br />
A series based on CLAMP, where many of the cast in various series appear. Drama, Adventure, Action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-19-06, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And now the last post. These are the series I am looking foward to, and why.<br />
<br />
Fushigi Boshi no Futago Hime Gyu!<br />
The second season of Futago-Hime. It's an cute and adorable anime about twin princesses of the Sun Kingdom who wish to change the world. I loved the first season, can't wait for this one.<br />
<br />
Black Lagoon<br />
Looks to be a dark and gritty anime with a lot of gunfights and action. The animation is reportedly INCREDIBLE. It'd be a good change from the lighter anime I've been watching lately.<br />
<br />
Aria the Natural<br />
Can't wait for this one, it's very sweet and calming. It makes me feel very relaxed when I watch it. Watching Aria in it's animation form is wonderful, it gives a deeper appreciation for the slowness than the manga.<br />
<br />
School Rumble 2nd Semester<br />
I found the first season to be full of great (and hot) girls, and I'm a sucker for this type of anime. It had it's funny moments. Can't wait.<br />
<br />
Utawarerumono<br />
It'll be nice to see this series. I don't know how many episodes it is, but the game was wonderful. I really can't wait to see it animated. The story is incredible and very engaging. It's made by Leaf. Can't wait.<br />
<br />
Strawberry Panic!<br />
Yuri, school, making out? Sign me up!<br />
<br />
Makai Senki Disgaea<br />
This should go without saying. Etna and Flonne *_* For the sake of love, please die!<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku koro ni (Alternative title, WHEN THEY CRY...)<br />
Oh man, I don't know what to say about this game. To call it a thriller isn't enough. It's ******* CREEPY. I mean, beyond ******* creepy. It's about serial murders. Oh man, I don't know where to begin. People die bloody deaths here. I cried a few times :( Man I really really really can't wait for this anime.<br />
<br />
I'll watch anything that gets fansubbed, as usual, and give reviews, but those are what I'm most looking forward to.</div></div><hr />
