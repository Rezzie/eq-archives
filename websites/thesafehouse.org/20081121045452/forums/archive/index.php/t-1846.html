<br />
It doesn't appear to be on, I'll turn the monitor on. Oh what's that, it turned on? Oh well, saves finding the towe...what?<br />
<br />
Someone stole the buttons off the mouse. I thought this was a -safe- campus, but we've got vandals thieverizing the very buttons off the mice!<br />
<br />
They're on the side? Who the hell has hands compatible with this thing?<br />
<br />
Shift+home and end don't highlight text. Pgup/down ignores my form field and scrolls the entire damn thing. If the mice actually worked worth a @#%$ I wouldn't mind. Hell, shift and arrow keys doesn't work for highlighting text. There's no mouse wheel. Whoever set the settings for these computers must have motion sickness, because I could run over to the cafeteria and buy lunch in the time it takes to move the cursor across the screen, either by mouse or arrows.<br />
<br />
Dear god, it's an iMac. I thought these things were extinct. The only nice thing about it is the size and pressure required of the keys on the keyboard. Do they make an iMac-&gt;pc converter for these?<br />
<br />
Oh well, they say you can play games on them.  There's a first time for everything, I suppose. Even Yahoo! games don't work with them.<br />
<br />
I wonder which genius put the napster installer next to the text on the wallpaper that says &quot;NO ILLEGAL DOWNLOADING, SUCH AS BUT NOT LIMITED TO MUSIC, MOVIES, AND SOFTWARE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll buy an iPod and be like one of those kids in Hackers and skate out of the building with my pirated trojans.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm tired of the window scrolling away when I hit end. Time to post and get the hell away from this.<br />

Those aren't buttons on the side. The whole thing is the button! Jumping failed engineering students on a springless pogostick, batman.<br />

See, when you use a computer so innately that it works and you don't even realize what your hands are doing, you use computers too much.<br />

ps: i liek 2 b able to edit text without having to take my hand off the keyboard to move the @#%$ thing faster than a snail moonwalking down an upward escalator while frozen to within 30 Kelvin of absolute zero.</div></div><hr />

Cute chick: Can you help me? It just froze up.<br />
Me, thinking: @#%$ IMACS<br />
Me, saying: *mumbling while @#%$ with the keyboard* ask the IT guy<br />
IT guy: You just have to turn it off. They're crap. That's why they're in the free surf zone.<br />
Me: Why do we have imacs anyway?<br />
IT guy: They gave them to us for free when the college opened<br />
Me: figured.<br />
<br />
Today:<br />
Several of us: Macs suck<br />
Woman using one nearby: This isn't like at home. Do people still use these?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ass remains sore, shakes have stopped. Sweats are going away. Satellite television is frightening (Thank you, Satellite! 'Tasty Asians 2: Poo Poo Plater' is utterly horrific to see mentioned while channel surfing after witnessing the horrors of the internet.) DSL kit not to arrive for another 4 days at the minimum. Jacuzzi is nice. Morons who installed my bathroom failed to put in an exhaust pipe for the gas; opening bathroom door floods house with the permiating stench of rotting, ancient feces. Shower head faces curtain and bathroom door, resulting in potential hilarity if someone you dislike barges in, but also great potential for rotting the god damn floor out. Thankfully, the guano-vampire/mummy scent keeps us all out of that room.<br />
<br />
The apple next to me is borked. In fact, even the power switch is non-responsive. A hammer would resolve that issue, but I don't think that'd make me popular. While searching for loose cords, I discovered that these things have handles on them. It's like Tickle Me iMac.<br />

... I believe the term is &quot;flush&quot; ..! although a bathroom without a ventilation system seems really really weird, so maybe it doesn't help anyway  <br />

It helps, but it is not within normal operating perameters for a toilet to require 10 flushes a day to maintain a rosey, generic faded piss/crap public bathroom scent* instead of smelling like count zombula after a scene of scat porn. It's unusable at 5 flushes a day. Definitely not right.<br />
<br />
As for green toes... I had rotting flesh occur on my toe a couple of times. I pulled the area open with a cottonless q-tip and poured peroxide and alcohol on it til it went away. Flesh was all soft and gooey.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*It's bad when you wish your home bathroom smelt as good as a public restroom. I've never actually flushed it 10 times a day, I'll have to try it.</div></div><hr />
