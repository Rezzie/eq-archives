<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">03-16-04, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The official website for Vanguard: Saga of Heroes has become fully operational. The official game description is also revealed and we have concept art obtained from Sigil.<br />
<br />
Eagerly and curiously anticipated, Sigil has decided to officially let the world know about their game, Vanguard: Saga of Heroes through the unveiling of their website (http://www.vanguardsagaofheroes.com/) (not just the teaser anymore) and release of an official description of the game. <br />
Here is their official description:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes is a High Fantasy themed Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) with a heavy focus on character development, an immersive world and player interdependence.<br />
 &lt;/p&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine a vast, detailed world of swords and sorcery, of dragons and knights, of fiery swords and chests overflowing with treasure… a world in which a myriad of sentient races and creatures, many upon which players will be able base a character, live and affect change. A place where the characters players create can follow very different paths of advancement, including assuming the roles of adventurers, crafters, merchants, and more.<br />
 &lt;/p&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The goal of Sigil Games Online is to make Vanguard: Saga of Heroes the premier third generation massively multiplayer RPG. To meet the growing demand for a game that advances the multiplayer fantasy genre, Sigil is using the combined experience and creativity of its team to bring players a new and challenging feature set with deep, involving game content. Vanguard is prepared to lead the way in subscription based revenue games.&quot;<br />
 &lt;/p&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Curioser and curioser as Alice would say. The Safehouse of course will be bringing you the latest news that we can wring out of a certain gnome on our staff... um I mean that we can obtain through completely legal means.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to consolidate this information, we will be opening a Vanguard dedicated wing to The Safehouse. But for now enjoy these concept art shots from Sigil Games Online: Drake (http://www.thesafehouse.org/~fricka/vanguard/Drake1.jpg) , Salamander (http://www.thesafehouse.org/~fricka/vanguard/salamander1.jpg) , Castle New Targonor (http://www.thesafehouse.org/~fricka/vanguard/CastleNewTargonorColorFlat.jpg)<br />
&lt;/p&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
ok so that was expected, still had been holding out that they might try to branch out into something else.<br />
<br />
Very nice concept art though. I'm sure the game will do very well. I've jsut become a bit jadedI guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was praying for Shadowrun, or at least maybe Earthdawn.<br />
<br />
And I'm still pissed about the Aradune transfer thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what Aradune transfer thingy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They posted a dumb little story about how Aradune came to find himself on this new world thingy.<br />
<br />
It reminds me of when a gamemaster keeps bringing back the same NPC's, who were all old PC's of his or his friends at some point.<br />
<br />
If you're making a break from EQ, I want a clean slate damnit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">03-25-04, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh like he was going to get rid of Aradune. Apparently it's an old D&amp;amp;D character of his who followed to Meridian or some other mud, then into EQ. he's like my old DM's &quot;Bob the bartender&quot; he in every campaign, no matter what setting it is heh.</div></div><hr />
