<br />
Any help would be appreciated, thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SenecatheStoic</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, found out that the quest NPC is different for each archetype. Ours for medium armor, all Scout classes in FP is an NPC by the forge on the right as you walk into the bow and arrow shop in East FP. He's the only non-merchant in there, as far as I can tell. Sorry I didn't remember the name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">torvrogue</div><div class="date">12-11-04, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It must be differerent in Freeport then, in Qeynos at least both heavy and medium armor come from the same guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganglia</div><div class="date">12-21-04, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Medium and Heavy same place.  Dyric Pine in EFP.  Probably speeled that wrong but he is in the shop right across from the WFP entrance.</div></div><hr />

While the quest are not hard, finding a group to go through them with if your guild is based in pansyland will make them harder.<br />
<br />
AQ1 is based in Commonlands and is very easy.<br />
AQ2 and AQ3 are in fallen gate so you will need access to this zone and alot of patience as this is not a zone that forgives pickup group mistakes.<br />
AQ4 will be the hardest as its in Edgewater Drains with is under serpent Sewers which is under the Thieves Way so getting a group here is going to be hard due to no one going into the zone lol.<br />
AQ5 and AQ6 take place in Nek Forrest and can be done in best part of a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mideon</div><div class="date">01-06-05, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only difficulty involved in the armor quests is patience.  If you had a steady group and everyone needed the AQs, you could do em all in 2 days.  Personally I'm on AQ6 and all I need is 19 dragoon sentries to finish but nobody ever camps those in particular and the group I got the rest of the quest done with was a step ahead of me when I joined.</div></div><hr />
