<br />
Anyone using poisons on high end raids?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Frostdagger</div><div class="date">10-07-02, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not much aggro on poisons from what Ive seen, the only downside is that Ive never seen a poison that sticks on a boss mob. a while back I was going to compile some research as far as mobs and zones that poison can be effectively used on raids, then I figured why bother.<br />
<br />
I have gotten poisons of many sorts to stick on wurms/drakes in west and north ToV, and on yard trash in fear, aside from that I havent really tested raid level encounters with poisons all that much. <br />
<br />
On a side note I have never gotten aggro from a poison going off, the only thing I have trouble with aggro from is my trident proc, and thats negligible if Ive already evaded a few times. I dont really have to worry unless it procs in the first 15 seconds or so of a fight.<br />

<br />
I've always liked spears and tridents but for the life of me I cannot think of any that an Assassin should/would be useing. Sure, I'll break out my Trident of the Seven Seas occasionally for grins and giggles but that's about it.<br />

Proc is a 500 point dot over 25 ticks and 10% slow which fires off quite often and is overwritten by other slows, which also block its effect.<br />
