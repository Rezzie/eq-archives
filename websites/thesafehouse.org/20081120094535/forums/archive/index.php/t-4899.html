<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dragmal</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'm making a shadowzerker but I'd like to blow off envenom and repleace it with CS. Now I'm only level 6 atm (I have 20ish shade and ranger as well) but I was playing w/ cbuilder at catacombs and I have a few questions. I know the answers are on the boards but w/ the search function being offline I figured someone could give me a few quick answers.<br />
<br />
How high do most people take LA?<br />
<br />
Is the 29 (snowsquall) and 44 (icy brilliance) LA chain better than the PA, CD, SS critical chain?<br />
<br />
Right now I'm looking at either of these templates based on which chain is better:<br />
<br />
If LA is better,<br />
Stealth: 40<br />
CS: 34<br />
LA: 44<br />
Axe: 33<br />
<br />
If CS is better,<br />
Stealth: 40<br />
CS: 39<br />
LA: 39<br />
Axe: 34<br />
<br />
The CS temp is more balanced but I'd rather have the LA damage if the LA chain is better. Do you think my axe skill is high enough? With items and RP's I figure I should be alright.<br />
<br />
Any comments or suggestions are welcome and wanted.<br />

You're just making a balanaced assassin, and it looks great to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dragmal</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is more of a balanced assassin but in the early levels I'm keeping LA high, Axe up there and putting extra points into CS. <br />
<br />
I guess the only thing I'm worried about in either template is my low weapon skill. Will that cripple me?<br />

<br />
Looks lke you have it set for 2/3s that will work. You may want to experiment as you level with different specs. Try a level or two at 2/3s and then try a couple with 80% and see if you notice the difference.</div></div><hr />
