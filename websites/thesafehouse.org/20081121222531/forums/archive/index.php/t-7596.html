<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ExplodinJones</div><div class="date">06-09-01, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have played EQ on tallon since about a month after its release.  I know melees stink in PvP against casters unless you either get Levels or Resist equipment.<br />
<br />
I am going to make a half-elf Rogue who worships bertox (evil team).  I assume that Tunare Chain armor cannot be worn by me.  So, Im going to go the leather/banded route.  I hope I will be able to do the scout quests in Kelethin to get a magic weapon.  <br />
<br />
I plan leveling first and foremost.  I will most likely make my way to FoB and powerlevel my way to 20 within kurns...As of now, I do not know if I am KoS in FV.  Im a half-elf, but I DO worship bertox.  If not, I will have to do the boat trips back for essential combat trainind...ignoring the other skills which I can do later...<br />
<br />
The big thing is getting a bind at Kaesora.  There should be a level 12 necro there by the time I hit 5 in my newbie hills.  If so I am set...If not, then I had better be careful...I did this route with my DE rogue so I am familiar with the route...sneaking through WW takes a while...<br />
<br />
So...here are some questions.<br />
<br />
Should I be content with banded until I can get some Ravenscale?....I assume I have to be because there is nothin else available.<br />
<br />
As a rogue I get 30 pts.  Should I go all stamina (I hate when you lose that huge chunk of agility when you get low) all dexterity so I can raise rogueish skills and poison later?  or a mix of STR, STA and leave my dex where it is....I only say this because as a half-elf I am both stupid and un-wise.<br />
<br />
If I can grab a necro and a monk for a threesome (woohoo) can we plow our way to 50 in Kunark only.  I really want to get the levels fast with equipment that one or two good groups can obtain.  After I get to a suitable level then Ill worry bout equipment...naturally, I will get MR as high as possible.<br />
<br />
Should I power-level my way in kunark open zones?  Or at some point should I go to Velious, maybe Crystal Cavers for the grinder.<br />
<br />
With evade, Is it possible to level up to 50 and beyond against non-casting critters?  I know it will be boring as hell but I will sacrifice boredom knowing that a post 50 rogue will out melee any PC.<br />
<br />
I DO plan on hardcore-pvp...but at a later date, when I can pretty much demolish the lower levs.  I cannot wait to start assasinating people in E commons...<br />
<br />
Being on Team-Evil, we have the numbers, the zones, and the classes for complete zone control.  One thing we lack is Mobility...<br />
<br />
I see levels as the KEY and deciding factor that will determin vicroty...well, that an Jboots an the ole diagonal strafe...hehe<br />
<br />
what do you all think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tested out a bertoxx gnome in neriak last night and he was very KoS.  I assume Half Elves are the same.  I have been really curious about how this is all going to pan out for evil faction race/class combos that are kos in the evil cities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you'll realize at 50 that you want to be 60.  I think that once you get magic resist, you'll want to get all your other resists.  I think once your in full planar you'll need full Kael gear.  I don't think you want a pvp server, you just want a server where you can spend alot of time to be 'better' then others and perhaps more unique then your current character.<br />
<br />
PvP is no more exciting at lvl 60 then lvl 30.  Of course, if shooting fish in a barrel is 'exciting' for you then by all means powerlvl so you can kill people 20 lvls below you in one hit, spell etc.   Circilly <br />

<br />
I'd be content with banded.  RS is going to be rare unless CT is more camped than it is on a blue server.  I would set ry'gorrs as the goal.<br />
<br />
I would ignore the dex and go str/sta.  <br />
<br />
I would also look for a shaman for your grouping partners (in addition to the monk and necro).  Heals and sows will help at lower levels.  Regen on your necro and slows on the mobs and you are rocking at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Inkie wizards and are your mobility (assuming you mean ports).<br />
<br />
I would probably do kunark until upper 30's, then head to guk for better gear (sash for you and monk, smr for necro, etc).  I would then go for ry'gorr camp after you are done with getting guk stuff for armor, or just go there for a chance of pace.<br />

You aren't going to be able to do the scout cape quest or other quests--because you will be KOS to Kelethin.  If you worship Bertoxxulous, you start out in Qeynos.  Your best bet is to level up in the Warrens.  This is about as good as the FOB and much much better loot.</div></div><hr />
