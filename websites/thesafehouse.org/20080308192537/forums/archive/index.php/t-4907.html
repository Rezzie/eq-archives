what would u think is the best ? <br />
any comment is more than welcomed ...<br />
<br />
Critical Strike 50<br />
Stealth 40<br />
Thrust 39<br />
Dual Wield 34<br />
Envenom 26<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Critical Strike 50<br />
Stealth 40<br />
Thrust 50<br />
Dual Wield 15<br />
Envenom 25<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;     Reasons to have :&lt;/u&gt;<br />
  25 or 26 in Envenom :<br />
Get the upgrade of the disease poison which prevents healsin a more efficient way and which put a low snare that doesn't break with dmgs (would last 2 minutes)<br />
   50 or 39 in Thrust: <br />
Increasing Thrust increases my weapon Skill (making me miss less often on hits), and also my average dmg output .. also the lvl 50 style is made from an Evade but gives a long Duration Stun (for info my lvl 50 CS style works after 4 moves + Evade and gives bleed, just like the 2nd movement from the same chain of Evade)<br />
   15 or 34 in Dual Wield:<br />
Increasing Dual Wield will make me hit with both weapons at same times more often (from around 40% to 60% of the time) which would also increase my dmg output<br />

Dual weild should not be ignored! Perhaps leave dual a bit less, maybe 1/2 level, but I definetly think it's good to keep it up. 		-Miron Quickblade, searching...<br />

<br />
I was leaning towards this:<br />
<br />
40 Stealth<br />
39 Thrusting<br />
38 Envenom<br />
39 Critical Strike<br />
34 Dual Wield<br />
<br />
But I'm scared to do so.  I just know the minute I train these Mythic will come out with a special emergency patch making CS and Envenom ultra uber l33t. Edited by: Dippin Daggers at: 2/21/02 5:11:31 pm</div></div><hr />

and now i have 839 extra points to spend on skills ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shandray</div><div class="date">04-01-02, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't see reason to raise CS to 50?<br />
Well, if you don't care for the CS styles you get by raising CS base skill to 50, you still have to consider that CS skill raises your Perf Art dmg and possibly dmg for other styles.  Not to mention, there aren't many items that give CS bonus, at least not in Midgard.<br />
I don't care much for styles beyond the perf art chain but I still wanna raise my CS to 50 for lower style dmg output.  The only reason I would leave CS at 39 or 40 is if I get the &quot;theoretical&quot; +10 bonus to skill in the long run from realm rank 11.<br />
I say theoretical 'cause the +10 from realm rank 11 still seems unofficial/unproven.</div></div><hr />
