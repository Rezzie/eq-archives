<br />
The Overthere is just about the best experience you can get in the game at 35th to 40th level.  I came at 35th, and three days later left at 40.  This zone is also intended for lower then 35, but since I was not there at those levels, I cant comment on it.<br />
<br />
The Overthere is accessed the most quickly(in my view) by teleporting to the Dreadlands, running to the frontier mountains on the left zone wall, then running to overthere.<br />
<br />
Once there, either B.Y.O.D(Bring your own druid) or shout to find one about your level.  Druids are KEY here.  They are the main part of your tactics.<br />
<br />
Once you find a druid, tell him to come to you at the Frontier Mountains valley.  Once you are both there, turn left and run along the zone line.  About 200 yards along, there should be a corner in the zone line.  Around the corner is the temple entrance to Skyfire.<br />
<br />
Once you get there buff up with SoW, Skin like Stone/Diamond, Strength buff and Chloro.  Once you are buffed up, tell him to med while you pull(I hope he knows to do this anyway).<br />
<br />
You are going to want to pull animals.  The animals in the zone consist of sabretooth tigresses, sabretooth tigers,  and kunark rhinos.  At 35 to 38 you are going to want to pull tigresses and rhinos.  At 38 to 40 pull tigers and tigresses.  Tigers hit a LOT harder, resist and break the druids spells, and have a LOT more hit points.<br />
<br />
Other MOBs in the zone include sarnak beserkers, spiky succulents, and stoneleer co ckatrices.  The beserkers will agro, and so will all the animals.  The rhinos run as fast as SoW, so they will get a hit on you every now and then pulling.<br />
<br />
The advantage of having a druid as opposed to a necro or a shadow knight is they can heal if the MOBs get a few hits in, and they can always keep you SoWed.<br />
<br />
There is an &quot;corner&quot; of the zone near Skyfire mountains which is a great place to fight.  Im not sure of the loc, but it is about halfway between the mountain zone and the skyfire zone.  It is a 90 degree wall.  What you do, is get on the side closest to the mountain zone, and pull to there.  As the mob is incoming, have the druid snare it. Once it gets to you, fear it.  It should walk along the wall, out of the way of other mobs.  It should climb the corner, and walk back down. (Note: This is not an exploit, the mob moves at all times and if it breaks fear will turn on you. I in no way endorse or promote the bug at the Skyfire zone.) <br />
<br />
The reason to fight here is simple. <br />
1)Youre quite near a zone if things go bad <br />
2)The dragoons dont wander near the wall, though you may see them on pulls <br />
3)Mobs dont wander on the wall, so unless you pull multiples you shouldnt get multiples <br />
4)The pathing <br />
<br />
WARNINGThere are Dragoon guards in the zone that con RED to a level 50 and hit in the 130s.  They wander the zone, and sometimes come near your corner.  If you are not evil, I reccomend activating your Mask of Deception the entire time you are there.  Dragoons leave the outpost and patrol the zone (mostly west side) at 11PM game time, and return to outpost by 6AM. So at day, it is safe. Also, dragoons run at sow speed, so while sow will save you, jboots won't.<br />
<br />
Good luck, the exp rolls in like mad there.<br />
