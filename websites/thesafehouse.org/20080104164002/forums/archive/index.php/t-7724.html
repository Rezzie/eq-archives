This, btw, is a well-prepared SK, with lots of resist gear.  Likes to use weaken and things like that as well as engulfing darkness and such.<br />
<br />
Whats the best course of action? clickable items + poison and tactics?</div></div><hr />

Assuming you're in the same ballpark levelwise you're gonna have a VERY hard time significantly outdamaging his lifetaps (50 pt w/ no recycle, 300 pt w/ 6 min recycle and 25 pt proc I think are all the one's he'd have access to at that level), plus the fact that most SK weapons are better for 'jousting' which is a common PVP tactic..</div></div><hr />

Best way to beat a SK as a Rogue would be to stay close to him, try to run through/past him and make your BS hit home.<br />
If he snares you you can as well kiss your ass goodbye.<br />
Forget resists, darkness line is plain level resist in pvp, boil blood cannot be resisted and lifetaps are the same.<br />
Keep him busy, never let him cast something - dont let him do a pet in advance. Its pathing will rip you apart.<br />
If you go below 500 his HT will finish you - back out and vanish then to spare yourself a defeat.<br />
If he is half prepared he will have see invis up - it would be wise to have a pumice stone to dispell him. If he can't see you he is dead.<br />

<br />
Best thing to do is prevent him from casting, the lifetaps are a fairly long cast, and you stand a fair chance of disrupting him.<br />
<br />
Boil Blood is the killer - have pumice stones to scrub that one off.  He/she will be trying to cast Clinging Dark as it has a short recast time and uses little mana, and if it lands it will allow him/her to get far enough away to start banging out lifetaps.<br />
<br />
Another thing, I would have a see invis device on such as a fingerbone hoop - one of my favorite tactics is to use a Circlet of Shadows (pre-nerf) to chain cast and cause my opponent to lose targetting.<br />

<br />
Pray the shadowknight is a gimp and doesnt use shadowstep cause if he does he will get spells off.<br />
<br />
Man forget it, all you can do is hope he is a gimp and uses a noc blade or something and totally forgets to mem see invis or something.<br />
<br />
Just remember you can backstab him without ever seeing his back.  When you run through him you can BS him just as long as you are behind him, you don't need to be facing his back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you got a blind poison, use it,  then  hide and he won't have you targeted for spells anymore.  Even with see invis, going invis or hide will break the target although he can still see you.  Not sure if instill doubt works in PvP, but some form of fear is a good thing, he can't cast if he cant' control himself.<br />
<br />
That's the little info I can say from what I have experienced, and yes, mr/dr/pr works against them, they couldn't get any spells off on me, and the fact that their spell level is 'bout half their level at the most, high resists can and will help.</div></div><hr />

Make him /duel you first, and make sure you're behind him when you accept so you can backstab him right away. Use terrain to your advantage, if he forgets to use a see invis item use hide/sneak to your advantage and he's screwed.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aerimus Shadowborn</div><div class="date">12-27-01, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need...<br />
<br />
First off you need respectable mr so you don't get snared and a see invis item so he can't hide from you to have a chance at all.<br />
<br />
Next I suggest you use a sow potion rather than jboots so you can outrun him since more likely than not he will rely on jboots. <br />
<br />
Next see if he will duel you indoors or in a semi confined space so he can't shadowstep all over hell.  In totally open ground your chance of victory is pretty slim imo.<br />
<br />
b) a golem wand<br />
c) a hotkey that does /doability backstab, then /doability hide<br />
<br />
Golem wands drop in temple of cazic thule and have 5 charges of pillage enchantment.  This spell strips 4 buffs at a time.<br />
<br />
What you do is you strip off his see invis with a few clicks of the wand. Then backstab him and hide repeatedly to get his life down.<br />
<br />
If he has a perma see invis item on or an insta cast one equiped this will be totally useless however since sks get the see invis spell they often don't have a see invis item.<br />
<br />
If he has see invis memed he can recast it but you can pound him while he tries to cast it. Then insta dispell him again once he gets it up.  I recommend snare + slow poison rather than blind when you start meleeing him because while blinded he will likely run around depriving you of any chance of landing a hit.<br />
<br />
If he doesn't have see invis memed he is either gonna be running or trying to disingage entirely which is where the sow potion is gonna help.  If he does get away its time to reapply poison and find him.  If after he gets away he starts casting from out of los you might as well zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Masked TDE</div><div class="date">01-15-02, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go full magic resist.  Engulfed + Feared rogue is a dead rogue.  Use instill constantly through the whole fight and hope you get him feared.  Circle straffe and stay on him the whole time till he or you drops.. That's about the best advice I can think of.    Use poison if you want but go for DD poison if you do.    Mask0r</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Boinshar</div><div class="date">01-15-02, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, hope he's inexperienced, else you have little chance of winning.<br />
<br />
He has a couple of ways of doing damage, some can be countered, others cannot. I'll assume both of you are moving at the same speed.<br />
<br />
1. DoTs<br />
If he's smart, he'll try Darkness once, maybe twice, then stick to Heat Blood, which you can't resist. Dispell it.<br />
<br />
2. Drains<br />
He's got a 45pt drain and a 280pt drain, which is 35 and 220 in pvp respectively. The 220 one is bad, but can only be cast every 3 min, the 35 one is a waste of time mostly. He may try SS/Drain when he gets low, there isn't much you can do unless you picked favorable terrain (ie, flat, small area).<br />
<br />
3. Jousting<br />
If he charges straight at you, there are a number of ways to avoid his attack and BS him. If he does this, you will win. If he's a good jouster, then you've got problems.<br />
<br />
4. Hide and Heal<br />
He will have see invis up (deadeye) so don't even bother with hide/sneak/BS. If he SS out of range, go hide somewere and bandaid up. If he doesn't med, instead walking around looking for you, he'll be at a disadvantage. Make sure you have some type of see invis item, Circlet of Shadows = bad for those who can't see invis.<br />
<br />
All &quot;tricks&quot; about start a duel with BS, terrain choice, potions, items etc aside, pound for pound, SK as a class is far more geared for pvp than rogues. Even if you use every trick in the book, you still may lose. Edited by: Boinshar at: 1/15/02 1:53:36 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aerimus Shadowborn</div><div class="date">01-15-02, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He'll have it up but will he have it memed to recast it...  Even if so dispelling it should get you some free hits.  Say 2 wand clicks are required to fully dispell at the start. Then you can insta click off his see invis 3 more times.  Hopefully he doesn't have his weak pet up heh.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be trying to ID him at all if he has any mr to speak of.  Not only will it be futile but it could cost you backstab oportunities.</div></div><hr />

Hell, I'm a Rogue and I've won more fights than I've lost to Shadow Knights, with your epic, decent AC/HP, a disarm skill.. and of course semi-decent Resistances..  you'll have the upper-hand in my opinion, once you're at 50% I suggest running (not hide/sneaking) out of distance, the Shadow Knight will more than likely try to snare you, hopefully you'll be out of range or resist the spell one -- the reason for running is, a Harm Touch would bring you down really fast.  Once you're certain that you're far enough out of range, or he's lost you one, begin to heal yourself with -Invigorate-.. Try to work fast, the idea is.. healing yourself to full and coming back before he's regained any mana, once he goes out of mana, he's screwed.  I recommend fighting face to face, you'd more than likely get owned in a joust fight, SKs generally have high damage weapons -and- can stun.  If you find a Shadow Knight that's dumb enough to fight you face to face (your typical Shadow Knight will, in hopes of getting more castings off this way).. hold right click down, run around in circles (circle him).. while hitting, disarm and backstab... and let's not forget Instill Doubt -- Kurainight died before Fear wore off one time, was a pretty fast duel.  Anyway, with your epic and a decent offhand, you should be able to drop his life relatively fast, even with his lifetaps.<br />

Monks and Rangers are the real enemies when it comes to dueling, in my opinion.<br />

Duels are much diffrent from the Pvp server. As a rogue of Vallon Zek and a SK on Sullen I can tell you from experiance. You better be prepared or be well skilled in mad evading skillz. Have poison ready if you are stalking a SK to kill and strike when in your favor (blind poison if it sticks). If the SK is well played, better have that skill of hauling a$$ to the zone. You decide the battle not the SK. Shadow Knights are one if not the toughest class to fight as a rogue. In the high end game, they are just plain nasty.<br />

It doesn't work, except for AOE fears which is a bug.  If fear worked, us evil necros would never lose a fight, MR or not.  <br />
<br />
If your MR is good (100 plus) and you're close to him in level, don't worry too much about dark either, it's a two part snare/dot, and it resists like a mofo.  It's rarely worth the casting time.  There's a good chance golem wands might break his see-invis, but at that point he'll SS and run away if he has half a brain.  Try and take him out in a dungeon or something, less pvp preparation on his part, no room to joust/use melee range bug/shadowstep, and the element of surprise will be greater.  Of course if he's in a group you may have other problems after killing.</div></div><hr />

My suggestion: Get a track ball and pray he attempts to joust you, with 1 hand on the dir pad and 1 on the track ball with a good connec, you can strafe circles around him. Oh and a bow + arrows won't hurt either since it will automatically turn you towards him when he SS's. Deris the Reaver<br />

<br />
The original post was 49-50 SK.  This SK will not be boil blooding, and the HT will only be doing 500 not counting pvp nerf.  The only viable lifetap is lifeleech which has long recast time.<br />
<br />
Fear works on regular servers if the gimp has low enough MR.  Which is usually the case with gimps on &quot;blue&quot; servers.  Those skilled at pvp (dueling) will have resist gear and fear will be useless.<br />

<br />
Set your mouse sensitivity way up, make sure you can do at least 2 360s during a jump. Get used to playing with it, then you'd be just fine for circle straife. However, circle straife's more suited for FPS, not against jousters. Edited by: Boinshar at: 3/4/02 1:50:30 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm the guy who stands at the zone dueling random people who think they can &quot;ownage&quot; me, because they have elite twinkness, after about 10 victories in a row, people usually start backing down =P what level is your rogue? does he have his epic? 200+ str? more?  If he does, go face to face with a shadow knight as a test, (hit backstab every time it pops up, all the extra damage helps -- Disarm is nice too, if it works).. and I can almost guarantee you'll still have half life at the end of the fight (considering he doesn't harm touch) -- Rogues can out-melee a Shadow Knight easily, follow those guides and I doubt you'll have any trouble taking one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Skarwolf</div><div class="date">03-04-02, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My comment wasn't directed at you.  Yes it was a blanket statement and I'm sure those who have only dueled once or twice some gimp SK and rate the entire class as such know who they are, and they are whom I was referring to.<br />
<br />
  Any class can excel at dueling it just depends on the skill of the player.  Gear helps but it isn't everything,   skill is.<br />
  <br />
Theres also a huge difference between dueling and ganking, the latter of which is what occurs on PVP servers.  I say ganking because thats usually what happens.  You find someone unawares and make them dead.  If they see you coming they usually run away, gate, or plug.  <br />
<br />
On the &quot;bluebie&quot; servers you have time to prep up, get what you need on, and memorize the spells.  That doesn't happen on a PvP server.  You'll just finish killing something be at low health and then the rogue will BS you, or the SK will HT you.<br />
<br />
As for your advice, refer to the original question.  The person asked about dueling a 49-50 shadowknight.  It will be a close fight at that level, I remember dueling 50 rogue vs 50 tsk (me at the time) pre~kunark it was a close battle.  SK's don't have much spellwise pre 50th, but post 50th they just get stronger.<br />

I always liked duels which set conditions.  I'd agree to them all then kill them using what I wasn't supposed to.<br />
<br />
I once had this enchanter talk shite then refuse to duel after he learned I had 150 MR unbuffed.  He'd only duel unless I removed my MR gear otherwise it wasn't fair.  I agreed to his conditions but kept my gear on anyways and stood there for awhile as he cast away and nothing landed, his debuffs did but I got rid of them.<br />
<br />
Then he charmed some green con mob which I dispelled, then FD and he had to run from the mob and me.  I let the mob finish him just to be nice.<br />
<br />
By the way on &quot;bluebie&quot; servers if you fear someone other people can kill that person.  Try it out its kinda fun.  If you notice two lowbies dueling and they can fear, ask one of them to fear the other then you can start hitting the guy.<br />

I had to run around hoping he wouldn't snare/darkness me =P</div></div><hr />

When he sees you discipline he will float off with bobbing corpse and sow pot until it wears.  Then he'll joust you with a huge 2hs.<br />
<br />
Not a smart thing to say on the safehouse, but I think a smart SK can beat a roag unless something bad happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_anayan</div><div class="date">03-10-02, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zerazia, I admit sks below the 55 mark arent that great duelers, but when a SK hits 55 he gets DS of 12-13 pts of dmg.  When the sks hits level 60 he gets COTA which adds another 5 dmg, and that eats any melee class alive.  When i duel any melee class i barely even attack the whole fight, i have RS3 i run around and lifetap, even if the melee can catch up and hit me, hes loosing lots more hp just by evening attacking.  I have dueled tons of times, dueled 60 rogue last nite, didnt even loose a bub of HP.  Lifetaps keep us up in health greatly, and if we even go  below the halfway point in HP, use leech curse disc and it owns the rogue and its basically a CH for the SK, even if that doesnt work the SK can go to last resort and use HT, which i rarely ever used in duels.  DS+lifetaps gets every melee, only melee that can stand the DS is monk with T staff, which that doesnt even work that well.  Been dueling on most my time on EQ, never lost to a rogue =)  So i think if you beat sks, it would have to be one below 55, or be a total newb<br />

Based on what you say it sounds like you have your opponent stand face to face at the zoneline of a dungeon.  Can you say gimp ?<br />

Quote:  I'm the guy who stands at the zone dueling random people ...  If he does, go face to face with a shadow knight as a test...<br />
<br />
Now that doesn't prove anything.  Obviously a pure melee is going to win over a hybrid in toe to toe which is absolutely pointless.  <br />
<br />
I had a 60th warrior guildmate with epic, full kael get pissed off one day because of that.  &quot;Duels aren't all that running around crap,&quot; she said.  Would only duel if I stood toe to toe rofl.<br />
