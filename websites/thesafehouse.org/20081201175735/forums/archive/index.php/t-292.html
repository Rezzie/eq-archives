<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">09-09-99, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Folks, as you know I been posting on this message board just trying to stay sane.  Now I stayed after work and played the game I love to hate for the first time in over 5 weeks. Here's how it went <br />
  <br />
 I find my self in Great Faydark. I take a deep breath and catch the rotten smell of orc droppings, it seems the entrance to Crushbone is at my feet.  After greetings many old friends and shedding tears over those who have left, I ventured on. <br />
    I enter the ramshackle pile of bricks these orcs call a Castle.  I find myself in the main lobby and have some fun with a Gnome Enchanter.  After checking sure my shovel is nice and dull I head upstairs.  Since I heard no cries of anguish, figures someone has taken up residence upstairs.  Lo and behold the throne room if full of dwarves and a few finger wagglers.  I attempt some small talk but these folks sense my power and dont wish play any reindeer game.  I wait for my old friend just to see how the bastard is doing.  Dvinn shows up and the dogs launch into him.  Never have a liking for  his blue butt, I wait for Lord Orc.  Ole King Crush shows up in the same old place, needles to say I sunk my dagger deep (78 &amp; 58 backstab) and had a new but smelly tunic.  I cried out for the first orc hunter under circle 17 would get the shirt off my very back.  A lovely Erudite showed up and she got me fine shirt and a peck on the cheek.  I took ole Crushes Shirt, which is curiously like the one I was just wearing, and leave this foul place.   <br />
  Upon leaving the castle I see a group of young ruffians hanging about.  I offer a nice sum of 100 gold coins to any brave soul who would challenge me(lvl 28).  A young barbarain and a finge waggler spoke up.  I took on the tall brute first, just to show him the backside of my shovel.  Imagine my surpise when he accepted the duel and dissappred.  A few seconds later I feel a tiny fly bite me in the back! Great Bristlebane! I was taken by a lvl 12 rogue! This was his highlight of the battle for the rest is to brutal to relive.  In the end it seems my dot's caused him to die, so the Gods didnt announce my victory.  This young brave rogue was Kurst, and he did Bristlebane proud.(The finger waggler fell twice and received 200 gold coins).  This young rogue looked haggard but had a nice poker for his age. I made a few quick deals and got him a nice tentacle whip. After asking him questions every rogue knows how to answer <br />
 Do you pray to Bristlebane everday? <br />
 Do you drink alteast three beers a day? <br />
 Do you steal from every beast you can? <br />
 Do you kick gnomes when they are down? <br />
 He was most fun to talk with(a roleplayer) and I traded him his crysknife for a tentacle whip.  After seeing the big smile on his face I departed.   <br />
  <br />
 After laying some coin on a pretty druid, I found my way to Unrest. <br />
 /ooc stories geting long but I had a very fun night <br />
 I met a gm and tried to roleplay with him.  A friend put some copper coins on the floor, and I told the gm it was a evil trap.  If the gm would just pick up the coins, he would see the trap. Needless to say the gm just stood there, and said&quot;I got petitions to answer and left&quot; <br />
 . How lame, I said &quot; What a lame gm, All they care about are petitions&quot; <br />
 Also ran into Meglan and had a good chat! <br />
