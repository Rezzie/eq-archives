<br />
Is there a limited number of time you can do that ?<br />
<br />
I know for a sword you will eventually run out of durabilty but for a jewel ?<br />
<br />
Yesterday I got my hand on a jewel of madness from Muire Tomb (nice +1 stealth) and I wanted to know if I could use it all the time or if I would be better to leave In the bank and just get it out when I got PvP. Baron Thanak Kalahed <br />

There are some items that don't have durability shown when you right click on it but those are being corrected as the dev team finds them.</div></div><hr />

Then the smith will give some message along the lines of &quot;I cannot repair that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Each time you repair, the durability drops (well I've seen exceptions).  Based on my experience, the quality of the items is a factor in how large a durability hit the item recieves when repaired.  Dropped items (80-89% qual) can take as much as 7-10% hit per repair, while quested items (usually 100%), may only take 2-3%, or none at all.<br />
<br />
Once durability reaches 0%, the item can no longer be repaired.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see why a jewel would wear out otherwise.  I have out grown jewels though.<br />
