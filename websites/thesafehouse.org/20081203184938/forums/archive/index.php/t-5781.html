*Today's Patch*<br />
<br />
Today's patch consisted mostly of server-side changes, additions, and fixes regarding NPCs and quests. The only item of public note is that the Ragebringer can no longer be equipped in the ranged slot.  A data entry error caused it to be initially allowed it to be equipped in that slot.<br />

<br />
You just can't re-equip them into that slot then.<br />
<br />
So, as long as you don't change this, or you don't die, you can still keep the RB in range slot. &lt;u&gt;ShadowCross Bladesong&lt;/u&gt;<br />

<br />
1) they actually did it in the LAST patch, and<br />
2) Kendrick said the change was an error and would be moved back to ranged.<br />
<br />
This is the same exact thing as with the Gunthak Harpoon.<br />
First, Verant: NORENT.<br />
Later, Kendrick makes it rentable<br />
Then even Later, someone else comes by and says &quot;Whoops! Database mistake!&quot;<br />
<br />
So now you wonder who is driving this ship; looks like Captain Abashi this time around.<br />
<br />
And yes there were many reasons for me to put it in Ranged.  I used to have my RB in every slot at various times during an evening's battles.</div></div><hr />

Kenderick posted regarding a thread regarding that issue on this board and stated that the change had been a mistake and he would be changed back.  So .. what's up with this? They decide not to change it back after all?<br />
