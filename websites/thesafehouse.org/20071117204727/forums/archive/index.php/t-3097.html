<br />
I may have to pick up some of these books just for the story factor. I've always pretty much hated the system, but they were usually well written and interesting reads.</div></div><hr />

They said when they started the world of darkness they were going to end it someday. That's happening.</div></div><hr />

I wish there was a compilation of the timeline, &amp;amp; plot taken from the assorted rulebooks.  I would love to read over all that stuff, without having to waste time with the rules.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Reinerfore</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love th WoD stories and rules.  In my eye, it's a system that encourages you to step away from what's written and just make the story.  But It's kind of sad that the characters will end.  The personalities out there were awesome (Bookworm55, Witness1, John Coaler, Harvey Cuillio/Hasmed) and well fleshed out. The end days should be interesting to read about as well.  What has been speculation for years is finally coming to light. It's nice to see they're actually putting Lassie down instead of running the Armageddon thing till it's 2095.<br />
<br />
Did the press release also say they're stopping print on all their WoD material next year as well?  That would ruin my day.</div></div><hr />

You don't see that anymore, the companies that are left are way to corporate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually yes, I think it did. I do remember reading somewhere on there that they would no longer be printing already-released books, but there's already such a massive amount of copies out there that it's really no problem. trying to sell old WoD books is a complete pain in the ass</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, they said that while they are no longer going to release new books in the modern WoD setting, they are going to start a whole new series, with a completely new slant on the occult in the modern era, but its NOT gonna be post-apocalyptic.  So in reality, they are going to be coming out with all new rulesets, which you'll have to buy all over again.<br />
<br />
Also, they said they were going to continue their new Dark Ages line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Reinerfore</div><div class="date">08-09-03, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually two of the books I wanted are hard to get now that they are out of print.  Finding Warith the Oblivion material is tough and the price of Hunter: Wayward went way up.  Wayward was a good book, but not as good as the price dictates.  8 creed books with a lost brother for me</div></div><hr />
