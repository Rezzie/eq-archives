If you want a complete list of magic items in the game, just open up the editor and look at them...<br />

I'll load a saved game I have in that chapter and give you the specifics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dake</div><div class="date">07-05-02, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you referring to the smith in act 1?  He can give you a book with all the recipes.<br />
<br />
The Namarra Rapier is 1d6 with a 75% of daze for 2 rounds.  Very handy.  Later, you might run into a Kaga-to Katana.  1d10 w/ 50% chance of daze.<br />
<br />
The Saint's Katana is 1d10 with 1d6 sonic damage vs. evil.  I tend to offhand this one, daze is generally more useful.<br />
<br />
Any enhancement bonus on the item you use to make it is carried over, I think.<br />
<br />
The Whitebone Leather Armor is actually heavy.  Don't waste your magic leathers on it.<br />
<br />
Also, if you need an excellent source of weapons to enchant, go to the store in the Docks district.  It's a higher-class shop than anything in the Core.<br />
<br />
The second act is annoying as hell.  I've got more reagents than I can possibly use, but the recipes are very magic-oriented and I'm not even sure if I could get a nice weapon out of it.  Is there any place to get magic items besides that mage's place?  I'm hoping once I get to Luskan there will be.</div></div><hr />

Don't waste your magic leathers on it.Spend the 500 gold and the regents to make it and sell it to a merchant.  You make more cash that way.<br />
<br />
But if cash isn't an issue sell it and save the gargoyle skull.  I have read people ending the game with millions in gold, but I seem to be strapped for cash every which way I turn.<br />
<br />
Also, I have found the werewolf hunter guy in Chapter Two to have a VERY nice buying percentage.  Sell to him, I guess if you want to make cash.<br />
<br />
He seems sort of too jovial to me... in a creepy way.  Creepily jovial.  Gives me the CREEEEEPS!  Just strolling into town one day with all this werewolf gear?  Makes you wonder if he'll be around much longer...<br />

And there you have it.  A list of recipes for magic armor/weapons.  All courtesy of the Official Adventure Guide from Verses Books.<br />
<br />
  Speculation<br />
I have seen +2 and +3 versions of these items, so I am thinking there is more than one armorer available to craft these things.  I doubt very seriously you can find a +3 set of armor in the Core.  The armorer will probably be located in another city so hold on to those regents!<br />
<br />
I only came across ONE gargoyle skull in Chapter One.  In Port Llast there is no smith to make magic armor/weapons (that I have come across).  However, I have found a bazillion gargoyle skulls.  This makes me think there is another person to make armor down the road.<br />
<br />
There  is a person to make magic items other than these in Port Llast though, and that is a whole other Llist (haha Llast Llist). Edited by: Acinonyx SW at: 7/5/02 4:43:01 pm</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-06-02, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Keep that stuff like Pixie Dust, Gargoyle Skulls, etc etc.. you might not get it again later, although you can make weapons later in the game...<br />
<br />
2. There isn't a smith for magical weapons in Chapter 2 of the game, but in Chapter 1 and 3.<br />
<br />
3. The enhancement bonus of the weapon used to create the new magical weapon is NOT relevant. Use the lowest one possible, which should usually be +1.<br />
<br />
4. The weapons in Chapter 3 are basically exactly the same ones as in level 1, but with a +2 bonus instead of a +1 .. and they cost a LOT more.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My favorite combo is Namarra Rapier &amp;amp; Feyduster Short Sword - one weapon proc's Sleep, the other Daze... so usually I can expect my enemy to be helpless quite fast.. .which means that I can use my rogue sneak attack bonus on all attacks.   ShadowCross Bladesong<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-06-02, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same with that combo SX, I love those two together.  I hope I can get some more fairydust in chapter 3 though to make the +2, I'm in Luskan already and fresh out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-06-02, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After getting about 20 Fairy Dusts in Chapter 2, I noticed when I finally got into Chapter 3 that I had sold all of them..  <br />
<br />
And I certainly won't do all the stuff between again.... and so far I haven't been able to find any Fairy Dust in Chapter 3. Sorry...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Thalish Bladespinner</div><div class="date">07-06-02, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Suck.  I have fairy dust, magic shortsword; dragon's blood, magic rapier etc...<br />
<br />
Smith would only make the damn club for me.  Any ideas how to get him to do the others?  Is there a specific inventory spot you have to put the ingredients into?</div></div><hr />

In chpt 1 you get most of the reagents for the smithed items from the boss mobs.  Such as for each part of the cure reagent you recover there should be a special smithing reagent with it.  To get the diamond though i had to do the quest involving stealing the paintings for the chick in moonstone and persuade her to give me more loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-06-02, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thalish, usually it doesn't matter where those items are in... but what I know for sure is that you need regular magic weapons.. ones that just have a bonus without any other specials...<br />
<br />
A rapier +1 will work, a rapier +1 with +1D6 Fire damage wouldn't...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finished the game and there wasn't ANY fairy dust in the 3rd chapter.<br />
<br />
So I just used a +3 short sword instead.</div></div><hr />
