<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ciardha Sidhe</div><div class="date">05-14-02, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I'm looking at the realm abilities with their new &amp;amp; improved descriptions, trying to figure out what to spend my points on that either makes me (a) more damage output and/or (b) longer life.<br />
<br />
Naturally, I'm looking at Viper since I'm partial to poisons in the first place, and double damage is pretty nice.  Then I notice that for the same price (not consider prereq), I can get Bladedance, which is on the same 30 minute timer.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I can't seem to find any reports of the damage Bladedance does to someone standing right next to you.  (After this last patch, before that it wasn't too impressive.)  Anyone have any idea?<br />
<br />
If it's sufficiently high, then it might be a better damage alternative than Viper since it can't be purged and delivers all of its extra damage up front.  The fact that it hits more than one person is just frosting. Ciardha Sidhe, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ciardha Sidhe</div><div class="date">05-15-02, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even 300 damage to someone right next to you would be worthwhile as a nice companion to PA/CD/SS.  Viper can add another 400ish damage to Lifebane, but it takes a while to do it.  Being able to start with an additional damage boost, especially using Enervating on the main weapon, might be better.<br />
<br />
Still no numbers from anyone I've talked to.  Interesting.</div></div><hr />

(Rank 2, Level 5... I don't get out much.)<br />
<br />
Guess I'll keep lurking at the Guardian boards...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ciardha Sidhe</div><div class="date">05-20-02, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone got around to testing it.  Full report on Bladedance and Hail of Blows is here:  vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=29867214<br />
<br />
Unfortunately...<br />

Quote: How much damage does bladedance do? Well as you may/may not know it's a PBae (Point Blank area effect) spell in the middle of the radius you can expect your Bladedance to hit for 100-150 damage 150 being highly unlikely reaching out to the outer edges I'd say not even 15 feet away it dramatically decreses to the 25-40 damage range.Not worth the 14 points by a long shot.</div></div><hr />

I'll give it a try with one of my RS respecs on Pen, if I can afford it...  (Unfortunately, missed the latter half of realm skill testing due to loss of internet access until now)</div></div><hr />
