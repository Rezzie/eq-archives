<br />
That is probably one of, if not the best opening movies to a game i've ever seen. I'm trying to think of a game that comes close.. but I'm drawing a blank. ~</div></div><hr />

Takes a lot to make a jaded bastard like me just want to up and save a world I know is imaginary. =)</div></div><hr />

Makes me glad they didnt throw in lots with the rest of the online games and what I was worried about when I got it.<br />
<br />
That they kept true to their FF Roots and have a good story is what is probably going to keep me intrested longer than Ive been intrested in other games.<br />
Well, and that you can try a different class without having to start over or limit your other options.</div></div><hr />

When was the last time you saw any Square game with a half-ass story???</div></div><hr />
