<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remmi</div><div class="date">05-02-02, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, lads and lasses, it looks like NWN is just 'round the proverbial dark corner! And ol' Grandpappy Remmi has plans fer a semi-persistent &quot;safehouse&quot; server fer all my roguish kin to hang 'round in --course it depends on the actual system specs and such but I'm plannin on giving it a shot.<br />
<br />
So, anybody interested? My thoughts are simple: I'll create a Safehouse building, with the rooms laid out somewhat similarly to what we have here on the forums. Again, I don't know exactly what the limitations are but we'll work with it. It appears that 64 simultaneous connections will be the max, regardless of bandwidth/hardware/etc. so it's not like we'll be able to pack em in!<br />
<br />
This will give us the chance to create our favorite D&amp;amp;D rogue characters and chat/adventure in the Safehouse in &quot;real time&quot;. Not to mention the opportunity for me to give ye idjits a REAL thwap with me Idjit Thwapping Stick (tm)!! HAR! *Remmi scowls*<br />
<br />
Well, that's my thought. Whether or not it's practical remains to be seen... Remmi (ornery dwarven rogue and thwapper of idjits!)<br />

As a programmer I'd be more than willing to assist in making the virtual Safehouse a little bit more &quot;interesting&quot; - especially for visitors.<br />
<br />
I could also assist with a bit of CPU/load power, as I can keep up my PC mostly 24/7 - so I could also handly part of the Safehouse - if they managed to keep in all the features they said they'd do, it should be possible to divide the Safehouse into two or more parts and host them on several computers/servers.<br />

<br />
Shadowcross, I think that's what we'll need to do to really make it impressive--create &quot;portals&quot; between machines, distribute the workload and offer up more areas at the same time.<br />
<br />
I have a dedicated machine for it right now as well and I'm gonna try to beef it up. It's only a Celeron 400 but it's got 512 MB ram. If I get a new mobo/CPU for my main PC I can bump it up to a 1 ghz T-bird. Remmi (ornery dwarven rogue and thwapper of idjits!)<br />

<br />
This is something I typed up 2 years ago when NWN2 was in the early stages as a possible cool way to play the game in real RP.  I still think something like this would be pretty cool, if the game design worked for it.<br />
<br />
I originally wrote it for my guild, which is a good-alligned guild and has people who know each other OOC relatively well, to explain why I make a point of mentioning the good-evil thing  <br />
<br />
Quote: <br />
<br />
Now I don't for the life of me know how flexible the game design will be, but if I had my drothers, this is how I think I'd like it to look.<br />
<br />
1) Have one primary city in which much of the main STORY takes place.  The city would be populated with merchants, <br />
beggars, nobles, etc., perhaps along the lines of Sanctuary from Thieves' World (or really any fantasy city, heh).  The city would have to be large enough that players wouldn't always be bumping into each other every five minutes (see 2 <br />
below for the reason why).  However, the outside areas would also be available for all-around monster killing and dungeon romping.<br />
<br />
2) There would be 3 primary factions vying for control of the city.  2 'legit' noble houses, say, and an underworld.  I would propose that those who want to be &quot;Evil&quot; (or perhaps Chaotic) would play their characters as part of the underworld a la the Mockers in Feist's Riftwar.  There would be heirarchy within it, and as characters grew, they would be 'promoted.'  This would provide an outlet for those who are <br />
interested in pickpocketing or mugging or the like.  If they choose to mug/steal from a player, then there is the possibility for PvP.      <br />
<br />
The 2 legit houses would be along the lines of the Capulet/Montague relationship from Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet.  The two houses would hate each other, and would brawl if given <br />
the chance (hence you need  a large city to aviod constant braws at the one tavern, heh).  The members of these houses would be fanatically loyal to their leaders, such that any character type could be played as a 'legit' character.  <br />
You want to be a thief or assassin?  You're not 'evil' (or chaotic) if you think you're doing the right thing by killing someone from te opposing hosue.  I would propose that players wishing to play as a legit character be assigned <br />
randomly to one or the other house.  This will a) keep cliques from forming in-game by people who already know each other well and b) encourage roleplay, since players would be encouraged to take actions against their RL friends.  As <br />
players become more involved (and RP better), then they can be awarded higher rank (beyond just level) within their organization.  At some point I think it would be great if all the major heirarchy characters are player-controlled, such that the 2 Dukes, or whatever, plot against one another, design raids or political machinations, and direct other PCs to actually do the dirty work.  Or even if a Duchess tries to assume the power of her house by conspiring with the other Duke to have her husband killed.  Extending this, perhaps there could be 'secret' factions (again assigned, to aviod hard feelings and name calling) within the 3 uber-organizations.  I don't know if you ever played Paranoia (great game), but all characters had a secret society to which they belonged, <br />
and which really drove their actions.  Perhaps all the characters could be assigned a secondary 'true' loyalty as another motivator.<br />
<br />
I guess what it all comes down to is that I really believe that you want convincing role play beyond a bunch of people saying thee and thou while hacking and slashing for experience, the key figures in the game will have to eventually be run by actual people so that they can direct the action in a rational way.  While some may find this restrictive, I believe that what most people are interested in in MMOGs is more than just getting to kill things in a group, but an actual story. <br />
<br />
So to recap, here's what I envision: a) a central city in which the Story takes place, and the active involvement of players within the story b) outside 'dungeon' areas in which people can dungeon romp if that's their desire and c) randomly (or <br />
non-randomly) assigned factions that hate each other enough to PvP, as well as 'true' factions that are unknown to others and which REALLY guide players' actions.</div></div><hr />

Btw anyone found a way to create pathes between tiles? I'm trying to make a garden but the only sectiles I found ( a '+' shaped and a '-' shaped tiles) don't connect (ie they're automatically placed in the middle of the tile,  <br />
but there's a large border with no path: + - )<br />
. . .there ------------------------------------^ <br />
<br />
hope it makes sense.<br />
<br />
(haha bet all the safehouse merchants will have the 'buys stolen goods' option checked).<br />
<br />
Haven't been foolin with scripts yet, but that's quite a list of reactions they have.<br />
<br />
Also is the &quot;poison&quot; spell the only way to make poisons, or has anyone found how to create a poisoned dagger/how to make a weapon poisonous?<br />

<br />
Edit-  Friggin' Geocities.  *sigh*.  Here's all the pics on a page I whipped up.  www.geocities.com/mephyt/nwn.html<br />
<br />
Now, a couple of things.  There's a lot of really cool visual details that you folks are gonna love.  Dake's hood, Kethaal's hair, vest, and sleeve all flow and bounce as you move them.  Very slick.  There's no robes or cloaks in yet, but word is that the full toolset/game will have them.  The icy katana in Kethaal's right hand drips little ice sparkles, which looks awesome.  The electricity on the tips of Daklin's staff is animated and cool looking.  I went a little overboard on particle effects just to show them off  .  The tattoo on Dake the monk's arm can be recolored, as can any of the armor, skin, and hair.<br />
<br />
It's a very robust creation utility.  I can't wait for the full version. Edited by: Dake  at: 5/30/02 3:43:54 pm</div></div><hr />

As a bonus for preordering, I got a Forgotten Realms desktop module and a will also receive a FR novel when I pick up the game.  So basically, I get around $50 worth of extra stuff just for preordering.  <br />

/ooc - I'll be looking at running a NWN campaign with some friends of mine from EQ/DAoC, and I have warned them that this won't be something that is 24/7 since we are dealing with many people on many different time zones, plus there is NO way I would be able to keep up trying to DM AND create dungeons, cities, NPCs, etc.<br />
<br />
With that being the case, for those who are looking at GMing, I think it would be nice for all of us to share various things we have built to make things a bit easier on each of us.  True, things are meant to be modular so that you can go from one world to another, but for those of us wanting to keep an ongoing campaign with the same players and characters, that doesn't sound like the best situation for us.  But we'll see, I'm still trying to understand all of the parameters for the game.<br />

Okay, finally got NWN/Toolset running without locking up every 20 minutes. So, NWN-Safehouse is now under construction! It'll be a work-in-progress because a) I don't have loads of free time on my hands to work on it b) I want it done right c) I'm still learning d) I'm slow!! So expect it when you see it. <br />
<br />
My plan is to make portions of it &quot;live&quot; even during construction so don't fret! You WON'T have to wait until it's 100% complete...</div></div><hr />

Aye, eventually it will be hosted by Aidden and his kick-arse Linux boxes but fer now I'll test it on my wee Celeron 400 machine.... *Remmi scowls*</div></div><hr />

Now I am. I'm not as active on the 'House as many of y'all but if it's permissible I'd love to help with the project (if any programming help is needed).<br />

Oh, and the Linux server is out now   Hopefully the Linux client won't be far behind...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">07-01-02, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I look forward to virtual safehouse quite a bit.  Have you all looked into the server portal coding that can be done?  <br />
<br />
I was thinking that once the virtual safehouse was complete, that you guys could link to some of the more popular modules that are also dedicated or that maybe I could have a portal to it from my little module, just not sure how that would work with server-only characters on two different servers.<br />
<br />
If you need any help with scripting some things, I have been able to get the following working:  cause player respawn at a specific point, merchants, mob respawn at differing times (not using encounters), killing mob &quot;a&quot; spawns mob &quot;b&quot;, opening door spawns mob &quot;a&quot; at point a and mob &quot;b&quot; at point b, npc &quot;a&quot; gets killed and player characters say their cuss (voicechat XC), npc &quot;a&quot; dies and yells a death scream, mob &quot;a&quot; notices a PC and beckons to fight with voice, first conversation with npc is different from the second conversation with an npc (i.e. the npc knows how often the player character has initiated dialog with it), and a bit more<br />
<br />
sorry for all the mob &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; stuff, but I hope you get the idea.  Send me an email if you would like some info.  I did not write all of the code for these things, though I have modified a bunch of what I found available on the net.  This offer goes out to anyone working on modules.</div></div><hr />

I just **** around and look for things.  But the 2 of them are doing an awesome job.  Havne't gotten Remmi's contribution yet but it should be excellent.</div></div><hr />
