So I eventually give up and go outside and solo, make about a quarter bubble and get killed, you get the picture.<br />
<br />
Is there anyplace else I can group?<br />
<br />
More importantly, can anyone recommend a good place to solo at 31? Someplace where I can pull things and not make steady backwards progress due to death by surprise adds would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cougar Pak</div><div class="date">05-21-02, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't suggest where to solo.. but I spent most of my upper 20s and mid 30s in the frontier with a druid and hero friend. We trio'ed in out of the way places in both the Gorge and Collory. Stay away from the ant valley and the 2 rat camps and you'll more than likely live through vader attacks.<br />
<br />
Try hillock changelings and mega's and juvies. Try the deamons that roam above the first rats. When you get really brave in your group you can go do the white boars... I'd stay away from the various invader camps around - for some reason they are alot tougher for their con than others my trio found out.<br />
<br />
Solo though, I really can't advise you... as I never had the patience to solo post 20 on my shade. Squabblers too high/low? what about right outside DL in Connacht? Any place around Innis to solo at your level? Perhaps the cliffs? At any rate, some things to at least get ya thinking.</div></div><hr />

Thanks! I found the Mist Wraiths and they were mostly blue with some yellows, just right. I am lvl 32 now.<br />
<br />
What gorge is this? How do I get there?</div></div><hr />

It was before the zone was itemized, so it was nothing but cash drops (which is good for 15 hours of soloing).<br />
