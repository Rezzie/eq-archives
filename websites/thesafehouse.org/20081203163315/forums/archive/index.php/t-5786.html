<br />
As before the TTL for the DNS has some overlap, so for another 12 hours or so you might still get shot to the old location..<br />
<br />
For those of you who had design issues with the last site, I think you will find most of them gone.<br />
For those of you who had conection issues, slow page loads, 404 errors (this includes all of us), I can guarentee you that those issues are now gone.<br />
<br />
Enjoy..<br />
Critique..<br />
If you find something wrong, blame Zato... If he is not around pick Vaslin next and direct your anger towards him. If all else fails, bitch to Fiae, he wont care, but at least you can get a good thwrap from a 2x4..<br />
Whatever you do, dont tell Kezzek your woes.. Hes sleeping at the moment..</div></div><hr />

That is the old server.. That thing started to deteriorate the second we put it up. The Database engine just seems to not to want ot stay alive..<br />
<br />
If anyone is chomping at the bit to see the new site and still cant, try this Link. This will get you to the same place, until your ISP's DNS servers update with the new information.</div></div><hr />
