<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Smith of Innoruuk</div><div class="date">04-19-02, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly I’m not trying to spec for PvE at all. If I enjoy playing the Infiltrator at the high level I’ll keep playing him and expect to get more +’s from rps. Also I expect that with spellcrafting coming in eventually, I won’t have any problems getting 10+ from items. I’m also not trying to be a rogue killer. Efectiveness against other rogues isn’t a concern other than maybe to reveal them, but if I’m viable against them I’ll be happy.<br />
<br />
CS 50<br />
Thrust 44<br />
Stealth 35<br />
Envenom 34<br />
DW 21<br />
<br />
I’m bringing CS up to 50 because it keeps adding to damage and later on I could expect to be 60+ easily with items and RPs.<br />
<br />
Thrust to 44 for decent melee skills after the CS has gone off or failed, also to make my second weapon a little more useful. Not bringing it up higher because frankly I don’t expect to get a lot of evades in rvr, and I need the points elsewhere. I’ve also got the 50 slash skill on another character and while useful, probably wasn’t worth the points for the style alone.<br />
<br />
Stealth is the only one that worries me a little, I have no doubt I can get the +11 from items bringing it to 46, and it will take a fair number of rp’s to bring it to 50, but I may end up not being very effective until level 50. I’d love to hear input from others that are sub 50 stealth and what percentage of the time they were being found.<br />
<br />
Envenom is kind of a wild card to me, again with rp’s and items I can bring it to 50, but really don’t think it will be that big of a deal for me to not use lifebane until later. If I had to bring up stealth, I’d sacrifice envenom to do it.<br />
<br />
DW mostly just to increase the frequency of the second weapon going off, and taking it to 21 is pretty efficient on point usage.<br />
<br />
Over all this template lets me have 1 spare point at the end. <br />
<br />
Thoughts? <br />

[Edit] Have to autotrain stealth to 6 to make it work btw, which is already done.<br />
