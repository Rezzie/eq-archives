<br />
other than that, they didnt cut out anything as far as i could see.. maybe a few drops of blood here and there but *shrugs* it was ok.</div></div><hr />

It spoiled what is supposed to be a big twist.  I'm sure the commercial for next week will show him opening the Gates too.</div></div><hr />

You are correct :( they almost showed the whole battle =(.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well no. The whole esp is great...im just saying that by them showing the gates and his moves it kinda ruins the &quot;wow&quot; effect somewhat :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">08-31-06, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know most of you don't watch the Naruto fillers, but seeing as we are talking about Lee &amp; gates... there was a filler not too long ago in which Lee &amp; Gai were featured quite well. Not telling too much here, don't want to spoil it.<br />
<br />
Besides, the last arc (the one currently running) is very good in my eyes. Started 197 I think with the Lee/Gai story being more or less directly before that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">08-31-06, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That little Lee/Gai arc was surprisingly good.  This last arc was okay until this last episode.  WAY to much stupid **** in it.<br />
<br />
Okay, so they stop the kids throwing knives at the suspicious target, okay.  Then while Naruto goes to get someone to check it out, what does Lee and Choiji do?  Lets the kids go back to throwing ******* knives at it!<br />
<br />
Tenten dropping her morning star in the ******* hall.  How do you accidentally drop something you have to ******* SUMMON first!  How did she accidentally ******* summon a morning star THEN dropped it?!<br />
<br />
Okay, so Neji and Hinata see chakra lines going through the whole village with Byakugan.  One problem with that, last episode they JUST got done searching the whole city with Byakugan, and they didn't see **** then!<br />
<br />
And then there's Shikamaru.  He's a genius.  But the writers are morons.  They can't think up something clever for him to figure out.  So instead, they make him figure out obvious **** and make everyone else in the village too ******* stupid to figure out said obvious **** without him.  &quot;These thousand copies of his letter of recomendation he dropped from the sky...they're a distraction!&quot;  Really?  No **** Sherloc.  You mean he's not just reapplying for his job a thousand times by airmail?  Brilliant!  It must be reassuring to know the Hokage was too stupid to figure that one out on her own.<br />
<br />
The whole place deserves to ******* blow up.  And take it's shitty plotholes with it!</div></div><hr />

The part with the throwing knives was totally stupid, agreed. <br />
<br />
Tenten: I think she could have either wanted to summon a morning star (for what ever reason) and dropped it accidently or she accidently triggered a summoning (maybe ripped something?) - that one didn't bother me much<br />
<br />
The thing about the chakra lines didn't bother me at all - as a matter of fact, Neji even explained it in the episode! When &quot;scanning&quot; large areas, they only notice obvious stuff. They wouldn't notice a thin chakra thread unless they KNOW it's there. But once they found the first thread, they knew exactly what to look for and could follow them more quickly. I think it was a problem of the animation - think of the chakra thread being as thin as the wires they usually use - you cannot see them unless you know they are there.</div></div><hr />

Well, have no fear, I'm one of the only seven people in the country actually watching Naruto for the first time like this, and like I said, I didn't see the commercials.  The punchline for the weights was heavily telegraphed anyway.  I have to admit though, that episode was pretty damn awesome...<br />
<br />
Except Garaa hasn't actually done anything, he just stands there and emotes while his pet sand elemental does all the work.  How did this guy get through ninja school?  What does he do when it rains?  Any one of those water ninjas from the last arc could take him over their knee and paddle his behind raw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">09-01-06, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine he got through ninja school based on the fact that he's invincible.  They even said Lee's the first person to ever get through the sand.  Invulerability probably makes up for an awful lot of lack of martial arts skill.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you would assume water would do anything to the sand, unless you are assuming that since it worked on Crocodile in OP that it would work on Gaara.<br />
<br />
An assumtion I wouldn't make.  I imagine if you use water on Gaara you just end up having your organs crushed by wet sand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">09-01-06, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yar, he can make the sand pretty solid, water wouldn't effect it. Hell, wet sand, if Gaara let it get wet, would just be more painful to get hit by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">09-01-06, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like it has to stay relatively solid, if it could spread out into a mist Lee would already be dead, his lungs cut to ribbons.  It would be mobile, malevolent asbestos.<br />
<br />
And given that Lee can dodge and outrun it, the sand also obeys the laws of momentum.  That means being wet is going to make it heavier and slower, and moving water can push it (so could moving air, come to think of it).  A good rain storm would go a long way towards evening the odds for someone like Sasuke, and that water dragon from the bridge builder arc could well be an even match for it.</div></div><hr />

I want to feel bad for you but frankly the timing of that is just awsome.</div></div><hr />

She was running back and forth wanting to play, skidded out, went very rigid and whimpered a bit, and then it was over.  Whole thing took less than a minute.  Not the least bit zen, no universal irony, my poor girl just fell over dead.</div></div><hr />
