I can generally tell who is about to try to pk me, i always keep outside view on when running through antonica or velious to see if anyone is behind me.  I generally stop, turn around, and /glare at someone if they're tailing me.  If they start casting root/snare/darkness i've got a better chance.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gsam</div><div class="date">05-01-01, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ice Comet is not to be feared with a decent resists package and self awareness. Ice comet is only used in pvp as a first strike spell due to its huge damage it often scares victims into running if it doesnt kill them outright (IE gank) After ice comet you can expect to recieve a flurry of draughts or lures. As for gear the above its mostly correct but I wanted to add a few things.<br />
<br />
MR = most important resist, Wizards also have root and shackle (Snare) so if you completly ignore your MR going for cold resists your screwed cause you wont be able to get away.<br />
<br />
Once you hit level 47 you need to worry about fire resists also. level 51 wizards get draugh of fire which is a 3 second cast time and hits for right about 400 dmg. That is the bread and butter PK spell cause you can often get it off due to its fast cast time.<br />
<br />
Suggested gear is easy:<br />
find a jeweler. If you cant afford diamond/jacinth/blue diamond gear then opt for the cheaper single resists items. Some good examples of a cheap PvP setup are +9 mr neck, +10 cold resists rings, +7 MR bracers, Dwarven tunic, Mithril arms, mithril legs, tizmak gloves, +5 fire resists earrings from lavastorm, guise of deciever, Frog king crown,<br />
<br />
now you may think the frog king crown is too nice an item to risk in pvp but 9 times out of 10 the PK will already have one so they wont loot it due to lore tag. The rest of the items will cost you around 100ish plat a piece from a jeweler. Cept for the mithril armor.<br />
<br />
I cant stress how important MR is moreso then fire and cold, Chanters and wizards will often PK together, you want to shoot for having 100+ MR after being tashed. That is possible, Once your over 100 MR you can resist most any snares/roots/darkness/mes spells. As long as your mobile you can live, thats why MR is so important, the minute your rooted or snared your dead. As long as you can resist snares and stuff you can escape.<br />
<br />
Few other tips I can offer you is to change spell casting messages by players to RED in your text box, the default blue is sometimes hard to read. When you see bright red messages popping up saying XXXX begins to cast a spell you may recognize the name of a PK or enemy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sir Ownjooall</div><div class="date">05-03-01, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The previous posters are quite right. Ice Comet is essentially a first strike spell. The best defense against it is awareness. With experience fighting wizards you will actually learn to appreciate the ones obsessed with getting their biggest nuke off. They are the easiest targets.<br />
<br />
The most difficult wizard to fight is one with a good understanding of Yonder as a tool and that keeps lower level fast nukes memorized. With time you will learn to fear the fast low 50s draughts much more then the comet.<br />
<br />
Whenever you are in range of 51+ spells in pvp I would suggest trying to raise your FR/CR each above 100. This is of course secondary to a MR well above 100, as you cannot even finish a well played caster if you have a poor MR.<br />

So far my experiences with ice comet have been decent.<br />
Since i wear a guardian robe - wizards expect to kill me in one pop.. and arent even ready to dish out a second.  By the time they realize i'm not dead.. i'm gone. Edited by: Cylant at: 5/29/01 6:21:04 pm</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cylant</div><div class="date">05-29-01, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had another run in with ice-comet last night.. took elegance's advice.  I see a guy named &quot;Misalgined Doomcaster&quot; in my range - erudite wizard - hanging around the karnor's castle zone.  He is without guild.  I see him walk up to me - target me - and start casting an ice-based spell.  I stood up - and started laying into him.  He didn't get a spell off - and tried to make me zone after him by hovering around the zone.  I didn't fall for it - because if i did he would have loaded faster than i and it would have been the end of me.  He came back and decided to use draught of fire this time since he never got anything else off on me.  Got one off - 450 damage.  Channeled one through - 81 damage.  He zoned with around 50hp left and a shaman with epic killed him.  It turns out the guy had been ganking people around karnor's castle all day.<br />
<br />
So just as a word of advice - if self-proclaimed &quot;Doomcasters&quot; begin casting ice comet in front of you - shoot first and ask questions later.  Thanks for the tip elegance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Learn who your enemies are and check you /who all more often than you do. When you see an enemy in the zone go kill them. Keep a list of all the ppl who have ever attacked you and kos them no matter what. Most of the time i catch my enemies still preparing for battle and after all a backstab to a sitting caster is something to really fear.<br />
