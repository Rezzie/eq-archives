<br />
What if, when you did assist another team PC against a same team PC (Immortal healing/buffing) in PvP, that you WOULD be botted from your team as a race traitor. This would actually create a 5th team, or the &quot;crossteamers&quot; as I like to call them, and put them on the Red team (discord). This means that Team vs. Team would still work them same way, but the Red teamers become FFA targets (can be hit by anyone within the +/- 8 level range, even their own team, etc), and you would never get a faction hit for killing one.<br />
