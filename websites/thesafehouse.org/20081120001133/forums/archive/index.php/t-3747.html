We've beat him using AoE heals and melee, but the fight was alot closer than we'd like.  We've also tried using a Ranged approach, but for some reason that doesn't work for us.  Everyone keeps telling us the Sol Ro encounter is gimp, yet we have more trouble with him than with RZ or even PoFire mobs.  Is there something about him that we are missing, or are we not trying the right tactic? Edited by: latshadow at: 10/6/03 5:00 am</div></div><hr />

 Easy fight if you did Seru or Cursed back in the day when their AE's were actually mean.</div></div><hr />

The first times you probably want to dodge the AE like Grimmlokk said. When your melees get better gear and regen (buff replenishment too) you can start dodging only every second AE and so on until its completely trivial and loot rots. If your tanks ever die you can consider using the wiz spell, Spell Shield since it cuts down the dmg spikes a little. Good luck.</div></div><hr />

If your melees drop like flys in the beginning you missed the damage shield, he has the biggest damage shield i have ever encountered, must be something 100+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_latshadow</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies.  A few mentioned &quot; Dodging &quot; his AoE like Seru or Cursed.  We originally though of doing that, but his AoE is very long range ( 300 ) and it comes in waves of 3.  So my question is, if you dodge the 1st Wave of the AoE... do you miss the last 2 waves or do you need to keep your melee out the whole 3 waves?</div></div><hr />

So for all practical purposes, have melees stay &gt;150 away from MT during all 3 pulses.</div></div><hr />

These classes do like 30 dps with ranged attacks.  So having them in for 60 seconds meleeing (disc) and then dying will be more dps than having them use ranged attacks for 10 minutes.  And as someone already said, use ae heals. If you can't handle his ae damage with ae heals, GL with mobs like blazzax, coirnav, the wise, etc.</div></div><hr />

We also had problems with him getting pushed around by the melees and loosing mt/rt to getting summoned or having to move out of range. We've also had no luck trying to remove the DS from him which makes meleeing rather painful.</div></div><hr />

I can't understand guilds who let their melee stand there doing nothing on this fight, or even let one person die to the AoE.<br />
<br />
AoE is every 48 secs.. so if you time it right you can get a good 30+ seconds melee on him before running back out. and you don't have to run &quot;that&quot; far.<br />
<br />
I usually do the timing for my guild.. MA calls when AoE hits (3rd wave), all melee pile in, I look at my clock, wait until the seconds hand is opposite (ie, +30 secs), call &quot;AOE SOON, ALL RUN&quot;, then wait for MA to call 3rd AoE wave again (in approx 15 secs), and we run back in.. easy.<br />
<br />
Killed him just last night and I did ~100 DPS a sec, without getting hit once by the AoE, and thats incl. the run in and out !! Multiply that 100 DPS up by all your melee, and thats a lot of extra DPS.<br />
<br />
(Fennin Ro however is a different matter.. AoE rampage really sucks.. sacrifice run, lasted 48 secs, doing 5k damage.. suck. ;-()</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, if you're healing ae using mgb heal rotation, why would you bother keeping clerics out of range of the ae?  Unless you clerics have like less than 4.5k hp (3k ae damage would put them at about low hp agro point), you should have no problems..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or just use MGB heals, and melee 100% of the time. You need<br />
to get used to that for Elemental encounters anyway. The<br />
'mark' cleric line cancels out his DS nicely. Really easy fight<br />
once you have some experience with it.</div></div><hr />

It's not a blowable spawn. If you're wiping you can rez and try again. You need to kill RZtW to get to Solusek Ro's area, and if you can kill RZtW, Solusek will be a pushover.<br />

I've seen clerics hit harder than Sol Ro.... okay, maybe not, but his melee output shouldn't be an issue.  LMM has a higher max hit than Sol Ro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues prolly monks.  But definatly rogues. Rogues do approximately 5x as much damage meleeing as they do with range.<br />
<br />
<br />
So realistically even if you never healed them at all, rogues would still do more damage meleeing before they ran out of hitpoints then they would have done doing range for the entire encounter.<br />
<br />
But realistically you can toss in some heals and some hides and why bother?</div></div><hr />

no, every person needs to have all pre-requisite flags to zone up to his room w/o having to be shuttled in.  raid % does work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
melee is best with celestial regen, which is insta cast for no mana so it doesnt mess up the ch rotation, not all clerics have it though. unless you are really strangled for clerics, most rotations can skip a cleric for AE elixir too. fight is much shorter if you let your melee in there, just like for blazzax or wise. we cornerd him just fine close to port up on the left side, maybe you just chose an bad corner or your melee arent keeping an even push.<br />
<br />
melee is better no matter how you look at it though, u simply do more dmg than plucking arrows, even if you got no heals.</div></div><hr />
