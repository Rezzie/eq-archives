[Wed Sep 04 14:20:45 2002] Askarak says, 'Hail, Warder Cecilia' <br />
[Wed Sep 04 14:20:45 2002] Warder Cecilia says 'Greetings, you have made excellent time. We received word that Zordak was gathering his power here, and we still have little knowledge of his true intentions. Scattered throughout these mountains there are small Pearlescent Shards, binding four of these shards together within a Box of Binding should allow me to create a Seal. This seal, when fused with a Swirling Pearl inside Zordak's heart should allow our seers to divinie his true intentions, even after he has been slain. Once you have the seal I will release Zordak, make haste I will not be able to hold him for long.' <br />

Under her robe...</div></div><hr />

Even at 48 clerics a day (max) there will still be weeks of clerics that have already waited months.<br />
<br />
I have a hunch though that she was supposed to be a longer spawn, more inline with the druids 4 (or 12 depending on which board you read) hour one.  Hence the emergency patching.</div></div><hr />

They did need to do something, when a Cleric was created you can get on the list and you would be 60 by the time your turn came up.<br />
I kind of feel sorry for the people who just made the epic though</div></div><hr />
