<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TibisHatter</div><div class="date">03-29-00, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My many travels with Jherek Spiritreaver, a Shaman and fellow citizen of Halas, brought us one day to Dagnor's Cauldron.  We were there to hunt Aqua Goblin Tidal Lords who occasionally carry a Cauldron shell, a component of Totemic armour that Jherek had started questing for.<br />
<br />
I had my own reasons to be there as well.  I had just learned the art and skills of making poison, and had made for myself several vials to put the poison in.  I even had a few ingredients scavenged from various slain beasts but I was lacking suspension.  I knew there are several traders in Norrath who sell this rare fluid, but one was half a continent away in the Karanas while another, Toxdil of the Freeport sewers, wouldn't sell any unless caught at exactly the right time.  In Dagnor's Cauldron was the third, a Dwarf called Conium Darkblade, and visiting him suited me fine as I had other business, delivering a sealed note from Lon the Redeemed of the temple of Solusek Ro.  But that's part of another story...<br />
<br />
Over the next few days we ambushed many aqua goblin mariners, bosuns, shamen and the few tidal lords that we decided we could take on.  During this time I also found that the sandbar serpents that slithered about the area were a good source of poison sacs, with one specimen having enough venom on it to make a full dose of Inflicting poison with some to spare.  We suffered a couple of defeats, mostly at the hands of Digus Lowater, on whom Jherek and I have sworn retribution.  Once we knew the territory better, though, things went well.  Throughout all that time, however, there was no sign of a Cauldron Shell.<br />
<br />
Once Jherek had found that Conium wasn't bothered about buying and selling from us we made several trips over to him rather than back to Kaladim, and it was on one such trip over that we saw numerous goblin corpses littering the shoreline of the central island.  Drawn by curiosity, we saw nearby a group of adventurers in battle with Gundalthur Izuran, another inhabitant of the island we'd noted earlier.<br />
<br />
We could tell that the group was far more experienced in battle than either of us, and we stayed around to have a good look at the battle.  Jherek also wanted to have a look at the Tidal Lord corpses about the area, just in case.<br />
<br />
The battle finished with the death of Gundalthur, and the victors sat down to rest and heal their wounds.  Jherek started approaching the group to ask if he could inspect the corpses when a Tidal Lord ran up behind him and hit him in the back.  Jherek spun around, murder in his eyes and, wielding his Bloodforge Hammer, he started pounding on it.  I started towards the battling pair, Dragoon Dirk ready to plunge into its undefended back but before I got there, a Bosun joined the Tidal Lord.  Jherek knew the odds were greatly against him and decided that flight was the best option, not that I blame him.  With the swiftness of the Wolf he ran, trying to get his bearings so he could head for the Butcherblock mountains.  Equally as swiftly, I followed, to try and delay the others as best I could.<br />
<br />
Around the shoreline of the island he ran, not sure where he was.  Other goblins, scenting a kill in the air, joined the chase.  I tried throwing shiruken at one or other of the chasing pack to try and get them off him, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bulky figure.  An ogre shaman by the name of Omiga, one of the group of veterans we had seen take down Gundalthur, had followed us, seemingly determined to lend a hand.  &quot;Stop Jherek!&quot; he shouted, and, finding a place to stand, he did.<br />
<br />
Jherek stood there, a tidal lord, mariner and bosun in close combat with him with one, maybe two shamen nearby.  Backstabbing the mariner made it realise that perhaps I was a threat to be reckoned with.  Jherek concentrated his efforts on the tidal lord, as did I.  Omiga had to heal Jherek twice and me once, drawing the bosun onto himself in the process, but by this time the tidal lord was flagging.  Cunning tactics between Jherek and myself had it switching between us in confusion until finally Jherek was able to land a killing blow, splitting its head open.  We quickly dispatched or caused to flee the remaining goblins.  They came back to harry us occasionally, but one by one we managed to hunt them down before they could win through attrition.<br />
<br />
By now, Jherek and Omiga were drained of magical essence, and at least Jherek and I were badly hurt, but before we left the island he had to check the tidal lord we slew against the odds.  There, covered in goblin blood, was the cauldron shell he needed.  Wiping it clean, he carefully stowed it in one of his belt pouches.  Then he stood up and howled a cry of triumph.<br />
<br />
It's ironic to think that our caution and care was proving useless, but the fight we didn't want to get into and would not have won but for the help of another gave us the treasure we sought.  But then, being a rogue, I can appreciate these little ironies...<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I may have got some details wrong - the battle was that confused!  Thanks go to Omiga for pulling our chestnuts out the fire!<br />
<br />
Edit was to change a howler in the sig<br />
