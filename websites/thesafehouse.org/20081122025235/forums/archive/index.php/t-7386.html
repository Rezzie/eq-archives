<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure they got similar threads, but I find the official forums load SLOW and have high bandwith and low content.<br />
<br />
Things I would like to see:<br />
1.  Combination powers ala the old marvel feats.  You and buddy combine powers for a greater or niftier looking effect.<br />
<br />
2.  Deformable objects or terrain.  Cars, mailboxes, newspaper machines that explode or crumple.  Temporary potholes when you land from a huge jump.  <br />
<br />
3.  The promised weapon customizing.  Scrappers especially need more looks for their toys.<br />
<br />
4.  Many more needed costume items:<br />
Wings<br />
Claws (scorpion or crab style)<br />
More tails<br />
More helmets, full helms ,hats, and medieval helms <br />
<br />
Armored and Tech chest pieces that have flat areas for logo, or the ability to place the logo off center. Hate having it along a seam or zipper<br />
<br />
Outlandish and weird items like a armored shell, juggling pins, umbrellas, ect.  <br />
<br />
Please add more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A tanker/scrapper combo screams for a 'fastball special', but I don't want potholes for a big jump (Nightprowl is 'catlike', so she lands her jumps lightly).  Deformable terrain is a huge computer performance hog though, so I don't think I'd want it.  Maybe collision detection combined with a bump map would be good (knock a mob into a wall?  A bump-mapped crack will appear in the wall).<br />
<br />
I'd like to see different claws and swords, and I'd also like to see back items (and I don't mean cloaks; I mean backpack/powerpack/rocketpack looking things, possibly with hoses which wrap around and connect to the hero's gauntlets and/or calves).  Wings would be nice, but they'd have to be glide wings, not flapping wings, and they'd have to fold up close to the back when not in flight (making them quite complex to implement).  Bat and bird styles would be the obvious ones.<br />
<br />
There are five tails which I think is plenty (aside from a puffy bunny tail I'm not sure what other kind of tail there could be - maybe a bird tail if wings are implemented), but more full and partial helmets would be nice.  More neck items would be good as well (there's basically just the spiked collar plus a few head items which also cover the neck).<br />
<br />
I think scrappers need one more power set though (scrappers get a choice of two of ten power sets; everyone else gets eleven).</div></div><hr />

<br />
decent animations for melee charecters.<br />
<br />
Ma scrapper is so so but nothing superb.<br />
<br />
mace tanker,katana broadsword and claws are all pretty weak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/who functionality like EQ<br />
<br />
Banks/SG Vaults/etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Customizing weapons (I need a cutlass!!!)<br />
<br />
2. Duster/Trenchcoats with chest emblems on the back not front. And cloaks of course, Backpacks and wings. all could be a 'back' visual selection.<br />
<br />
3. More tails, full animal heads, etc.<br />
<br />
4. Unattractive non supermodel body types. (i.e. pudgy/fat/lanky/old)<br />
<br />
5. Personal space. Maybe not player apartments, but every supergroup really needs it's own headquarters! What's the Fantastic Four without their Baxter Building? Of course it should include a large round table with the group logo in the center and chairs that can be sat in. :)<br />
<br />
6. Ability to pick up things like Cars and throw them at the enemy if you're super strong. Just use the existing mobile objects.<br />
<br />
7. I'd love to see a light ranged power added to some of the scrapper/tanker weapon user sets. Like a throwing dagger for the broadsword set, or throwing your axe and having it return to your hand (ala Thor). Damage should be light for balance purposes. Just a little something for pullers or runners maybe with an effect attached. <br />
<br />
Like the broadsword wielder's throwing knife might do crap damage, but slows the enemy as if it hit them in the leg. Throwing your axe/mace might knock them down, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree on the more costume customization choices - I haven't seen any capes yet,  but the Hellions and Skulls keep saying &quot;Here come the capes!&quot; and &quot;I'm gonna get me a cape!&quot; making me want one even more.<br />
<br />
Of course it will take me even longer to get 'my look' together, but it's worth it :)<br />
<br />
I haven't played long enough or enough different classes to make comments on other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Capes are coming soon rom what I read.  <br />
<br />
I think they need to add bows!  I always like Green Arrow and Hawkeye growing up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bows could be easily added as a replacement or alteration to the assault rifle.  Since most archers in comics rely on gimmick arrows it would mesh nicely.<br />
<br />
    They also need some more options for robotic looks, you can do skinny robo arms and hands, but the leg option is bulky robo armor, and the heads need more options for robo.<br />
<br />
   Trenchcoats, samurai skirts, more medieval or oriental armor, more medieval helmets (I wan't to make a greek armored hero),tabi or sandal footware, flak jackets without sleeves, 3 color options for logos, more techno gear options, shields, paired weapons (would be martial arts or claws alteration look), more insectoid, reptilian, other animal options (who doesn't wanna be the Leapfrog, pudgy hero wannabe?),</div></div><hr />

<br />
In there.  Propel, gravity controllers have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah but it would much more fun to pick up a garbage can or crate and smash it over someones head. :evil</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
top 5 things that should be added<br />
<br />
5. Trench coats / Capes (Symbols on back)<br />
4. Multiple Animations for the same attacks<br />
3. Secret Identities or any costume changes really<br />
2. More weapon options (looks)<br />
1. a /who feature, or at least a feature on the SG window that tells player level</div></div><hr />
