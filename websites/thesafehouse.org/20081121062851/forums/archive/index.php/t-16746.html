<br />
So, I'm starting to think about tradeskilling (gotta plan before you act, don'tcha know :P ) and I've no idea if I want to be an outfitter for making bows and arrows and such, or if I want to make poisons and all... Actually, I'm not entirely sure which direction to go because my knowledge on tradeskills and how they interact with assassins is nil.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Also, can Assassins use poisons?  Or is it limited to other classes?  Is it all rogues, I mean?<br />

If I can be forgiven what might be considered an advertisement, the best place to answer most of your questions would be www.eqtraders.com.  If you can't find what you need on the main site, try a search on the forums.  If that still doesn't get you results, a post in the forums will usually elicit a response. Good luck and welcome to the insanity that is tradeskilling!</div></div><hr />

EQTraders is an old goat like us. No worries there. :)<br />

Thanks for the tip!</div></div><hr />

Complete with cross references and &quot;shopping lists&quot; of all the parts needed to complete a final item.<br />
