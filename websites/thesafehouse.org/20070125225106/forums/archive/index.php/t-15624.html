You pulled a sneak attack<br />
I thought that we were brothers<br />
Then you staaaaaabbed me in the back<br />
Betraaaaayed!<br />
Oh boy, I'm so betrayed!<br />
<br />
OK...I'm nowhere near the required level (hell, I'm only level six), but upon hitting level 15, I want to do the betrayal quest (Qeynos to Freeport: Exile) to allow my Wood Elf to become a Shadow Knight.  I was wondering if there was any information about the Betrayal quests floating around, just for me to look at and preview what I'm going to be doing in this major undertaking.<br />
<br />
Anyone know of anything?</div></div><hr />

and here's (http://uncommonvalor.eq2network.com/betray.html) a walkthrough of the F-&gt;Q quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgie</div><div class="date">11-21-04, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a few questions, if anyone has done this before.<br />
<br />
At what point do you become KoS to your original city? After they kill you or after you gain citizenship in the other?<br />
<br />
I know you have to remove your house items, but do banked items transfer with you?<br />
<br />
And finally, most of the named mobs should be doable with a 17 Crusader, high teens bard and a high teens shaman, correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgie</div><div class="date">11-21-04, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't feel like waiting, so here's a few answers. After you finish the very  bginning of the quest, you're citizenship with Freeport is gone. The guards outside the gate aren't KoS. I imagine I can still go in through the Sprawl and reach Big Bend and the other lesser zones if need be, for banking/mendors and selling loot. Haven't tested that yet, though.<br />
<br />
EDIT: There is no mother!@#$ing boat from Commonlands to Nektulos forest. Yay for running through high agro 24+ mobs.<br />
<br />
EDIT AGAIN: Some locs.. to reach the docks in Nektulos, head to pos 800 neg 200. I HIGHLY recommend following every path you can to get there. It should be in south west corner of the zone. Be very careful, as there are tons of 24ish owl bears on the path that like to eat noobs for breakfast. Once you're in Thundering Steppes, head to pos 250 pos 25. It'll be a cakewalk compared to the forest. In Antonica, simply follow the path out a bit and you'll see a griffin tower. Take it to pretty much the front gate of Qeynos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. empty your house and RELINQUISH ownership...or you find yourself as I am now trying to sneak back in to to relinquish it...still homeless atm<br />
<br />
2. your bank stuff stays in the bank...you just cannot access it until you finish the quest<br />
<br />
3.  hope you like the smell of Trolls and Ogres...as a wood elf assasin I am forced now to live amongst the lager, and smellier of the evil races =)...don't know if everyone gets put in Big Bend,  might be random, but they really need to baithe.<br />

I waited forever for that boat and it never showed up.  Why does that linked guide say there is one?</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming it was written in beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being that so few follow the Freeport/Evil path, it would be of great benefit to the Safehouse to have our own write up on this. Please take good notes and perhaps a few sceen captures and we'll get it posted pronto, with all proper credit of course.<br />
<br />
Actually any of the evil oriented quests would be very cool to have. Too many damnable lighties out there. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can relinquish ownership and move wherever you want.  I'd suggest Temple Street, because gnomes and ratongans rule.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
One very important thing to note though is that although your bank items will be waiting for you in your new city, your shared slots wont be. The shared slots are tied to alignment, not character, so if you leave anything important in those slots, only an alt of your old alignment will have access to them.<br />
<br />
I found this out the hard way sadly. I thought those spots would change alignment with me...</div></div><hr />
