I know this place well and I'll get good feedback here, so I'll bounce this off my steathy pals :)<br />
<br />
I have planned my Troll Thane template out as follows:<br />
<br />
Parry: 10<br />
Hammers: 44<br />
Storm Calling: 45<br />
Shield: 42<br />
<br />
This will spend all of my points. My goal is to have a premiere RvR Thane. Will this do? Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Valarauco</div><div class="date">04-16-02, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I (and I'm sure many others) would be happy to give you feedback, but I am (and I'm sure many others are) not familiar enough with Thane spec lines to offer anything valuable.<br />
<br />
Can you give a little more info on your thought process for each of these, what 45 Storm Calling gives you, etc?  You'll probably get more out of a strategy question than simply a template.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kelliv</div><div class="date">04-16-02, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok well the main point is Shield 42 gives me a skill with a 9 second stun, so that's the idea there. <br />
<br />
I've heard 44 is about as high as one should use for hammer... 44 seems to be the highest hammer skill of any use.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the other 2as high as they are, SC was as high as I could get it, which at 45 I get my last AoE DD spell, so I am compromising there... but I don't know if these choices will hurt me, so that's why I set my stuff as such.<br />
<br />
Also, I've set my stats as 20 QUI (for 50 total quick) and 10 dex for 45 dex. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can eek out the extra point in stormcalling, I'd highly suggest achieving 46, which gets you the highest level damage add.<br />
<br />
42 shields is truly awesome for RVR - anything that attacks you - shield stun first for a long duration stun.  You can then assess and either nuke nuke nuke and melee or get outta dodge.<br />

Decent hammer skill and the rest in parry, all good. Drolk - L43 Kobold Shadowblade (Tristan)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kelliv</div><div class="date">04-17-02, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so I can tap back into parry and get points for 46 in S.C...<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course that puts my parry at like 3 but you can't have everything.  Thanks for the info<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Goatmaker</div><div class="date">04-20-02, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, this is what what I would do ( some of this is a recap of what other people have said, but then you'll just know it's better, right?   ):<br />
<br />
44 Hammer<br />
46 Stormcalling<br />
42 Shield<br />
03 Parry<br />
<br />
+10 STR<br />
+10 CON<br />
+05 QUI<br />
+05 DEX<br />
<br />
STR gives you weapon damage (every little bit counts)<br />
CON gives you hits (and you're a tank)<br />
QUI and DEX just need a little rounding off. I actually heard rumors that there was some some sort of step in gains if you had 50 or more QUI. AIM: rabidferret99  |          got goat?          |  email: rabidferret99@hotmail.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Esc1221</div><div class="date">05-01-02, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my thanes projected 50 spec and he does really really well in RvR...<br />
<br />
SC 48<br />
Shield 42<br />
Hammer 39<br />
Parry 15<br />
<br />
Obviously he uses his shield in RvR to engage (i mostly dont engage for myself as all bolts ive been hit with i laugh at, but archers sometimes hurt a bit).  I mostly use my engage b standing next to a healer in keep warfare and engage/guard for them, this lets them res the dead on the walls as i block for him by looking for snipers draw animation that looks like its comming our way and targeting them.  I usually only do this when im out of mana and waiting to cast some more into the fight.  The 48 SC is the last 3-sec casting DD, the 50th spell is only a str buff of 6 over the previous one.  Usually I dont get in melee as thanes do not have very many HP and i cannot stand up to pure tank types(hero and armsman) in melee unless i hit them with a few spells before they got to me.  As i troll i have plenty of STR and those 6 points just arent worth 99 spec points.  39 hammer is just so i can get it to 50 with items/rp to beat down any stealthers that close in on me into melee range.  and the 15 parry is just a point dump mostly, i block more with shield than parry since you cant engage with parry  <br />
<br />
For stats i went +10 str, +10 con, and either +10 dex or +10 piety is good (i went piety myself).  STR, duh hit harder, +10 HP is good, and the choice of piety or dex..dex lets you block a bit better, but i prefere the piety for spells as our mana is pretty poor and any more mana helps.  <br />
<br />
As a thane truthfully we arent all that in melee range, a pure tank type (and zerkers do too) have some 20% more HP, and do 25% more in base damage on average than a thane can.  But their range ability is nothing compared to a thanes.  With my melee as above, i havent died to a single lone assassin that attacked me while i was fully rested (except once but i was sitting half AFK so it was mostly a stupid thing on my part).  But we get some really useful spells.  The damage is not much compared to robed casters but i will give you a story of a orange con fire wizard i faced 2 days ago to give you an idea what we can do.  I charged up to him in my max range, he warmed his bolt first and i warmed my AE 4sec hammer spell but hit him with my insta DD at that same instant, thus breaking his spell.  Then he tried to warm his bolt again and my hammer came down and broke that.  Then he tried to warm his 4 sec bolt once again, and i used my 3sec DD which broke him.  At this point i had not been hit  and warmed my 4 sec AE hammer and he warmed his bolt with very low HP.  My hammer crushed him to death and his bolt did get off this time and it bounced off my shield    Now at the end of this i had half mana, and i was waiting about 20 seconds for my spells to be able to cast again.  So a thane is good power if you time it right at range, but HIGH mana cost, and just good enough melee to take on an assassin that jumps you.  More than one person at a time and your going to be in trouble though.<br />
<br />
Thanes have good first strike capability as artillery but we expend our firepower very rapidly, so we need to be able to hide behind some group members as we rest.</div></div><hr />
