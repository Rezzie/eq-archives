But I still can't find Sharwyn, Grimgaw or The gnome dudes quest item.  <br />
<br />
Grimgaw needs a weapon blessed by an inner member of his order so he can assasinate an inner member.  And I cant find it anywhere  AAAARRGH.  Sharwyn needs some song writeen by a dead guy, can't find that.  And the gnome needs an undamaged dragon scale.  I killed all the dragons and stuff, no scale, he wont accept a dragon essence or dragon eggs.   I need help anyone know where any of these things are?  I just spent the last 3 hours randomly going over different parts in Chapter 3 trying to find it.  I even stooped to try and find a walkthrough but none of the walkthroughs go up to chapter 3  <br />
<br />
Ah well.  Gonna keep looking for another hour or so then I'm giving up    Gereint the retired CanadRoguish FencerDrunken Bandits</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think it was just in a random chest somewhere, but not too long before kluath.  i remember thinking, &quot;hmm, i don't think there's anything i can make with this and the smithy, but i might as well hold on to it&quot;</div></div><hr />

Grimgnaw needs a dagger found in a chest in Coldwood near Vaath.  (It sells for 0gp).  Finally, Boddyknock's dragon scale is in the Spine of the World in the bronze dragon cave (aka dead dragon) under rubble.
