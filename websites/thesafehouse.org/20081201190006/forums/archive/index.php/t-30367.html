<br />
Ex Umbris (Out of the Shadows) on the Woefeather server is looking for a few good members! <br />
<br />
Ex Umbris was a pre-release guild (our original charter was written early in the summer of 2006). We've stayed strong through the difficulties of launch and now we are looking to add some members with the right stuff. We are a “core” guild that plays the game for fun. We are not casual or hardcore but somewhere in between. Eventually we will be raiding on a regular basis though attendence will not be required. At the moment we are focused on guild harvesting, guild adventuring groups, questing, general crafting and boat building. We have members on all three continents in-game. We are guild that spans the globe with our members currently located from GMT -8 (PST) to GMT +2, (we do not limit recruitment to these time zones) and our level range runs from late teens all the way up to fifty. We are looking for mature, quality players with or without prior mmorpg experience. Our guild’s interests run the gamut: Adventuring, raiding, crafting, diplomacy, harvesting, trading, building a guild town, and ships. We have a guild house (no hall yet) and we are planning to build a hall and a boat when mechanics permit. <br />
<br />
We are working very hard on our web site, and lore. Please come visit, say hi and take a look around! <br />

The basic tenants of eXu lore include: <br />
<br />
-There is a Spiritual Force at work that selects people to have &quot;the call&quot; <br />
-Ex Umbris is thousands of years old and has existed under a great myriad of leaders and has built up an eccentric feel after all this time <br />
-The Ex Umbris &quot;Vaults&quot; were built thousands of years ago when a Dwarf ran eXu. <br />
-Most of the previous generation are finding and selecting our characters and trying to continue the Order. <br />
-Most members are spread out around the world doing what they can to make the &quot;world a better place&quot;. <br />
-&quot;The Call&quot; manifests itself as a driving need to get out into the world and make a difference. <br />
<br />
While we do not require any role-playing we are a role-play friendly guild and have a role-play background. <br />
<br />
We are a big guild with a friendly, small guild feel. If this sounds like a place you could call home stop by the forums and take a look around! We also have an in game chat channel for non-members. If you'd like to visit a bit /join exumbris.<br />
<br />
It's a new day in Telon! Come join us in the light!<br />
