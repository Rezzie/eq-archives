-----------------------<br />
<br />
Aureal based soundcards are not supported. The Aureal company went out of business and sold their assets. No one has written updated drivers to support these chipsets. Try disabling the sound drivers and see if the game will load normally to check if this is your problem. <br />
<br />
------------------<br />
Quote<br />
<br />
The designer and driver developer for this chip, Aureal, has ceased to exist. Creative Technology announced on September 21, 2000 that they would buy substantially all of the assets of Aureal Semiconductor, Inc., including patents, trademarks and other intellectual property. Creative Labs  Craig McHugh last year said in an interview done by MaximumPC made it clear that Creative only bought the intellectual property not the liability. That is they will not sell, support or develop drivers for  Aureal products. Quite similar to the deal between Nvidia and 3dfx. <br />
<br />
As VideoLogic says the current Win9x drivers works well with most games that support DS3D or A3D. However the EAX 1.0 support is limited (only works well with some games)  and there is no support for EAX 2.0. It's also doubtful how it will work with DS3D games that take advantage of new features in future versions of DirectX. The Windows 2000 WDM drivers are beta form and cause problem on many systems but at least on some systems they work fairly well for DS3D and A3D 1.0 games while A3D 2.0 support is more limited. The drivers also lacks EAX 1.0 support. If you use WindowsME we suggest you try the VXD drivers and not the WDM drivers. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cormath</div><div class="date">07-03-02, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends .. SBLive! has front-end architecture problems and 440BX and some VIA chipset boards. Though sometimes reported as a &quot;crackling&quot; noise under Win98, WinXP does not like it and may have random errors and/or not even function correctly. You can run a search engine to find may discussions about this. Try this search sting &quot;sb live crackling&quot;.<br />
<br />
When I first installed WinXP on my Abit-BX133RAID mother board, I had to replace my SBLive! with a SBAudigy to get XP sound to work at all. <br />
<br />
Would suggest if you have SBLive!, you get the latest drivers for XP as soon as possible. Or deal with the possibility of random errors. This is also the suggestion of the Bioware FAQ. <br />
<br />
------------------<br />
Here is a list of links to download drivers for SBlive<br />
All Windows OS driver download site<br />
Windows 2000/XP Driver Download Site<br />
Win2k/WinXP SB Live!/Live! value/5.1 download file<br />
Win2k/WinXP Audigy series download file<br />
<br />
If you have a VIA chipset then try using the latest version of the via4in1 drivers. You can download them form here. <br />
-----------------<br />
Speaking of the VIA (AMD) chipset, if you have an AMD system and are having a soundcard problem, you may want to review this site for help. Tamroc Shamroc,<br />
