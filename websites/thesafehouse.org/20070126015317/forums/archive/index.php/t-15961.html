<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aruyall</div><div class="date">12-03-04, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay Ive done decent so far in PvP slowly finding my own way of fighting each class.  Even without getting the jump on some I can either fight or get away to stalk and try again.<br />
<br />
Spent some time dueling with guildmates of different classes simalar levels as well.  But Mark I can't seem to break.  If I get the jump, Im usually good but if I get marked by a hunter there seems to be no getting away.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? tips?</div></div><hr />

If you have a engineered combat pet use it so hunter cant follow you at your speed... (Hunter Speed buff will daze him fpr 4 secs, once he got hit using this speed buff meanwhile)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aruyall</div><div class="date">12-03-04, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Engineered combat pet?<br />
<br />
Hmm okay please explain?  moving up the ranks quickly, but havent seen or heard of this?  I take it this is something I can by? or if I work enginering can produce?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">12-03-04, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The speed buff is something they are weak in.  If he's higher lvl run away and then turn and shoot, throw whatever to hit and stun him, then run again, and use a swiftness potion if need be to get more distance.  <br />
<br />
If he's equal of lower lvl, slumber sand or net his pet (both slumber sand and sticky glue should be in AH cheap), and maul the hunter.  In hth they can't beat a equivalent power rogue unless you really mess up.  <br />
<br />
Remember, if the hunter dies, the pet poofs (same with warlock), so always focus on him and not the pet.  I see a lot of people die fighting the pets.  Maybe a quick gouge if you need to get if off for a sec.  <br />
<br />
Bummer with mark is it stays even if the hunter dies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely you either 1) Had a bug that did it or 2) the 2 minute timer expired (which it doesn't sound like).  I've tried many, many times to use vanish to drop it.  God would I love that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reinerfore</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few engineered pets that actually fight with you such as the Compact Harvest reaper Kit (about 175-185 skill) and the Gnomish Battle Chicken ( an artisan level recipe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peepers</div><div class="date">12-14-04, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got jumped by lone hunters a few times when I was around level 30, all of whom had 3-5 levels on me. I got away each time (just barely).<br />
<br />
Some things that helped me: <br />
<br />
Sprint as soon as you see that little red arrow over your head. If you're engaged in a fight, gouge the mob first so it doesn't try to daze you.<br />
<br />
You're probably going to be snared with concussive shot as soon as you try to sprint away. The hunter will probably hit you with a dot too. <br />
<br />
You're going to take major damage here as these guys can really dish out from ranged combat, I couldn't have surived without a healing potion. Make sure to have some at all times. Use one as soon you get to around 30% hp. <br />
<br />
After about 4-5 seconds snare will break. As soon as it does, sprint INTO a group of mobs. You're still going to have 10 seconds to run through them at sprint speed and by the time they aggro you you'll have already run past them. However, this'll make the hunter think twice about charging after you, especially with cheetah on.<br />
<br />
As sprint ends make sure you're now clear of any new mobs and pop vanish. It WILL put you into stealth even though mark is still on you, dunno if this is a bug or what, but it does work. All the mobs that were chasing you will lose aggro too. <br />
<br />
From here, just keep moving away from the hunter. Try to find a place with lots of mobs around that you can sneak around in. <br />
<br />
You are now stealthed and he will have a hard time getting close enough to try to actually reveal you even though he can still see you on the minimap. You should be able to wait out the minute or so left on mark.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure when hunters get flare, but this worked for me around level 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">12-19-04, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as a hunter, the mark adds you to our minimap, even if you stealth.  I can't be sure when my rogue foes use vanish, but I've never had a marked rogue stay alive and not be listed on my minimap.<br />
<br />
The minimap thing works for group mates too.<br />
<br />
From a hunter's perspective, if you are running at speed and the hunter is chasing, if you get hit by the concussive (slow) shot you should use any range item you have and shoot them to daze them and continue shooting them until the slow wears off.<br />
<br />
From my experience, I only worry about rogues when they get the drop on me.  Running through monsters and risking your death anyway will make me think twice, however.  Every other tactic by a solo rogue has been counterable.<br />
<br />
Run at me?  I'll str/agi debuff as you run at me.  Run at you and Wing clip when you're in melee range, and continue running.  Send a DoT arrow when out of melee range, and concussion when wing clip runs out.  All while my pet is on you.<br />
<br />
Run away?  Hunters Mark, Tracking, Concussion shot, pet with boosted run speed all make it difficult.<br />
<br />
Currently with my PvE build I'll turn on spirit bond at 50% health, with a 1.2 attack speed pet with 5 frenzy (100% chance of 30% attack speed haste after any crit), with a 5 ferocity (+15% chance to crit) gives me a pretty good HPS rate to eat into your DPS, allowing me time to slow, hit range, and pelt or run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devious</div><div class="date">12-20-04, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Marbh, you mentioned using sticky glue on the pet.  I only know of one horde quest where you can get that stuff.  Is the sticky glue for sale in the AH only from people that do the quest?  Or is it able to be made through tradeskills?  I assumed it would be alchemy since the NPC that you get the quest from is an alchemist, but I haven't found a recipe for it anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">12-20-04, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've only seen it in AH.  Mind you you get it for the quest, so you could run a toon up to lvl 6 or so quick and mail it to yourself, and rinse repeat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Played DAoC as Aruyall for a while, then Lineage (Got sick of fast)...<br />
<br />
And now WoW Horde Troll, Kuzeel on Kel'Thuzad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harvey</div><div class="date">12-21-04, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, hello brother.<br />
<br />
You might recall me from my old bardic name - Jantis (of Bristlebane).  It is great to see you again.<br />
<br />
 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aruyall</div><div class="date">12-21-04, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOw! Blast from the past:)<br />
<br />
Good to hear from you man, BTW Im playing with Manning/Thorgan and a few others from the Old Bbane days and Wolf Pack on DAoC.<br />
<br />
Too bad your not playing a Hrode with us on Kel'Thuzad:) come on over for some fun and evilness:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lurik Crim`Tal</div><div class="date">04-03-05, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing about being marked is it isn't as bad as it seems.<br />
<br />
You've got 1 chance.<br />
<br />
Hit sprint and pick a direction, towards the hunter or away.   I'll always run away unless I already have crippling on my weapons (although my weapons proc root, I don't rely on it).<br />
<br />
If I do have crippling on, I hit sprint and charge toward the hunter, quickly close that gap.<br />
<br />
Now you've got a couple more options.<br />
<br />
Hit vanish and cheapshot (the reason why mark isn't so bad.  It doesn't make it impossible to stealth and use your opener, it just means he gets to watch you CS him) if you think you can do it before he breaks your stealth or you can blind and then vanish so you're certain he won't break your stealth.<br />
<br />
After that lay in like you would normally attack a hunter if you had the first strike.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've never had a hunter freeze trap me in PvP, I guess they get scared that I may see them before they have their chance to attack and never drop it.  So don't even worry about that scenario happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bender</div><div class="date">04-03-05, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, dueling a hunter I win about 50% of the time, but in actual pvp the hunter doesn't get to set everything up the way they want so I win a whole lot more.  Flare and their traps are really hard to beat, and if I want to get away hit sprint, when sprint fades hit my mount and run around for 2 mins then come back and kill them on my own terms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">04-04-05, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Run at me? I'll str/agi debuff as you run at me. Run at you and Wing clip when you're in melee range, and continue running. Send a DoT arrow when out of melee range, and concussion when wing clip runs out. All while my pet is on you. <br />
<br />
Wing Clip does nothing for you when the Rog Cripples you.  The instant you get in melee range, unless he's at 20% health, you've lost 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
Also a quick vanish will eat your Wing Clip or Conc Shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikus</div><div class="date">04-13-05, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">with next patch just hit all the time evasion and kill the hunter like a prarie dog... <br />
<br />
But I guess every honorable rogue wont kill hunters after the first kills any more because this like killingg flies and wont make fun really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LurchOG</div><div class="date">04-19-05, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't see anyone mention this, Restorative Elixers(made by alchemists and obtained via quest line) remove hunter's mark, among other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Platt</div><div class="date">05-14-05, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realize this is a somewhat oldish post, however I thought I would interject and add my 2cents in.  I started a hunter because I wanted something different.  Coming from a lev50 warrior on a PvE server to a hunter on a PvP server, so I had adjustments to make.<br />
Anyways all the points here are valid, except 1.  If I land Mark on you 99.9% of the time you are cooked.  And therein lies the rub, since for the most part rogues are sneaky fockers.   If you seriously dont think that I wont follow you through a pack of mobs to make sure that I kill you, then you are mistaken.  There is a reason why we have Mark and Track. <br />
The best part of my hunter that I enjoy thoroughly is when people or mobs try to escape, because its not happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As lurchOG stated above this item will remove the mark effect<br />
<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/?i=4568<br />
<br />
Anyone can get 5 of these as the quest reward.</div></div><hr />
