Or does the sergeant at arms keep just spitting out the same crappy quest forever?</div></div><hr />

Comp is fubar so I haven't made it off the island yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiiki</div><div class="date">11-16-04, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, currently it does still cycle through.  Think I got every type of creature and then it started repeating....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joonling</div><div class="date">11-16-04, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did it three times and got the same quest each time.  I needed money and had time to kill so it didn't bug me.  It is one of several that are repeatable. Another one is the &quot;Civil Service&quot; one.  The reward on that is 2 s and since I was poor for awhile, it worked out well for me.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing the guy is like the Energizer Bunny of quest givers.</div></div><hr />
