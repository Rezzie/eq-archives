<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bikbuz</div><div class="date">12-24-99, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The day was hot and humid, rain had just finished falling on the common lands near Freeport. Our lone hero walked out of the Inn of Commons and looked about, his dirk wishing to begin battle. He had been hunting wisps for awhile and was making quite a nice amount of money off the flying balls of light. As he began to run twards the guard booth he spotted a little blue ball of light zipping past. Altering his course, Bikbuz hurried to catch the wisp.<br />
  <br />
His Dragoon Dirk slid into the wisps &quot;back&quot; quite easly, dealing out a decent amount of damage. The angry ball of light quickly &quot;turned&quot; and attacked. Bikbuz began to tear into the willowisp, dirk leading the way. The entire time Bikbuz had fought wisps, he could never figure out exactly HOW they hit him so hard. He fliped out his newest weapon, a gnoll hide lariat. He had just recived this weapon from a passing bard in exchange for a dwarven 1 handed axe he had been wielding. He lashed out and struck the wisp, doing decent damage, but nothing amazing. After a short frown, he shruged and kept up the attack. Not long after, the wisp turned &quot;tail&quot; and ran. Bikbuz grinned and back stabbed the ball of light. A small growl excaped his lips as he over shot his target. He lashed his whip again, taking the whip full in the &quot;back&quot;. This was to much for the willowisp, and it fell to the ground, dead. <br />
<br />
A small sigh escaped from Bik's lips as he looted the body. He grinned. As he picked up the wisps body, he noticed that it emited a great aura of light. This was a nice prize. The wisps body had turned into a Greater Lightstone upon its death. This would fetch him a nice price at the merchants and a greater price from a passer by. He stood from his kill and headed back over to the guard station to rest.  <br />
 <br />
As he slumped down, one of the Milita members, Guard Vallon, approched him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hail gnome, a fee is required to pass through this Toll Booth. Today, the fee for you is only 2 silver. We would absolutly HATE to see something happen to you.&quot; Guard Vallon said. A evil smirk appeared on his face. Rumor as abound that the Freeport Milita were corrupt. Not wishing a confrontation with the guard, Bikbuz tossed 2 silver to him.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I wish no trouble here Guard Vallon. Please, return to your duties. My thanks for up-holding your position.&quot; Bikbuz replied. Guard Vallon nodded and headed back over to his post. Bikbuz let out a small contented sigh and closed his eyes. <br />
<br />
*BOOOOOM* <br />
<br />
Bikbuz lept up, his dirk and whip coming to the ready. A quick look around and saw Guard Vallo rushing out to attack a druid in wolf form. Bikbuz had a quick, but fleeting, though of helping the lone guard. This was not a un-common occurance at the Toll Booth. The Milita had to re-stock the guards here quite often. Local toughs were always out killing them. Bikbuz sat down once again, ignoring the battle. He frowned. The noise of the druids spells and the screams of Guard Vallon were keeping him awake.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Blasted druids..&quot; Bikbuz mutterd. He stuck some small bits of cloth in his ears and tried to rest again. To his amazment, the cloth helped. No noise was heard from the guards screams of death or the druids casting. He smiled and wiggled a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello little one.&quot; A light, elven voice said. &quot;I hope that I did not distrub your efforts to rest. My humble appologize for this.&quot; Bikbuz lept straight up a good 5 feet into the air. When he landed he had his dirk and whip drawn once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHOA! Who are you?!&quot; Bikbuz almost screamed at the wolf infront of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Tassaddar, druid of Kelethin.&quot; The wolf grined at him &quot;I am out hunting the vile guards of Freeport.&quot; <br />
 <br />
Bikbuz calmed a bit and sat down. &quot;Well you kept me from my sleep. Thank you for helping but if you woulde excuse me, I am a bit roughed up and need of rest.&quot; He waved at the druid and leaned back against the small hut, closing his eyes. <br />
<br />
Cold peace flooded Bikbuz. He sighed as he felt his entire body mend from his fight with the  willowisp. Standing, Bikbuz bowed to the druid. &quot;My thanks good druid, I am sorry for my tone, It tis just dangerous for you to kill the local guards, we need them to protect us from Griffins and Kodiaks. My name is Bikbuz, rogue of Akanon. Tis a pleasure to meet you Tassadar.&quot; <br />
<br />
 &quot;Aye, tis dangerous for me to slay them, but tis needed. My power is far to great for most of the creatures here, and not powerful enough for a few. Tis nice to meet you as well Bikbuz, may Tunare guide your steps.&quot; With that, the druid cast spirit of the wolf and was off.  <br />
<br />
A few hours later, Bikbuz was once again hunting. He had located a group that were busy killing the local bandits. He slid his dirk from the back of a Dervrish Thugs back as he saw the wood elf druid Tassaddar killing the guards again.He shook his head and lept into battle with a barbarian. Noa few scant moments later, he heard a shout.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ack! Hill Giant on my tail, look out all. I will try and slay it, though there is a guard on my arse.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Bikbuz reconised the voice of Tassaddar and quickly finished off the Derv. He rushed off to aid his druid friend.No longer than a few minutes had passed and Tassaddar ran past, guard and giant in tow. Bikbuz stared in awe of the massive giant. The thing was easly 100X taller than him. He blinked and lept into action. He drew out his bow and notched a arrow. He ran after the trio and launced a arrow into the giants back. He blinked, the giant turned to attack HIM! He screamed like a small gnomish school girl and ran. Looking over his shoulder he noticed that he was leaving the giant in the dust. He spun and fired again, his pin sized arrow taking the giant in the thigh. Another arrow lept from his bow and bounced off the giants tunic. He whinced and ran again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I got he giant off ye Tassaddar, finish the guard and help me!&quot; Bikbuz shouted as he shot another arrow over his shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now why did ye go and do that ye short fool? Hehe, alright. I am on my way, which way are ye running?&quot; Tassaddar shouted back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am running my little gnome butt twards Kithicor forest.&quot; Bikbuz replied. <br />
<br />
He looked over his shoulder and the giant was out of sight. He let out a sigh and slumped to the ground, his energy wasted.  <br />
<br />
*THUD...THUD...THUD..* The ground shook Bikbuz off his kester. He looked as saw the giant bearing down on him! <br />
<br />
 Bikbuz screamed again and lept to his feet, running once again.He peeked behind him and saw red lighting striking the giant. The huge beast roared and turned on the caster, whom Bikbuz noticed was a wolf. He smirked and fired off another arrow, giving chase as Tassaddar ran, giant and gnome in tow.  <br />
<br />
 Twas a long and tedious battle. Bikbuz shot arrow after arrow at the giant beast. A few hit but more stuck in the giants tunic. Tassaddar cast many a spell and finaly felled the beast. <br />
<br />
 It was a amazing time for Bikbuz. He grinned at Tassaddar as soon as the beast thudded into the ground, lifting Bikbuz high into the air.  <br />
<br />
 A few days later, Bikbuz saw Tassaddar running from a Griffin, he chuckled and notched an arrow, giving chase to the foolish druid. <br />
<br />
