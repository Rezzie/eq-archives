<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maximilean</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard a number of people mentioned Chanters as a not-so-hot PVP class, and others suggest that it's a useful and adaptable class, but one that takes a lot of skill.<br />
<br />
What's interesting is that a lot of casters mentioned it as a particularly nasty opponent.  Are chanters dangerous to Rogues, (and by extention, other meleers) or just to other casters?  <br />
<br />
I was thinking perhaps melee classes tended to have too many resists (not needing Wis/Int gear) and too many HP for the chanter to take care of without some elaborate charming scenario.  Are Enchanters limited to &quot;Tashan, stun/mez and run&quot; versus melee classes, or do they have other practical options?</div></div><hr />

The only thing he was getting to stick was Eye of Confusion (there like level 4 blind). He didn't even waste his mana on root heh. My unbuffed MR is 69 I think, and Tash'ed that brought it down to the 50's. Niether of us won, he finally gated. We were PvP'ing in CC and he was getting in all those nooks and crannies bleh.<br />
