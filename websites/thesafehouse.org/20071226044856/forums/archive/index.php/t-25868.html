<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-06-06, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, Gainax is remaking Evangelion. It will be four movies, 1. First Arc, 2. Middle Arc, 3. End Arc, 4. Finale Arc.<br />
<br />
The first arc comes out Summer 2007. It's all new animation and a remade story. I don't have much information that's not rumors to give other than that.</div></div><hr />

Can shinji not be a pansy? Can rei have a soul for more than three minutes without it being torn away from her thus making me even more depressed? Find out next week, same eva time, same eva channel. <br />
<br />
Almost as much as statesman.. *sigh*</div></div><hr />

No you just get to see them depressed in better animation quality and redone wording! :P.</div></div><hr />

Less Asuka, Rei with a semblance of personality, a lot less whiny Shinji...so much good could be done</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-06-06, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was going to let Toprem post it himself, but since he didn't... gonna post it for him. This is a quote from Toprem's post.<br />
<br />
The title for the new film series is &quot;Evangelion Shin Gekijou Ban&quot;, it will consist of 4 parts with the first part arriving in Japanese theaters in early summer, 2007. Staff include General Supervisor: Hideaki Anno, Director: Tsurumaki Kazuya , Character Design: Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Mecha Design: Ikuto Yamashita, Animation Production: Khara (Color) Studio. The scenario of the 1st part will be written by Hideaki Anno with storyboard by Shinji Higuchi. Key points of a supposed interview which may or may not appear in the forthcoming edition of Newtype attributed to Toshimichi Ohtsuki of King Records have also been circulating.<br />
<br />
According to that information:<br />
-The content is quite different though the time base of the story is the same as the original TV series.<br />
- It will be a remake, however, it is not a re-creation but a &quot;new work&quot;.<br />
- The approach will be different than what Tomino-san did with the Gundam Z New Translation films, there will apparantly be a large amount of new material.<br />
- Even if the TV series has not be seen, the viewer will be able to enjoy it. Though the content becomes easy, it is not redundant to those already familiar with the series.<br />
- The technique that purposely scatters difficult words and phrases will not be used any longer.<br />
- As an antithesis to current animation industry segments. It is an attitude on the production side to pull the act in the age that started from Eva.<br />
<br />
What I take that to mean is they intend to simplify the story, and make it more sensical. I think they will change a lot of things, Shinji's character seems like an obvious place to begin.</div></div><hr />

I thought it translated to 'The Search For More Money' ? http://smiley.onegreatguy.net/bounce.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">09-08-06, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought Evangelion was an excellent series and 'End of Evangelion' was great, though I didn't like 'Death and Rebirth'.  I could see the logic in releasing the remastered platinum series in 5.1 surround sound, but all these other things seem to be money grabs.<br />
<br />
I think I soured on all 'new' Evangelion things while reading an issue of Newtype a while back.  Near the back of the magazine I saw a full page ad for an Asuka figurine dressed in a maid's outfit (here's (http://www.diamondcomics.com/toychest/toys/06_05/32_nge.htm) the figurine.  The call it 'loli/goth' but it looks more like 'french maid').<br />
<br />
I still really like the old series, but I'm weary of new stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-08-06, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering, why did that figure sour you on Evangelion? I own that figure (the only Asuka figure I've ever liked and bought, aside from the Grimrock set.)<br />
<br />
While they make royalties, Gainax doesn't make the figures themselves. The goth loli Asuka and Rei are doujin creations. Just wondering. Also, that figure is most definitely Goth Loli, which is different from the maid outfit. Goth Loli is a fashion style that's VERY popular in Japan. Saturdays in Shibuya will show tons of girls dressing up as Goth Loli. There's several magazines about the fashion alone, the most popular being EGL (Elegant Goth Loli) and it has it's own sub-fashions. For more info, see this wiki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_fashion).<br />
<br />
I'm far more forgiving of the figures that are created by doujin groups then mass-manufactured. I am also weary of Gainax milking the series, but I personally find this to be potentionally worthwhile. Depending on how they do it, of course.</div></div><hr />

Heh best Asuka figure I ever seen. But the photo in the link doesn't really do it justice.<br />
<br />
Errr Ruccus's link...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">09-08-06, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it soured me because it took Asuka out of Evangelion and used her in a manner completely unrelated to Evangelion; they just used the Evangelion name to sell the product.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I should say I think the figurine itself looks fine, it's just not in character with who she is any more than putting Motoko Kusanagi in the same outfit.</div></div><hr />

Don't most figures from series do different types of styles that don't relate to the anime? I dunno if thats true just a question :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-08-06, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, I see. I'm a big doujin fan so I'm used to seeing various anime characters acting somewhat out of character. I think it's part of the charm, seeing the mostly tsun tsun Asuka be all out dere dere, or Shinji acting manly for a change, etc. In this case, gothloli Asuka feels like &quot;Here's Asuka, if she was a regular Shibuya girl! Outside of Evangelion.&quot;<br />
<br />
All a matter of preference.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sollion's question.<br />
Not most figures, but a lot of figures do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-08-06, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few new details regarding the new Eva project, Evangelion Shin Gekijou Ban from the October, 2006 Japanese edition of Newtype Magazine:<br />
- The cover illustration featuring characters Ayanami Rei Nagisa Kaworu is by Shunji Suzuki. Suzuki had worked on the Shin Seiki Evangelion TV series as chief animator and on the End Of Evangelion movie as an animation director. Although not officially connected by name to the new project as yet, his image appearing on the Newtype cover would suggest involvement.<br />
- Images released so far depict Rei Ayanami in observably more provacative and animated moods than before. How will she change? The silent and submissively naturered character with her trademark blue hair and style made her an all time fan favorite of otaku everywhere, catapulting her to the top of the monthly Animage character poll for many, many issues.<br />
- From Toshimichi Ohtsuki's interview: Just before this new project started up director Hideaki Anno rewatched the entire original television series back to back. Ohtsuki relays that he heard Anno say for the first time: &quot;Eva is interesting, I did not think it was so interesting (laughing).&quot; The comment almost broght Ohtsuki to tears.<br />
- Ohtsuki goes on to say that it is true Eva has become a smashi hit animation. However, it's success caused misunderstanding and disarray has arisen in the animation field because of it. An overproduction of inferrior works was caused.<br />
- Ohtsuki says the Newtype cover image featuring Rei and Kaworu symbolizes the new movie project. Japanese fans have questioned whether this is a hint at Rei And Kaworu's possibly being at the center of the new story or getting expanded focus in the course of the story of the films.<br />
<br />
New information on Evangelion.</div></div><hr />

Re-Take by Kimigabuchi  (warning: ero content)<br />
 <br />
I highly suggest checking it out. The story takes place after the end of the anime, yet still manages to not only make sense, but be a new ending that isn't stupid.</div></div><hr />
