<br />
But then I played a game on my computer called Planescape: Torment.  Perhaps the greatest work ever created in the medium of video game.<br />
<br />
It really changed my mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It even beats Dragonlance and FR.. although you can't really say that, as PScape allows you to play there, too!  <br />
<br />
And the art in the books is simply cool. ShadowCross Bladesong<br />

<br />
I agree that Planescape torment was the best roleplaying game ever. (welll... Daggerfall...) I have my reservations, however, about a setting where you can visit the afterlife as a matter of course. It removes any consequences of death when you can pop over to Celestia and say hi to the dead guy every tuesday evening.<br />
<br />
Also, it means you can visit the Dragonlance setting, which is a big, big minus by any measure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally wrong. Sorry, but that's not right.<br />
<br />
A dead soul that becomes a part of the plane usually has little or not memory of it's former life at all, so yes, death DOES have consequences. Not to mention the fact that they (except for extremely rare cases) can't leave their plane and that they are purely living their alignment now, as the strive to become one with the pure alignment &quot;force&quot; is the only reason for their existance.<br />
<br />
So yes, you could pop over ot Celestia and say &quot;Hi&quot; to the dead guy every tuesday evening. So? What use would you have from it? Except getting a new friend that happens to look like someone you knew before he died? Which wouldn't be guaranteed at all, since most often they majorly change appearance - into animals (Beastlands), Larvae (Lower Planes) or whatever. He doesn't remember you (at least the first time, he might (!) remember you the following times).<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides, I don't think that the consequences of dying are really present in D&amp;amp;D anyhow... any group of characters that has passed at least a certain level (roughly 6-8 ) can easily afford to ressurect a fallen comrade. Not to mention that later still they even can do it themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I went to visit my parents the other day I managed to rummage through the attic and find the Planescape box set.  It's still one of my favorite settings.  Planescape, Ravenloft, Dark Sun...I loved them all because they were so different than the traditional fare. Plus, tieflings are nifty.  <br />
<br />
My Fiance bought me Planescape: Torment for Valentine's Day.  What a great, great game.  I had been trying to find it for awhile after I played Baldur's Gate 2...I highly reccommend Torment; one of the few games I've played where you can think your way through problems, as opposed to killing them all and letting  sort them out.<br />

<br />
Who knows if Planescape will be in Third Edition. Is Sigil mentioned in the new Manual of the Planes?<br />

<br />
No more 18 elemental planes.<br />
No more Outlands &amp;amp; Sigil.<br />
<br />
A LOT of other changes too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And my complaint stands. Regardless of what happens the fact that everyone knows what happens removes any mystique and mystery in death. Also, I for one find the fact that there is no actual survival after death to be just a leeetle bit of a depressing worldview.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">02-28-02, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, didn't notice it when I checked yesterday, as it is listed as &quot;Concordant Domain of the Outlands&quot; instead of just &quot;Outlands&quot;.<br />

*shrug* I guess it's personal style. Nothing that is right or wrong then.   *hug*</div></div><hr />
