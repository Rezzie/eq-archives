Then, when ya got those down, try to learn how to fake someone out. Like lunging forward barely out of their range then moving back so they waste a swing or two. Then jump on'em right away. Open with a damage poison, it'll eat the monk up. They got crap for HPs.</div></div><hr />

Your ok ghecko is 3 levels under you. The root slow is good I personlly like a good weeken verse monks. Kinda messes with that 15 lb weight limit they have and also kinda snares them. &quot; No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife between the shoulder blades will seriously cramp his style&quot;  -- Vlad Taltos</div></div><hr />

I'm tellin' ye, folks.  Potions are th' chit in pvp.  Resists is king, but Potions an' poisons gotta be royal in some way too.  Course, if th' monk is smart, he'll be buyin' th' same stuff.<br />

Never hurts. Wait, then again, I have never tried one either ;p<br />

1. We were in a hurry and had to fight at zone line in com<br />
2. Monk sat in wall so I coulnd't get in a bs<br />
3. Guild leader died and was bound in com and wanted to see duel before getting ressed so no times to go buy poisen stuff.<br />
It was a close fight.  I almost kill him after his mend...but I still was accepted into guild, I found out moving around a lot worked, I had his weapons almost all timed out for a while.</div></div><hr />

Load up your old DoT(mine does dmg in the 800 range with 248 skill) it will haste him slighty. but with that DoT on him he will move from that corner, make him run after you, hide apply root/50% slow hit him with it and ownage is all yours. if he doesn't move from the corner with the dot on him apply the root/slow then pelt him with arrows/daggers till he decieds its not worth it to stand still</div></div><hr />

Use a bow if if against a monk so their shurikens can't get ya.<br />
