By that I mean stunning visually with nicely scripted encounters.   Scarlet Monestary is now my favorite instance over the Deadmines, although it does leave something to be desired loot (rogue loot) wise.<br />
<br />
So, why the hell was I wasting time in it if the loot sucks for rogues?  2 answers; a guild group was going and I had a quest that would require all 4 heads from the heads of the monestary. (haha, I'm funny)<br />
<br />
The encounters themselves were very cool, I'll detail them in a lower post and link pictures as well.  So stop reading below this post if you'd like to avoid spoilers.  I encourage you to avoid them and experience it for yourself if you're in the level range where it would be a task and achievement to complete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now for Quest loot... you get  Black Menace as your reward for the Main Quest in SM.<br />
<br />
It's a 22ish DPS dagger... pretty nice.  I'm level 39 and still using it.  Just got a Widowmaker to take over my main with BM going to off-hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only 2 items I'd use as a rogue (not even rogue loot, just items I'd use).  There are some pauldrons that add str and then an extremely rare dagger that is 18.6dps and +intel.  I take that back, the dagger is too underpowered for easily attained alternatives at that level.<br />
<br />
Black Menace is also what I'm using and why I was there.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW:  Purchase the Widowmaker or loot it?   I've thought about buying one, but that'd dip into my mount savings by about 20g.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new patch added rogue talents.  Rogues became even more popular to play and more rogues were created thus increasing the demand for more daggers.</div></div><hr />

Bunchof buddies of mine are like 10-15 levels higher than me because real life keeps intruding into my game time :angry   <br />

We were in Stormwind last week and he ran up and dropped it to me in trade.. I was like... WTF?  Nice!!!<br />
<br />
Gave me a reason to get to 39 hehe</div></div><hr />

I didn't even look through all the drops, those are just the first 2 blue daggers I see.<br />
<br />
I can't wait till I get a SM group, the loots are very nice, including the 29dps sword you get for getting all the heads for Varmitharas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those are (I think) the only two daggers in SM. The second is decent, but the first is mediocre. The first is of course a standard drop to a boss, and has horrible stats for a rogue. The second, while much more appealing, is so rare that even if you run the entire instance 10 times you are VERY unlikely to come across it. <br />
<br />
Itemization for rogues is horrible right now. Probably will remain so. I have slightly more AC than the cloth casters in our group and less hitpoints than them. It isn't because they are broken or imbalanced. It is due to there being almost no blue rogue items in the game anywhere. <br />
<br />
I am sure it will change in time, but wearing the westfall quest tunic (roughly level 20 although I think I got it at 18) until level 46 is frightening. I can only hope that not everyone is sharing my nightmare with that sort of wait for item upgrades.<br />

jk seriously I finished the set at level 25 and wore it until level 41. I now have the living fungus bp from Marudon.</div></div><hr />

I cant wear the boots or pants yet.  41/42 level requirement but I have them in the bank for when I can.  Some decient rogue items.  Each has over 13 points of agility buff to them.  And the boots add a level of stealth as well.</div></div><hr />

I spent a whole 2g the other day at the AH upgrading some slots just to Monkey gear and gained around 200hp without sacrificing any AGI.   <br />
<br />
Even without too many blue+ rogue drops SM is a pretty fun instance - I really enjoy it still.   Whenever a friend and I are bored we do a quick duo run through the library.  The quest out of Desolace/Stormwind certainly results in a nice blue sword or dagger as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">01-11-05, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yaknow, Everybody has been telling me SM is where the money is at.  I went in there the other day for cash and I ended up spending more on repairs then I got from them in loot.  Most of the time I was picking more loot out of their pockets then if I was just killing them.<br />
<br />
So I went back to Stranglevine and PP/Killed trolls.  Got MUCH better loot and it took half as long.  Maybe im just not doing the right thing in SM.  (Though I will admit I got about 12 pts of lockpicking witch was nice)<br />
<br />
I went to SM the first time specificlly for the dagger on that SW/Desolice quest.  Black Menace is a rather nice dagger. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
never had or seen either of these. the main reason to go to SM (as far as im concerned), well the 2 main reasons:<br />
<br />
if you want a dagger, kill doan, he drops hypnotic dirk. caster stats, but 26ish dps.<br />
<br />
the main main reason that i was interested, was for sword of omen. 29ish dps sword, either hand usable, and with agi/str/sta.<br />
<br />
granted sword of omen quest is given by the head dude in UC, so im not sure if there's an alliance version or not.<br />
<br />
if there isnt, ha ha alliance!<br />
<br />
(just kidding)</div></div><hr />

We can choose a 30dps sword or a 29.7dps dagger. In addition to getting my Black Menace, I got a Hypnotic Blade my first time in the Library too.</div></div><hr />
