The people present were near fully elemental geared with a substantial amount of AA's. We cleared what seemed to be like most of the zone; leaving only the three 'tethered' mobs up. First, we tried to engage one mob, then once it was slowed and under control, we moved to the next, etc, till we came to the last. this seemed to work well, as we engaged the mummy first, then werewolf, then shadow. We had the shadow down to about 45%, and I believe 4 adds spawned, at 45% he regened back to full heatlh; while we were killing the adds. eventually this sucked so we moved out and let them reset and devised a new plan. we then moved the warrior (me) to the werewolf for flurry/dps/mana purposes. the shadowknight was on the mummy, and the paladin was on the shadow, still. we engaged the werewolf and tried to kill it first, we did get it down to 75%, then it healed, we failed the adventure, and were booted after 30 minutes of trying things to kill them. anyone know how this cycle works? or what we're doing wrong, if anything; or if it's just bugged. Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Yella01</div><div class="date">10-30-03, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did an exploratory run against this raid a while back and figured that the strategy you tried was the best guess on how to beat it. It's interesting that it didn't work. The regen is associated with an emote about the mob drawing power from somewhere, if I recall correctly. I wonder if they have some sort of health sharing thing going on, it seems likely given the emote. It would be interesting to know if the zone had been completely cleared except for the 3 bosses, or if there was anything else up. If the one you were fighting regened that quickly, all 3 were engaged and there were no other mobs up, I suppose your options are to either kill it faster (is this possible?) or damage all 3 at a uniform rate. There has to be a way of stopping the regen from happening, and it presumably involves engaging or interfering with the 3.<br />
<br />
Another possibility I suppose is that they have to be killed in a particular order. The shadow regened at 45%, the werewolf at 75%. Did you try the mummy first as well? perhaps there is an order to the amount of health they can draw, and maybe the Mummy has a longer period between regens than the other two. If there is, it might be something like kill the Mummy, then the Shadow, then the Werewolf. The treasure chests are just outside the Werewolfs room, so that might indicate that he should be last.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Yella01</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, it could be that it works that way, they regen after a set interval to whatever the highest health of the 3 is. So, if you are doing all your damage on one, but not the other two, they all regen to the highest common denominator, ie max health</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_core1024</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There may have been one additional mob up in the zone, under the floor according to our trackers - we searched the zone (breifly) for it, to no avail. I was one of the pullers, and we cleared every room before moving on, even though we weren't sure we had to.<br />
We tried killing the shadow first (with the most success) and then the werewolf first; we didn't have time to try killing the mummy first, but with no real reason to kill any over the others, I suspect that that's not the right way to finish anyway. The werewolf seemed to be far nastier than the others, possibly because of flurry.<br />
R.e. the mob healing - I'm not sure how far down we go them all at once, and it's possible that they regen to the max health of any of them, but there's something else going on as well - we beat on them for a couple mins at least before any damage was really done (basically hovering at 99%), and when the shadow started to go down, it went down reasonably fast - they must have had a huge regen effect for a while, in addition to the emote, that stopped for some reason, allowing us to do what little damage we managed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lave</div><div class="date">11-24-03, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the FV server we (Fire and Fury) have beaten this raid twice now.  We failed the first time figuring out how it works.  It is simple in theory, but a bit more difficult to carry out.  The first step is to clear most of the dungeon up to the three boss mobs.  When they are the only ones remaining, split your army into three parts and send each to a boss.  You will want to distribute your raid force into relatively equal dps output.  There are a few catches, however.  The shadow boss, for example, has considerably higher armor class than the other two, so you will want to use mainly caster dps on this one.  The other two also have weaknesses/immunities.  After engaging the three at the same time, one person from each section would call the health percentage of their boss mob.  If one group is killing too quickly, have that section lighten up on the dps.  However, there is a minimum dps that must be maintained to keep the boss hp from reseting.  So don't stop attacking if you are way ahead of the other groups... just slow down a bit.  It takes a bit of time to get your groups right, and we had to send members back and forth to control dps accordingly.  Try to keep the bosses within 10% health of each other.  We haven't determined the exact threshold, but it is somewhere between 10% and 19%.  If at any time their health is beyond this threshold, they will imediately reset to full life.  Fortunately, the mobs don't do too much damage and you can leave the rooms to regroup if need be.  It takes some patience but after a few tries you should be able to take them all down.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would like to give this a try and see how we fare</div></div><hr />
