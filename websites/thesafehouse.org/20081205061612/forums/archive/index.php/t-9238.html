<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greldek</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I was soloing with my scrapper today, minding my own business, and go to attack a group of 3 enemies.. easy fight. And notice as I'm finishing the 2nd that some blue rays are coming in sniping my 3rd. Ok whatever, that happens all the time. Don't even think about it, and run around looking for more to kill. Find some nice undead, a group of four, and 1 of them was a LT. I attacked him first.. Mr Blue Rays takes out the other 3.. WTF.. run off to a different area to hunt.. a big group that looks pretty easy, have a few healing inspirations so figure I can make it through all right, as well as my own healing ability. Soon as I run in, blue ****er AE's the **** out of them and I get only 1 kill of 6 or 7.  I turn around and tell him to **** off.. but in nicer words.  He tells me he's helping me.. I tell him to go help someone that needs. And run off.. ****ing everywhere I go this choad muncher is there ganking mobs that are beating on me, cause he's too much of a ***** to fight anything himself.<br />
<br />
Finally I lost him, or he got bored of following me while I was trying to lose him. And went back to fighting.. about 10 min later I see the ******* doing it to some tanker. And boy was that tanker pissed, he was spamming what an ass this guy was in broadcast and telling him to go screw himself... don't remeber the douche's name though.<br />
<br />
Then I went to fight a big group of evens, and right as I engaged I see another blaster run up, and think to myself &quot;**** not again..&quot; but he just sat there and watched then congradulated me when I won. (after using all my inspirations, my heal ability, and still barely winning :) ) and we chatted for awhile afterwards. Wish I woulda wrote his name down too.. I think I'd rather spread the name of a good guy than the name of an *******, they'll get on peoples badside fast enough anyway; but always nice to know the names of people that don't suck :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dark Miasma may not be a very popular powerset, but it's much more valuable then people realize.  The rez is insane and the damage debuff is cheap to keep up and very effective.  I guess it just doesn't have the 'in your face healing/damage' numbers that other powersets have.   :beatup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate people that think they have to &quot;help&quot; me. Blasters are the worst. They annoy me - I can't tell you how much I hate them.<br />
<br />
Engage a group of 3 whites, 6 blues, or 10 greens - doesn't matter. Every single time I am guaranteed that some blaster or even a group of players will come by and try to &quot;help&quot; me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, no big deal, tell them politely &quot;Thanks, but I don't need your (think: ****) help!&quot;<br />
<br />
Look for the next group engage - WTF, the same group/person I just told I don't need help interferes again? **** **** ****<br />
<br />
It's mostly Blasters, 95% of the time. And I am fairly sure I know why: They are too stupid to engage mobs theirselves. They need someone to keep the group busy so they can snipe off some mobs from your group to get exp while you do the work.<br />
<br />
I never ever had a scrapper or tanker engage a villian of a group I was fighting. It's ALWAYS Blasters, Defenders and Controllers.</div></div><hr />

I hit the mob with Crushing Field, which lifts it up and holds it in place stopping it from fighting back.  Never had a complaint so far ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My alt is an illusion controller, and I often help people by throwing a sleep on their enemies, or dominating a runner so he stays put.  But that's about it.  I try not to add dmg unless it's obvious they're in danger.<br />
<br />
But MAN OH MAN do people love to jump in on my kills.  Just because they see a guy standing with a bunch of sleeping mobs around him, they think I'm in trouble or something.  It's very annoying because when I play my scrapper I never have people jump into my battles...so I know it's just that they don't recognize the play-style of a controller.<br />
<br />
/sigh  The way I have to view it though is that in the world of heroes, I'd expect one hero to help another at any time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legna</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a few people &quot;help&quot; me. In general it is just people trying to be nice. I always thank them for helping, regardless if I needed it or not.<br />
<br />
With my newest skill I should almost never need help anymore, which will be nice. <br />
<br />
If I see someone fighting, I stand by and watch them. If they look too deep, then Ill help. Usually if you stand in plain view they will use a heal or something so you know they are ok.<br />
<br />
The lack of PvP is annoying when it comes to dinks, but nothing you can do. Just bounce around until you lose them, or go do a mission so they can't follow you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually don't help anybody else out unless they ask for it (or it's obvious they need it), but I can passively help out your average scrapper quite a lot.  Heck, all I need to do is turn on shadow fall and stand near you to give you a defense boost, and if you really need it I can damage debuff the mobs (I've yet to try that though, I wonder if the damage debuff modifies experience gained at all, I wouldn't think so but you never know).<br />
<br />
Even as a defender I feel your pain though.  My problem is that it takes me long enough to take down bad guys that some people automatically think I'm in trouble when I'm really fine.  I've only died once soloing and that was when I said 'screw it' and tried to take on an orange boss solo (would have had him too if he didn't keep disorienting me!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a tank, I love helping people.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can stand there watching, and if he gets in trouble hit Provoke... boom, no more trouble for him :)<br />
<br />
Then stand there while they beat the mobs down or get a heal.  So far I've had nothing but gratitude from doing it that way since I don't take any xp, they have a lot less problems killing it, and it doesnt generally put anyone else at risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Marbh and I actually had a weird thing happen to us yesterday.  We were on the rooftops in Kings Row and saw a guy fighting three mobs.  He was outclassed and looked to be in trouble.  We jumped over to his roof and I put the mobs to sleep so he could finish them off.  Instead, the guy finished the one he was one, and then walked away and stood at the edge of the roof, looking away hehe.  When the last mob woke up he attacked Marbh, and the guy just stood there.  Never said a word either way.  Very weird and funny.<br />
<br />
Which leads me to a new fun thing I DO know that I can use against people who piss me off in Kings Row (or anywhere really).  There is alot of rooftop jostling.  People generally KS all the time up there.  But in return, I can follow them around and use Gale to blow the mobs off the rooftops hehe.  They go flying in all directions, pretty much ruining any chance of chasing them all down, if any of them.  If someone is really upsetting me elsewhere I can also use Gale to keep blowing their mobs down the street.  It does very little dmg, and is very annoying to melee types...but funny too.  Haven't had to do this yet, but it's an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a fairly large difference between someone trying to help you in passing and someone (like in the first post) using you as a tank so they can snipe exp from the group you're fighting.<br />
<br />
First time, give them the benefit of the doubt.  Third time call in a grav controller to dim shift every mob the guy targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legna</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Morvan, usually if I am fighting and someone comes and sleeps the mobs, I won't attack any more if they look like they are going to engage them.<br />
<br />
Ill finish the mob I am on, and let them take the rest. The world is full of crime, no reason to fight over who gets to punish a couple of baddies.<br />
<br />
The first post was about someone who isn't normal. Just trying to be annoying. Sucks, because there is really no way to deal with people like that.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I usually will say something like, &quot;That should make it a little easier for ya.&quot;  So they know I'm not butting in, just trying to help.</div></div><hr />
