if so, i would go with Ironwood... or if youre wanting it to be a little more special, make something up and add some flavor.<br />

Like, strongest tree on Toril? Or does the question include all other realms that would normally be accesable through the FR playworld, like the Planes, as well?<br />

That would include every fantasy campaign setting ever made by TSR/Wizards (Greyhawk, Dragonlance, Ravenloft, Dark Sun, Planescape, etc ....)   <br />

Going to the planes is an inherent aspect of the world via Plane Shift spells and the like. Going to other worlds like Greyhawk etc is highly unusual, to say the least, and pretty much only happens when a GM makes it happen for his own reasons. <br />
<br />
Any midlevel priest might wake up and hop on over to Elysium for breakfast. Other worlds, no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone that is able to enter the Etheral or Astral Plane can move to other Prime Material Planes... and that's what all the Campaign Worlds are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
uh uh. I'm not sure about 3e, but in 2nd edition at least dragonlance, ravenloft, and I think dark sun were most definitely out of standard planar travel reach. <br />
<br />
ravenloft could not be traveled to by anyone EXCEPT those the mists allowed in. dragonlance was the same sort of deal, where nobody was allowed (except in one not-so-cannon novel case) there that didn't already live there, by the gods. and dark sun, I think, was yet another world disconnected from the standard planar/planescape cosmology.<br />
<br />
faerun and greyhawk were really the only two connected to the big picture. and in the 3e FRCS I think they stated that their new standard planar cosmology doesn't include any other &quot;prime&quot; realms, so no more going from FR to greyhawk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-15-03, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2e babble here..<br />
<br />
Greyhawk, Darksun, Forgotten Realms, Birthright, all of them, are total and seperate realities.<br />
<br />
Each campaign represent the Prime Material Plane on the diagram of the universe. And each campaign setting exists as the prime material in it's own reality. It has(if you want) it's own Elysium, Abyss, Ethereal, Astral. Ravenloft is the exception. Ravenloft is actually it's own seperate plane of existance, the demiplane of dread. It mentions in the Ravenloft books that travel to other campaign worlds IS possible from ravenloft, because Ravenloft can bend reality to grab anyone from any campaign universe, conversely, it can dump them in any universe.<br />
<br />
So you essentially have 2 options. Each universe exists in it's own seperate reality, OR, only the prime material plane exists in seperate realities, all the other planes exist simultaenously throughout reality, going to Elysium from Dragonlance and going to Elysium from Dark Sun will land you in the same place at the same time. <br />
<br />
Now, as a GM, you can give players the power to travel through reality. A carefully worded wish spell might allow it. But there is no spell or ability in 2e that specifically lets you travel in such a way. There may be planes of existance that can be accessed by planewalk or what have you, but those planes of existance still exist within a singular reality, of which there are many. <br />
<br />
As far as the original topic, I read it as trees centric to the FR setting. I don't dig on FR, so I kind of assumed they had their own special kinds of trees. Maybe you are just asking for fantasy type trees and wood from all sorts of stuff? Like Heartwood, and the Lorien trees from Lord of the Rings?  &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls.

they have to reverse its age back to the point when it was made of wood, not stone, before killing it to get the wood ^.^</div></div><hr />

Of course, with a little DM creativity, you could line up a really nasty monster for the party, and present them with a weird situation...<br />
<br />
You kill the golem and proceed to chop his leg off for use in making {thing}. As the limb seperates from the body, the color slowly fills back into it, and new brances with buds sprout out of the piece of wood.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking a 20 hit die monster with 35+ AC<br />

That will make your PCs crap in their pantelones. You could also give the golem some druidic powers, entangle, plant growth, call lightning. <br />
<br />
In any event, you read my mind on his stats. Except I was thinking blunt should be full damage, pierce none, slash 1/2.</div></div><hr />

Trust me, i know.  I've played a level 20 melee.<br />
<br />
Prenn's idea about the time reversal is pretty king, too - although the leg of a petrified wood golem is arguably not the strongest tree available.  The limb of the Tree of Ages in the sealed ancient cavern on the Plane of Earth would probably be a better choice.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">09-19-03, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's right about golems... I went with the golem trend just because of the petrified part. You could go with some sort of petrified treant creature just the same. I don't think Lisboa's game is set for hugely epic chars, but I might be wrong.<br />
<br />
If you do go with a living plant creature, don't make it immune to cold... trees very much die from the cold. If it's some sort of inanimate object like a golem, then sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here. A long, long time ago a powerful transmuter slew an ancient treant and used the wood to fashion a wood golem. said transmutor eventually died (or did he?) and the golem eventually became petrified.<br />
<br />
heh, this is shaping up to be something someone could run as part of another campaign. You have this infinitely old, now devoid of power due to being petrified wood. Devoid of power in the crafting sense, the petrified juggernaut is going to kick some ass. The golem must be magically de-aged to harvest said wood. A society of  terran/sylvan guardians, perhaps those who so long ago failed to protect the treant, want the wood back for holy artifact purposes. Some malevolent/profiteering entity wants the wood to craft. The party can sell it to either or make something for themselves, with different dangers all the same. And of course, the creator of the golem can't really be dead...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-19-03, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could take a second spin on that, the golem is construct made straight from nature(I'm a big fan of violating spell caster class boundaries when crafting stories), like a druid's golem. For some reason, later, the golem has been corrupted and driven mad, his touch which could give life to plants and animals now turns their bodies to solid stone. <br />
<br />
I like Prenn's idea about a group of golems, i.e. sylvan protectors, but if you want to go with the oldest/strongest wood idea, it's more plausible to make it just one golem, not many, otherwise that would have to be one massive tree, or an entire grove of uber strong trees that everyone would want. As a wizard, with limited resources, I'd dump my power into one basket, one massive golem that is hard as @#%$ to kill. <br />
<br />
You could also just make a quest item of sorts to restore the golem's body, Water of Restoration, something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">09-19-03, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Small nit, I was thinking terran or sylvan guardians such as xorns, dryads, druids, pixies, other 'natural beings/servants/spirits of nature.' Like the guardians of the grove the treant was in before he was assassinated, or a local/continental/world wide nature society. Not group of golems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">09-19-03, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, good idea about the water of restoration.  I'm leaning towards a 15/- melee damage resistance plus 100% vs. piercing.  <br />
<br />
I think although some trees are vulnerable to cold, a big redwood isn't going to be, so that's why the 100% cold resistance.</div></div><hr />
