<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Deluin</div><div class="date">05-21-00, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Deluin stepped out of the shadows and faced the brute before him.<br />
He was a barbarian - huge musculature, stature than commanded authority amongst men and beast alike.  Although he wreaked of ale and stale meat, his eye's met Deluin's slyly.  They both nodded at one another - Deluin knew that something important was going to happen.  He wouldn't be called into the presence of one of the most skillfull thieves on this world for no reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;My friend, you know I've battled through forty odd ranks to reach where I am.  I've seen more adventures in this place than most will see in a lifetime.  I've stolen more than my share from the rich, and even more from the poor.  But alas, as time passes, so do morals I surmise.  I have called you hear for a reason.&quot;  said Yarg Spinesplitter, the glint of his otherworldly rapier magnified by the incessant burning of the rapier he held in his other hand.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This dimension has been pilfered by me to the extent it can be.  It is time for me to move on.&quot;  Deluin nodded.  He had seen this coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am needed to battle gods and otherworldy monsters in other planes of existance.  It is my duty - I've taken a lot from this world, I need to give something back.  And i surmise there will be more loot to be had from gods than from the frogs and dogs of common Norrath.&quot;  Yarg said, as a breeze wafted his black sash in the breeze.  The plates on his legs seemed to shimmer with a dark power.. forged from pure shadow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand my old friend.  But you neglect to say why you have called me here, and time, is money.&quot;  Deluin quipped, with a glint in his eye that implied he was kidding and an edge in his voice that said he was not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always to the point you were, eh my friend?&quot; chortled the barbarian as he slapped the bastard elf on the shoulder, and Deluin staggered backward as Yarg's greater strength knocked him nearly over.  &quot;Time has come for me to pass the blade down to a younger rogue with ambition enough to control a group of rakes such as Raven is.  I'd like you to be that rogue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And my cut?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Upped, of course.  I hear the lost lands hold great riches..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you'll stop hearing these things, as there are gods to be slain, eh, old man?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yarg chuckled and then a serious look took his face over.  &quot;I ain't kidding around here, boy.  Your head ain't always cool and you best keep in line, or else I'll send some nasty bashers from Brotherhood of the Sword over to have words with you -- if I don't break ya in half first.  That's my work you'll be leading, keep that in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the Brotherhood took you on, eh?  How much did you pay them?  I assume thats where that sack of platinum I gave you other day went to, heh.&quot;  Deluin said, as he turned to face the door from which he entered.  Raising his head and closing his eyes, he understood the responsibility that had been passed forth from master thief to adept.  Taking a deep breath, he turned around..<br />
<br />
..and Yarg was gone.  A small slip of paper that sealed the guild leadership transfer was on the stool where Yarg had sat, stuck down with a dagger.  <br />
<br />
Deluin signed the agreement, glanced around the room, and tucked it into his belt.<br />
<br />
A lilt of breeze, and he was gone. Deluin Kaine<br />

I would have thought they would be lost without you, but somehow I doubt that with their new leader<br />
Now, I should not be posting here, there is more fame to be found in Norrath doing that which no other man would even dream<br />
Untill we all meet each other in Veeshans Peak eh Yarg?<br />
