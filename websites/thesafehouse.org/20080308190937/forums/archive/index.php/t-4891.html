Is it something like 1 BP for each realm level someone is?  So a R2L3 person drops 13BP?  So far it doesn't seem to be like a set percentage of RP, but I haven't a clue what determines how much they give. Dither Disgustipated<br />

Also I think it rounds down. So for 32 I got 3 bounty then when I got a solo 23 point kill the other night I got 2. This is what I have noticed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every full moon, the Mythic staff gathers in a secluded grove in Midgard (you know they love it there).  They draw a big pentagram on the ground and put large candleabras at the points.  Then they all stand in a circle around the pentagram, with Sandra at its center.<br />
<br />
They begin chanting and waving their arms about wildly, while Sandra holds her hands up toward the sky.  After 12 hours (which is why your appeals take so long to be addressed), bolts of magic shoot from Sandra's eyes, shooting across the realms and hitting all of the RvR people.  When the bolts hit, your bounty points magically appear.<br />
<br />
After this they all collapse and fall into a deep slumber for two dream-filled hours (those dreams are how they determine who gets the next fix--and NOBODY likes to dream of assassins).<br />
<br />
And that, my friends, is how you get your realm points.    Aurra Sing - 32 InfiltratorDracos DivinusAlbion, Igraine</div></div><hr />
