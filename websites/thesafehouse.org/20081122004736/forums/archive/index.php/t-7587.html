&lt;u&gt;Sounds authentic if you ask me.. too much detail given and thought out&lt;/u&gt;:<br />
<br />
&quot;Verant and Sony are please to announce the opening of the newest EverQuest server, Mallok Zek. This new server is a Player versus Player (PvP) server built around a Holy-War Deity based team system. The server will go on-line on Monday, June 4, 2001. <br />
<br />
A new PvP ruleset is being introduced for the Mallok Zek server. These rules apply only to the new PvP server, not to the existing Rallos Zek, Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek servers. The rules are as follows: <br />
<br />
1. NO LEVEL LIMIT FOR PVP - Players on the Mallok Zek server will be able to attack, and be attacked, by players of any level. <br />
<br />
2. EXP LOSS FOR PVP DEATH +/- 5 LEVELS - When a player is killed by another player that is within 5 levels, experience loss will occur at 1/2 the rate of a normal player versus environment (PvE) game death. No experience will be gained for PvP kills, due to the obvious potential for exploitation and abuse. There are other rewards for PvP kills. <br />
<br />
3. COIN PLUS ONE ITEM OR FACTION SYMBOL LOOT +/- 5 LEVELS - When the player who lands the killing blow in a PvP encounter on a victim that is within 5 levels, that player will have loot rights over the victim including all of the victims coin and the choice between EITHER one item from the victim OR a faction symbol from the victim's corpse. Faction symbols look like a coin, and can be turned in to special Holy-War NPC's for a team faction boost. Once a player's team faction reaches a certain point, that player is able to complete team-specific quests. <br />
<br />
4. RANKING/SCORING FOR PVP KILLS - Each time a player lands the killing blow on another player, a score will be registered in a special database. That database will be accessible in-game through use of the &quot;/rankings&quot; command. Likewise, each time a player is killed by another player, a negative score will be registered in the database. Use of the &quot;/rankings&quot; command will provide information regaring a specific players number of kills, the number of times that player has been killed, and the average level of that player's pvp opponents (both victories and losses). <br />
<br />
5. SCORING/RANKING FOR GUILDS - Like the &quot;/rankings&quot; command for individual players, a separate database will be kept for guilds. By use of the &quot;/guildrankings&quot; command, a player can check the total number of PvP losses and victories of any given guild. The database will also reflect the current ranking of any given guild. The guild rankings are determined by kill/death ratio. (For example, a guild whose members had scored 300 PvP victories and had suffered 150 PvP defeats would have a kill/death ratio of 2.0.) <br />
<br />
6. NO PVP RULES; NO GM INVOLVEMENT WITH PVP RELATED ISSUES - Players on the Mallok Zek server will &quot;play at their own risk&quot; when it comes to PvP issues. GM's and Guides will only respond to situations involving PvE matters (such as game bugs, corpse problems, etc). As far as PvP is concerned, the only rules are those created and enforced by the players themselves. (This includes &quot;training&quot; other players, intentionally causing experience loss, bind-spot camping, corpse camping, zone line camping, etc.) <br />
<br />
7. NO FACTION HITS FOR PVP - Because most NPC's do not have a deity variable, there will be no faction hits for PvP kills on the new server. <br />
<br />
8. NEW /CONSIDER SYSTEM - Because of the new rules specific to the Mallok Zek server, a new /consider system is utilized. Players will be able to /con other players as follows: &quot;Green&quot; means that the considered player is more than 5 levels lower than your level. &quot;Black/White&quot; means that the considered player is within 5 levels of your level. &quot;Red&quot; means that the player is more than 5 levels higher than your level. Considering players on your own deity team will result in the message that &quot;Your deity frowns upon your thoughts...&quot; <br />
<br />
9. DEATH SHROUD AFTER PVP DEATH - Once a player suffers a PvP death, that player will respawn at their bind point with a &quot;death shroud&quot;. Much like resurrection effects, this shroud makes the player invulnerable to further PvP attacks for up to 10 minutes. However, if the player attempts to cast any spell, or attacks another player, the shroud will dissapear. While under the death shroud effect, players may still be attacked by PvE creatures. <br />
<br />
10. CROSS-TEAMING - Special code has been written which will prevent &quot;cross-teaming&quot; on the new server. Members of opposing teams will not be able to hear each others communications, except through /tells. Members of opposing teams will not be able to cast beneficial spells on each other (except for summon corpse and resurrection spells), guild with each other or trade with each other. <br />
<br />
11. TEAMS - Due to the complexity of the Deity system and the various roleplay aspects of the game, the deity/class/race system has been slightly modified for the Mallok Zek server. During the character-creation process, various additional class choices have been added for certain races, and various additional deity choices have been added for most races. That list will not be published here, it will be accessible in-game in the character creation screens. Every effort was made to balance the 3 teams while preserving as much of the EverQuest roleplay background as possible. <br />
<br />
12. ONE CHARACTER PER ACCOUNT - Players on the new PvP server will be allowed only one character (on that server) per account.&quot;  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Karlek</div><div class="date">06-07-01, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well this material is *not* that much off-shot;<br />
<br />
except 'shroud of death' almost all has been already implemented on Sullon Zek, or? <br />
Even 5-lvl range is here, in difference to originally planned 4-lvl one.<br />
<br />
Which just shows us that xteaming grief guilds like (Prophets/12 Prophets) - Bodda is the founder - DO have backing of *some* Verant high officials up there.<br />
<br />
No wonder we get no hardcoded teams on VZ :( Edited by: Karlek  at: 6/7/01 5:10:21 am</div></div><hr />
