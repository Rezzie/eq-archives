The platform that the Scouts of Tunares home rested on was unable to comfortably house the dozen and a half rogues that occupied it for the night. So the rogues had taken up housing nearby. They gathered now though, in front of the Scouts guildhouse. Tired and weary, his troops emerged rested and curious as to the nites mission. Scree's troops had practiced in squads all day, preparing for the advance that would come in only an hours time. They had all been well supplied, Scree having opened his vaults for the funding of the guilds endeavor. All were ready but unknowing of his mission.<br />
    &quot;What exactly are we doing here Scree?&quot;<br />
    &quot;A training mission, I cannae say more or we risk much.&quot;<br />
    &quot;The only place I can think we would dare assault is Crushbone, IS that our target?&quot;<br />
    Scree grumbled loudly, hoping his obvious displeasure at the inquiry would cease further questions. &quot;Aye the orcs of Crushbone are one of our targets, but they are not all we hunt tonite.&quot; The rogues took the hint and left it at that. &quot;Prepare your things, we leave within the hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
     The time passed quickly then, with nearly fifteen of Scree's best and deadliest following their leader from the protection of the shadows. No noise alerted the orcish guards who protected the entrance to the deeper portions of Crushbone. This attack was to be a total surprise. They came upon their first obstacle, the entrance being brightly lit and surrounded by a half dozen orcs. Scree signaled for two pairs of rogues to break off to the left and right, each man drawing twin daggers of the most horrible of intended deaths. Behind Scree in the dark confines of the shadows of the many trees of Greater Faydark, sat Kayos and Sorroea. The two waited for Scree's signal and when it came strode forth into the plain sight of the orcish guards. Then, together, the two activated their masks of deception. The orcs furious at the intruders presence went charging down at the sight of the two female rogues. They hesitated of course when the halfling and half elf turned into dark elves. Scree had counted on this and almost as soon as they hesitated, four of the six orcs fell to the repeated backstabings of the rogues he had dispacted moments earlier.  Confused and shocked, the surviving orcs fell almost as quickly. Again no alarm was sounded and the forests of Greater Faydark were quiet.<br />
<br />
     Scree's fifteen rogues closed in on the castle, but not from the front doors. Instead Scree brought them up a slight hill that flattened into a plateau, parallel to the castle. They were able to monitor the orcs with relative safety. Scree didn't order any further attacks though. In fact, the young wood elf signalled for sentrys to be posted. Of the fifteen, six were ordered to the various outcroppings of the plateau. He then called to his remaining troops to gather round and revealed his plans for the nite. . .<br />
