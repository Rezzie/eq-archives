<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-25-02, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">last weekend we were gaming. The concept is basically the two other players were shipped off to this island to pacify it so the Baron could use it as a stopover point for trading ships ( they got into a bar brawl, accidentally kille d a few civil watch members). I was Shipwrecked when the ship transporting me ran into a storm and I washed ashore near where the other two were. <br />
<br />
The island that was supposed to be about a mile or so across that they were to pacify has turned out to be SEVERAL miles across. on it are a group of indigiouness dragon men (sounds suspiciously like the DM was playing in Kunark too much to me but hey whatever). The dragonmen seem ok but a little on the primitive side, they told us that the &quot;golden elves&quot; from the next archipelego have been capturing and enslaving them since time began.  <br />
<br />
Now I thought they might be trying to just take us in (DM rolls all bluff and sense motive rolls) so we would fight elves for them. The dragon men allow us to return to our camp on the other side of the Island and await for the ship that is supposed to drop supply for the other two so we can try and hop on board and hijack the ship to escape.<br />
<br />
While waiting (it's going to be about another 27 days so we are just fortifying our position now) we get payed a little visit by a pair of elves with a slightly golden shimmer to there skin. but here's the kicker. they flew in on a BLACK dragon. <br />
Of course we saw the blacks so we hid thinking maybe the dragonmen really WERE telling the truth and I just blew a roll.The elves spot my girlfriend's character and go invis and whisper to her that they want to help. an illusionary boat ( I assume) materializes at the docks and they tell her to board it. I figure it is actually a slaver ship being disguised so I tell her and she attacks them. it's myself (half-dragon monk, one of my first non rogue char's heh) my GF (elven deepwood sniper prestige class) and our friend (kobold sorcerer...DRUNKEN kobold sorcerer I should say.) <br />
<br />
The kobold starts laying spells onto the dragon while Janelle and I try to take out the elves. the dragon of course is fighting back but when we killed one of the elves the dragon suddenly got very confused as if waking from a stupor.<br />
Unfortunately there was already a fireball headed for it, and as soon as it gets hit it starts attacking again.<br />
<br />
We managed to take them al out, but suddenly we're not sure if the elves might not have been on the up and up and been mind controlling evil dragons to keep them from causing too much trouble.<br />
<br />
Now the next problem. two days later a HUGE landing party of these dragonmen are spotted by Janelle off on the horizon, they have a dragon turtle with them and are heading at full steam. I'm trying to decid if they are attacking or coming to find the missing elves that there scouts might have spotted when the kobold and sniper start shooting at them. it's WAY too late for negotiation so we end up in full attack and manage to finish them off ( at the cost of the druid npc, only healer we had hehe).<br />
<br />
now searching the bodies we notice these dragonmen are a slightly differetn color than the others. So now we don't know if they are aligned with the other dragonmen, the elves or a third contigent. We also aren't sure if the elves are evil slavers or the dragonmen are screwing with us. <br />
<br />
of course then I am still trying to figure out wether to thank janelle for quick thinking in attacking the elves and the dragonmen, or smack her for getting us into deeper trouble.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think? who's lying to us? Oh and the elves said they aren't slavers, but the whole dragon situation kind of puts that in bad light.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">07-25-02, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like all factions have convoluted motives. Food for thought, evil elves(evil aligned anyways) probably wouldn't need or bother to charm a black dragon. It could be that blacks are the only species on the island.<br />
Why attempt to decieve your GF though? Why not just subdue her and take her capitve? Maybe return to the original dragon man camp and get some more clear details about how the elves operate?<br />
<br />
Either way, you are in some poo poo. You've managed to fight and members of 2 of the 3 factions you know of so far. You'd better hope that the first set of dragon men are being honest(assuming you have a good party.....), because you are enemies of the other two now.<br />
<br />
I find that the value of a surprise attack is less than the value of staying on NPC's good sides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-25-02, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had just assumed the elves did things more subtly when they tried decieving her ( assuming they were)<br />
<br />
we're playing again tomorrow and I'm thinking we may need to go back to the first dragonmen to help them. but then of course they are the peopel the other two in our party were supposed to &quot;pacify&quot; so the baron could take the island. I'm hoping we'll be able to survive the month and get onto the ship to explain the situation to the baron. I don't think he would want a port in the middle of a war zone. but royals can be.. obstinant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one who can do some detecting of evil?</div></div><hr />

Yes. Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">snicker, nope the kobold understands common but refuses to admit it and I don't think he has detect evil, the sniper can't cast spells except for true strike once a day or something, and as a monkey I got no spells.<br />
<br />
also I was reminded last night that the second wave of dragonmen had a ring with an identicle crest aas the elves had. So I assume they are associated, but as slaves or allies I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Heartsong Steelsoul</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, perhaps a strategic retreat would be good...<br />
<br />
(and some spellcaster recruitment)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-26-02, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm kicking around the idea of starting a few levels into cleric so we can get a little healer support at least. it's not to far a leap to make for my monk to switch to cleric as they are both monostic orders. as for the retreat we would love to, but it's a set of islands FAR away from the main continents and ummm... no boat and no teleportation/shapeshifting to flying critter abilities hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Reinerfore</div><div class="date">07-27-02, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Build a boat ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-29-02, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">snicker thought about building a boat, but none of use have any shipbuilding or sailing skills heh and the DM will only allow one skill point increase per level if you have no one to teach something to you.<br />
<br />
Of course the kobold has been picking up necromancy books and we know have a zombie dragon turtle at our disposal. the smell would be bad but we could make it eventually heh.<br />
<br />
This weekend the first group of dragonmen asked us to investigate a barren area that was supposed to be cursed. when we went in we found out hte gold elves were actually phase shifted from an alternate reality  to escape that reality. unfortunately there had been an accident and the majority were killed in the transfer. the few remaining had to make there own way. that was several elven generations ago.<br />
<br />
We are now level 14 and QUICKLY leveling in the caverns that hold the elves former home so we'll be sticking around for a bit. Of course my half dragon monk recently got some dragon men converts and has them building a monastary and the kobold has an undead army, so if we decide to leve for some reason we're pretty sure we can get the ship that drops supplies  easily enough heh.<br />
<br />
BTW the deepwood sniper prestige class is downright scary. Janelle became one as a level 5 fighter, she's now a 5 fighter level 9 deepwood sniper, she crits with her longbow from 15-20 for 5X damage and has a shocking burst bow with something like 5 attacks a round.<br />
