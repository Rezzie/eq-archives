<br />
<br />
there's definately optimum ways to spend that energy<br />
<br />
<br />
rogues also have some combos that are stronger the more moves you string together in a row<br />
<br />
typically, if i'm soloing, i'll do this<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll start out at max range, and toss 2-3 daggers<br />
when mob is in melee range i'll hit it with the 4sec stun, strafe around backstab, then hit either eviscerate(finishing move), or slice and dice (20% self haste)<br />
(that's basically 1 full bar of energy, and 50% of the mobs health)<br />

<br />
Energy is a constantly replenishing resource.  It goes up 10 every second, roughly, no matter what you're doing.  Usually, I use about 250 energy per fight.<br />
<br />
-- Do you try to use it all because you regain it quickly, or is it something that should really be conserved strategically? <br />
<br />
It's all about timing and sequences.  For example, Backstab takes 65 energy, Sinister Strike (frontstab) takes 40, and Gouge (stun) takes 30.  If I sinister strike, then try to pull a gouge-backstab combo, I can't, because the stun on gouge is very short - roughly 3 seconds.  not enough time to regenerate the energy i used in the first attack.  However, if I gouge/backstab to start and then use sinister strike when I regain enough energy, I complete all 3 attacks.  You can burn down mobs by unleashing a flurry of high-energy attacks, but that draws aggro like mad in groups - thus, a bad idea.<br />
<br />
-- Are there any spells that help to regenerate it?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
-- Are there items that increase your energy potential?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
-- Do different classes or stats affect how much energy you have?<br />
<br />
No.  Everyone has 100 energy.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver (retired)<br />
  -- Arafein Soulstriker, 54 Champion Relic (deceased)<br />
  -- Arafax Kokorozan, 20 Monk Giantfriend (missing)<br />

  -- Formerly of The Rathe Server, now of Zebuxoruk<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rokktor</div><div class="date">04-27-04, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I blow my energy at least twice a fight like the other guy.  I'm only 11 so I haven't had a fight last longer than that.  Let's just say that if you stood there using only autoattack, it would be hard to kill an even level mob.  <br />
<br />
I used to do the sleep, strafe, BS.  But I got Eviscerate II and I've found that I'm better off standing in front, using that level 1 move to build at least two combo points, then firing either Eviscerate II or that self-haste buff.  Usually the damage moves make the kills go faster than haste though.<br />
<br />
Energy is micromanaged, and how you do it depends on what skills you have spent points on.  I was a bit strapped for skill points.  I accidentally spent a few early ones on stats.  Then I soaked some into leatherworking and skinning.  If I had to do it again, I'd save for skinning right away so I could've been skinning all my corpses since Level 1.  Getting skins to skill up with takes forever.</div></div><hr />
