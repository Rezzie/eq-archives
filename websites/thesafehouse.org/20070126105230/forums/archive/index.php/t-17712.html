<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">03-03-05, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the first time my friends and I fought the Emperor we really weren't paying too much attention to not harming the Princess.  None of us were working on the quest (so I thought) so my gf stuck her pet (hunter pet) on the princess to keep it off our priest.<br />
<br />
After the Emperor died, we learned that our Paladin actually WAS at that point in the quest, and he was able to finish it even though the Princess had been engaged.  Previously we were under the impression that in order to succesfully complete the quest, the Princess could not be harmed AT ALL.  This has lead us to conclude one of two things... which turns out to be the correct one will decide how we engage it next time.<br />
<br />
1) As the pet was the only thing to engage the Princess, it didn't count towards her being harmed by us.  No one else ever touched her, not even the hunter controlling the pet, leaving the quest completable.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2) The princess can be engaged and occupied by anyone NOT working on the quest - you are only invalidated from finishing it if YOU PERSONALLY engage/harm her in the course of the battle.<br />
<br />
Personally I favor option 2 - under any other circumstance I've ever witnessed, a hunter pet engaging a mob is exactly the same as the hunter itself engaging it.  <br />
<br />
When we go back my gf will be wanting to finish the quest too, and by the logic of #2 she won't want to put the pet on the Princess to keep her off our priest - instead we'll have the Paladin keep her occupied and everything should be fine.<br />
<br />
However, if anyone has compelling argument that #1 may be the correct explaination, I'm willing to consider the alternative course of action - have her put the pet on the Princess again.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

That's the first I've heard of that.  Most accounts have said if you damage her at all you won't be able to finish the quest.  ergo my 1 and 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">03-04-05, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in the end we did it the same way the second time - hunter pet on the princess.  No problems, she was able to complete too.</div></div><hr />
