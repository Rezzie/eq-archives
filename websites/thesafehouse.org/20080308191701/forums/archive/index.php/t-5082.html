How bad will this gimp my little one?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jiordin</div><div class="date">05-26-02, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes envenom is pretty critical to your success as a NS.  There are probably a few NS's out there that do ok with less envenom spec however Mythic has made it very clear that NS's are supposed to be the masters of poisons.  <br />
<br />
NS's are severaly gimped dmg-wise compared to the assasins in other realms (Post's are all over this board that go into great detail supporting this comment so I won't waste time backing it up).  That's not to say that you couldn't make it work, but you will definately be working at a disadvantage.</div></div><hr />
