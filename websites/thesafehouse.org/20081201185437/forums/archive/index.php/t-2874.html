<br />
Here is the HTML from your sig:<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;P&gt;&amp;lt;center&gt;&amp;lt;p align=center&gt;&amp;lt;font  face =&quot;Verdana,Arial&quot; size=&quot;3&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;<br />

&amp;lt;/font&gt;&amp;lt;/p&gt;&amp;lt;/center&gt;<br />
<br />
You are lacking tags.<br />
<br />
To get the first phrase, the image, and the ohter phrases on seperate lines, without a paragraph space, just add a <br />
 between them. Your tags are also disorded, and you have a &amp;lt;center&gt; and a &amp;lt;p align=center&gt;<br />
<br />
So it should look like this:<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;P&gt;&amp;lt;center&gt;&amp;lt;font  face =&quot;Verdana,Arial&quot; size=&quot;3&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;<br />

He comes back, sees 14+ replies.. but only us two actually replied.<br />

Is there a lot of interest in Arthurian legends, more specifically, Morgan le Fay, in Germany that you notice?<br />

I get a lot, and I mean A LOT of IMs and Email written in german on my Morgana le Fay SN on AOL. Most of the people are very nice, thank goodness for babelfish.<br />

<br />
Germans in general probably have a larger empathy towards the middle ages and the corresponding legends and myths. So i could expect that this is maybe one reason.<br />
<br />
There are some neo-celtic/tribal trends around, maybe even getting more common. Possible that celtic/tribal fans dig into everything that comes from Irland &amp;amp; United Kingdom, including myths and legends.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xyzzy Syzygy</div><div class="date">07-27-00, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, ok., now... uh...  is this still a post about HTML stuff, or has it been jacked and driven south of the border to be sold to a chop-shop?<br />
<br />
i WAS gonna post on the main lounge, but my questions probably belong more in this sector. i just figured not as many people would read it, but hey, halen is here, and mebbe thats all th help i need.<br />
<br />
a few questions about slapping images into one's ezboard postings:<br />
<br />
1. how do you attain a transparent background for your images? for example, if i want a sillouette of (say) a tree and i want the background to be whatever background the pic is on top of. (yellow or grey, in the case of the safehouse messages). that way, i dont wind up with a big rectangular background behing my pic, yet on top of the message color. (ok, mebbe im not explaining this very well...)<br />
<br />
2. what are the general accaptable dimensions for a &quot;photo&quot; (the little pic under yer name, to the left of the post)? the ezboard FAQ says 60x60, but most of the ones ive seen are bigger than that. also, im not sire, but does the entire &quot;photo&quot; column for the displayed page of postings get aligned according to the width of the widest photo?<br />
<br />
3. again, accaptable dimensions for a &quot;signature&quot; pic? ive seen some wachy-sized pics, and im assuming thats frowned upon. also, personally, i dont really care for particularly &quot;tall&quot; pics, as it means that much more scrolling to do (poor widdle ol me, eh?)<br />
<br />
4. this goes for both photo and signature pics. although the pixel dimensions can vary a lot, about what size should i keep the files under? i have 56k at home, and &gt;= T1 at work, so im not too sure how to guage the load times. what file size is considereed &quot;pushing it&quot; and what is &quot;downright rude&quot;?<br />
<br />
5. is it usually consideres &quot;ok&quot; to use animated gifs instead of jpgs for photos and signatures? id imagine as long as its kept to a low resolution and few number of frames, it shouldnt be a problem...<br />
<br />
6. ok, mebbe the most pertinent question i have (thus, saved for last). how do you do multiple posts with different pictures for your sig? i havent played around with it TOO much. but, do you hafta go into your ezboard settings and change the url for the filename each time?<br />
<br />
6b. once you post a message, and your sig has pic_A.jpg, and you change it so yer sig so in your next post, it has pic_B.jpg...  uh....<br />
<br />
i fergot where i was going with this.<br />
<br />
anyways, basically, how can you have so many different pics in your numerous postings.<br />
<br />
<br />
so, there ya go. i appreciate any enlightenment you have on these topics. im no supergeek, but i know a little about HTML, ive read the ezboard stuff, i have photoshop to edit pics, ive also made my own animated gifs, and i have a semi-stable server to host the pics on.<br />
<br />
thanks, in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xyzzy Syzygy</div><div class="date">07-27-00, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, so, im figuring its a &quot;use common sense&quot; kinda thing when it comes to dimensions or file-size. if its too big, i guess ill get feedback saying so.<br />
<br />
rec, im currently using photoshop (v4.0, i believe) to do editing. i didnt know if you set a background to a RGB value of 0,0,0 if that would make it transparent when viewed against the yellow or gray backgrounds of the safehouse posts. ill hafta experiment when i get home.<br />
<br />
also, im using some cheesy lil freeware program i got off tucows to take the multiple gif and turn them into a single animated gif. oh yeah, for the icon, is the only size you can have an icon be 10x10?<br />
<br />
thanks for the... uh.... short, yet direct answers. i guess ill hafta experiment with it a little to figure some stuff out. (but mainly, its the &quot;different pics on different posts&quot; question that remains in my brain...)<br />

<br />
i seem to remember some editor using 0,0,0 as the transparent color, but mebbe this was a long time ago. or maybe i was masking something, i dunno. ill set that layer to transparent in photoshop, though.<br />
<br />
ya, layers is your friend. (and once you figure out that you need to FLATTEN IMAGE before you can save it as anythign but a .psp file, theyre even MORE your friend)<br />
<br />
ok, you NEED to save it as a gif for the transparency thing to work. gotcha (im taking notes, if ya couldnt tell   )<br />
<br />
<br />
so, when you make a post, your ezboard profile is kinda cut n pasted onto the post, and it stays there. it's static code that doesnt change, even if your ezboard profiles DOES change, afterwards. it aint no fanCEE dynamic reference to your profile, which then tells it what url to find the pic. ok, gotcha.<br />
<br />
<br />
while im thinking of it, does ANYone use the &quot;voice message recorder&quot; thingie? actually,  i scroll down and see its not even available for this reply, so nevermind. mmKAY?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks for the info, rec. ill go home tonight and start workin on some purty pitchures. (heaven forbid i actually play EQ and try to break 20 someday in the next year or so...)<br />

You can &quot;save as copy&quot; or &quot;save for web&quot; and it will save the visible layers as if they were flattened.<br />
<br />
And yah, when you post - all ezboard does is grab that sig html and stick it on the bottom of the post.  It's static from then on.<br />

<br />
and besides, twinkin sucks and blah blah blah etc etc!!<br />
<br />
oh, i just dont have the energy to pull off being offended at twinking.<br />
<br />
not to veer this thread off on some twink tangent, but its kinda funny. people go on n on about how much they hate twinking, yet, i wonder how many people would ACTUALLY turn down good gear if they were offered it. im sure a few would, but, what: less than 10%?<br />
<br />
lemme know if you ever plan to play your troll or enchanter seriously, i wouldnt mind grouping with a rogue-savvy player. im only 19 right now, but i hope to start playing more oftener. (and if yer DE is in the market for joining a guild, lemme know, might be able to setcha up)<br />
<br />
sure, ill graciously accept any offers of donations of any kind. and if i cant use it for myself, i have a few RL friends who might be able to utilize th stuff. also, i could use it for prizes in a guild event im hoping to pull off sometime soon. (dunno how to include html links in ezboard posts yet, but...) www.access.digex.net/xyzz...event.html the guild board is www.access.digex.net/nation if yer interested.<br />
<br />
ok, i should get back to work. thanks for all the help! (present and potentially future)<br />

<br />
im in photoshop 4, and i have cut n pasted a headshot from a EQ screenshot (bitmap). ive gone around the edges of the head with a bright green, so now i have a head on a green background.<br />
<br />
is there a way to &quot;make this color transparent&quot;?<br />
<br />
or will i hafta cut n paste JUST the head onto a new background (which is set to transparent upon creation)?<br />
<br />
thanks for the help!<br />
<br />
<br />
btw, i also made a custom icon. although it is the standard 10x10 in dimensions, its 13k in size, at 16 frames. i was wonderingif this is acceptable by the average denizen of the safehouse (more specifically, the moderator, i guess...). thanks for the feedback!<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
edit: bah, although i can exactly surround the head part using the rope-grab tool (SHIFT-click for including and ALT-click for excluding), once i cut n pasted it onto a transparent background, it had the greenish (from the background) fuzzy edges. <br />
<br />
whew, nice run-on there, man.<br />
<br />
guess i still need to muck around with photoshop4 some more.<br />

Sounds a little too much like a char my bro played briefly.. a gnome, 3'2&quot;.. wearing a helm with a 3' spike on top. The icing on the cake: The spike had a little flag waving off the top, that said  6'3&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I know what you mean though, Verant pulled the plug on my server and now I am trapped in the frenzy room.  I've also been feeling a bit under the weather recently (hence the fork comment above).<br />

Hey Shadowcross, I forget what thread you wrote it in, but it looks like you had worse luck with the frenzy camp then me.  That is kind of comforting in an odd way, although I'm looking to beat your record at this pace  .<br />

Oh, that was at level 49 i think. I already had given up on getting a FBSS before i get a better Haste item.<br />

I am insanely stubborn and luckily so are the people that I group with, so it looks like we are going to camp that darn place until we get some sashes (we really need 3, but I think we will settle for 2).  Luckily, if one ever does drop I will only have to random against one other person who is a friend of mine (so if they win it I will be happy for them).  Someday it will be mine....oh yes, it will be mine  D&quot;&gt; <br />

<br />
As for the weekend, some of my guild folks are going to hit Guk on Saturday night for the Globe of Shadows for the Enshroudhment robe quest. I suppose we make take another crack at the Warden for a Troll Hide Belt, but the way that has been working, I'll see a FBSS first. We're all starting to think of JBoots as well, but that whole things seems to be quite the pain in the butt.<br />
<br />
And of course, I'll be on the lookout for a new &quot;big poker&quot;.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And your weekend plans Shadowcross?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, concerning the &quot;big poker&quot;.. come to Solusek Ro and we shall see what i can do for you.<br />
<br />
... i'm sure i can get one of the possible weapons you are looking for.  <br />
<br />
Well, still working hard to gain levels.<br />
Need.. to.. level.. to.. kill... Trakanon.. <br />
<br />
I'd guess i will spend this weekend in Sebilis and Charasis.<br />
If it turns out well, i might be the owner of a Bloodpoint and some more Mrylokar's part on Monday. <br />
<br />
Good luck on getting your Troll-hide and the globe for your necros. The globe was my first camp ever.. was fun, lot's of beer, and quite a hard thing to reach, too, as our group consisted of only 4-5 ppl level 30-37.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kirrae</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh my, bribery now. Ok, ok. I'll come visit Sol Ro. What times do you usually play?   <br />
<br />
Tell me about the Globe camp please? As of right now we have 6 people levels 30-34, and hopefully Rubin will pop by as well. There may be more, not sure yet.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the Bloodpoint and the Mrylokars! Wow, that sort of thing is way beyond even my dreams at this point.</div></div><hr />

Weekend: 11/12am-12pm CET, which is ~ 3/4am-4pm PDT<br />
<br />
That is the range i usually play at, but i'm not always on at these times.<br />
<br />
Just look up my ICQ, 25187052, if it is up and N/A, then chances are high that i'm playing.<br />
<br />
My alternate char right now is Valory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Globe camp: well, it's deep inside UGuk, quite doable if you got someone that can invis you so you don't have to fight the whole way back there. <br />
Our problem was that we had 3 necros, 1 rogue (me) and 1 cleric. So we couldn't get the cleric back to there without fighting through the whole dungeon.<br />
<br />
A balanced group with invis should be able to get to the spot without much trouble, esp. since the zone is right around the corner.<br />
<br />
Get a map and no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Halen</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the worst group in the world last night =)<br />
<br />
Lake of dull omen - grouped with shaman and enchanter. Should be good, right? Er. hrm.<br />
<br />
Shaman was tanking - ok, no worries, backstabs a plenty. Enchanter was casting, er, DD's. And breeze. Not much else. We died to a 'train' of 2 sarnaks and a tiger. Er, wtf? <br />
<br />
I GNID'd to 25, and was on my way back to my corpse wondering why the enchanter didn't, say, stun, or maybe mezz them. She was low on mana, but stun is a low mana spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;How come you didn't mezz&quot; said I.<br />
&quot;oh, I didn't have it memmed.&quot; said enchanter. <br />
<br />
Er.<br />
Enchanter sits down and memms mezz.<br />
<br />
&quot;how about stun&quot;<br />
<br />
Enchanter sits down and memms stun.<br />
<br />
I pull a sarnak. Enchanter zones - &quot;sorry&quot;, says the shaman, &quot;she doesn't really like sarnaks&quot;. ER? Her friend (a wizard I think) has joined the group. She joined, ran about a bit, and that's it. When enchanter eventually zoned back in, she revealed that her friend had &quot;gone to buy some cigarettes&quot;. <br />
<br />
I went to bed.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kirrae</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now to convert that to Central time...    I always get time zones confused.<br />
<br />
As long as everyone shows up, we have a good balanced group. Cleric, Druid, Necro, Wizzie, Monk, and Rogue (me). We've played this team a good bit lately and have done very well, I'm confident we can do most anything in our level range with little problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a cleric yesterday, that wanted to heal the whole group by casting Valor from his class kunark armor.<br />
<br />
200 heal with 10+ casting time.<br />
<br />
Mobs that hit doubles for up to 140 each.<br />
<br />
I was main tank, besides 2 pets, because we didnt get a warrior.<br />
Started healing all of us when we were down to about 20%, even casters.<br />
Then he started telling me to get behind the mobs so that i could backstab, because that would be what i was supposed to do.<br />
At that time most of the group had constant lag attacks with about 50-80% PL. I saw a few attacks, then the pic froze for about 5-10 secs, the i saw a few attacks again.<br />
<br />
Still don't know why nobody died. Guess we were just lucky.<br />
At that point our group leader disbanded him and we went back to zone to look for another cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kirrae</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yipes! That is a sad group Halen. A good enchanter is a blessing, a bad enchanter is a pain in the butt.  <br />
<br />
Maybe you need to come to Sol Ro too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kirrae, try to get the group back to the campspot with invis from the wizzie. Otherwise you might have to fight up to 3-5 mobs in the blue-yellow range at level 30.<br />
<br />
Without an enchanter that might get hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Halen</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot to mention that the shaman spent half a bar of mana healing the sarnak, wondering why his heal wasn't working =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kirrae</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've all been in Guk before, and the wizzie is very good about invis, so that shouldn't be a problem, unless it drops on someone unexpectedly. We'll manage it somehow, have to get that globe! Unfortunately there are not many enchanters in our guild, we'll have to work on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Halen, that really sucks.. esp. loosing a level because of so stupid ppl.<br />
<br />
That's the thing i like most about being high-level and in a often called &quot;high-power-guild&quot;.<br />
<br />
People know what their job is.<br />
People don't try to tell you what your job is.<br />
People react faster, and react right.<br />
<br />
Well, you need to be like that, too. Else you will die in a few seconds. Any mistake at that level might prove letal to the whole group.<br />
<br />
I had groups where we held disco in Sebilis for 6-8 hours, all the time being just one fault away from total whipe-out.<br />
All the casters were LOM or OOM all the time, we barely could keep up with the respawn.<br />
<br />
Well, going to dinner now.. be back in about 20-30 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Halen</div><div class="date">08-04-00, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't really mind, it was hilarious.

<br />
Anyhow, i was in a hurry before, as we wanted to leave..<br />
<br />
First of all, it's lunch, not dinner. /bonk<br />
<br />
And to conclude what i told you:<br />
<br />
Although we were that close to death, we all had a great time. Not that usual camp, kill mobs, wait, kill mob.<br />
It was thrilling, for hours. Will be survive the next pop? Or will be all die?<br />
<br />
That's what i like at EQ, esp. at high levels.</div></div><hr />
