<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zincarla Khazidhea</div><div class="date">06-22-07, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are planning to do these quests, or have already started, which faction did you align with? For those new to this, its a series of 45+ armor quests in Southwest Thestra. There are 3 factions with 3 different sets of archetype specific armor. The gorgalok quests offer armor with primarily offensive stats, the Ichtahkta offer quests with primarily defensive stats, and the Flordiel offer armor with balanced stats. Below are the stats for the base versions of the armor. Every set can be upgraded through more farming and crafting to yield Heroic versions, where the base pieces are level 50 rare.<br />
<br />
Gorg: 1485 AC, 153 Str, 0 Con, 126 Dex, 490 HP, 103 Dmg, 161 Crit Chance, 184 Acc, 62 Evasion <br />
<br />
Ichi: 1593 AC, 101 Str, 35 Con, 87 Dex, 1039 HP, 0 Dmg, 0 Crit Chance, 240 Acc, 214 Evasion <br />
<br />
Flor: 1463 AC, 84 Str, 91 Con, 84 Dex, 992 HP, 92 Dmg, 84 Crit Chance, 229 Acc, 37 Evasion <br />
<br />
MoP: 1107 AC, 110 Str, 5 Con, 86 Dex, 535 HP, 0 Dmg, 51 Crit Chance, 0 Acc, 17 Evasion <br />
<br />
The caveats are that the Ichi numbers are based off the old helm, and the Flor numbers are based off the old helm and the old gloves. By that I mean that Curse still only has the uncommon versions in its database rather than the rare versions. So expect the Ichi numbers to rise just a little bit for certain attributes.<br />
<br />
I know that typically a rogue should shoot for offensive stats, but the defensive Ichi armor is looking pretty enticing to me. True, I would lose Str, Dex, + Dmg, and Crit chance, but I gain a fair amount of Melee Accuracy and Melee Evasion, plus a lot of AC, and 7-800ish HP. From my experience, it seems like Accuracy and Evasion gear is much rarer than str/dex/crit gear, so it would be easy to narrow that gap a bit through jewelery and peripheral slots. Conversely, it would not be easy to make up the difference in Accuracy and Evasion if you did the Gorg armor quests.<br />
<br />
So theoretically speaking, through doing the Ichi quests, you could build a rogue with slightly less than the best dps, but significantly more survivability and viability against 50+ mobs (thanks to the accuracy).<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
P.S. Plus, since most healers and tanks choose Ichi armor, its probably easier to find a regular group doing that content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythdarr</div><div class="date">06-22-07, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went for Gorg Offensive.<br />
<br />
When I'm adventuring I'm in a group, stealthed and backstabbing.<br />
<br />
I chose pure offense since I do not solo, I do not get hit, and being a Kojani Human I already got some good defense with my racial and stat allocation.<br />
<br />
Some sets will be easier to complete (Heroic Upgrade) than the Gorg which will require some hides that are practically non-existent.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is a small walkthrough for Hegnerian, if anyone has some info please pm me or post it here =)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I think a lot of the people doing Heg are holding the strategy pretty close to the vest right now. On Florendyl, there appears to be sort of a pissing contest between the two most hardcore guilds. One is accusing the other of &quot;exploiting&quot; to get to Hegnerian because they supposedly can't figure out how to get to him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and the upgraded Ichi armor by far has the coolest name! I'll take Shadowmantis over Flare Totem any day of the week :)<br />
<br />
I just think its easier to compensate for the lack of str/dex/crit than it is for the lack of the AC/HP/Accuracy/Evasion.<br />
<br />
I dont know exactly how the modifiers work, but that extra Accuracy could make a big difference when hunting in the end game places like Stiirhad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythdarr</div><div class="date">06-22-07, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont know about accuracy it seems to be bugged.<br />
<br />
I wear 5 thestran Jewelry items of mastery (+weapon skill which is +accuracy then you add continental effect)  and I have some of my gorg armor with +accuracy rating.<br />
<br />
And guess what... I still miss my openers way too often, that is happening on monsters and players lower level than me. It really hurts when you are banking on that 3 second stun of ravage.  I wonder just how much % to hit you need to get 100% success.  I believe we start at 95%... I wonder what my actual % is... 101+% maybe more and yet it MISSES.<br />
<br />
But have to agree that if you get hit a lot and tank some on your rogue the Gorg set is not for you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zincarla Khazidhea</div><div class="date">06-28-07, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally hit 45 last night so I can start these questlines. Here are the stats for the upgraded Gorg (Flare Totem) and Ichi (Shadowmantis) armor:<br />
<br />
Gorg: 1620 AC, 161 Str, 0 Con,  143 Dex, 625 HP, +136 Dmg, +148 Crit, 154 Acc, 66 Evasion<br />
<br />
Ichi: 1780 AC, 113 Str, 43 Con, 94 Dex, 1163 HP, 0 Dmg, +37 Crit, 214 Acc, 273 Evasion<br />
<br />
<br />
So if I go with Ichtahkta armor, I GAIN 160AC, 43 Con, 538 HP, 60 Acc, 207 Evasion and LOSE 48 Str, 49 Dex, 136 Dmg, 111 Crit Chance.<br />
<br />
Any more opinions? Any ideas how that Str, dex, dmg, and crit chance translate into real world game mechanics? Will it significantly change my damage or only marginally. I've never been one to parse, so I don't know how great an effect they have.<br />
<br />
Am I gimping myself if go defensive for the AC, HP, Acc, and Evasion? I play in a smallish guild that is not interested in being the very first to raid. We just do all the group content and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythdarr</div><div class="date">08-10-07, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went pure offense and I sure don't regret it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zincarla Khazidhea</div><div class="date">08-23-07, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally got the upgrade materials last night for the Shadowmantis armor, so I'm completely decked out in that, minus using the Gloves of Hatred over the Shadowmantis gloves.<br />
<br />
I'll post up a screenshot either today or tomorrow of the stats, but overall Im quite happy with it. Its nice having the additional 6% evasion for when the **** hits the fan. I definitely lost out on a bit of damage, str/dex, and crit chance, but the additional ac, hp, and evasion is noticable.<br />
<br />
Plus, the BP proc is awesome. Whenever I activate it, it goes off constantly, and the various effects stack. Practically every swing lands one of the three procs, and I usually have 2 active at once.<br />
<br />
Overal looks are pretty good. The legs and the boots don't match of course, but the bp, arms, bracers, shoulders are all a dull green and grey, reminiscent of camouflage.</div></div><hr />
