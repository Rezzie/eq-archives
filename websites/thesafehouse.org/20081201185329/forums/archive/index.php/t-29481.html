<br />
we are pleased to announce that we will have our first open recruitment phase after release. We will be offering some spots for promising applicants and allow a 4 week period for applications. Evaluations of the applications will be done as fast as possible, at the latest a few days after the application period has ended and trial period will be given to the ones accepted in. <br />
<br />
..about us: <br />
Our guild currently has around 100 members, including alternative characters, between 60 and 70 individuals are member of our guild. We offer a very dedicated team of crafters to cover any and all areas of crafting and we are capable of producing anything in the very best quality currently available on our server. On the adventuring side we have a group of approx. 20 people in their mid 40s, with some 50s, and another 20 people between 27 and 39. We are planning to have one raidforce ready with the faster raiding focused guilds on the server and another one coming after that. However, we are not a hardcore guild, we are a very community centric guild. Our members contribute to the guild in many ways and we tend to be very organized. We have various activities to offer, harvesting events as well as guild meetings in our little town. The guild currently owns around 25 Houseplots with a few tier 3 houses built on them to test the mechanics. Currently we are looking into guild housing and preparing a few other projects on the way to our little town. <br />
<br />
..your profile as an applicant: <br />
If you would like to apply for membership there are a few things you should defnitely bring with you. Our members are contributing to the guild in many ways as part of their membership. We have a constitution &quot;The Dogma&quot; (in our knowledgebase you can find it under guild documents) and we stick to it as good as we can. We have a tax system, if it is needed our members spend 75% of their money on guild taxes. Furthermore our crafters craft items for the guild, to sell or to use, whatever serves the guild best. As a side note let me say that none of our crafters or adventurers have to suffer in terms of equipment. We just share everything in an organized fashion so everything gets the best out of it in the long run. If you are not ready to feel happy in such an environment, do not bother applying. We also expect participation from our members, we expect people to be active on our forums and really post their impressions, opinions and ideas there. We also expect people to step up if an administrative task in the guild has to be done or a position within the guild council or high council has to be filled. Everyone participates, that is what makes our guild successful. <br />
<br />
..our needs as a guild: <br />
<br />
Over the next two weeks we will offer around ten spots for trial membership with our guild, the trial is one month. The following is a desirability list for our guild when it comes to classes we need. We will accept applications from people who meet the level requirements for their class. The priority rating tells you how much we would like to guild a &quot;perfect fit&quot; of class X, it is either MEDIUM or HIGH; and the number tells you how many of those classes we could currently guild w/o unbalancing our roster. <br />
<br />
Crafting <br />
HIGH: Leatherworker lvl 25plus and dedicated <br />
HIGH: Carpenter lvl 25plus and dedicated <br />
<br />
all others: MEDIUM <br />
<br />
Adventuring <br />
<br />
We are open for applications from all classes in different level ranges. We could use around 10 more people between level 25 and 40 and another 10 more 40 plus. This is a rough priority listing: <br />
<br />
Bard | Very High <br />
Cleric | Medium <br />
Disciple | High <br />
Dreadknight | Low <br />
Druid | Medium <br />
Monk | Medium <br />
Necromancer | Medium <br />
Psionicist | High <br />
Rogue | Medium <br />
Sorcerer | Medium <br />
Warrior | Medium <br />
<br />
classes not listed are low priority. <br />
<br />
Now that you know what we are looking for you can feel free to apply. Make sure you read all the information in the recruitment section of our boards before you do that, tho, or your application may be declined due to lack of information. <br />
<br />
..the process: <br />
The process is roughly that you post your COMPLETE application AFTER reading all information available in our knowledge base and on our boards about our guild. You then talk to the members on the recruitment topic you posted and answer their questions. Depending on when you post your application you will be guilded sometime or told of the denial of your application, at the latest you will know a few days after the 4 weeks recruitment period is over. <br />
<br />
You should try to talk to as many members ingame as possible, get to know them, group with them and be very active on our boards all the way from application post through your trial period. We need active people  <br />
