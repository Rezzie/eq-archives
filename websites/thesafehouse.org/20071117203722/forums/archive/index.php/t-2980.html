The lands south of the Sea of fallen stars are a good place to look, theres lots of mercenary activity and such.  Also the major dwarven population is in the southern areas also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kordesh</div><div class="date">10-04-02, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just need a violent area, with dwarves, that has some type of history. I just need a name. I can't find this information online. google is being a wench.</div></div><hr />

Bren Kazun: A massive dwarven city, decimated by goblin and kobold forces many years ago. The dwarves occupy the city aboveground, and the kobolds/goblins have the lower levels and mines. Never-ending siege, and you can have relief forces for either of the groups coming in from outside the city. Maybe both, having groups with supplies clash in the wilderness. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kordesh</div><div class="date">10-04-02, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm. What would be more belivable. Orcs attacking a mine and killing everyone or goblins?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">10-04-02, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would think it'd be more original to say a dwarven mining exploration team broke through into holy burial ground of a Fire Giant clan, and the whole dwarven city was wiped out by angry fire giants.  Don't want to sound too much like LOTR after all (which appeared to have both goblins and orcs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tabbran</div><div class="date">10-04-02, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neither unless there were a majillion of them, or bolstered by something else, like drow or mind flayers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Frostdagger</div><div class="date">10-08-02, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm orcs under the direction of Duergar slavemasters, attacking the dwarven stronghold in order for the Duergar to stripmine the dwarven mines and take thier phat l00t back to thier underdark lairs?<br />
<br />
Or better yet, the dwarves have broken into a rather rich vein of ore, which unbeknownst to them until it was too late, was controlled by either Duergar, Svirfneblin or Drow. Maybe the drow were using slave miners in the area to harvest metals for thier weaponry and armor. Now they want the ore/gems in the dwarven mines above as well.<br />
