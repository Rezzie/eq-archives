<br />
Basically, all PC's are rogues to some degree or other, set in a city where a centralised rogues guild was smashed some years previously, with crimelords trying to fill that power vacuum.  All PC's start at level 3, and very poor.<br />
<br />
My character I created as a human fighter / rogue hybrid, the reasoning being that he came to the city from a village some miles away where he was trained as a fighter by his father, who had been an adventurer in his time.  His father gave him his sword and a few other oddments (none magical, not even superior, just has some meaning to him) and he went to find his fortune as an adventurer or a mercenary.<br />
<br />
However, the reality turned out to be a lot harsher, and he had to resort to petty thievery just to be able to be eat.  However, he managed to keep the bequeathed gear and store it carefully, in case it turns out that he's able to kick-start his career.<br />
<br />
Should be a lot of fun! <br />
