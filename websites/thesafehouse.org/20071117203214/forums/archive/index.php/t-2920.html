<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">03-30-02, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">played it a few times. good system, just that most of us were never really much into the western setting. of the two players that were, they only liked real westerns, not all the added magic and such.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">03-30-02, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I did play Deadlands for a bit. Played a 14 year old Huckster with an older sister that was an &quot;entertainer&quot; that he ended up protecting a lot. I kinda got tired of the game because one of the other players ended up playing an undead, I can't remember the name of them. Reckoned, or something. lol<br />
<br />
My Huckster got pretty powerful before I left the campaign. He had an artifact, his grandfather's cavelry sword and pistol, got some good combat bonuses and a lot of luck-based stuff from it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd say the system was fun, but got tiring at times, especially when you didn't play a huge role in the game.</div></div><hr />

It plays more like the Gunslinger books by Stephen King, but less gritty. I love the game, I think its the best skill set, &amp;amp; combat system I have seen.</div></div><hr />
