<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CogginsEQ</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, so seeing all my buds have fun, and some old friends from Erolissi Marr server having fun in EQ2, I have decided to make the purchase.<br />
<br />
My problem comes in...that my comp is going the way of the dinosaur.  I was wondering what kind of setups people are running EQ2 on?<br />
<br />
I am running a P4 1.5 ghz processor, 640 MB RAM, GeForce 4 ti4200 card.  Cable internet as well.<br />
<br />
Now, I have heard varying things on how well this setup will work.  I know the card should be ok, its the processor and RAM im worried about.  I will be upgrading my comp this winter, but as I am not going to soon, I was hoping someone could tell me if they have a system near what I am running.  And if so, how well does it run?<br />
<br />
I would rather not make the purchase and then be frustrated by not being able to play decently.    :angry <br />
<br />
Also, many apologies to the mods, as maybe this post deserves to be in Tech Help.  I put it here cause I figured I wanted an EQ2 players response, so move if needs be.   Thanks in advance guys.   :)</div></div><hr />

Not a shamless plug, it's just your machine isn't that far removed from mine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coyoteblack</div><div class="date">11-24-04, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your processor is fine. Most people who can play the game without lag say you NEED 1k ram. I only have 512 and I lag like a mo fo in cities zoneing is always a chore. but you shuld be able to play  it most the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgie</div><div class="date">11-25-04, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much ram do you have on your video card? VRam is extremely important in EQ2. Textures use up a lot of memory, and as mentioned, ram is important as well.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking you can certainly play, but just remember to turn off/down almost all the options in the settings. Low textures, no shadows, low spell effects, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CogginsEQ</div><div class="date">11-25-04, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thats sort of a problem.  As for some reason I cant find how much Vram I have on my card.  When I check under my settings for display, it just says &quot;GeForce 4 ti 4200 w/ AGP 8x&quot;.  I thought it would mention how much ram the card has, but it didnt.<br />
<br />
I then went to the GeForce site, and looked for my card and found it, but it only mentioned it with a 128, I thought it came in different options with lower RAM, but I couldnt find it mentioned.<br />
<br />
Again, my computer illiteracy might be just showing, any more help would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />
