<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">09-05-03, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm building a high level module for the Neverwinter Nights game, it'll be set around Neverwinter, will need some help with the story from someone who is knowledgeable about the governments of the region, Red Wizards of Thay, the Silver Marches, the Uthgardt clans, and the dragons, giants, and other notable game in the region.  Just wanted someone I could keep on AIM to be able to ask questions to and bounce ideas off of.  I have some good ideas and I think this will be a great module if I can do it all.</div></div><hr />

The one put out by WotC. Not the novels.<br />
Although the novels would probably have alot of stuff too...</div></div><hr />

You know, to say &quot;So the Red Tiger clan is being attacked by high level Duergans&quot; and to hear &quot;No, the Duergan would be attacking so and so.&quot;</div></div><hr />
