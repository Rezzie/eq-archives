So it would seem the latest patch went up live without any patch notes. Let me be the first to apologize for that. It was definitely not intentional. Statesman brought this to my attention this morning, and asked me to fill everyone in on what changed. So I am working on getting together a list of everything that went out this morning. I only work with powers myself, so I am bit fuzzy on other fixes or changes that went out, but I will be sure to get that info to you as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Since I started writing this, I was informed that NCSoft has posted a complete list of Patch notes HERE<br />
<br />
In any event, let me post the powers changes here, along with a few things that are on the way:<br />
<br />
Current Power Updates:<br />
*Increased movement speed of Storm Summoning/Tornado.<br />
*Decreased Recharge Time and Duration of Earth Control/Animate Stone – To compensate for its slow travel speed, it expires faster, but you can cast it faster. So you can keep it with you and not wait for it to catch up to you.<br />
*Update text on Earth Control to reflect its Debuff to Defense abilities.<br />
*Fix Short Help (Tool Tips) for Blaster/Devices.<br />
*Ice Armor/Wet Ice now takes Res Damage Enhancements.<br />
*Increased Accuracy of Auto Turret.<br />
*Arctic Air can now be used with stealth powers.<br />
*Slightly modified Ice Control/Arctic Air. It now randomly confuses and fears affected foes: &quot;While this power is active, you are surrounded in a fog of Arctic Air that dramatically slows the attack and movement speed of nearby foes. The chill of Arctic Air is so bitter that most foes are forced to flee, albeit very slowly, from the immediate area. Those that do not flee from the cold may attack their own allies, as the fog from the Arctic Air is thick and can cause much confusion.&quot;<br />
*Increase Endurance cost of Telekinesis.<br />
*Telekinesis will not longer work on bosses, arch villains or giant monsters.<br />
*Increase Endurance cost of Force bubble.<br />
*Fixed Seismic Smash – it was hardly doing any damage and its Stun Duration was too short.<br />
*Controller/Fire Control/Fire Imps: Reduced number if Fire Imps that are summoned by 1 (it is now 2-5).<br />
*Changed Gravity Control/Fold Space to Singularity (and moved it to the end as the last power in the set): &quot;You can create a very powerful Gravitational Singularity. The Singularity will engage your foes, assaulting them with various gravity powers. Any foes that attempt to approach the Singularity will be violently hurls away. The Singularity cannot be healed, but is highly resistant to all forms of damage and nearly impervious to Controlling type powers.&quot;<br />
*Super Speed no longer buffs defense and debuffs ACC, but added a rudimentary stealth ability to decrease the number of villains triggered while traveling.<br />
*Increase Duration on Mesmerize, Mass Hypnotize and Salt Crystals.<br />
*Increased Accuracy on for Mass Hypnotize and Salt Crystals (more targets in the AoE will be affected).<br />
*Dark Miasma/Darkest Night now also debuffs the targets Accuracy<br />
*Update Description text for Claws/Slash.<br />
*Set all Scrapper and Tanker Dull Pain powers (and Earths Embrace) to cost 15 Endurance.<br />
*Reduced Smashing, lethal and fire defense of Wet Ice. It was too similar to (and thus better than) Frozen armor.<br />
*Empathy/Resurrect can no longer take Heal Enhancements - It doesn't need them since it heals for 100% anyway, so these were wasted).<br />
*Slightly increased Combustion Damage.<br />
*Fixed the Endurance cost of Hack and Slash (for both Katana and Broadsword). END costs were reversed.<br />
*Increased the recharge time of Hasten and Accelerate Metabolism.<br />
*Updated Fly description Text (power has not changed).<br />
<br />
Here is a list of power changes that are on the way:<br />
*Confused villains will no longer eat up your XP. That is, if you Confuse a villain, and he damages another foe, you will still get MOST of the XP if you directly deal damage to the foe the Confused villain is attacking (the same applies to an ally if the ally attacks the villain that is being attacked by the Confused foe). I you do not do any damage to the foe, and the foe is completely defeated by a Confused villain, then no one gets the XP.<br />
*Summoned Pets from confused foes (like Fire Imps, Quicksand), will now also be Confused.<br />
*Confused Embalmed Cadavers will damage your foes.<br />
*Storm Summoning/Thunder Clap now accepts Accuracy Enhancements.<br />
*Increased the Accuracy of Storm Summoning/Thunder Clap. It now can affect more targets.<br />
*Fixed text message for Broadsword and Katana Whirling Sword. Added message that it debuffs targets defense. Power is unchanged, only the message was updated.<br />
*Fixed Pets traveling slower at higher levels.<br />
*Fear: Afraid Villains will no longer attack you unless attacked first.<br />
*Sprint will no longer cause your Jump Height to be lower. [/url]</div></div><hr />
