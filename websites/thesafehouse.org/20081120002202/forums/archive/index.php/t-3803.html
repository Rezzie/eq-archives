Some months ago searching web i found a godly map with all the spawn and traps on it. I've found also the thread here with that link...or better i suppose it was &quot;that map&quot; since now it's a dead link. Anyone has it a could post it here or link me where to find it?

title- VT maps<br />
<br />
I will email them to you, I am unaware of any site beyond a guildmates (and i dont want to suck his bandwidth) that still has them.<br />
<br />
1st floor map is very good, its just missing a bit of info on key mobs and port ups, 2nd floor is almost completely unlabeled and is a bit less pretty, but it still shows all mobs, traps, etc.<br />
