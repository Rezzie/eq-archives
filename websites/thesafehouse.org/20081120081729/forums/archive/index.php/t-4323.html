<br />
I guess I should have learned from EQ that HP &gt; All, but I'm hoping a good agi/stam balanced rogue will be effective.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I trust the people here at the Safehouse much more for an honest opinion than I do some random guy on the WoW boards, so gimme your take on the situation if you will.<br />

<br />
Agi has a direct and visible effect on your damage, but the return is much smaller than that of the effect sta has on your HPs.<br />
<br />
2 agi = +1 damage on weapon attacks.<br />
1 sta = 16 hps for a rogue.<br />
<br />
Very, very easy math.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver (retired)<br />

<br />
Also, would you lean towards a super stamina rogue or a balance of agi/stam with their current implementation? Lurik Crim`Tal<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">04-14-04, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new patch changes everything.<br />
<br />
From the 4/14/04 patch notes:<br />
<br />
&quot;Combat Changes:<br />
<br />
Characters have a new combat stat called &quot;Attack Power.&quot; Attack Power helps determine melee damage dealt. The new Attack Power value is displayed in your character sheet as Power. This value is based on class, level and ability scores. Most classes use strength, but rogues and hunters use a combination of strength and agility. The main purpose of Attack Power is to provide a more consistent effect from buffs, regardless of weapon speed. Slow weapons will receive a larger bonus from your Attack Power than faster weapons which will ultimately balance slow and fast weapons. It is important to note that most attack bonuses in the game now add to your Attack Power.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Also from the patch regarding Rogues specifically:<br />
<br />
&quot;Dodge will work more frequently than before.&quot;<br />
<br />
On a side note, if it has not been changed, I agree that stamina is still nicer than agility.<br />
