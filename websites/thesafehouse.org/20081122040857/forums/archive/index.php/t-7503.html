<br />
I was pritty young, level 19 I think and it while we outnumbered the other guild but they had the levels.  We had about 15 people ganging up on a 33 warrior while(I got him really pissed with my hide sneak backstabs for 40  )  Well I square off against a pair of casters next, druid and enchanter.  I catch the druid medding and send her running off(into the rest of my guild  ) and am left with an enchanter.  He keeps trying to cast on me but with the speed of my attack I wasn't haveing any off it.  He wasn't getting of any spells but his pet was tearing me up and he thought he could out last me.  Well I'm at 2 bubbles and him only 1 when he starts trying to run, down to a half a bubble at the zone myself only a bubble of hp he zones.  Here is the good part, I had been fighting in dark elf form and when I came out of the zone he didn't notice that these furry feet belonged to the same guy who was beating his ass.  I walked right past him lined up a nice backstab and finished him  in one shot    That was fun</div></div><hr />

Even with a worse ratio, I like to have fast weapons on Rallos for that reason, quick interrupts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Frankly</div><div class="date">05-15-01, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll tell my very favorite PvP story.<br />
<br />
This is an old one, back in the days when Vallon was item-loot and you still lost experience for DoTs and falls.  My best friend at the time was a Gnome rogue, and she ran up to do some banking in Kelethin.  But there were a bunch of elves camping the bank, and they rooted her, blinded her, and started blasting her.  She just /e taps her foot.  When the blindness broke she started bagging her stuff, but her health bar was dropping too fast to get all her banded in a sack.  So as soon as the root broke she ran out the door and off the platform.<br />
<br />
The bank in Kelethin is high...third level.  She hit the ground and died, losing experience, but she was young and a fraction of experience was worth less to her than a nice piece of banded.<br />
<br />
Then the server crashed.  When she gets back on an hour later, she's returned to her last save point, which in this case was in MID-AIR, in the MIDDLE OF HER FALL.  So the server thinks she only falls half-way, and her safe-fall is good enough for that.  She hits the ground and runs off!  No death, no experience loss.<br />
<br />
I tell you, she was full of herself for a month.<br />
<br />
I have some pretty exciting PK stories in Kelethin myself, when I was learning my fletching.  My little Gnome got to be expert at jumping from one level down to another...knew all the places to do that.  And I was a warrior, not a rogue, so I always hit with a crunch.  I really wanted to get away, too, because I'd be running from the bank to the fletching vendor with lots of cash.  It's astonishing that not one single elf ever followed me when I jumped between levels.  I guess elves running around that city are just never in enough fear for their lives to do that.  <br />
<br />
Ye gads, I could go on all day =)</div></div><hr />

Oh man, that is fun.  Everyonce in a while, you'll get somone who actually knows this kind of stuff, and its just a blast chasing them from platform, to platform.  Kelethin is a great place for PvP on teams servers.  You really gotta be on your toes there.<br />
<br />
I got hundreds of stories, but since we're on the subject, I'll just tell you this one.  You gotta love those casters that think they're safe when they levitate away from me off the top of Kelethin.  I just love to watch them go SPLAT after I hit my pumice on the    What's even nicer, is when they don't die from the fall, I can just jump down after them, and only take about 100 dmg, and finish them with one backstab.

Now that the sanctuary levels are in, you don't really need it.  Especially on rallos, where people just get to amiable faction and slaughter people wherever they please.  I've lost many a battle in kelethin due to the faction thing. 											Cylant Butdeadly<br />
