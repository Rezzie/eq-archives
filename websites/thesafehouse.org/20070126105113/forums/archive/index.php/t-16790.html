<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slymm</div><div class="date">01-26-05, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">did it last night with myself, (48 rog), 54 war, 53 priest, 48 mage, 49 druid.<br />
<br />
its important to know exactly how the hakkar fight works (its not just walk in and kill him), but other than that, its just a lot of mobs fairly back to back to back.<br />
<br />
id recommend a high 40s to low 50's group, witha  half decent tank, and a backup healer (as you will need a fair bit of healing.<br />
<br />
this group was however unable to take out the prophet (holy christ he's a bastard). namely because myself and the mage were too low to do much dmg to him (he's 54+, hard to land much on 6 lvls above you).<br />
<br />
picked up might of hakkar and lifeforce dirk last night, im so twinked.<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">01-31-05, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few tips.<br />
<br />
When the mobs start coming, try and pull them to one of the four corners.  Many of the snakes won't agro if your on other side of room from them, so if you can occupy them, the casters can drink, or low on health melees can eat.  <br />
<br />
As far as the prophet, take out his buddy first, he mezzes.  Have the tank hold the prophet, then all else drop Ogrom.<br />
<br />
Now if you want a fun fight, Erankus the dragon in there is even harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lindianae</div><div class="date">03-09-05, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That dragon is really tough. We did it the other night with 60 hunter, 53 hunter, 55 rogue, 54 pally and 49 druid. It took us 2 wipes before we managed to kill him. Too bad he dropped crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyorg</div><div class="date">04-18-05, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hakkar fight is hard.  You need a group that can handle back-to-back-to-back mobs.<br />
<br />
As for Jammal, there's a trick.  Jammal CHARMS not mezzes.  He turns his target into an orgre and sicks them on the rest of the group.  Now if Jammal is fighting a pet, he will charm that.  While the pet becomes an ogre, it stays fighting Jammal.  So send your group agains ogrom but send your pet against Jammal.  As an ogre, your pet will tank well.<br />
<br />
Shade is pretty strait up as far as fights go.  He will summon the type dragon mobs, (drakes and 4-legged dragon things, not the wind serpents).  Clear all of them.  From then he's just a High damage fight.  He stuns and sleeps but only 1 at a time so an offtank is helpful, but if your tank is holding agro, he'll stay on them after he stuns/sleeps and so it won't be a problem.  Make sure your healers conserve mana though.  I've had a 49 shaman heal the whole thing w/ a high dmg group.  On the other hand, I had a 49 druid and 53 shaman not be able to handle it.  (druid was feral and I had this conversation.)<br />
Me before attempt: Healers, conserve mana.  You will need it.  I repeat, don't waste your mana nuking.<br />
*wipe*<br />
Me: Why did we wipe?<br />
Mage: Healers couldn't keep up with healing.<br />
Shaman (in tells): Uh sorry.  I was nuking.  I won't nuke much next time.<br />
<br />
We wiped again and they went home so I brought in friends that could do it.</div></div><hr />
