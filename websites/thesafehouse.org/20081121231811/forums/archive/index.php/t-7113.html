<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Burglar Khing</div><div class="date">11-02-02, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the 61 SHAMAN pet:<br />
<br />
&quot;- Misses a lot less! <br />
- Has a lot more hit points than 55 pet. <br />
- Has insane regen. Goes from near death to full life in under 30 seconds. <br />
- Buffing 61 pet helps a LOT more than buffing 55 pet. <br />
- Procs with proccing weapons a lot more often than 55 pet. <br />
- Has high AC or good mitigation. Tanks punishers in PoJ without problems.<br />
 <br />
After parsing a full day of xp and PoJ trials, I have come to the following conclusion... <br />
<br />
Buffs: Focus of Spirit, Celerity, Spirit Quickening, 2x Velium Weapons <br />
AVG DPS: 45.78 Overall <br />
<br />
Also grouped with a Mage with his new pet in PoD. <br />
<br />
Buffs: Whatever mages buff pets with + Focus of Spirit, Celerity <br />
AVG DPS: 61.06 &quot;<br />
<br />
This rocks for dmg upgrades!<br />
<br />
Do the rest of the classes get dmg upgrades like this too? Please inform me. Rogues dmg upgrades? and rest of melee and casters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelthana</div><div class="date">11-02-02, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those numbers are meaningless unless they're testing their older pets as well. The damage increase could be more due to the PoP mob damage mitigation instead of an improvement in pets.<br />
<br />
How about a log with some pre-PoP pets fighting in PoP for comparison?</div></div><hr />

if you really are curious what upgrades rogues got with PoP, and that was your real reason for coming here, read any one of the many friggan threads about it in front of your face.</div></div><hr />

the pet was buffed with Focus/Virtue and Speed of Vallon just like us and its DPS hovered around 22 or so on the mobs in the wasteland... By comparsion a lvl 63 rogue was dealing EASILY six times as much DPS (130) and more towards the 145 DPS range, and a lvl 61 rogue was dealing roughly 130 DPS also. Wpns were Rage Main/primal off for both rogues.<br />
Frankly I don't feel concerned at all. Hell more power to them I hope every shaman buys swarm for 60 seconds of near rogue DPS ( swarm would be unbuffed though)... simply makes raids and groups that much more easy, fun, and interesting.<br />

<br />
And no i don't want shaman pets nerfed... my best friend is a shaman, and now he rocks even more to have our monk/rogue/shaman trio with... <br />
<br />
A friend of mine play 65 mage, he thinks their 60+ pets sucks... or he wants em better at least...  He currently only have 2 of them though...<br />
<br />
Sorry for any misunderstandings it caused... <br />
<br />
My question is maybe ebtter formulated is o frase it like this:<br />
Please post me logs from other casters and melees, and especially logs of rogues at 61+... I would like to see some, cause i think its interessting....</div></div><hr />

They're talking about a charmed level 57 mob from one of the upgraded charm spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Axterix EnObelix</div><div class="date">11-03-02, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Much of it depends on what you fight.  Pet damage drops down pretty quickly the further behind the mob's level they get.  As to 100 DPS, level 46 mobs buffed can hit that against even cons.  Boltran'd mobs exceeded it.  Now, a 57 capped charm with a dual wielding PoP mob...that'll be some extreme damage output and, most likely, an enchanter with a few deaths in his future</div></div><hr />

I (a warrior) found my own dps rose about 20% as I levelled from 60 to 65 using the same weapons.  I'm certain rogues got a similar upgrade.<br />
<br />
Some day when we feel like having a day of nostalgia, we'll go to Vex Thal and I'll parse boss mobs again and let you know how our rogues turned out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_VaryssTheShaman</div><div class="date">11-04-02, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our local uber monk was reporting ~200 dps in vex thal yesterday (I think actually about 191, but that was without savagery).  Granted this is one of the best equipped monks in all of EQ, but this is without any of the gear upgrades that must inevitably exist within PoP, and still lacking a few pieces from VT I believe.<br />
<br />
So by the time all is said and done pets will be probably lag comfortably behind most melees once again.<br />
<br />
btw-- I had my level 55 pet doing about 45 dps yesterday, so it wouldn't surprise me if the new pets, which con ~15 levels higher can approach twice that.  Not vs PoV mobs, but vs light blues in Luclin, yea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Latharek</div><div class="date">11-06-02, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, charming pets probably outputs more damage than any PC. <br />
<br />
Think level 62 charmed golems in PoV - triple for up to 544, proc a 300dd (quite a lot if you focus them). I need to parse them against a good ranger with AM3 to compare, but even unhasted I expect the pet outdamages. Hasted i'm pretty sure they would, but then I'm not really sure I can keep the group alive over many hours of xp grind if I keep a mob that size hasted.<br />
<br />
OF course, your uber monk/ranger/rogue will reasonably expect DPS to escalate over the course of the expansion, but then once i've maxed CA and CS i'll probably be hasting my charmed pets too. Preliminary fun with hasted charms in one fights against a named where we were about to lose otherwise confirms that the DPS goes totally insane when you haste (WR + SoV, thx stacking bug) and focus them and give them mage-summoned proc weapons.<br />
<br />
It also confirms that you *really* want charm to last the full 7.5 minutes after you've laid that sort of buff set on a mob that will kick your ass depressingly quickly unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Will repost once I've hassled the boyfriend into parsing one of these.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zaxxa65</div><div class="date">12-18-02, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note reguarding the Enchanter Charm -  the Spell Command of Druzzil will charm a level 64 mob - not just a level 57 mob.  <br />
<br />
What I normally do is only do this in a group, because when it Breaks and Im soloing - LOADING PLEASE WAIT - is what im going to see alot. <br />
<br />
But in a group I have alot of success if I tash the Mob then it is also Maloed and then Snared - I do not haste the charmed pet - but this way seems to last quite a while - and when it does Break charm I have no problem recharming it if its snared - I often dont even get hit. Also  with a good druid who knows to re snare it every time it becomes uncharmed, that helps alot as well. I have charmed the golems in the Factory in POI and  I dont know what the DPS was, but it was huge. <br />
<br />
The Risk to reward ratio is about right though.<br />
<br />
Another safe way to do it is with 2 enchanters in the group - we ping pong a single mob - when his charm breaks and it goes after him I can normally have it re charmed before it does to much damage to him - if any at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it was the DS potion.... rightclick 35 ds made it easy.. but I tried it later and was able to do the same thing, it just took a LOT longer... <br />
<br />
I still think mage pets rock though... and the gear they summon for the pets.... they need a higher DMG on them... I'd like to see a mage pet wield a weighted axe... =p<br />
