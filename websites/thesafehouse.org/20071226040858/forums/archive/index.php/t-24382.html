<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tsunami Channel (http://www.tsunamichannel.com/index.php) webcomic writer does some reviews as well.  He put up a listing so Ill post a copy here as well.<br />
<br />
He has a table but it didnt copy over well.  Follow the link to find it.<br />
Maybe someone knows the tags to make it display well here.<br />
<br />
    * A = I love this show so much I can't wait until next week.<br />
    * B = It's pretty good and I think I'm enjoying watching this show.<br />
    * C = It's so so. I'm little tired, but I'll keep watching.<br />
    * D = I'm getting tired of watching this show... Why am I torturing myself? <br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
    * &quot;Soul Link&quot; got better after the first fight (end of Ep. 3) and one of the terrorists turned into water and vaporized. Action scenes are bad most of the time... (low badget?), but I love the fact main characters don't show any mercy at all (They shoot bullets through terrorists heads to finish off). I thought end of episode 5 was really really cheesy, but it explains pretty well why terroriests didn't shoot her at episode 6. Not bad. Also I'm surprised they showed -not explicit- ecchi scenes -_-;... I hope the scene is related to the events later on (hope it wasn't for a fan service...) Enemy can link minds with others (and control?). Story might get interesting, I hope.<br />
<br />
    * &quot;Yoshinagasanchi no Gargoil&quot; is a cute show. All the characters are nice people (even bad villains) and a story always end up with a warm feeling.<br />
<br />
    * &quot;Black Lagoon&quot; is good, but I completely regret buying the manga since I know what will happen in anime... Pacing is little slow in my opinion. They should have finished off Nazi episode in two episodes. I can't wait for the kickass maid to come out. She is cool.<br />
<br />
    * &quot;Inukami&quot;'s Episode 2 was a total parody of &quot;Nausicca&quot;. I totally enjoyed it, but I'm not gay. The following episodes are not bad too.<br />
<br />
    * &quot;Higurashi no Nakukoroni&quot; - According to wiki, this series is 26 episodes long. I assume each mini-arc is about 4 episodes long and will end up in bloody tragedy (&quot;bad endings&quot;). From &quot;Meakashi&quot; arc on is called &quot;Solution/Answer&quot; arcs where the characters tried to solve the mystery and fight back to avoid &quot;bad endings&quot;.<br />
          o &quot;Onikakushi (ep.1-4)&quot;<br />
          o &quot;Watanagashi (ep.5-8?)&quot;<br />
          o &quot;Tatarigoroshi (ep.9-12?)&quot;<br />
          o &quot;Himatsubushi (ep.13-16?)&quot;<br />
          o &quot;Meakashi (ep.17-20?)&quot;<br />
          o &quot;Tumihoroboshi (ep.21-24?)&quot;<br />
          o &quot;Minagoroshi&quot; - might not be animated<br />
          o &quot;Matsuribayashi&quot; - the last of Higurashi game which will be out this summer) <br />
<br />
    * &quot;The Frogman Show&quot; was a total darkhorse. This FLASH anime series is funny as hell even though animation quality is bad as hell. This series might open up the door for web flash anime artists to have their own TV shows. I was quite surprised to see the TV commercial with &quot;Iyasakado (USHIGAERU animattion)&quot; between this show.</div></div><hr />
