Everything that I have been able to find on poisons being broke are all old posts, but I couldn't find any posts anywhere saying that they have been fixed.<br />
What is the current status on poisons?<br />
And would I be better off not max'ing envenom? <br />

<br />
I guess it depends on what you mean by broken...<br />
<br />
Currently, high level DOT's do not do much damage, Lifebane at about 55 per tic, for 5 tics, compared to other casted DOT's, doing much much more (from what i've heard about 100 per tic).<br />
<br />
Strength Debuff.  Got reduced greatly after the new buff system went in.  That was my favorite poison for first hit, I still use it, but it's not as effective anymore.<br />
<br />
Snare.  Breaks after hit... bad.<br />
<br />
Disease has a 25% speed reduction that does not break, hinders healing, stops natural healing, and a debuff as well. Nice, but I thought its primary purpose was for RvR, but kinda useless since you can only use it once in a combat situation, and if you unstealth near a large group to hit somebody -  say goodbye anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, Lifebane essentially adds another hit per round, inturrupts casting, etc - which is VERY nice.  Reducing the amount of time in comabt, as i'm sure you know is essential.<br />
<br />
Snares are a good escape method.  <br />
<br />

<br />
It's not that i'd say they are broken, just not as potent as i'd like.  But i'm sure if Mythic intends for it to be one of the three big rogue abilities, they will make it worth while in the end.  So, spec how you want.  <br />
<br />
Also, +ENV items allow you to apply higher level poisons and do not work like weapon bonuses.  Realm ranks also work too.  So, if you want to go full spec in ENV, save a few points and use items and ranks to get to 50 (i'm only going 41 or 42 in ENV).  I know you can get a total of 11 at 50, but I don't know how many Albion ENV items are out there (I think hib has the highest so far, a total of  .<br />
<br />
I hope that helps some,</div></div><hr />
