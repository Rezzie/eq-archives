<br />
Be consistant ban any alcohol that tastes good or &quot;like Candy&quot; ban this kids will just smoke or drink the next easiest thing to get. I mean teens seem to love beer and it tastes like goat piss. Guess I'll just have to get my beedies the same way I get other illigal items.  <br />

<br />
I grew up around smokers most of my life. When I was 13 and tried my first cigarette I took a deep drag of it and didnt flinch or gag at all. I was already used to the smoke and I had never even smoked before.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying ban it, I'm saying bring it outdoors only in designated areas. The only place I still find it a problem is in bowling allys, when a group of old farts next to you decide its time for a smoke break and start puffing away right next to you and little kids near you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't go around blowing smoke at other people to see if I can kill them. I smoke where it is allowed, complaining about smoke in places where it is allowed is like walking on the freeway and getting mad at those pesky cars trying to kill you.<br />
<br />
I think the only public places that allow smoking anymore are bowling alleys and Mars.<br />
<br />
For some reason I can't help but picture the one scene from Trigger Happy TV where the guy is in a Grim Reaper costume starting at a bunch of smokers looking at his watch occasionally.<br />
<br />
Point of this rant was not pro/non smoker debate, and I didn't help that much. For those that don't smoke, Kudos good for you.  It's the gov't getting stupid and in my eye's taking away personal choice.</div></div><hr />

&quot;They now say each cigarette you smoke takes five minutes off the end of your life, but think about it, those are the years you are in @#%$ diapers and don't @#%$ remember your own name, so who wants to @#%$ live at that point anyway?&quot;<br />

I don't really like that quote, because what about the years at the end of your life when you are stuck hacking up a lung because of the emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Hell, you'll just grow old and be in those diapers before me.<br />

If you dislike smoking in bars and restaurents, well, move to nazi Florida. Or go to a restaurent that doesn't want smokers in it - they certainly do exist.

If it were really getting technical, I'd point out that what he called fascism has nothing to do with:<br />
<br />
A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism. <br />
