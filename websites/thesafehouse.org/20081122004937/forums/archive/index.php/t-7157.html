Let's take a look at customer support at its finest.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:45:47 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'hello Asema, GM Kimbial here...do you have a moment to talk?'<br />
<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:46:00 2003] You told Kimbial, 'Yes'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:46:07 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'can you tell me what happened last night'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:47:36 2003] You told Kimbial, 'Ok I obtained my Refined Ancient Blade after some hard work, im suppose to turn it in to Thelin and Faelin (sp) spawns. I handed it to thelin he hands it back (like he's suppose to) and I hand it to the lady, she comments something about making sure it got into the right hands and ate it , im guessing due to my level. I hailed her for about 2 hours trying to get a guide to see the situation but none ever showed'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:48:30 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'that is correct, players below the level of 50 should not receive an epic'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:48:54 2003] You told Kimbial, 'Yet every NPC responded to me and even handed me each item they requested'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:49:16 2003] You told Kimbial, 'I don't wish to have the epic rewarded to me, just the Refined Ancient Sword so i can level to level 50 and redo the turn in'<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:49:23 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'yes, I saw that with you trades'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:50:57 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'I am afraid I am going to decline, you will have to redo the quest when you are of the appropriate level'<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:51:15 2003] You told Kimbial, 'Why? Not one NPC told me of this level requirement'<br />
<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:51:40 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'the quest failed because of your level, no reimbursment is available'<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:52:03 2003] You told Kimbial, 'I've completed the entire quest, you can see that in all my trade logs. I don't wish my epic to be refunded just the item I lost due to a requirement I wasn't aware of'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:54:10 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'I do not know how to explain it to you better....the quest failed, the quest was not bugged, there is no reimbursal, I do regret that you took the time before you should have to do this quest that is not available at your level'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:55:16 2003] You told Kimbial, 'So wait, nowhere in the quest does it tell me Im to low, and unlike other quest where they will give you the item back if they dont want it this one chooses to EAT my item, and I can't even get a reimbursal for the item eaten'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:55:42 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'that is correct'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:56:24 2003] You told Kimbial, 'So why can't my Refined Ancient Sword be reimbursed? It's obviously a problem on the games side to let me obtain all these items then to eat it , not my own'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:56:56 2003] You told Kimbial, 'I even still have the other sword for the Earthcaller in my bags'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 18:58:42 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'that is great that you were able to get so far, now you know not to turn it in until you are of the level to receive it'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 19:00:46 2003] You told Kimbial, 'get so far? The swiftwind was completed. That was the final turn in. The quest allows me to finish every part of the quest but not get the reward , and instead of handing it back or telling me to wait till 50 it will eat it. And you expect me to redo the quest at level 50? Take an apology and skip along my way...how exactly is this CS, im receiving no support,I didnt' design this NPC's who maybe shouldnt have given me the quest to give it to me or to han dme items i shouldnt have gotten. '<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 19:01:13 2003] You told kimbial, 'it took them all and now that its gone i get a pat on my back and told basically better luck next time but your screwed'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 19:09:09 2003] You told kimbial, 'Is there a reason you allow the quest to be completed until the final turn by any level and then have the last piece eaten without warning? The lady Faelin i think, even responded to my hails and Thelin TOLD me to give her the sword, you can look all this up. I did what the quest told me to do and I get nothing out of it, not even a reimbursal or the item handed back to me by the NPC'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 19:10:37 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'I do not allow for anything in regards to quest NPCs'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 19:11:12 2003] You told Kimbial, 'You see the problem in the quest obviously and yet nothing is done about it tho right? Not even a refund for losses'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 19:11:57 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'there is nothing wrong with the quest, it is designed for 50 +, I regret your loss but I am unable to assist you with it'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 19:13:00 2003] You told Kimbial, 'don't be so arrogant about it. You see the problem in the fact that it never once says its designed for level 50+,  how exactly am i suppose to have known this?'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 19:13:19 2003] You told Kimbial, 'when i gave thelin the sword he didnt say ' sorry your not level 50 ' '<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 19:14:15 2003] You told Kimbial, 'why on ever other quest will the NPC tell you he has no need for the item and hand it back, but on this one it's simply DESTROYED?'<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 08 19:14:18 2003] Kimbial tells you, 'our converstation is over, please e-mail eqcsr@soe.sony.com reference the issue, I still wish you a good night and safe hunting'<br />

Note: EQCSR@soe.sony.com isn't even a legit email. I had to log back on and get the real one after trying to send my email. The actual address is EQCS@soe.sony.com.<br />

<br />
its common knowledge that you should not do<br />
Epic before 50.<br />
To get my Epic started i have to be lvl 50 before my<br />
NPC starts my Quest (Wizard).<br />
<br />
Im not sure if every NPC checks it but i doubt it !<br />
<br />
So i am afraid the GM was right.<br />
But i really understand that you are upset ...<br />

<br />
By stating that your NPC will not even start the quest till you are 50 only reenforces his point. His point is that if his epic was not to be done before level 50 than why did every single NPC up to that point allow him to do the quest only to arrive at the very end and have the quest item he had aquired thru all of the various turnins eaten.<br />
<br />
If the quest is not meant to be completed before 50 than the NPC's involved should not interact with the PC until such time as he/she has aquired sufficiant levels.<br />

<br />
If you are indeed able to complete all of the Quest without any NPC refusing to talk or trade with you because of level, how should you know that you can`t finish the quest until level 50? That's what responses like &quot;you are not yet powerful enough&quot; are for.<br />

The GM should have reinbursed the last quest piece, no doubt about it. Veteran ShadowCross Bladesong<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Azzitay</div><div class="date">02-19-03, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes he should have reimbursed it,<br />
<br />
but he don´t have to ... thats the slight difference.<br />
<br />
I would try it again ... and hope for another GM.<br />
All GMs are People like you and me judging by their own views ...<br />
And i met mostly nice GMs till now ... some refused politely to help me , some did not ...<br />
Always depends ...<br />
<br />
(to clarify : I think he should have reimbursed the Item , but he is not inclined to, because you did a mistake.<br />
If i am not Mistaken the First (!!) NPC to start your Epic checks your Level ... if you skip it and &quot;MQ&quot; your way through it , and the last NPC checks again your Level and eats your Item it is your fault ... no doubt. BUT it is clearly an achievement to get all the pieces , so a kind (!!!) GM would reimburse it... really bad you got a not so nice one...)<br />
<br />
My advice ... try again , send an E-Mail etc. until you meet a nice GM ... be polite and ask nicely with a Please and you may get it back.<br />

<br />
That's the question.. if he didn't skip NPCs, and didn't MQ any parts, then the GM should have been required to hand back the item, and the quest should be fixed.<br />
<br />
If he skipped NPCs or did MQs, then  he shouldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Quiet</div><div class="date">02-19-03, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A question....<br />
<br />
We don't know the entire picture... but were there some high level assistance on his epic that was 50+? Didn't any of them mention the 50+ requirement for all epics (or even their epic)? Was there a 50+ character on the same account with an epic?<br />
<br />
Why are these important? If the person should have known that epics are 50+, and the trade logs available to the GM or guide showed this, then the response is reasonable. Also, if epics are not normally to be begun until 50, then again, there is no reason to give the piece back because it can be begun again at 50... the only time it is valid. (Giving back the piece, in fact, would be wrong if they actually fixed the first epic guy in fact.)<br />
<br />
That said, it does suck to lose the epic after putting in the time and effort, and I too am sorry for your loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bleyse</div><div class="date">02-19-03, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Telin Darkforest is the NPC that begins the epic quest for rangers and druids.  He is located in Burning woods.  To begin the quest you must hail him, and ask him &quot;what action should I take&quot;.  I know from personal experience that he will NOT begin the quest for you if you are under the level of 50.  The druid and ranger epics are pretty much the same quest up until after the Venril Sathir's remains part, at which point it differs for each respective class.  It is possible to MQ it somewhere along the line.<br />
<br />
How did you get the note from Telin?  Did you get the note from Telin at all to begin that quest?  If you did, then there is obviously some sort of bug.  I have been told by Telin in not so many words to bugger off till I was stronger.  It looks to me like MQ'ing had to take place to get a pre-50 toon to this point in the epic quest.  Sorry about your loss, but if you MQ'd any part of this quest with the intent to get around Telin not starting it, then you know now why it was necessary to be of appropriate level first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Wristie</div><div class="date">02-20-03, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with one of the above posters who suggested trying again and hoping for a more understanding GM.<br />
<br />
I once had a pair of Lodi Boots stolen from me (yes, yes I know - it was my fault, I hit trade and the guy never logged on the toon with the cash, blah, blah, blah).  The point is I felt I was wronged, so I created an alt, buddied up to this guy in game, and got him to admit he ripped off my main.  I /report -ed him and the GM said that even though he admitted the theft, he couldn't give me back my boots.  I just /petitioned every night thereafter... night 2 - no response, night 3 - diff. GM said tough luck even though I had a confession, night 4 - no response, night 5 - no response, night 6 - nice GM who said he had recieved complaints about this guy before, but never had a /report with him actually admitting a theft.  He thanked me for helping nail the guy and gave me back my boots.<br />

Just try, try again until you get a GM who sees things the way you do...<br />

<br />
I must be weird; I wouldnt dream of doing an epic for a toon till he was 50+ and if I ever did a trade where the person would log on another toon and got scammed, I would figure I deserved it for being so stupid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AsturiasAurora</div><div class="date">03-07-03, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shalatain (and others), I don't know what has changed and when it changed, but I took my ranger into BW with some guildies at lvl 35 to hunt and talked to Telin and started the epic quest then (this was about a year and a half ago though).  He did not say anything regarding level.  My faction was maxed at the time with him and he gladly responded to my questions at lvl 35.  Due to other delays it wasn't until lvl 51 that I got to the final Swiftwind turnin anyways though   <br />
<br />
I agree, some GMs aren't nearly as 'good' at their jobs as they like to believe.  Keep the petition in and fight it every step of the way.  If an NPC does not see you as the correct level, he/she should not respond with the quest information.  I know my rogue didn't get any response from the lady in the sewers until lvl 50 (I tried at 35, 40 and 45 as well, just to test it).  In fact, most of the information I got regarding the quest was what was told to me by others; which is the only reason I knew about the lvl 50 thing.  I don't remember any NPC mentioning it along the way...<br />

Hence you cant get them till 50.<br />
<br />
And i agree, i got into a problem a while back, just petition till a GM answers you, and sees what happened as the NPC eating the item, even if (most) everyone knows you cant get them by 50, not everyone does.<br />

What total BS.  Why didn't the GM just come out and say, &quot;Sorry, but you should have looked OUTSIDE the game for more info before doing this quest.&quot;  Because that was obviously his opinion.  Just goes to show that SOE relies on the community to keep itself informed, and screw those who don't want to visit the spoiler sites.<br />
<br />
You hailed an NPC, that NPC gave you instructions for a quest, and you followed the instructions. You did everything SOE told you to do and it was a long hard raod to get it all done, and at the end of the road there was a representitive of SOE to spit in your face.<br />
<br />
You had every right to be angry, every right.  I think everything you said to the GM was in line with what any human being would feel after investing the amount of time you spent at the comp doint this quest would feel.<br />
<br />
This is an example of the very worst Everquest has to offer.<br />
