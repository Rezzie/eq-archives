<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiddenpaw</div><div class="date">05-31-07, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PVP in this game will never be good, nor in any other game that isn't designed from the ground up with it in mind. The classes are not even balanced properly for PVE much less PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lobo</div><div class="date">06-01-07, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do agree that PvP in Vg is really unbalanced, but I gotta say FFA pvp is really fun...<br />
<br />
I used to play a druid and could own most of other classes...<br />
Now I play a rogue and PvP is way more chalenging this way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythdarr</div><div class="date">06-01-07, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pretty much try to avoid PVP since the day I ended up against a Druid with the anti-snare/stun hack. (Hack makes you walk at max bard speed, prevents all forms of snare/stun and movement reduction, this includes spell cast.)<br />
<br />
I should probably post the screen shot of my combat log that goes like this:<br />
<br />
Your Clout hits Hacker stunning him.<br />
<br />
Hacker pulls a star from the sky hitting you for 3800 dmg &lt;- Non-crit<br />
<br />
Hacker pulls a star from the sky hitting you for 3800 dmg &lt;- Non-crit<br />
<br />
:rip <br />
<br />
Then well Evac and res-kill for more infamy... <br />
<br />
:rip <br />
<br />
Release to bind.<br />
<br />
So on top of un-balanced/bugs classes (Thinking about Ravage stun not working)  we have to deal with cheaters.<br />
<br />
When someone asks me how rogues do in pvp... my reply is :rofl</div></div><hr />
