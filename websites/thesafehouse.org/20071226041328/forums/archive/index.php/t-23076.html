<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">02-27-06, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got two separate anime orders dropped off at my doorstep a little while ago.  While I ordered Kino's Journey (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1965) in December, it ended up being back ordered and after a couple months I ended up with  Azumanga Daioh (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=799) as a replacement.  It's not really the typical type of anime I'd get, but I've got a good sense of humour and reviewers seem to love it, so I don't think I'll worry too much about not getting Kino's Journey.  Heck, I paid $24 for Kino's Journey and they're giving me an item that's twice as expensive in place of it.<br />
<br />
Next up on my new pile-o-anime is Haibane Renmei (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1871).  I decided a while ago that I had to get it based on everything I'd read about it, and the screenshots I'd seen.  From there it's onto RahXephon (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=849).  I've read people arguing about RahXephon vs. Neon Genesis Evangelion, so I had to see the whole thing for myself.  Topping it all off is Volume 3 of Cowboy Bebop (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13).<br />
<br />
1,750 minutes worth of anime arriving at one time.  I have a feeling I'll be busy for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">02-27-06, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.) Kino's Journey = awesome. The atmosphere this show creates is astounding.<br />
2.) Azumanga Daioh = awesome. I suggest the japanese vocals, however- quite a bit of the humor gets lost in the translation.<br />
3.) Haibane Renmei = awesome. yet another atmospheric piece with a cozy, 'mystery' feel to it.<br />
4.) RahXephon = Amazingly, I've never seen this one.<br />
5.) Cowboy Bebop = awesome. I'm prolly going to get the 'remix' enchanced set sometime soon, even tho I allready own the series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-27-06, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's best to ignore the NGE vs RahXephon sentiments. It's just elitist bull****, and I'll be REALLY elitist here - NGE itself is nothing new either, it's a rip off of the other Mecha series before it. :p<br />
<br />
Don't think too much about it, and enjoy RahXephon as a show on it's own.<br />
<br />
EDIT: For the sake of being clear, I was joking on the &quot;really elitist&quot; part, even though the statement itself is true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, at 2 stories per episode, it's hard to get tired of a gag. By the time you're bored with the joke, the next one which you might enjoy will begin. So it has something for everyone and it's always fresh. I enjoyed it.</div></div><hr />

&lt;holds his comments about NGE&gt; :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">02-27-06, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Comparing something to NGE is like comparing something to an Uwe Boll film.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xynn</div><div class="date">02-27-06, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the song to Azumanga Diaoh stuck in my head while I was watching it...and right now(Thanks a lot!). I liked it, definately not giant mech robots battling to destroy the world, but better than the OC, thats for dang sure. <br />
<br />
Side question: For those of you who prefer the japanese vocals, are you suggesting subtitles, or suggesting knowing japanese? Cause I can do subtitles, but without them, its not gonna happen. I watch Diaoh with english vocals and it was still pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">02-27-06, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Subtitles. I can't understand spoken japanese at all, so subby-titles FTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">02-28-06, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't usually watch them subtitled until after I've watched them at least once with the english dub.  That way I already know the general direction of the scene and I won't miss any visual stuff while reading the text.  The english script and the japanese script can sometimes vary quite a bit, usually to the detriment of the series though.  The first that comes to mind is Samurai Gun.  I thought the english script used way too many expletives that aren't in the japanese version.  It was like the scriptwriter was doing the actors' job of making the characters sound angry (through swearing) instead of letting the voice actors do their jobs.  To be honest though, today's english dubs are generally very good.  Some (GitS:SAC is a good example) are even considered to have a dub just as good, if not better than their japanese language counterparts.<br />
<br />
I've watched the first disk of RahXephon and to be honest so far it seems to take more from 'The Matrix' than NGE.  It is interesting though, so I think I'll enjoy the series.<br />
<br />
I also watched the first couple episodes of Haibane Remei and so far I'm really liking what I see.  I'm trying to will myself not to just sit down and mow through the entire series (it's only 13 episodes so I could be done in under 6 hours).  I haven't yet started on Azumanga Diaoh, but I think I might start on the first disk sometime today.<br />
<br />
There are still a few series that I want to get though; I still want Kino's Journey, and I'm also considering SaiKano.  With one of my earlier orders I got the first disk of Chrono Crusade for free which has gotten me to consider getting the thinpack for that series (I didn't think 'nuns with guns fighting demons in 30s era New York' would appeal to me, but the production values seem very good and I was interested in where the story was heading).  Then there's Berserk, which about the only reason I haven't bothered to get it is because I've already seen it twice (the rental place near me has all six disks).  Unfortunately it's a case of 'Too many good anime series, too few winning lottery tickets'.<br />
<br />
As for NGE and Uwe Boll, they don't belong in the same sentence unless that sentence is &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion is as good as Uwe Boll's directing is bad.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">02-28-06, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's why I generally watch the subtitled version first, unless I know that the dub is generally considered well-done. (CB, GitS:SAC) Going through a joke-heavy series like AzuDai once with less-than-optimal dailogue just kills it for me. If I tried to go back and watch the subs after watching the dub, I'd be constantly comparing the two instead of enjoying the show. Also, the 'suprise' moments would be ruined, where a character's reaction is the joke in itself. Japanese seiyuu just have the edge when it comes to emotional humor in voices. Compare an american voice actor saying a comedic &quot;WHAT?!?!?!&quot; to a seiyuu saying &quot;NANI?!?!?!?!?&quot; and you'll hear the difference.<br />
 <br />
Just my 2cp. Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />

hahha you just said nani! :P. Nani is such a cool word :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-28-06, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd strongly advise against Chrono Cruscade. It's not that the series is horrible, but it's nowhere near on-par with everything else on your to-watch pile. If you must blow your money on someting, buy the first 10 volumes of Berserk manga. You won't regret it. It is infinitely better than the anime.<br />
<br />
Have you seen Fighting Spirit? That's the sleeper hit series, with 10 volumes so far, and 5 more to go. WIth five episodes per DVD, you're getting a hell of a deal. It's 75 episodes total with two OVA's and a movie. Best of it's genre, which is sports. I doubt anyone would really debate that out of anything but very specific personal preference.<br />
<br />
SaiKano is good too. Depressing, but good. If you are interested in another excellent series, Crest of the Stars, Banner of the Stars, and Banner of the Stars II are all great series, the recent Banner of the Stars III which hasn't been released in the USA yet was mind blowing.</div></div><hr />
