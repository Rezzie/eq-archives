I assume there are far more examples out there to be found and that possibly the sketches are usefull as wildcards and not even truly required for poisons. I look forward to seeing some more combines found that live up to verants promise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a great idea!  I will try some combinations with my master sketch tonight.  I would guess this would work with those poisons that have 2 farmed ingreadiants or more so as to define the poison.  We will see.<br />
