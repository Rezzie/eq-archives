<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">11-02-07, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not entirely optimal, but there's this (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=f0eboLxZMjV0rVzxMhot).<br />
<br />
While some mixed-spec builds are popular, they almost all use Swords for the offhand, since a Sword Specialization proc from the offhand will trigger a -mainhand- swing.  If you put a dagger in your offhand, then you may as well skip Dagger Specialization entirely, since offhand crits are moderately irrelevant - they're certainly not worth spending 5 talent points on.  Therefore, the build I linked has Sword Spec, but no Dagger Spec.<br />
<br />
The one advantage of that build is that Combat Potency is massively affected by offhand speed - the faster the better, and each 0.1s counts.  Generlly speaking, daggers are faster than swords, so when you're looking for the fastest offhand you can possibly find, daggers are a pretty good place to look.  The Searing Sunblade (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29275) would be the ideal offhand for that build, with a Merciless Gladiator's Slicer (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32052) mainhanded.</div></div><hr />

I wish there were options for mixed styles. =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true; I played Fist/Sword for a while because...well...those were the best weapons I had  ;p  and it was entirely viable.  Mainhanding the Big Bad Wolf's Paw, offhanding Latro's, and it worked just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-05-07, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some things to consider with mixed weapon builds-<br />
<br />
For sword spec, the bulk of your extra attacks comes from the mainhand. <br />
<br />
Combat potency I think procs just as well from a quick off hand dagger as it does a sword. <br />
<br />
However, if you are sword spec you get even more combat potency from additional offhand sword spec procs. <br />
<br />
Sword/dagger, sword/fist is a better use of talent points and you get more out of it than main hand dagger, off hand sword, sword spec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">11-05-07, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For sword spec, the bulk of your extra attacks comes from the mainhand. <br />
<br />
You're actually off on that one - remember, Combat Potency demands the fastest possible offhand you can find, and you always want a slow mainhand regardless of the situation simply because slower weapons are always better per-hit on instant attacks due to their higher damage.<br />
<br />
The inherent desire for fast offhand and slow mainhand means that the offhand's SS procs will be triggering many, many more mainhand attacks than the mainhand's SS procs - that's why Sword works very well for offhand in dual-specs, since you get both the benefit of SS and CP.  With either Daggers or Fists offhand and a different mainhand, you'd want to skip Dagger Spec / Fist Spec, but the offhand sword rewards you both coming and going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-06-07, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the combination of SS (I throw about 500 in 4 hour period) plus haste, gave you more sword spec procs off the mainhand. We came to this conclusion because a rogue in my raid was using an offhand sword with sword spec, dagger main hand, and his total sword spec procs were about 1/3rd of mine. If what you were saying were true, he should have had at least 1/2+ as many sword spec procs as me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">11-07-07, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the speed of his offhand.  =&gt;  Keep in mind that any and all haste effects are applied equally to both hands, as well, so S&amp;D/BF/Assination-2-pc/etc will benefit offhand-proc sword spec hits just as much as mainhand.<br />
<br />
Sin Strikes are a fair point tho, you're correct.  However, if you're mainhanding a Fist weapon and have Fist Spec 5, then +5% Crit with SSs is, long term, very roughly equal to 5% chance to get an additional hit with SSs.  In additional, you get the synergy of your offhand's SS procs triggering a MH hit which then has +5% Crit - best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
It's certainly possible that a MH-only Sword Spec will give you more procs than an OH-only Sword Spec, but if your percentage of extra hits above him was equal to his percentage of crit chance above you, then I'd guess (items, skill, etc., all being equal) that you'd both parse out similarly.  Obviously that would be theorycraft parsing, however, since Daggers have real-world issues that aren't evident in paper theory.</div></div><hr />

Its always me with a pure combat swords build versus other combat something builds, so isolating contributors for damage can be tricky. <br />
<br />
Its always seemed to me after my 50s though that speccing in WoW works better when you commit to a certain build rather than trying to mix and match. Like Cao said, its pretty lamentable, especially for rogues these days.</div></div><hr />
