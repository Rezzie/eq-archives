<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-22-05, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some older series plugs:<br />
<br />
Kamichu!, Monster are excellent series. Kaleido Star: New Wings is going on sale in December, support the release! If you missed out, the thinpack with a very BEAUTIFUL box is coming out for the first season. Support it too!<br />
<br />
Animal Yokocho- B<br />
<br />
Very cute series. At first, I thought it was from the creator of Full Moon o Saga****e, but I was wrong. The girl looks a lot like Mitsuki. It's a cute show about a girl who has a door in her room to a land of animals. Based on the first episode alone, it's just about kids having fun. Not in the way Ichigo Mashimaro is, but more like, childish, for children. Not childish, for adults. I liked it. If you can stand children's show, and cutesy things, you'll like this one. I am trying to think of a good comparision, but nothing's coming to mind.<br />
<br />
Aria the Animation- A+<br />
<br />
The manga is wonderful. There is no real story, it's more of a showcase of beauty and emotions. The changing of the seasons, a life with slow pace, calmness and peace and tranquility. It's a show that invokes emotions, rather than thought or excitement. As the seasons change, the subtle differences occur, you learn the beauty of life.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, the anime will capture the feel of the manga. The story revolves around Neo Aqua, a man-made planet that has a very striking, if not exact, resemblance to Veince. It revolves around a few girls who are training to become Udines. Udines are the people who row small canoes around the city to transport people, almost like a water taxi.<br />
<br />
With the first episode, it really catches the general feel of the show, but it was a little more exciting than it usually is. But I felt content with the way they introduced the characters. The personalities fit very well, and it was very interesting to watch. But I'm hoping they focus a little less on the story like it tried to in the first episode, and more on the atmosphere like the manga does.<br />
<br />
Black Cat- C<br />
<br />
The manga has a hardcore cult following, but I could not get into the anime. I'll be giving it a few more episodes. It tries to be mysterious for no particular reason, which gives me the chills more than it does intruge me. But it's very typical shallow for a shounen show. It looks like it will have a fair bit of action in it. There's no particular story going on right now, so I can't really define the show yet.<br />
<br />
Blood+ B+<br />
<br />
The animation was good, and I have a thing for innocent girls turned bloody murderers. It's an adaptation of Blood The Last Vampire. Set in the same world, but completely different. The first episode worried me a bit because it had the same &quot;fake mysterious&quot; feel as Black Cat did, but it was a little more well-done. The second episode redeemed this aspect somewhat, as they moved the story along fairly fast.<br />
<br />
The opening scene of the first episode was among the most intense I've seen yet. If you have bandwidth to spare, it would not be too bad to check the opening alone out. And the show too, if you like. They animate the fights decently, even if it's a bit fast and there's some &quot;poofing&quot; where they disappear and reappear elsewhere, leaving it to your imagination how they got there. Still good, though, better than most.<br />
<br />
Canvas 2- C<br />
<br />
I thought it was a little cute, but the story just moves at a blazing fast speed. Plot development that usually takes most anime 5 episodes, in one episode. I got a bit dizzy, I think. The show pretty much is similar to your typical bishoujo anime. Guy with many girls. A lot of little sister complex fanservice in the first episode.<br />
<br />
But, it felt very... odd. Like the reason why the girl didn't like red. It just felt shallow and 2D, even for a bishoujo anime where 2D girls are penny a dozen. Doesn't seem great, but it's not bad either.<br />
<br />
Cluster Edge- B-<br />
<br />
It seems to be a bishounen show. So that scared me off, for the most part. But I prevailed and watched the episode. It seems to be a show created tomake excuses to have yaoi, but it might have something interesting to it. I gave it a B for it's potentional to be good, so it might turn bad or good here. A lot of pretty boys, a lot of story setup. It has a old world feel (no technoloogy) with some random technology thrown in for good measure. <br />
<br />
Requires a ****load of suspense of disbelief. A pistol that can destroy a car in one shot, and they have trouble against two cars. Stuff like that. A guy goes to save another pretty boy for no particular reason, and destroys his own ship in the process. For no particular reason.<br />
<br />
Jingoku Shoujo A<br />
<br />
This show, I feel, has the highest potentional out of all the shows so far. It is not exceedingly amazing or intruging, but it has such a good idea for a story that, if well executed, could end up being one of the best anime of the season. The title translates to Hell Girl.<br />
<br />
Basically, there's this girl who ferries people to hell. At midnight, if you type in an specific url, they will take revenge on someone for you. After typing their name in, they will contact you and explain the terms of the contract. They will kill the object of your revenge and take them to hell for all of eternity, in exchange for your soul. You will live, until you die until your natural causes, but you pretty much deny yourself admittance to heaven, and they get to take your soul and bring you to hell.<br />
<br />
The animation is very beautiful, and chilling. It reminded me a bit of Gankutsuou, and Le Portrait de Petite Cossette.<br />
<br />
Mai-Otome B+<br />
<br />
I'll get a lot of hate for the grade, but I was not much of a fan of Mai-HiME in the first place. I like how they did this second show, though. It seems very interesting, and the characters feel very unique. I don't feel like I'm watching the same show again, even though many of the old cast are still there.<br />
<br />
It feels absolutely the same as Mai-HiME in general, though. Can't say if that's a good or bad thing. The first three episodes have kept my interest, which says a lot, really. Check out Mai-HiME before watching this, if you like that, you'll like this. But that aside, the two show shave nothing to do with each other, so bypassing HiME would be just fine.<br />
<br />
Shoujo-ai still going strong in this series, as it did the last. Somewhat glad to see that.<br />
<br />
Noein- A-<br />
<br />
When I watched this episode, I thought that Studio 4C made an new TV series. Much to my disappointment, they did not. The animation style is very remniscent of it. There's not much to the story so far, but the atmosphere and intensity is spot on. A lot of potentional.<br />
<br />
There's not much story revealed so far. From what I can see, there is a world outside of this. And this other world is trying to take something called the Dragon's Torque. Reasons are not clear yet. Would have to watch more. But, the animation alone makes this show worth watching.<br />
<br />
Shakugan no SHANA- C<br />
<br />
The show feels very generic. Burning red hair, eyes, cute, and I'm in love. Has a katana to boot. But the show seems to be very much pointless. Not much in the way of action, and the story feels very generic. Seems that everyone in the planet died, and their containers remained, and mosnsters want to eat the containers. Get it? Neither did I. Cute girl makes me watch more, but doesn't have much going for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
This time around, I actually reviewed it when the first episodes were coming out. There's still a lot more coming out, notably for me, Rozen Maiden Traumied. So I can't give a detailed review of the stories, only whatever plot was revealed in the first episodes. Thought it might help so you guys don't have to watch every episode to pick what you want.<br />
<br />
I'll be updating in new replies with new information, final thoughts, etc later on. Some of the series I can give insight on that I didn't review:<br />
<br />
Ginga Densetsu Weed- A story about dogs that live in secluded mountains. Very different than your typical anime. A side story to Nagareboshi Gin.<br />
<br />
Paradise Kiss- Very trendy anime. Also very different than your typical anime. Will give better insight later on.<br />
<br />
GPZ Cyber Formula Zero- F1 Racing.<br />
<br />
To Heart 2- Bishoujo anime based on a game of the same name. The first game was a smash hit.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I reeeealy liked Mai-HiME, so I had to check out Mai-Otome. I'm waiting for StaticSubs* ep 3, then I'll post a counter review to Stalkyr's. <br />
*I watched thier sub of M-H, so i kinda had to follow the trend, ya?<br />
 <br />
All in all, I'm waiting for Rozen Maiden Traumied as well, the first series was very suprisingly good, so if M-O doesn't turn out to be interesting, hopefully i can at least follow this, or vice-versa. Or maybe I can steal corn dogs from the 7-11 as my new hobby. We shall see....</div></div><hr />

I typically just download whatever comes out first for the first few episodes, until I can see what groups are keeping up with the series, what groups are too slow, etc, then I deciede which group to stick with. <br />
<br />
Sorry Shebab, you're right, it's Jigoku Shoujo. I must've gotten confused, somehow.</div></div><hr />

I don't think C's for Canvas 2 and Black Cat are fair at all, I'd give at least B+ to both.<br />
<br />
Blood+ A+ IMO story seems to be great, action, superb animation, in 2nd episode instead of stupid last episode review bit they start off where the 1st stopped which I really liked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, I found it very forgettable. I don't remember exactly how they defined it, so I skimmed it over. The odds are, when I watch the second episode, I'll probably remember and post a better explaination of the series. Unless I think it is as bad as I think it will turn out, then I won't even bother.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't watched it yet, that's all. It's on my to-watch list, most likely today. I've been busy watching Urusei Yatsura again (4th time in 8 years :D ) so I've put many series on hold for a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm certainly blown away, really. I've skimmed the first chapter or two of the manga, and didn't pick it up. The odd character designs made me not feel too interested in it.<br />
<br />
But, the animation and design of the first two episodes really is incredible. I felt a certain nostilaga when I watched it, then I realized it was because the main character reminds me a lot of Maho from Beck. The pacing and style of the show feels very much similar.<br />
<br />
It gives off a great atmosphere. Not too fast, not too slow. Not too serious, but not too simple. The people in the show are all very interesting, and the animation style really brings out their personalities. For someone like me, who is not interested in fashion at all, I could really see how their personalities are reflected by their clothes. That makes the show all the more better.<br />
<br />
Seeing their very unique clothes change constantly really gives the show a new life. There are many shows that have characters change clothes a lot, but usually it's not noticeable. But you can really notice and appreciate it in this show.<br />
<br />
All impressions of the animation aside, the story is fairly basic so far. A group of clothes designers who are trying to find someone to be their model. Typically, I would brush it off as a simple story, but I also know from experience how intense these type of shows can get. Beck is the easy one that comes to mind. It's just about a band who finds a singer and tries to hit big time. Simple, but very intense.<br />
<br />
Given the length I am writing on this show, I can really start to see how impressed I am with the show. I sincerely hope it maintains it's pace and really does well. The one thing that worries me is the animation plays a huge part in this show. The second the clothes and designs look dull, is when the show will really turn for the worse, so hopefully they have a good budget to work with.<br />
<br />
Overall, excellent release, one of the better ones of the season.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, remembering the shows you like, I think you should enjoy Paradise Kiss.<br />
<br />
Ginban Kaleidoscope- C+<br />
<br />
I think that this show has a little bit of potentional, but I'm not going to expect too much. In terms of animation, it is very simplistic and uninteresting for the most part. Maybe I'm a bit off on the animation, but it's hard to be impressed with much of anything after watching Paradise Kiss.<br />
<br />
What redeems this show a little bit for me is that it's about a figure skater. I really like the idea of this, because anime in general makes things turn out to be VERY beautiful and graceful. Watching Kaleido Star can really show you that. As great as Cirque du Soliel is, they cannot possibly do something as graceful and beautiful as Kaleido Star's shows. I was hoping for the same thing here.<br />
<br />
The sole skating in this felt mediocre, with the constant interruptions of the plane flying. And the whole angel inside her thing is a bit annoying, which takes the focus away from the portion of the show I really wanted to watch. I'll watch a few more episodes, but the odds are it will turn out very generic. I'll update when more episodes come out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-23-05, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ginga Densetsu WEED- B<br />
<br />
The show certainly is fun to watch. The animation is better than average. The story is straightforward. If I had to define this show, it would be a Shounen anime like Bleach, Naruto, etc. Except, all the main characters are dogs.<br />
<br />
So from the standpoint of a Shounen anime, it hits all marks well. It's not a bad shounen, but it's certainly no Naruto. Just very average. A big problem for me was relating to the characters. I cannot relate to dogs, obviously.<br />
<br />
It's a story about a group of dogs who fought to reclaim their land in the mountains of Japan, and won. Eventually, a monster came and took over their land, and a young pup was taken away to another place.<br />
<br />
It's easy to explain what will happen. The pup will grow up, become stronger (after all, he's got the blood of the Legendary dog that defeated the monstrous bear who took the land) and as he grows up, he'll eventually fight the monster and so on. It's a typical shounen story.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for something different, or to expand your experience of anime, it's a good show. I've already watched the earlier incarnation (not a prequel, it's a side story) so I didn't feel any need to watch more of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-23-05, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GPZ Cyber Formula Zero 01- B<br />
<br />
I planned to drop this because I realized it's a 1994 anime, so it's not new season. But It is Formula One racing, in 2017. Basically, about a 12 year old boy's racing career until he was 16 (which is where this series takes place). I was suprised by the speed of this episode, which had a time attack, full race, crash, hospital recovery, rehabilation, romance from beginning to marriage in a single 30 minute episode. Looks like the cars are not the only thing fast in ths show.<br />
<br />
I found it fun to watch, suprisingly. I can tell I've missed a lot of backstory. But I don't mind, it was a interesting show to experience, but I wouldn't watch more. It appears there are quite a few OVA's for this series, so if you are interested in F1 Racing, you may want to check this out. Just from this episode alone and the comments, I can tell it's probably a very touching series. The animation is great for it's time.</div></div><hr />

To Heart 2 - B<br />
<br />
It felt like your typical bishoujo anime. I still liked the first series better. The girl is cute, but the subs I had were bad. I didn't enjoy it very much as a result. But the messages got across, distractions aside.<br />
<br />
The girls are very typical for bishoujo games. The first character introduced is the stereotypical &quot;little sister-like childhood friend&quot; that you've grown up with, slept together with, and never realized she had tits until she tells you she has them.<br />
<br />
Nothing new introduced with the first episode. I'll watch some more because I liked the first series, and want to be sure that it won't get much better first. Not expecting too much with this, but it hits all the marks for a bishoujo anime, thus the grade, even if it's generic.<br />
<br />
What is angel heart about??<br />
<br />
A spin off or sequel to City Hunter, so they say. An assassin commits suicide, gets revived by the mafia, using the heart of another guy's wife and partner.</div></div><hr />

I LOVE THIS SERIES!  I got so tired of waiting for them to release it I went and found torrents for all 51 Episodes + the OAV.  Watched from episode ... uh. 27 I think it was, the one right after the first box set ends.  All the way to 52 (52 being the oav) in the same night.  I cant recomend this series enough for those that love 'cute' anime.<br />
<br />
Ill check out Animal Yokocho, you make it sound intresting.<br />
As for Aria, I heard through other sources that it wasnt going to be much of an anime unless your a fan of the manga.  And I havent read the manga (Dont read a whole lot of manga as compared to my anime viewing actually about 1:30 ratio)<br />
Black Cat only sounded intresting because of the &quot;Its like a dark Lupin the IIIrd&quot; comment.  Lupin is another of the series I watch all of.  But the rest of the comments on it kind of turned me off of the series.  I love asian horror but this just sounds odd so im not sure.<br />
Blood+ sounds intresting, I read a review on it on Anime News Network as well.  I may end up getting this one.<br />
Jigoku Shoujo, Because you suggested it ill give it a shot.  Sounds like an intresting concept but at first thought I dont have much faith in them keeping it intresting.  If they do keep it intresting it could be great.  Like Vampire Princess Miyu is a good one that could have been bad.  Gankutsuou and Le Portrait de Petite Cossette ive been real hesitant to buy yet.  Havent heard much of anything about them yet, though honestly I havent looked anything up yet.<br />
Angel Heart is a spinoff of City Hunter!  Gotta get that one. :b<br />
<br />
BTW - Keep up the good work on the review posts.  Ive read them all and taken to a few new series because of it. :D  I never got to much into Torrented anime, and lately ive only been focusing on a few series not wanting to download ones that I know nothing about.  Some may call me odd but ive been download series that ive started watching because I bought them just so I could watch the rest of the series uninterrupted, then watching it all again as the DVD's come in finally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This actually sounds reasonable. The anime is not as good of an introduction, at least so far, as the manga is. It's almost as if it expectes you to know the series already. I do highly recommend the manga, it is very... I guess you could say happy. It's more of a &quot;spiritual happiness&quot; than emotional. Ya know, like, being one with nature, that kind of thing.<br />
<br />

If they do keep it intresting it could be great. Like Vampire Princess Miyu is a good one that could have been bad. Gankutsuou and Le Portrait de Petite Cossette ive been real hesitant to buy yet. Havent heard much of anything about them yet, though honestly I havent looked anything up yet.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I am hoping for the best with this series, myself. It really could be an incredible series. But there's just so much room for failure. Hopefully, it becomes as amazing as I hope it to be.<br />
<br />
Gankutsuou is amazing, I really, really, really recommend it. I've read a few adaptations of The Count of Monte Cristo, but this show really ranks up there. It's an adaptaion that ONLY anime can do. I guess, you could say, in a sense that this series redeems the fact that &quot;Anime&quot; should exist as an viable Art form. May or may not like the series itself, but it's brilliance can not be denied.<br />
<br />
Le Portrait de Petit Cossette, well. I'm biased. Should be obvious based on my preferences. But, it's a abstract visual feast, if you're into that. The story is heavy, and it DOES require thinking. It's not one of those series where they give you half the information, you have to make up the other half. They give you all the information, and it takes ALOT of thinking to put all the pieces together. So it's a pretty strong story, if quite incoherent.<br />
<br />
I watch a lot of fansubs, but I feel justified in it because I consider it the same as watching it on TV before buying. And *looks at the one and half wall coverd with anime* I do buy a little. Just a teeny bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cluster Edge D-<br />
<br />
I can suspense my disbelief more than most. But when cars can fly off a cliff and take no damage, fly off a canyon to fall 50 feet and hit a steel boat and bounce 50 feet back up onto the other side of the canyon which must be over 500 feet apart, people know others need help carrying things around when they weren't told about it in obscure places for no particular reason, only in the first 10 minutes or less of an episode, I freak out.<br />
<br />
This. Show. Is. The. Suck. The only thing keeping it from a F is the fact it's animation is actually decent.<br />
<br />
Shakugan no SHANA B<br />
<br />
This show went up in grade with the second episode. It went into more detail, but I am still a bit confused on the matter. and it was pretty brutal, despite the fact the character is minor, and unexpected. That's pretty much what stunned me. Shows that can do that always impress me. The spoiler above goes into detail of the first two episodes, they are spoilers, but they might help you deciede to pick up the series or not if you can stand only two episodes being spoiled for you. Read at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't really understand what went on. Apparently, Guze no Tomogara ate many people in the world, and they became torches. Subordinates of Guze no Tomogara go out to collect the torches. Some people survived, others didn't. They became torches to minimize the effects it would have on the world. Eventually, the torch burns out and they disappear.<br />
<br />
I don't really understand this. Why would Guze no Tomogara care if people panic, enough to replace them with containers? Why do the containers need to be collected after being eaten? They need to lessen the shock - to what? Why are some people alive, and others already dead?<br />
<br />
If others have any insight into this, I would like some help understanding. There's a lot that doesn't seem to make sense. I understand it in my head, but I don't understand why any of it is neccessary.<br />
<br />
Aria the Animation A+<br />
<br />
I still enjoy the show. The first half of the show was probably the best explaination so far as to why I am truly in love with the series. A city that halts during an flood that happens occassionally, and Akari's feelings for life. <br />
<br />
Akari -&quot;If you do something different from the norm, on a day that's different from the norm, you might make a new discovery!<br />
<br />
And she made a new discovery. I can't emphasize enough how much I love this series. It's just so peaceful and warm that I can't help but feel happy when I watch it. The second half was not as peaceful, though.<br />
<br />
Solty Rei B-<br />
<br />
So far, in this first episode, the series is above average at best. The characters are very cliche. Come to think of it, the whole show is pretty much one big fat cliche. But, some may like it this way. The main character is a broken old bounty hunter (who's pretty good at his job, so the series seems to imply).<br />
<br />
The world had some tragedy that killed tens of thousands, and something that looks like an aurora in the sky that people can't go past. One day, a mysterious girl saves him by accident, and he takes her home. After following him around, he gets ambushed by the partner of the person he captured earlier in the episode. The girl turns out to be super strong and super indestructable, and easily throws a 100 foot tall steel security machine thousands of feet in the air into the aurora.<br />
<br />
I can't really say what I think it is simlar to. I know it is similar to something, I just don't remember it. This is another series that will need a few more episodes before I can make a final judgement.<br />
<br />
Mushishi A-<br />
<br />
Another suprise series. I'll start with explaining what Mushi is. (This is taken from the series itself:<br />
<br />
&quot;In simple terms... (my note: take out your hand and spread your fingers out) Let's say these four fingers are animals and the thumb is plants. People would be here. (my note: your middle finger, I'm not tryig to be funny here.) It would mean they're furthest away from the center, the heart.<br />
<br />
The closer you get to your palm, the lower the creature gets. If you follow the lines, the vessels become one around the wrist, right? The ones here are bacteria and microbes. When going this far, it's tough telling the difference between plants and animals. But there are still things past that. As you go through the arm, and past the shoulder and probably, the ones around here (my note: at the heart) are Mushi, otherwise known as Midori Mono. They are close to life itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mushishi are those who collect Mushi. Based on the first episode alone, I get a lot of feelings of Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke and several other Ghibli films. As of the first episode, it seems to be one of the better anime of the season. Here is another series that could go either way- incredible or horrible.<br />
<br />
The first episode, however, is very promising. I highly recommend it if you are looking for something unique. I can't promise anything for the whole series, however. I'll update some more as more episodes get translated.<br />
<br />
If anyone has anything to say about any series, personal reviews, or whatever, please go ahead. The only thing I ask is to stick to series that have been fansubbed, so that those who do not keep up with raws don't get confused. (I know I'm not the only one who watches things raw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-24-05, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Black Cat B-<br />
<br />
The series went up in rank over the next two episodes. I have a better idea of what the story will be. Right now, a few of the characters are bounty hunters, and the main character is a dog of some organization. <br />
<br />
The character style reminds me a bit of The King of Bandits, Jing. Which is not a bad thing, at all. It doesn't look like it has any long-running story right now. The series is very cheesy, and isn't ashamed of it. Some of the events have made me laugh quite a bit by how pointless the characters feel what they are doing is. Like, climbing 200 feet up a cliff only to find everyone's already wiped out. Halfway through the climb, they said something like, &quot;I have a feeling this will be pretty pointless&quot;.<br />
<br />
The direction of the story seems pretty clear. The government dog probably will join the bounty hunters and they will go around ending evils. The bad guys are stereotypical (a gangster turned mayor's last name was Tyrant! not the Resident Evil one, the actual word, tyrant. And he was a tyrant. How much more obvious does it get?)<br />
<br />
I actually enjoyed how cheesy the series is. So the grade went up to above average. It's still very iffy, could take a big turn for the worse, but if it stays consistent, it'll probably stay above average for the duration of the series. This will be my last update on the series unless something major happens to make it better or worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-24-05, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shakugan no SHANA B-<br />
<br />
With the third episode, the series went down a bit overall. I am starting to like Shana more now that she has been developed a bit. But, the whole story really seems dumb. I hoped the action in it would redeem it (nothing like beautiful girls like Shana wielding katanas) but the action is subpar.<br />
<br />
Chances are, I'll be dropping this series after the fourth episode. It feels like they are telling me the sky is purple, and when I ask why, the answer is, &quot;it just is, okay?&quot; That feels very annoying. If it doesn't redeem itself the next episode, I won't watch more unless someone mentions it gets better.<br />
<br />
Blood+ B+<br />
<br />
The show continues to be above average. They went into the story well. One thing I was happy to see is that they told Saya about her so fast, rather than keeping her in the dark. The show seems pretty brutal and realistic in an odd way. The fact that they involved funerals, political debates, and the like are a plus, compared to most series that just seem to have the whole world not realize whats going on.<br />
<br />
I would give this my recommendation if you like girls with katanas and the whole monsters vs humans aspect. I'm not going to review this series any more because it most likely will become too spoilerific later on. Already too many spoilers in this episode alone. But if something changes, I'll probably mention it.<br />
<br />
Legend of the Condor Hero just ended on fansubs. It's a good time to pick up a excellent series based on a famous book.It's old style martial arts that takes place in Asia.<br />
<br />
Kodocha is being released on DVD now, on it's third volume. Good time as any to start collecting this 100+ episode series before it becomes too daunting a task. Funimation is giving this the royal treatment, so look forward to it.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to pick up the lastest classics you can enjoy with your children, Pom Poko, and My Neighbors the Yamadas.</div></div><hr />

Since I don't like the fact that Media Factory is barging into the R1 business, and Aria is an excellent series, I will link to it here.<br />
<br />
http://tracker.crystalnova.net/<br />
<br />
You can find the first two episodes here. I doubt Aria will be licensed given the horrible market conditions right now, and the fact Aria the Manga got pulled even when the manga industry is booming still.<br />
<br />
As for Paradise Kiss's animation style, after watching Gankutsuou I don't think anything could possibly faze me in terms of animation, heh. The first two episodes were like watching 20 minutes of seizurebot. After I got used to it, it was excellent.<br />
<br />
[edit] If you like Aria and it does get licensed, please support the release.. It's titles like Aria where your money counts. They won't hear your money when you buy highly marketable titles, but they will in series like this. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It could get really good, or really bad. The series revolves around Go-Kart racing. This gave me a little bit of nostaliga, as I spent ~6 years working on go-karts and driving them for my best friend who was #1 in the state for 4 years in a row at the time.<br />
<br />
Personal ancedotes aside, my first impression is that the art is very iffy. It is decent, not horrible or great. The character designs are unusual. I don't like the go kart racings, though. It looks way too fake to me. The drivers look like little aliens instead of little kids. <br />
<br />
The story seems like a basic set-up. A kid is left alone all the time by his parent, and he takes care of himself very well at 10 years old living on his own. He resents that his father can't see him, and his father feels the same. While on a job, his father sees go-kart racers the same age as his son. He can't afford to buy a go-kart, so he deciedes to build one for Capeta (his son).<br />
<br />
Not much is revealed other than some explaination of Capeta's personality. I think the downfall of this series is going to be in the fact that the racing will be dull, if it's anything like what we saw in the first episode. There's also very little, if none at all, sense of speed. I don't really recommend this unless you are just curious about a go-kart racing anime, but I will watch a few more before decieding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Man, I feel a little bad now. I should have mentioned that ADV halted Aria at volume 3. I read the Japanese Aria, not the translated one. It's currently on volume 7. I think that ADV will resume it, however, as I hear they only stopped it so that the Japanese version can get ahead a bit before they catch up.<br />
<br />
But, it's not like Aria has any story to &quot;wrap up&quot; and end, so you won't feel like you dont have any closure, so I still recommend it even if they drop it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The grade stays the same for this second episode. It is just as good as the first.  I am really impressed that the animation got even better than the last one, but I liked the rough first episode animation a little better, honestly. It made it look more visually interesting.<br />
<br />
The story progresses further, and a lot of things make more sense now. Also some hinting of a bigger story going on. The story seems to be interesting, and the action scenes were very good. Sometimes it is disorienting due to the &quot;camera angle&quot; but it's fast and animated.<br />
<br />
It appears that there are several dimensions in a &quot;Time-Space&quot; sort of thing, and a group's dimension is in danger due to an, I suppose, &quot;evil&quot; empire destroying it. They need a torque from another dimension to be able to fight back to those who are trying to destroy their dimension. <br />
<br />
One problem I have is that all the people in capes feel as though they have the same personality. All of them are serious, intense, and gernerlly always pissed off for no particular reason.<br />
<br />
I think that this will be a good story when developed more and all the characters become more unique.</div></div><hr />

I liked this show a bit. The premise is interesting. An professional Assassin known as Glass Heart had done fifty assassinations in one day. She killed herself over guilt by jumping off a building, but a heart transplant saved her. <br />

While in a coma, she refused to wake up. The person who's heart got transpanted into her, Karoi, seems to &quot;live&quot; inside her now and convinces her to live on. Glass Heart has inherited Kaori's memories, it seems. The story is pretty much set up, I have no idea where it is going from here.<br />

I'm sorry, is that a spoiler for the other series this is based on? I'm not sure if I should put it in tags. I haven't seen the other series.<br />

And yes, she's dead in the first episode. It seems like it's something that happened this episode, not a continuation of something that happened in another series. If you want me to explain it (even though it was shown in the first like.. five minutes of the episode heh) click on the spoiler tags.<br />
<br />
She went to see the guy she was going out with, Ryo, to get a commerative wedding picture. While on the way there, someone appears to have walked in front of a truck, Kaori jumped to push her out of the way and got hit by the oncoming truck.<br />

Spoilers dont bother me to much, I just dont remember this happening in the series?  Gonna have to research that.  <br />
What bothers me most about it is that that means theres probably some episodes out there I dont have. :angry<br />
<br />
Edit<br />
Ok, Did some research and nothing to fear about something in the past spoiling.<br />
&quot;City Hunter story ends when Ryo finally told Kaori his fellings ( they have been falling in love since their first meeting ). A romantic ending. But, will they finally get married?&quot;<br />
Kaori was alive when the series ended its manga run in '92.  Kaori coming to her 'current events' in Angel Heart is the bases for the series it seems.  The first time it is ever mentioned is when its mentioned in Angel Heart. There is also no mention until the new series about the /event/ wedding between them that was about to happen when her 'current status' happened.<br />
Whew, was begining to think I was slacking there and missed something. :b  <br />

I thought it was a little cute, but the story just moves at a blazing fast speed. Plot development that usually takes most anime 5 episodes, in one episode. I got a bit dizzy, I think. The show pretty much is similar to your typical bishoujo anime. Guy with many girls. A lot of little sister complex fanservice in the first episode.<br />
<br />
But, it felt very... odd. Like the reason why the girl didn't like red. It just felt shallow and 2D, even for a bishoujo anime where 2D girls are penny a dozen. Doesn't seem great, but it's not bad either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would have to give it a B to B+ after the first esp...Ya the little sister complex is kinda disturbing but after what happened etc. think ya can understand somewhat....<br />
<br />
As for the red well has to do with parents death really...that kinda event at a young age is pretty traumatic so seeing the red is what triggers it....<br />
<br />
But overall it is pretty average tho but like ya said its not too bad but prob not the best either....</div></div><hr />

The creator, Tsukasa Hojo, when he started doing the Angel Heart manga, stated that there is no firm connection between Angel Heart and City Hunter.  It's best just to look at it as an alternate story, and not worry about continuity with City Hunter.</div></div><hr />

This 40 minute OVA is very, very touching. The premise is how two young kids in the distant future meet each other. One is a girl who has a sickness where she forgets her memories. The other is a boy who is a robot being implanted with the memories of a boy who died, as a replacement for their lost son.<br />
<br />
By coincidence, they meet. After a while, they become friends despite being complete opposites, one gaining unwanted memories, the other losing wanted memories.<br />
<br />
It is a really amazing story for only 40 minutes. It could easily have become a whole season's story, but to cram it in 40 minutes is really incredible.<br />
<br />
I really loved the interactions between the two, how they seemed sometimes childlike and immature. Other times, they really felt so hopeless and depressing. The way they helped each other, and some insight onto the future technology, was really amazing.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this OVA. It's really too bad it's not a full season.<br />

It went up a bit, after watching episodes 2-4. The story felt more like a bishoujo anime than it did with the first, so I felt I could review it as such. The way they deal with one girl per episode is pretty standard. I liked how two of the girls had clear conclusions, if lacking in story, rather than leaving it until the end to &quot;pick&quot; the girl. It appears the competition will be between the PE teacher and the little sister.<br />
<br />
I'm still annoyed about how shallow the show is. They present everyone so 2D that I can't feel any attatchment to any of the characters. All their problems and ways of dealing with it is so common and stupid. The whole red thing still annoys me. I do understand the reasoning, but it's the reasoning I find lacking.<br />
<br />
But, when weighted against other Bishoujo anime, it is slightly above average. It almost feels like a Da Capo clone (Hello, Nemu v.2) without the whole magical element.<br />
<br />
I'm proabably going to watch some more. If you liked Da Capo and didn't get turned off by the whole insect aspect, then you'll be able to stomach this just fine. It's no To Heart or Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, though. It's really as easy a decision as, if you like Da Capo, you'll like this, if you don't know Da Capo, but like Bishoujo, watch the first episode and see if you like the style. It pretty much sets the pace for the whole show so far so it's a good demo of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno then hehe but I can see maybe reacting to blood as a trigger but just to red in general is weird....but the reaction ppl have to tragic events are different sometimes....<br />
<br />
As for To heart (the first one), its too bad none try to get it anymore :( the seeding for it is very poor it seems :(....</div></div><hr />

Yes, there's no connection between the two. I think maybe the school is the same, though. I'd have to dig up the outfits, but I think the HIgh School uniform is the same for both series.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This show went up a bit after watching the next two episodes. I didn't feel it much in the first episode, but there's a strong resemblance to Cowboy Bebop in the next two episodes. The whole bounty hunting thing, the main character's personality, etc.<br />
<br />
The story seems interesting so far, which I like. One thing I really like is, they are talking about the Blast Fall that occured which killed thousands. In the opening of the second and third episodes, they had random characters talking about their experiences, where they were, etc during the Blast Fall. It gives a sense of realism to it, if I can define it as that.<br />
<br />
The action sequences are pretty good. There seems to be a couple large stories running through right now, the most obvious revolving around Solty herself, and the other being the Blast Fall. I really like how the criminals were talking about the main char's reputation, it made hims seem to be very hardcore.<br />
<br />
It seems like a good show for those who like Full Metal Panic!, Cowboy Bebop, and Ghost in the Shell. One thing that freaks me out is Solty's ears. *shiver* I absolutely adore Kasha! She's so cute! The way she bosses around her mom is great, haha. I also loved the part where she taught Solty how to eat a hamburger. Moe~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, well. I'm biased because I played the game, so To Heart anime had a stronger impact on me because I had the game to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; so to speak. As far as the anime goes, I suppose I liked the characters better. Not to imply that Konomi isn't cute, but I'll still have to meet the rest of the cast before decieding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to be your typical mahou shoujo show. It's based on the seven Gods of Luck. Their female incarnations thousands of years in the future, I guess. One of my problems with this show is I cannot identify it well. This may be because I don't watch very much Mahou Shoujo (relative to the amount that exists).<br />
<br />
On one hand, I fet the feel it's a lolicon Mahou Shoujo like how Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha's was. Whether that's a plus or a negative, really depends on the viewer. While there wasn't much to point to that direction, there were some undertones that I noticed. At the very least, it's more balant than PRetty Cure is, and people go nutso over it.<br />
<br />
Content-wise, the story seems pretty standard for a mahou shoujo. Seven girls who are to save the world from the great evil that is incoming. The colors are bright and happy, the girls are cute, and they've got lolita twins that implicate twincest. Again, your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
With my limited experience in mahou shoujo, I'd say try it if you like mahou shoujo. If you don't, there's better shows to try instead of this one. When the story and content have a more clear direction, I'll probably base my final decision on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">11-06-05, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haven't done an update in a while, so here goes. Some new series too.<br />
<br />
Aria the Animation A-<br />
<br />
The series continues to be good, but it has a huge flaw over the manga. In the anime, you don't have as much insight into what Akari is thinking, where the manga pretty much revolves around it. This makes it difficult to express the beauty in the surroundings.<br />
<br />
That said, it's still retains everyone's personality well, I think. The story is beautiful and warm. I'm sure I will really enjoy the series, although I'm at an advantage having been able to read the mangas, so I can easily fill in the blanks.<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend this show. Final update on this series.<br />
<br />
Capeta C+<br />
<br />
The show is walking a fine line between crap and good. At times, I really dislike it, other times, I really like it. If the story maintained the pace now, I probably would have dropped it with this second episode. But the opening promises a older Capeta, looks like in his mid-teens, so that gives me more reason to watch it. I'm still not very certain, however. <br />
<br />
The story still revolves around go-kart, where his father assembled a go=kart out of trash for him. It's a pretty interesting story, so far.<br />
<br />
Mushishi A+ (super-duper-high recommendation)<br />
<br />
The animation is incredible. The character designs are wonderful. The story is, completely engaging at worst. If it maintains this pace, you're looking at one of the best anime of the year. At 26 episodes, there's a lot of room for error in a show like this, but it's such a incredible two episodes that I am stunned.<br />
<br />
The story seems to be episodic with a running theme. This time, a girl loses her sight. Mushi are responsible for it. The Mushishi comes to heal her. I have to say, the way the artist draws girls are very sweet. The first episode had a really cute girl, this one was very mysterious and beautiful.<br />
<br />
The story is amazing. I strongly recommend this to anyone.<br />
<br />
Paradise Kiss A+<br />
<br />
With the third episode, I am still in awe of the show. The character designs have grown on to me very well. I really like how fast this show is going, no beating around the bush. EP. 3 spoilers below:<br />
<br />
How discovered her attraction to George and got their relationship going in only 10 minutes, and their honesty towards each other, is amazing. Definitely a big plus in my book<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend this show to the crowd who like more adult drama.<br />
<br />
Rozen Maiden ~Traumend~ A<br />
<br />
Warning: extreme bias contained within...<br />
<br />
Man, the opening is wonderful, Suseiseki and Souseiseki scene was sooooo great. All the dolls are as cute as always. Shinku is very pretty as usual. I really like everyone's attitudes and childishness, and Shinku's childish maturity. It's really wonderful to watch.<br />
<br />
That side, the story was even more fascinating than the first season. The rabbit is mysterious, and Shinku's reflection on Suigentou in her dreams is really harsh. It gives you a feel of the sadness Shinku is enduring, and makes you depressed at how Suigentou is feeling. <br />
<br />
A new doll is introduced! That's exciting news, to say the least. The eyepatch gives her a interesting look, despite being similar to Suigentou. If you havent seen Rozen Maiden the original series, then watch it before watching this one. If you have seen Rozen Maiden, this series is a no-brainer.<br />
<br />
KarinB-<br />
<br />
Oh man, I couldn't stop laughing at the end of this episode. The story goes from mysterious, stupid, comedic, out of this world, and serious so randomly. And for gods sake, a blood-giving vampire?! That's just too much. I really was cracking up at the whole premise of this series. It's really very average, school drama with a twist. If you like school dramas, you'll probably like this show. At least so far as the first episode is concerned.<br />
<br />
Usui's constant glare is funny, it really thows everyone (the characters and audience) off. It has potentional to be a decent school drama, but it seems like a one joke pony to me right now. Although, the nosebleed scene at the end was so ******* hilarious that I'd almost recommed people to watch the episode just for that. I've seen women nosebleeds (FLCL) and I've seen some bad nosebleeds from men, but this takes the cake. A woman nosebleed that looks like a scene out of a massacare. Blood every ******* where. It's just that awesome, haha.<br />
<br />
Jigoku Shoujo A<br />
<br />
I still like the animation which is very cool. I am reminded of Le Portrait de Petite Cossette. I like this second episode because it shows something that was lacking in the last one - regret. I still can't comprehend why they would go to hell for what they've endured. It just doesn't seem worth it. An eternity vs 1 year?<br />
<br />
But, that exactly is why I liked this episode. As I said, regret. I'm hoping the show goes further into this concept, which would round it out well in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Well that's all folks. That leaves the following:<br />
<br />
Idaten Jump<br />
Fighting Beauty Wulong<br />
Akagi<br />
Gun Parade Orchestra<br />
Kotenco Tenco<br />
Lamune<br />

<br />
I thought it was a little cute, but the story just moves at a blazing fast speed. Plot development that usually takes most anime 5 episodes, in one episode. I got a bit dizzy, I think. The show pretty much is similar to your typical bishoujo anime. Guy with many girls. A lot of little sister complex fanservice in the first episode.<br />
<br />
But, it felt very... odd. Like the reason why the girl didn't like red. It just felt shallow and 2D, even for a bishoujo anime where 2D girls are penny a dozen. Doesn't seem great, but it's not bad either.<br />
<br />
Hehe still not too bad of a show :P...the Opening is still nice hehe even tho the start of it kinda sounds like a gundom wing opening... :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">11-07-05, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact I am a Bishoujo fan is more or less the only reason why I am still watching Canvas right now. I like the episodic feel of it because most bishoujo anime with a running story that they focus on usually suck, because it's like, hurry up! Get it over with! And ends up feeling more like a harem than a bishoujo game.<br />
<br />
Of course, there are exceptions (Kimi ga Nozomu Eien) which is really great.<br />
<br />
While I'm here, I suppose I may as well do some more in-depth reviews.<br />
<br />
To Heart 2 B+<br />
<br />
Episode 2. Konomi's designs really is growing on me. I love how cute she is. Although the introduction of Tamaki doesn't have a postive effect on me. I think the animators used the same face for her the whole episode. Such a monotonous face, a big contrast from Konomi who is always very expressive.<br />
<br />
The story is still very, how do I say? &quot;well paced&quot; I suppose. Not too slow, not too fast, so it's rather nice to watch. I'll probably watch a bit more.<br />
<br />
Lamune B-<br />
<br />
The show seems a bit dull, there's no real sense of direction in the first episode. It introduces only one girl (main girl, I'm sure, but very little hint of others). And one guy. The whole first episode centered around those two, which gave me a sense of... desolation, I guess. Like there was nothing else in the world. Maybe they were aiming for that feel, but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
What redeemed this show was the &quot;back and forth&quot; between Nanami and Ken. I thought it was rather cute how they interacted with each other. Ken's picking on her was rather mischeavous and Nanami's reactions were fun to watch. Their openess with each other is also a decent plus. A strong male lead really does make for a good foundation of this type of anime, at least from my perspective.<br />
<br />
It's above average and could be pretty good.<br />
<br />
Capeta C+<br />
<br />
It's still between good and bad. I have too many other shows to watch, so I've decieded to drop it with the third episode watched.<br />
<br />
The third episode was rather consistent with the other two. If you're a sports anime fan, you might like this one. I was mistaken about being a teenage go-kart racer for what it's worth. The opening actually implys he will be a ADULT F-1 racer. That would make this anime rather good. However, I doubt it will make it that far.<br />
<br />
If it does, I might pick it up again.<br />
<br />
Mushishi A+<br />
<br />
With the third episode, I have to say I am absolutely in love with it and will be picking up the manga series as a result. No cute girls this time (a little disappointed, I guess, but it's a bonus not a neccessity). The story is still going very strong, I can't really say anything without spoilers, other than this has a HIGH recommendation for me for anyone. The third episode is fascinating and shows an actual process in solving a problem with a village affected by Mushi.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy it a hell of a lot. If you haven't picked it up and you are a general anime watcher (i.e. you watch anything that's good, rather than sticking in one genre) then you MUST watch this.</div></div><hr />

Ummm ya so....I think she(Konomi) is way cuter than anyone, even those in canvas 2 :D :P. Overall have to agree its pretty decent but it is just one of those nice ones to watch.<br />

To Heart 2 - B<br />
<br />
<br />
The girls are very typical for bishoujo games. The first character introduced is the stereotypical &quot;little sister-like childhood friend&quot; that you've grown up with, slept together with, and never realized she had tits until she tells you she has them.<br />

<br />
Mushishi A-<br />
<br />
Another suprise series. I'll start with explaining what Mushi is. (This is taken from the series itself:<br />
<br />
&quot;In simple terms... (my note: take out your hand and spread your fingers out) Let's say these four fingers are animals and the thumb is plants. People would be here. (my note: your middle finger, I'm not tryig to be funny here.) It would mean they're furthest away from the center, the heart.<br />
<br />
The closer you get to your palm, the lower the creature gets. If you follow the lines, the vessels become one around the wrist, right? The ones here are bacteria and microbes. When going this far, it's tough telling the difference between plants and animals. But there are still things past that. As you go through the arm, and past the shoulder and probably, the ones around here (my note: at the heart) are Mushi, otherwise known as Midori Mono. They are close to life itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mushishi are those who collect Mushi. Based on the first episode alone, I get a lot of feelings of Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke and several other Ghibli films. As of the first episode, it seems to be one of the better anime of the season. Here is another series that could go either way- incredible or horrible.<br />
<br />
The first episode, however, is very promising. I highly recommend it if you are looking for something unique. I can't promise anything for the whole series, however. I'll update some more as more episodes get translated.<br />
<br />
If anyone has anything to say about any series, personal reviews, or whatever, please go ahead. The only thing I ask is to stick to series that have been fansubbed, so that those who do not keep up with raws don't get confused. (I know I'm not the only one who watches things raw)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you're asking what the series is, or what a Mushi is, but the whole quote answers both questions.<br />
<br />
In any case, if I have not mentioned it yet, this is my favorite show of the season. I'm completely capativated and in love.</div></div><hr />

The main lead is a pretty cool guy, not some whining perverted asshat, and the girls aren't in that 'love you but can't show it' cliche. Love Hina, this is not. The opening theme rocks, too.<br />
 <br />
And Asa is my favorite. ^^<br />
<br />
Well it wasn't too bad for a first esp i guess hehe. But wow dang thats a lot of fanservice lol. Opening theme is really nice tho :P. The animation they used also is very nice...but i guess thats normal :P.</div></div><hr />

on the plus side i got the first 6 eps of Solty Rei, watched the first so far. I really like the atmosphere, it reminds me of FFVIII. Good stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, only the second episode has been released. It's still ok so far. I still feel that it has great potentional depending on how they do the story from here out, but it has just as much of a chance as sucking badly.<br />
<br />
That aside, Aria the Animation is still impressing me. With the fifth episode released, it's one of my favorites. When I thought about it a bit, I realized what was missing from the TV series compared to the manga. In the manga, we got to see Akira's narrations (of her thoughts). So it made things not noticeable become wonderful little things.<br />
<br />
The fifth episode was the best representation of this. We got to see Akira's feelings and everything that makes her so wonderful that we've been able to see in her all along in the manga. I am in love with Akira! This and Mushishi both get my best recommendations so far for the season.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i am going to have to agree. Roy seems like a character with a lot of potential but the entire show is clouded over by stupidity from the solty character. the attemps to make it semi-serious with all her wonderful gifts and the RUC just add insult to injury.<br />
<br />
if anything, it makes me want to watch Cowboy Bebop again so that I can remember what a good anime is all about.</div></div><hr />

The atmosphere for the episodes is incredible, and sets a mood for the whole episode. I'll probably try to keep up with it.</div></div><hr />

Episode four is in-*******-credible. To think it got the whole &quot;saving&quot; people so well, that it could also throw KO punches without holding back either. Man, it was so sad and yet so wonderful.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, episode two was one of the most stunning events, like, ever. So out of the blue, and despite only knowing the character (avoiding spiolers here) it really crushed you.<br />

KimiNozo really hurt.</div></div><hr />

Takayuki must die though. It should have gone with a better ending - hot yuri between Haruka and Mitsuki with an Akane bonus and Takayuki getting hit by a truck.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I was laughing my ass off at the subtle /nod to people who wanted Takayuki dead in one of the last episodes (not sure which) where it looked like Bakayuki got hit by a car. Bastards, I was disappointed he wasn't.</div></div><hr />

I was always scared to open up<br />
I didn't want to show my face, And always looked down.<br />
I always closed off...My fearful heart.<br />
I sadly traced....My deep scars.<br />
The seassons flow by and my heart melts.<br />
I'll learn to accept the pain of that day.<br />
Since I realized that we all carry a weight on our shoulders..Warm feelings began to grow.<br />
This sadness will someday become kindness.<br />
A breeze blows on the hill where I met you.<br />
<br />
I'll never forget that trembling look..<br />
I feel lost and anxious..while im happily in love.<br />
I'll never forget this earnest feeling.<br />
Thank you for fascinating me, Im sorry....<br />
The seasons are revolving, so are my feelings..<br />
I believe that everyone will smile tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Every day I send my feelings of happiness..<br />
I embrace serenity and want to go on living.<br />
This sadness will surely someday become affection..<br />
Crying is ok, becasue it softly uplifts us..<br />
<br />
How quietly the days are going by..have my feelings become unnoticed?...<br />
Everyone walking is holding back..their tears..<br />
It wraps the world in warmth..<br />

The sadness will surely someday become affection..<br />

Haven't been watching much lately (taking care of cat). But since I'm here...<br />
<br />
Episode 16 of SHUFFLE! &quot;But remember, Rin... Heaven allows polygamy&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh shizzle. <br />
<br />
Oh, Fate//Stay Night's promo came out! I'm absolutely orgasmatic. Saber *.*<br />
<br />
Pretty Cure episode 42 is absolutely wonderful. I don't know why I'm still watching Shakugan no Shana. Super Super Rune is cute. Finally, another Zipang episode. Ichigo Mashimaro is win. What the hell happened to Basilisk? T_T<br />
<br />
Mushishi, Aria the Animation, Rozen Maiden and Paradise Kiss are my favorites of the season. With Mushishi ranking #1 by ten thousand miles. Ha ha, I made a geek joke. But it's absolutely great in every definition of great. Very few series I have watched in the past can really compare, at least as far as the first 6 episodes go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty Cure has been topping the charts in Japan for quite a while. It's called the DBZ for girls. It's a fighting mahou shoujo anime.</div></div><hr />

They are similar to a extent, and might be a good indicator as to whether you'd like fate before you pick it up. It starts airing in winter.<br />
<br />
And what is ssj? A dbz reference? In any case, they do have super saiyan like powerups, magical girl style. (I.e. Accessories that power them up, cheesy transformation scenes and attacks.)<br />

K :). Ya ssj = super saiyan jin. The DBZ community uses that b/c its easier than typing all that :P. So its ssj then ssj2-4. Then you have USSJ (what trunks became that one time when fighting cell. He had buffed up body etc)..<br />
<br />
Anyway :P...<br />
<br />
Seeing SSJ for the first time was cool hehe. But something about kaio ken and its red aura that kicks ass....<br />
<br />
Lol that quote almost makes it sound like its sailor moon....:P</div></div><hr />

Yeah Len, I was dancing in joy :D<br />
<br />
I'm going to re-watch it when the DVD versions (gogo widescreen) come out.<br />
<br />
And Sollon, it is supposed to sound like Sailor Moon. It is a mahou shoujo after all, lol. In terms of story and interaction, it's like Sailor Moon (or any mahou shoujo out there, really) but in terms of combat and power ups, it's DBZ. (The director of Pretty Cure also, I believe, directed or had some part of working with DBZ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mushishi episode 7 was brillant again. Ginko's character development was well done and not forced. The story was fascinating and took advantage of our childhood nostalagia of finding the base of a rainbow.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one watching this?! Geez. Such an incredible series and very few people are watching it :(<br />
<br />
Shuffle 20 was a well done setup for the next episode. Someone's gonna snap soon. Some kaede nude service. Dammit rin, turn the lights on and let us have a nice long look willya?! Geez.<br />
<br />
I think rin is a ***** though. That was totally the wrong decision. Its not going to change anything if he does that.<br />
<br />
Seems our two princesses are out of the game now though. Kaede's probably out too. That leaves asa pretty much. Anyone wanna take our bets? Or does everyone else think its asa too? Hmm. Lets make it a little more competitive. Anyone think they will cop out the ending? Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">12-07-05, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Asa is plain awesome, and I applaud Rin's tastes. I been cheering her on since episode #1, never thought in a million years she's actually make the cut.<br />
 <br />
Tho him leaving is gonna push Lucy Kaede over the edge. She was pretty close allready, but methinks it's gonna be interesting to see her completely lose all reason for living.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Len, wanna bet on Sollon taking this comment back soon since he's behind? :D<br />
<br />
Lucy, eh? There's quite a resemblance now that you mention it, lol. In the beginning I liked Kaede a little bit, but her mindless devotion to Rin was a turnoff. It's no wonder she scared Rin away, but Rin should've dealt with it before leaving. It's not that I think he's a ***** for not picking Kaede, but for not fixing the situation.<br />
<br />
I do agree with his decision to go with Asa. I didn't like her too much in the beginning as she seemed like the 2D cook/abusive generic support cast. But that quickly changed, I think she's the best developed person in the series.<br />
<br />
I didn't like how they handled Sia. It felt like a cop-out. She had this second personality and what? It just disappeared. I know there was more. I never got around to playing her story in the game before returning it to the person I loaned it from, but it seemed like there should have been much more to it.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that all this is leading to a cop-out ending. Rin hasn't rejected the two princesses. It feels like they are just going to say something like, &quot;all the girls continue to pursue Rin happily ever after&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
Let's hope for the best.</div></div><hr />

I got tired of downloading part of a series then having it dropped in the middle so I tend to get the whole thing before I start watching anymore.  To many other things going to to watch them all. :(<br />
<br />
Though when we get this program sold and im making 6 figures next year I'll be dropping back to 20 hours a week at my real job just because I can.  Then I'll watch a lot of what I havent had time to watch before.</div></div><hr />
