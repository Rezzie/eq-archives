<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TribalGeek</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am not sure how cohernt this is going to be. I have had a few beers and am rather tired, but I need to just get this @#%$ out.<br />
<br />
For the 3 weeks or so my life has gotten turned upside down. I don't rember anything that happened to cause it I just know that it did. It might have been for weeks ago but I am not sure. I just know things are going wrong. <br />
<br />
I work from 4:30 to 1:00 a.m doing customer service for verizon wireless. The job sucks the hours suck the people suck the customers suck, but I keep going in because I need to pay my bills. I don't sleep much anymore I don't eat alot I usually grab a lunch not much even then and then a snack for dinner at work. I am constantly wore out during the day. I am starting to get sick. I feel like I have got the flu coming on. <br />
<br />
I am having more girl problems but these are looking like they might work out. I will go into them but not in great detail this time. Bassicly I like this hot punk chick. Hot punk chick has fiancee. They break up we nearly go out. They get back together. I am all torn up. They break up again and me and her are getting close to going out again. She has some depression problems family problems ex problems and has panic attacks. She dosen't want to go out with anyone untill she can get some of this worked out. She changed her medicine and then stopped this bacth because it had a sedative in it that knocked her out. I usually am up with her till 4 when she is at my friends house who lives in my apartment complex. I don't get much sleep and this is one of the reasons. She had a panic attack last night and wasn't able to wake me up. I finally woke up on my own and helped her out but barley since I kept nearly falling asleep every time I blinked.<br />
<br />
I am pretty close to depressed right now between that sitituation and hearing all my friends @#%$. My bro just broke up with his gf who is a friend of mine so I'll hear about that. My friends who live togther are fighting so I get both sides of that. My room mates co worker who is a friend hates one of her jobs so I hear about that. I hear about my parents troubles who are in marrige counsling now. <br />
<br />
I hate school with a passion. I hate my job my life is sucking pretty bad at this point because I keep hearing all my friends problems plus mine so I never see the upside to life. I don't really know why I posted other than the fact that I need to get that out. If you want to post advice feel free too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This girl has broken up with and gotten back together with her fiancee twice according to you.  You think your chances with her are good when she keeps going back to someone else?  heh.  Not to mention I would not be interested with someone with that much baggage and flaky relationship sense in the first place, but maybe that's me.<br />
<br />
Tell your friends and this chick you need a week to yourself, get rested, eat some good food and get over the flu.  Turn off your phone, leave voicemail/message machine on in case of emergency, and get rested up and more healthy. -- Formerly Squink McPoke</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aside from the girl troubles that sounds eerily familiar. First you need to get more sleep. Not sleeping enough for extended period will seriously @#%$ you up and I say this from vast experience of insomnia.<br />
<br />
Secondly, try to eat regularly. I don't know, maybe you don't have the appetite to (which, if you also can't sleep, may be indicative of a somewhat more serious problem) do that but try. Not eating enough and not sleeping enough is not a good combo at all. You really sound like you need a little vacation to rest up. A few days of &quot;STFU, I don't need to hear that @#%$ right now&quot; time. For me it's now: sleep &gt; health &gt; evrything else. Trust me when I say it's much better to take a few days now and tell those who object that you need it than being forced to take many more days later when everything's gotten totally @#%$ and everyone agrees that you do need the time.</div></div><hr />

I know I know, &quot;I don't have time,&quot; well make the time. It will not only help you sleep much better, it will do wonders for your mood.</div></div><hr />

Try to sleep more regularly, go for a walk everyday, eat better.  It's silly small things but if you do that for a week or so you'll start seing results and feel a bit better.<br />
<br />
Your health is the most important resource you have, if you can't cope with the way things are do something to change them even if that means asking for external help, but think of yourself first because others might not be thinking of what's best for you.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TribalGeek</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I try to eat more but I am at work so much at night dinner is near impossible till I get home. Lunch is usually fast food which isn't good. I had health food today from my friends work. I started playing ddr so thats helped a little with the exercise.<br />
<br />
The girl broke up with her fiance then got back togther and is broken up with him again at this time. The guy asked her to marry him but still planned on in sometime in the future seeing other people. <br />
<br />
I think however that I am gonna take that week off. I realy fell like I need to. HArd to have a normal sleep schedual when I work till 1 or 1:30 but I think I can get something worked out. I may crash at my parents since its quiter there.</div></div><hr />

Well, technically speaking I do wake up every morning in bed with a woman I mostly like who'll do anything I want her to and who'll be with me forever and never leave me - so no, no girl problems here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pedric Cuf</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As with Koru, this is also very familiar to me as well (minus the girl troubles. I had a wonderful one helping me out). First, you did the right thing about taking that week off. I don't know how your parents are, but if it's quieter there and they won't bother you, definitely go there. Take that week to try to put your life into perspective. First, DO NOT sleep all the time. For the first few days that will be fine, but if you're anything like me, if you do nothing but sleep, you'll fall into a deeper depression. Get up, do as Krimzan says and exercise. The endomorphins released this way work wonders. Put your life into perspective. Ask yourself why you're working yourself so hard and whether it's worth it at the expense of your health. Tell your parents some of your problems and ask them whether they would help to support you some more.<br />
<br />
Basically, when I was depressed, I didn't even know why I even continued to live other than I was too cowardly to commit suicide. Putting your life into perspective and finding a goal that YOU want to achieve works wonders.<br />
<br />
I'll try to take a crack at your girl problems, but I have no experience in this field and my advice is known to be flawed. First, it sounds to me as you do really like this girl. If this is the case, there is a lot of things you'll have to put up with if you want the relationship to suceed. If you find that there are too many problems in trying to keep up the relationship, I recommend just backing off. Give both of you some time. It sounds to me like she doesn't know what she wants. She probably cares a lot for you, but she also cares a lot for this guy she keeps breaking off with. I recommend telling her that you would like a week to yourself to &quot;find yourself&quot; as it is. I know some women who would take this as &quot;I'm not interested, go away&quot; but honestly, I don't think that that kind of woman is what you want. If she is unwilling to wait a week for you to get your bearings, what would your long term relationship be like? Or if she doesn't trust you to take that week to yourself, again, what would it be like?<br />
<br />
I agree with squink that if it does get involved, she'll be bringing a lot of emotional baggage and problems of her own. But IMO, that's what relationships are all about. And tell her about your own problems.<br />
<br />
Well, that's all the crackpot advice I can think of right now, and sorry for the incoherentness of it. Best of luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sleeping and eating correctly made more differences for me in College than you can belive.  If you get home 1-1:30, alway be in bed at 2:15.  Wake up at 9:30 and start whatever your schedule is at 10.  If this doesn't work with your classes?  juggle them.  It's better to take a lean semester and do good than to take too much and screw them all.  Set 3 times during the day to eat.  Then EAT then whether you are hungry or not.  keep soup, fruit, and stuff for sandwitches, (bread in the freezer, lunch meat, cheese, and mustard/miracle whip) on hand.  Always eat.  You don't have to keep the same schedule as everyone else but eating at say, 9:45, 3, and 9 will help stablize your body to a schedule.<br />
<br />
Ditch the chick.  She's bringing stress to your life right now.  Get your life working, THEN expand to other people's lives.<br />
<br />
YOu can do this but you can't just lay back and expect everything to work.  You have to set yourself a schedule and keep to it.<br />
<br />
Finally, find something you enjoy whether it's renting a movie and every other day, going to your schools dance club *cough*good choise*cough*, hiking/biking, Fencing, Playing dominoes, go to the weekly school comedian, whatever.  Find something you enjoy and do it at least once a week.  Never let anything interrupt it.  There is no hour of your discressionary time, (time your awake, not in class, and not at work), that you cannot always have to yourself.  If you need to study, plan ahead and study around that time.  Always keep it to yourself.<br />
<br />
You do these things, get your life back on a schedule and make sure the schedule includes the essentials:  food, sleep, relaxation, and you will be able to accomplish the trials.<br />

<br />
I love little punk girls and goth are kinda nice also   .  So sieze the opprotunity if you like her but yes short term you need a break from her soap opera life.<br />
<br />
But Pedric gave good advice take a step back from EVERYTHING.  A change of scenery may do you justice as well if thats an option (just getting away from the place where all these troubles exist for a short time will do wonders) <br />
<br />
Head outta town for a weekend if its an option.  Also put yourself first for awhile.  I dont hear to many problems about YOU but alot of everyones issue bogging you down.  Focus on yourself your bro,friends and co workers are all grown ups and can handle themselves and their issues.<br />
<br />
Also a spot of excercise will do wonders I lift and do situps for like 30-45 min 3 to 4 days a week and since I have started a noticeable drop in depression and a much improved outlook on life.  Yeah its hard to start but get a week or 2 in and you wont wanna stop.   Edited by: Jayan Thornfoot at: 10/8/03 10:43 am</div></div><hr />
