You are right, stealth is a weak right now.  It is a handicap more than anything. <br />
<br />
The huge speed penalty coupled with no form of Improved stealth (way to become invisible again to the enemy player *Smoke bomb is all but effective in this situation*).<br />
<br />
If someone spots you stealthed, you are better to unstealth right away and charge but most likely you are already getting nuked and almost dead.<br />
<br />
If you want to kill someone dont bother stealthing just shoot your bow and run towards them until you can get some melee hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  You dont know when someone can see you or not<br />
2.  You cant get stealth speed to higher stealth levels (duh).  Stealth I is too slow.</div></div><hr />

The speed would be fine if stealth actually worked. If it was similar to WoW's Stealth, we would be in business.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what you mean.  I have been questing (at lvl 12) in areas frequented by the enemy (great to slip a bit of pvp in once in a while) and have not been spotted (or, if they saw me, they ignored me...rare for a fg to do).<br />
<br />
Just this afternoon, I attacked and killed an equal level disciple and he told me he could not see me the entire fight...<br />
<br />
Could be because I'm on Varking? I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />

Doubtful, though.</div></div><hr />

im lvl 16 and maxed stealth skill and dont have much problem either... just boost the damn speed abit &gt;_&lt;   (and give ravage higher base crit chance!!)</div></div><hr />

That was a patch or 2 ago so who knows now. <br />
Or maybe its working on just enemys.  (im on varking too)<br />

I've also seen a ranger in stealth and i saw him a mile away, could be cause hes a ranger or didnt have his sneak/hide skilled up....<br />

think the duel was the problem.. i dueled a lvl 17 psi today and i  could see him in invis =p, and most rangers dont max their sneak/hide</div></div><hr />

I got told tonight by a 28 shadow warrior that he could see through my stealth. =(<br />
<br />
My response: That it wasn't for sneaking. It was for me to crit Ravage on him so I could Shank him (which I did). :grin</div></div><hr />

So does anyone know how that works?  If one person detects you, you hear a woosh sound.  Does that mean that everyone can see you at that point or just that person?  I don't think I've ever heard a second woosh sound after the first, so I've no idea of any subsequent people detecting me after the first one.  I don't know who the detector is either, for that matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so much to say...<br />
<br />
first, as to duels... Weeks ago i dueled a friend and he couldnt see me, then a dueled him again and he could... so they appear to function just like &quot;real&quot; pvp...<br />
<br />
second of all the whoosh sound... Yes that means that someone has seen through your stealth and it can be usefull.  but what if i'm running through town or a highly populated area... which one of those 5 characters was the one that could see me? so i agree, would be nice if we could get something like a name color change etc etc...<br />
<br />
I already posted some of this over at silky-venom but i figure i might as well reiterate... one of the recent patches made some small changes to stealth in pve that i believe bled over to pvp... basically i think that all PC characters were flagged as being able to see through stealth (regardless of level) at perception radius rather than &quot;Aggro radius&quot; <br />
<br />
if thats not the case i just dont understand what is going on... last month i had groupmates complaining that they couldnt see me when i was 2 feet away backstabbing the mob, this month i get seen by EVERYONE from 20+ meters away...just today i got a friendly wave from a lvl 3 bard while i was banking in stealth. (i am lvl 44 with max sneak / hide)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daut</div><div class="date">04-05-07, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 20 levels higher since making this post, and obviously a bit more learned to game mechanics that I was before.<br />
<br />
Yes, at some point level (and therefore skill) became a non-issue when seeing through stealth.  I hear the woosh sound when people in their teens run by me.  I have maxed stealth at level 30.  This has GOT to be fixed.  At the same time, I've been attached by a player 4 levels higher than me and when I hit smoke bomb and slunk away I was undetected.  i know it's a matter of which direction the enemy is facing and how quickly I move away, but this is all very confusing!<br />
<br />
A note on PvP... Rogues can be very successful while in group PvP.  We are often not targetted before other classes, and if this is the case we can take down players quickly.  The trick is to assist your groupmates!  I can't say enough about the joys of smoke trick in PvP, although I do wish the range was a bit further.<br />
<br />
I personally don't think that stealth will be fixed for PvP anytime in the near future.  It is arguably a PvP-only issue that they won't address until the masses of PvE bugs get worked out.</div></div><hr />
