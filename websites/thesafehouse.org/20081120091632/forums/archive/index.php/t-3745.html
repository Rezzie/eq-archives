<br />
He quads 700, rampages every round.  Quad 700 is same as vindi, we use a 3 cleric, 5-6 second CH rotation on Vindi (tank is 8200hp max buffed, max defensive aa's).<br />
<br />
We have no shot at fielding 6 clerics for 2 rotations (MT+RT) against AL any time soon (4 main clerics in guild, getting them all on + our 1 bot cleric would be an act of god), so do we have no chance againt him?  I know we could agro kite, but it would seem that we'd waste as much if not more mana as a rotation from blast healing the kiter+RT ... any suggestions?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_kaladornus</div><div class="date">10-01-03, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about bumping up the mana regen on the 3 clerics and tanking with a 3 second Cheal Chain with the Same MA when he is off Defensive?<br />
<br />
Quad 700 with Max Defensive AA's should be very, very low DPS.<br />
<br />
4 clerics on a 6 second chain for 3 minutes and a 3 second chain for 3 minutes should be attainable if that is the amount of time your DPS needs to win.<br />
<br />
Are you telling me that your clerics are completely OOM after 3 mins on Vindicator at 6 second CH rotation with a 8.2k Tank with max defensive AA's?<br />
<br />
Does not compute....Our 3 clerics (one 65, one 56, one 53) only ran OOM (and only the 53 one, a bot) on Vindicator after 5 minutes and 17 seconds of Cheal Rotation on 2 Tanks. (one with 7k hit points and one with 7.4k hit points.)<br />
<br />
This is with 19 people (only 14 doing real DPS)...<br />
<br />
P.S. I can keep going hehe, We had No Paragon, No Bardsong, No Mindwrack, No Twitching...<br />
<br />
Check again bud on Vindicator and try and keep your MA up for 6 minutes....see what happens.<br />

Keep him crippled too and he wont rampage nearly as bad, but he annuls himself.  Kite, keep debuffs on, keep MT up, you win.  He's 3 groupable with good dps, and ppl who know what they're doin.<br />

Only thing I can think of is to find a druid to put in instead of a cleric or something.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't keeping one tank, or mana regen, its having enough clerics for the 2 rotations I'm assuming you need on AL (since he rampages every round) unless I'm missing something.</div></div><hr />

You definitely don't take nearly as much damage as the Ramp Tank as you do as MA....<br />
<br />
Hehe Stevo Beat me to it, but don't worry, you can keep that Tank up for sure.<br />
<br />
If you are really concerned you could have a defensive warrior Ramp Tank, but better to allow a self-Healing Paladin (high hps) to Ramp Tank along with Two or Three dedicated Healers in that Paladins group.<br />
<br />
Like Stevo said, get the Cripple on and the Rampage gets to be even less...</div></div><hr />

The last time we did AL the clerics ended up mostly nuking.  Clerics do nice damage on him too.  Judging from the contents of our healing channel, we all enjoyed that.<br />
<br />
The time before, we did him with like one cleric and a druid (I missed that one).<br />

<br />
Wasnt this confirmed as a bannable exploit a while back by a_GM_0304?<br />
<br />
What ever happened to that debate? <br />
<br />
I am not trying to troll, just trying to find out what happened to the &quot;legality&quot; of this tactic.<br />
<br />
I have considered this an exploit so we've always done 2 tanks.  1 on 6 second rotation (3 clerics), the other on 10 (1 cleric 1 druid).  Both tanks max AA.  Aggro load and AET because MT is stunned 60% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ProphetOmniz</div><div class="date">10-02-03, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a 10 second CH rotation works on rampage tank then we'll have no problems, I am just confused as to how the rampage tank can take that much less damage than MT if you're 2 straight tanking him.  Even if he's crippled he's still going to rampage 80% of melee rounds, at least.  Rampage can still proc on a full round of misses, iirc.<br />
<br />
And again with people mentioning mind wrack and stuff, my point is not our clerics running out of mana, just not having enough clerics to run a chain on our tanks with 2 tanking him.  If a 10 second works on RT though, we can pull it off I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cripple works, but he anulls himself almost immediately, if you're going to keep him crippled you'll need two shamans doing that.<br />
<br />
We do him with 4 clerics + 2 druids pretty easily.</div></div><hr />

He self annuls on a timer so crippling is worth doing, while it takes debuffs to land cripple it isn't all that hard.<br />

2 Druids can easily keep your rampage tank alive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont see how aggro kiting is exploiting... <br />
<br />
For DaraminEQ: Aggro kiting = letting MT gain aggro via spells/etc for a short period of time before everyone else engages.  At 97% he start summoning, when this happens the MT just backs up.  He'll summon every 12 seconds.  If this was an exploit, im sure they'd just up the summon frequency to invalidate the tactic.  Rooted mobs arent like traditional 'ive rooted x mobs' when it comes to the person the mob melees.  A permarooted mob will only pay attention to the MT, and stand there and do nothing until he can summon and beat the crap out of him (thus proccing rampage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Keadaian Songborne</div><div class="date">10-04-03, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's called aggro kiting because it's like a kite group in PoV... sorta.  One person builds massive aggro and runs away while the mob chases him.  Meanwhile, everyone else can go nutso on the mob from behind and not draw aggro.  <br />
<br />
&quot;perma rooted&quot; mobs aren't actualy rooted.  They have a movement speed of 0.  That's why they don't act like player rooted mobs.<br />
<br />
Whether it's an exploit or not, I'm with the side that says it's gimp.<br />
<br />
As to the actual topic...  The answer is &quot;it depends&quot;.<br />
<br />
You didn't give us nearly enough information.  If your MT and RT are in plane of time gear, you won't need any clerics.  If they're both in tov/kael armor and don't have most of their defensive aa's, you probably won't have enough with 4 clerics.<br />
<br />
I would also suggest you consider having your tanks use evasive instead of defensive on this mob.<br />
<br />
Asking a question like &quot;how many clerics do we need for mob x&quot; on this board is relatively pointless.  Many of the posters here are in time guilds, many are in elemental, and quite a few are well below that level.  Each of them will have a different response based on their own guild's ability/experience/gear when what you really want is information that will help you based on YOUR ability/experience/gear...<br />
<br />
My current guild uses a tank w/ approx 8500 hp's as MT and warrior with about 7500 hp's as secondary tank.  The MT has LR3 but no ID, the RT doesn't have CA 3 yet.  We use a 3 cleric chain on MT and a 2 cleric chain on the RT, both use evasive disc.  That's generaly more than enough healing and we don't really have much trouble with AL.  My gut feeling is that we could do it with 3 clerics and 2 druids if push came to shove, but it would be a more difficult (and fun) fight that way.</div></div><hr />

3 clerics can't do a 3 second CH chain.<br />

Quote:4 clerics on a 6 second chain for 3 minutes and a 3 second chain for 3 minutes<br />
<br />
4 clerics can't do a 3 second CH chain.<br />
<br />
It takes 12.5 seconds + lag time, or about 13 seconds, to cast one CH and be able to start the next cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Phantron</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suspect abusing permarooted mobs isn't considered an exploit because these mobs are pretty much trivial anyway (especially by today's standards). <br />
<br />
Even with the constant spam of rampage, the RT does not take nearly as much damage as the MT.<br />
<br />
Could've sworn Arch Lich didn't dual wield.  He's blue to 65 if I recall and that's not in the auto dual wield range.  I seem to recall he's harder if he has a weapon because he will use it and start dual wielding and that increases his DPS considerably.<br />
<br />
Unless your gear is horribly subpar for this encounter, level 65 HPs + buffs should easily bridge whatever gap you may have versus the guilds that did them back when level 60 was the level cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_MadroneDorf</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">different guilds have different definitions for pause's...<br />
<br />
for example on reparm some guilds use a &quot;zero second&quot; pause, which means they case as soon as they see their name, and it takes about 8 seconds to keep this up...<br />
<br />
doesnt really makse sense unless u remember to factor in lag time/human reactions...<br />
<br />
and some guilds call the same thing  1 or 1.5 second pause because thats the actual pause between the CH's, even tho using a /pause  10 or counting to 1 in head wouldnt work great cause of lag/human reaction.. theres probaly a standard way to say it but people generally call it what their guild does even tho it may not be unviersally understood</div></div><hr />

Druids do a fine job keeping up a RT np, I've even done it with just two without difficulty. I'd stress paying more attention to the RT tho if you have an odd number of healers (If you had 5 total, 2 to MT, 3 to RT), because it's much easier to replace a MT than it is an RT unless you set multiples in an RT order. Paladins can stun but that takes all the fun out of the fight and for the full AL experience I'd discourage it (he's not even that hard). It gets really interesting when he has a Tendonslicer too.</div></div><hr />

First, did his knockback/stun cause any problems for anyone else?  If so, how did you overcome it?  Which way do you face him?  We had him face away from door.  Also, I am not sure how, but we couldn't seem to keep or get ramp set right.  It was almost like he mem blurred himself lol.<br />
<br />
We tried mem bluring AL before entering the room but when you /assist arch lich it never would drop people from his agro list.  Any ideas why?  We had 2 enchanters cast till oom to try and clear his agro and when you /assist him he always had someone targeted.  Does this not particularly mean he has agro?  After 3 or 4 mem blurs if he has someone targeted on /assist could his rampage list still be clean?  My concern of course is for setting ramp correctly.<br />
<br />
We screwed up the first attempt on him but got a cleric out and got back up and running.  To attempt and make SURE we set ramp correctly we had everyone log out, had our MT and 2 rampage tanks log in and shoot arrows to set ramp, then had everyone else log back in.  Once we did this we finished buffing and all that and engaged...I ran out from pillar to hide behind ledge (still hiding from AE) and wham I am taking rampage.  I must of been like the 10th or so person to log in, PLUS we had the rampage tanks shoot arrows and they were the only ones in AL's room.  How the @$#!$ was ramp not set right?  We have done many rampaging mobs before and had no problems setting ramp, but this was almost a nightmare...especially on a mob that Ramps as much as AL &gt;).  This seems like a fairly easy fight for us if we could keep ramp on one or two tanks (maybe have one taking ramp if other gets knocked back/stun).  Am I missing something here?  Also, alot of people recommend going into AL's room after his guards are dead then blurring/setting ramp...won't u get proximity agro there and screw up your ramp list?

<br />
AL does not Quad for 700, he doubles, look at your logs.<br />
<br />
He puts out around ~220 DPS on the MT and ~110 or so on the RT.<br />
<br />
A single cleric can keep a 8k tank up for a long time against his rampage.<br />
<br />
He was nerfefd to be no longer stunnable, so 'stunning' him to prevent him melee'ing no longer works.<br />

3 clerics on a 7 second line on MT + 2 druids + random shammies for rampage will work without a zerg.<br />
<br />
You can try to 'aggro' kite him, but it is more trouble than its worth as its fairly easy to steal aggro from him.</div></div><hr />

My wife sits besides me playing an enchanter and she and another enchanter went oom casting mem blurr and /assist arch lich still brought up a target...I bet mem blurr hit him like 20 times.  Any ideas why this is happening?  This also happened to us on IV when we try to mem blurr the debuffer off IV's agro list, but we just relog the debuffer quick and /assist IV brings up no target.<br />
<br />
Reading about his AE's it appears both are unresistable...I am surprised his AE Knockback / stun hasn't caused more trouble for folks with knocking back the RT's and keeping agro on MT.  No one seems to mention this much...are we missing something simple here? Edited by: mrman823 at: 1/25/04 7:35 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible to keep him crippled, I just kept my shaman right on AL and crippled / Radiant cured every time it was needed. his dispel is something like 45 seconds, it's not that bad really.<br />
<br />
and I'm pretty sure he quads   just remember to turn him towards one of the crypt stones. And for the memblur problem.. you're leaving people in his agro radius. Also, his rampage distance ends on the wall, so if you can find a sweetspot on the wall + hide from the AE as a caster, you're golden. (also a great place for clerics to try and get off of ramps if they get on them)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ProphetOmniz</div><div class="date">01-27-04, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">after actually doing him ... yeah he's a joke.  1 cleric on rampage tank, 3 clerics doing an 8 second rotation on MT.  Evasive disc like stated (tanks = 6300hp/1400AC unbuffed).<br />
<br />
Biggest thing I think is he's level 63, which probably helps tank mitigation a ton.  Either way his dps is crap, we could probably do him with 1 cleric on each tank, but havent had to try yet.</div></div><hr />

We tried mem bluring AL before entering the room but when you /assist arch lich it never would drop people from his agro list. Any ideas why?<br />

Rampage list.<br />
<br />
Once on it, can't be changed, except by death, succor, or camping out.<br />
<br />
Do not let your debuffers get put on Rampage List, or you'll fight sh!t unslowed and undebuffed until they get battle-rezzed.<br />
<br />
Steel Warrior has best info on The Ramp List, sorry I don't have the URL handy.<br />
<br />
Helps to put SK's and Monks on it... or Pallies... and, of course Warriors... but healers and debuffers are a big no-no.<br />
<br />
All should camp and reform if you think the Ramp List is fuxxored.<br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />

Just have a monk pull the room, tell nobody to heal or buff him and have no bard songs up.. then fd and voila, a cleared room with a fresh AL ready to set rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_jocke98</div><div class="date">01-27-04, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was a while since I did luclin mobs but as I remember the mob didnt drop its /ass target even after successfull memblur, its a programming bug (or feature) so you cant be 100% a blur is successful.<br />
<br />
after 8 memblurrs we usually called it safe and let the ramptank(s) plug the mob</div></div><hr />

Otherwise he just doubles.</div></div><hr />

Camping out works wonders if you're that scared = )</div></div><hr />

I think we found the problems we were having setting rampage and I agree this guy will be a gimp once we have rampage set.  I will post how we do next time we fight him...  I definately predict a win though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dexail</div><div class="date">02-01-04, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">best way that i've found to set rampage for this is to kill the bard songs, and have your MT and 2 or 3 plate tanks pull AL's room after you clear the mobs past the traps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Phantron</div><div class="date">02-01-04, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just redid AL for fun recently.  His toss back lowers endurance so you pretty much will only get one defensive type disc off him because he'd drain all your endurance before any of them refreshes.  So if he's actually difficult for you, keep this in mind.  I've heard people are able to redisc without endurance but when I tried to redo /evasive it wore off with 6 minutes or so on refresh time when I ran out of endurance which is way earlier than normal.</div></div><hr />
