got me&quot;. At this point in my MMO/MMORPG gaming life, I have gotten used<br />
to being somewhat of a Professional Beta Tester. I am used to being in<br />
Betas, testing, evaluating and then reporting on the games and then<br />
rarely going that extra step and buying an account once it goes live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Continued...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />

Those are actually nice.  One of the freshest takes on the female game model ive seen in a while.  Chick has those baby fat arms!  I love thats awesome.  I was looking at this screenshot specifically:<br />
http://www.thesafehouse.org/mugshots/album17/ScreenShot00105<br />
<br />
Very feminine without being over the top.<br />
<br />
In fact I am impressed over all by the use of what appears to be a conservative approach to new graphics technology.  Artistically its nicely styled.<br />

EQ is lucky I have the daily cliq group that is married to EQ or this might sucker me in for a run.</div></div><hr />

Overall if its like DDO i dunno if it will last. In DDO if you had a dedicated group to doing instances you could prob reach max level in a month then be left with very little end game content. Just hope they are better at pumping out the content then they where with DDO.</div></div><hr />

There is one big Patch already... Shores of Evendim so perhaps they will keep up. One thing I noticed is that folks are quite into holding RP events. And since you can actually play instruments and make up songs it seems like a lot of folks are doing that as well as doing crafts. Perhaps it will keep them busy. Personally I've no problem with content, as I'm still playing other games.<br />

I'm adding more pics to the screenshot collection.</div></div><hr />
