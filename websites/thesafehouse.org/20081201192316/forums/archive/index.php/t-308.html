<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vilkata Tasavalt</div><div class="date">03-22-00, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tonight I was in a nice little Avatar group..at least...it would have been nice, had we gotten into the room:)<br />
We got all set to get into the pool room up top, pulled the top, cleared it just fine.<br />
Then, we all invis up, swim down the bubble, past the Avatar...everyone makes it but one of our Clerics.  He ends up being attacked halfway down, and dies FAST.  We all proceed to be attacked by the Avatar, a fanatic, a herald, a justicar...and our Enchanter isn't mezzing.  We ALMOST got the Avatar...it was SO close.  Second Cleric dies, Tank Dies...its me and Wizard left.  Avatar looks at me and laughs at how this little pathetic Rogue is trying to tank him, and in his flailing laugh he smacks me around.  Hard. :)<br />
Whole group is dead.   I go down to scout out the situation, make it all the way down, back all the way up the wall..thinking I am safe, I begin to loot.  Next thing I know, there's the Avatar, in my face.  BOOM.  Double Dead Rogue. :)<br />
I spend the next hour and a half dragging everyone's corpses up the bubble and to the CY for a 50th level Resurrection that someone(Wynter) was kind enough to be doing.  I go back down at last for my corpse..BANG.  There goes Spirit of the Wolf.  So now I am stuck at the bottom of the bubble, both corpses sitting there.<br />
Short time later half the group decides to leave.  One group member logs on his 50th Necro to help split spawn better so we can save my sorry butt:)  He and the three leftover members finally break the room, Wynter comes down and tries to resurrect me.  Corpse is too old!<br />
I was feeling alright...at least I had gotten everyone else out.<br />
Ah well.<br />
Then, just as I am telling the group that I have to head to bed, the Avatar spawns.  We take it down fast(thanks to the 50th Necro still being around:) and it has the Ravenscale!<br />
Necro rolls, I WIN.<br />
Bristlebane smiled upon me, friends.  I now am wearing a stylish new Ravenscale Chestguard.<br />
(I then split all the cash I had on me with the group, because I was so happy:)<br />
