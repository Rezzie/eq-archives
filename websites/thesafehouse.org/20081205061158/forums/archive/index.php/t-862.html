<br />
We were celebrating our 2nd anniversary this weekend, and after walking around in Greenwich Village all evening, I crashed out in the hotel room with the TV still on.  (usually can't fall asleep with the TV on unless I'm exhausted)<br />
<br />
When I wake up in the morning, he tells me that a Coors Light commercial came on, saying how it had less carbs than Miller Lite, and said something about &quot;So drink a Coors Light&quot;.<br />
<br />
To which my sonambulant reply was a clear as day &quot;nuh-uh&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm a beer snob even while asleep.  <br />
<br />
BTW, if you ever get a chance to go to New York City, try one of the three &quot;Heartland Brewery&quot; locations.  Good food and great beer at decent prices. (Back In Black)<br />

<br />
Though I can drink hard liquor much easier and to a better effect.<br />
<br />
Coors Light isn't so bad now.<br />
But when I want to splurge, Killian Red is what I go for.  Beck's is also great.  I used to like Guiness but don't for some reason now.<br />
Also, some beer called Batinburg, or Burglinbatt, some imported german beer was pretty decent. <br />

<br />
As a result, I tend towards the darker and/or more full bodied beers these days.  As for mass-produced stuff, I can tolerate Killian's Red and Bass Ale.  I tend to like microbrews better though, and my friend Flip is actually a pretty decent brewer in his own right.  His &quot;Drunken Druid&quot; is a far better stout than Guiness, and that's saying a lot.</div></div><hr />

That's my experience atleast. If I'm just having a couple beers then I'll take some guiness or lagunitas but if I'm partying, it's cheap beer.</div></div><hr />

Amen to that.  The only thing that can compete is Guinness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still can't believe one of my co-workers has been to Germany, loves the beers over there, and still drinks our pitiful Czech-knockoff Budweiser.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Belgian lambic beers are the absolute most wonderful thing I've ever had in my life, but I have to be careful because they're like the wine coolers of the beer world - they are these lovely effervescent sparkling fruit-flavored beers in flavors like raspberry, peach, black currant - and will knock your socks off because they taste like soda and you forget that you're drinking beer, until you've had five or six and don't feel your butt on the barstool anymore.<br />
<br />
I also tried Leffe Blonde this weekend when we were at the Belgian beer bar. (they also serve mussels and fries!)  Very interesting *****-colored beer with a very distinct hops flavor.</div></div><hr />

Heffy is good too).  Not premium or anything, but I like it.<br />
<br />
I'll be heading out to Seattle again in a month or so, so I'll be able to load up on all of that beer that's tougher to get here in the east (Mac and Jacks, Pyramid, Alaskan Amber, Red Hook, etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the Belgians and other Euros I know in EQ (my old guild had a big Euro component) say that Stella is &quot;an old man's beer&quot;   <br />
<br />
Yuengling is nice.  I have a semi-rant about it tho - I had 5 bottles in the fridge of a nice Black &amp;amp; Tan - and 3 weeks later, I felt like having one - to find 2 Budweisers in the place of my 5 Yuenglings !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !  Stupid brother's friends drank MY beer and left their crappy stuff behind! Edited by: Dragynphyre at: 3/10/04 11:25 am</div></div><hr />
