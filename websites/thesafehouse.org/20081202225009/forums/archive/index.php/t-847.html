<br />
Quote: The schedule for the new Saturday Toonami block has been released, and tons of new-to-Toonami stuff is headed your way! It'll be airing from 7PM-2AM. That's right, 2AM, not midnight! That gives us 2 extra hours! Whoo! (NOW are you mad that Adult Swim lost its Saturday block? ;-)~ ) Not only that, but there's also a whole bunch of other surprises on the way, too! <br />
<br />
- .hack//SIGN, Duel Masters, Cyborg 009, and Samurai Jack return! <br />
<br />
-Gundam SEED premieres on opening night! <br />
<br />
-New episodes of Transformers: Energon, Duel Masters, and Knights of the Zodiac will be premiering on this block! (And, if we're lucky, we just might get Cyborg 009's banned episode after all!) <br />
<br />
-Teen Titans and Dragonball GT will have dual airings on both this block AND Miguzi! <br />
<br />
-Movies continue at 8.0PM, with a repeat at 10.0PM, and we get some NEW movies, too, including the skipped Dragonball Z movie &quot;Lord Slug&quot;! <br />
<br />
-When Megas XLR premieres on May 1, it will be double-stripped, meaning we get a full hour instead of 30 minutes on its premiere night! Yeah, baby! Also, Rave Master premieres on the same night! Sweeeeeeeeeeeeet! <br />
<br />
But the surprises don't stop there! It turns out that Miguzi will be more than just 2 hours a day. It'll also have a weeknight block from 9:30-11PM! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">03-07-04, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">blah , some good stuff on toonami , saddly cartoon network show crap here and never show toonami , we get reruns of tom and jerry ( its nice but it can't handle that much reruns )<br />
and some crap cartoon like  ed eddie and edieed ( whatever u spell it )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The good:<br />
Gundam SEED at 9:30<br />
<br />
The bad:<br />
Teen Titans at 1:30 AM WTF!<br />
Knights of the Zodiac at 12:30 - if they were going to air it on the ass end of the night past a time when children should be in bed, it should have remained uncut as St. Seiya dammit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Norpin</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm, 9:30 for Gundam Seed.  That means it'll still get edited for violent content and blood.  That's going to really mess with some important episodes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, from the example of Knights of the Zodiac, I'd say that any editting they would do would happen regardless of 9:30 or 12:30.  <br />
<br />
There was bound to be some editting anyway, it's unavoidable really.  I suspect there won't be as much as you fear though.</div></div><hr />
