<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ShadowJax</div><div class="date">06-20-00, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rain pattered softly on the docks of Freeport as I quietly crept along the shore. I was to fetch the head of Lyda, the taverns owners daughter, and give it to Nabi in Neriak. Nabi said that one of my skills (lvl 8 ) would be more than a match for this light dwellers daughter. I snapped back to where I was. It was dark and the smell of the local wares could still be caught on the wind. Using the skills I had grown to used toI managed to get inside the taven and to the room where Lyda was.<br />
     She was standing cleaning the counters of the bar upstairs murming about todays hard work. I smiled. She would no longer have have to worry about work no longer. My heart pounded with the feat I was about to attempt. If I failed shame and even death could result. Slinking like a cat I crept along the wall to where she was. Like one born of the shadows I lept out and slid my dagger between her shoulder missing her back. (Dont have Backstab yet hehe) She screamed and turned around only to catch another blow across the head. This stunned her but she ran to the common room down stairs. In pursuit I threw daggers which embedded in her back. Lyda slowed still screaming for help as I slit her throat. Red like that of a sunset spread across her. I thanked the dancer in the common room for keeping the men so rowdy. Without their hollering Lyda's shouts would have been heard.<br />
     I took her head as my trophy and by the luck of unknow force managed to creep back outside with her dripping head. Thinking I was free I raced toward the ocean. Thats when screams of murder were shouted and I lept into the ocean vanishing beneath the dark waters. <br />
<br />
Nabi thanked me for my deed and as my reward I received the cintured whip.</div></div><hr />
