<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">07-11-06, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So how we doing on attendance? I'm going to be there, and took this morning to do all the collectible running around and such. Tomarro is modual two release (sucks that it isn't today.) But we can expect to have a crap load more we haven't done.. to do. I mean.. they can't only add &quot;highest level raid stuff&quot; can they? And maybe I can finally get rid of those silver bowls and such.  Anyhow, where was I... hmm oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">07-11-06, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds like were only getting Restless Isles (http://www.ddo.com/forums/showthread.php?&amp;postid=510679#post510679) quests, but I reckon we can do the lower tier of those, or at least have fun while we die trying.  Me, I'm mostly looking forward to patronage and spell swapping anyway (boy, did I screw up my spell selection).<br />
<br />
Tonight, I say we do South Threnal again if we get the full group.  Troz was looking for new goggles and I don't believe he has a protection item, and I want a coin belt.  If we're missing somebody, hmm, Stormcleave?<br />
<br />
We also need to talk about recruiting to fill our empty slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sillis</div><div class="date">07-11-06, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I already have 4 spells lined up to swap on my bard that I have outgrown.  It may take two weeks to get them all swapped, but life shall be better.  I just hit 10, so being able to drop hold person and some others comes at just the right time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">07-11-06, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hoping to make it tonight altho sadly DDO is wearing thin, we've done damn near everything a single group can do, hell we've done some stuff we shouldn't have been able to do.  <br />
<br />
I am in talks with a good friend from my old EQ guild and I made a passing comment about pen and paper and he jumped on the idea like a rabid monkey.  He knows someone who would DM, plus he might even know 2 or 3 others who might join in.  Shoulld I discuss it further and work on some details with him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">07-11-06, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should be there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">07-11-06, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna have to change that from hoping to make it, to highly unlikely.  :frown</div></div><hr />
