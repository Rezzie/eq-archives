<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ggwalmsley@yahoo.com</div><div class="date">09-27-04, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the quest, as stated by thottbot:<br />
<br />
Level 20	Rogue<br />
	Horde<br />
Travel to the Venture Co. Tower, north of the Sludge Fen and contact the Shattered Hand's covert operative, Taskmaster Fizzule.<br />
<br />
When the tower is in sight, use the Flare Gun to signal your arrival to Taskmaster Fizzule. Fire off TWO flares, then approach Taskmaster Fizzule and perform the Shattered /Salute.<br />
<br />
These actions must be performed in the correct order, as Fizzule will attack and terminate any person he does not recognize.<br />
The Venture Company... Perhaps you have heard of them?<br />
<br />
For one year we have worked on planting an agent deep within their ranks. Through much hard work and careful planning, we succeeded.<br />
<br />
Recently we received word that the Venture Co. are planning something of a grand scale. Go north of the Sludge Fen to the Venture Co. tower and contact our undercover agent, Taskmaster Fizzule.<br />
<br />
When you find the tower, use this flare gun, then approach Fizzule and show him the salute of the Shattered Hand.<br />
<br />
So, I have attempted this quest two times now. I fired the flare TWICE, I then approached him and tried the salute. He doesn't turn neutral after the two flares, however he does not attack me when I move closer either. So he isn't turning yellow (neutral). Naturally, he won't respond to the /salute so I am unable to continue the quest.<br />
<br />
Has anyone run into this problem? Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

If that doesn't work, abandon the quest and get it again, then redo it.  I had to do that to get Shattered Salute to work.[/spoiler:fc364f3a51]</div></div><hr />
