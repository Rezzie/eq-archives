<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sneakster Shenanigans</div><div class="date">06-30-02, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&amp;lt;Sneakster looks around nervously; this is the first time he has made his presence known outside of the Cellar in a while&gt;<br />
<br />
I am considiering getting this game, but I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
Is it fun?<br />
<br />
Is it easy to play with no real knowledge of D&amp;amp;D?<br />
<br />
Is the single player version as fun (or more fun) than the multiplayer?  Is there good replayability?<br />
<br />
Are the bugs mostly worked out?<br />
<br />
Can a casual player do well here?  I like to be able to log in and out when I choose, can I leave a multiplayer game without much warning?  (this is what I always hated about raiding in EQ;  I hate making day-long commitments)<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate you all taking the time to read and answer these.  I know you all would be DEVASTATED if Sneakster didn't make an appearence in the game.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;Sneakster dives into the shadows...we wouldn't want a tan from being outside of the Cellar to long, now would we?&gt;<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
Sneakster of the Thicket</div></div><hr />

<br />
No D&amp;amp;D=No problem....whats great about this game is the manual has everything you need and if you ever want to play pnp dnd your WAY ahead of the game after playing nwn.<br />
<br />
The singleplayer is AMAZING....there is probably 60+ hours of gaming needed to finish it.  <br />
<br />
Bugs?  The patches make it better<br />
<br />
As a casual player its hard to say right now...when people start coming out with more in depth and interesting mods we'll see<br />
<br />
As far as replayability goes....its endless</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ran around in sneak mode killing until I could get a henchman. :P<br />
<br />
I liked BG &amp;amp; BG2, but NWN is soo mcuh smoother and cleaner look and playability.</div></div><hr />
