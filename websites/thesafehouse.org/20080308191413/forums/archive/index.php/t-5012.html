<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargesh</div><div class="date">04-02-02, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone give me an idea as too how rare the Crypt robber bracers are from the hunters?  I have probably killed a couple of hundred of these guys now and haven't seen one drop yet. <br />
<br />
3 pair of boots, a helm, a pair of leggings, a rapier and a bow but no damn bracers.  It's not too bad because I am soloing up there for xp but it is definately getting to the point where I am going to be better off in Cats and I would like a bracer before I go.<br />
<br />
Actually, while I am asking, what's the way to go with weapons at the 29-30 range?  I have a despoiled gladius in primary, but still using a Keltio defender in offhand.  Is the Preatorian Gladius hard to come by?  Should I just wait until I can do the Lion Fang quest at 30?  Are there other options I'm not aware of?  I have just started playing again after a 5 month break, so the latter is entirely possible.<br />

Cullyn - 15 Shadowblade - Merlin<br />

**More newb questions to ask**<br />

***Btw, can one of the mods move this to the correct forum please, only just realised that I put it in the wrong place.*** Edited by: Dargesh  at: 4/2/02 11:48:01 pm</div></div><hr />
