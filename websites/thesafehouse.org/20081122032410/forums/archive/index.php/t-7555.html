<br />
Anyway, they said they were &quot;fixing&quot; resists for the upper levels because PvP Casters (read: naked gankers) were having trouble getting spells to stick (read: nuke you at half a bub of life) in the upper levels.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coyoteblack</div><div class="date">05-18-01, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that was just debuffs I think.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-18-01, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They probably originally intended to have it just debuffs, and then said heck and they did it to every spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Thisle</div><div class="date">05-21-01, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive also noticed these changes.  It seems now, that if somone is 8lvls higher a snare/root will stick 60% of the time.  I remember having 101mr and a ranger snaring me(who was indeed 8lvls up.)

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mordier</div><div class="date">05-21-01, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing they can't get through their thick heads is that a caster doesn't need to root/snare to win a fight, but a succesful root/snare against a melee will almost certainly win that fight.  <br />
<br />
Snare is death.  One good snare can mean fight over, end of story.  Snare, run, dot, nuke, nuke...dead rogue.  For the rogue to win he has to stay on top of the opponent the whole time, dealing with laggy &quot;your target is too far away&quot; messages and line of sight tricks.<br />
<br />
Sure a pumice can negate that root/snare/dot, but casting time aside, I play with people in their 30s who can't afford pumice.  15-20p per pumice adds up fast.  It might win you ONE fight and then you're out of charges.  You made 3 gold off that guy?  Good, you've just lost money on your kill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">05-21-01, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They couldn't figure out how to lower resists on debuffs so they did it to the whole magic-based line both in P v E and P v P.  On the brighter side for rogues, it does mean poisons should be more effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coyoteblack</div><div class="date">05-22-01, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know if this will be fixed? , looked into?<br />
Is there some kind of resist combo that will allow us to live? Or dies you MR have to be 200+ or if your mr is to high will it be rendered useless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Karlek</div><div class="date">05-23-01, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember owning a cleric 2 lvls above me few weeks ago<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
dying to cleric 4+ lvls above me just recently.<br />
<br />
My MR was abouts 80 in both cases, and in first case i resisted as good as ALL his wrath spells, receiving ONLY 30 damage out of 6-8 of them.<br />
<br />
In second example I partially resisted one wrath and received 52 damage, while all other 6 or 8 hit me for 152.<br />
<br />
So I think that 4+ lvls make huge difference no matter your resists.<br />

Where and how would I go about contacting VI about this problem? Maybe I can make some kind of written communacation followed up by a phone call.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-23-01, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah, you lose/gain 5 resist per levels difference. For example, if you are fighting someone at the high end of the scope, you have 20 less resists (or 40 less on teams). That can HURT, so keep that in mind.</div></div><hr />
