<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Biggerin</div><div class="date">10-19-02, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, I try to get my skill to 250 one night, and seemed to be stuck on 225 for a long time. 2 hours in fact... Then I realized that there's a level cap...<br />
<br />
So today, I figure what the hell, let's make a grandmaster assasin's vial! I had some cash laying around and I hate unspent cash, so I bought up all the stuff and found some people to help with the jewelery and the pottery.  I get my fingers crossed with the artisan's seal and sealed poison vial in my mortar and pestle. My curser on the combine button, a lucky dorf in my group and a decantor in my ranged slot.<br />
<br />
I cross my fingers and the dorf crosses his beard, and I click hoping for one of two messages: &quot;You lacked the skills&quot; or &quot;You have fashioned the items together to create something new!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You are too inexpirienced in your craft to even consider attempting this combination&quot;<br />
<br />
???<br />
<br />
Luckily, it didn't take my artisan's seal, but I saw people here claiming to have combined the vial at a much lower skill than me, and a smither who made his trophy at a skill of 209 at level 52. <br />
<br />
I had a skill of 225 + 3% (231.75 by my calculations) and am level 55.<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever seen that message before?<br />

I think SOE realized that anyone with the pp and patience can make one.  Quite unfair to the people that actually took the time to raise their make poison skill to 245.  So basically, after the last patch or so, you need to be level 59+ to attain the GMAV.  =D Morticus Belaern<br />

<br />
All the rest of the trade skills can be brought up  by combining stuff up to 250 at any level, yet make poison is capped by level. I'm not using points, I'm training in the skill by making poisons.<br />
<br />
The cap itself doesn't make sense.  It's 5 per level, then stops at 40, the 5 per level again starting at 50? I'm sorry, but that's retarded. I put the work in to get my skill up (not to mention the cash. it's not as bad now with spirit of sloth, but I spent a lot bringing it up this far), I should be able to attempt a combine.<br />

<br />
It it bad in that you can't PL a toon to 250 if you have a ton of cash.<br />
<br />
It is good in that you CAN train more than 20 points in it.<br />
<br />
I have 99 points unused, when I get my make up to 200 I know where my points are going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The post is about if it can STILL be done. And from the looks of the messgae he got and his skill level, I would say something changed.</div></div><hr />

After reading this I worry that they'll take mine away too, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Samedaik</div><div class="date">10-22-02, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to the cost of going for the grandmaster's assassin's vial, there's no way in hell I'd suggest anyone try it with less than 250 skill. Personally, I was lucky and it combined on my first attempt. I was at skill 250, level 60.<br />
<br />
If anyone doesn't know... if you get tired of combining to increase the skill and have some plat to spend (and training points also), visit Stanos. Unlike other rogue trainers I've seen, he will train you all the way to 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_jayrod junteau</div><div class="date">10-23-02, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">any link to a recipe list for GM assassin vial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_fengshmee</div><div class="date">10-23-02, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI.....<br />
60rogue here with a few hundred plat on him decides to checkout the rogue trainer with a (222) skill in Make Poison at the time.  I look at the &quot;Make Poison&quot; ability train slot thinking I didnt have any practices left in it after spending the initial 20 when i started the skill many levels ago.  I say to myself, &quot;What the hell&quot; so I click on &quot;TRAIN&quot;  Well, I burned through that few hundred plat up'ing myskill to (22 ...I run to bank, wash, rinse, repeat.<br />
Guys, 3k later, im (250)skill in make poison.  Mind you, I had 37practice points to spend at the time.  This is the only zone (from what i've seen) that you  are able to advance poison making past 224 - Formerly from Stanos in HighholdPass. <br />
If you have the $$$ and you have practice points AND are past the level restriction, I say go for it!!!!<br />
