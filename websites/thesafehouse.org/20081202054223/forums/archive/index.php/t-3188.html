Lose all the work we've done in single, but much safer against hacking if we do server, and since it's 24/7, server characters has my vote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remmi</div><div class="date">06-21-02, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If there's one thing this ol' dwarf can't stand it's twinks (with elves being a close 2nd!) so server vault would be me vote. But on the flip side, it's cool to show off all yer nifty gear and gadgets that ye've accumulated in yer adventuring career.<br />
<br />
I think it'll come down to what's feasible as far as adventuring career is concered on the Safehouse server. Issues like, can we provide enough adventures to support everyone (eg 100+ players)? IOW, if it's a server vault how is everyone going to &quot;level up&quot; and develop their characters?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not all that familiar with the server rules yet so I can't really say for sure. I do recall talk of a setting that would &quot;evaluate&quot; a character's gear and level but I don't know how it works. But we'll all put our noggins together and come up something soon...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to have adventures, I recommend having a vault and setting standards for Safehouse characters. If you just want it to be a place to hang out online, I think you should let people port over their favorite play character so they can show off the neat stuff they get elsewhere (I'd also recommend an arena for PvP duels in that case).</div></div><hr />

One dedicated server will host the Safehouse &quot;module&quot; and will most likely be for gathering and chatting only. While a second server will be used for running adventuring modules.<br />
<br />
So we *could* do something like allow all characters into the Safehouse server for chatting but only let &quot;Safehouse&quot; built characters into the adventuring modules. <br />
<br />
I wonder if you can have TWO copies of a character with the same name...one Local and one Server...? Anybody know? That way you could have one copy of your character for the Safehouse and one for adventuring.... Of course even if it doesn't support this we could simply create our characters with slight variations in name like &quot;Remmi&quot; and &quot;Remmi the Ornery&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Whether or not it could be realized to its fullest extent im not sure. Heres kinda what i was thinking....<br />
<br />
Massive city module divided into lots of districts. <br />
<br />
Various theives guilds vying for control. PvP enabled. <br />
<br />
Establish &quot;control&quot; areas. Not exactly sure how i would do this yet, but basically have a way for a guild to take control (or more specifically, have the ability to ply their trade in the area with litte fear from authorities) of an area or district and thus get an influx of gold per week because of it. So rival guilds trying to do some work in the area would have a really rough time (like increase the chances of guards finding them, etc). <br />
<br />
Thick political atmosphere so there would be lots of bribing, pay-offs, manuvering going on in the upper ranks of the cities officials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thieves guilds don't repel assaults.  They have windows, fire escapes, planks or ropes to adjacent buildings, entrances to the sewers, all designed so when the city guard comes a knocking the people inside can scatter and have a good chance of not getting caught.<br />
<br />
Also, it should be next door to a tavern.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps the Safe House could be a great jumping off place for servers that may not be up 24/7, a place for us to store our characters and go into worlds we know are well done (a.k.a. approved by the rest of the Safe House).   The linking of servers is something that can turn this into a real MMORPG, with a place like the safe house that is up all the time we would have a place to store legit chars,  hang out till an adventure that intrests us comes along (the chat rooms have already been taken over by l33t d00dz who Pwn you..or some crap like that) etc....<br />

<br />
not alot of work has gone into custom spells at this point in the mod community, but it is being worked on.  dunno how much control they'd get.  It could kinda be like a fear spell, except looks for a placeble object and runs circles around it instead of looking for a wall.  also dunno if you can effect a characters inventory with a spell, it could work similar to disarm.<br />
<br />
So I say, there are better programmers than I out there that could forseeably code such a spell to put on a potion to add to the silliness.  I expect though, that it would be a feature added much later due to demand.  <br />
(I'd say it'd go in before any mini-games, but there's already tutorials using poker out there.)<br />

I wouldn't consider a virtual safehouse as a place I wanted to go to adventure and get exp.  I'd rather it be a place I can visit to chat with people and drink between regular adventures.  With a bunch of rogue stuff around so we can play with our skills if we want.<br />
