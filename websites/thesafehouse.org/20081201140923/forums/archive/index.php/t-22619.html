<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valant</div><div class="date">02-01-06, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ancient world of Telon holds many secrets…Constantly torn with conflict through it’s many ages, civilization has forgotten much of it’s origin…<br />
<br />
Myths and legends, stories of adventure, of life, of death…With the passing of time, many of these tales die out while the minds of men are consumed in the struggle of existence…<br />
<br />
Yet, there are some stories, some forbidden tales that lie in darkness, patiently festering with fierce resolve until they are once again discovered…<br />
<br />
One such legend tells of a band of ancient warriors bound together by cause and purpose…Warriors that have roamed the vast continents of Telon for thousands of years, making their mark on the land through their acts of bravery…<br />
<br />
Only the forgotten scrolls of Telon know of whom I speak, and know there is truth to this mythical tale. The Seraphim, as they are called, are indeed a mysterious clan, appearing but a few times across the centuries. No one can say for certain what their purpose is, except that their presence usually comes at a time of great peril…but the secret will not be kept much longer…the world will soon know...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While providing a close, family-type atmosphere, the Seraphim are now accepting members of all races and professions in an effort to become a prominent guild in our server community. Whether you are a raider, small group PvE enthusiast, hardcore role-player, or die hard PvP fanatic, you will no doubt find a place you can call home within our ranks. We cater to and accept all of these playstyles with our system of diversity, and our formula has been tremendously successful in the past with other MMO's. We plan to have our own player built city within the game, and plan to play a large role in the ongoing story of Telon on our specific server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valant</div><div class="date">02-02-06, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not at all. We are well on our way to having a pretty large guild, and within our ranks, we have players who each have their particular gameplay and play style preferences.<br />
<br />
If the servers are going to be like they have hinted at, there will be faction/race/territory PvP. I doubt we will go to a free for all PvP server, and I think I and the other members are leaning towards faction...<br />
<br />
My point is that even if we did select a faction PvP server, we would still have players that focused mostly on PvE, raiding, PvP, and crafting. In our structure, the persons type of play doesnt dictate whether they fit in or not. In SWG, I had all classes, both casual and hardcore, social and solo, PvP and PvE within my guild ranks, and we co-existed perfectly with over 180 active players on the Chilastra server in our peak.<br />
<br />
So, sorry if I got long winded there, the short answer is that we will not split between servers.<br />
<br />
The summary answer is that the way we handle things internally, players of different style still fit in, and still feel very much at home with us. My philosophy is not to divide a guild between casual or hardcore, PvP or PvE. When you think about it, all PvP players must PvE. Most PvE players love raiding. Most PvP players love raiding as well.... out of those, most of our guys roleplay.....<br />
<br />
All of the playstyles overlap in one way or another, and form one big circle of..uuumm...love? :roll <br />
<br />
So, in the end, we utilize that circle and create an open environment that all our members feel comfortable with. We only advertise the guild in some places as RP-PvP because that is what the majority of our members have a love for. But, by no means are those the only areas we cover.<br />
<br />
Now that Ive talked you all to sleep...any more questions?</div></div><hr />
