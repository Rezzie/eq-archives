However, there is currently no way to get Wind outside of auctions and such. They just ran out of stock. People are trying to get HimeyaShop to restock it. It should not be too long before it starts popping up.<br />

But I just wanted people who were waiting for this info to know. It's an excellent game. It's something of a slice of life high school romance with some supernatural element. Kind of similar to Shuffle!</div></div><hr />
