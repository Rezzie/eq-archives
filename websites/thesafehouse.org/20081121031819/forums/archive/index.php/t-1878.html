<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-30-03, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of you who don't live out here, and don't want to expend more than one brain cell thinking about it, you would probably assume that it's nothing but a bunch of cattle, corn, and tractors.<br />
<br />
Wrong. There are people out here, suburbanites, urban folk, and rural people. We like to buy @#%$, just as much as the next guy/gal. We are consumers, and we like to consume.<br />
<br />
I go to Best Buy today to buy Halo for the PC, and the representative tells me, with a diabolically unappropriate level of enthusiasm that &quot;WELL it says right HERE that we SHOULD have it in today, but as you can SEE, there are no orders placed from the distributor, and there is NO Best Buy in the MIDWEST that has ANY orders placed or ANY thing in stock&quot;.<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;Ok, so when do you reasonably expect a shipment&quot;.<br />
<br />
Him: &quot;GOSH, I don't really know. Maybe next week?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fine. Nevermind the fact that you are the biggest purveyor of software and stuff in the country, I'm sure it's quite alright that none of you have a @#%$ clue.<br />
<br />
So I drive down to Cricket, because I was looking to get a new phone. Roll into the Cricket out-let store, tell them what I want, and the guy looks at me.<br />
<br />
Him: &quot;You want the $150 Flip top phone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;That's what I said&quot;.<br />
<br />
Him: &quot;Uh, well, see, we haven't had that model of phone in for, oh, like 3 weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;Amazing. Who does?&quot;<br />
<br />
Him: &quot;No store in the Midwest right now has them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;You're kidding me right? 3 outlet store in Lincoln, 1 per major city, and like 5 in Omaha, and not a single one of them has this model?&quot;<br />
<br />
Him: &quot;Yeah....we oversold them...&quot;<br />
<br />
Me(turning 4 shades of red): &quot;Ok.......mind telling me when you plan on getting more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Him: &quot;We really don't know&quot;.<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;/sigh&quot;<br />
<br />
Him: &quot;But we do have the $250 Flip top Kyocera in stock, plenty of th.......uh, thanks for coming in....&quot;. As I walk away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really folks, what is the @#%$ deal. I can understand being out of stock, but why does no one @#%$ know? Who the @#%$ is ordering for your stores, chimpanzees? What does it take to put a @#%$ REGION on the distribution map, ridiculous levels of crime, pollution, and traffic? Inner city slums? Like I said....we are people that like to buy @#%$ too. Treating us like 4th class consumers who only get distribution on a quarterly basis is @#%$. And at the very least, if your websites(both Cricket and Best Buy) tell me that you have &quot;Item_001&quot; currently in stock, you'd godamn better well have it sitting on the shelf when I drive across town to come to your store.  &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a big one....a tall drink of water, but I got to tell you, you don't look too bright. I got a son, stupid as a man who bought his stupid at a 2-for-1 sale, and you remind me of him.&quot; -Mr. Nancy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Their distribution system is so screwed up, that its very, very likely that for a popular item, they were sold out of it for that entire that region.<br />
<br />
I worked there for 6 months. Every single damn time we got a sales paper on sundays, By noon every single really good deal was sold clean out. They'd run some insane special, like a well equipped PC for $500 lower than any other place. They'd have 2-4 in the store.<br />
<br />
Know what? Odds are, they wouldn't even have any come to replinish the stock/fill rainchecks for another month.<br />
<br />
They absolutely suck at having the merchandise you want when you want it. Trojan Horseshoes</div></div><hr />

I worked at the one in mansfield Oh, and i would constantly be doing searches in our reigon ( Mich. Ohio. Indiana ) approx 30 stores total, and YES things would be out of stock all across the board. I work in the computer dept. and man it would suck to have everything you don't sell, and to have nothing that your reports show are flying off the shelves...<br />
<br />
I do feel for you and will let you in on a little secret, we put the retards in the media section, they don't have to know much, only the alphabet. <br />
<br />
Also shipments are getting rather low as these months before the holidays are &quot;slow&quot; times for retail, the back to school rush is over, and every one gets a bit lax about everything. <br />
<br />

Best Buy undercuts them a little cheaper, and it's not always completely screwed up, but the majority of the time it is. <br />
<br />
As for my little black rain cloud, don't poke him, he bites. :&quot;&gt; <br />
<br />
Coincidentally, I looked for the phone I did want online, and it has seemingly vanished from production, which pisses me off very badly. I guess they wanted to cut out the mid-range flip top phones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes, Nebraska is pretty crappy for customer service.  One exception is Nebraska Furniture Mart... I have always had good luck with them.  And to those that aren't from Nebraska, NFM sells everything under the sun... electronics, computers, appliances... oh, and furniture too.<br />
<br />
Oh, and not sure if this will make you feel better... but I lived in Missouri for several years and my experience with CS there was 100 times WORSE.  They're just so laid back that any more of customer help is more like a nuisance.<br />

Then the tower was built, Husker football season started and OMG, nobody cared anymore!!<br />
<br />
Omaha is nice in the fact that it's a large city, but you can get anywhere within 20 mins easily.  And, it's set up really well, the highways are good, etc.  But aside from that, I won't miss it when we leave.  I'm a fairly conservative person, and still this city is WAY too conservative for me.  It's like a city full of Rush Limbaughs.<br />

And, we are talking about a city that gets riled up for crap like this...  woot, let's crown a fictional King and Queen from &quot;society&quot; and continue our l33t separatist ways!!

I guess that's what they call excitement there...a sped up video of a 40 story building being built.  WOOOPEEE FRIGGIN DOO!<br />
<br />
And oh!  This just cracked me up.  As a gift for attending the spouses luncheon, my fiance came back with a glass plate with a flower painted on it.  It wasn't even a crushed flower, it was a PAINTED flower on a piece of glass!  One of my co-worker's wife just squealed in elation like a little girl with her first banana seat bike, and said, &quot;it's from Borsheim's!&quot;  I looked at her funny, raised my eyebrow, and said to myself...&quot;SO?  It's a friggin piece of glass with a flower painted on it you hick.  I did that back in 3rd grade arts and craft.  And WTF is Borsheims?  Is that related to Florsheims the shoe store or something?  Where I come from, I only squeal if it's a blue box with the word &quot;TIFFANY'S&quot; on it, hick.&quot;  Of course, I just smiled and nodded.</div></div><hr />

A piece of glass with a painted flower is just that, glass, be it from Borsheims, Tiffany's or the Salvation Army store.  To squeal and be elated about it just because it came from a locally known upscale store is laugh worthy.  All that says to me is that they're a bunch of friggin idiots overpaying for a piece of glass. Edited by: Nyssa Rainwhisper  at: 10/1/03 11:38 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
Believe it or not, different people derive enjoyment from things other than what you derive enjoyment from.  If I see a box from Tiffany's should I think to myself &quot;what a dumb-@#%$ that they overpaid by 50% or more for a piece of jewelry for the sake of being able to say that they bought something from Tiffany's?  <br />
<br />
People make judgments about each other for some of the stupidest things.  Choice of art/decoration/jewelry is probably one of the more stupid ones.  The more we can learn to accept people are different from us, the better our world will be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weren't you judging me?<br />
<br />
Do also keep in mind, people who spend millions on Picassos affect my wallet none.  However, my company spending excessively on a piece of glass affects me PLENTY since it comes out of MY profit sharing, and the company budget which also affects MY salary increase potentials.  Additionally, Picassos and other famous works of art are timeless and have been around for hundreds of years.  There's plenty of abstract value to famous paintings.  Also keep in mind, that those works of art were essentially junk when the artists were alive.  Not to mention those art were done by HAND by skill artists who labored hours on end, not some mass produced goop from a machine, much like the piece of glass we received.  Just how do you compare a priceless piece of art to a piece of glass from any modern day department store?  Oh I know!  It's like comparing apples and oranges isn't it?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">10-01-03, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see no contradiction in my calling a spade a spade.  You are making a value judgment about someone for something as trivial as their tastes in art.  It's sad and it's pathetic.  Your earlier post had nothing to do with profit sharing and you shouldn't try to back up your earlier comments with it (see Apples v. Oranges 2003).  <br />
<br />
Would she still have been a hick if your company had given her a Picaso?  Your justification of your outrage would imply so.  It wasn't the fact that she liked art you didn't like, it was that your company spent money on something that wasn't for you that made her a hick, right?  <br />
<br />
You can pretend to be angry about how those gifts probably shaved 5 cents off your profit sharing if you'd like, but no one believes you.  The bottom line is that you are being small minded and petty, and people are calling you out on it.  This isn't the first time you've made some outrageous claim about how people who like different gifts than you are somewhat less than you and then tried to come up with some justification to mean that you didn't mean it when called to task on it.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...</div></div><hr />
