<br />
Better as in story but esp battles...</div></div><hr />

<br />
She is pretty much worthless :P...think in like 20 maybe less episodes is my fav fight scene :).<br />
<br />
Jeez now i know how stalk feels lol...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">12-31-05, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sakura is the chick Shinji of ninja. Totally worthless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come on now, she's not THAT worthless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She is that worthless :P...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for whether or not Naruto gets better, the Naruto fight you're about to see in the bridge against Haku is about the best it gets, disregarding the Rock Lee fight.<br />
<br />
In terms of story, it stays somewhat okay.. decent for a shounen, at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synrax</div><div class="date">12-31-05, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sakura makes for good hentai fan drawings!</div></div><hr />

So that gives me something to look forward to circa 2010, if CN doesn't run very many reruns.  Good thing I've got a Tivo.<br />
<br />
Oh well, for the next couple months anyway I can squint a bit and pretend Motoko Kusangi has shown up a couple hours early for her GitS gig and is busy kicking ass and not for a moment fawning over any brooding pretty boys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well i was saying atm she is very worthless...didnt want to give anything away :P...<br />
<br />
And I think Rock Lee fight was about the best as it gets....maybe until...nm :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tabbran</div><div class="date">12-31-05, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Episode 34.<br />
<br />
It was that memorable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">12-31-05, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sakura is the complete poster child for useless character.  Naruto doesn't have any non-combatant main characters like most anime, so they made of the so-called fighters absolutely suck.<br />
<br />
But yeah, by the end of today one of the better fights in the show will have been shown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">12-31-05, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">never watched the dub but just saw this and turned it on to check it out... man this is bad. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanar</div><div class="date">01-01-06, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That kind of sucked guys. I want 2 hours of my life back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-01-06, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What two hours did you watch?  The last two?  And you thought it sucked?  Oh well, guess you're just hopelessly insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">01-01-06, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two hours of dubbed Naruto would have to be the best 4 episodes in a row to be worth watching. Which it wasn't. So it did indeed suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">01-01-06, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow.  Watching Naruto dubbed is...odd.  It's just not the same if he's not going, &quot;Ano sa, ano sa!&quot; all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im waiting for the DvD so i can pick not to hear it english dubbed :P...<br />
<br />
Oh and the awesomeness of all episodes has to be when they hit the exams...you will know when :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkOmen42</div><div class="date">01-01-06, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was ok, but it hardcore reminded me of why I almost always hate anime on TV. They put so much filler crap into the beginning and end you only get 15 real minutes of the episode. That's probably one of the big reasons I've never really gotten into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you're watching the wrong shows...? It's not as though it's a problem that plagues all of anime. Just the ones you watch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkOmen42</div><div class="date">01-01-06, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which is why I almost never watch it, and said, on tv.</div></div><hr />

What would that be?:poke</div></div><hr />

<br />
Robot Chicken of course!<br />
<br />
Oh yea, and some other shows they brought back, Family Person and Furtureramamamama I think. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-01-06, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find Harvey Birdman to be borderline hysterical also.<br />
<br />
And FMA and GITS are decent animes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulstealer</div><div class="date">01-02-06, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Birdman is quite possibly the funniest thing ever animated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Captain Planet</div><div class="date">01-02-06, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When will i be recognized with a marathon of my show on cn?  Thats all I ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-02-06, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When they decide to do a marathon of complete crap?<br />
<br />
Oh wait, they already did a 12oz Mouse marathon!</div></div><hr />
