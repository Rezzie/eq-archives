<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cirrion</div><div class="date">05-13-01, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings all, this is my first post to these boards, though I have long been a lurker.<br />
<br />
I am currently involved in a rather serious discussion with my Guild with regards to immortal healing and the ethics behind it.  I am of the opinion that it is under no situation acceptable to Immortal heal, while others in my Guild believe that it is acceptable as long as it is a Guildie that they are helping.<br />
<br />
The incident that spawned this discussion involved a PvP encounter with a number of pure teamers and a member of my guild (a lightie x-teaming guild) who refused to LnS after being slain.  To make a long story short, the discussion has now boiled down to an argument as to whether attacking a person who has refused to LnS is considered harassment, and whether immortal healing is acceptable behavior.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was just looking for other opinions on the subject, am I being disloyal to my guild or are they exploiting the system?  I also remember a post with a link to a log of a discussion between members of the Shanks and a GM with regards to a similar situation, where the GM affirmed the right of the Shanks to continue to PK this individual if he continued to refuse to LnS.  Unfortunately, I am unable to find this log on either the Safehouse or the Shanks website, if anyone has the link then I would appreciate if they could post it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />
<br />
/em wishes Verant would implement consistent PvP rules.<br />
