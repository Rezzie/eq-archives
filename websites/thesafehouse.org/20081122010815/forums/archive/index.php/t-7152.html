I was thinking I'd try to help him out at bit. So I was wondering what would be some decent pally gear that can be obtained solo by a 45 rogue solo or costs under 200p on a pvp server (alot of stuff is more expensive here), doesn't have to be good by todays standards because I want him to be able to upgrade himself soon and learn what getting stuff for himself is all about, thanks</div></div><hr />
