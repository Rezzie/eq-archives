The problem I'm having is that one of the people in the campaign is dying to use a character that is simply to powerful.<br />
The character was created and run in another campaign with a DM that loved to hand out magic items like they're candy, and has a penchant for turning PCs into.. things.<br />
So, this character, which had been an atypical lawful good monk, somehow got cursed into being a vampire.<br />
I don't want to just simply flat out refuse to let him use the character, but I need to reign his character in greatly.<br />
He's got skills from monk/shadowdancer/vampire currently, if i recall correctly.<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the problem the character's inherent power as a monk/shadowdancer/vampire, or is it that he has too many magic items?  Or a little of each?<br />
<br />
And is the player in question a reasonable one, who will work with you on making the character fit in your campaign world, or is he the kind who considers his character (and his character's posessions) to be inviolably holy, and would resent any modification by fiat before play, or modification by somewhat targeted events during play?</div></div><hr />

I hate cleaning up other GM's ubers when they want to come to game. With 2e, it's not a big problem, power = magic items + level. In 3.5e, you have feats and prestige classes that let people do all sorts of sick things.....but you can't take those from them like you can a simple +5 Sunblade of Blood-drinking-Defense. Good GMs can work power deprivation into the game, rust monsters, thieves, mysterious draining of magic, whatever, but you can't take feats and prestige abilities, it's like stealing xp from players. I guess if you really wanted to, knock him back a few levels, i.e. he loses the bonus feats, i.e. he misses the pre-reqs for certain feats and prestige classes, so he'll be less powerful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having a PC vampire is the worst idea ever though. Nothing short of a total undead party ever makes that work. Have them re-roll, my best suggestion.  &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;<br />

no more monk levels   I'd also rule that it messes with many of his abilities, since he's undead and no longer has the whole ki channeling thing going on ;P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not always. I have seen a character play a lawful good vampire and do it WELL. Basically this characters history was RPed well enough to show that his indomitable will was enough to fight back the evil and choatic tendancies. Because of this our GM allowed him to skip the alignment change, although the fact that he was forced to drink blood did weigh on his consience constantly and he had to deal with it.<br />
<br />
It all depends on a number of factors.<br />
<br />
1) Is it his gear that makes him too powerful?<br />
<br />
If so, take some of it away. Even before the game begins. Whatever event brings this character to meet the rest of the party could strip him of his items. Be it a magical portal the moves only flesh, or if he was captured and the  group rescued his naked body with nothing else. There are many ways to separate a player from his stuff.<br />
<br />
2) Is it the vampirsm that makes him too powerful?<br />
<br />
Use it against him. Have them be attacked constantly during the day and have people hate him even if he tries to be 'good'. Have a local vampire hunter find out about him a decide to add him to his trophy list. These are things called 'story hooks'. I use them a lot to remind 'special' characters that they are special.<br />
<br />
3) Is it his level or EL that makes him too powerful?<br />
<br />
Here, the player has to know that the game is set for a specific level. Figure up his EL (vampire level + class levels) and let him know that he can only keep x number of levels.<br />
<br />
Hope this has been helpful. Personally I enjoy running high level / high power games myself, and I have learned that there are many 'tricks' to control powerful characters.<br />
<br />
Ask me sometime about my campaign that consisted of 4 34th level characters, each paragons of thier race, gifted with deific power. Now THAT was a power trip.<br />

<br />
You could tell him that much of the campaign will take place during the day and a vampire would not fit.<br />
You could put a vampire hunter twice his level on his tail, he be making a new character soon because it seems like he's the type that dosn't know how to play a vamp-in-hiding.\<br />
Have a wandering cleric find him when he's sleeping and cast ressurection on him.  <br />
Maybe you could say your campaign world looses its connection with the negetive material plane for a short peroid of time, write it into the history of the world.  Or better yet, they 'tunnel' the brought him to this world cause its to be severed.  If he looses his connection to the plane he dies.  Then the place he arrives conviently is a temple where the clerics bring him back because they have a prophecy that he's supposed to be a great hero or something.  That same tunnel would turn all of his magic items mundane.  &quot;See this, its my quarterstaff of fireballs. Watch this 'Fireball!'&quot; &amp;lt;nothing happens&gt; &quot;Ya right 'Staff of fireballs'.  Thats a good one&quot;</div></div><hr />

Adjust the other characters' level upwards, or adjust the vampire's level downwards, and explain to him why this is done - being a vampire = high EL, end of story.<br />
<br />
secondly, why do DMs hate character power?  I mean, isn't that the goal of the player - to amass power so that his character can't be killed by those who wish to do him harm?  Sure, once the player gets a +187 sword of own, he can walk all over all the NPCs you had ready to thwart him - because that's exactly what would happen if that PC got a powerful weapon anyway!  Just give the PCs more powerful enemies to fight, and make sure there's an in-game reason - great warriors from another realm or plane have heard about the power of overpwered_character01 and are coming to test his might.  Chances are, if one character's overpowered enough for the party to start fighting too difficult opponents, the rest of the party will start resenting this person!  Always try to get the players to do your work for you.  And if they stick together and manage to defeat the monsters despite your efforts - hooray players!

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-18-03, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uh oh, time to get all theoretical on your azz.  <br />
<br />
People play games like D&amp;amp;D to primarily, yes, build power for themselves. But note, it's about building power, not getting it. For a character to walk into a new game with an old, stacked character, what does that do to the rest of the party? Think, the lvl 9 thief reminisces about that time he fell into the pit trap of sleeping black widows, and almost blew his MS/HIS roll trying to sneak out. But he did find his +3/type-e poison short sword down there! Or the level 10 Paladin, who remembers volunteering to be geased so the temple would ressurect a fallen comrade. Little did he know it would end up in him becoming a semi-avatar of his god, including his ultra-special deific armor and weapons! <br />
<br />
Building power is supposed to give players something to remember, it gives their character's history, personality, and it creates a sense value in the levels they have and the equipment they get. What is worth more to you? Getting a +3 Longsword of the body of an ogre you guys killed(among the 8 total you encountered), or getting that +3 longsword after exploring the depths of the catacombs, slaying the guardian, and solving the puzzle? Dumping a character into the world that has stuff and powers you didn't give him leaves him only with the memorys and appreciation for his stuff that he got in someone else's game, under someone else's ideas.<br />
<br />
Maybe that doesn't strike you as bad, but again, consider this. That paladin that has been in your world for a year and a half, he is used to policing himself and his actions because he status and position rely on his good or &quot;in-character&quot; behavior. So he won't be threatening NPCs to make the plot move using his powers, he won't bash down the walls of the legal merchant to see the map he has hidden in the shop, he won't just slaughter NPCs out of character and on a whim, he has things to lose and he knows how they will be lost.<br />
<br />
The flip side, an example from RL. Back in the day, we all used to make PCs based on video game heros. Well, one player had Ryu, the monk. And he wanted to bring him to an admittedly, more mature and developed campaign. ALL other eastern classes in that game were very, very cautious when thinking about their actions, their impact on their status with their sensei, and their dojos, clans, associations, was at the forefront of their self-policing. The monk comes in, gets a level or two, loses 3/4 of his magic items, gets assigned a dojo and a master, blah blah blah. The first game we play, we are talking to a noble daiymo, and the monk tries to @#%$ strong arm him, right there! When the guards come, and we are all explaining to him that his sensei will disown him, he will be a fugitive in the land, ect... And he just shrugs, because his character has no value to him, he hasn't worked for what he has gotten, it's about the numbers on paper not the being in his imagination. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I totally don' disagree that the game is about acquiring power. But with great power . Giving power to players must always be balanced against risk to the players, and responsibilities. Give a player an aritifact with great power and no strings attached, and the first thing that player will do is abuse it as much as they can imagine, forcing you to put the smack down on them. Even though someone is transfering over a character in this case, it's from a different game. That player is essentially being given a new character, with a big shiny artifact, and no restraints or cost. <br />
<br />
It's like gambling. When you've won $2000 after losing $400 dollars to get there, you eye your money and weigh the risks of gambling it. If you walk into the casino, and someone just gives you $2000, you go buck nutty! It's not &quot;your&quot; money in the sense you had no risk in it, so you behave differently with it. <br />

Forgive me, but that's not a consequence of his starting character level, it's a starting consequence of someone not caring about the game.

Quote:Give a player an aritifact with great power and no strings attached, and the first thing that player will do is abuse it as much as they can imagine, forcing you to put the smack down on them. Well, ideally, the world should punish your players for their actions, not you as the DM - if the players do something unconscionable, have the local justice system try to punish them for it - if the players stomp all over the posse sent to capture them, the magistrate can hire a hero from another town.  If the players defeat the hero, other heroes will get wind of things, and the players will have to face more and more powerful adversaries that pursue them.  And, if they defeat everything they face - well, that sounds like a pretty awesome campaign to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, based on level alone, no. But levels, power, items, all of that, jumping into a game with all the big guns, players are more apt to take it less seriously, they haven't worked for it. <br />

<br />
Same difference in what I said. DMs have to decide to send the posse out. That's putting the smack down. That's the world putting the smack down. I see PCs like one branch of the criminal justice system sees crime, you're more likely to offend than play by the rules. I see players as more likely to use their abilities and powers recklessly than constructively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, but that sounds like an attitude that is going to make for a frustrating game for everyone involved.  As a DM, I always try to cater to the players, and let them play the game they want - but my NPCs never pull punches and if the PCs run afoul of a big nasty, they get both barrels without hesitation.  PCs are much too resourceful to do otherwise, and fighting a relentless, implacable enemy is much more entertaining than &quot;killing monsters&quot;.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver<br />

<br />
Slow down there cochees. I didn't say a single word of that. But I assume the worst in player behavior. Players deciding how to act in a situation is all part of the game. That doesn't mean some of their behavior isn't destructive to the game. If it's part of the story, they can damn well do what they please. If they are ruining the story, for everyone else, and for me, it's bad gaming. That's what I seek to avoid. And I prep to have my bases covered against PCs going over the top or running wild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quote:If it's part of the story, they can damn well do what they please. If they are ruining the story, for everyone else, and for me, it's bad gaming.See, this is what I don't understand - trying to confine PC behavior to a pre-set &quot;story&quot; seems like extreme metagaming to me.  In most of the best games I've played, the DM gives you a hook, and you can either go with it, or pursue your group's own goals - the DM either scraps the storyline he had set up or saves it for a later time, and improvises a new one.  This reinforces the idea that the PCs are in a living world, wherein they are in control of where they go and what they do, with the DM controlling only the world, not the game.  That is what I meant when I said, 'The world should punish the players, not the DM'.  <br />
<br />
Quote:And I prep to have my bases covered against PCs going over the top or running wild. Again, I fail to understand why either of these is a bad thing.  Doesn't your world have characters that go over the top and run wild that are NPCs?  And, usually, aren't these villains?<br />
<br />
This is the difference between a scenario and a game world - in a scenario, bad guys sit in their rooms and wait for the PCs to come and defeat them.  In a game world, events transpire however they would have transpired normally, save for the disruption of events by the PCs (which is the whole point of the PCs' game experience).  Our DM actually encouraged us to do whatever we wanted, whether it was running amok, slaughtering his favorite NPCs, destroying whole towns, whatever we wanted - but he always made sure there were consequences to ANYTHING we did, good or bad, so that we would regulate our behavior based upon not whether or not we were doing what he wanted us to, but rather upon what we were doing was (a) in character and (b) sensible.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Example(a real one): PCs walk up to this door in the side of the mountain. All of them were drawn there by mysterious circumstances. The door is made of black metal, and has corrosion marks all over it, black bubbles made of corroded metal, the door breathes in and out like it is alive. The PCs are gathered, trying to decide how best to approach it, when one PC(a player who is impatient and hates to communicate) runs up and smashes the door with his hammer, ignoring the cries of the PCs(and the shouts of the people at the table). End result: 2 PCs dead, 2 more almost fatally injured.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another good one: PCs are in a town, trying to get permission to borrow a holy relic from the church in order to do something. The entire town is peace bonded(weapons are bound with wire and drawing them is a serious, jailable offense). Negotiations are not going well. One of the players, who hasn't been involved in any of the negotiations/interactions, decides he's going to go walk around town(he's playing a bi-polar banished elven prince who is more than slightly unbalanced). While walking around, he decides he's going to teach a boy he meets how to sword fight! Using his peace bound sword, he starts instructing the kid where the kill points are ect....Then a guard comes up. The PC takes the bound sword, and starts motioning the guard's neck and crotch with it. The guard gets angry, tells him to desist or he's going to jail. All he had to do was put the sword down, and walk away. The PC ignores him completely, goes to jail, instead. <br />
<br />
The next two hours involved one PC trying to create a legal defense for the other at his court appearance, and the wizard breaking into the temple of the most powerful deity in the world to rescue the captured PC, making us all criminals, forcing us all to flee, almost making us kill innocent guards. To rectify the situation, we had to strong arm the dm into letting us kill the offending party members, present them to the court as proof of their punishment, then resurrecting them so we could continue on.<br />
<br />
A whole night of adventuring, fux0rd, because one player decided to 'do his own thing', forcing a reaction out of the world, while me and 2 other players who had no intentions on being fugitives or law breakers, sat there bored for the whole night while all this insanity went on.  <br />
<br />
<br />
That is about as good an example of desructive gaming I can think of. If our whole party had been behind the jail break, it would have been an adventure. Instead, it turned into 2 PCs who like to make trouble into center stage attractions for the whole night, while the rest of us LG, LN players just sat there going &quot;PUT THE @#%$ SWORD DOWN SO WE CAN GET ON WITH THIS&quot;.</div></div><hr />

That's just about all the input i have in this thread!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same DMing tatic.  I cant seem to get it to work right with any game except Shadowrun though.    Dont know what it is but I have people Rave over my Shadowrun campaigns.  My D&amp;amp;D campaigns always end up 'blah' by half way through.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, I love the Shadowrun setting.  But theres only so many times that you can do a type of run before it gets old.  I really started mixing things up once and the campaign got massive. One player ended up as a mafia don, played it all out.  Then he ended up marrying his female bodyguard.  Since they still wanted to play I had quite a storyline going with her as well.  Not to mention their frequent encounters with the Yak.  And the smuggling ring that was going on in the background that they had a slight part of.  Plus his political connections that they had to keep up and going.  Their matrix buddies that were taking on the &amp;lt;Renraku&gt; Archology Rogue AI.  There just wasnt a good stopping point because there was so many storylines going on.  The campaign took up a life of its own, I never really had to setup any sort of adventure. Just had the NPC's react to what was going on.  Was really fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My group is an odd mix. I've got one rock solid player who loves to play a concept, likes to think about plot lines, likes to talk to his party. I have one gamer who has been my buddy since the days of Ninja Gaiden and Final Fantasy who admittedly, likes to play because he likes power, likes killing stuff, likes rolling dice. Most of the other players fall in the middle of those two(their brothers, actually  ). I can appreciate both of their play styles, but it puts me under a lot of stress as a DM #1 to keep everyone intrested in their own way and #2 deal with the various ways in which they are going to try and solve a situation. The former PC likes to explore, understand, within his character concept. The latter, prefers to meta-game somewhat, get some information, and make a decision based on his gut(not his characters) which is uselessly, go kick the bad guy's ass. <br />
<br />
In an intresting plot line, they all usually are on the same page. But when someone gets bored, or a unique situation presents itself(the lord of the castle has been wounded in a practice duel, and he doesn't want you to heal him! Quick, web the corridor so he can't escape! NO! Call his guards to restrain him because he is beside himself! NO! Let him go, he's Lord of his bloody castle! NO! Everyone fall back and let me tail him to see what he's doing! NO! He's a vampyre, that's why he doesn't want standard clerical healing, kill him!!!!!), the disparities in play styles becomes very apparent. <br />
<br />
For me as a DM, I have to think very carefully about how I lay out situations with my PCs, because there is honestly never any telling how the party as a whole is going to take it, or how an individual PC is going to try to deal with. What makes matters worse is(and is my biggest player pet peeve) that most of my PCs are the &quot;say it in character first then talk about it with the players later&quot;. Table talk about the plot is something I encourage. It may not be realistic for the characters themselves to talk about it together, but that shouldnt' stop PCs from using their brains. And if they talk about it, and people still act on purely character motivations, well, then the party and I have done all that can be done, and if it goes south, it goes south. It's the abscence of that chance to talk things over that concern the whole party that really pisses me off. <br />
<br />
So if I come off a little........heavy handed with my games, it's because it's been my experience that a session can be moving along nicely one minute, and collapse into players pissed off at each other and the situation, in the space of getting up to get a Mtn. Dew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have a GM here that gets rather heavy handed with the 'table chat'.  (Some of you may remember him from a previous story, he's the guy that put us in the pit and didnt let us out)<br />
<br />
We were playing some StarWars the other day and the captian was on the comm with the imperial star destroyer.  (We were getting permisson to land on the planet, we were rebels going to retreive a downed pod and using &quot;visiting family&quot; as our cover.)  He tells the guy on the other end of the comm &quot;We have a passanger that is visiting reletives.&quot; then turns to the group and says &quot;That's what we were going to tell them right?&quot;<br />
GM takes it as his character saying that to us sitting there in the cockpit while he has an open channel.  So things get abit rough.<br />
Then later we were talking to an NPC asking him some questions.  We got all our questions answered and started to talk amongst ourselves in a farily &quot;Party Private&quot; conversation.  (Ya, lets just tell everyone that were here retreiving some sensitive rebellion information during an imperial occupation)  and the GM takes it that were standing in front of this guy talking.  More chaos ensues.<br />
<br />
Sometimes this guy runs games that are alright, but its nights like this that he turns out as a real 'pick GM'.  Ends up more of a stress generator than a fun time.  And theres not talking with him about it either.  &quot;What do you think im just going to give you everything?&quot;<br />
Im not talking about assuming a rogue is sneaking in a dangerous enviroment either.  Im talking about simple things.  Like assuming that table chatter is just that.  One of our players is known for babbling on about things unrelated to the game.  So were flying through hyperspace and the captian starts talking about something that happened to his SWG character.  As far as the GM's concerned his Star Wars character plays Star Wars Galaxies.</div></div><hr />

I'm forced to agree with Llabak - it sounds like your players simply don't want to cooperate.  I'm familiar with this and I've run into it plenty of times in my own gaming group - the answer is, DON'T TRY TO CATER YOUR CAMPAIGN TOWARDS YOUR PLAYERS.  Run the game world, and make it clear the progress of events is in their hands - if they end up arguing amongst themselves and a party-on-party war ensues, and they don't have a lot of fun with the campaign because of it, guess what - it's THEIR fault!  As long as you simply run the campaign and don't get involved, they can't blame you, and the game goes on.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver<br />

My favorite tactic for reigning in people who actively FSU is to get everyone on the same page as far as playing their character in character. If someone acts like a psycho upstart who's always in trouble with the law, chars shouldn't have to bail them out unless they actually want to. (And L-anything chars may not enjoy adventuring with them at all.) They'll either learn that they can't just ignore the party's wishes and expect to always be bailed out during play, or they'll learn it in jail while the party goes on to actually adventure. Saving that kind of person's butt all the time only teaches them they can behave like a tool and never worry about it.*<br />
<br />
One of my favorite &quot;people actually play in character?!&quot; moments: The party was going.. somewhere. A river was in the way. On the shore, an old man was sleeping in a fishing boat. When the party woke him up, he was belligerent and refused to let them borrow his boat. Instead of either trying to haggle or just moving on to try to find another way, one of the players started trying to just take the boat. The old man fought him as effectively as a feeb can fight, and the player responded in the manner of an experienced rollplayer - lethal force. Instead of sighing with relief and getting in the boat, or simply complaining, the very Good oriented party subdued him, turned him in to the city watch for murder, and then continued on the adventure.</div></div><hr />
