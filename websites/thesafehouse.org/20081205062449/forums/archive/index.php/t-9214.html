<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes there is! If you have someone in your group selected, you'll automatically find your attacks hit who they have targeted, but if you cast a healing/buff it goes on your teamate. It's very very easy to use. Makes being group healer so much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although, you may not want to assist the main tank.<br />
<br />
In EQ, The Main tank tends to stay on one target for a long time, until they are dead.<br />
<br />
In COH, the Main tank's job in groups is not damage, but Taunting. Thus, they will be rapidly switching targets to taunt anyone who has turned his attention to the squishies. (Defenders/Controllers/Blasters)<br />
<br />
If you have a secondary tank or a Scrapper, it may be more effective to target them instead. They will likely not be switching targets as rapidly, and will stay on one target until it is down.<br />
<br />
Doing this gives you much better odds of avoiding aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would love the ability to F1-F6 select group members (or some other key binding)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can target your group members using SHFT-1, 2, 3, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This assist is the best way to save the blaster, scraper, controllers in the group.  When you notice them getting pounded just target and slam taunt, no more ouchies.  Doesn't work so well for defenders since they mostly have group members targeted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, Alturick, you can bind any keys that you want to quickly target group members. For example, if you wanted it to be F1 - Fwhatever, you would use the following command:<br />
<br />
/bind f1 &quot;team_select 1&quot;<br />
/bind f2 &quot;team_select 2&quot; <br />
etc. etc.<br />
<br />
However, I'm not sure if binding the F-keys to targetting will also use your inspirations in the case of F1 through F5... Although I doubt that. However, if you still want to be able to use your keyboard to use inspirations, the commands are as follows:<br />
<br />
Assuming you want to use Y through P to use them:<br />
<br />
/bind y &quot;inspexec_slot 1&quot;<br />
/bind u &quot;inspexec_slot 2&quot; <br />
etc. etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, your default binds (inspirations) will be replaced by your new binds.<br />

<br />
Now, alas, the citizens of Paragon City must struggle without me for the weekend as I will be in DC.  Tiggie, Hedgehog of Justice will be back to fight another day! :)<br />
<br />
Have a good weekend. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-23-04, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TBH, I found assist to be a PITA in this game.<br />
<br />
I have to &quot;aim&quot;/move to the target myself, sticking to the Main Assist won't do, so I have to check what target it is anyhow - I'd rather just see what he is attacking and attack it myself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah ha.... shift+#<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks yall.. that helps a lot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalaks Kostaja</div><div class="date">06-02-04, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya thanks for the shift+# notation =).<br />
<br />
Btw does anyone know how to remove unnecessary binds. I mean simply remove them, I know rebinding it makes the old one go away, but I wan't it be removed entirely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kal / Q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">06-02-04, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/bind &amp;lt;KEY&gt; nop<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This will clear all binds for your key (aside from some default ones).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">06-02-04, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just do /bind c &quot; &quot; or whatever, to get rid of annoying binds that I hit too much when I forget to hit enter. Am I the only one who notices a significant increase in typos while playing the game though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">06-02-04, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. Much faster pace than EQ, and without autoattack, you end up typing super-mega-hyper-fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">06-02-04, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really Meddik.... think about the den of rogues your talking too ;)<br />
<br />
We're used to typing in short sentences :)<br />
<br />
---- <br />
Besides, you can ask Wix... I rarely type while grouped... usually on the phone with my other groupmates in CoH heh. (This didnt apply when I was still playing EQ, and I actually got quite good at my typing skills because of it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mony</div><div class="date">06-03-04, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speeaking of typos and typing fast... does anyone know of a way to abort a whole line of text other than by hitting return or hitting backspace 4925745 times?  I find myself in the middle of typing replies to stuff in team and then suddenly having to stop for a fight, but haven't found a good way to dump all the text at once without sending it to everyone in whatever the current, incomplete form is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">06-03-04, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hit escape 1 time, it chlears the line but leaves you in chat mode. (The char bar is highlighted, and any new text will go into it)<br />
<br />
Hit escape a second time, and it takes you out of chat mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">06-03-04, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I found that if you're in chat mode, just hitting shift-up gives you the last line of text you typed, seems like there's a buffer there you can go through.  Nice if you're trying to figure out a bind thingie and you munge it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pimpsareus</div><div class="date">06-03-04, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the esc thing, Meddik. Can't count how many times i left on auto-run to type something and ran into some unwanted trouble. I thought i had to backspace through the whole thing to be able to change course and escape. In EQ you could still move while in chat mode so it wasnt a problem.  =(</div></div><hr />
