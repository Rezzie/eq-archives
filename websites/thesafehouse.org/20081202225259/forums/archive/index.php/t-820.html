Nice. Soldiers who fail drug tests still get sent to Iraq<br />
to risk their lives; then they get dishonorably discharged<br />
after their tour.</div></div><hr />

Bush has things to answer for, but this is not one of them.  It was, however, stupid to send them anyway.  Put them straight into a military prison for drug offenses, and conduct unbecoming.  If they can actually prove they tried to sidestep the deployment via the drugs, then also get them for dereliction of duty.</div></div><hr />

It's just one of those &quot;@#%$ happens&quot; things. It was kind of dumb on their part, and while it sucks and you can feel bad for them...<br />
<br />
Just to set the record clear. There are a lot of documented cases of war crime activites by US soldiers in Vietnam. They were all delt with according to the code of military justice. I'm not personally aware of any cases that were described in that article, most of it was stuff like a commanding officer getting sick of VC attacks coming from a vilage they were protecting and just machinegunning the whole village. War crime, hell yes, but you gotta feel something for the guy when his troops are dieing and there's not a damn thing he can do about it. Anyway, not sticking up for Kerry.

However, if they showed no evidence of their drug use while in the military, why should they be punished afterward? They served their country honorably regardless of what they did in their personal time before being accepted. And I don't believe them for a second when they say that they didn't tell the soldiers because they didn't have time before deployment.</div></div><hr />

Like it or not, part of your duties in the military include following certain rules.  Becoming a soldier changes your rights from those of a civilian to those of a soldier.  In the military certain standards are imposed that are higher than those standards of civilian society.<br />
<br />
Processing someone out of the military for a drug discharge can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months or even longer.  I promise you, just because you are in the process of being discharged, does not stop you from having to perform your duties.  If one of those duties happens to be a deployment, guess where you are going.<br />
<br />
The fastest discharge from the military happens to be medical, I'vs seen people get medical discharges, and the processing only take a months time.</div></div><hr />

california (where it is legal)...which has including handcuffing  geriatric parapalegics to their beds....you'll have to forgive me if I put some blame on Bush's policies for how the feds treat those who may use other drugs than alcohol. But I wasn't<br />

Unless things have changed, possession of narcotics is a violation of state law, not federal law.  It only breaks federal law to transport controlled substances over state lines.  If California legalizes medical marijuana, then the it doesn't conflict with national law if the marijuana is grown in-state.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just gotta say this. And no, I am not a user. What sucks about drug use is that the social stigma that follows it even for casual use. There are so many people in prominent positions who use drugs of many types and nothing is done, but if the &quot;average joe&quot; is caught with or using a small portion of marijuana a large portion of their life is screwed up in one way or another. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, bus drivers, politicians; I would not be at all surprised to hear that large numbers of these are drug users. I've been very surprised to hear that some people I know are/were users. These have been workmates, parents of some of my friends, and business contacts and others. <br />
<br />
  I don't agree with legalization, or with social use of drugs, but what I do have a problem with is the law being harsher on others because of their circumstances outside of the drug use. In the military, it is somewhat hard to avoid, since they are under the orders of a higher authority. But still, deliberately (if it is deliberate) asking someone to risk their lives for nothing just because of a slight wrong they committed is wrong. Especially when other &quot;exemplaries&quot; in society are often just as guilty.<br />
<br />
   I dont think that legalization is the key, but rather, more compassion with our lawmaking entities. Perhaps to realise that laws DO affect different people in very different ways.  And please don't anyone give me the &quot;your vote counts&quot; crap, or &quot;write a congressman.&quot; Some laws hurt a certain demographys more than others, especially drug laws. <br />
<br />
   Not saying that this is the case here, but it's something to think about. I just can name too many &quot;responsible&quot; people I've heard say something along the lines of &quot;I just like to go smoke a joint every now and then...&quot; Man that makes me sick to hear when I know other people are getting busted for the same thing.

Quote:deny soldiers the right to vote<br />
<br />
Disregarding the fact that it's all about politics and voter fraud is massive on both sides of the issues, I figure it's more understandable to throw out votes that were put in incorrectly, rather than using pushpolling or fliers to confuse and outright misinform voters so that their votes aren't pushed in right.  Even less so than taking voters off the rolls simply because of the color of their skin.<br />
<br />
Quote: accusing US soldiers of comitting war crimes and atrocities<br />
<br />
If you read the article, it says Kerry relied on the Winter Soldier Investigation.  But when was that proven false?  All you really have him guilty of is using something once thought accurate, but much later proven inaccurate.  At the time, was it known to be inaccurate?  And maybe he had seen war crimes himself but didn't feel right in ratting on fellow soldiers.  Also, the other part that article talks about, gets into what you believe the war on communism was about.  To me, it was about continuing economic slavery to the U.S. and repressing democracy in countries where their democracy doesn't agree with us.  But that's a different debate.<br />
<br />
Quote:ignoring terrorist attacks against US servicemen.<br />
<br />
Where in that site does it indicate Clinton ignored the attacks?  All I see is he didn't bomb everyone.  Although, if you remember, Clinton did have a plan formulated to destroy al-Qaeda, passing it on to the Bush administration and warning them of the dangers of al-Qaeda, Clinton just didn't have the resources to do it (it takes time to plan offensives, something Bush has hopefully learned in Iraq).  If anyone ignored those attacks, it was Bush, because they happened so late in Clinton's administration, and it took time to find out who was responsible.  It was Bush who had the opportunity and evidence required to respond to that.  It was Bush who completely ignored the danger.</div></div><hr />

So close, but you forgot some key wording.<br />
<br />
Add this after your &quot;All the people&quot;, and you can almost leave the rest in tact.<br />
<br />
All the people...<br />
<br />
who are in the military and have agreed to follow said rules, with the express understanding that should they not follow them, they will be discharged in some other than Honorable fashion,<br />
<br />
...who run stop signs or red lights, drive over the speed limit, j - walk, drink under the age of 21, or commit any crimes against our beloved and holiest of countries, etc...<br />
<br />
By signing up for service in the military, you express your willingness to follow those rules, and express your willingness to fight for this country no matter whether you believe the fight is correct or not.<br />
<br />
Just because you break the rules you agreed to when you signed up for the military, does not excuse you from your duties in the military, so yes, &quot;Sorry, you broke the rules, as soon as you return from your duties in Iraq, you'll be out of here.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sillis Spineslicer</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whether you think they should still be sent or not, from what I have read, everyone has missed one crucial issue.<br />
<br />
Other people in Iraq are depending on those malingerers to help protect their lives.  Their fellow soldiers.  The Iraqi citizens.  Would you really want a disgruntled drug user who knew he faced borderline criminal action when the tour was over protecting your back?<br />
<br />
I know I sure in the hell wouldn't.<br />
<br />
Would you want him doing maintenance on your F-16?  Packing your parachute?<br />
<br />
Nope.<br />
<br />
Doing night sentry duty?  Searching people for weapons?  Be responsible for stopping potential suicide bombers?<br />
<br />
No @#%$ way.<br />
<br />
Daton is right.  When you join the military you voluntarily suppress a large set of your rights.  One example is when you accept the privilege of the ability to enter a base, you give up all rights to refuse the search of your vehicle.  If you sneeze at the gate, or you pull down the sun visor while driving, you can be stopped and have your car searched.  <br />
<br />
However, the interdependence of soldiers in a combat zone on each other for protection should have been considered.  The idea that the deployment schedule didn't allow it is total BS.  They drop last minute notice on you all the time saying your deployment has been lengthened, sometimes by the original amount.<br />
<br />
This seems like pure retribution to me, and will do nothing for the already low morale most of the military body has right now.  Hey, your new SF/crew member/recon troop is already lined up for a dishonorable discharge when they get home.  But don't worry, he will still do the job!<br />
<br />
Normally they do not throw you in jail for a drug test failure, but in this case a jail term of the length of the deployment would have been a better idea.<br />
<br />
Just to let you know my wife is USAF (she just listed on the Major boards yesterday, /grats wifey   ), so I am not just completely talking out of my ass here.  Just a little bit  <br />
<br />
Would I want someone like that responsible for the care and protection of my wife?  Do I even need to answer that?</div></div><hr />

I am shocked at how many of you took Splendoras bait. It makes it tuff to enforce &quot;No Trolling&quot; rules when you all engage in it...<br />

Kids would suddenly become pacifists who joined for college money and had no idea being a soldier meant they might be put in harms way.<br />
<br />
I watched over a dozen people escape service in a combat zone by suddenly coming &quot;out&quot; and saying they were gay or by magically failing a drug test.  It was a joke.  People took the easy way out.<br />
<br />
So while I wouldn't want a drug user watching my back in a combat zone; I'm not so sure many of these folks are drug addicts.  Then again, I wouldn't want a coward watching my back either.<br />
<br />
How about failing the urine test before deployment is considered missing a movement for hazardous duty?  Then you could lock the twits up for 20 years and make sure folks knew it wasn't an easy escape from service.<br />

Don't matter which party is in power, they all sweep the problems under the rug.  I figure we got about 15 or so more years before they let everthing out about Agent Orange.  Some accountant will decide that the remaining possible claimants for damages is low enough to let the truth out.<br />
Till then they will let out dribs and drabs, deny Gulf War Syndrome, ect.</div></div><hr />

Do you really want the service men and women having to depend on someone who's going to be @#%$ after his tour no matter what he does as opposed to someone who knows if he does well he can get out with less losses?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Splendora</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I'd agree it should be one of two choices:<br />
<br />
a) discharge them right away; or<br />
<br />
b) if they serve without problems in Iraq, at least give them an honorable discharge or just forget about it if they test clean from now on.<br />
<br />
<br />
ps. meddik, yeah i know about federal vs state law; I did<br />
not comment on the fed / california thing because I was surprised by it; but because I thought it was lame. <br />
