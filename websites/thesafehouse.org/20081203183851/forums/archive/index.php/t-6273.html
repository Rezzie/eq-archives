<br />
.. SHADOWCROSS is taken on Victory :( **** **** **** **** **** If I ever get my hands on the person that took my identity. :(<br />
<br />
So, I settled for &quot;SX&quot; for the time being...<br />
<br />
Enter Paragon City...<br />
<br />
You have been forcefully disconnected from the server - Server shutting down!<br />
<br />
ARGH! **** **** ****</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be that the name was reserved, but never actually taken. I'm not sure when those name reservations expire.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one other little trick... If you really want to, you can name yourself &quot;Shadowcross &quot;<br />
<br />
Yep, everyone has to append a space when sending you a tell, but it does work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh. You too huh? Was doing my first ever group when I got forcibly ejected. I'm glad it wasn't just me though. :D<br />
<br />
You might be able to get Shadowcross as a name after the 15th if what Kroe says is true. Someone from beta may have reserved it across all servers, but if they don't claim it by then it's freed up. If you try to add that name as a friend and the game tells you there's no such name or they aren't online, that means there isn't really someone with that name yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good to know. I'd do quite a lot to get my name.. it's been my identity in RPGs and LARP for years now. :(<br />
<br />
Will test other servers besides Victory as soon as they come back up again - which is soon I hope.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to &quot;copy&quot; a setup for a hero to use it on different servers/chars? Or do I have to redo everything each time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you pretty much have to redo it on every server. But if you're just reserving the name, just hit the 'random' button and name it. :)<br />
<br />
Did you try it with a space in it, like: Shadow Cross?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadow Cross<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure I did try that one. Also tried &quot;ShadowCross&quot; in case it was case-sensitive.<br />
<br />
Dang, I want my name! *cry*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah not case sensitive, I know that much. You could always do the time honored/cringing method of adding extra letters to it, but it's just embarassing to go through life with names like 'Leggolasss' :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, so I just now scanned all servers (except for Triumph):<br />
<br />
Shadowcross added to friend list on Victory :(<br />
Shadowcross is mine on all others<br />
<br />
Triumph still down<br />
<br />
I really hope it was someone from here who reserved the name... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about 'Shadow X' or 'X-Shadow'?  In character creation in the chest detail section, there are straps that look like a big X which you could use.  Use a lot of black and dark colours on the rest of your costume and you're set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the easiest way right now to figure out if someone is using your name or if it's jsut reserved is to try to add the name to your friends list. <br />
<br />
For example on VIctory someone took &quot;coyote&quot; so I log on as &quot;the wiley coyote&quot; and try to add &quot;Coyote&quot; to my friends list. It gives me an error saying that person does not exist or is not online at the time. That means it doesn't exist, because you CAN add the name of people who are not currently online to your friends list. If you get that error message wait until the 15th when unmade character names are released on all the servers. I know I'm going to be trying to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we'l just keep spamming the shadowcross on victory beggin hi to give up the name. Maybe we can offer him phat lewt on an EQ server. I think I still have some elfhide gloves on Bristlebane. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if it has the word &quot;shadow&quot; in it, one of the ninjas is probably currently using it. <br />
<br />
it's the city of blasters and ninja.... and the hulk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, so today, he finally logs on... <br />
<br />
Level 9 scrapper, he got the idea for the name at the char creation - no association with the name at all. It's his main.<br />
<br />
I was just trying to talk with him about a deal - then he logged during our conversation, without any comment that he's logging. He didn't log back in either for the next hour.<br />
<br />
He didn't comment on giving up the name yet either. <br />
<br />
:(<br />
<br />
Guys, please keep him on your friend list - I'd love to talk to him again.. I'd give quite a lot to get my name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how many of us empathy freaks are there? we could bribe him wth some inspirations and old fashione dpowerleveling. Since healing doesn't get computed in for exp percentage it would be easy enough to send a pair of empathy defenders along with him and get him up to 9 again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldoren</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno if I'd harass him about the name, he might just get fed up and make his main some other character while keeping that name on the unused character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nobody harrassed him so far - he didn't even comment to me about the situation. He answered my questions and when I said I'd love to get my name back, and we would want to find a solution that suits both sides he logged without any further reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually just spotted the name thief in Steel Canyon, but the game shut down for a second 'daily maintenence' before I could say anything. Ugly costume. :)</div></div><hr />
