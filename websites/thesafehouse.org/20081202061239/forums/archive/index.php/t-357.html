<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-30-00, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the most incredible night over the weekend. For the first time ever I felt like a real rogue right out of an old AD&amp;amp;D game.<br />
<br />
This weekend my guild ran a raid on Najena for members around my level range. Around a dozen or so of us went on the raid and I was the only rogue. The goal was to take down Najena herself, and doing this required doing the entire dungeon from start to finish, due to a sequence of four keys needing to be obtained. These doors are not pickable at any skill level (grr), but as it turns out there are a large number of locked doors that are.<br />
<br />
The raid is going extremely well, but about halfway through, our group leader (a cleric in his 30's) takes a wrong turn and falls into a hidden trap in the floor, landing him in trapped in a locked prison cell surrounded by a group hostile spellcasting Dark Elves and ogres!<br />
<br />
As our leader was the only Rez capable person on our team, losing him would have delayed the raid if not runing it completely. No one had the key to these cells and time was something we didn't have.<br />
<br />
Time to get to work. While the group is fighting its way downstairs to get to him, I purposely take a dive after him through the trap. Catching the largest opponent with a backstab, I proceed to aggro the entire gang off of him and onto me, buying the cleric time to get some healing done.<br />
<br />
Then I spin and pop the lock behind me just as the rest of the group arrives (just in time to save my hash, of course). The calvary had arrived and finally regrouped we make short work out of the room with no lives lost.<br />
<br />
It turns out the entire section he fell into was filled with doors I could easily pick, and with me playing doorman, we took down a lot of neat stuff, including the Widowmistress and Najena herself at the end. Pretty much we killed the entire place at least once.<br />
<br />
My guild is fairly large and it did my heart proud to hear &quot;Thank God we brought Sabatini&quot; from so many people over guildsay. No one ever expected a rogue to be so needed. Not even myself!<br />
<br />
It felt incredible doing a dungeon from start to finish instead of camping a spot, and being so useful for my pure rogue skills was indescribable.<br />
<br />
So think carefully before ignoring that lockpicking completely. Never know when it might be useful...                                                                                                 27th Level Rogue on                  Prexus                                    &quot;There                  is no substitute for poor manners-except fast                  reflexes.&quot;                                     ~Steven Brust</div></div><hr />

It's great to be a rogue and be loved isn't it?  I sincerely wish we were on the same server...I think we'd kick some serious bad guy butt together.<br />

I've been raiding kaesora with one group, nobody else ever in there.. and it's real rogue work. scouting, pulling, you name it. In an unfamiliar dungeon, especially on lanys where we are the only group in the dungeon, a rogue is the groups most valuable asset!<br />
<br />
Its the best EQ ive ever played, real dungeoneering.. none of this camp a spawn cheeit. If you aint dived into a dungeon that you've never been into before, with no maps or other info, and nobody else in the zone.. my friends, then you aint seen your real power. Get a good party together and get to work!<br />
