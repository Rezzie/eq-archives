<br />
Being that I am guildless and am sick of AAing, I decided to do some quests left unfinished before.  I have completed up to 6th coldain ring.  Now I understand that I must kill a named  orc shammy in EW and give note on his body to Garadain.  My question is, I am 65, have about 3k HP unbuffed and somewhat ok weapons (APMB/Rage).  Can I do this solo?  Or will I need backup? I can round up a few of my friends but would prefer to save them for either 7th or 8th ring.  Any responce is appreciated.  Oh and here is my magelo, it does not show my charm but for reference it is: 8ac, 7str, 7dex, 5agi, 5sta, 45HP, 5 to all saves:<br />

I had a tank and cleric come help me, but I ended up assassinating him.<br />
<br />
Also, just practice general solo common sense - have SoW, use a DS potion, maybe use Bloodpoint, PoP poison (maybe Spine Rend then ID him), etc etc to maximize chance of success. Maybe grab some buffs in PoK before you go to spawn him (Aego, Focus, haste). And save your Disc for Nimble if you need to - sometimes bad rolls happen.</div></div><hr />

That way you don't need to worry about having people come there multiple times.<br />
<br />
I think you could solo him.  On most servers people can get almost raid buffed in PoK for 300pp.  I would just take a shaman or something with you so there are no &quot;what ifs&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_coruscare</div><div class="date">06-16-03, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you get him single it shouldn't be any problem.<br />
<br />
Get a SoW and an Aego/Virtue.<br />
<br />
Give 5th ring to Korrigan, follow Icefang across EW or just book it to the Orc Hut near the Iceclad bridge.<br />
<br />
Probably best bet is to sneak into the hut since you can't track to find out when they pop.<br />
<br />
Wait for the guy to pop, run out back, un-hide a fair ways off and slowly approach to hut.<br />
<br />
He will agro on you (hopefully before Icefang gets there).<br />
<br />
Back up a ways and take him down, shouldn't be too difficult.<br />
<br />
As a ranger I've done this 4-5 times solo, but the advantage of track and being able to root/snare off extra mobs make it a lot easier.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure you can get a line of sight on him to single-pull him with a bow.  If not, wait until the dog charges and gets agro, and them peel him off.<br />
<br />
(Personally, I find shaman and enchanter mobs the easiest to solo.)<br />
<br />
You'll need help for 7.  You can probably kill Warden Bruke.  I did at 63 with some lucky Instill Doubts.  Never could land a poison on him.  But for the follow-the-dwarf part, you'll need friends unless you want to try the monk trick and escape.</div></div><hr />
