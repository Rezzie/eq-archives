<br />
10 GOLD pieces and a cat's eye agate. <br />
<br />
Please!  Is this the best treasure that Mr. Miragul could muster?  The guy must be a crack-pot.  He mastered 4 different sorts of caster magic and he's hiding his belly-button lint in chests?   Edited by: Panamah at: 10/17/03 10:13 am</div></div><hr />

It was in the chest near the ZI at the room at the upper end of the loop.  I even had to camp to get it because the group was bugged saying we could not loot while a mob hated us. Soca<br />

I think the best chest i've found had a +5 dex in it.  oddly enough nobody was there to roll on it soo.. ( we finished the adventure and nobody wanted to bother with chests.. so i disarmed and opened it myself after everybody else had left)<br />

Its pure chance what you get.  I've seen too many chests explode in my face when I just look at them. NIL MORTIFI SINE LUCRE <br />
