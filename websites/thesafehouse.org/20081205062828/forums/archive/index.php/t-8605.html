<br />
Can anyone comment on the new faction-making and perhaps the angry goblin spawn?<br />
I wanna know if I should hurry and finish the quest before the rewamp goes live on all servers =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">07-01-03, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quest is still doable, angry goblin and goblin traitor are now in a cave in FM instead of Droga. (There are also about 20-30 goblins in that cave that can be killed for faction.)<br />
<br />
Droga is much harder now and Nurga is a bit harder also... skin and salt drops are rarer.  We ended up mostly AEing Nurga to get faction for the quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SincroFashad</div><div class="date">07-01-03, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are not on Test or Legends, then if you want to do this quest, get it done now.  At least, get the faction done now.<br />
<br />
I finally got off my duff last week, and went from max-KoS to max-ally in about 4 hard-core sessions in Droga.  Talking to people attempting to do the same thing on legends, it just completely sucks by comparison.  I was able to do all my work totally solo, maintaining roughly a 120/hour kill rate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">07-04-03, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent 2 days there, second day some afk ranger was sitting there.. I go ld for an hour... guess whose bot army got the angry goblin?<br />
<br />
grrr...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Burglar</div><div class="date">07-05-03, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt really have much problem with this quest...  simply grind through the faction... yes it will take some time but just get it done. After that when you need the angry goblin just sit down there with log on to catch any quest conversation if you can be there to watch... check back on log when someone triggered him, and be there for next spawn. If theres a patch soon its even easier. I managed to get it done even if some bot team had him timed... They couldnt be awake at the times i could i guess =) So i just gathered a few people and killed him (tried soloing but didnt have enough insta heal potions). There i was done with that. The sinew i bough from some guys who where farming spells at juggs...  gave em a valorium ring for lootright. and farmed crypt while waiting. Drusella took a few spawns... Either lost rolls, og people where just faster then me. But when she started to spawn at about 8 to 10 AM, she was all mine... If i couldnt get her, i logged her death and set alarm on my phone for her next spawn, and made sure to log out in HS... Got a couple of friends there and got the urn... The whole quest didnt take me too long. And if you just WANT it enough, you wont have problems either... (you might if you have a job you care about)</div></div><hr />

Dude, the quest is changing when they revamp droga and charasis. He's asking for current information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">07-06-03, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay, got angry goblin.  Had to steamroll a lowbie sk that I think I made quit EQ though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panternoir</div><div class="date">07-07-03, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, with the new revamp coming to all servers on July 9th and the angry gob spawning in the new cave in FM when you do the turn in where does the SK spawn that you need to kill?  In the same new small cave? If anyone from Test or Legends could answer I would really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">07-07-03, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skargus spawns in the same spot angry goblin does, when you turn in the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrion</div><div class="date">07-08-03, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone care to give a loc of the cave please? thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
woot, finally.....kunark fun once more!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Daard</div><div class="date">07-10-03, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in FM all morning with a druid. We searched the zone over while checking track, and we never found any sign of the angry goblin. We checked both the Burynai mines, and we circled the entire zone while constantly checking track.. Can anyone confirm if they actually changed FM with this patch? <br />
<br />
Droga was obviously changed, but it wouldn't surprise me if they forgot to patch in the changes to FM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panternoir</div><div class="date">07-10-03, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here... Spent 1.5 hours in FM with a tracker and no angry gob.  I did venture into Droga and found one of the new improved mobs spawned where the angry gob used to spawn.  He might spawn 3 days after server up orrrrrr they didnt include the changes to FM in this patch :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Wuven</div><div class="date">07-10-03, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you check the caves that are pretty close to the Nurga entrance and find those caves full of goblins instead of Burnyai then the changes have been put in place. That would be the easiest way to verify the changes are in. Tracking for the Angry Goblin could very well mean that he simply wasn't up while you are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_StevoWevo</div><div class="date">07-10-03, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the Brunyai or however it is spelled still inhabit both of their caves.<br />
<br />
I found no campable area of goblins that the posts i've read lately seemed to imply.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind supposedly traitor and chief were moved out here too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panternoir</div><div class="date">07-10-03, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, the Brunyai are still in their cave so the changes have not taken place yet. So.... The quest chain is broken at this point until the changes are implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kaninfrenzy TA</div><div class="date">07-10-03, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Burnyai caves still full of Burnyai and not goblins on Emarr also. I checked FM on Test and the saw the Goblin Traitor and Angry Goblin in their new spots so I know I'm checking the right location. Took a trip into Droga on Test and Emarr and found another Goblin Traitor in his old spot so maybe the Angry Goblin can still spawn in Droga also. There was a spider on his spawn point though. I wonder if it's a PH type spawn now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Wuven</div><div class="date">07-10-03, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had noticed that the Goblin Traitor was showing up in the new Droga as well as in the FM caves. Unsure if the Angry can spawn in both places as well. I have seen him in FM but haven't really searched the new droga for him. Droga isn't really the safest place to go searching around solo anymore. I did find a new quest guy in Droga and once I dropped invis, I took 2 1k HT's real fast.</div></div><hr />
