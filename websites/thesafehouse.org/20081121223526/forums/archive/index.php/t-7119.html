<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aledar1</div><div class="date">11-18-02, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently moved to a country area, and had to switch from a cable connection to a satellite connection. I used to play a monk, but now I can barely do anything!<br />
<br />
It takes 3 seconds to react to anything I do (looting my corpse takes forever), and when I am trying to pull, I can never FD properly. Every time I zone, I get booted to server screen. I try to hit monsters while they are walking, but I can never generate an attack. I can only fight scowling mobs.<br />
<br />
Ok enough of complaining, I basically have 2 questions:<br />
<br />
1) Is there any class that can do ok under lag? I was thinking beastlord, because they have pets that can attack to generate aggro, and to finish off the monster, and they can solo pretty well. Was also thinking SK, but I don't know<br />
<br />
2) Does anyone know of some other internet connection besides some crappy satellite thing that allows me to run things faster? Again, I can't use a cable connection because I live out in the middle of nowhere.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

The ping times on dialup are much better than satellite and EQ runs fine on a 56k. Would probably save you a good deal of cash each month too.<br />
<br />
That being said you could play a Shaman/Beastlord under high lag conditions without too much trouble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Satellite is really fast, and nice for general internet use and file downloads.  The inherent latency, though, makes it horrible for games.  The signal between systems literally has farther to travel: up into space, then back down again, THEN across normal landlines from Hughes or whoever the provider is to the host -- AND BACK AGAIN.  So even though it may be travelling at the speed of light, and the bandwidth isn't limited by the medium (as much), it takes longer to initiate communication.<br />
<br />
I hope that makes sense.<br />

You can solo as well as most other classes without requiring perfect timing. You can contribute to a group just fine without perfect timing. You won't be as effective as someone without the lag, but I think that magician is probably the least effected by a poor connection. Downsides would be that people never invite magicians to groups because they don't realize they outdamage rogues, your pet will poof when you go linkdead, and Verant hates magicians more than most classes. <br />

<br />
As far as class, avoid anything that casts, heals, or does crowd control.  Maybe warrior, though at high end you need to be able to switch targets quick.  You don't want to miss laying off the attack when mobs rampage.</div></div><hr />

It wouldnt be so bad in some areas but there are times when you need immediate control of that pet.   Playing a pure melee is much easier in lag than playing a caster, but neither is fun...<br />
<br />
I would try going for a phone connection myself... <br />
