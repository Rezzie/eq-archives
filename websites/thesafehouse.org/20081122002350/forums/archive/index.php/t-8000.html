<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furlined</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The backdrop is that I play fairly casually.  I'm still new to CoH and playing around a bit.  I have a level 8 Mutant Scrapper on Protector.  I like to just go slow and solo as I learn the ropes, so I'm getting really annoyed that I can't walk five steps without having to hit No I don't want to join a team.  This is 9 times out of 10 someone who has not spoken a word to me, but just invited me.  Does this annoy anyone else or is it just me?  Do they have some kind of LFG tool like EQ that could help with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It happens to me constantly, especially if I go into Perez Park or the Sewers. Yes, there's an LFG tool, and it's off by default. I weep for anyone who succumbs to joining groups led by people who randomly invite passers-by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-15-04, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not off by default, it turns itself on when hit level 5 or so (the one where the trainer says &quot;Go find a group!&quot;), and then it turns itself back on at random points after that.  Usually after you zone or complete a mission.  It will stay on even if you log off and back on.  Very annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-15-04, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're not a dink, you're not alone. Happens to me all the time, and out of principle I never join a group like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Kaylan</div><div class="date">05-15-04, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I was just coming here to complain about that very thing.  I swear I click on the &quot;no&quot; button more than I click on my powers buttons ... that damn invite box is constantly up.  What's really bad is when it's the same damn person sending the invites over and over again.<br />
<br />
And I too would never join a group if they can't bother to send me a /tell first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biral</div><div class="date">05-15-04, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In another game i play, people do this with guild invites as well.....occasionally when i'm on an alt with no guild i'll join, do something like /o (/gu) Leader_XXX, i'm not really a girl irl, so please stop asking me for cyber ok? :(, or something equally embarassing to the leader, and leave right away. Where am i going with this? if a guy repeatedly invites you, join up for a minute and say &quot;sorry just soloing&quot; and leave. He will probably stop inviting you after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats odd, my lft thing never goes on by itself that I'm aware of.  However, I have noticed that when I do turn it on, I always get a group in the first 2 minutes.  THAT'S a welcome change from EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's some bugs with it.  As leader, I've checked who is looking sometimes.  Oddly enough, a guy on my team is listed as LFT.  And I have had mine toggle on before as well.  If you get an invite you don't want, check to see that you aren't somehow on the list looking for group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never got a random invite without finding out that I've had LFT on, and I'm absolutely positive it flips on automatically.  Just this morning I was in Talos, had the little tab up and it said &quot;Seek Group.&quot;  Took the tram to Steel Canyon, and when I got there it was on &quot;Stop Seek.&quot;</div></div><hr />
