<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">04-01-06, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, the ranger has a name thank you. Heres the rundown: Rag either forgot or had something to do, Jaes forgot but remembered to join, however about the time he joined everett had to take off, tea is really freaking sick, I managed to pull mineself away from oblivion but didn't mind going back to it. So yea, not a complete success but not a failure either. Like jaes said lets all find a night this week we can do it, and do it! <br />
<br />
I am free every night this week and weekend, unless something comes up last second, like a zombie invasion or something.</div></div><hr />

I think we need to repeat him a few times and get a good solid strategy down (Though the Benny Hill strategy worked out... a 1 hour fight is kinda ridiculous).

<br />
But yeah, in the end the Benny Hill strat proved the most effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">04-07-06, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to say again, great group last night, even if that Golem was a PITA...

<br />
I've actually documented what happened in the boss fight last night. Not completely accurate but if you want to know what last night felt like. This is pretty much it. <br />
<br />
The &quot;Golem&quot; ONLY wanted to hurt the mage, so we had a great time trying to keep him away. Mix that in with the golem full healing all the time, and no one but the mage being able to do any damage, and you get hilarity.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Actually I take that back, no one but troz or the mage could hurt him, and troz could do so only very slowly.<br />
<br />
Shan To Kor.wmv (http://home.comcast.net/~debradebbiedeb/FunBossFight.wmv)<br />
<br />
Like I said, not what happened, but I'm not animating 2 hours of a boss fight. It was the gist of what happened though, I think we did a great job of coming up with new strategies to counter a stupid A.I.<br />
<br />
2nd EDIT: I was really really really really really bored. Didn't take that long, photoshop is your friend.....<br />
<br />
3rd EDIT: If you want to replicate last night, just keep the video on repeat for an hour or so. Only pretend it's much less annoying and much more funnier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">04-08-06, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously though, that's ******* hilarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">04-08-06, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL<br />
<br />
Oh man, that's is sooo accurate.  I was laughing my ass off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">04-08-06, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, for some odd reason my + to my rolls was changing from +8 to +9 to +10 throughout the fight, no rhyme or reason. (All while using the 2 hander)<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a plot!  :tinfoil</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">04-08-06, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Attacking while running gives you a -4 penalty to swings, I imagine the extra bonuses were likely due to the golem having aggro on someone else (that's a +1 or +2... can't remember which). As for the last variable, **** if I know.<br />
<br />
I did notice my own attack bonus changing throughout the fight as well, it is really.... quite odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">04-08-06, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I burned at least 200 wand charges on damage and healing in that mess, and it turned out all I needed to do was buff the warforged with the two-hander.  Don't I feel silly...<br />
<br />
We're on for tonight, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">04-08-06, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think t's gona be there, unless we play beyond 11 oclock est. If so he might be able to join us, not sure, not him. I know however that I will be there, eight on the toggle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">04-08-06, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm down for it.

Point blank stats: +19 to hit, 1d10+2d6+8, crits go to 3d10+2d6+24,<br />

Manyshot still applies, it's a very very viable build, I don't take hits well, but... holy crap, the damage is insane. I don't have a pure mele character so I can't compare it, but, things just drop fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will remember that the last time we went through shan to kor, fully locked and loaded with a mage, a rogue, a ranger, a cleric, a bard, and a fighter, we had our arses handed to us for more than an hour (at the boss alone) not to mention the time we spent on traps and such.<br />
<br />
I give you .. well, hehe. You'll see.<br />

I spent most of the time chain healing, and even when I wasn't I failed a lot of the UMD rolls.  I'm going to bank those 3rd level MM wands and go back to the 1st level ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and trying to get a friend to activate his account (been realy busy with real life stuff so he hasn't had the time)<br />
<br />
So what class should I force him into being?  :lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">04-26-06, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We could use a rogue most, someone for doors and traps.  Really though, anything is fine.<br />
<br />
I'll see about Friday.  If we're going to make a regular second day though, I'd prefer something mid-week, Tuesday or Wednesday maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">04-26-06, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">O' course I ordered it, I had the funnest time doing so though. I was trying to figure out why there were two of the same card.. only one was two dollars more, so I sat there glancing back and forth between the two cards for thirty minutes until I realized one was retail and the other was OEM. <br />
<br />
Byut yea, we could really use a rogue, not only do they attack and stuff, but they raise the maximum loot we can get, which is always a good thing hehe (stupid locked doors). Try to get him to make a character on Lhazaar and get it to two or three if he has the time. I think if we could make it tuesday that would be great, tea would be able to join us as well I think. I wouldn't be able to be on as late but I could make it to one or two possibly.<br />

<br />
Yeah I'll try to get him to go rogue.  I'll give me my modified Tea template which allows for mad dex and 14 int/wis so all it takes is a potion and he can open damn near any door, other than str, which I can do.<br />
<br />
<br />

Turns out high levels[ok I was wrong, very few people know how to actually beat the vampire, so I got something rare for cheap :)]get them all the time.. so now that I have it that just leaves one very large problem....<br />
<br />
I failed to notice it has a minimum level of 6.. I know I know, *cough* <br />
<br />
It is sooo worth it though, like you can see above, once usable the damage is macrastronomical(new word!). So yea, can't wait until group night! <br />

Don't hurt me!:ontome It was pretty and shiny and I had to have it!<br />

<br />
So I should log on soon*<br />

So yea, I will only have time to finish that quest and do a few quick ones, but I will have time. I vill be there if you guys are. <br />
<br />
We shall show the people that courage and will can overcome any adversity even if that adversity is spinning bladetraps surrounded by giant horizontal guillotines and floor spikes!<br />

Not sure when my friend in Texas will actually be able to play.  Don't worry about healing me, between a bard and a cleric loaded with wands and spells I'm good, you can just blow **** up.

That would make four, .. and with a caster.. I can't imagine what damage we could do. With four when we hit the right level we can fight some vampires and dragons. Or maybe vampiric dragons.... burn it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">04-30-06, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What level so I know where I should be by tuesday?</div></div><hr />

Gona be great having ya back, we've been making due, doing pretty well actually.. but with you there the enemy won't have a chance to hurt us, and if they due eve is awesome about the life saving thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">04-30-06, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, been thinking.. I like to type what I think so you can tell me whether I'm right or wrong.. <br />
<br />
With my +1 Full Plate I get a 9 ac bonus bringing me to a 20 ac +2 base. <br />
I would normaly get a +5 dex ac bonus but the full plate negates that.. not oily enough I suppose. <br />
Once we finish stranglethorn and get those +3 skill items (mine being dexterity)<br />
I would have 21 dex +3 bringing me to 24 (I'm a math wiz) that would be a +7 normaly and a +9 with cats grace cast on me. <br />
Right now, naked I am getting a 17+2 ac. If I were to be at +7 all the time I would be getting a 19+2 normaly and a 21+2 with CG. Now to help jaesin get into market we could do waterworks again.. and I could get those +4ac bracers.. that puts me at 19+2+4ac normaly and 21+2+4 with CG. <br />
<br />
Anyhow .. where I am getting with this is I want yous' guys' opinions. Should I go with a robe of spell resist(13) or a robe of spearblock? Or some other robe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-01-06, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, multiple + items don't stack, along with cats grace and +3 dex bracers, your net enchantment bonus won't go above +4 with cat's grace, bulls, etc. etc.<br />

Jae said he can't join us until later later like 11 o'clock due to work, so if the three o us (don't know about tea) get on we can finish up tangle and maybe try some other stuff.</div></div><hr />
