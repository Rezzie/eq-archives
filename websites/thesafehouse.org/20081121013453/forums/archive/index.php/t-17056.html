<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">01-30-05, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main question is Why not allow Taunt to work in PVP, especially Battlegrounds.  Rogues can use distract, which is another form of Taunt, and I feel like it would make the game much more interesting if Warriors, and who ever else has Taunt to try to make people focus on them instead of wailing on the priest.  In WC3 the Mountain Giants of the Elves had a taunt ability, so it's not so far out of line.  Sure it would be annoying to be taunted off your target as your about to finish it, but I guess they could make it so taunt was resisted every know and then.  On the other hand, it would probably just end up forcing a player to continuously click on the the character that they are attacking to counteract the taunt.  I just felt it could make for more strategy in PVP and make it a more interesting time.  What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

When I PVP I like it on my terms, face to face. Which is why I carry the net gun ;).<br />

If they had to constantly be aware of their target, that'd make PVP a lot more interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess you wont like running to a hunter when you always get the pet as target roght ?<br />
<br />
Hunters themselves have also a taunt shot which would be annoying if you running after the priest... <br />
<br />
That would make Hunters way to uber in Mass group PvP.</div></div><hr />

Sure it would be annoying for me, as I'm not a taunting class and it could be used with great effectiveness against me, but I never like it when class abilities are removed or dumbed down for pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harvey</div><div class="date">01-31-05, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it makes sense as well (even though I would find it equally annoying).  Without it, any class with taunt is immediately gimped when going from PvE to PvP.  It's almost like saying the stun on gouge or kick suddenly &quot;don't work&quot; because a rogue is in PvP.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the coding would be trickier than say a fear or a stun, but I think if it worked more like a charm spell, that forced the &quot;taunted&quot; PC to attack the &quot;taunting&quot; PC for the duration, it would create battles that are far more realistic, with frontline troops battling each other while any types of flanking manuevers would have to go wide around the battle rather than just running right through the ranks.<br />
<br />
Heck, taunting PCs could coordinate taunts just to keep the battle in some form of order.  Even the distract-like effect would be ok, but I think it'd be more interesting to see it work like taunt against NPCs.  I would at least be curious to see the playtesting for this type of environment.   :D</div></div><hr />

So that was the way taunt worked there....so if you wanna taunt sumone...better land some big hits and maybe they will focus on you.<br />
<br />
Taunting is nothing but..well taunting. So in a way you can still taunt a target off another target in PvP...but a mob doesnt react to /rude so they made a skill for certain classes to be better a &quot;**** talking&quot;...which wouldnt work in game pvp anyways cause you couldnt understand them =p...i still think we should be able to learn a few key phrases from the other side.<br />
<br />
Think about in real life wars, odds are everyone knows a few foul words to yell at the other side when fighting...</div></div><hr />
