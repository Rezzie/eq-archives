<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pherret</div><div class="date">08-30-01, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, a frame is where two or more &quot;windows&quot; are displayed on a page at once.  Both pages have a seperate URL and can be controlled seperately.  A good example of this is the Safehouse homepage.  There a top window that has the navigation and a bottom window with all the content.  Another example is Yahoo Email (if you have one).<br />
<br />
An I-frame is a traditional framed window that &quot;floats&quot; in the at a position in another page.  It is code that is specific to IE and will not work with any other browser.  This is why they are getting rid of it because it is imcompatable with all other browsers... business wise, it's a good decision.  Technically, it's not a good decision because It's extremely useful but the remaining 5% of the population that still uses Netscape or another browser is a significant reason to not use it.  <br />
<br />
Netscape is the devil.  I will be sooooo happy the day when there is only one browser... but I doub't this will ever happen =(  .  For web programmers, it's a nightmare getting your code compatable on 12 platform/browser/version configurations.

The biggest problem with browsers now is that the comerical browsers do not follow the standards that were designed for the technologies.  That makes the problems, not having the multiple browsers.  Personally, I can't stand IE.  The large number of bugs almost forces me to go elsewhere; add to that fact that it does not follow many of the standards, I will gladly take Mozilla (and do) anyday.  However, as webmaster, I am forced to design within a subset of the standards that IE supports.  Mozilla is still the for-runner as far as stability and technological advancement of any major browser.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ugli Itchybottom</div><div class="date">08-31-01, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back when the browsers were in 3.0 versions, netscape was much better than IE.<br />
<br />
Netscape hasn't added much since then (except for version 6, where the interface had such a complete overhaul people don't recognize it and its almost unused), while IE has added a ton, and become faster and more stable.<br />
<br />
While I agree with the point about following the standards ...something Microsoft does NOT do... they still don't support server push animations that were part of the HTML 1.0 spec for example, while they add a TON of their own proprietary stuff that becomes the defacto (not official)standard since they now have over 95% market share.<br />
<br />
A few of the things Microsoft has implemented maybe should actually become part of the official standards.  For example getting DHTML code to work with IE is 10x easier than getting it to work in Netscape.<br />
<br />
Another thing I dislike about Netscape is it totally hogs your CPU while waiting for a page to download.  With IE the CPU is idle when the browser is awaiting more data to come through.  This is especially bad if the webserver and the browser are on the same machine.  The netscape process generally takes much higher priority than the webserver process, so the webserver delivers pages slower to netscape because the server gets no CPU time while netscape is waiting on it.  Really nasty cycle going there. Shamoo<br />

<br />
If that ever happened, I would have to quit my job for good.  I wouldn't be able to stand that.  It takes about a day of QA for something to go out the door with 2 browsers to check, imagine what would happen if there was even 5 browsers!  Compliancy is a pain epecially with DHTML and flash.  Of all the browsers to code for, Netscape is by FAR the worst.  We don't even check Mozilla because it represents less than 1% of our customer base.<br />
<br />
Quote: The biggest problem with browsers now is that the comerical browsers do not follow the standards that were designed for the technologies. <br />
<br />
I completely agree.  If all the browers followed the standards, I wouldn't have any problems but, when it comes down to it, it's a business and the business will always add things to make it's browser more attractive than the other.  Compliancy is something I don't see in the near future.</div></div><hr />

I really don't care which one, just stick to it!  Authoring for Opera (baseline) and Netscape and IE in all their various versions is a pain in the ass.  Monopoly?  I am ok with that by now.

I'm not a prof. web designer or anything but have done some casual designing like my guild's website. One thing I like to use a lot is empty table cells serving as a visual border something like this:<br />
<br />
banner<br />
======<br />
i = main<br />
i = main<br />
i = main<br />
i = main<br />
======<br />
footer<br />
<br />
with i's being the left navigation bar, ='s being an empty table cell with a background color, and main being the main area with the info heh. It's nice because it scales to whatever size a particular subpage is, and looks pretty clean. Except stupid netscape doesn't register the background color when there's no data in a cell, so it just looks like an empty area. Still have never found a way around this.</div></div><hr />
