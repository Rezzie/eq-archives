<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Berdusk</div><div class="date">09-19-02, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah... casters are powerful (overpowered?) once again... Last night, it came down to this. <br />
<br />
A first level party of an erudite necro, ogre warrior, ogre shadowknight, and dark elf rogue took on a party of five first-level barbarian warriors(presumably warriors). The ogre warrior got knocked on his ass with the first hit he got. The necro managed to disease cloud all of the barbarians. The shadowknight killed two of the barbarians personally, and I held off a barbarian from killing the necro (thanks to my high dex, otherwise I'd be dead).<br />
<br />
What the necro and I were considering before the shadowknight started kicking ass, was that once he DOT'd all the barbarians, we could have just run off and come back to the caravan in 30 minutes. Those barbarians would all be dead.<br />
<br />
Me personally, I don't like how rogues get jack at first level. Yeah, it's EQ. But take a look at every other d20 out there, a rogue would get a sneak attack or something at first level. Most classes get something at first. Anyway, I feel like I'm starting to whine, so enough of that.<br />
<br />
But, I dunno. That was only one session of making characters and starting the game. Anyone else played the d20 EQ recently or have any comments?</div></div><hr />

And as I understand it, spells aren't supposed to be easy to get; a wizard or a necro might have to quest for their best spell or something at higher levels and may not have it for a very long time. As all tabletops go, the DM has total power to change whatever the hell they want.   Quote of the Day:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Daniva Vkt</div><div class="date">09-19-02, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like that the rogues have gimped atk bonus less than most other melee classes.  Don't like that one bit.  I know in D&amp;amp;D rogues don't fight as well as warriors, but it seems the opposite of EQ in fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TibisHatter</div><div class="date">09-20-02, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you take a look at all of the classes in the EQ RPG, the rogues come out as least representative of the EverQuest parent class, and it's obvious that SSS has drawn more heavily on D&amp;D 3E than EQ as the source - but then, EQ RPG rogues can take on more of the sneaky role and less of the battle role.<br />
<br />
Part of the reason for the reduction in BAB might have been to keep backstab (sneak attack) damage under something resembling control - but I would have done Backstab as a separate attack rather than using the D&amp;D sneak attack rules.<br />
<br />
It does look to me that most of the work for the EQ RPG went into shoehorning the EQ mana based magic system into D20 - and I must admit it does look good.  I don't think that anywhere near as much effort went into designing the fighting classes.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, and they need to fire whoever printed the cover.  It's an abysmal treatment of the Keith Parkinson picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">09-20-02, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess the thing is that in a PnP game the fact that rogues have other skills actually means something. As such, they have to be weaker in battle than in EQ, where non combat skills are largely irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">09-25-02, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks alot like the EQ pnp game is alot more balanced and well thought out than the computer game ever was.</div></div><hr />

The best part about it though - is that bards never have to worry about stacking issues.<br />
