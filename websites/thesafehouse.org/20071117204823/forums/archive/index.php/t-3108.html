<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-19-03, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, working on my new pirate setting, and one thing I despise if names of places that are in a foreign language, but are either fake, sound wrong, use the wrong spelling, or are otherwise bogus.  So I figure that the safehouse has got more language power in it than most places, so I'm asking for help.  Here's what I need.  I need names for nautical or exile sounding places.  In my setting, people from all over have been cast adrift in a strange and mystical remnant of another world.  So I want to convet that sense of loss, and their mariner origins.  I've come up with a couple, but I'm not sure if I have the wording right.<br />
<br />
1. German- Graufelsen, Grey Cliff?<br />
2. Dutch- Viermurr, Four Walls?<br />
3. French Dernier Espoir, Last Hope<br />
4. Spanish Salvamento, Salvage<br />
5. Italian-Need<br />
6. Welsh-Need<br />
7. Arabic-Need<br />
8. Portuguese-Need<br />
9. Polynesian-Need<br />
10. Yoruban-The West African area santeria comes from.<br />
11. Phoenician<br />
12. Viking<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.   Edited by: MARBH at: 8/20/03 9:27 am</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-20-03, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Swipey, I will look into that.  I actually have a more established continental power that is a amalgam of Roman and Chinese elements.  Figured why not make the Imperials twice as strong.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea what Aku Aku means, but if you gave them a call I'm sure they'd tell you.<br />

That's all I got.  I'm a language flunkie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-20-03, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, thanks.  I think I might go for a Samoan/Maori cross.  To be honest I believe if the Samoans had been on a continent and not a island, we would all be wearing sarongs.  Very physically tough people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">08-20-03, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the Samoans had been living on a continent instead of an island, they would have been under different social and physical pressures, and would likely have turned out different themselves.<br />
<br />
But yeah, Samoans as we know them are pretty tough.</div></div><hr />

I figured i would have them landed at a very rocky granite heavy inlet and expanded out from there.  Most likely gonna go with a Hanseatic League/Holy Roman Empire type thing, or maybe Saxon/Franks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">08-22-03, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I'm not sure what it will do to the translation (I think it's the same word, but it may be salvamiento), but I wouldn't name the Spanish town &quot;salvage.&quot;<br />
<br />
That has certain...connotations...that may be undesirable to a seafarer    I'd call it &quot;Salvation&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-22-03, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the reason I'm calling it that, is that they are positioned where the current push all the refuse and drifting hulks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried to think of some names, but I need more time for that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fablar</div><div class="date">09-09-03, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm .. a Welsh coastal town that is supposed to relate to desolation and loss? Well .. Port Talbot springs to mind  <br />
<br />
Actually a lot of Welsh coastal towns are at river mouths, so just name a river something gutteral and add 'Aber' (pro. ab-er) to the start which means 'mouth of ..'.<br />
Of, if it's a fortified town, just name it something gutteral and add 'Caer' (pro. care) to the start which means 'fort ..' (I think, or is it town?). E.g Caerdydd (pro. care-Deeth) (capital of Wales, called Cardiff in English)<br />
<br />
Wait a minute - desolute place where no-one wants to go, and yet only the truly lost can find it? Pobol-y-Cym! (apologies to any taffs out there  )</div></div><hr />
