<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krow</div><div class="date">04-25-07, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm new to the community but I'd like to bring some attention to a few hidden pvp nerfs with the rogue class. Before the patch last week Ravage when used in conjunction with critical attack would stun your pvp target for 3 seconds. This allowed us to get at least 1 more attack in before the target would move/run/heal and proceed to kick your tail. After the patch the stun component for pvp has been removed. Now you only get 1 hit in before your target starts to own you. This is very important in the day's of shaman pet's 1 shotting people, or monks beating your brains out in toe to toe combat. I know we have ton's of things that need to be fixed, but i thought this was important because its something that was actually taken away from us. Guys we need to band together on this or the hidden nerf's will continue. I personally /bug'ed this and everyone who play's a rogue should test it and bug if they see fit. If you do not belive its a problem then its on you.</div></div><hr />
