Macros, key mapping etc.<br />
<br />
I find myself switching often between using both hands on the keyboard and one on the keyboard and mouse.  And this just isn't efficient.<br />

Thanks   <br />

<br />
Movement keys set to a,w,s,d.  Attack is q.  My hotbuttons, therefore, are right there in easy reach.  I change them every once in a while, but basically my joust, throw, and backstab buttons are 1, 2, and 3.  My joust button has both attack, backstab, and disarm on it and this is what I usually use when attacking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nocha</div><div class="date">06-08-01, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can anyone comment on how to change your mvmt buttons to these or other letters on the keyboard?<br />
<br />
I configured my 3rd mouse button  to correlate w/ enter. However i have yet to figure out how to make the enter key trigger my backstab button (its hotkey #2)<br />
<br />
I guess if i moved my mvmt buttons to something like aswd i would not have to worry about the 3rd mouse button.<br />
<br />
also, when , making macros are you limited to a certain number abilities you can activate  via &quot;doability&quot;? with more than 6 abilities, i could not doability7 eg: it limited me to 6.<br />
 I made a evade/bs macro, travel macro, but when i wanted to add sense traps to the travel it would not work<br />
<br />
Yeah, plenty will read this and call me dumb, but dangit i just could not figure this out. <br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
