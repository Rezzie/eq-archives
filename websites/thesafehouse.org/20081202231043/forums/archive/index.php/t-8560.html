<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arctura Silvermist</div><div class="date">05-29-03, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Talk to Noxhil in Neriak 3rd gate (top ot necromancers guild). Ask him 'who is Innoruuk'. He will mention the 'scroll of G'han.' <br />
<br />
Apparently G'han was one of the greatest and earliest necromancers ever. (probably the next one after miragul)<br />
He had a scroll which apparently was used by the leaders in Neriak to communicate directly with Innoruuk. (methinks this is their way of saying the scroll of G'han contains the words of innoruuk himself, similar to the christian bible or the Coran (sp?) having the words of their respective gods written therein)<br />
<br />
The Scroll of g'han was torn into two pieces, one lies somewhere in Neriak. Noxhil says 'we have the first piece', ye he says the indigo brotherhood are seeking the second one. (does that mean they have the first one, or he does? or The Dead does??)<br />
Also, the second piece was apparently stolen by a thief bound for Felwithe. In felwithe the second half of the scroll lies (so he says). <br />
<br />
It is said that when the scroll of G'han is pieced together, innoruuks power will engulf norrath with all his hate and rage n stuff.<br />
<br />
Neet! <br />
<br />
(an old quest, if it is actually a quest, not just ambient Lore.)<br />
<br />
Anyone have any leads, or details?<br />

It was finally confirmed by GMs after years of head scratching that this is nothing but backstory.  There is no scroll.  There is no spoon.<br />
<br />
Not that GMs are always correct on everything, but I'm damned sure it's just another one of the many abandoned, dead-end quest ideas.</div></div><hr />
