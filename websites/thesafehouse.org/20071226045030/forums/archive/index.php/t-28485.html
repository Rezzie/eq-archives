<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glip the Gnome</div><div class="date">02-20-07, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just watched it over the weekend, anyone else had a chance to see it yet?<br />
<br />
The opening scene with the theme music playing and all that got me pretty excited but after that it was sort of downhill :P<br />
<br />
It wasn't bad, but it seemed really short and jumped around a lot. I thought it would be more about Scott Bernard and the earth resistance fight against the Invid but the Invid weren't really the main &quot;bad guy&quot;. The new bad guys, the Haydonites, weren't really the main &quot;bad guy&quot; so to speak either for most of the movie. Maybe thats why I kind of felt something was missing. <br />
<br />
I went in to it thinking it would be more about the aftermath of what happened at Reflex Point, and maybe one big final blowout with the Invid with Rick Hunter showing up but instead they kind of switched us to the Haydonites who really aren't anywhere as cool as the Invid. I heard this was supposed to be the lead in to a new series?<br />
<br />
I hope the Invid aren't gone completely, they were way too cool to give up for some cyborgy guys in capes. <br />
<br />
Oh well, wasn't super great but it didnt stink either. Worth the hour and a half if you've got nothing better to do. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: And as an aside, it was cool that Scott Bernard (and of course Marlene/Ariel) was in it but I really missed the rest of the New Generation characters (well, except for Annie :P)</div></div><hr />
