Which is why you wont see autotrain on all classes, and abilities. CS is not CRITICAL for a SB to survive, but to use a CS ability you MUST have stealth at some level. Shadowzerkes are like this, Min Stealth, max LA max Axe, and max Poison, then when they get attacked they do a /face or /stick, and let fly with their return PA in an attempt to outcrit the attacker.<br />
