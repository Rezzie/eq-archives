I was wondering if getting equipment was going to be a big problem.  I don't have a large guild to help with raids and a lot of equipment I would try for on a blue server seems to be out of reach do to enemy controlled zones.  Anyone here have any suggestions on how best to get the needed equipment without joining a larger guild?</div></div><hr />
