And despite what most people think, a lot of people enjoy dubs, even if the hardcore fans find the voices terrible.<br />
<br />
Sounds like an interesting way to get people to watch anime. I forgot to mention, but it's in the source article- it gets launched June 17.</div></div><hr />

Add a flaming tennis ball here and there, gravity defying manuvers everywhere, take away a little bit of logic, add a little bit of shounen cliches, viola!<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I thought it was fun. Stopped before the end because I wanted the whole thing to be animated, but guess that didn't happen. The OVA's might be a good enough consolidance,but don't have the time for now.<br />
<br />
And Prince of Tennis has been rumored to be licensed for a while, this confirmed it though. So it's not coming for a little longer.</div></div><hr />
