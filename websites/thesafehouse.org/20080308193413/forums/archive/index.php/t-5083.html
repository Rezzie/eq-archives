Backstab 2 does hella dmg + stuns and has 2 followup moves.  PA i think has 1 followup. whats the difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ciardha Sidhe</div><div class="date">05-25-02, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PA does significantly more damage than BS2.<br />
<br />
BS2 only has one follow-up move, Thigh Cut.  PA has two follow-up moves, Creeping Death and Stunning Stab.  Both Creeping Death and Stunning Stab do significantly more damage than Thigh Cut.<br />
<br />
BS2 stun is very short.  PA has no stun, but Creeping Death has a much better stun, around 6 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
BS2 and Thigh Cut both have defense penalties.  PA has a defense penalty, but Stunning Stab has a defense bonus.<br />
<br />
PA is stealthed from the front.  BS2 is stealthed from the back.  Sometimes it's more convenient to use one or the other rather than try to get on the other side of someone/something. Ciardha Sidhe, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br />

Anyways, I had like a lvl 12 Infiltrator or something... and I know that it was damn easy to get a BS from behind.<br />
<br />
How are you suposed to successfully get PA off?  Don't you get seen everytime you go right in front of someone?  I had 100% stealth at the time and I was still seen.  Has this changed, or was I doing something wrong?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xumten</div><div class="date">06-06-02, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO PA is much easier to setup in RvR than a BS2. When I played my Shade, I was so used to using PA in RvR. Then I made a SB and went to the BG before I had gotten PA. I was lost... I never realized how nice PA is. <br />
<br />
Really dont need any tips to lining it up IMO. And people line up different ways. You'll figure it out.</div></div><hr />

That makes it all the more fun to play. It was hard for me to learn at first.<br />
<br />
Stealth can be exposed if you hang around right in front of the target for too long so you need to get in and do your business.<br />
<br />
I think that perf is also the only non evade style that causes bleeding (besides the weak punture chain) and bleed is rumored to prevent casters from casting so a perf on a caster is prolly as good as dead if bleed interupts them. Dont think you would use evade moves on a caster.<br />
<br />
Check my page for details on how I use perf and other tactix.<br />
