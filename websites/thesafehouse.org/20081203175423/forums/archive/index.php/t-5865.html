<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dark Hour Rogue</div><div class="date">08-20-01, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello my fellow rogues!  My name is Jest Acestalker and I am the assistant guildmaster to the greatest safe haven for rogues in all of Norrath, the guild Dark Hour.  Dark Hour once again is proving to live up to this great distinction by holding a rogue career day near the Kelethin Rogue guild inside Gfay.  This great rogue event is scheduled to start at 10:00 CST Thursday night, but never expect a bunch of rogues to get started on time!!!!  This event will be for young and old rogues alike.  For the new rogue who has questions that he would like to see answered to the older, more experienced rogue who would like to share information and perhaps could learn a new trick, this event has something for every rogue out there.  Or perhaps, as a rogue you are interested in a guild with a tradition such as ours.  We can answer all of those questions as well.  You can chat with one or all of our great Dark Hour rogues.  Since Dark Hour is not a rogue only guild, this event is open to all classes, however, it is primarily a rogue event.  We welcome all and will greet all with open arms and you might as well show up to see whats going on because DRINKS ON US!!!!!<br />
