Now, for all that know this city and the zone, they know that it is the city of the midgets, the munchkins, the small lads, the wee men, the.... well you get the point.  Anyway, everything about this city is perfectly fine EXCEPT one thing, the GIANT midget.  A Giant Midget, that is right.  A Giant Midget with a Giant Axe to be exact.  And this GIANT midget looks down on you.  A GIANT midget looking DOWN on YOU!  I haven't been able to sleep for many a night since that horrid scene.  A GIANT MIDGET!!!!!  IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM TO BE THE SMALLEST, THEY HAVE TO GO AHEAD AND BE THE LARGEST-SMALLEST!!!!! BBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  VERY DISTURBING INDEAD.. MUAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHA<br />

Sorry I don't have enough time on my hands to sit and think these things up.  It was a joke, hehe.  We were laughing about this for the whole boat ride to Freeport.  Just wanted to see if anyone had a little humor in them.<br />
