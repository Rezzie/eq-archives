<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sintenal</div><div class="date">07-07-02, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">say my stealth in lvl 20-24 bg is 24 + 5 with items.  would this extra stealth give me any advantage over a rouge of lvl 24 or anyone in general.  i heard from someone that in 20-24 bg the smallest your bubble of stealth can be is with 24 stealth and that the +5 stealth is wasted.  .. is this true ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_SneakyandMean</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what most people seem to agree on, there is a minimum radius of detection of 125 loc units for any rogue (see exception below).  This is about the length of a horse.  When someone is trying to find a stealther, the stealth lvl of the stealther is compared to the character level of the guy looking for the stealther.  At stealth lvl equal to or greater then the char lvl the minimum radius (125) is applied.  For every point of stealth of the stealther below the char lvl of the seeker, 20 loc units is added to the min detect radius.  Ex: stealth spec 22, char lvl 24, radius 185.  <br />
<br />
So, the short answer to your question is that in the bg, where the highest char lvl is 24, stealth above 24 does not help your stealth at all.  However, since movement speed while stealthed is related to stealth spec, you may move a bit quicker w/ 29 stealth as opposed to 24 stealth.  I had 23 w/ items for most of my &quot;career&quot; in Thidranki and did just fine.  <br />
<br />
Note: for assassins with the detect hidden ability (trained stealth 16+) who are trying to find a stealthed rogue w/o detect hidden (archer &amp;amp; minstrel types) the minimum radius applicable to them is 250 loc units.  And for each char lvl of the assassin above the stealth lvl of the non-assassin rogue, 50 loc units is added to the detect range.<br />
<br />
This only applies to assassins w/ detect hidden.  Anyone else looking for a non-assassin rogue has the same 125 + 20 per lvl forumula.</div></div><hr />
