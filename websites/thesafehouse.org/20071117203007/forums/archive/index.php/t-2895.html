<br />
If you had been playing P&amp;amp;P games, you would have had less time to develop those awesome sigs of yours.  <br />
<br />
It's a trade off, I think you won  :P<br />
<br />
As an aside, I haven't actually played a tabletop game in probably 5 years, but I still spend time developing NPC's, items and plots on the off chance I manage to find another group that is not full of freaks.</div></div><hr />

I'm just not desperate enough to go to the game store and sign up with one of the guys there. Call me crazy but these little warning signs go off in my head when the group has to argue about who  has to take Drizzt's weapons or Elminister's spellbooks from last session because their Demi-plane stronghold just can't take more stuff. Freaks - ok. Munchkin freaks - I'm backing away slowly, screw that, I'm running like hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of the people I play with, none of us can be considered freaks.  None us fall into the negative sterotypes associated with gaming.  We're all social, out-going people, which may be why we've played some of the best goddamned campaigns in the history of man. <br />

Mostly Hardcore and Punk Bands.  A lot of famous people have gamed in their day(and still do).  The members of Kiss is a good example.  The band GWAR(pretty famous, but local to richmond) are notorious roleplayers, but they still get the hardcore fans.  Because someone is a gamer you shouldnt assume they have poor hygiene or are socially inept, hell I'm one of the most social people.  I also have a 2nd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and some 3 black 'sashes' in crane, mantis, and tiger kungfu.  Needless to say, I'm in good shape, One of the other guys I game with is employed by a modeling agency.  Gaming is a fun pastime, more people would do it if it weren't for the negative stereotypes associated with it.</div></div><hr />

I am not a socially inept individual, nor do I not bathe or wear all black or any the other typical stereo-types. Statements like that remind me of the pinheads in highschool who thought that the computer geeks were just that, geeks.<br />

You really can't judge gamers by what you see in a gamestore or convention anyways.<br />

<br />
I've been playing RPGs for over 20 years.  Lots of, if not most, gamers are intellegent.  People at the extreme ends of the intellegence spectrum are often more unconventional in their patterns of thought and action, ie weird. The majority of gamers have good hygene and social skills.  However...in my experience there is a significant percentage of gamers who fall toward the other end of the intellegence spectrum, and/or lack those social and hygene habits.  I was simply wishing on you the finding of the high end gamers to be in your group, instead to those on the other extreme.</div></div><hr />
