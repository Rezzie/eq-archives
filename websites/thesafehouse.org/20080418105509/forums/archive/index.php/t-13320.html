<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Alkeistarte</div><div class="date">08-30-04, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's another beautiful Monday. We're making it more beautiful by suspending over a hundred and fifty people busted for third party programs, and permanently terminating just under two dozen repeat offenders. The bright side to all this is that the number of people cheating has dropped dramatically.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I don't follow. If only 23 ppl were repeat offenders- that would mean the other 150 people were either first time users or you didn't catch them the first time? If you didn't catch them the first time I guess I don't see how your &quot;detection system&quot; works.  If they are fist time users then it doesn't seem like the number is dropping. <br />
<br />
I guess it's good news because it seems like good news and it's always good news when someone says it's good news. Well then great! That is good good news.  :crazy I mean it's not like anyone around can verify what they say anyway....and we all know how often they give us a complete picture *cough*  :liar  *cough*<br />
<br />
Perhaps now that they are all but gone, they can focus on the TL reports? :frown</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ripre</div><div class="date">08-30-04, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you read the forums for the radar programs, you will see that people are indeed being banned (Google on XUnleashed and DAOCSkilla).  I think the first two phases contained the largest swoops, and now it's just icing off the top that they're getting.  <br />
<br />
I view it like they targetted the most popular programs, nailed the users, and are now figuring out the smaller programs, as well as watching the popular programs' adjustments and nailing those who try the adjustments.<br />
<br />
The good news is: less people are radaring though! :)  I hope that Mythic keeps it up - it was pretty bad before I stopped playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Alkeistarte</div><div class="date">08-30-04, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do hope they are successful- but I DO think they are relying on ppl to turn in ppl and not on some sophisticated method. Otherwise they wouldn't need &quot;round 1, round 2 blah blah&quot;.  A database should be able to easily draw out offenders if something like that existed. <br />
<br />
However, according to those I know that use it- nothing is being done to them. (not that I want it to be). I'd rather they fix the ability for it to be used rather than ban the players- but that is just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ripre</div><div class="date">08-31-04, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but I DO think they are relying on ppl to turn in ppl and not on some sophisticated method.<br />
<br />
Actually the way that they do it is indeed &quot;sophisticated&quot;.  But it's just like running an anti-virus software company; you've gotta keep up with The Enemy.  Now let me preface this with an explanation of what I do: I am a quality engineer who works for a fortune 500 debugging software company.  I live for figuring out how things work and then breaking them :)<br />
<br />
I'm not going to claim that I know 100% about how all of the radar programs work, but I've watched their forums for a while and can give you a brief history of what has happened to them.  I wasn't too interested in how the macro programs worked, because well it's pretty damn easy to assume they just read windows messaged keystrokes or something.  I can't help it, when I hear that there are cheat programs for my favorite game, it intrigues me to learn how they do it, but anyway...<br />
<br />
Some radar programs (XUnleashed) started out by reading directly out of DAoC's memory space.  They'd suck out information that they cared about and then use it to generate a radar view.  This had a limitation that you must run the radar on the same machine as the game machine.  Thus it was always more risky because Mythic could search the process's memory space for intruders.<br />
<br />
Other radar programs (DAOCSkilla) started out by intercepting the network traffic from the game to the server.  They'd pick out packets of information and do the same thing.  This had the advantage of being able to run radar on a completely separate machine than the machine running the game.<br />
<br />
A little while ago Mythic converted to a high encryption level for their network traffic.  It completely broke radar programs like DAOCSkilla, and forced them to start reading memory similar to XUnleashed.  A yellow flag should have gone up here that Mythic was starting to deal with cheaters.  What this did for Mythic was pull all of the cheaters into a single room that they could attack altogether instead of multiple different rooms that had to be attacked in different locations.<br />
<br />
Whatever number of months later, Mythic announced its new anti-hacker technology.   <br />
<br />
The first wave hit mostly XUnleashed users.  There were &quot;I was banned&quot; threads on each of the forums.  DAOCSkilla users weren't touched in this wave, and most of them thought Mythic couldn't detect them because of it.  <br />
<br />
Then the second wave hit and alot of DAOCSkilla users were nailed (but not all for some reason).<br />
<br />
I don't know about XUnleashed, but DAOCSkilla changed their method of hacking into a hybrid of their first and second versions.  They went back to having a remote radar system that you could run on a second machine, but they reduced their memory intrusion immensely such that instead of reading the information directly out of memory, they instead only read the encryption key out of memory and then got out as quick as they could.  With the encryption key they could intercept traffic and decrypt it remotely.  This is how they work now.<br />
<br />
Then the third wave hit yesterday.  I haven't been to their forums today, but I didn't see anyone say &quot;I was banned&quot; yesterday, so I don't know if they were effected.<br />
<br />
So you can see, it's not a matter of Mythic relying on word-of-mouth.  It's just like an anti-virus company.  A new virus comes out, and they release an update.  Then a new virus comes out and they have to release another update.<br />
<br />
It would take a ton of man-hours to read through appeals for people who are suspected and manually watch them.  I'm not saying that they don't do this, but I would bet good money that this is not their most relied upon method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Alkeistarte</div><div class="date">08-31-04, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reposted from another discussion I had with someone- removed names for anonymity:  [to clarify not my words]<br />
<br />
DAoCSkilla actually sends data to the server, acting as a client. So the forumla to catch a cheater would be to slightly change what the client sends to the server on a patch day, and then watch for the old responses from people using DAoCSkilla. Sure, the really smart cheaters will wait until their program was fixed again, but this method would catch a lot of the &quot;novice&quot; or lazy cheaters. <br />
<br />
I am sure Mythic is primarily going after speed hackers and/or item dupers that attempt to modify the stream of data sent from the client to the server, or go after programs that attempt to actually modify the client (I don't know of any of these for DAoC -- the most famous one of recent note were the map hacks for War3 that modified the clients; Blizzard banned something like 10,000 accounts the first day they turned their detection software on). <br />
<br />
About the only way to sorta defend against passive sniffers is to continually change your packet formats. Unfortunately, most of these guys can update their crakers in a matter of hours, but it does make the process somewhat tedious. But now a days, to make matters worse, a lot of these cheat programs have auto-update features, so they patch themselves as fast as the game does. <br />
<br />
And while I hate cheating, I definitely don't support inventoring someone's private computer, either their memory or their harddrive, and sending the data to a 3rd party without asking permission. <br />
<br />
The only real solution is to design a client-server model where the client is relatively blind most of the time, and only gets &quot;need to know&quot; data. For example, if a player was facing N, and there was someone behind them to the S, neither the player nor the client would know that until they turned around. <br />
<br />
But again, the population of folks that actually take the time to setup and use these programs is actually relatively small. However, I do agree that even 1 or 2 groups using it in RvR can piss off a whole server. Unfortunately, there is very little that anyone can do.<br />
<br />
Rotating encryption or really any type of encryption is never a long term solution; it is just a deterant that causes the creaters of the cracking software to spend an afternoon (it literally takes them that long) to update their program. Plus, every time Mythic wants to change how it works, they must patch both the client and the server which means more of their time, more bandwidth spent on patching, and more server down time. All in all, it costs Mythic, and us, a lot more to chase this strategy than it does the crackers. <br />
<br />
I won't write the white paper here as to why its easy to crack any type of encryption or encoding Mythic might try but in short, any time you have a willing client (in this case, the game client) and access to an environment where you can load it into a debugger and periodically examine the memory, it is a pretty simple process to crack the encryption scheme being used. Mythic could make the process slightly more painful by changing the behavior based on seemingly random events, but either way, they have to signal the client its happening, and it can be detected. Again, they can make it painful, but never impossible. <br />
<br />
And actually, they are using UDP streams for much of the client - server data, so using any sort of strong encryption that is stream-based is out. Furthermore, while the CPUs in most of our systems would have no trouble with the extra load, it would probably add a very non-trival load to their servers. <br />
<br />
Mythic cannot scan your system and send data back without your permission... big, big privacy no no. All they can do is examine their own files, own memory space, and data being sent by their program, and data recieved by their servers. There is a lot you can do with that, but you cannot catch any passive listening programs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's obvious from the radar forums that what they are doing is working.<br />
<br />
PS. good discussion here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Alkeistarte</div><div class="date">08-31-04, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because I personally know more than 6 people who use it daily and several using the speedhack and they are all still around.</div></div><hr />

I'd be curious to research what is different about them.  If you don't want to, I understand.<br />
<br />
From what I've read, this latest wave has affected XUnleashed people, so evidentally the guy at XUnleashed has made some modifications to keep it working.<br />
<br />
So I guess the DAOCSkilla guys are still using it and not being caught - with the new remote server and encryption key intercept method.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure that breaks the rules of The Safehouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Red Alkeistarte</div><div class="date">09-01-04, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, prob does break something. Isn't it crazy that people use these things IN the game, but we cannot talk about it OUTSIDE of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnmish Gearbinder</div><div class="date">09-01-04, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not really crazy that the Forum Rules (http://www.thesafehouse.org/faq.php#42) prohibit posting anything advocating breaking the EULA of any software, primarily the MMOs discussed here.<br />
<br />
Not that I write the white paper here or anything... :pulid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ripre</div><div class="date">09-02-04, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I skimmed that link but the closest thing I can see is that they don't want people sharing viruses or hacks that harm one's computer, nor software that hacks the forum itself.  However, I can't find anything that says we cannot share information about software that breaks the EULA of other gaming software.  I probably missed it - do you mind pointing it out to me?<br />
<br />
This is a discussion of the effectiveness of Mythic's anti-hack technology, not a &quot;d00d wh4t h4x0r pr0ggies R y0 us1ng?&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I completely understand not wanting to share the info though, as Red, Gnmish and myself are probably not the only people reading this thread :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnmish Gearbinder</div><div class="date">09-02-04, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always been that way. The most appropriate mention is this -<br />
<br />
 You will not use these Forums for the purposes of sharing or distributing viruses, licenses, registration information, software keys, &quot;cracks,&quot; or other information designed to do harm to or allow unlawful access to any computer hardware, software, networks, or any other systems.<br />
<br />
The part in bold is the applicable section.<br />
<br />
This is the quote that I suggested toe'd the line...<br />
If you don't mind sharing, which programs are they using?<br />
Mentioning those programs, as opposed to XUnleashed and DAOCSkilla, would be bad because the aformentioned programs are already taken care of on Mythic's end. Ripre was asking for the names of the programs that we getting through the software.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ripre</div><div class="date">09-02-04, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will not use these Forums for the purposes of sharing or distributing viruses, licenses, registration information, software keys, &quot;cracks,&quot; or other information designed to do harm to or allow unlawful access to any computer hardware, software, networks, or any other systems.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a moderator chime in on this.  I may be wrong but:<br />
<br />
The parts to focus on in this paragraph are &quot;You will not use these Forums for the purposes of sharing or distributing&quot; ... &quot;information designed to&quot; ... &quot;allow unlawful access to any&quot; ... &quot;computer software&quot;.  In one sentance:<br />
<br />
You will not use these Forums for the purposes of sharing or distributing information designed to allow unlawful access to any computer software.<br />
<br />
The question is whether or not an EULA is a lawful entity, or if it is simply a contract between the company who wrote it and the person using the company's property, ie. &quot;Licensing&quot; their property.  I believe it is the latter,  of which the government has no care of; If you break the EULA then the only person to punish you is Mythic by cancelling your account.  The FBI can't break down your door to arrest you, if you should happen to use a speed-hack.<br />
<br />
Again, I kneel before a moderator if he/she tells me otherwise, but as far as this paragraph is concerned I don't believe it applies to software that breaks other software's EULA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">09-02-04, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnmish is correct in his reading of our rules. If you need an official staff reponse, how about a response from the Forums Administrator? ;)<br />
<br />
You will not use these Forums to share information about programs or services that break other softwares' EULAs.<br />
<br />
There, it's in plainer writing for you now.<br />
<br />
And, yes, these boards get scanned by many other entities besides those participating in the threads including lurkers and search engine bots. Some of these people may work for the games that get discussed here, some may even work for the legal departments of the games that discussed here. But I'm &quot;just saying&quot;. ;)</div></div><hr />
