<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I started a new alt (iksar fighter) and was having enough fun that I was seriously considering making him my main (added benefit of being able to start again on a low population server).  Heck, I'm still considering it but I've found that I really really miss tracking when it's gone.  It's just such an amazingly useful skill, especially in a game as quest and NPC oriented as EQ2.  It's been a great group ability too because in most groups I've been in where I'm the only scout after a while I get constant questions about tracking.  'Did any named respawn?  Are there any higher level creatures in the area?  I need to kill 'X mob' for a quest, do you see one on track?' etc etc.<br />
<br />
Awesome ability, and the latest patch makes it auto-increase with level.<br />
<br />
Tracking can be a little buggy though, as I've been unable to track before (click button and nothing would show up, zoning fixed the problem), had tracking trails that led to nowhere (usually when tracking a bugged mob), and been unable to see things on track that were right next to me (tracking overload maybe?).  Still, as far as scout abilities go this is one of my favorites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugannw</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah its an amazing ability that gives you a leg up and edge when hunting and doing quests, Ive often thought about what I would do without it and its definitely one of the things I love most about my rogue (and it makes role playing sense to me that a rogue should have a track ability, always thought they should in eq1 but that it would be unbalancing).<br />
<br />
Ive had a few buggy things happen too, a problem Im trying to figure out, is how to get the track window on screen and move forward without it scrolling within the tracking list.  I tried opening other windows to get the 'cursor' off the track window but it still often moves my track list up or down instead of moving my character forward.<br />
<br />
NPC's that are on a lower or higher level may not track properly as the line to follow goes into a wall or the ground.<br />
<br />
I often click on an npc and hit track and nothing shows up or it takes me to the wrong place, simply going back into the track window and trying again has always seemed to work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edgie</div><div class="date">11-19-04, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've decided to play a tank type instead of a rogue, like I usually do. I've definitely been enjoying him; it's such a fresh change of pace. Instead of avoiding damage, I'm actually trying to take it. I've also discovered that I'm a much better tank than any of the ones I've grouped with while leveling alts.  :D <br />
<br />
I swear, they just have no idea how to taunt. I can't be the only warrior who can switch targets, hit taunt, and switch back to my real target, am I?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-19-04, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I leveled a fighter to 8 and I'm also considering sticking with him (iksar, will probably go SK as well).  It's a tough choice, because most every class seems like a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
The problem with a tank who switches target (at least in my experience as an assassin) is that a lot of time instead of using a /assist macro people will just target the main tank and attack whatever they are attacking.  It really does work very well, but can be tricky if the tank decides to change targets often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why former rogues make some of the best tanks.  You're used to multi-tasking  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
My first main character in EQ1 was a druid, so sow and tracking were used a lot. My EQ1 cleric really missed tracking, although run3 made up for no sow. As a result, I really like having both abilities as basic to scouts - it makes sense from a roleplaying sense as well. Anyway, I was in a group doing a quest on IoR that required killing sharks and found tracking gets quite confusing when you have to keep coming up for air, probably that elevation thing.<br />
<br />
Went to Qeynos last night as a lvl 6 scout with 200%+ xp, did the citizenship quest and jumped to lvl 8, down side was something went wrong and I did not receive any of the items - book, dagger, or ring(?) that completing the quest did for my other characters.  Hailed the marshall afterwards and just got a 'well done' message.<br />

<br />
You were right, logged on, accepted the skill increase, and presto those rewards as well as another two quest rewards were added and now I am lvl 9, just by clicking a big + .  :D <br />
<br />
May later regret it, but decided agility seems to come easily so accepted stamina instead, probably a holdover from EQ1 thinking.<br />

<br />
In addition, I absolutely love the skill.  Its so usefull.<br />
<br />
Typically, if I am running a dungeon then I've been able to monitor track, slip into sneak, and call pulls for our tank.  At the same time, once you have significat knowledge of a zone you can clear PH's and using track monitor any named that spawn.  Its very true what they said about Scouts pre-release.  We are the single class that is meant to get you into a dungeon/zone, lead you about safely, and get you out if the shiat hits the fan.  Plus, I've helped many a friend and neighbor out with locating a quest mob via track.  It only takes a few and its a favor owed in the future.  You can't have enough of those.<br />
<br />
Can I not say enough about the Escape skill also :&gt;  I highly doubt any future group with balance and pure Survival/Escapism skills being stressed will not invovle a scout.  <br />

Pathfinding is what I miss the most while messing around on an alt closely followed by tracking (finding those pesky quest npc's is so handy).</div></div><hr />

OMG yes,  I was playing my 12 crusader alternate and even camped back to my rogue to use track to find a quest NPC   :kroe <br />
