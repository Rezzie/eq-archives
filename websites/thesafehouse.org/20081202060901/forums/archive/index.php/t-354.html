<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nimblefinger</div><div class="date">05-23-00, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All!<br />
<br />
I just wanted to share the experience of my first slaying of Emperor Crush of Crushbone! Teehee!<br />
<br />
Once upon a time...<br />
<br />
After slaying a couple of Legionaires outside the castle of Crushbone, I decided to use my sneak/hide combo to scout the inside. I crept in, but did not find anything in the throne room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; I thought, &quot;Instead of waiting for the orcs to spawn, I could always check out the tower...&quot;. Many times before, Emperor Crush and Ambasador D'Vinn had failed to see through my &quot;invisibility&quot; when they were out wreaking havoc on other players, and I figured I could safely sneak up there and take a screenshot of the big guys in the tower undetected.<br />
<br />
I slowly slinked up the spiral staircase, and I could see a part of Emperor Crush at the top of the staircase! &quot;Cool, he's there!&quot; I thought. Teehee!<br />
<br />
I get to the top of the staircase, only to discover that Emperor Crush was accompanied by an orc oracle! Wait a minute?!? Don't oracles see through invisiblilty? Uh oh...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh great! What am I gonna do now? I've never taken on Crush before, and there was an oracle there too. I don't wanna take em on while in the castle, 'cause who knows? D'Vinn may spawn at any time. If I run, there may be legionaires and emissaries downstairs that may have spawned. What to do? What to do? Well, there's always the window...<br />
<br />
Erol Flynn-like, Off I lept! Thank goodness I practiced my Safefall skill, Teehee! As soon as I landed, I made a bee-line towards the zone. I wasn't going to zone, however. I wanted to take Emperor Crush on, but I just wanted that &quot;escape hatch&quot; close by, should I need it. I hid and waited.<br />
<br />
Emperor Crush came around the corner, headed straight for me (no sight of the oracle, though. Maybe a lucky group took him on!). I quickly sized up the emperor...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By the time I could size him up, Emperor Crush was already wailing on me! He had seen through my attempt to hide in the shadows. The battle was joined!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the meantime, a small band of heroes arrived, probably chasing the Emperor Crush from the castle. They stopped short once they saw me engaging the emperor, and observed the battle.<br />
<br />
The battle was not going well, however. I managed to inflict significant damage to the emperor, but he was doing much more damage to me!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My health was deteriorating rapidly, and I had to pull back...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As soon as I started pulling back, I noticed that the band of heroes began their assault upon Emperor Crush. My first attempt to sneakily slip out of the battle failed, but the next attempt succeeded!<br />
<br />
I quickly started bandaging myself to repair the battle damage. There was no way I was going to zone to safety now! I had hurt Emperor Crush, and I wanted to be there to witness his death! Heck, I wanted to deal the killing blow!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The band of heroes had turned the tide of battle. They were driving Empreror Crush back towards the castle, and it looked like the emperor would not make it back alive. Siezing the opportunity (his exposed back looked so inviting!), I quickly dove in, and slipped in my dirk, deep into the emperor's back! <br />
<br />
The emperor fell to the ground, muttered a curse, and exhaled his last breath. Emperor Crush was dead, and I had dealt the killing blow! I let out a huge sigh of relief, and collapsed to the ground, exhausted from the intense battle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I thanked the band of heroes for their aid, and I continued to bandage the rest of my wounds. Oblivious to bandaging, all I could think of was that I took on the emperor!<br />
<br />
The Emperor is dead! Long live the Emperor!<br />

I zone to Ferrott and write something to my party about losing 1.2 bubbles of xp from that death... as I walk right past the 2 uber-guards in my full, swit-suit attirely wood-elven glory.<br />

But then I think, 'That's ok, the zone isn't far'<br />

---------------------<br />
Inside of 5 minutes, I lost 2.5 bubbles of xp total.  I was... a bit perturbed.<br />
<br />
Ok, wait, that wasn't so funny.<br />
<br />
How about my very first character, way back when, an enchantress.  At level 5 and having an awful time, an orc around level 5 or 6 spotted me and came to do battle.  I wasn't ready for him and figured I'd just cast my spiffy new 'lull' spell to make him calm down and leave me alone...<br />
<br />
Not much longer and,<br />
