Not a thin little spear or sword, but rather a rather oddly shaped somewhat large 'must really suck to get stuck with' HOOK. Ya know, the kind the villian in Peter Pan used. Suprise, Luffy somehow survives. THEN Croc sucks every bit of moisture from Luffy's body, and leaves him to crumble like dust in the wind. Oops! Dues Ex Machina, here's some water for ya! All better!

<br />
[spoiler:67041c3d1c]Like, 15 characters in Naruto &quot;die&quot; and luckily &quot;revive&quot; within a span of what? 30 chapters? Jesus.[/spoiler:67041c3d1c]<br />
<br />
Don't hate me for reading that, but One Piece needed defending from fanboys.<br />
<br />
One Piece, manga version at least, is kicking Naruto's ass to high heavens, and the recent Anime version of Sky Palace (yet to be fansubbed) is ****ing awesome.<br />
<br />
You can't really compare the two, anyway. Both are too different to those who watch a large variety of Shounen. What One Piece is trying to accomplish is nothing like what Naruto is.<br />
<br />
Lenilya none stay dead in comic or cartoon , jean grey in marvel is the best example<br />
<br />
I know you probably were just speaking in general, but this is not neccessarily true.  It applies to about 60% of the anime where an actual death occurs.<br />
<br />
Just a few off the top of my head - Last Exile, Saikano, Cowboy Bebop, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and probably the saddest deaths of them all, the ones that occur in Fullmetal Alchemist.<br />
<br />
That's the well known titles, among many lesser ones.</div></div><hr />

It's too bad they seem to be making a habit of the characters &quot;dying&quot; after their fights.  It pretty much makes me certain that NONE of them are actually dead, since I doubt two are gonna die in a row.

<br />
I used to think Tayuya was a girl, then i though she was a guy... then they addressed her as she so she's a girl until further notice. Same thing happend to me with Haku   :crazy<br />
<br />
The adult women kick ass for sure though. <br />
<br />
Although I think Gaara could whoop Crocodile's monkey ass into last easter, I still think Croc is WAAY cooler. His attacks just have a finesse to them that Gaara's &quot;automatic sand shield&quot; and &quot;sand eat you when i close my fist&quot; don't really have. Not to mention Croc handles getting hit ALOT better than Gaara does.</div></div><hr />

New opening and ending!<br />
<br />
[spoiler:c6c22094e9]Brief naruto/sasuke fight, mainly Itachi backstory, dealing with the time before he went psycho. Get a good glimpse of why Sasuke is so infatuated with him, he's been compared to Itachi his whole life (and his dad was a prick too!).<br />
<br />
That thing Itachi did with the sharingan right at the end was nifty looking.[/spoiler:c6c22094e9]</div></div><hr />

<br />
[spoiler:ae731eecb5]I think what Itachi did was another level of the Sharingan - unique to him as the strongest of the clan<br />
<br />
I really like the whole story around Itachi and Sasuke.. and it helps to understand Sasuke way better. He loved his brother more than anything, but still there was the thing that Itachi was the only one his father really accepted. His brother distancing from the clan and his father (and later killing all of the clan) really broke Sasuke's world - that's why he ended up being so solitary and introverted.[/spoiler:ae731eecb5]</div></div><hr />

[spoiler:673d4f5d32]In the new intro, where it shows the usual shot of all the genins gathered, there is no Chouji or Neji.  I guess they really are dead.  <br />
<br />
And with Sasuke gone(which is how its looking) looks like they have lost just enough people to compress the teams down.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think for the new teams?  I think they will split up Kibas team.  I think they will move Hinata to Lee's team since they are already familiar with someone with her move set.  Then move Shino to narutos team because they need a replacement &quot;mysterious cool guy&quot;.  And then stick Kiba on Shikas team.[/spoiler:673d4f5d32]</div></div><hr />

If it's what I think you guys are talking about, he is irrevelant. Someone from the past, not in the present time. There are only two Uchiha people. Probably will get into his story when this arc ends in the next five or six episodes. This was not a spoiler. It's not a big deal that I mentioned it.<br />
<br />
Besides, you guys really shouldn't be hopning the series does not &quot;slow down like One Piece or DBZ.&quot; Realize that there are only 10 to 15 at most episodes before the manga is caught up with. Then when you think 3 episodes to do a DBZ scream is bad, you'll commit suicide over either 1) 1-2 years without Naruto assuming it does get a second run (believe me, more popular series have gotten stopped before) or 2) You'll get almost a year or two's worth of filler which would be horrible too.<br />

As I said, DBZ and One Piece are not bad at all. One Piece's popularity shows quite the opposite. It's just that, for me at least, shows like that have to be watched in increments of 2-4 so that I don't feel like I went to a barber and came out with half a shave. I still love the shows, but there's a good reason why I only watch One Piece 4 episodes at a time. Naruto has done so well thus far, with both the fast advancement of plotline and action and the fact that these DBZ-esque episodes are few and far between (I totally see the significance of Sasuke's backstory...I'm just getting itchy).

On a more relevant topic:<br />
[spoiler:aea85f8e10]Since there was a secret scroll in a secret area providing the history of the Mangekyou Sharingan, I got the implication that the first awakening happened a long time ago. Notice that the two statues Naruto and Sasuke are fighting on imply a legend of old, and are not simply Kakashi and Gai. If the Mangekyou was awakened in Kakashi, then it would probably seem like more of a new toy than a powerful demon too taboo for dinner conversation. I'd more expect one of the two statues to have possessed the Mangekyou...though this really is a minor point and has nothing to do with the way this plot is going.[/spoiler:aea85f8e10]</div></div><hr />

Sakura could probably kick everyone in Naruto's ass.<br />
<br />
Of course, certain conditions would need to be met, she would need to be able to plan ahead at least one step in a fight. But a battle-experienced Sakura vs Itachi? Itachi would be owned.<br />

<br />
We're talking about a magical girl taking on a stone-cold killer ninja. I'm wondering how she could possibly defend against his speed, his justus, his murderous intent, ect.<br />
<br />
Ah well, if anyone got CCS fansubs, drop me a pm, cause now I'm intrigued.   :crazy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-27-05, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to realize, watching the series iteself shows a &quot;cute&quot; kind of Sakura.  But, all of the cards she has grants her a power, as far as we have seen, that easily matches Gaara's sand jutsus, fish guy's water jutsus, Itachi's illusion sharingan, if not far surpass them, and she has a ton more to boot.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, she can fly, she has a speed and jump card to counter Itachi's speed, etc.<br />
<br />
But even if his speed overpowered hers, he would not even be able to get a mile away from Sakura.<br />
<br />
Well, it's idle ********, nothing worth watching the series for, still, I recommend the show anyway because it's one of the better Mahou Shoujo series. I do prefer Futari wa Pretty Cure though.</div></div><hr />

my philosophy(sp?) is if you can't do the show without a certain character....don't kill him off, then magically bring him back. It never works dammit!<br />

either kill the character off and have the story end, or don't kill him off at all.<br />

<br />
It's a Shounen anime. All shounen anime are fundamentally the same. Just like how all Shoujo anime are the same. Just like how all the Sci-Fi anime are all the same.<br />
<br />
Shounen anime means it will have fights. It means a story is optional. DBZ is a great shounen anime, just like Naruto is a great shounen anime. If you don't like shounen anime, then don't even comment on it. Tell me what you enjoy, and I'll tell you what every series you watch is &quot;just the next y anime series.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-11-05, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm watching both... Speed Grapher had a brillant first three episodes. The others so far do not compare, but still are above average and very interesting. Saiga and Ginza are a really fun couple.<br />
<br />
As for Basilisk, I've watched a few episodes, it's hard to follow the story and I'm finding it uninteresting so far. It's mostly just niche anime, I think.<br />
<br />
Honestly, to me the current series that are the real winners are:<br />
<br />
Fushigi Hoshi no Futago Hime: cute, with a layer of cute, and some toppings of cute, and some cute forks and cute napkins and a cute table to go with it. It's so cute that all the hardcore naruto fans in this thread will die from a second or two of it.<br />
<br />
However, it's right up my alley :p It's a mahou shoujo anime, about twin princesses from the Sun Kingdom whose light is apparently going out. <br />
<br />
Hachimitsu to Clover (Honey &amp;amp; Clover): Ok, some of the greatest male characters in the history of anime are here. Morita is too awesome to be called awesome. Hagu is cute, in a creepy serial killer sort of way. Well, that's a weird explaination, but as cute as she is, she's always doing things that give me the serial killer vibe for some reason even though I love her. Supposedly it's a Josei anime, which means for young women (16-25ish I'd guess.)<br />
<br />
Futakoi Alternative: Everyone who picked this up without watching the original Futakoi is totally missing out. Sure, it works well standalone, but with the &quot;alternate universe prequel&quot; Futakoi watched, it is so much more funny. Twins everywhere, explosions, fanservice, and mad style.<br />
<br />
Gokujou Seitokai: All girls school anime, the style reminds me of Sensei no Ojikan and Azumanga Diaoh. But it's a fun anime to watch. No fanservice to speak of, well, there is that Payapaya scene.. oh my! Naughty!<br />
<br />
Bokusatsu Tenshi! Dokuro-chan!: Good god, my eyes! My brain! My other brain! Bloody and diarrahea mayhem!  :blink <br />
<br />
There's a lot of other series, but those are the only ones i can recommend off the top of my head. Of course, my tastes are much more... varied... than the naruto fanboys... so most of the above stuff will probably look as appealing as a chidori up your ass.</div></div><hr />

Apparently Steve Blum is on the English cast (Spike from Bebop).  No word on if he's going to be a characters voice or a script guy, but it certainly is a good sign that CN won't butcher Naruto like Fox did One Piece.  Steve has to be one of the most recognizable voices in dubbed anime, so its nice to see him on staff.<br />
<br />
Here's the text from NarutoFan btw:<br />
Steve Blum, more famously known as Spike Spiegel from the Cowboy Bebop franchise revealed during his panel at ACEN yesterday that he is part of the cast for the Naruto anime series that is set to be coming to Cartoon Networks Toonami this fall. It is unknown what character he will play, or if he will just be doing a script adaptation as he has done for ShoPro Entertainment (now VIZ Media) on the MegaMan NT Warrior series. As of now he is the only member of the Naruto USA team that is known, this should be interesting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">05-15-05, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hold out no hope 'till I see the final product. It could be a great translation, like FLCL where the japanese refrences actually were replaced with equally odd english refrences that made a sort of odd sense (crystal pepsi!), or they could dumb it down to the 9-15 year old demographic, and make it America Dragon Piece Ninja Z ... We shall see.<br />
<br />
Ten bucks they change the jutsu names to something really, really, terribly stupid. They could butcher the rest of the series, but in the name of each and every one of the six-hundred and sixty-six layers of the abyss, at LEAST get that part right...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-16-05, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or they could just do accurate translations of the jutsu names and it would STILL be lame.<br />

&quot;Better watch out, or Sasuke will use his CopyWheelEye and his ThousandBirds to defeat you Naruto, and even your SpiralSphere won't help!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">05-16-05, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You misunderstand.<br />
<br />
I was meaning more along the lines that, instead of keeping the jutsu names in japanese, they'd change them into something else, like your examples.<br />
<br />
And the following goes out to the U.S. translation team: <br />
&amp;lt;japanese&gt;<br />
&amp;lt;THEY'RE FSCKING NINJA! THEY CAN MUTTER ARCANE SOUNDING THINGS AND KICK ASS AFTERWARD! IT DOESNT MATTER IF IT'S IN ENGLISH! SHARINGAN SOUNDS COOLER THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD EVER COME UP WITH, SO DON'T BOTHER TRYING! IT WONT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BUYING YOUR TOYS AND BOOKS AND OTHER ASSORTED MERCHANDISE IF A *NINJA* SPEAKS *JAPANESE* IN ORDER TO PREFORM A *JUTSU*!!&gt;<br />
&amp;lt;/japanese&gt;<br />

I hate these crappy fillers because they always contradict the manga and are always poorly written and animated. The episode before explained exactly why Naruto should no longer try to reach Sasuke, yet now they are after Sasuke again the very next episode? Oh, sorry it's a secret S class mission (they give S class missions to genins now?) meant to find Orochimaru's lair, but where they can't use any ninjustu and give themselves away. Don't mind that they have the same ninja costumes as always.<br />
<br />
And yeah, everytime a stupid looking character with no point comes along, it should give the hint to anime-only watchers that it's filler</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-28-05, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">upcoming manga filler <br />

Isn't that technically impossible?  Filler is by definition that which is not in the manga.  How can the manga have filler?</div></div><hr />

Ok if you read that part DON'T read the next part since it's major spoilers<br />
<br />
[spoiler:f73c78e1e3]It's the story of how Kakashi received the sharingan during the Great Ninja Wars (btw he's a sword fighter in those days ^_^). And you get to see Yondaime in action, and why he's known as the Yellow Flash.[/spoiler:f73c78e1e3]<br />

And yes, the mangas can have filler. Those Omake's you see like the one where Team 7 tries to look at Kakashi's face behind the mask is an example. Bleach episode 33 was an omake/manga filler episode.</div></div><hr />

This past weekend at Anime North in Toronto Ontario, NarutoFan correspondant NamaeX was in attendance and caught up with a few big names in the anime scene including Vic Mignogna (Edward Elric in Fullmetal Alchemist, Brolly in DBZ) who has confirmed to us that he has been actively pursuing a role in the Naruto anime series, and also that Steve Blum (Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop) will voice Kakashi (previously Steve Blum was only confirmed to be working as a script adaptor). According to Vic, the voice of Uzumaki Naruto in the series has also been cast, however he does not recognize the name from anything. NamaeX also had a chance to talk with Scott McNeil (DBZ's Piccolo) who confirmed the Naruto anime series is being done a in Los Angeles California studio.</div></div><hr />

In the mall there, there is a store with a bunch of collectibles (mecha robot models, gashaphon, figurines, plushies, etc) and the kid (about 14-15 or so) next to me asked the person  behind the counter to get the Naruto headband because he wanted to buy it.<br />
<br />
His father was standing next to him, and when the kid was about to ask if he could buy it, the father said, &quot;What is this? Is this one of those geeky stuff?&quot; and the kid decieded not to buy it and left the store. I could tell he was embarassed, haha.<br />
<br />
What was more depressing was, I, a working adult, was standing next to him looking at the Yamato Bottle Fairy figures, Ikkitousen's Ryomou (not that I liked the series.. it was horrible, but it looked nice), etc. I was like... I'm not sure if I should feel bad about this or not.  :beatup</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure what R1 means, but I'm gonna guess it means uncut.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I can never be sure wether I'm gonna buy DVDs or not when they come out.  For Naruto, I'll buy those when they come out, not so sure on One Piece, even uncut.  In the meantime, its not like I'm using my bandwidth for anything else, may as well get the best sub I can for burning to DVD, for me and my friends to watch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-05-05, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">R1 is the region coding for DVDs. I.e. R2 is Japan and some other areas, R1 is USA and Canada? and others, etc. Basically, if an anime is getting a R1 release, it's licensed for america.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">09-05-05, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah I see.  Well, unless a show is getting an uncut release, complete with subtitled version(like all the later DBZ discs are), then I won't be buying them.<br />
<br />
Naruto is getting that, but not until about 6 months after they start releasing the edited TV versions on disc.</div></div><hr />

Even tho it is edited it is still cool that it got licensed and is going to be shown on TV for the first time in the US.

I liked the attack names and and all the character names/titles were intact.  The only voice that bothered me at all was Naruto's.

The only voice I noticed that was annoying was Naruto's and that wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been.  He sounded like an annoying 13 year old....which is what Naruto is at this stage in the show.  I'm hoping they deepen the voice a little as the series progresses, that or make his language a tad bit more mature.</div></div><hr />

So that means we'll have had one storyline for each of the teams since the Sasuke chase arc ended.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that will be the end of the filler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-17-05, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about that. There's no good stopping point in the manga so far, and its not far enough into the story that the manga won't catch up too fast.<br />
<br />
But one can hope.</div></div><hr />

New Opening!<br />
...everyone looks creepy as hell in the first part...<br />
<br />
New Ending!<br />
Aww, aint they cute?<br />
<br />
Not bad. Rock Lee does a little bit of his thing, someone gets freakin' nailed with a Rasengan, creepy kid tells a story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">10-06-05, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">New opening is passable, though the video for it sucks because its half clips from the show. That's just lazy. New ending is crap.<br />
<br />
I kinda liked this episode. I think this story arc isn't actually too bad. If anything, I think that the main problem is everything is rushed. They have a decent story here, but because they try to do the whole thing in 4 episodes, it feels so choppy. I think this one could have been good if it had been given more time to work with.<br />
<br />
Plus, Unconcious Lee was pretty sweet!</div></div><hr />
