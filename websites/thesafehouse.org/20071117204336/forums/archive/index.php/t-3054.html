<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Snibbs Quickinshot</div><div class="date">04-29-03, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading that humorous semi-Cthulhu thread in Logged Out it got me thinking back to my first and last attempt to get my friends into it. The game went horribly (I think the &quot;free module&quot; i got with the corebook was meant for like level 5's, had to constantly save friends and give 'em subtle hints  ) and ended up as a flop. The game seems to require a really really good DM to say the least, which, unfortunately, I cannot say I am. <br />
<br />
So, thinking about giving it a second chance because I think it's a really cool game but want it to go smoothly this time. Anyone able to spare some advice or whatnot? Anything that might make it go smoother and easier for me to DM, and the players to play, would be a much appreciated help.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, btw, we were playing the d20 version because d6 tends to be a huge pain and I avoid it if i can find versions of games in d20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't going to be any help ... but playing a horror RPG is probably the most difficult thing you can try and do.  The DM has to be very into it and be a great storyteller.  The players have to be into it and it helps if they've all read Lovecraft at one time or another.<br />
<br />
Ok, I actually do have some advice.  Don't be too descriptive, especially about monsters (don't ever show a picture of one!).  I think one of Lovecraft's high points is that he left a lot up to the reader's imagination and it works well.  Of course, this only applies if you're atually trying to create a sense of horror/suspense.<br />

But what do you see as bad about the d20 system? Is it more limited or something? What, exactly, makes the d6 system better than d20. I guess I can try the d6 if i have to but from looking at Shadowrun it just seems really really really confusing. =|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lady Kaylan</div><div class="date">04-29-03, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It can be confusing at first ... it took me forever to get adjusted to it (and West End's Star Wars) since I was so used to play AD&amp;amp;D ... just try and clear your head of all the D20 mumbo-jumbo and try and start fresh.<br />
<br />
Chaosium has held the Lovecraft license for a very long time and they know what they're doing and I think it reflects in their products.  I'm not quite sure how WotC also has the right to publish stuff, but to me their books feel more like &quot;people will buy this because it says Cthulhu&quot; than any real love or deep knowledge of the lore.  Also, there's many more books and such for the Chaosium series.  D20 just has 2 (3?) books ...<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I just want to add that I played the Chaosium first, that's probably why I prefer it.  My best advice is to check out both versions on .PDF and see which you like better.  There's really no horrible problem with the D20, I just think it doesn't fit well with the system. Edited by: Lady Kaylan at: 4/29/03 7:19:35 pm</div></div><hr />

  Truer words have never been spoken.<br />
<br />
I've only played CoC once...but I'm a fan of the whole horror, Lovecraftian Genre. The system is not for everyone. Some players need more hack, speed up grades, shooting two guns, flaming swords, and a snow balls chance in hell against really bad monsters. CoC doesn't really offer that.<br />
<br />
 I'd suggest really examining your players, and find out which ones actually enjoy survival/mystery horror, and which ones are just there for the ride, because they are the ones that will bring your session down, and detract from the atmosphere that is essential to running a good CoC game. If people aren't scared of the stuff you are doing to them, the no-eyed, elucidian tentacled horror from the depths isn't going to have the impact it should have. If a player fails an insanity check, and goes &quot;aw god damnit, now what am I going to do&quot;, then I'd say he's the wrong player for the game.  It's like every chatroom cliche crawled into Safehouse to die. -Caowyth<br />

As everyone else is saying, it's really about the DM and players wanting to play the genre.  Heck, we've gone for several hours without rolling dice at all when the plot is moving nicely.<br />

Don't really matter what system you play in. In order to play in a Cthulhu type game , you have to WANT to play in a Cthulhu game. In the end they system doesn't matter, if you meet a Deep One it's all over.<br />

<br />
Why? Everyone dies in Cthulhu games... or goes insane. You have to enjoy and want this sort of thing. You should have just let people die. Then they'll either enjoy it or they won't.<br />
<br />
In order to survive Cthulhu games you have to look at nothing and do nothing. So what's the point?  <br />

<br />
I think I gonna go another try at it with d20 before I check out the d6. One last thing though, I hear about people playing d20, d6, et al. games online. Is there some special program that you can use that has automatic dice rolls and such? Or people just use chatrooms like AIM or whatnot to do it? I might wanna check it out because I really am muuuuuch better at telling a story through writing than I am through talking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vorashus</div><div class="date">05-26-03, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the Nocturnum campaign module is amazing.<br />
<br />
Im a big Lovecraft fan, but only started playing CoC a few months before the d20 version was released, so i moved over to that immediately. <br />
<br />
Like someone said, Horror is the hardest genre to both play and storytell, imo. I ran two campaigns of CoC that lasted probably about 10 sessions apiece, with 3 or 4 players, varying. Horror/suspense was a new genre for a couple of my players. different opinion between them and the more experienced players was a problem (a lot of &quot;screw researching in the library all day about that creepy old house. lets just go burn the @#%$ down!&quot;)<br />
<br />
anyways... i had just about given up on CoC until i ran across the Nocturnum campaign module. Its definately one of the best modules i have ever read. It has 18 distinct chapters (which turned into 20+ long games, so its a lot of bang for your buck), a ton of information and mood, and many many differing scenarios depending on how and when your party reacts to a situation. Things such as newspaper clippings that you can copy and give to your players as clues really add to the 'investigator' feel of it.<br />
<br />
30 minutes into the first chapter and my players were nervous, completely creeped out, and looking at me like i was the devil. that only got worse as the night progressed   its a ton of fun and i cant recommend it enough if you want to give CoC a try.<br />
