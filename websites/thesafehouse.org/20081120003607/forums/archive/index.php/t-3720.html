<br />
The first mob in the outer courtyard, its on a 12hr timer I'm told, and trackable from the entrance, but I don't know the name.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to help out so I can spot it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, since this giant rock-man has like several million hps, it takes a long ass time to beat him down.  With 5 full groups, we started beating on him, about 10 mins later, I let loose with this in raid channel:<br />
<br />
&quot;/yawn, good morning all!... OMG! I'm still here? On the same mob?&quot;<br />
<br />
That apparently got old after the 8th time I did that.</div></div><hr />

Not like you're going to want to kill him more than once per raid, and you'll get a key from him every time you go kill Thall Va Xakras anyway.<br />
<br />
Have your pullers save the keys.  Being on the keyring apparently isn't enough.  I have north wing and tower keys on my keyring (deleted keys) and can't open the doors reliably.</div></div><hr />

Had NP opening any of the doors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Marcin00</div><div class="date">08-21-03, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You probably lockpicked a lot of the doors then.  North Wing Key opens the door to blob1 just fine from keyring, but it'll do nothing unless clicking the key itself on the doors towards TVX etc.  I'm assuming keyring can only be assigned to interact with one item even though the key itself can open multiple doors, gg coding.</div></div><hr />

We had several rogues all with Lockpick skill increasers and none of them were able to open ANY of the doors once inside the Palace.  Is this a bug?  Any information would be great!<br />

Thanks!<br />

 We had the same thing on bertoxx - the north and south doors inside the palace were unpickable by any of our rogues who have maxxed LP skill and mech lock picks.<br />
We tried eye of zomm, /target mobname (to try and agro a mob so it opened the door, and various other things.  In the end nothing worked apart from getting a friend in another guild to come and open the door for us. <br />
 We went in, wasted TVX and gained 4 keys from the 2 mobs by him.  They all opened the aforementioned north &amp;amp; south doors.  (Had the rogues SoS and open the door to put them on the keyring).<br />

<br />
Key to North Wing, which is actually to the west (they flipped map the wrong way like PoK), drops from 2 guards to Thall Va Xakra's.<br />
<br />
North Tower key drops from the guards of Diabo Xi Xin Thall, and I think also the guards of Diabo Xi Xin and Diabo Xi Va? Forgot.</div></div><hr />
