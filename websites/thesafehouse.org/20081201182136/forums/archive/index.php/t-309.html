<br />
Full Blackened Iron (including boots and crown)<br />
Ravenscale Bracer<br />
Serpentine Bracer<br />
Bloodstained Mantle<br />
2 Jagged Bands<br />
Obsidian Shard<br />
Stilletto of the Bloodclaw<br />
Dragoon Dirk<br />
Purity Belt<br />
Spiked Collar<br />
Scout Cape<br />
2 Onyx Earrings<br />
Grot Mask<br />
Mask of Deception<br />
<br />
As you can see I have many low level items but almost as many items geared for levels 20+<br />
All this with 4 1/2 Days played(/played)<br />
The things I owe to other people are Bloodclaw, JAgged bands, Serp, Elf Hides. I traded a Combine Ls for bands which was given to me by an old guildmate. I traded a Darkwood Bow for serp which a druid gave to em for free.  ELf Hides were given to me by a wizzard. My guild leader gave me a Bloodclaw this morning. I am extremely well equiped now and I wanted to let everyone know its possible to do so with little help. I just wanted to show all of the sceptics who jump to conclusions when they see someoen my level well equiped. Its often twinking but not always. Also to all you young rogues out there...with a little persistance and luck you can get alot. Just a little message. May Bristlebane Cloak ye all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two, since when is being given items by guildmates and real-life friends defined as persistence and luck? Persistence is killing 500 bandits in West Karana. Luck is stumbling across an unclaimed corpse in Kithicor and looting a superior no-drop weapon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sabatini</div><div class="date">03-23-00, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Persistance and luck??? LOL Not even remotely. You had high level guildmates give you items you either used directly or traded for more useful items. Now tell us how folks without high level friends might do the same and you might have an arguement.<br />
<br />
Doesn't mean I hate ya for being twinky. You seem like a swell fellow. But even though I have items nearly as good, it took substantially longer than 4 days for me to clock my first 11 levels and some truly shrewd negotiations (and severe luck) to turn newbie level take into something profitable and useful.<br />
<br />
Sadly your post reads more like a brag list of your goodies than an informative item gaining guide for newer rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tadyen</div><div class="date">03-24-00, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I said only items given to me by anyone were the BLoodclaw, Gloves, Jagged Bands.<br />
A High level druid gave me the bow to trade for serps, that was luck, he auctioned to whole zone that anyone under level 20 should send him a number between 1-100. I won the roll. Everything else I got by buying low sellign high. Maybe if some people read my post I had already disclaimed for these 4 items. Everything else is mine all mine. No one helped me camp anything either.<br />
I belive in the concept if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. I posted this to show some of the newer rogues that it is possible to get those items they dream about. I have gotten 75% of my items by finding really good deals. I didn't mean to come across as a baragger. I'll apologize for that. As a matter of fact I'll just become an observer because it seems that if I make a comment I have to be attacked by people with nothing better to do than half read a post and make a comment. And as far as twinking is concerned I don't think my guild leader giving me a weapon he had lying in the bank that no one else needed as twinking. as for the Combine, I paid 30pp for that. So about half off /auc price. Right now I am working on getting my level 12 friend Elf Hides and an Obsid Shard. I'm using my contacts and our pooled resources to do this. Does this mean I am twinking him? I think not. I've learned that if you try to tell newbie rogues how to get better equipment you'll be attacked for it. I'm so sick of those high levelers out there that bitch because they didn't have it this easy. Its not easy. I wouldn't take an offer If I didn't think I</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tadyen</div><div class="date">03-24-00, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...would be getting the bettetr end of it. As for persitance, I killed orc centurions even when they ceased to give em exp just to get rusty and cloth for my funds. I got lucky when I have stumbled across guard corpses and froglocks corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Delph</div><div class="date">03-24-00, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You were GIVEN a bloodclaw, elfhide gloves, and jagged bands.<br />
<br />
Now, I play onLanys T'Vyl, I am a level 34 rogue, and I STILL use a dragoon dirk because there are hardly any bloodclaws in circulation. Believe me, I have the money to buy one, but there are NONE for sale. I have camped Drelzna 5 times for about 2 to 3 hours a spell, and NOluck. Did get a shortspear of 7, but I would rather have the Dragoon Dirk for the bonuses. Point is, I am level 34 and at this time would KILL for something you got for free.<br />
<br />
The elfhide gloves I bought for 75 platinum. A pair of jagged bands cost me 140 platinum. So you got well over 450platinum worth of goods for free. The other posters on thios board are inquiring how a young rogue on a new server, or a rogue new to Everquest would go about getting 450platinum worth of free goods.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sabatini</div><div class="date">03-24-00, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly. Imagine this scenario: You just bought EverQuest and roll up your first character, a rogue. You have no real friends yet, certainly no guild, and probably aren't all that sure what a guild is yet. But through luck or whatever, you find the Safehouse and come here looking for advice on how to get some better equipment.<br />
<br />
Could such a person have read your post and been able to figure out how to get themselves such good things? (Not the gifts, the other stuff.) No of course not. <br />
<br />
What they need are reliable methods they can do at their level to get useful items. A good example was a post I read here (forgive me for not recalling the author) about how to get a nice nodrop magical rapier from Kithcor woods. With a little luck, most new rogues could read that post and figure out how to gain one for themselves. That's the kind of info people need.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if this comes off as flaming you, it's not really my intention. Just that if you post thing about how anyone can get good equipment, try to include some useful tips on how it can be done. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tadyen</div><div class="date">03-24-00, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see what you mean, as for your point Delph, I play Fennin Ro, everything is in pretty good circulation except for Ravenscale. You should consider upgrading to a Obsidian Shard. I believe at your level Shardwing wouldn't be a problem. Or even a Crookstinger. Both are rare spawns but worth it. Crookstinger is 4 23(delay?) but it procs with weak poison, Obsidian Shard has a 30 dmg proc. Put your Dirk in your ranged slot when your not using knives. Make sure you remove the hotkey from your pad first or you risk throwing a dragoon dirk! I&quot;ll rethink this post and put up soem usefull newbie tips then. I have no idea what I was thinking making this post in the begining but oh well, it was my birthday, probally was bragging. I apologize. May Bristlebane Cloak ye all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those two weapons you mentioned sound fun. I'll have to go looking for them one day...</div></div><hr />

Thanks for B-Day Wishes!</div></div><hr />

He actually spawns in the hallway above the &quot;Predator Room&quot;. He conned yellow to a 22 and is actually a very easy camp.<br />
<br />
And getting good items is easy:Luck<br />
<br />
  But items come in 3 categories: Things to sell because you don't need them<br />
Things you would use but the profit gained for sellign it is so much it aways teh value (but make you sure you get some type of replacement)<br />
And finally: Things you're gonna use <br />
<br />
These can come from buying in them, or looting them.<br />

<br />
BUT today I was in the spider room if Lower Guk, because a level 50 cleric was in the assassin room (farming I guess :( ) and he shouts &quot;WOW got an SBD already!&quot; 20 minutes later, &quot;WOW two SBDs in a row!&quot; Asked if he was selling, but he wanted items, go figure :(  So is the life of a rogue, ... =) Delph F'Elon, Teir'Dal assassin Extraordinaire.Lanys T'Vyl</div></div><hr />
