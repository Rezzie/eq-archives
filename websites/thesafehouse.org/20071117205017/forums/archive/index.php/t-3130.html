<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">11-04-03, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I do have one that I use for them all.  I cant say its the best one out there but it does what I like it to do.<br />
<br />
Typically three sheets.  First is Stats, Feats, Levels, a Random Die Roller, and basically everything on a paper sheet except the skills.<br />
Second is Skills List that figures all the mods based upon how many ranks you put in it, plus has a &quot;Result&quot; column that works in conjunction with the Random Die Roller.<br />
<br />
I have seen some out there that calculate the cross class skills based upon your classes.  Also calculating the max HP and how many attribute points you add and such.  I just didnt want to mess with anything that big for every character I had. (I think I have 15-20 characters on my HD for AD&amp;amp;D alone, and thats not counting NPC's for my campaign either.  Those are actual PC's that ive played at one time or another)<br />
<br />
If you want mine I could probably get it to you.  But if you do a google search for &quot;Excel AD&amp;amp;D Character Sheet 3ed&quot; you may find a better variety.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh. 3.5, mine is for 3.0.  Try the search though for 3.5  Youll find a few to choose from Edited by: Urusai  at: 11/4/03 8:14 am</div></div><hr />
