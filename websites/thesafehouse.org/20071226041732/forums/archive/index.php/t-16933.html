<br />
In addition to the two new shows, Adult Swim anime programming director Kim Manning has disclosed titles that they aren't planning on acquiring and mentioned some movies they plan to air.<br />
<br />
Adult Swim anime programming director Kim Manning disclosed some of Adult Swim's anime plans for 2005 during a message board Q&amp;amp;A session on January 20.<br />
<br />
Cartoon Network has acquired the rights to broadcast the remaining episodes of Inu Yasha (episodes 105-167) but no time-line for their broadcast was given.<br />
<br />
Manning explained that Adult Swim has no plans to seek the USA TV rights to Naruto or the Fullmetal Alchemist movie. Also, she confirmed that, due to inadequate ratings, they won’t be acquiring any more episodes of Case Closed but will keep rerunning the 50 they have already shown. She said there are no plans for Adult Swim to produce a 3rd season of Big O, and that they have allowed the rights to Outlaw Star to expire. She also said they still plan to air the Metropolis anime movie, the first 2 Inu Yasha movies and the Cowboy Bebop movie this year. The Bebop movie is planned for this coming fall but she didn’t say when the other movies would run.<br />

<br />
Thanks to Herb for this news.<br />
<br />
Clarification: Please note that Manning stated that there are no plans yet to acquire TV rights for Naruto, the Full Metal Alchemist movie or Robotech. Regarding Naruto she added, &quot;I think Naruto is an amazing series.&quot; <br />
<br />
From the discussion forum I found these quotes interesting...<br />
<br />
AS picked up Samurai Champloo and Paranoia Agent<br />
<br />
Here's a quote I'm surprised no one mentioned from that AdultSwim.com post.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven't made a single edit to Fullmetal Alchemist.&quot; -Kim Manning</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-24-05, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope neither get Naruto...  :hmph</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glip the Gnome</div><div class="date">01-24-05, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I already own all the Robotech DVDs, but it'll be cool to see them on TV again.<br />
<br />
I kinda wish someone would start showing the old Exo-Squad cartoons too.  I really miss those, they were surprisingly good (and unfortunately short lived)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd love to see Robotech on TV again...not quite prepared to go out and spend 50 to 60 bucks on the DVD set.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telurinon</div><div class="date">01-25-05, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just say no to more giant robot anime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">01-25-05, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forgive him, he means &quot;Say yes to the OG Giant Robot Anime&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">01-25-05, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is good giant robot anime, then there's the americanized 'monster of the week' style giant robot show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">01-25-05, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Americanized?  Haha the Japanese practicly invented &quot;monster of the week.&quot; <br />
<br />
And oh yeah... while it's not anime at all, since it was mentioned I have to comment: Exo-Squad WAS great and really deserved a better ending than to get cut off right at the beginning of a new plot line.<br />
<br />
Regarding Naruto... everyone should just accept now that 4kids has it licensed.  They have a track record with the Jump anime adaptations here.  YuGiOh, Shaman King, One Piece... I think the only reason they didn't get Yu Yu Haksuho was due to lack of interest at the time it was sold, and DBZ wasn't up for grabs by the time 4kids came onto the scene.  So if it doesn't end up with 4kids, you'll be pleasently surprised.  But given recent history, preparing yourselves now would not be a bad idea.</div></div><hr />
