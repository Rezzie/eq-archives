<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arafain</div><div class="date">04-12-04, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">currently, they're dependent off the mainhand weapon delay - but that doesn't seem to matter since they do about the same amount of damage regardless of their own stats (as in, a 12 dmg dagger hits for the same as a 30 dmg sword).  I offhand a DBP most of the time for the +2 agility.<br />
<br />
Word on the street, however, is that this will get changed with the next push.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver (retired)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lurik</div><div class="date">04-12-04, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hold on.. a 12 damage dagger is doing the same damage as a 30 damage sword?  Is every weapon like this or would you assume it's because rogues generally have more agility (deciding their damage) than a warrior has more strength (which decides his damage).   And all talents are the same? (Or are talents even in beta?)<br />
<br />
However, if the mainhand and offhand are linked, then using something high damage with a speed of 2.00 offhand would be killer while using a lower damage, but speed 1.30 in the mainhand.   Which is getting changed, the fact that daggers are doing the same damage as sword or the independance of offhand/mainhand? Lurik Crim`Tal<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arafain</div><div class="date">04-13-04, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see you are operating under a misconception.  It's only in the offhand that 12 damage daggers are doing the same damage as 30 damage swords - mainhand weapons operate normally.<br />
<br />
Here's how it currently works -<br />
<br />
Main Hand - totally normal.  Weapons do their listed damage and swing at their listed delay.<br />
<br />
Offhand - swings at delay of mainhand, does roughly the same damage as an unarmed attack, regardless of which weapon is equipped in it.<br />
<br />
What's getting changed - both.  Offhand weapons will swing independently and do damage independently.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver (retired)<br />
