<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ralis DeNatharr</div><div class="date">04-28-02, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am making a Shadowblade for the PvP server. I've been thinking baout spec and this is what I came up with:<br />
<br />
39 CS - Don't need more, later styles suck. Can get to high 40s /w items<br />
39 Axe - Higher damage with a 2h Axe on opening CS. Also in the 40s /w items<br />
40 Stealth - An effective 50. Raising it to 40 to get Safe Fall 4<br />
41 Env - Also an effective 50. I really want to use the best poisons available because a lot of my friends who solo RvR say it's the env that kills them when attacked by a stealther.<br />
5 LA - Leftover pts<br />
<br />
Here is my reasoning to use this spec. I know for a fact that 2h weapons do much better damage than one handed on the opening moves. After I pull off my PA chain my plan is to switch to 2 axes coated with 2 more poisons and apply those to the target. This should work since LA always swings. After that I switch back to my 2h axe to finish the target off.<br />
<br />
Theoretically if that all works I will get 3 poisons on the target and get huge damage from using a 2h axe to fight with. I know switching weapons causes one to go out of combat so maybe switching 2 times will not be viable. What do you experienced assassins know about switching 2 times in a fight? Is it a good way to get killed?<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
I also have another spec in mind which once again shoots for high Envenom but this time I get LA up high enough to use Doublefrost. So, here goes:<br />
<br />
Stealth 40 (50+)<br />
CS 39 (45+)<br />
Axe 21 (30+)<br />
LA 34 (~40)<br />
Env 40 (50)<br />
<br />
With this spec I would still open with a 2h Axe and do my Crit chain. Then I would switch to my 2 axes, apply more poison and finish off using Double frost instead of going back to the 2h.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think of the 2 specs that I proposed. They both seem like they will be pretty effective, just don't know which will be best. I really appreciate all input you may have.<br />

But anyway, the template looks alright.</div></div><hr />
