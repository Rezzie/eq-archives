<br />
Name: Ingenuity <br />
Level Requirement: 61 <br />
Ability Type: Passive  <br />
Max Training: 3 Levels <br />
Description: This ability grants a melee user the ability to land a critical spell which is activated from a weapon proc or right-click item.<br />
The cost is as follows: <br />
<br />
Rank 1 (Level 61) - 1 Points <br />
Rank 2 (Level 63) - 3 Points <br />
Rank 3 (Level 65) - 5 Points  <br />
<br />
<br />
I have it as warrior (because it was only 1 AA point) and it never did anything (wielding my warrior epics all the times with 100dmg proc). Or is it only 1%? heehee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_tass the great</div><div class="date">12-13-02, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the warrior epic is a two part spell.  one does the damage and the other adds the hate.  because of this, they can't crit.  fo some reason the devs didn't code it so that you can crit the dd and not the hate, or even better, crit both.  there was a thread on steelwarrior about this, check there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ThinmanStrikes69Times</div><div class="date">12-23-02, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They also changed it (I swear) so that it doesnt work until level 63 (or possibly 62). I wouldnt have wasted the one point in at being level 61 as I did otherwise. I petitioned to try to get that point back, but never heard from a gm (big suprise there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Morbas</div><div class="date">12-27-02, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I was pretty pissed after proc'ing 40+ times with lvl 1 trained and had no crit blast when using my epics.  Hope this is fixed soon as is a very useless skill unless your using fleshgringer/skybreaker etc for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Varaho1</div><div class="date">12-29-02, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The warrior epic proc is a debuff. That is why it cannot crit blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Morbas</div><div class="date">12-30-02, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't mean it can't be coded around, of course VI is rather damn lazzy.</div></div><hr />

Seems that Ingenuity will not work with the Tranquil Staff proc much in the same way as you warriors seem to be getting shafted with the Epic proc. I understand the reason it doesn't work but the wording of the skill doesn't suggest that it will only work with single dd procs. Come to think of it the skill even works with some dual effect procs but not others. For example it works with the Baton of Royal Stature which is both DD and stun. &amp;lt;shrug&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Drenesh</div><div class="date">01-07-03, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here. I use a SoD, and it crits, and it is a 2 part spell (stun+dd). I have also noticed that frostbringer does not crit because it's a debuff.
