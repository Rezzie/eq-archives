<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaielen</div><div class="date">09-04-03, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This rant is about a co-worker.  We'll call this co-worker Paul.  If he finds out...GOOD!  Because you are a STONE AGED @#%$ RETARD!  <br />
<br />
I'm sitting at my desk, minding my own business and doing my work.  He's over talking to a buddy of his in an adjacent cubicle, when my cell phone goes off.  Mind you, my cell phone is on VIBRATE ONLY, so all it does is start skittering across the desk making a minimal noise.  I happen to get a kick out of the phone when it does this, so I watch and snicker at the phone as it's getting jiggy with it like it's straight macking on my coffee pot.  <br />
<br />
Well...this utter @#%$ retard looks over and makes this, &quot;my God, how pathetic&quot; look and starts COMPLAINING and telling me how I DON'T NEED A CELL PHONE!<br />
<br />
I am a patient person...I listen attentively, and then pleasantly tell him that only an idiot would fail to see the endless number of uses that cell phones have.  So THEN he starts asking if I'm into computers and computer games and such, and I decide to humor this neanderthal.  I answer that, yes, of course I'm into computers and technology.  THEN, this shmuck goes off on a tirade about how I can absolutely NOT be into sports then, because I'm a tech junky and a nerd.<br />
<br />
Alright, you stupid @#%$, allow me to enlighten you in something...<br />
<br />
I've been training in (and am still training every day in) more martial arts than you can pronounce since I was FIVE YEARS OLD.  I could take this cell phone that you are ripping on and shove it so far down your throat that when you farted it WOULD SOUND LIKE THE NOKIA THEME!<br />
<br />
All of this is coming from the jack-ass that fishes with MILK JUGS!  That's right, ONLY milk jugs.  I can see jugging for overnight and fishing during the day...<br />
<br />
NOPE!  Only jugs!  He drinks and stays in his CAMPER the rest of the time!  You stupid @#%$!  A camper is NOT camping, no matter what your father told you while he was banging your sister.  Also, GET A ROD AND REEL!  Bait a hook more than once a day you PANSY!  <br />
<br />
Paul also INSISTS that any man that hangs out with only women is GAY!  There is a man here at my job that walks for health and fun with about four women.  These women are gorgeous, by the way, but because this guy hangs out with only these women, he's GAY!  <br />
<br />
Ahem...NO HE'S NOT!  You stupid knuckle dragging homophobe!  Just because he's better looking, more successful, and flushes more brain cells down the toilet when recovering from a previous day's hearty lunch than you have ever been able to CREATE, does not mean that you have to find something to make you feel better about having an undersized package.  The guy that gets all the women?  HE WEARS A @#%$ CELL PHONE ON HIS HIP, @#%$!<br />
<br />
CHIST, I am so glad that I have some ability to control my temper or I would go postal and just start offing all of the people that should have just passed up life and went straight into the afterlife.  I suggest everyone write a letter to God and include a list of some mistakes that he must have obviously made when he handed out souls.  My list looks something like this already (leaving out the obvious ones like Osama and Saddam)...<br />
<br />
Smelly bitch from work<br />
Brainchildren behind telemarketing<br />
People who started reality television<br />
Anti-technology guy Paul from work<br />
<br />
I know this rant doesn't have much of a point...but I feel better now.  I'm going to go make a phone call on my cell now.  :&quot;&gt;  <br />
<br />
Edit:  Made things flow a bit better...my pissed off tirades are more stream of conciousness than actual stories.  Edited by: Kaielen at: 9/4/03 3:58 am</div></div><hr />

Sounds like 'Paul' is a rather insecure fella.  But then, aren't most folks that make insults and generalizations like that?    Oh...  wait a sec...     <br />

Yep. Sounds like you have a real winner there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrocat Moonstalker</div><div class="date">09-04-03, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cao was imitating a buff guy by saying real men wrestle. Someone appeared to have mistook that as not imitating but flat out saying it, and made fun of cao. Hence your comment.<br />
<br />
Elerion was pointing out that Gnimish hadn't mistook it and was referring (I think) to the original post, or else was going along with cao's sarcastic imitation, which is what Nenjin and Boddi(?) were doing.<br />
<br />
Cao's post after Gnimish's confused me, but I think he was saying that he (cao) was actually a nerd and dropping the imitation because was replying to Nenjin's joking comment that he was homosexual.<br />
<br />
Elerion's last comment was suggesting to add a few linebreaks before Cao.<br />
<br />
Only nerds practice martial arts, it's a scientific fact. Real men wrestle... *snicker*<br />
<br />
Cao <br />
<br />
because someone (I'm too burnt out now to think about who) mistook Cao's post. Someone thought that Cao was saying Real men wrestle, like Cao. &quot;Real men wrestle.. *snicker* cao.&quot; the last line &quot;Cao&quot; is actually his sig I think. So... confusion there can be forgiven.<br />
<br />
Of course, I could be mistaken. <br />
<br />
EDIT: And of course, Nenjin beats me to it and explains it much simpler. Pyrocat Moonstalker<br />

<br />
Second, my &quot;add a few linebreaks&quot; comment had the error that it said &quot;/snicker Nenjin&quot; instead of &quot;/chuckle Nenjin&quot;. It was meant to clarify the pause between Cao's &quot;/chuckle Nenjin&quot; and his wailing on the original post's neanderthal.<br />

<br />
I am a patient person...I listen attentively, and then pleasantly tell him that only an idiot would fail to see the endless number of uses that cell phones have. <br />
<br />
The guy never said cell phones weren't useful.  Im sure he would agree that they can be useful, his point was that you don't need one, which you don't.    Cell phones are super useful, but that doesn't make them any less annoying to other people around a cell phone user. <br />
<br />
Also, im going to have to disagree here.  If a guy only hangs out with women, typically(not always) he is not after them romantically, the two most likely reason he is able to hang around 4 gorgeous women are A  he's gay, B  the women think he's gay.  Or perhaps, he has a girlfriend and the gorgeous women dont feel threatened by him.   Hanging out with women doesn't qualify as &quot;getting&quot; them.   Lastly, people who wear cellphones on their hips when they are wearing shorts are dorks.  It's one dork step over wearing a waist pouch.  In fact, to avoid looking dorky, even in non-shorts attire, one should conceal the cell phone, or wear a suit powerful enough to overpower how goofy the phone looks.</div></div><hr />
