In that time 3rd Ed. has come out and it seems pretty neat in some ways, but since i have not made any in gaming aquaintences here i don't really have any real need for the books.<br />
<br />
The problem is i am a gamer through and through and i want to know the details of the new stuff far beyond what the new 3rd ed. based games give you.  I have a desire to buy the dang books, but i feel like its a waste of money really.  Maybe i am just being silly. Brelkor the Blackhammer The Masta Back Stabba, retired rogue<br />

My old group broke up (some married, some had kids, some moved) and I haven't put the effort out to find a new one, really.<br />
<br />
Finding a roleplaying group that fits can be a tall order.  So many ...hmm... ideosyncratic, shall we say, individuals are in the community.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather not be with. the couple groups I know that aren't spend half their time drinking and @#%$ when they are gaming, another thing which I tend to avoid. <br />
<br />
even though my own group of friends doesn't game anymore just because everyone has varying schedules and only one gets weekends off, I still occasionally buy gaming books just to read.</div></div><hr />
