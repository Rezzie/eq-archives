I have like 11 Goblin Helms, 10 Goblin Mask, and 4 Goblin Mail. Not happy. Taking up a lot of wasted space. Anything that I can do with these items???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-18-03, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Goblin items are a bunch of smithing materials rolled into one item. They sellin in the auction house for decent coin. You can however, combine the goblin items with a crystal to break it down into it's component parts(lightning I think) if you want to use it for smithing yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brelkor</div><div class="date">11-18-03, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, almost anything you find you can sell in the auction house.  Its always a good idea to check whatever you find cause it could be work $$$.<br />

<br />
I thought that the synth process required quite a bit of skill in blacksmithing or goldsmithing, maybe I'm wrong? But I'd rather the cash than more stuff to take up space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ANTI REIGN</div><div class="date">11-18-03, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I put that stuff in the auction house. Maxed my limit. Within 2 hours sold it all. Refilled the auction house and less than 5 hours total time: 6,250 gil. Woot. I am now going to try and break the stuff down. Possible to make more money on the individual items? I don't know. I will post later on what I find. But the auction is the fo shizzle. Thanks guys for the input. Helped me a ton!</div></div><hr />

It might be the most innovative thing I have ever seen in a mmog and I hope Wow and any other new games coming to market are paying attention!</div></div><hr />
