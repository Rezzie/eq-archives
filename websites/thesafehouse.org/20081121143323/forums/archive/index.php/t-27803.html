<br />
we are still looking for some more dedicated players to join our ranks.<br />
Please find attached some information about our guild and if you like what you read, we'd be happy to see you on our boards :)<br />
<br />
Information about United Kingdoms<br />
<br />
United Kingdoms is a long established European guild that was formed around the time the Antonious Bayle server was launched in EverQuest 1. Since then the guild has grown and prospered, opening new branches in EverQuest 2 (Splitpaw Server) and World of Warcraft (EU Terenas Server).<br />
<br />
The guild was established to promote playing in a warm and friendly environment that allows players to progress at their own speed. All United Kingdoms players are skilled at their respective classes and are expected to behave in a mature and respectful manner both in game and on Vanguard related forums.<br />
<br />
While we are not a raiding guild, the guild has progressed well in the other three branches of United Kingdoms. For example the EQ1 branch is one fight away from Demi-Plane access and the WoW branch is currently progressing through Karazhan. We hope to continue this success in the Vanguard branch of United Kingdoms.<br />
<br />
Based on how things worked out in the other branches of United Kingdoms I would imagine that the guild will have three raids per week once we reach the required raiding levels.<br />
<br />
We are a European Guild that plays on the EU Gelenia server.<br />
<br />
