This means you haven't finished with the Libraian.  Go speak with him, Hail (important), then &quot;new lore&quot;  That should be enough to get your Sol Ro Tower flag resolved.  If not, unlock/guided a few times, with trips to library.  You have all the right flags for it.<br />
<br />
Then you just need RZ for Elementals and SolRo for Fire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I goto the Seer and unlock memories, i get:<br />
<br />
'Your heart beat speeds as you recall the Warlord's flaming axe, behind the dark sockets of his helm you sense darker intentions'<br />
<br />
ok, so i goto the librarian, do the the bit about what lore, i have information, bleh bleh bleh.... go back to seer<br />
<br />
guided meditation yields me:<br />

Mithaniel has been bested. An aura surrounds the mystical symbols that have appeared on your arm.<br />

<br />
Ok, my question now is this, I can zone into Tactics and I have NOT done the PoS quest (atleast not that I can remember.. may have been too many beers)... WHY?  And why won't my RZTW flag show up... and what friggin else do I need to do??<br />
<br />
I SPENT HOURS LAST NIGHT TRYING TO FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT!!<br />
<br />
And if you tell me to go back and forth from librarian to seer, please explain the exact process and hails if you could.<br />
<br />
This is soooo aggrivating.<br />

<br />
Marr and Agnar done<br />
<br />
Quote:Tylis is being tortured by Saryrn. The only way for him to get away from his misery is to escape from the Plane of Torment.<br />
<br />
Terris and Bert both complete and you are preflagged for KoS. No Saryn.<br />

<br />
Have MB both zeks.<br />
<br />
Results:<br />
Need KoS and Saryn, that completes your cypher.<br />
With cypher, you understand zek notes, opens sol ro tower.<br />
With cypher, your rallos will resolve opening water, air, earth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Daalin Deathmidget</div><div class="date">04-15-04, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks Jav.<br />
<br />
I was pretty sure I had done MB.  And I was pretty sure that all I needed to do was KoS and Saryrn.<br />
<br />
Is there a need to go back and keep doing dialogue with librarian and seer?  It won't unlock anything else will it?<br />
<br />
p.s., did I mention how much a pain in the ass finding a Saryrn raid is?  That raid is such a freakin time-sink<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Javan Transient</div><div class="date">04-15-04, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After Saryn you need to do the 'new lore' thing to resolve the cypher and gain access to sol ro tower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Daalin Deathmidget</div><div class="date">04-16-04, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so there was this open raid last night and I got my toon KoS and Saryrn.<br />
<br />
My question is this, How can I tell if I have SolRo access?<br />
<br />
After I went back and forth twice from Librarian and Seer, I then went to the stories guy and I only got 1 aa.  Does that mean that I haven't unlocked SolRo?  I now have these in my seer notes:<br />
<br />

<br />
- Flagged for elementals, but have not been flagged for fire (need Sol Ro and 5 minis)<br />
<br />
<br />
Since you can reach Air, Water, and Earth you can reach Sol Ro tower as well I'd wager.  Next step:<br />
<br />
1) Locate Miak (red drake outside pof), get your preflag<br />
2) kill 5 mini's in sol ro tower to gain access to his chamber (or get raided in)<br />
3) kill sol ro<br />
4) librarian/seer dance to gain PoF access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xabrian</div><div class="date">04-18-04, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You say, 'unlock memories'<br />
Besting the Burning Prince proves your might, but you still must prove your warrior's spirit.<br />
Your heart beat speeds as you recall the Warlord's flaming axe, behind the dark sockets of his helm you sense darker intentions.<br />
You recall meeting with Karana, but the memory is clouded.  You sense that the answer you seek may be in Storms.<br />
You attempt to recall your defeat of Saryrn, but whenever you try to focus you feel a searing pain on your arm.<br />
Although it was kind of you to help him, Tylis still seems to have no idea who you are.<br />
As you recall your memory of your battle against the Plaguebringer, an image of the Fuirstel brothers flashes through your mind.<br />
<br />
You say, 'guided meditation'<br />
Your soul has formed a bond with the Plane of Time.  You can now pass through the portal in the Plane of Tranquility safely.<br />
The information obtained from Mithaniel is written in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
Mithaniel has been bested.  An aura surrounds the mystical symbols that have appeared on your arm.<br />
You have completed all of Honor's Trials.<br />
You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.<br />
Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal.  The information provided to you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />
Grummus has been destroyed, about his corpse you found a small ward to protect from disease.<br />
Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.<br />
The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now this is what I get when I talk to the Seer. That I still need BoT Key is obvious. However I have all other flags and something is wrong. The following is what I think:<br />
<br />
Grummus has been destroyed, about his corpse you found a small ward to protect from disease.<br />
This means Grummus dead but no hailing of the Brothers.<br />
<br />
Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.<br />
This means Grummus dead and I HAVE hailed the Brothers.<br />
<br />
It appears as tho I am bugged. Showing Both Yes and No to the Grummus flag. I'm hoping this is the case, and a /petition will fix it. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Javan Transient</div><div class="date">04-18-04, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what you are seeing is what happens when you haven't really &quot;finished&quot;.  You get both on Grummus' death, the first meaning you need to finish the hails in sickbay and stuff, the second meaning you can get into CoD.<br />
<br />
Go chat with the folks in sickbay, and the guy right outside disease, and then unlock/guided and see if that resolves the first one.  <br />
<br />
If so you then unlock/guided to resolve bert, get kos preflag, guided to resolve, guided to resolve saryn, librarian for Cypher.<br />
<br />
Then BoT key, resolve agnar, librarian for info on zeb, opens sol ro tower.<br />
<br />
Get miak preflag for fire in PoT, resolve rallos, resolve sol ro, and you are set.</div></div><hr />

   I just wanted to extend a personal thanks to you for all your help with people decrypting their seer flag data.  Because I'm in guam and haven't been able to play much due to a rediculously slow connection, I haven't been able to support this thread as much as I wanted to originally.<br />
<br />
Granted, most of the work was done with the first posting, you keep it alive and make it a much more valuable tool.<br />
<br />
If you see any changes that need to be made, please email me (I'll send you a private message with my direct email address) and I'll try to update the flag listing asap.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for helping out the EQ community.  You rock.<br />

<br />
So, kill Keeper, return to seer unlock/guided should get you &quot;Tylis has been removed from his agony.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then unlock/guided again to resolve Saryn kill. should get &quot;Saryrn has been bested. An aura surrounds the mystical symbols that have appeared on your arm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Go to the librarian, Hail.  That should complete the cypher.  Then tell the librarian 'new lore', that should get you &quot;The words of Maelin echo in your mind, 'The Zeks and Solusek are planning an invasion in Norrath, find out more from Rallos if you can.&quot;  And open of Tower of Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
Then back to seer for unlock/guided to resolve the Rallos kill, back to Libraian with &quot;new lore&quot;.  That should combine the agnar and rz kills to open the elementals.<br />
<br />
You lack 3 of the sol ro mini's, so you won't be able to zone to sol ro's chambers, but you should be able to enter PoFire anway.<br />
<br />
edit: some &quot;new lore&quot; are &quot;new information&quot; or &quot;what lore&quot;.  As I personally haven't been there, I can't swear either way. Edited by: Javan Transient at: 4/20/04 8:38 am</div></div><hr />

Finished all 3 trials<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
According to first page, I should be done with Agnarr branch but I'm getting the &quot;not done with BoT&quot; message...<br />
<br />
What I know I need:<br />
- VZ<br />
- KOS/Saryn<br />
- LMM<br />
<br />
That should give me Solro/poe/pow/poa...<br />
<br />
What I am unsure of is preflag mobs...<br />
<br />
I appreciate the help !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second, you need to wrap up your TT and Bert stuff.  Go to sickbay in Tranquility and speak with Poxbourne (finish TT) and Alder &amp;amp; Elder (finish Bert).  Once they are done you can get your Torment preflag by saying 'I will go' to Shadyglade.<br />
<br />
Third, after you get Torment preflag take out the Keeper and Saryn.<br />
<br />
Fourth, Once torment done, take care of Mith Marr and VZ and you good to go for Sol Ro Tower (after chatting with librarian) <br />
<br />
Fifth, after sol ro access granted, chat with librarian some more and elementals (minus fire) will open.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, you right on track.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last night participated in an AD pickup raid. I'm level 62. We killed AD. I hailed the Planar Projection. We all dropped down into the water and ran down the tunnel/canyon and clicked on the lighting thinking we would go to HoH. I went to PoT. Saw message that I haven't completed the PoJ trial. This is true. My question is since I have temp flag for killing AD, once I complete PoJ trial, do I have to click on the zone in into HoH that is in AD's lair in PoV, or can I access it thru PoT?? If I have to enter HoH via the PoV zoneline, can I just run thru when AD isn't up? If i have key to lever to AD's lair can I just haul arse to click on the zoneline???<br />
<br />
Another question. I have gotten all the pieces to the BoT flag and did the final combine of the ecsoteric somethingorother. Gave this to the guy in PoS at zone out. Once I get PoJ trial done, do I just zone into BoT through PoT or do I need to enter via the zoneline in PoS at the big storm???<br />
<br />
Thanks for a very well done thread. I will reference this a lot in my planar progression adventures.<br />

<br />
For BoT I think you still need to zone via PoS</div></div><hr />

I got Vallon, had TZ and RZ, plus TT, KoS/Saryn, MM, Agnarr. As far as I can tell all I need is Bertoxx. But look at the Seer's comments.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:41 2004] You say, 'unlock my memories'<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:42 2004] Your heart beat speeds as you recall the Warlord's flaming axe, behind the dark sockets of his helm you sense darker intentions.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:42 2004] You attempt to recall your defeat of Saryrn, but whenever you try to focus you feel a searing pain on your arm.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:42 2004] Although it was kind of you to help him, Tylis still seems to have no idea who you are.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] You say, 'guided meditation'<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] The History translated for you reveals the fate of Zebuxoruk.  Trapped in the Plane of Time you must gain the power of the elements to gain entrance.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] Mithaniel has been bested.  An aura surrounds the mystical symbols that have appeared on your arm.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] You have completed all of Honor's Trials.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal.  The information provided to you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] Milyk has been saved from certain death, but is not recovering.  Only by destroying the ruler of all things pestilent will his curse be lifted.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
[Sat May 01 23:48:44 2004] You remember Nitram's words - 'three small turns to the right on the bottommost rivet should open the door'.<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Why am I getting the flaming axe line but the notes aren't being translated? I've been up to the library to see the runt but he keeps saying come back when I have more information. What's up?<br />
<br />
Also, I had a link to an incredibly comprehensive site on PoP flagging and the messages. Anyone know the site? It was someone's personal site on a rr.com address, IIRC. Edited by: Traxan Hahnemann at: 5/1/04 11:15 pm</div></div><hr />

Marr + Agnar complete<br />
<br />
Quote:Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />
Have Terris<br />
<br />
Quote:Milyk has been saved from certain death, but is not recovering. Only by destroying the ruler of all things pestilent will his curse be lifted.<br />
Need Bert(as you said)<br />
<br />
Well, get Bert, get KoS preflag, resolve KOS kill, resolve Saryn, that will allow you to get the cypher (Saryn + Marr)<br />
<br />
Once you have the Cypher, you can translate the stuff from TZ and VZ (zeks are planning invasion, opens up sol ro).<br />
<br />
The RZ text just means &quot;he's dead, but you aren't elemental yet&quot;.  Once you open sol ro, your RZ + Agnar will resolve and you'll be elemental flagged (except fire, you'll need Sol Ro himself for that).</div></div><hr />

I know that I am missing a few, but I decided to skip them, such as the HOH trial, where I could just visa in HoHB and kill MM, that's what I did, and hailed the PP after MM is dead.<br />

As for the part that isn't listed on the topic, is the Mithaniel part, as:<br />

AFAIK, the only flagging part that you could have actually skipped was AD.  You need to kill Bert and the other two HoHa trials.<br />
