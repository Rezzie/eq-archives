<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">07-21-02, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally bought the game and started playing it this weekend.  After several aborted character attempts, I'm going to try to play some of chapter 1 online with a friend.  I noticed that if you start in Chapter 1 with a new character, they start at level 1 instead of level 3 as they might be in the chapter.  <br />
<br />
People have mentioned that if a character saved on a server were lost they'd just recreate it, my question is how?  The toolset didn't seem to have anything for editing a character, and there isn't a download for a character editor.  How would you edit a character?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">07-21-02, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make the character, join a server, and have a GM buff you up to the level I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hummerlein</div><div class="date">07-21-02, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">or make an npc that gives an exp reward just for talking to it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">07-21-02, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't there a way to get the console up in the game and just add exp that way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tubbins</div><div class="date">07-21-02, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, hit ~ (right next to 1) then type DebugMode 1 (case sensitive) then:<br />
<br />
Cheats: (case sensitive)(X is a number) <br />
SetCHA X - Sets your Charisma <br />
SetSTR X - Sets your Strength <br />
SetINT X - Sets your Intelligence <br />
SetWIS X - Sets your Wisdom <br />
SetCON X - Sets your Constitution <br />
dm_givegold X - Gives the X amount of gold to you <br />
GetLevel X - Raises you an additional X amount of levels <br />
dm_god - Makes you invulneralble (does not require you to click on the player character) <br />
<br />
On some of the cheats, it will simply give you a message saying &quot;success&quot; after you enter the code and press ENTER. Other ones, such as the SetCHA will say &quot;Entered Target Mode&quot;. You must click on your character to enable the changes on your character. <br />
<br />
Check out the in-game listing, since it contains a whole bunch of different functions. <br />

be careful not to go over 20, it will revert you to one.  i think if you say give 17 levels it will take you all the way to 20.<br />
<br />
alternative cheats: <br />
To use a command line action, you can bring up the console using the tilde key. You can also enter console commands into the chat widow by prefacing them with a double pound “##”. <br />

nwnplayer.ini modification <br />
If you modify any value using the console your character becomes &quot;invalid&quot; for the next chapter. To fix this, change the following setting in your nwnplayer.ini <br />
<br />
&quot;Single Player Enforce Legal Characters=1&quot; to <br />
&quot;Single Player Enforce Legal Characters=0&quot; <br />

<br />
or, i'm sure you could rip apart the code that shifts your alignment when you talk to certain npc's and make one in your own module.  i need to do that sometime and figure out how to change from lawful to chaotic.<br />
<br />
that's one of the main things i thought was lacking from the game, the ability to become more or less lawful/chaotic.</div></div><hr />
