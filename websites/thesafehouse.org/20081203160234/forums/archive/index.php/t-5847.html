<br />
Anyhow, here's how it works. You're selling some stuff in few bags. The person comes up, asks to see the bags. Ok, you show em. They then cancel, and say ok, I want A, B, C, X, Y, and Z (if they're smart, as this person was, they ask for the least valuable items). You stick em in the window. Then they ask to see the other bag (usually the one with the most valuable stuff in it) again to check something. So you put that in the window. Then they push cancel. Ooops! You've just been scammed   EQ drops items into open inventory spaces first - this of course means that the bag(s) will drop, and they'll be spamming click to grab em.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Felinity Venomblade</div><div class="date">08-03-01, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a similar experience when buying HM backpacks. This person sold me 2 HMs and asked me to &quot;hold&quot; some items for him since he didn't have the space anymore. So he filled the first trade slots with junk and then 2 backpacks. At that time I wasnt aware of any potential problems, I had 2 open inventory slots open for the bags. Of course my slots got filled with junk and the bags dropped. I didn't realize this until he told me &quot;Hey, you dropped one, here it is&quot; and actually handed over one bag ... I never saw the second one. Only after a few minutes I realized what happened. I started talking to him and he denied my accusations that he scammed me. <br />
<br />
Of course if he had just left the junk in the bags, and asked for them after the trade, this wouldn't have happened. So either we both made the same mistake or it was a nasty scam.<br />
<br />
So I petitioned and a guide asked me to tell the story. He couldn't help, he told me they can't trace items once dropped. And there was no proof that this was done deliberately or by accident.<br />

<br />
Oh and if I don't have room for the items to go back in my backpack I just don't show them and just repeat stats to them......and even if I do have room they can just ask stats and I will tell them, especially if I am not in the mood to pop a trade window up so someone can oogle at my equipment.

<br />
Just as easy to type out the stats. If it's someone I don't know, then I just don't put an item in a trade window. <br />
<br />
It's just not necessary, imho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tindari</div><div class="date">08-14-01, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the more nefarious ones I encountered was when a person would ask to see the traded items in a trade window. He would stand on top of the logs that are burning near the shady swashbuckler. <br />
<br />
If you don't already know this, as I did not, since he is significantly higher in elevation than you are on the Z axis you will actually hand the items to the log not him. Your items fall to the ground and he picks them up and then camps or /q's.<br />
<br />
Fortunately I had confirm item drop on so after two failed attempts to hand him the item he agreed to buy from me I realized what was going on and quickly hopped up onto the log with him. He changed his mind about buying the items immediately.<br />
<br />
nice try man... hope no one actually loses from this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sylvya Sylvernote</div><div class="date">08-15-01, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things to remember, from the reimbursement policy on the EQ website:<br />
<br />
  7. Dropped Items<br />
   7.1. Items dropped, intentionally or accidentally, will not be reimbursed.<br />
   7.2. Items that fall to the ground during trades due to a full inventory, or due to those items not fitting into a container will not be reimbursed.<br />
   7.3. Any items that are thrown as a projectile, such as items placed in your range slot, intentionally or accidentally, will not be reimbursed.<br />
      7.3.1 Note: To avoid accidentally dropping an item, we suggest you set the item dropping option to never.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
14. Trades<br />
   14.1. Items traded to or sold to other players, pets or other NPC's, intentionally or accidentally, will not be reimbursed.<br />
      14.1.1. Note: GM's will not assist with any trade disputes. All trades are considered final.<br />
<br />
The one time I had a problem with a trade was when a very close friend of mine was transferring items to another character. She had one main inventory slot open, and a bunch of bags that hold &quot;large&quot; items. Well, I handed her four things, none of which were larger than medium, and when she came to give my alt the stuff... She could only find one -- the one that went into the main inventory slot. <br />
<br />
So, I petitioned (several times because my petitions kept getting misplaced, or lost when they were escalated or something), and about 12 hours later I spoke to a GM about it, who said he wouldn't or couldn't do anything and told me to read the item reimbusement policy. At this point, I didn't even care whether I got the stuff back or not; I just wanted him to tell me where it went. He conjectured that the items fell to the ground, but I knew that wasn't the case. He refused to track the items. *shrugs*<br />
<br />
Two weeks later, she logs on and notices a Bear Skin Potion Bag (or something of that sort) filling her last inventory slot. It contained the three items we had lost.<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
 Oh, and pertaining to section 7 up there... I was stupid enough to drop my Chetari Bonecrafted Shield , conveniently forgetting the bug that causes items with the ribcage graphic to be untouchable when on the ground. Well, a very, very nice guide restored the shield to me, I suppose because of the glitch. The next day, though, the MotD on Fennin was a reminder that items lost due to dropping would not be reimbursed. lol    Edited by: Sylvya Sylvernote at: 8/15/01 6:05:49 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
My gripes are <br />
<br />
a) it's a flaw in the trade interface - the items will go back into your inv before the bags, depending on the order they're put in the window, and this person deliberately exploited this (against multiple people, over the course of a week or two)<br />
<br />
b) it took TWO WEEKS to get a response from the GM<br />
<br />
Oh, and to top that cake off, a few days later, a bag vanished on a cancelled trade, just poofed, didn't drop.<br />
<br />
(can I include c), the same time the head gm responded, my friend died to aggroed druids in NK when he sat down - with amiable faction, not aggroed by wild animals, etcetc, and the head GM told him too bad :P)<br />
<br />
Die and learn, lose items and learn, so it goes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tindari</div><div class="date">08-22-01, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As is usual in safehouse threads I respond to, I have something rather off topic about inventory losses but not trade scams.<br />
<br />
I was fighting solo in SolB with my warrior. He has a Royal Frosted Velium Crown (no drop item) and also a Crown of King Tranix (not no drop). I ran into the Kobold Noble which is an annoying chanter mob with a penchant for Beguiling folks, so I grabbed my Crown of King Tranix out of the bag I had and placed it on my head (for the added MR), just in time to get charmed. Obviously the RFV Helm was still in my &quot;hand&quot; as I had not placed it safely into my inventory. When Beguile wore off, and I regained control of my character the RFV crown was gone, not in my inventory and not on my head. I am actually very glad it was the No Drop item and not the Tranix crown since when I petitioned they could not dismiss this as a &quot;dropped item.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sadly Brioma (my server GM) was not on yesterday and will not be back until Thursday, and there was a patch today. I only hope this gets resolved. Be carefull of charm and items in your &quot;hand,&quot; for that matter be wary of fear as well, as this also causes the same Linkdead effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Scammer offers to sell Mino Axe for 4pp (yes, this was THAT long ago)<br />
<br />
2. Scammer puts Mino Axe in trade window<br />
<br />
3. Victim inspects Mino Axe, and puts 4pp in trade window.<br />
<br />
4. Scammer swaps Mino Axe for Rusty Axe.  They have the same icon, so Victim does not notice this.<br />
<br />
5. Both agree, Scammer pockets 4pp and logs off/repeats<br />
<br />
<br />
Thankfully, they did change the way the trade interface works so you can't do this anymore, but I think it's pretty clear that what BacksTabber01 is talking about is a bad variation of this.</div></div><hr />
