<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_MaillolthesexyRogue</div><div class="date">06-02-02, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aight, I'm sure this has been asked before... and most people use Thrust for their assassin class.  But, I'm reading more and more about people kicking some major ass using slash.<br />
<br />
I just about to start playing DAoC again, and this is what I'm thinking for stats and point distrubution.  BTW, I used to have a lvl 12 or so Infil, and I was going CS/Stealth/Env.. and I sucked ass.  I had a good hit, then I couldn't fight at all.<br />
<br />
Ok, I want to be an Brit Infil - +10 str, +10 con, +10 qui to start.<br />
<br />
Lvl 50 skill level - I know I'll never get to lvl 50, but hey.  Oh, and btw, I don't know any items that gain skill cause I havn't really played the game much at all.  From what I hear though, you can't use items to get you better styles, only poisons.  Anyways... here it is.<br />
<br />
Stealth - 40<br />
Slashing/Thrust - 50  (I don't know which one I should take)<br />
Evenom - 27<br />
CS - 39<br />
DW - 29<br />
<br />
As to the Slash/Thurst thing.  I know slash is more based on STR, and Thrust is STR/DEX.  The only thing I'm curious about is the styles.  I've read all the descriptions of them, but because I havn't used them.. I don't really know how they work.  Some require an evade, others a parry.. weird things like that.<br />
<br />
I just want my character to be able to stick up for himself and fight a bit after I do my initial CS.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

I can solo a yellow, no problems... with at least 1/3 hp and end left.<br />
<br />
We'll see how he does at higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">06-04-02, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like slash is better at lowe-mid levels and thrust better at 50.  I'd think slash isn't so good for R v R since few armors are vulnerable to it, and most are resistant.  You can always switch over if the respec ever makes it, after you're a higher level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">06-04-02, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on what you plan on doing with your character.  Ultimately I think thrust is more powerful once you reach 50 if you spec all the way to 50 for dragonfang.  I believe this gives you the most powerful character possible.  however, thrust styles are very weak, and you will be sacrificing a lot of damage to gain the benefit of dragonfang and a greater variety of targets which are vulnerable to your weapon.<br />
<br />
Slash is nice for battling other assassins and archers, and has slower weapons available to increase your PA damage cap.  The styles in the slash line are also better than the thrust styles.  Primarily amelthyst slash which is the most damaging no-opening attack available to an infiltrator and gives a bonus to chance to hit.<br />
<br />
Overall I think thrust is the better way to go because of dragonfang being the ultimate weapon in an infiltrators arsenal.  But before level 50 or with a lower thrust spec I think slash is probably more effective.</div></div><hr />

This is what I've been waiting for...<br />
<br />
The only reason I'm playing DAoC is because I'm bored of sitting around for my Shadowbane beta account.  So, I figure I can pass the time with this.  I know I won't hit lvl 50.. I know that for sure.  I play EQ for 2 years and only hit lvl 33.. I'm not a hardcore player.. I just have fun while I play.<br />
<br />
So, if slashing will give me what I need for the time I will be playing.. then that's exactly what I want...<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />
