Is there any reason to start a new rogue in WoW when it releases, other than to be in a different world than I was before?</div></div><hr />

<br />
do good enough damage that you can solo fairly effectively<br />
<br />
also pull fairly well, so good for groups<br />

Watch for my new rogue review in a few weeks. I'm taking my time evaluating the new rogue before I write it. I think alot of the initial posts you might have seen stem from the immediate reaction of players to not being as powerful as we were last push also alot of players in this present push may have joined thinking that rogues were the end all and be all and are disappointed.<br />
<br />
But, we're still in Beta afterall so we'll see what the rogue ends up being and how feedback will affect our role. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LeavandorEQ</div><div class="date">04-27-04, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in beta, and I'm playing a currently level 28 Troll rogue.<br />
<br />
I've noticed a lot of people complaining that that rogue class isn't group friendly anymore.  Since the popular term for the sap change is 'nerf' (why god is beta full of idiots), the class population has plummeted quite a bit.<br />
<br />
However, having played a rogue, I can say that it's the most fun class in WoW right now, at least for me.  Second would probably be a warrior, and I played a warrior in EQ.  Rogues are extremely fun to play as a *rogue*.  You can do some amazing stuff that most people demand that you absolutely positively need a group for, solo.  I've been flat out called a liar when I mention some of the quests I've done solo before.  That's how powerful the class is in a solo perspective.<br />
<br />
On the grouping front, I put out more damage than any other class besides mages.  It's pretty near your Rogue/Wizard comparison in EQ.  The rogue is the king of sustained damage, but the mage will beat a rogue in burst damage easily.<br />
<br />
We also have our poisons, which can add a lot.  First and foremost you have the snare poison, which will add a 30% chance/hit proc on your weapon for 30 minutes.  This can be invaluable since almost every mob that runs will do so at high speeds.  Then there's the mind-numbing poison which increases casting time by 70%, which again is very useful, considering that caster mobs in elite dungeons/encounters typically nuke for nearly a third of my total hitpoints.  Which is probably a fifth on a warrior, nothing to laugh at.<br />
<br />
We're good at pulling; a stealthed rogue can sneak near a camp of humanoid mobs, sap one and run back with any other adds, doing damage on their way back.  We have enough hitpoints to withstand this too, falling somewhere in between a warrior's and mage's hitpoints, leaning more toward a warrior's.<br />
<br />
I love the class and its just getting more fun as I get new abilities.  'Distract', even though it's a little bugged because of the skill required to use it isn't increasing properly, will be another invaluable pulling tool.  You get a little circle that sticks to the terrain on your cursor, and you click on the ground where you want.  You throw a distraction in that general area, and any mobs within the influence radius will go over and 'check it out', putting their backs to you and moving them around without agro'ing them.<br />
<br />
So yes, if you're interested in playing a rogue that's a little of the EQ version and little of the Solid Snake variety, then you should start a rogue. Edited by: LeavandorEQ at: 4/27/04 3:07 pm</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lomack</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play most days with some friends of mine.  In the group we have...<br />
<br />
Warrior, Priest, Paladin, Rogue, and either a 2nd paladin or a 2nd Rogue.<br />
<br />
Without the rogues there stuff dies dang slow.<br />
Chests don't get opened.<br />
We have no Croud Control at all.<br />
Priests can lower agro radius but not assist radius, I love distract.<br />
<br />
With the rogues there our warrior can run in Defensive stance, which lowers the damage he takes and lets him taunt better.  If we didn't have rogues with us to use snare poisons, the warrior would not be able to use the defensive stance (hamstring for warriors is only in battle stance, I think).  Meaning we would have to run all over killing stuff as it started to flee, probably picking up more adds in the process.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Maybe there are some rogues that think they are better solo, but I sure like having them in my groups.</div></div><hr />

Things got tough in Darkshore around lv 14, but then I ventured out and explored human and dwarf lands, completing quests all over the place, and now I'm 18 with Ambush, which rocks.<br />
<br />
Sap is a GREAT skill. I love it! It makes things much easier solo. In groups, you can just hide and hit incomming adds before they reach your friends and throw a punch.  The only thing I'd like better is if you could sap a mob that is fighting, but it is more of a challenge to sap mobs before they get to your group. I am glad you can only sap one mob at a time, as I'd love to avoid the EQ model of lining up mobs to kill one at a time.<br />
<br />
We do great dmg as well.</div></div><hr />
