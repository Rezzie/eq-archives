Im just thinking back of when i did Testament of Vanear quest back in 99 for my druid. There might be pages in here to make into a book of poison recipies for all we know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rebu</div><div class="date">10-23-02, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if I'd try using the sketch book to combine stuff we'd normally combine in a Mortar and Pestle, I mean it's nice to know and all that they are DNCs but to get on the right track I think we are looking for something else.<br />
<br />
Here's why...  It's a book right?  Looks just like every other recipe book?  So most likely when combined this is our readable recipe book.  What goes in books?  (Rocks, small rocks...sorry had to do it~)  Pages right?  <br />
<br />
So I have a few ideas how this may work...<br />
<br />
1)  Pages.  Possibly some other quests that result in pages for this book.  <br />
<br />
2)  Try more Caster type stuff.  Those blank pages and pens and stuff they sell.  (Possibly even try combining 1 Rune, 1Mage word, 1 Nec Word, 1 ench page...  if that doesn't work I doubt they'd get much more specific than that with research components).<br />
<br />
3) 4 slots...  4 first tier hunting planes right?  PoI, PoJ, PoN, Pod?  Possibly 1 thing from each of them, but I think this is reaching a little as they don't even hint at that.<br />
<br />
My best guess though is we need to find some sort of pages to fill this book that will combine it into our recipe book. &amp;lt;center&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66715&quot;&amp;lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Pokn&amp;lt;BR&gt;&amp;lt;/font&gt;&amp;lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;/a&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Slott Matchyn</div><div class="date">10-27-02, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at the text from Ciren Darkbog, he says that various masters of the shadow have the sketches, and he even gave lorin a book to hold them in. Put 2 and 2 together, now we just need to find these various masters of the shadow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squink McPoke</div><div class="date">10-27-02, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried some conversation with Hanns in qeynos about &quot;sketches&quot;, &quot;black mortar&quot;, &quot;new poisons&quot;, &quot;advanced poisons&quot;, &quot;new recipes&quot;, and didn't get any sort of response.<br />
<br />
My initial guess was that by &quot;masters of shadow&quot; they meant rogue guildmasters.  I didn't get any response from Stanos either when talking to him along these same lines.<br />
<br />
But that doesn't mean that they don't have something to say.  Look how many of us tried everything we could think of at the poison vendor in PoK, and look at the phrase we ended up needing to say.  Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nandayar</div><div class="date">10-27-02, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am thinking that the sketches will drop from the Dark Assassins, and that guildmasters will have information on how to find them.  I also think that the sketches that will combine in the book will not be for poisons at alll, but for the plans to make the balck marble mortar and pestol.  Just a pure guess but I think it is a good guess hehehehe. <br />

Results on one sketch for the sketch book.<br />
<br />
Quote:Ciren Darkbog smiles. 'Quite eager for the information are't we Ammon? Well here you have it, combine an advanced vial, a celestial suspension, one of the resins, and a poison element. For the more durable poisons ye need to add a rare element in addition to the common element. He also mentioned some of the more exotic poisons would require sketchs that various masters of shadow would have. The Dark Assassin even gave Loran a book in which to place these sketchs. Overall a very nice stranger, I couldn't help but admire the mortar he had as well, black as night and smooth as marble. Too bad he wouldn't part with that recipe.'<br />
<br />
The last part hints at the Black Mortar being required for exotic poisons.  With the advanced poison (teir 2) being discovered, is there another (tier 3) out there or are we missing something.  Will have to go check Lucy for more spells.<br />

You say, 'What about the dark assassin?'<br />
Ysanna MacGibbon says, 'That poor lad! I saw him in the tundra being chased by that big bear of Tundra Jack. I never liked that bear of his since the day he ate my poor dog Thunderpaw. Anyways i say Iceberg chasing the assassin and grabbed my trusty ahlspiess and threw it, aiming right for his big head. Can you believe I missed?? I hit his side instead. Iceberg ripped my ahlspiess out and ripped it into pieces and then went whining of to Tundra Jack. Serves that bear right! He ate my dog!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What ahlspiess?'<br />
Ysanna MacGibbon says, 'Ahhhh my beloved shrieking ahlspiess, it was nice i was able to help a fellow assassin out but i really do miss it. The dark assassin gave me a sketch of paper he said was very valueable but it still pains me to be without my favourite throwing weapon. If you go get me another I would gladly part with this sketch.'<br />
<br />
turning in shrieking ahlspiess gets you a 'sluggish sketch'. <br />

gnome trainer Lobal Postugger:<br />
<br />
&quot;You have heard of him? I had a nice conversation wtih him, sharing some of the secrets of gnomish sprits if yah know what I mean! In return he gave me a sketch that seems quite interesting. Of course I am stuck in this place waiting youngsters to teach when I would rather be out with you making poisons. Perhaps you are willing to make a trade with me for the sketch?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said &quot;I am willing to make a trade&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic! If you combine Rage of Incapacitation, Wasted Flesh, and Dreams of Drusella all within a coffin bottle you can make me a nice bundle of poisons to play with. Then I will have no need of this sketch.&quot;<br />

You say, 'what about the dark assassin?'<br />
Pazin Punox says 'Aye we were visited by that dark assassin, he left some sketch in my safekeeping, I would gladly give you a copy if you would take care of a problem that has been vexing me.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I will take care of problem that has been vexing you.'<br />
Pazin Punox says 'An old student of mine who goes by the name Lon has disgraced this House; his betrayal to Innoruuk and Neriak is unforgivable. ' Pazin grins 'He must be punished through deceit and trickery. Make him your friend, do as he asks, and pretend to be Redeemed as he calls it. Once you are Redeemed take the cursed blade of Ro and run it through his heart. Bring me his rapier and his head and I shall know the task is complete.'<br />
