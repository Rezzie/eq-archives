     I am 39 Rogue and  play my sisters druid so I know a them both. You can whoop them but good. Here is how. First have some Gollum wands or pre nurf pumice, Make sure they are hot keyed. Then put on your magic/fire resist gear.  <br />
     Apply you SNARE poison so they can't run away, drink your sow potion. The first second and prolly third thing they will do is try  to snare you. Then dot you. just pumice off the dots and snare and they will already be at half mana. With them snared and you sow'd they will be dead as a door nail.<br />

<br />
1) Pumice the bastard--removes whatever their first buff is (if they're smart, they'll have a junk buff up first--if not, you'll be getting rid of SoW or a Damage Shield...good for you!)<br />
<br />
2) Land a Backstab and Poison at the same time<br />
<br />
Easy, eh?<br />
<br />
Basically, for duels--I tick someone off until they challenge me...once they do I find them, hide, apply a poison (blind or system shock or snare, depending on class)and get ready to accept.  Then I watch them...usually casters will med if they think you're not ready yet...so get behind him, accept the duel and backstab/poison.<br />
<br />
If a melee type, they'll wonder where you are--just get behind them and do the same as with casters.<br />
<br />
You're already way ahead.<br />
<br />
Now stay out of range of the charging melee's attacks (or stay near a caster to interrupt spells and go nuts.<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunting to you.<br />

<br />
1.  Get your MR to 90+<br />
<br />
2.  Get your FR as high as possible (70+ is great, 50+ will do)<br />
<br />
3.  Bring a sow potion with a couple charges.  Make sure you drink one before the fight when he isn't looking  <br />
<br />
4.  Get the best bow you can, and some nice arrows (I hope your archery skill is good.)<br />
<br />
5. Have a fully charged pupmice stone hot-keyed in inventory<br />
If you get snared, target self and hit that baby till you get it off you, timing is key with the increased cast time.  Also, try to get a couple of pumices in on him right off the bat, hopefully you'll kill his damage sheild.<br />
<br />
6.  Open with Muscle Lock (Snare) poison, this will kill his sow, and give you a HUGE advantage.<br />
<br />
7.  Stay on him like white on rice, and land dem backstabs.<br />
<br />
8.  If his damage shield is owning you, back off and bow kite him while you wait for your backstab to rececyle, before moving in to melee again, backstab, back off, rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
9.  Try to kill him before his DoT chews away your HP's, if you're DoTed, without any buffs above it, then pumice it off ASAP.<br />
<br />
G'luck, and give em a stab for me. [b]Ceescrit Bossalini<br />

i think you have forgotten the most important thing...you have to get CLOSE enough to pumice...poison ..ect ect<br />
  i read the BAH BAH..and how easy it is to kill a druid...well thats just crap..hate to say it but  i have a high lvl druid ( coughs with embarassment)...and this 41 rogue....<br />
there is no way in hell a rogue would EVER get close enough to kill a half assed druid....any druid you have killed is one who does not know his char<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aerimus</div><div class="date">04-08-01, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres a clue casters stop to cast during this time melees can catch up with them.  If you end up snared and the snare poison lasts you will die.  Quick movement + dmg shields allows druids to win a fight.  If your enemy manages to take both near the begining of a fight you are dead.</div></div><hr />

Its all up to the player behind the rogue.  Rogue will win 90% if you have the following:<br />
<br />
pillage wands<br />
jboots<br />
blind/snare poison<br />
resists at 90+ for MR/FR<br />
<br />
pillage wand+jboots=deadplayerifherunsaway<br />
<br />
For druids, rip off the DS, sow and skin buffs with 5 charges of pillage, (last I heard jboots was faster than reg. run) pop him/her with a blind poison, and clean your blade off with his/her shirt.  Kill them fast cause I think it hurts their pride more  <br />
<br />
Rangers, same deal cept punch disarm lots and play &quot;kite the ranger for fun&quot; with a bow or boulders.  Try taking his mana pool down with poison if the ranger is a druid wannabe.<br />
<br />
See a necro buff up with DMF and other useless self-buffs before your duel? I start pissing myself with laughter and hit him with a dispell.  Dead necro in 13 seconds using a blind poison.<br />
<br />
Paladins all come down to MR and snare/blind and disarm.  A good paladin will try to root, blind and stun. with 100+ MR, you will resist 90% of them and scare the crap out of them  <br />
<br />
Only class I truely fear is a shaman.  I hear that they can kite AND tank you if slow hits  <br />
<br />
I respect monks/war only as far as their poison resist gear.  IF you have your ripost disc up, use the root+haste poison and stand there and watch them kill themselves on your 100% ripost.<br />
<br />
Note: Biggest complaint from melee and most casters when dueling a rogue- &quot;They keep moving around, I can't him 'em&quot;<br />

I'll take that one  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maximilean</div><div class="date">04-23-01, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the druid keeps his distance, you die.  If the druid's sow is better than Jboots or your sow, then he keeps his distance.<br />
<br />
If the Rogue has 130 of every resist, Jboots against a weak sow, and 30 dispel items in his pants that he uses like an expert, he'll make short work of the druid.  Or a necro.<br />
<br />
The practical problem with these (paper) arguements is that by the time you have the guts to blow hundreds of plat on items in a fight, godlike resists and Jboots, the Druid's sow will be fast enough for him to run.  I dunno, maybe in a duel using all these items is practical, but not in everyday PVP, when people just run for it when they discover a melee has uber-resistance.  <br />
<br />
That's not to say that melees are owned like people think they are if they have good resists and it's just an ordinary fight.  A melee with 2 or 3 dispels and a good set of resists can beat a caster, but I'd say the caster still has a ton of options, particularly as a druid or chanter.<br />
<br />
Hence, my druid and chanter.  I'll get a Rogue when I can afford not to be owned by arse gnome pests for 20 levels.  It's not a question of twinking, it's a question of not wanting to be the playtoy of every 12 year old playing a level 9 necro in Elf newbie grounds.

I've only actually killed 2 or 3 because most of them, like any caster will just run like a pansy when they run out of their precious mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maximilean</div><div class="date">04-23-01, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A rogue can slaughter a druid if he's twinked/simply well equipped high level, but the druid has to assume the position for that close-range fight to ever take place. <br />
<br />
Refusing to engage someone who you cannot cast on isn't being a pansy.  It's &quot;not commiting suicide.&quot;  If the Druid/caster is the one who instigated the fight, you can mock him for running if you want.  If a druid doesn't want to fight your 120s resist monster with 10 pillage wands, he won't.  If you try to annoy him about it, he can ignore you, or at worst say to hell with it and go port to the other side of the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_PoisinDaggerfist</div><div class="date">04-23-01, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Golem wands are easy to get and are instant cast at the same range as any caster spell.  Unload one or 2 of them and you strip off a druids DS and sow... hence, he will never outrun you if he tries to recast sow, or land a dot/nuke cast, and by that time you can stick him with a root poison/blind poison.  Fight over in 30 secs or less.<br />
<br />
And if you are fighting a druid/caster, I drop all AC gear for dragon gear (MR/CR/FR/HP), so even if they get an offensive cast off, it gets resisted.  Untwinked, you can get resists up to 100-150 and add 200-400 hps.<br />
<br />
If you are thinking in straight melee over caster, the key factor why rogues excell above all others in a prepared PvP setting is the poisons that can be applied.<br />
<br />
Golem wands+jboots=caster beatdown<br />
<br />
Note: Mages are a pain, but I found the best way is to target the mage while having applied a root poison and golem wand off his DS and sow.  His pet will attack you and when you ripost the pet, it will get the root poison.  Then start picking away at him with arrows or your dagger of choice...

If you really want to go all out, get some potions: haste, sow, resist, and regen.  Definitely pumice his buffs and use a bow vs. Damage shield.<br />

When he starts casting, move into the water and his spells can't land. <br />
<br />
Another interesting thing is, casters with sow (those that run faster than you)will always try and kite you. Basically, what you do is if they don't run far enough away to get a spell off, you can just catch up to them. And if you think they got enough space off, just run the exact opposite direction out of casting range. That way, they can't really kite you. <br />
<br />
Finally, get a dungeon! DO NOT FIGHT IN OPEN AREAS! you will get owned every time.</div></div><hr />
