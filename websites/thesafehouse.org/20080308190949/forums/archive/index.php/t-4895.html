<br />
15 Base Left axe, +3 to L axe from malm gaunts, +1 (x2) to L axe from Golden alloy axes + 2 realm points = 22 L axe, which has been just fine for me.<br />
<br />
Other spiffy thing about L axe is if you go axe/axe you get the weapon bonuses off both weapons which is a great boost to general dmg (currently +4 axe form each axe = +8 to axe total). This isnt even including the other bonuses/benifits of the weapons.<br />
<br />
I also enjoy being able to use two poisons as well.<br />
<br />
Most Sbs feel L axe is the one skill that can be safely ignored in their quest to become uuber, and they are right. However, since our chance to one-shot other players continually shrinks as we lvl, I find I use L axe much more often of late and with great results.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to share something positive about L axe, since its sometimes the Sb whipping boy skill unless yer a SZ  <br />
