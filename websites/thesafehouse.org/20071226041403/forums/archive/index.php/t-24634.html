I have all of Rayearth and a few more shows from them that I cant remember off the top.  So I dont think its neccessarly that reason entirelly.<br />
<br />
I keep thinking it was the name.  Had some friends that were reading the titles of a lot of anime I buy and just really didnt feel like having them comment on the 'xxx' part at the time.  Explaining to them that its wildcard placeholders instead of porn would have fallen upon deaf ears.  <br />
At the time they were trying to prove that all anime is porn to some degree. And were basing their judgement on titles and dvd covers. :(</div></div><hr />

Altho im sure they will tie in somewhere.</div></div><hr />
