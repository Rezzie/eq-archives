What! The vizard walks on air?! Well, whatever. The show has a good mix of comedy and action as always. Apparently Ishida's father shows up, gee I wonder where this is going?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-14-07, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So much awsome **** this episode.  King Fisher is back.  I totally expected King Fisher would become a hybrid shinigami/hollow way back at the end of the Aizen arc when they revealed what the black orb did.  I mean, King Fisher is supposed to be an important enemy for Ichigo, and by the end of the Aizen arc, if Ichigo ever fought King Fisher again he'd kill it in 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
I'm dissapointed that King Fisher doesn't seem like a more important hybrid though.  It seems like he's going to be one of the prototypes.  Which means he's probably going to die early on.<br />
<br />
I thought it was interesting that the black orb works both ways.  We know Aizen took it because it can make Shinigami into Hollows, but with King Fisher, it also obviously makes Hollows into Shinigami.<br />
<br />
Ishida's dad is a badass despite previous us being led to believe he quit being a Quincy!<br />
<br />
And then that kickass Menos Grande.<br />
<br />
Vaizards!It's only the first episode of the arc and I'm already on the edge of my nuts!<br />

Also, ultimate fanservice powah with Matsumoto in schoolgirl uniform in the ending.</div></div><hr />

Actually all I meant was that anything I've missed in the meantime won't affect what's coming so if I don't get the chance to watch it, which is likely, it won't matter.<br />

Actually you said it started the filler.  The part missing to bring it all together is that the Bounto arc is, apparently, the entirety of the filler.  This was not clear for someone who hasn't watched since shortly after the filler started.<br />
<br />
 <br />
And I generally refer to anyone mopey and annoying as Emo. It's one letter away from Elmo!<br />
<br />
Ok, just FYI.  The term emo came out of the hardcore punk scene in the late mid to late 80s DC as a dersive term for bands in the area which were focusing more on emotional and self-questioning topics in their lyrics, instead of being politicly charged.  While styles and and fashion have fluctuated over the years, the oddest change in the last few years has been the co-opting of the word emo to mean anyone from mopey to angst ridden &quot;omg I cut myself to relieve the pain the world sucks let me die!!&quot; attitudes.<br />
<br />
But that's never what emo was.  And the bands labelled as emo have never really taken that label on themselves really either.  There's nothing that really links many of them except an external misinterpretation of them as gloomy everything sucks depression cases, often thrown in is the belief they are suicidal and gay (because obviously, emotions are homosexual).<br />
<br />
Ok, sorry for the mini-rant.  The whole emo-hate thing lately has just been getting to me far too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
WTF!? is right.  And did he say he was a captain? or just that he had captain level power because he could control the size of his zanpakutou?  It did seem to come out of nowhere. It is also disappointing to me that Ichigo is a &quot;pureblood&quot; or whatever now.</div></div><hr />

He didn't come out and say it, but he said all captains control the size of their swords otherwise they would be wielding skyscrapers like his.  Also I don't buy pure blooded Shinigami.  His dad yes, but they say nothing of his mom, who is dead.  Half-blood at best.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The hollow said pure-blood. I think the meaning was more that he has pure-blood in him, not that he's FULL-blooded.<br />
 <br />
And i was still going WTF?!?!?!?!? anyway. Loserdad = captain-level Shinigami?!?!?! I find that hard to swallow.</div></div><hr />

Well, I was mostly referring to the &quot;existing super-strong squad.&quot;<br />
<br />
We've already seen all the super strong people and their abilities. Well, most. We need new strong people to keep things interesting. Chad and Inoue are sidekicks that progress with Ichigo.</div></div><hr />

Mmm, good episode.<br />
<br />
I originally thought that both Grand Fisher and the Vaizard were working for Aizen, but this episode showed otherwise.<br />
<br />
And if I'd had to guess which group was Aizen's I would have guessed the Vaizard, since they are shinigami into Hollows, but that turns out not to be the case.<br />
<br />
the Vaizard are actually pretty funny...I'm betting their gonna end up just like Ishida, supposedly hating Shinigami, yet always fighting on Ichigo's side.<br />
<br />
Still, they are offering to teach him to control his Hollow self, which actually seems like a pretty good thing if he stopped to think about it.<br />
<br />
I'm glad Grand Fisher was a &quot;test Arrancar&quot; and they are gonna be more powerful as the arc goes on, because GF died way too easy.<br />
<br />
This episode seemed to have more humor than anything else.</div></div><hr />

Ya ichigo's dad pwning him in one shot was weak heh. If I remember right Aizen wanted to become or make the perfect hollow...the Vaizard are prob considered to human still. I think the Vaizard seem to just want more power but also be in control of that power (prob more on the control side). Arrancar seem like more &quot;pure blood&quot; hollows that inbrace their inner hate and don't want to have control of themselves. They just want to be pure powerhouse killing forces.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Hell, Mai-HiME has two -completely- different stories.<br />
<br />
True. Don't really care but if they kept falling back on the filler then it would be annoying IMO...<br />
<br />
But didn't Mai-HiME plan for 2 completely different stories?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-02-07, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I find annoying is not that the anime changed things from the manga. Sometimes this is a good thing, other times it's a bad thing. The reason it's annoying is because they are suddenly incorporating the filler, instead of following the manga faithfully. If the changes were common througout the series, I wouldn't have minded.<br />
<br />
But what annoys me even more than that is how they are attempting to cover the plot holes. I don't care if they leave plot holes in filler, but using the main story to fill it up is cheap. I know all the explainations so far are ********. They make no sense and are just there because they think the audience is too stupid to know why the holes are there.<br />
<br />
Just leave them behind, I don't care about the bound arc! You're just wasting time! Get MOVING ALREADY!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">03-03-07, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the things I've always been impressed with in the anime industry is how faithful they are to the source material.  You don't get that in animated versions of american comics.<br />
<br />
The reason most filler sucks is that it just plain sucks, not because it doesn't tie back in to the story when the source gets under way again.  Do things have to be exactly like the manga?  No, things get slightly altered in the interest of format considerations, but inserting a large story sequence and then continuing to refer back to it just messes with the original formula too much... and when it comes down to it, that original formula is why the show exists in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">03-03-07, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking as someone who liked the Bounto arc, I still wish they'd stop interfering with the main arc here.<br />
<br />
You know,  cause I want to see it the way the author intended, but I can't read.  So...there ya go.<br />

I was really dissapointed in the Arrancars performance.  From his size, I assumed he was a Vasto Lorde, and that means he was supposed to be stronger than a Captain BEFORE he became an Arrancar, and he got one-shotted by Rukia of all people who, I realize she's badass all of a sudden, but she almost died to a really crappy Hollow in the first episode.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 <br />
The other arrancar referred to him as a failure, and that he wasn't supposed to come along in the first place, so I'm guessing he wasn't as 'complete' as the others. Grimmjow's reiatsu seems to be miles above the other one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">03-03-07, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With regards to Rukia (I don't think I need to spoiler this since it's based on the first twenty or so episodes), even though I've only watched up to episode 25 the basis of how Ichigo became a soul reaper and what he could do with his power tells me that Rukia is a badass when she becomes able to unleash all her spirit energy.<br />
<br />
Ichigo was borrowing Rukia's spirit energy for the first 20ish episodes (which was why Rukia couldn't turn into a soul reaper and never regained her powers in those episodes).  Using Rukia's energy Ichigo defeated loads of hollows including beating back the Menos and beating up Renji.  That tells me Rukia does have serious power, but probably something in her upbringing limited her into thinking she didn't have that kind of power available to her.  Since Ichigo was given Rukia's spirit energy with no instructions of how to use it, he was oblivious to how much energy he was drawing upon, and how much energy Rukia had in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">03-03-07, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to mention that Ichigo had a ton of spirit power in the first place, which is why Hollow #1 attacked him.<br />
 <br />
Darf:<br />
 <br />
As for Rukia getting hurt fighting Hollow #1, It's been awhile since I've seen the first episode; but wasn't she distracted, trying to save Ichigo, and that is how she got injured?</div></div><hr />

About the episode:<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Some of Grimmjow's animation was fantastic, esp. where his hollow-mask started to follow his mouth movements. The little boxer-style bob&amp;weave he did a bit before that was a great touch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-11-07, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree completely about Grimmjow.<br />
<br />
The opening though has me worried.  It makes it look like Inoue joins Aizen.  On the one hand, I can't imagine what could happen that would make her do that.  On the other, it would mean that at least she wouldn't be doing nothing for another entire arc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the looks of it, it looks like Inoue joined Aizen either because she was jealous of Rukia or she was kidnapped. Personally, I hope she did it on purpose as it would make for a much more interesting story. Also, was it just me or did it look like Sado leveled up his arm thing in the new opening?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Just so happens they released it on a day when there was no bleach.<br />
 <br />
There would have been an announcement had they dropped it.</div></div><hr />

Dattebayo picks up Genshiken Season 2, Bleach dropped<br />
<br />
2007/10/11<br />
<br />
Dattebayo is proud to announce that we will be subtitling the show &quot;Genshiken Season 2&quot;. We encourage you to first watch the hilarious season one of Genshiken available on DVD from AnimeWorks, who generally does a good job with releases.<br />
<br />
Genshiken 2 is a 12 episode extension of the original 12 episode and 3 Genshiken OAV series.<br />
<br />
This show is a lot different from our normal fare and introduces some new staff members to our team. Please send us your feedback and let us know what you think of the show.<br />
<br />
--The Genshiken Team<br />
<br />
Due to complexity of the new series and also due to schedule conflict with Bleach, Dattebayo regrettably announces that Genshiken will replace Bleach on our anime lineup.</div></div><hr />

I'd  be surprised if they actually did.  DB is notorious for ******** 'updates' .. they have several times dropped Naruto (on off weeks) or said they were switching to  Hebrew only subs of all anime series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">10-13-07, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">like the time they 'dropped' naruto for pokeman.<br />
 <br />
Man, that was funny.</div></div><hr />

Dattebayo does that periodically just to get people on forums worked up in a furor...</div></div><hr />

And that scene where Ishida and the arrancar were using their &quot;flash step&quot; ripoffs?  If they hadn't been talking about it, I wouldn't have even know they were moving fast.<br />

It just seemed like what should have been a good episode ruined by very lazy animation.</div></div><hr />

It may be the crazy in me but I drew alot of connections between him and drizzt in exile. Think about it, if his release he two scimitars I'll poop myself. If his bankai is a black panther, well... I just don't know.</div></div><hr />
