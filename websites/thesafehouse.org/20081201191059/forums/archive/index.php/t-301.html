  <br />
 Back when I was 14, I tried to get into a group with an RL friend of mine.  His group was full so I started giving him some crap.   <br />
  <br />
 (he was a 16 ranger in full ivy-etched, ssom, etc.)   <br />
  <br />
 They pull an orc warrior (red to me)  and start fighting it.  I come in, and every backstab hits.  I keep hitting for full with my DD and bloodclaw (of course it doesn't proc yet). <br />
 Then I see the message: <br />
  <br />
 You have slain an orc warrior <br />
 You gain experience. <br />
  <br />
 Of course, he'll probably return the favor now.  He's 22 and I'm only 16. <br />

  <br />
 When I was  34-35 Rogue, I was down in Oggok with a group of guild mates and we were killing bouncers. Also there were 2 more higher levelers there grouped by themselves, killing bouncers(they were in the guild also) <br />
  <br />
 Ranger and a Druid. Ranger 39-40 Druid like 45. The druid was healing, no nuke or Dot action, as the Ranger was working it over. Bieng a guild mate and all, I went over to offer some assistance. <br />

  <br />
 ????..... heheh, oops ;) <br />

 Anyone use a lvl 21?  ( I think thats what I was.)   <br />
 Sure, come down to the Warlord room. <br />
 Ok. OMW <br />
  <br />
 Now, to my surpirse I see my group (not grouped) engaged with the Goblin King.  I don't want to see them die,  then I'd have to spend another hour trying to get a group. <br />
  <br />
 Needless to say, like the previous stories I never missed.  The King dropped and I was amazed to see that I got the exp.  Well the battle was going bad and turning worse,  I think the elite guards spawned, and those dumm greens decided to join in the slaughter.  I recovered my senses and performed a delayed ninja loot, not even stopping to look at my catch. <br />
  <br />
 I died in the fray, and so did everyone else.  It seems like so long ago. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Despana</div><div class="date">01-24-00, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rogue's backstab is a wonderful revenge weapon to use against KS'ers. <br />
  <br />
 Example: This past friday, I was in Blackburrow camping and soloing elites and commanders. I had just taken a beating from one commander, but killed him, and was sitting to heal while I waited for the next spawn. <br />
  <br />
     Just as I see an elite spawn, I hear the door behind me open. I rise to my feet, but before I can even take one step towards the gnoll, an anonymous finger twiddler steps up and blasts the gnoll to oblivion. <br />
      I told him that I had been camping the room for the tougher gnolls. His response? <br />
    &quot;I don't care, you weren't attacking it.&quot; <br />
     I explained to to him that I had just climbed to my feet, but he didn't even bother to listen and just turned aroudn and left. Had he said something as simple as &quot;Sorry, my mistake&quot;, or &quot;Sorry, I didn't know.&quot;, that would have been the end of it. <br />
     But he was a jerk and I didn't like his attitude. So I followed him. Everywhere he went. He got a few lesser gnolls and killed them before I could do anything about it. But when he went back to the room I had been camping and stumbled across another elite, I leapt into action.  <br />
      I swung behind the gnoll, and slammed him with my Dragoon Dirk, then pounded him as fast and furiously as I could, getting in two more successful backstabs. When he fell, I was rewarded with that happy little yellow message. <br />
  <br />
 You have gained experience. <br />
  <br />
 The fingertwiddler called me a few names, and I laughed all the way home. <br />

Well I was in Oasis myself when my backstab showed iuts true colors. Proud of just achieeing the 15th lvl by way of killing sisters of erollisi (I being a Dark Elf) I went to the Oasis of Marr in my handmade suit of armor to beat up on the crocodiles there. Well everyone in the oasis was young (being on Lanys T;Vyl server we all were) and could not handle some of the terors of the deep that wandered the place. One being the infamous Lockjaw, a croc bigger than an ogre. <br />
  <br />
 So the unspoken policy was for the entire zone to pounce on the bastard and see who gets the kill. Well while the warriors and paladins went head first into Lockjaw's Trap-like mouth, I lingered behind and utilized my unique backstab, being onee of the only rogues there. Well when it was all over, I had gotten the experience. All the wizards present wondered what happened. Even a necro, who had been leeching away as his pet pounded wondered what was going on. Then I, a lone dark elf with a giant snake fang, looted the large gator. I wear the tunic I fashioned from his thick hide to this day. <br />
  <br />
 (A side note, I love hearing about all the lvl 15ish rogues with dragoon dirks and bloodclaws, for on Lanys these items sell at ridiculous prices and are so rarely equipped. I should have a dirk, but being a dark elf I have not bothered to camp D;Vinn. I still proudly weild my FS rapier and my dwarven axe -- soon to be upgraded to a combine spear and a tent whip. What fun a new server is!) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kilfara</div><div class="date">02-03-00, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is another, more ruthless way to KS, though it's not EXACTLY KSing.  It's also more roguish, and definitely more interesting for you 'eviw' Dark Elves.  This happened to me recently, though I didn't do it on purpose, this time.  A fellow fighting a Legionnaire started calling for help, so I ran over.  Being lvl 9, I don't have backstab (i'm 2.5 bubbles away!!!) so I can't do a lot of damage.  I tried, but the guy ended up dying, leaving a red lego with 20% health.  I finished off the creature and got the exp.  Then I realized how ruthless one could be to do that on purpose.  Now, can anyone think of something more ruthless than to watch another person get slaughtered, and then once their finished, steal their kill (kinda).  Mmmm.... <br />

I thought it was just a newbie grounds thing when I saw it happen a couple of times with my secondary character, but I've seen whole groups in the 30-40 range sit by and watch people or groups get slaughtered so they can get the kill (though it is much much rarer at higher levels).<br />
<br />
My favorite KSing experience was in Mistmoore in the Butler room.  I (lvl 35) was just about to join the lvl 50 ranger camping there when a vampire placeholder spawned.  I knew the ranger wasn't going to get experience from it so I jumped on it a second or two after he started on it.  This was a lvl 50 ranger in planes gear wielding a flux axe primary and a mistwalker offhand.  I got lucky with some good backstabs and his lack of procs and got the kill.  Sure was humbling for him though to see that.  *grins* Arie<br />

I was 38 I believe, and roaming into oggok to look for a heal (was out front taking bouncers with a 50 shaman, him kiting, e stabbing), and stumbled upon two ladies I know.  A 47 paladin and a 46 cleric, both from a guild I had been trying to join.  I walked over and took some swipes, didn't even fully attack, and got the kill.  I felt really bad asking for a heal after that</div></div><hr />

-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You: Man, the (insert name of rare spawn, with great exp/loot) just spawned in front of me!<br />
<br />
Auto attack on.<br />
<br />
You: Hah, no problem...this is great, I'll get the loot all to myself!<br />
<br />
(insert name of ruthless KSer) is hit by (insert name of the big bad monster of your zone) for (lots for your level) points of damage!<br />

(big bad NPC) hits YOU for (lots) points of damage!<br />
<br />
You have been slain by (big bad NPC)!<br />

Due to his level and skill he probably didnt inflict most of the damage to the monk.  BTW its really great when you find ppl powerleveling like that, most of the time one poke from a dagger of dropping will give you the exp</div></div><hr />

I was crowded like always, so I found myself wandering far from the docks in search of anything blue.<br />
<br />
I wandered all the way to the SRO zone and saw a Sand Giant chasing some little guy through the zone. I clicked on the giant and then looked at my &quot;current target&quot; box. &quot;it must be a glitch&quot; I thought, for there was NO red in the box. Just &quot;a sand giant&quot; against grey.<br />
<br />
Then it hit me, the giant had only a few HP left. It stood there facing the zone, with it's back to me...with only a feeeeeew HP. I charged at the giant full force and got off a backstab around 15 I think. It wasn't much, but it did the trick. <br />
<br />
And that's how at level 12 I soloed a sand giant.<br />

<br />
My group was absolutely pouncing on the spawn, and though it is sometimes overwhelming, we had it under control by ourselves.  Another group of 3 or 4 comes in, all nukers except for the leader (a warrior several levels higher than me).  They did not ask to share, and like everyone else, commenced to KS.  So my group, which was melee heavy, had to kill everything that moved and hope for XP.  We were very organized, and doing quite well.  Several times, myself, and the opposing warrior were the only two on an orc, so I always got the kill, and made him tank it, using evade.  Other times I thought my group was behind me, and started to attack the same one their entire group was on.  This is how, on several occasions, I alone managed to outdamage their entire group.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I heard the leader shouting &quot;Orc group looking for rogues.&quot;<br />

AS long as the mob doesn't speak and tell you can practice Pick Pocket too...  But watch out.. if you get carried away you can easily KS...<br />
I was in EC on level 12, trying to build BS.  I couldn't find a good derv group so I was BSing orcs at camp 1.  I wasn't watching and I started in on a leggo this group was fighting... I BSed about six times at 32 dam a BS and I saw a little yellow message &quot;You have gained Experience!&quot;  I immediatley appologized to them but their leader, a wizard, was so mad he challenged me to a duel.  Think about it... a lower level wizard, after a big fight, challenged me, a higher rouge, to a duel.  Needless to say when he saw my BS hit him he knew he had messed up but he deserved to die so I didn't let up.  After he got back he told me &quot;Now fight me when it's even.&quot; and he did it again!  I snuck hide behind him and accepted... watching him flail around for a few minutes was fun then I hit him and kept on him...  He couldn't cast a single spell...  He asked how I did that and I said, &quot;I'm just good that way.&quot;  His entire group watched both battles and not a one of them to this day will every decline when a rogue asks to join their group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had a SoW, was heading back to Freeport from Oasis to call it a night and do my banking..<br />
<br />
I zoned into No Ro next to Derv 3. Derv 3 had a full spawn of 3. I go up to the usually camp spot and see 3 folk and 2 dead chars..<br />
<br />
I say &quot;Hello sires, what happened? Bad pull?&quot;<br />
<br />
no answer...<br />
<br />
I say &quot;I'm free for a few, do you need help breaking the spawn.&quot;<br />
<br />
no answer.. They are moving so I know they aren't afk..<br />
<br />
one walks up to me and inspects me without asking. (I hate that!)<br />
<br />
/em blush<br />
<br />
Player says, &quot;Oh so your shy?&quot;<br />
<br />
(gee so they do know how to talk and that I am talking to them)<br />
<br />
About 5 minutes have gone by.. The other 2 show up and retrive corpses.. Now there are 5 people just standing around staring at me and the 3 dervs..<br />
<br />
I /who them and see they are either anon or around 13th season. Casters and a WAR.<br />
<br />
I /con the mobs, green caster, blue caster and blue with bronze spear..<br />
<br />
About 5 minute go by..<br />
<br />
I say &quot;SO, If you gents are not going to do anything, can I pull??&quot; <br />
<br />
no response.. Starting to thing these guys are braindead or jerks.<br />
<br />
I say &quot;Well then, I can solo at least 2 of them, if I get into trouble will you help or laugh??&quot;<br />
<br />
Player 1 says &quot;Laugh&quot;<br />
Player 2 says &quot;HaHaHa&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok now I know, they are not braindead, just major dicks.<br />
<br />
Just then they make there move and pull one caster, other caster joins in.. Bronze stays at camp...<br />
<br />
I hit hide/sneak, SoW down to 3rd spawn with Bronze, BS him for 42 points, a few quick sticks from my Dirk and Dagger and he falls without me breaking a sweat. As his corpse hit the ground I looted Bronze spear, a Derv ring, coin and a Jewel. I then promptly hit hide.<br />
<br />
While the jerks are still getting cleaned by the 2 Casters, they NEVER even saw where the 3rd spawn (and all its loot) went. <br />
<br />
They were just finishing up thier battle as I sneak strolled right through their little party laughing to myself all the way to the bank...<br />

<br />
That is so true its not even funny. Highpass is so unorderly on the Povar server that there is almost ALWAYS a GM hidden or stationed by. I dont even understand why some classes (like rogues) even bother to have a group there when they can KS it all by themselves. Frankly, I think the GM's are getting tired of hearing:<br />
<br />
Ellroy: That rogue KSed from me<br />
GM: Where are you<br />
Ellroy: Highpass<br />
GM: Ill be on my way to inspect the situation (I dont give a crap)<br />
<br />
WHICH MAKES IT ALL THE BETTER TO KS<br />
<br />
&quot;Need help with that?&quot;<br />
You gain experience!<br />
&quot;Oops sorry&quot;</div></div><hr />

He had just started stealing our kills without even saying a word to us. So the next tae he pulled was the Archon, which I promptly started attacking, I had augment from the enchanter and shaman strength so I was hitting fast and hard. I swear it I didn't miss 1 attack in that fight, even got one of my beloved 8 attack rounds. Needless to say I got the kill and got the RS arms (even though I already had some). He proceeded to ooc, but I just told him theres no point trying to KS from his god, which got him good and pissed. I walked away happy.  <br />
