<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to clear up some things since there is conflicting information.<br />
<br />
Info from the devs (http://boards.cityofheroes.com/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Board=general&amp;Number=326697&amp;bodyprev=#Post326697)<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's how Enhancements currently work:<br />
<br />
General for all Enhancements<br />
Enhancements that show Green<br />
Add 1% per each level difference<br />
Example, Level 20 hero with a 20++ enhancement gets 2% added to the enhancement bonus<br />
<br />
Enhancements that show White<br />
Operate at a normal bonus<br />
<br />
Enhancements that show Yellow<br />
Subtract 1% per each level difference<br />
Example, Level 20 hero with level 19 enhancement gets 1% subtracted from the enhancement bonus<br />
<br />
Enhancements that show Red<br />
No bonus whatsoever<br />
Only use is to try and combine with a higher level enhancement<br />
<br />
Training Enhancements<br />
Provide a 5% or 8.3% bonus, depending on specific enhancement used<br />
<br />
Single Origin Enhancements<br />
Provide a 20% or 33.3% bonus, depending on specific enhancement used<br />
<br />
Dual Origin Enhancements<br />
Provide a 10% or 16.7% bonus, depending on specific enhancement used<br />
<br />
The specific bonus that is given is listed by Enhancement in the strat guide.<br />
<br />
Combining vs. Stacking<br />
Stacking means having 2 identical enhancements in different slots on the same power.<br />
Stacking enhancements will produce better results<br />
As an example of how this works, I will use a power with base damage of 10<br />
<br />
Training Enhancement<br />
Adding a same level training damage enhancement, will give damage of 10, 10 + .83 = 10.83 ( Note from Poz: The game rounds down any decimals when showing damage inflicted numbers, but the actual damage caused keeps the decimal damage to count towards total damage inflicted)<br />
Combining another training damage enhancement will give damage of 10, 10 + .93 = 10.93<br />
Socketing a second training damage enhancement will give damage of 11, 10 +.83 + .83 = 11.66<br />
<br />
Dual Origin Enhancement<br />
Adding a same level dual origin damage enhancement will give a damage of 11, 10 + 1.167 = 11.167<br />
Combining another dual origin damage enhancement will give damage of 11, 10 + 1.77 = 11.77<br />
Socketing another dual origin damage enhancement will give damage of 13, 10 + 3.34 = 13.34<br />
<br />
Single Origin Enhancement<br />
Adding a same level single origin damage enhancement will give a damage of 13, 10 + 3.33 = 13.33<br />
Combining another single origin damage enhancement will give damage of 13, 10 + 3.43 = 13.43<br />
Socketing another single origin damage enhancement will give damage of 16, 10 + 6.66 = 16.66<br />
<br />
Most powers have a limit to the bonuses that enhancements can provide, so filling all of your sockets with damage enhancements will not give a bonus higher than the limit for that power.<br />

This information was paraphrased from the strat guide. Believe it or not, this strat guide actually contains useful information.</div></div><hr />
