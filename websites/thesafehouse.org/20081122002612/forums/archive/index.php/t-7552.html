<br />
Cast blind on a pet, it will run away and once the blind wears off, it will poof.<br />
<br />
Verant knows about this, it was used on BoTB events and such, so feel free to use it since nobody at VI cares to fix it.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if ppl have had success with the blind poisons and this having the same effect.  Rodcet Nife Ring Warden <br />

<br />
Only one that I knew about is the bard charm song poofing pets.  Bards are so ghey, they still haven't fixed them being able to fear/charm in PvP.  [b]Ceescrit Bossalini<br />

<br />
fearing is AE, I've asked some guides who said its ok, even though Feared Pc sports a LD-sign when feared<br />

<br />
What I was always hoping for is that pet wanders too far off its master for him/her to control it, but then.. it always finds ME back hehe <br />

Your pets are pretty much worthless in PvP.  They're nice to have for an occassional spell interrupt, but other than that, you don't need them at all.  Only think pet's are good for in PvP is getting them trained onto guards.  Yes, mages aren't crap without their pets, but still. [b]Ceescrit Bossalini<br />

I tried the pet bug, it didn't work.  Playing my enchanter, I dueled a necromancer and blinded his pet.  It ran off and then back at me when the eye of confusion wore off.</div></div><hr />

Blind doesn't kill them, it just makes them run off for a while, and then they'll come back, every time. Cancel magic on the pet's target MAY cause the pet to poof still, occasionally, but it's rare.  Malleus McGuinness -  - Vallon Zek<br />

I've not seen it caused by blinding but if the Shaman dispells his opponent that is interpreted by the pet as a beneficial spell.  <br />
