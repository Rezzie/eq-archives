 The first one: <br />

 The second one: <br />
 /smile <br />
 : has picked your pocket <br />
 : has stolen 9 gold 7 silver and 60 copper <br />

 I alternated these two with a few people.  I got one 31st level palidin.</div></div><hr />

Don't leave them alone just keep begging.  Then pretend you are trying to offer then a deal.  &quot;Ok look,  I have 15 pp and this dragoon dirk,  with you give me that ebony bladed sword?  Cmon please?  Help a newbie oh cmon! pleeeeease&quot; <br />

 Worse one was a low level rogue who bother me for days trying to get me to trade my SBD for rubicite pants, then bracers, then helm.   <br />
  <br />
 I traded Rubicite greeves to a NON Rogue for my SBD and it was the deal of a lifetime.  Why then would I want to give up my most powerful weapon for rubicite anything.  Bother a non-rogue.... ack. <br />

 If ya beg from an NPC enough they kill ya, and most people quit begging from them after this happens a couple of times,,So it could make them think twice. Sloren, Humble Hafling of Tunare()<br />

 Yes Sloren, you are a fine halfing women. Smart and cunning, and ya keep  your pockets filled with the biguns gold.  That idea is great, I usally hand out some nice shiny's, but next one on my coattails, I shall take them to the arena for a new definition of pain! <br />
  <br />
 It would work, just say wait here, or take the long route and lead them thru it.  Or even better get them to use auto-follow.  They still get that little message they entered a pvp arnea.  Just depends on how dumb &amp; greedy they are. Wixramiablo SneakypantsCovenant of Peace_________________________DeepPocket of Rodect Nife</div></div><hr />

  <br />
 Well don't take that previous post the wrong way, I am very kind to others, but every now and then, you get a pest you would like to get rid of. I will be tempted to try it next time I get hounded for free stuff, but I don't think I havethe heart to do it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">08-25-99, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this was a while back but I still remember it clearly as it was the most annoying beggar I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with: <br />
  <br />
 There I was, minding my own buisness at 16th level when I get a tell &quot;Will you group with me?&quot; Now, being a rogue that imediately made me suspicious so I do a who on the guy and, hmm, an 8rd level monk. I explain that he won't get any xp and neither will I for that matter. Ok, guy sends me a tell saying he's the brother of a guy I grouped with twice and then tells me he needs some help killing desert madmen and dervishes in N Ro. So I figure what the heck, I'll help him out with 1-2 of them. Get there, group with him and what does he say? &quot;I don't want the xp, I just want (all) the money and the gems they have&quot;. Um, and what am I getting from this partnership? Anything? Well, there comes the desert madman, attack, oops, there comes the mummy too, um, make that two mummies. Tell little idjut to run, idjut starts screaming for help, ok, get lucky and an 18th lvl paladin steps in and saves my sorry behind. Results? I'm diseased at 1 and half bubble, idjut monk is at 4 bubbles, paladin is perfectly fine and we have killed one mummy, which the idjut promptly loots (no auto-loot on for him of course). Then he starts going on about how he desperately needs gems. So I'm fed up at this point and leave. Next day: I have confirmed with the guy I grouped with that this is his little brother. So I get tell saying &quot;Will you buy me a lockjaw tunic?&quot;. I do a who on the guy and he's a 5th level monk. He then tells me he's the same guy from last nigit playing a different char. Then I tell him I'm not that rich. &quot;Ok, will you kill lockjaw and get me the tunic then?&quot; Um, me? Kill lockjaw at 16th? When I can hardly find groups in less than 3 hours and LJ is camped to hell? I think not. Ok, so he keeps going on and on about how he desperately needs the tunic so he can play his character. Yeah, right, just like I absolutely need an SBD to play my character. I try to explain all this to him. Results? &quot;Can you please help me get a lockjaw tunic?&quot; I explain more, I use simple words. Results? &quot;Can you come to Crushbone and help me kill things?&quot; At this point I'm through being nice, the idjut's brother was a nice enough person but enough is enough, no I'm not going to wait 2 hours for a boat that will crash so I can come over and bail your hide out after you try to attack Crush and DVinn expecting me to give all the loot we get to you. /ignore idjut. Ah, I love filters almost as much as I'd have loved killing him - but I wasn't going to go to Kaladim to do that. <br />
  <br />
 Now these days when I get a tell like &quot;Can you give me and my friend a full set of banded?&quot; from a 2nd level, I just put them on ignore. I can't be bothered raising my blood preassure for them. I just wish we could do unlimited ignore - there seem to be unlimited idiot beggars after all. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Doc Gonzo</div><div class="date">09-15-99, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I, having been born in Queynos, make it a point to return there every few levels (just a level 17 now anyway).   When I do I alway do a quick /who rogue to see who is the lowest level rogue in the area.   After a few (in character)  /tells I usually load the buggers up with a few items of loot (ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ALL THAT VALUABLE.)  Typical set will include: <br />
   <br />
 1 backpack  <br />
 2-3 pieces of rawhide armor  <br />
 1 decent weapon (nothing better than a normal steel rapier for instance -- and only given two of these away)  <br />
 1 or 2 Div Rings  <br />
 1 studded collar  <br />
 5 plats  <br />
   <br />
 Made some great friends and been forgotten about after having do this.   Once, I /tell a brand new rogue ... playing time in EQ total?  less than 10 minutes ... we still talk and she's becoming a great friend.     <br />
   <br />
 Others I wish I could remember their names cause I'd like to ask for a refund ;-)  <br />
