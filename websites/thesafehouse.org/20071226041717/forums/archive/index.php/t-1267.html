<br />
Quote:It's for real! Anime Network is a full-fledged cable network. <br />
<br />
No longer only available as Video On Demand, Anime Network has inked a deal with one of the 10 largest cable providers in the country. In celebration of this momentous occasion, Anime Network has engineered one kick a** sweepstakes with mind boggling prizes. As a Grand prize winner you not only get to 'turn on' the network on June 30th, you also get to be the FIRST HUMAN BEING on the network. Yes, it's very hard to top the grand prize but we have sweetened the pot a little more by throwing in a Phillips 30&quot; Widescreen HD-Ready Flat Tube TV with Active Control as well as the complete collection of limited edition Anime Network Official Launch GEAR. As hard as it is to believe, the First prize winner will walk away contented with their prize package, which includes Phillips 30&quot; Widescreen HD-Ready Flat Tube TV with Active Control and the complete collection of limited edition Anime Network Official Launch GEAR. Two Second prizes will be awarded that include VIP pack of Anime Network Official Launch merchandise and apparel. And last but certainly not least, 25 lucky Third prize winners will receive a limited edition Anime Network Official Launch T-Shirt. <br />
<br />
This sweepstakes is running for a limited time, so hurry up and enter TODAY! <br />
<br />
It would be nice for it to no longer be just a VoD provider.   Edited by: Ackar at: 4/29/04 3:18 pm</div></div><hr />

Golden Boy, Blue Sedd, Full Metal Panic, Excel Saga, Bakaretsu Hunters, Those Who Hunt Elves, Chobits, CITY HUNTER, Sakura Wars... &amp;lt;BREATHE&gt;.... And so many more that I've been wanting to check out. I'm drooling so much I'm gonna dehydrate. This it great news.   Ooohh.. so shiney!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-29-04, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anime Networks shows some good anime. Just from looking at their list, these are the ones I would say are good.<br />
<br />
Azumanga Daioh<br />
Excel Saga<br />
Golden Boy<br />
Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi<br />
Chobits<br />
Pretear<br />
Angelic Layer<br />
Bubblegum Crisis<br />
Kino's Journey<br />
Neon Genesis Evangelion<br />
RahXephon<br />
Voices of the Distant Star<br />
Gasaraki<br />
Boogiepop Phantom<br />
Samurai X (The Kenshin OVA's)<br />
<br />
I don't really remember the other ones too well, the ones above are the only ones that made a lasting impression on me. In any case, that's a large list of good anime IF they are indeed showing them all. I've never watched the Anime Networks myself, but I will defiently be if they show up subbed or captioned (cross fingers).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just so there's no confusion, I'm trying to say that the ones above are definently not B-list anime. They are very popular ones.  Edited by: Stalkyr Weaksoul at: 4/29/04 3:14 pm</div></div><hr />

In Cowboy Bebop, the dubbing was done very well - same with certain versions of FMA, and with DBZ, dubbing is almost required. Without it, Goku sounds like a whiny little girl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bladesake</div><div class="date">04-29-04, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed, Bebop did have great dubbing. I *think* that's why I can't get into Big O. That's Spike's voice, damnit!</div></div><hr />

There's a huge ban on anime in my town, not sure why, but I can't even get Adult Swim...so I'm sure Anime Network won't won't make it.<br />

Capitalize the first letter of the sentence. OMG LOLLERZ PWNEDZ0R.<br />
<br />
Sorry, with the grammar nazi streak you're on, it was too easy.   <br />
<br />
Oh, and I have no actual complaints with dubbed other than the fact that if there was no dubbing, anime would be significantly cheaper. Seeing as how I can't hear, paying that extra three bucks for dub is insignificantly annoying.<br />
<br />
I just am hoping it's subtitled/captioned so I can actually watch the show.   Edited by: Stalkyr Weaksoul at: 4/29/04 4:34 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aurarier</div><div class="date">04-29-04, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, nice one - I try not to GN unless someone's being a dumbass. I figure correcting his/her grammar is far more demeaning than anything I could say about his/her argument.  <br />
<br />
Although if we wanted to be technical, it's not really a sentence, now is it? It's more of a hanging dependent clause.</div></div><hr />

I comprehended what was happening, but it was just so weird that I could never get into it. /Shrug, I'll take my NASA channel any day of the week thank you very much.</div></div><hr />
