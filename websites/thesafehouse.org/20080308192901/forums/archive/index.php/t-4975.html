Mercede Dominici – 50 Minstrel Palomides <br />
<br />
The intent of this document is to share insights, tactics, and strategies between a minstrel who uses the Bladerunner template and Infiltrators. The Bladerunner template is a stealth assassin style Minstrel who is designed to kill and kill quickly, simlar to the way infiltrators do. When paired with a highly skilled and experienced Infiltrator, this duo can kill any single target in the game in 4 moves.<br />
<br />
First some definitions. The Bladerunner template is as follows. Saracen Thrust start 90 dex 60 str 60 con. Skill base at 50 are 44 instruments, 34 stealth, and 35 thrust. Currently it is believed that +11 is the maximum allowable for bonuses to skills at level 50, however this has been displaying at +13 so I cannot verify the actual final modified skills on my minstrel. However, at rank three here are the displayed totals.<br />
<br />
52 instruments<br />
47 stealth<br />
42 thrust<br />
<br />
The terminology Bladerunner comes from the Ridley Scott film of the same name where the protagonist (Deckert-played by Harrison Ford) is a Bladerunner whose job it is to “retire” replicants thaqt have escaped or gone awry. As a Minstrel who attacks from stealth, our job is to also “retire” the enemy and able to move great distances extremely quickly. The named was coined by me and actually has no bearing on the remainder of this discussion other than for trivia purposes.<br />
<br />
Banzai<br />
<br />
As the name implies, the banzai is an attack with total disregard for life and limb, with the intent to do more damage to the enemy that the loss of your single life. In Dark Age of Camelot, this means to assassinate an extremely high realm point holder, notorious for hiding in packs or in groups of 8. The realm point gain by the minstrel and the infiltrator, plus the pure satisfaction of utterly ganking some overconfident @#%$ who brags about how great he is hiding amongst 8 group members is priceless. In addition to the massive gains in realm points for the two of you, this attack form is virtually unstoppable and cannot be defeated by anyone due to how quickly the kill is made.<br />
<br />
Why and when? Many people ask me why banzai? The reason is actually a simple decision based on numbers. Many members of the stealth world realize we never or rarely get rezzed. We also know that it is virtually impossible for us to stay with groups of our realm mates that seem to “spazz” around a lot and constantly move from location to location on the slightest whim. Since we are often alone, how can we profit? The answer is the banzai. Killing a single target worth a very high amount of realm points, when surrounded by multiple friends nets you often 800-1000 realm points, whereas your death is the result of 7-12 others attacking you and your realm point value is divided amongst them. In addition to this, when paired with the Bladerunner and bound in Cotswold it is a 34 second run with speed back to sauvage and back into Emain where a majority of our battles of such nature take place. Even tonight I netted over 14,480 realm points in about 2 hours dying maybe 4 times total. Pairing the banzai up with the standard “kill a lone straggler” works quite well.<br />
<br />
The Loner<br />
Many of us members of the stealth world must rely on the loners. The even con or lower by himself, which we ruthlessly attack from the shadows. This is standard practice and is to be expected. The positive result of this is that your victim alerts all of his friends so most Loner kills are followed up by a banzai. The loner kill is the first step in the 2 kill advancement of your realm point totals. In essence your kill of the loner and re-stealthing allows you to wait and observe the arrival of his unaware loved ones, usually which includes that fat realm point cow you have been waiting for.<br />
<br />
Specific Banzai Tactics by Target class.<br />
Midgard-Hibernia casters are usually our bread and butter. They stay in groups and AOE nuke often, especially in keep raids. They cannot solo very well and depend on groups for their survival. Since they are in groups, they are often buffed. This makes the solo Infiltrator’s job quite difficult. Even if you do land PA CD you will probably be stunned by the remainder of the group, the target will receive a Druid or Healer instant and your kill will be swept away from you. Here is where your teaming with the Bladerunner shines. A thrusting spec minstrel opener ranges from 600-900 damage depending on whether the target is seated or not as pictured below. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem for the minstrel is our Pierce and all other attacks will be nullified by the caster self only bladeturn. The Perforate Artery-Creeping Death-Stunning Stab chain + Poison however is not affected by this, so the minstrel+infiltrator together can easily do 1400-2000 damage in 4 moves before the remainder of the group realizes what is happeneing.<br />
<br />
The attack step by step.<br />
<br />
Minstrel should use a fast weapon, such as Rancid Black Tooth on standing casters, or a slow heavy hitter such as Powder maker (dartmoor drop) on seated casters.<br />
<br />
Infiltrator approaches caster from front, who is either standing around or casting to attack someone during a battle.<br />
<br />
Minstrel approaches the caster from behind.<br />
<br />
Infiltrator attacks FIRST with Perforate Artery and cues up Creeping Death.<br />
<br />
Minstrel Immediately opens with Pierce, Stunning Below, Major Cacophony, Discordant Shriek, and cues up Pierce (or to be conservative Puncture-Lunge)<br />
<br />
Infiltrator lands Creeping Death, however the target is already stunned from the Minstrel stunning below (6 seconds). Infiltrator continues with Stunning Stab<br />
<br />
Minstrel lands Pierce or Puncture-Lunge combo.<br />
<br />
Target dies or has already died.  If not infiltrator lands Stunning stab as Minstrel lands Lunge.<br />
<br />
At this point the target is probably dead and typing in group/alliance/chat group that “blah blah is attacking me”<br />
<br />
The infiltrator should immediately attempt to sprint away and re-stealth. The Minstrel should immediately attack the next closest target in order to buy time for the infiltrator. If enemies are not near the minstrel can attempt to sprint and restealth. However if enemies are all around it is more than likely you will both be killed. The minstrel’s job is to buy time for the infiltrator who can get away and restealth. Each and everytime the minstrel does this, it insures that the infiltrator will enjoy teaming with the minstrel. Despite this, you have accomplished your goal. A fat realm point holder is now eating Emain grass which you and the infiltrator split and even if you have died, that person will realize they are no longer safe.<br />
<br />
To make the full use of this effect, I suggest you repeat this process on the same person for hours on end. The goal is to continue to farm that person, destroy their self-esteem, lower their ego. This is most pleasurable on loud mouth casters who think they are hot @#%$ with their quickcast 9 second stuns (Hibernia enchanters) etc.<br />
<br />
lastly, I'd like to give a shout out to my brothers in shadows on Palomides<br />

<br />
I agree on your duo tactics, Inf + Minstrel. <br />
<br />
Just not sure whats unique about your &quot;Bladerunner&quot;.  Typically a new name implies a different strategy of skill points... IE. ShadowZerker, or other non-CS Assassins.<br />
<br />
Neat name, but its no different than most Minstrels out there.  Its actually the most common template around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_pitz</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why Thrust instead of Slash on the Infiltrator? I've seen a ton of posts that say Slash is the way to go- that diamond slash chain is awesome.<br />
<br />
Slash also has a bonus against leather.<br />
<br />
So a lot of people are building slash Britons.  Anyone have experience with this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
and 2 halves make....</div></div><hr />

He was saying that the lone caster is the bait.      It's the big RP running-at-the-mouth casters that come out after you kill the lone caster that he is giving strategy.   <br />

Its a guide to get that target sitting in the middle of 8 realmmates. Its not saying you make it out alive everytime. Its a guide on how to kill the target before those 8 beat you down.</div></div><hr />
