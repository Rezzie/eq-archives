I had one of the best experiences in my ENTIRE EQ career tonight!  I did the Dryad quests in Oakmyst Forest and have been trying to do the last part for 2 days now.  It's a pain in the ass towards the end cause you have to clear this cave filled with corrupted dryads and rotweeds.  They are hard as hell.<br />
<br />
Regardless. On to the story.<br />
<br />
I ended up grouping with a lvl 15 druid; she agreed to help me if I helped her finish another quest.  Agreeing peaceably, we did her quest (kill four Oakmyst bears) and then proceeded to the tear-drop cave.  We cleared it of the dryads, but mid-way during the rotweed fight, she froze up and we both died. <br />
<br />
No problem, she says, we can just go back and get them now that I know what's up.<br />
<br />
Ok, I agree and we go back for our shards.  Once there, we again clear out the dryads and while we're doing it, this group shoots in and proceeds to try and kill the rotweeds.  Well, they aren't too successful and go running out.  I manage to snag the last two and start slicing and dicing the best way I know how.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we were too close to a guard and he killed them.  Ok, it's a fairly rapid pop, so we head back to the cave.  Again, we clear the cave and then start in on the weeds.  I pull one out of the cave to avoid lag and start working; the group from before comes up from behind and then tries to take the remaining two.  One guy dies and AGAIN the others go running.<br />
<br />
Determined now, I kill the one I have and shoot the trailers.  They pause, turn around, decide I'm a bigger threat, and come back.  So, here I am on this cliff, taking on two huge weeds, and then BAM! I'm falling backwards off the cliff, still fighting, and manage to kill the second one.  The third one turns tail like a little bitch and so I pull out Gregor's trusty bow and start shooting him. <br />
<br />
I LOVE this thing...rapid refire, smooth handling...running all over the forest taking potshots...watching people's reactions as we race by.  Over the bridge, off a hill, under the falls ... oh man...it was HEAVEN.  There are gods!<br />
<br />
Man, my heart is still racing and my hands are shaky.<br />
<br />
No, I didn't end up killing it as it suddenly disappeared, but yes I did manage to finish the quest.  The gloves I got were pretty kick ass, but I gave them to the druid for helping me out.  I wouldn't be able to wear them for awhile and I was just thankful to have the stupid quest over.  She had worse gear then I did and stayed an extra hour helping me out.</div></div><hr />
