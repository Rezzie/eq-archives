No penalty for dying, no gain for killing, you can't loot or be looted.  You cannot even kill people in their homeland.<br />

I wish they would have a real PVP server  :|</div></div><hr />

Sure you can, play on a PvP Server maybe ?!<br />
But rewards for open PvP Servers and all zones without battlezones will be implemented as soon as the battlezones are going live.</div></div><hr />

I Dont play on a pvp server,  Sure I like to pvp on occasion but not all the time.  Expecially when im young.<br />
Make a new character, walk out into newbie lands, attack your first wolf and get ganked by some bored 60th level who has nothing better to do then kill first level newbies over and over until they have no purpose other than to spawn and their corpse and get one-shot-killed again.</div></div><hr />

Just read they were adding a pvp reward system, yay  :D</div></div><hr />

I play on a pvp server and have never had that happen to me.  In fact I dont even hear about people corpse camping for longer than 2-3 kills before they get bored and move on.  On average I probobly have 1 pvp encounter for every 5-6 hours in game, as long as Im not actively hunting for it.... The pvp scene really isnt that bad.</div></div><hr />

Bah! Ye can't be killed in yer own homelands unless flagged fer PvP and only an idjit would do that while enemies are around.</div></div><hr />

Regardless.<br />

<br />
You absolutely can. A rogue who is actually careful and sneaky can get into a ton of places where people are able to, but not expecting to be killed. People zoning into safe zones from either running through, or flying in are readily available. If you're complaining that you don't get to kill any ol' lvl 3 while they're unsuspectingly killing wolves and meeting their trainer for the first time, oh well, I'm not sure what to tell you. If you're complaining that you can't kill people closer to your level in these zones, you're not trying. It's more than possible. People come into safe areas still flagged all the time, places it's no problem for a rogue to sneak into and kill them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything else is above board on a PvP server, with that one single exception. What's the fun of taking stuff away in a game where material items such as weapons and armor get changed so quickly that anything you have on has zero value within a couple levels other than to grief?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrkskog</div><div class="date">01-15-05, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly assassinating people in their own town and such.  Level limit is fine, but the not being able to attack them unless they're flagged is what I don't like.</div></div><hr />

gnomergon is alliance, you dont see us whining about that.</div></div><hr />

we usually let you guys live in SM hallway, you guys give us nothing in Gnomeregan  :angry</div></div><hr />

So you guys are better off not coming.  The atmosphere isn't very interesting and it's a pretty big instance with weird aggro on the ramps.  I found SM to be much funner.<br />

A bit off topic.  Whats the trick to resetting instances now?  2 man teams don't work.</div></div><hr />

Two man teams works just fine if you do it right. You form the group, you disband AFTER you exit the instance, you reinvite the other person. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />
