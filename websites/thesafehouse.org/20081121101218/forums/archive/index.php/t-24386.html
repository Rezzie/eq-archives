<br />
ALSO keeping with tradition: Rags watch says it's the 18th, and his brain says its the 15th. But we all know as soon will he, that we meet on the 15th+1.<br />
<br />
Once again I will run in and out of the dungeon in an attempt to let everyone catch up. I think we should all do this once we reach level six, as long as jaes and others are catching up.<br />
<br />
Gona do alot of my work today so I don't have anything to worry about tomarro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, well everything is going as planned for me, just going to work on stuff until its time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What time are we meeting tonight folks?<br />
<br />
I just landed a +1 con tome on my rogue, so I am a very happy camper</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now! As in 8 P.M. EST!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where is the rags and the jaeses? I just saw them, they are supposed to be here with the eve and me. *looks around* :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">05-16-06, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, was finishing up and submitting an article.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All in all I think we did pretty damn good, I think that next saturday we should do STK on hard again. Thus getting troz to level six more than likely. Then I say we do Dalera's Tomb, I mean really, our weaponry is pretty damn good.. +2 Holy, +4, Shocky Puregoodiness. I more than think we could do dalera's tomb, we're not a normal group, with us there is more than meets the eye. Now! I command troz to transform into a moped and prove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No go on the moped.  But maybe a golf car!  But Yeah, Delera's FTW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I was just talking with someone about something. If rules in ddo don't stray too far from dnd, then Eve should have no problem wearing regular old full plate. <br />
Think about it, he ONLY uses devine spells and those don't require any concentration because no somatic component, then all he does is uses wands... well those shouldn't require any somatic component/concentration at all really. Mostly just point and &quot;everett: bang!&quot; Maybe I'm missing something but I think we need to get the healer some +3,4,5 Full Plate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bards get arcane penalties from divine spells wearing full plate, that's just bardic stuff.<br />
<br />
Light armor yields no penalties what so ever.<br />
<br />
Also, jolt sucks at undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Undead love Jolt tho.  :rip</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-18-06, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was definitely failing Cure Light Wounds back before I got the mithril shield.  All my spells are arcane, it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sillis</div><div class="date">05-18-06, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Bard spells are considered &quot;arcane&quot; even though some of them are from the Cleric list.  As mentioned, light armor has a 0% spell failure chance for bards.  Shields still can also cause failure, but as Yalum noted, mithril has a lower spell failure chance.<br />
<br />
I do not think the game is complex enough right now to check whether there is a somatic component to a spell or not to apply the armor failure chance.  Hell, they can't even program the fact that halflings should not be able to use longbows without major penalties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-18-06, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The somatic check works, the spell descriptions would point out my 5% fail rate on CLW (Verbal, Somatic) but not Otto's (Verbal).</div></div><hr />
