<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-29-04, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you need some extra money early on in the game I recommend doing some wholesaler tasks for whatever tradeskill organization you joined.  Make sure you raise your tradeskill harvesting abilities on the Island of Refuge (much much easier to do there) and once they are above 40 you will be able to harvest resources in Antonica and the Commonlands.<br />
<br />
The wholesaler will typically ask you to harvest 15 of a resource, and give you 12 silver for each quest (you can do them indefinately).  In addition, most of the tier 2 resources are in high demand and will sell very quickly for 50 to 20 copper a piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coyoteblack</div><div class="date">11-30-04, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also if you already have 15 iron on you and are asked to het 15 iron have some one hand them to you one by one and you willl quest credit.<br />
<br />
not sure if it is fair but  I like to buy a stack of zsstuff (like iron) for 5 silver do the quest and make a 7 silver profit and keep the extra 5 product.</div></div><hr />

Did that make sense to anyone?<br />
<br />
Anyways... I already got voted off the newbie island, are there any good places to skill up gathering around Freeport?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkefang</div><div class="date">12-01-04, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Freeport stinks for gathering.  All the Tier 1 zones are full of highly aggressive mobs and trains from dumbasses, so it can be difficult to gather until you get high enough to grey the agressive mobs out, or join up with a group that'll protect you while you gather.  The Graveyard is probably the easiest zone to gather in, since the front of that zone is kind of a low level, and the undead have a very small aggro radius. <br />
<br />
Qeynos, on the other hand, has 3 zones, Oakmyst, the Bog and the Ruins, where gathering is fairly easy.  The aggressive mobs are easily avoided, and the only problem is competition from other players.  The Caves aren't really even a bad zone to gather in, as the pit area and the front of the ramp area have few aggressive mobs, and quite a few nodes to gather from.</div></div><hr />

You could just ask me to clarify instead of being insulting!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Any way wholesaler quest asks you to harvest 15 of &quot;what ever&quot;<br />
say you have 15 &quot;what ever&quot; on you, instead of harvesting 15 again have someone hand them back to you one at a time this will count as quest completion and whamo 12 silver.<br />
<br />
Also allot of the time you can buy a stack for 5 silver so you can make 7 SP profit..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">12-06-04, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its much easier to do these things than ever before since they lowered the skill requirement to gather in Antonica and Commonlands to around 20ish. Since you're still harvesting Tier 2 items, you skill up incredibly fast out there. <br />
<br />
I got my fishing from around 15 to 101 in less than an hour of swiming the moat around the Keep of the Gnollslayers in Antonica. Not bad at all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even better, once your harvesting skills are high enough you can take on tier 3 wholesaler tasks (Thundering Steppe and Nektulos) and make 48 silver per task (task always involves collecting 15 of a resource).  You can also sell them on the market for 2-5 silver a piece at times, though I always give them to guild crafters.<br />
<br />
And if you are going to harvest, know the rares!  If you are lucky enough to harvest a rare resource you are sitting on a goldmine.</div></div><hr />
