anyone help with this plz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lomack</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you done VZ yet?<br />
<br />
You have the TZ flag message, but I don't see the VZ flag message in there.  Which looks exactly the same except replace TZ's name with VZ's name.<br />
<br />
Also with Tylis not knowing who you are.  I believe thats something to do with the preflags in all of the sick people area.  Which would jive with the not being able to recall the defeat of Saryn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess would be you need to kill Bert. Falging sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_eqsunil</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need Bertoxx (maybe Carprin) and VZ to get into Sol Ro and PoE/W/A. (and a couple trips to the sick bay, the seer and the librarian in there)<br />
<br />
Then Jiva and Protector of Dresolik will get you into Sol Ro's room and killing him will get you into PoFire.</div></div><hr />
