[Sun Oct 26 09:40:45 2003] Learning of Zebuxoruk's fate, the only way to save him is gather materials that will allow you to power up the machine to send you into the Plane of Time. Maelin has charged you with finding an elemental power source sufficient to activate Meldrath's time machine.<br />

<br />
That line includes them and, actually, indicates that he should have access to Earth, Air and Water.<br />
<br />
Guess that's why I'm confused by this thread, everything points to him having access to everything in PoP except the PoI factory and PoTime (and PoEB, but that's a /key).</div></div><hr />

All she needed to do was go back to the gnome in the library and do the 'I have new lore' line to get into Earth/Air/Water.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both those seem to help people get flags straightened out.<br />
<br />
Once I had all my flags done, it took me at least 4 trips up and down that dang elevator, running between the two of them before I got all the stuff worked out.</div></div><hr />
