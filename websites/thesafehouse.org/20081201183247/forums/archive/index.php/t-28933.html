<br />
I have been using a crossbow since day one and my highest crit damage with it was around 300ish, which to me seems good.  I was even in a fight with a Psi, who told me he was very surprised that I did any damage at all with ranged because of his previous experience with other rogues.<br />
<br />
Should I stick with the crossbow, or go with thrown daggers?  What have you guys done and why?<br />

Then I found Arc of Daggers and switched to thrown, but have only used the ability two or three times.<br />
I'm kind of thinking that the darts and such for poisons later will  use thrown so I decided to go with it anyway.  <br />
<br />
Overall I dont &quot;range&quot; much other than to practice skill.  Combine that I do more damage in melee to only being able to carry 200 daggers without taking up pack space and I advance on the mob instead of stopping to throw something at him.</div></div><hr />

So far, I'm still using a crossbow, I can do 100 to 200 damage on average from range and have crit'd for 400.  I was thinking of getting up my skill in thrown, but right now I'm also thinking bad thoughts about being a rogue.  Frustration has really set in and I'm wondering if it's really worth it to continue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wait it out Rogues will have their due and when it comes it will be good:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LadySalba</div><div class="date">03-16-07, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually prefer the bow myself, only because it's so efficient to carry the arrows around in the quiver. Perhaps if there were a better way to carry extensive amounts of thrown daggers around I'd switch to that exclusively.</div></div><hr />

As of today, I have gotten my throwing skill up to a par with ranged weapon skill... I'm not going to be scientific, or use a parser because well, I don't know how.  I'll get one stack of arrows and daggers of equivalent level and will fight the same mobs... then I'll try to tally up damage using those weapons and I'll post the results here... Might take a few days because of work, but I'm interested to see if xbow damage is a lot higher than thrown weapon.</div></div><hr />

Crude Throwing Dagger and Weighted Throwing Dagger = Same damage.</div></div><hr />

Xbox hits harder than daggers. I'd think that they'd fix something so that only we could throw daggers harder for more damage or something. Maybe even a duo dagger toss would be awesome. As of now, there's no real reason to use thrown daggers. Honestly, i switched to Bow &amp; Arrow cause it hit harder and faster. The animation is easier to guage to to keep a steady pace. The range is also further, so you can back off when soloing further than the Xbow, so you get more hits in before mob makes it to you and you Knee Break it again. :)</div></div><hr />
