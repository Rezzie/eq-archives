<br />
Tales from Earthsea, the latest feature film from Studio Ghibli, directed by Goro Miyazaki, Hayao Miyazaki's son, took home the dubious Worst Director and Worst Film honors (http://hogacentral.blogs.com/hoganews/2007/01/bunshun_raspber.html) at the Japanese Bunshun Raspberry Awards. <br />
<br />
The &quot;awards&quot; are voted on by 32 Japanese movie critics, a group that had no particular affection for the younger Miyazaki's work when it was released there in July.<br />
<br />
I wonder if it was just bad, or book to film bad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-22-07, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Goro Miyazaki is an spoiled moron who thinks he can make Studio Ghibli quality films just because he is Hayao Miyazaki's son. With little to no creditentals to back him up other than being the son of a genius storyteller. There are far more qualified and far more experienced people to make Ghibli films.</div></div><hr />
