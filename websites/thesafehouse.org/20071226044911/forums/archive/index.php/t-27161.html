<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">12-10-06, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's kind of difficult to pick a favourite first episode, as I approach all first episodes as a way to introduce the main characters, introduce the graphic style of the anime, and either create mystery or create something that must be overcome by the end of the series.<br />
<br />
Haibane Renmei had a good first episode in the aspect of character introductions, Lain was good in showing its unique graphical style and creating mystery, Elfen Lied had an impressive first scene with Lucy's escape, and then there's something like Berserk which has a battlehardened warrior battling evil, but the rest of the series flashes back to a previous time in his life that turned him onto that path.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">04-06-07, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honey &amp; Clover also had a very good 1st episode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">04-06-07, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Giant Robo may be my favorite first episode, though I'm not sure if an OVA should even go into the discussion.<br />
<br />
Samurai Champloo had an awesome first episode, and then I lost interest...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-08-07, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe Berserk because the first episode takes place at some point after the series ends, and that part of the story is better than any that was actually contained in the show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kenshin and Full Metal Panic also both had good first eps.</div></div><hr />

There are too many shows that hooked me from the get-go for various reasons. I can't even begin to name them all.</div></div><hr />
