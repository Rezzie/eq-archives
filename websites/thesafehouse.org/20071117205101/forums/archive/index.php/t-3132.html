<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">11-18-03, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my group split up a few years ago when a couple of the people moved away for military and stuff. then back in september I started again with one of the guys and a bunch of his friends (most of whom I didn't really care for). <br />
<br />
and after four fairly enjoyable but way too late sessions of shadowrun, the group fell apart again because of personal @#%$. nobody really liked/likes my friend's gf, because even though she's a gamer she's a huge attention whore and is constantly disrupting other players and the GM during gaming. plus, the house is a huge mess and there's no real room for gaming, especially if we start early enough and the kids are running and crawling around.<br />
<br />
so the other guys started playing at someone else's house, invited me, but I really didn't want to get in the middle of this stupid little feud between them and my friend.<br />
<br />
so yeah, it sucks not having a group, but it sucks even worse having a group that playing with will cause problems :P</div></div><hr />

AIM has a dice bot that works reasonably well, and OpenRPG (I think) actually lets DMs upload maps and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Barrister</div><div class="date">11-18-03, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup, not having a rl group bites. bit i suggest OpenRPG, if you have a group whi just isnt physically close. Play with my friends every weekend, and dont think anyone lives in the same country.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">11-18-03, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">never liked playing online. tried to get into it few years ago when we first started splitting up but just couldn't. <br />
<br />
I really don't have the interest anymore, I guess. part of the fun in gaming for me was with the specific friends I played with; I've never had as much fun with other groups that I tried.</div></div><hr />

Its indeed sad - they actually have had my character along as an NPC since I left, and just recently killed him off...... so sad.</div></div><hr />

If you play DnD just as a hack and slash then yes.  If you play to build / be part of an evolving story, interact deeper than just the damage your dagger does and so on and actually role-play instead of &quot;be yourself&quot; in cool armor, weapons and slaying fantastic beasts then it's nowhere the same.</div></div><hr />
