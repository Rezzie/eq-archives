[spoil:4f5b55589a]This portrayal of SONY'S new game Everquest 2,  pits Vox, the cursed dragon versus Lucan.  The structure in the middle is the stone sword standing at the entrance to THE CITADEL[/spoil:4f5b55589a]</div></div><hr />

While I've never particularily liked the Iksar race, they look pretty good:<br />

As for other models, I'll have a hard time taking the game seriously unless they improve the skin tone.  Current skins make the toons looks like they're made of plastic or something.  creepy x 3.<br />
<br />
Yah, I'm shallow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.thesafehouse.org/users/ruccus/EQ2/frapsvsprintscreen.JPG<br />
<br />
See how washed out and dull the left image is?  The characters really do look good in the character creation utility.  I think EQ2 might just have a problem with some capture utilities (I've always thought the screenshots don't do the characters justice).</div></div><hr />

Not too mention Vox looks like a Snake with Wings rather than a dragon.  I always pictured dragons as immense beasts.</div></div><hr />

I have some screen shots somewhere of fighting Vox ...  I vaguely remember her butt looking a bit bigger.  Maybe she's going for a modeling contract?  Going to pose for Play Dragon?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So to see Vox smallish, doesn't bother me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[have to admit, although i have 700+ levels in EQ i never bothered to have a look at Vox. By the time i heard of a well known rogue that used to pickpocket Lady Vox and so earn his university scholarship on eBay - after which SoE/Verant made magical items non-pickpocketable, it somehow lost its lure to go there...]</div></div><hr />

<br />
eah ? as i remmber that it was shown to SOE/Verant and that they changed it fast , i never heard / read that he sold pickpoket from vox on e-bay<br />
<br />
and if i'm not mistaken , he was the first to get ragebringer and had a full suit of warrior planer armor before they added rogue planer armor</div></div><hr />
