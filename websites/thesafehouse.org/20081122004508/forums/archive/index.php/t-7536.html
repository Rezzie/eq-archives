Anyone suggest an all dwarf guild out there, on any of the 3 PvP servers that might be similar?<br />

Not just all Dwarf, but someone you would respect as well. (Either respect as good allies, or good opponents.)    Drunken Bandits,  Bristlebane<br />

I'm not a huge PvP fan, but I may be willing to give it a shot as a change of pace. I know on the Zeks, Guild membership can be a big deal at times. Not so much for twinking, or any crap like that, but more as a big brother you can run to when someone 4 levels higher decides to make you a target.<br />

They're not all dwarves, but they are all shortie (Gnomes, Dwarves and Halfling- Team Server), but mostly dwarves.  One the oldest guilds on the server, lost of people, also very lacking in rules and honor as of late.  There's still some good people in the guild though. [b]Ceescrit Bossalini<br />

LotU is a 1 team PK guild, one of my most respected opponents.  alwys honorable.  15-35 in level.  but they are raiseing their top cap.<br />
<br />
AoK is more of just a one team guild.  they dont PK lights, just darks, i would say they are much higher level, but ive seen them as low as 16.<br />

We have the Shanks for blue, and Ceescrit has done a good job wrassling the pointy eared deviants into a cohesive mob, and I see quite a few evil team posters, but very few safehouser shorties.  Considering how many highly skilled dorfs, gnomes, and halfers we have, it would be a epic thing to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read posts from their members on the vault boards you'll see they are dedicated to PvP through and through.  I like obessesion in a player, gives them a willingness to cut through the excuses and just kill you.</div></div><hr />

But the Hammer of Brell guys are sure funny, whenever they enter a zone they go off for about five minutes with, &quot;For Brell!&quot; and &quot;Steins high!&quot; and things like that. Those aren't exact quotes but basically they like to shout about beer and brell.</div></div><hr />
