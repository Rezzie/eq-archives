<br />
Disappointing to hear initially, but I'm sure most people would wather wait for it to come out to be disappointed/impressed with it, given the generally highly postive history of Studio Ghibli.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerda Jurtafryde</div><div class="date">07-29-06, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, after that horrific SciFi mini I was really looking forward to this.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SnibbsQ</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How can you take a great animation studio, give them a great story, and they turn it into crap? I'm just going to believe that the critics are retarded, because they usually are and nothing else makes sense. It'd be like 2+2=0 suddenly, my brain just cant comprehend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanzein</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wasn't this the director's first movie? That might explain it. I'm gonna reserve my personal opinion until I see it first hand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since when have critic reviews ever been right, though? Especially towards a niche market like anime? :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerda Jurtafryde</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Studio Ghibli usually does well with the critics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Ghibli nearly always does incredible at critics. There are some factors to consider here - Miyazaki went through a long learning, working his way up, to become a incredible director. Goro Miyazaki, on the other hand, is only the son of Hayao Miyazaki. He has little experience, and none as a director. This was the equicvalent of giving Joe Schmuck a multimillion dollar budget to make an animation under the label of the most belovred studio of all time.<br />
<br />
Him being Hayao's son does not make him special in any way, further compounded by the fact he hates his father, and therefore likely has little to no influence by him.<br />
<br />
So yeah, unfortunately this film was all but fated to suck, I'm sorry to say. I, too, reserve my judgement, but the critics are likely right in this case, all signs point to that.<br />
<br />
Also, while they got a great story7 one must remember the anime is not 100% true to the story, as most ghibli fils are. So he had to add his directors touch to the story, a touch that was given no time to plish itself working its way up the ladder of respect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">07-31-06, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe I know Studio Ghibli does well, my comment was made completely tongue-in-cheek (heck, Spirited Away got like what, a 97% on RottenTomatoes?). :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">08-01-06, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the critics might not have liked it, this weekend it ousted Pirates of the Caribbean from top spot in Japan (even thought PotC2 was playing on 750 screens while Gedo Senki was playing on 435 screens).<br />
<br />
Gedo Senki brought in 905 million yen over the weekend (just under $7.9 million usd).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">08-01-06, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not much of a suprise though- in the case of a Studio Ghibli film, I'd take more stock into the following weekend and two's earnings than the first weekend's, to allow word of mouth to spread about whether it was worth watching or not.<br />
<br />
People see Ghibli's name and automatically take themselves and their children there, regardless of critics.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Not that I mean you imply otherwise, Ruccus, just commenting on it.</div></div><hr />
