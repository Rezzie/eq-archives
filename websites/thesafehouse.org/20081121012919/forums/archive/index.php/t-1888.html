<br />
Well, except that then perversely you attract a certain type of women then.<br />
<br />
Yes, there are some that would rather hook up with a married man than a single one. I'm sure there's some deep seated psychological reason, like proof the man is more stable or soemthing, but it weirds me out anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xanyia</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe some girls that pursue married men do it because they have a problem with any kind of commitment and love to have a foolproof excuse to dump the guy when they get bored. <br />
<br />
It probably also is a huge ego booster for others, I am sure the girl who was living on the other coast who made my husband leave me (and is moving him with him after exactly four weeks since he left me) thinks she's really cool.<br />
<br />
As for me, I am still wearing my wedding ring until my divorce will be final, I really didn't welcome guys hitting on me while I was with my husband and do even less now.<br />

Do two rings mean the ring on the ring finger is not a wedding ring?  And this was a British girl.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry theres about a thousand steps.  And you'll never complete them.<br />
<br />
I think i'm at step 25 entitled: That time of month, again.  And it repeats every couple of steps for a long while.<br />

I was on the scene for quite a while and gotten to know many of the girls who are into that music and lifestyle. A LOT of them tend to be emotionally disturbed. Specifically depression is the main problem. Now they aren't ALL like that but a lot of them. Main reason even when I was big into the scene I always was dating some preppy girl who didn't go to shows and all. Is she true punk or emo kinda punk?</div></div><hr />

My guess is emo since &quot;true&quot; punk died in about 1979.  <br />

Cant they ask the women in their lives? These all seems like super simple problems or complaints, its usually a question of either<br />
<br />
A) asking the girl directly about something<br />
B) getting the cajones to ask her out<br />
or<br />
C) letting the hell go of her<br />
<br />
from what Ive seen on the SH, and Ive been posting here for three years, 90% of the girl questions can be resolved with one of the above three things.<br />
<br />
Whats so freaking mysterious about women that we cant figure out on our own, or with the help of females we know personally? Why put it on a message board for the people to either give painfully earnest but bad advice, or make fun of you in an oblique enough way that  they dont get edited?</div></div><hr />
