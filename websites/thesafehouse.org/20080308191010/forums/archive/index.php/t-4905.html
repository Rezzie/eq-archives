<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tiranic</div><div class="date">02-20-02, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a lvl 12 Nightshade with 10 dex, 10 quickness, 5/5 str/constitution<br />
<br />
So far I have<br />
9 Stealth<br />
10 Crit Strike<br />
<br />
And the bit i'm worried about<br />
<br />
8 Cletic Duel...<br />
<br />
Should I have put the cletic duel points in piercing or not?<br />
<br />
Oh, and with the new patch will I be given those spec points I missed or not?</div></div><hr />

Are you gimped for life by specing in Celtic Dual, hardly. I would definetly stop specing in anything else until you get some weapon skill (Either piercing or blades) to bring up your damage variance, but celtic dual has some nice styles at lower levels. 		-Miron Quickblade, searching...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Winin</div><div class="date">02-20-02, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the celtic dual styles make both weapons hit, I'm thinking I should get the first one at least so I can make sure both poisons go off early in the battle? Or does it not work that way? I'm level 10 now with no CD skill. I guess I can just splurge for the first style and test it out.<br />

<br />
oh yah. raise your weap skill to 1/2 or 2/3 of your level soon as you can, it will help you a lot. i wouldn't raise celtic dual again until you do that.<br />
