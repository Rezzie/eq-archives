<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dulben</div><div class="date">11-12-04, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I started the Sethir the Ancient rogue quest. The reward is a fairly nice blade (which I need).<br />
<br />
The problem is, I can't seem to figure out how to get near Sethir without him seeing me. I died like 10 times last night trying different scenarios. I watched another level 11 rogue pull him and than kill him without his &quot;minions&quot; jumping in. I tried it and got royal smacked.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me a hint please? The one time I tried PP it did nothing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">11-12-04, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">been awile since i did the ne rogue quest,about 3 months but ill give it a try.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sether walks out on his branch,basically between point A and point B.<br />
<br />
point A is facing into the landmass,near the edge of the world. Point B is facing away from the landmass out on his tree.<br />
<br />
what you need to do is wait for him to reach point B,with his back turned on you. At that point,you can sneak up on him&amp;lt;stealthed&gt; and pickpocket the item. once that is done,you should sprint and run for your life.<br />
<br />
You can also sneak up on him and try to kill him,but he spawns extra mobs,so its tougher to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: found him by accident while fighting something else, and died to him and his minions.  went back, pick pocketed, moved to a side branch, hearthstoned back to Darnassus, np.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Aidden for the tip on when to try the pickpocket.  I just waited till he started his walk back out the limb and when he stopped I grabbed it.</div></div><hr />
