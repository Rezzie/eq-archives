<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">04-18-06, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Figured I'd just put them all in the same place... my 3 characters I am working on currently.<br />
<br />
Attack Rogue (High Dex, moderate everything else).<br />
<br />
Level 8 rogue, level 2 fighter<br />
<br />
Level 1 Rogue: Two Weapon Fighting<br />
Level 2 Rogue:<br />
Level 3 Rogue: Weapon Finess<br />
Level 4 Rogue:<br />
Level 5 Rogue:<br />
Level 6 Rogue: Toughness (or, another attack feat)<br />
Level 7 Rogue:<br />
Level 8 Rogue:<br />
Level 9 Fighter: Weapon Focus Piercing/Toughness<br />
I AM HERE<br />
Level 10 Fighter: Improved Critical Piercing<br />
<br />
Dual Wield burst rapiers, or stat damage rapiers for maximum effect, can also put a short sword in offhand and get the benifits.<br />
<br />
CURRENT AC: 37!<br />
+5 padded, +5 light shield, +4 bracers from Deleras, +8 from dex, +1 from size, +2 from defensive...<br />
<br />
Archer Build (High Str/Dex)<br />
<br />
Level 1 Ranger: Point Blank Shot, Bow Strength, Favored Enemy: (Giants or Undead)<br />
Level 2 Ranger: Rapid Fire<br />
Level 3 Fighter: Dodge, Mobility<br />
Level 4 Fighter: Shot on the Run<br />
Level 5 Fighter:<br />
Level 6 Fighter: Manyshot, Weapon Focus Ranged<br />
Level 7 Fighter:<br />
Level 8 Fighter: Improved Critical Ranged<br />
Level 9 Fighter: Weapon Specialization Ranged<br />
Level 10 Fighter: Greater Weapon Focus Ranged<br />
I AM HERE! LEVEL 10!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Rangertank Build (experimental) (DWARF) (High Str/Con, low dex, CN or CG!)<br />
<br />
Level 1 Ranger: Favored Enemy Giants, Shield Expertise<br />
Level 2 Fighter: Heavy Armor Proficency, Tower Shield Proficency, Weapon Focus: Slashing<br />
Level 3 Ranger: Two Weapon Fighting, Toughness<br />
Level 4 Ranger:<br />
I am here!<br />
Level 5 Ranger:<br />
Level 6 Ranger: Favored Enemy: (Evil outsiders, Dragons, Undead, whatever.) FEAT<br />
Level 7 Ranger: Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br />
Level 8 Ranger:<br />
Level 9 Ranger: FEAT<br />
Level 10 Ranger: Evasion<br />
<br />
Idea with the last one is he can use the bracers from delara, bark skin, and full plate... gives him +5 from barkskin +4 from bracers +ac from the full plate +ac from shield, +ac vs favored enemies from his enhancements, +ac vs giants because he's a dwarf.... but he can also bust out two giant stalker knifes and go to town, or use a dwarven axe/sickle/kukri combo and slash it up that way too... very dynamic mele build.<br />
<br />
NO clue where I am going as far as feats on this guy, we will see I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">04-18-06, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me say your ranger build is working out brilliantly, there are a couple of flaws now which I will list in the below list.<br />
<br />
1. A certain lack of play time, since we have had little time free, and I don't want to get ahead of you's guys.<br />
2. People showing up at peoples houses and keeping people from playing, which adds to flaw one.<br />
3. See rules one, two, and then three again in that order, rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
:b</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got him a DEATHBLOCK robe of SPEARBLOCK :love:love:love for level 10, so happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">04-19-06, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got Kalar (the rangertank) two giantstalkers knifes, but ferrick is having a go with them until he's big enough to use them... Kalar is going to be the ultimate giantkiller.</div></div><hr />
