<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">11-26-02, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you all gasp, let's just say that I've been around D&amp;amp;D games and other pen and paper rpgs but I was never invited to &quot;join those reindeer games&quot;.<br />
<br />
So when I was invited to the Parkinsons while Shadowcross was still in the States, I gladly jumped at the chance to play with Glip, Shadowcross, Zato, Ester (formerly the Tester), Zach Parkinson, and Wotan (SH poster aka Findahl).<br />
<br />
All I can say is: NOW I get it, hehe. I kept thinking, &quot;ah this is where EQ got this from&quot; etc.  The atmosphere of the game was fun too. Great minatures, a large grid map for play and plotting. And, while the Parkinson's had just recently acquired the house and thus there wasn't any original D&amp;amp;D artwork up, I did spot an original oil later on in the family room. What really made the game of course was Keith's great imagination. During our game (2nd edition) we had shadowy thieves, orcs, drums of doom, giant spiders, water pits, and of course.... the giant slugs. Unfortunately we didn't get to finish the game because Shadowcross needed to get to the airport.<br />
<br />
It was still a blast though and I look forward to my next game. Maybe I won't be a pre-made 8' 6&quot; half ogre female in it either  <br />
<br />
P.S. Oh, and for those who went: here's the t-shirt idea I had said I was going to make  <br />

LOL around 5 hours into it or so I got reduced to -6hps, and since I was just brand new level 1, I told people not to stabilze me if it meant someone else getting killed, and just went to bed.  It was around 1:30am then.  When I got a copy of the log, I saw that it had ended up going until after 3am.<br />

<br />
Haven't played D&amp;amp;D in a long time...   <br />
<br />
Best place ever was freshman year in college in a student rec hall, which was basically a VERY big and very old Victorian-style home. The room we played was once a dining room of sorts i would guess, sort of narrow but long. The outside wall was mostly windows that  overlooked a big grassy yard that ran on a decline down to a lake. There was a fireplace in the room (working) and antique style, dimmable (a word?) lamps on the walls. There was a massive old banquet table in there too and it was perfect. <br />
<br />
Best time was a winter night w/fireplace going and snow falling outside...  *sigh* Remmi (ornery dwarven rogue and thwapper of idjits!)<br />

I've not had a chance to game in a place like that...<br />
Though I do have snow at the moment.<br />
<br />
Where in the world was your college... or should I say, where did you go to college that had an old Victorian house as a student rec hall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remmi</div><div class="date">12-05-02, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, winter and snow always gives me the D&amp;amp;D blues or, should I say, &quot;chills&quot;. I miss it so! *Remmi scowls*<br />
<br />
The school was Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, New Hampshire. More of a college &quot;prep&quot; school really for high school screw-ups and ornery young dwarfs!! In fact, like the majority of FPC students, I transferred after my freshman year and my D&amp;amp;D'ing was NEVER the same (at University of Rhode Island--rated then in the top 10 party schools..doh!).  <br />
<br />
Anyway, the old Victorian was indeed once a home and was rumored to have tunnels built beneath it than ran to down close to the lake, apparently used as a hideout for escaped slaves seeking refuge before/during the Civil war. It was also reportedly a whorehouse at one time owned by gangstas, er, gangsters.  <br />
<br />
The entire place was said to be haunted as well and a popular &quot;hazing&quot; ritual was to stay overnight in the old house and play Ouija and talk to the ghosts of a whore and her murderer, one of her bosses. She was known as the Lady of the Lake because it was said she sometimes could be seen standing near the edge of the lake... creepy. <br />
<br />
There was apparently a couple of student suicides in the 60's as a result of one of these sleepovers... <br />
<br />
Anyway, it was quite a perfect place for D&amp;amp;D.</div></div><hr />

Well ok, now that I know you never finish a PnP game I don't feel so bad. Still I'd like to get me hands on that little whatever that took the parchment from me while I could do nothing (I had flashbacks of being rooted on Vallon Zek).<br />
<br />
Kehvrynne thanks for the compliment on the shirt  <br />
<br />
Tel: Are you in Sims Online Beta then? Or did I miss the launch somehow?<br />
<br />
Remmi: That does indeed sound like a fun place to play! I've always liked &quot;hidden&quot; tunnels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">12-09-02, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the beta.  According to what I've seen it launches on the 17th.<br />
<br />
D&amp;D: We played on Friday night. My group consists of 5 players (not including the GM) and we all have 5th level characters.  The GM through 6 Umber Hulks, 3 Drow Priestesses, two Drow Archers and a human assassin at us in a set trap.  Needless to say, I ran like a schoolgirl.<br />
<br />
Right into the Blade Barrier.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
I wonder what we did to piss off the GM?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">12-09-02, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish our GM would try to kill us more often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh wait, he does both</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">12-20-02, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thats a lot to throw at 5th lvls.  I never kill a player so bluntly, unless they have really done something wrong, or been a ass to the party.  I'm a firm believe in the &quot;screen of oscurement&quot; so that I can fudge rolls to keep people alive when I roll hot.<br />
<br />
  Best rolling I ever saw was a cleric friend who rolled 3 20's and a pair of 19s with a sling.</div></div><hr />
