Fed up with having nothing to do on those rare nights off? Want to participate in more than just soloing for those new uncommon pantaloons?<br />

Then look no further! Arx Deus is now recruiting active players over level 30! We may accept recruits who are over level 25 if we are conviced you will reach 30 within a couple weeks however, so don't be scared to add a application if your curious! <br />

Heres a bit more about us;<br />
We are a casual-style guild<br />
We plan to morph into a casual-raiding style guild when the content is added<br />
We DO NOT require taxes<br />
We have meetings every Sunday night to discuss new guild policies and ideas (open to all members)<br />
We are fairly new<br />
We have events once or twice a month designed purely for fun or upgrades for everyone involved<br />
We use ventrilo and it is required in order to complete recruitment.<br />
We have a website (http://arxdeus.guildportal.com)<br />
We do not require attendance to any event or raid unless you agree to sign-up before hand<br />
We are most active between the hours of 7pm-2am EST.<br />
