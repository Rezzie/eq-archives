<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maxi Nikie</div><div class="date">03-06-03, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few days ago, while banking in neriak, I stumbled upon a few new npc's, one of which that was Fleshweaver T`Soma.  He is located near PoD in neriak b. Once hailed, he hands you a bag, and asks you to place 3 luggald flesh's into it, so they do not decay.  Luggald flesh drops off the luggalds in Dulak caves, and in gunthak near dulak zone.  After you hand that in, he tells you that you are a good assistant, and gives you a nice hit of exp.  He says, You are better than my other assistants, I have a [task] for you if you want to carry it out.  Upon repeating task, he hands you another bag.  This time he asks you for Fecund Luggald Flesh.  Fecund Luggald Flesh drops from the luggalds in Nadox, which are quite a bit higher in level.  Gathering 3 of those fleshes and combining in bag, then turning in, gets this response.  Well! You are ready, go speak with my assistant T`os on the shores of toxxulia.  That is probably far enough way incase something happens.  Travel to toxxulia, through erudin book, run to north shore.  Assistant T`os is waiting for you.  Now, this is where you should have a grp of 58+, tank and slower, because when you hail her ( I learned this the hard way ), she spawns &quot;Fleshless Servant&quot;, level 59 SK who doubles for 515 and HT's for 979.  Upon killing the servant, you loot &quot;Fleshless Heart&quot;.  **Side note- You can kill the fleshless servant as many times as you want by hailing the asisstant, to get hearts for others that are there.  We tried to do that, and I only spawned one extra before I went to turn mine in. A high elven cleric won the roll, but couldn't talk to the fleshweaver, he was dubious.**  Upon returning to fleshweaver in neriak, he says that you better not have returned empty handed.  When you hand the fleshless heart in, he hands you this ring: Fleshweaver's Mark(ring)- 5ac 8sta 4wis 4int 45hp 55mana +5 sv disease Effect: Aura of Health  Clr Dru Mnk Shm Nec Wiz Mag Ench.  All in all, a quest worth doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Theodain2</div><div class="date">03-07-03, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found another quest with same components and a similar reward, finished it a couple of days ago:<br />
<br />
Starts in West Freeport outside the caster guild (also involves Dulak's harbour, Crypt of Nadox and Toxxulia forest): <br />
<br />
Hail Taxonomist Darwin Grisk:<br />
<br />
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says 'Have you come to [help]? If not, be gone! I will not have my time wasted.'<br />
<br />
Tell him I have come to help.<br />
<br />
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says 'Recently rumors have surfaced that a new race, the Luggalds, walks the land. I suspect that some evil force is involved in their appearance. Are you [willing] to risk unknown dangers to help me find out?'<br />
<br />
Say: I am willing<br />
<br />
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says 'Good. I have not been able to confirm the existence of these beings. I will need definite proof if the rest of the members of the Academy are to believe me. Take this Warded Satchel and retrieve three examples of Luggald Flesh.'<br />
<br />
Collect 3 luggald flesh from Luggalds in Dulak's harbour. (at least a nightmare initiate and an archon of malevolence dropped some)<br />
<br />
Hand in the bag, don't forget to combine<br />
<br />
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says 'Very good. This will no doubt convince the others. However, we don't have time to wait for their consensus. Deep in the uncovered Crypt of Nadox the Luggalds seem to be at work. This can mean nothing good for the mortal world. You must provide further [aid].'<br />
<br />
Say: what aid?<br />
<br />
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says 'Travel to the Crypt of Nadox and slay as many of the Luggalds there as you can. This will slow their plans, but to truly damage their efforts I will need more information. Bring me three more samples of their fecund flesh so that I can compare them with the other examples. Combine them in this Warded Chest.'<br />
<br />
Now you need to collect fecund flesh from Luggalds in Crypt of Nadox, again combine 3 flesh in box and hand back to Grisk. (Dropped from luggald abominations and luggald initiates)<br />
<br />
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says 'Alas, it all becomes clear! The Luggalds seek to spread their vile race. I had received word of a dark elf performing arcane rites on the shores of Toxxulia Forest. Now I know she must be attempting to summon other Luggalds. She is expecting an agent of the enemy. Talk with her. Then deal with her and any evil she creates.'<br />
<br />
Find Assistant T'os at the beach in Toxxulia forest (approximate loc was 2200 1500 i believe)<br />
Better have a group ready at this point.<br />
Hail her:<br />
<br />
Assistant T`os says 'Hmm. You aren't familiar. . .no matter.All is ready. Perpare yourself. Who knows what may happen. . .'<br />
<br />
She summons a giant skeleton, kill it and loot a cursed heart from the corpse.<br />
<br />
We also killed assistant T'os but she did not drop anything and I am not sure if it is required or not<br />
<br />
Return to Taxonomist Darwin Grisk and hail him:<br />
<br />
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says 'Thank the gods, you have returned safely! We had heard tell of your battle. Did you by chance find anything of informational value?'<br />
<br />
Hand him the cursed heart:<br />
<br />
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says 'Well done. I can only imagine the evil you averted. Here. Take this a token of my personal thanks. May we all continue to benefit from your valor.'<br />
<br />
I received a Signet of Grisk:<br />

Yesterday i dragged my friends to that zone and we killed for 3 hours nonstop Luggalds (initiates, abominations, chosen, operator, incubator, guards) and had only one flesh drop (from guard). We were in the basement rooms which can be reached by passing the bridge over the lava river.</div></div><hr />

Im going through the secret passageway and then all the way to the bottom.  Waaaay down there with 10ish static spawns.  none of them have &quot;luggald&quot; in their name but they have the appearance. Am I doing something wrong?</div></div><hr />

Leafrat, Yes you are doing something wrong, you are in the wrong zone, they only drop in Nadox.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone figured out if its specific camps or mobs which drop it the most?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Theodain2</div><div class="date">03-10-03, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The flesh drops in Dulak seemed more common than the fecund flesh drops in Nadox, although that might have been due to the fact that the luggalds in Nadox are tougher than the ones in Dulak.<br />
We got drops from all kind of luggalds in both zone if I remember correctly, also one of the incubator operators dropped one.<br />

<br />
I dont know what the melee reward is from Grisk yet. I got this one with my Erudite Sk and Grisk will not talk to me. I tried Human, Assling, and High Elf illusion and he still told me the academy would have nothing to do with my kind. Fleshweaver on the other hand gives the quest to my Human Monk using DE Illusion but would not speak to him as a Human.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">03-16-03, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple notes:<br />
<br />
First off, the Taxonomist can be damn hard to find.  I looked around for an hour before I got a Druid to track him.  Turns out he can spawn on top of the wall near the caster guild.  I could jump up there to talk to him still.<br />
<br />
Secondly, even at 65 I wouldn't recommend trying this quest solo.  The fleshfiend Assistant T`os spawns cons dark blue at 65 and hits for over 400 and summons and rampages.  He can't be mezzed or charmed, but can be snared, rooted and slowed.  My nuke took him down 4%, so I figure he has around 28,000hp.  Was easy with myself (enchanter), cleric and SK though.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rescoto</div><div class="date">04-29-03, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some things:<br />
- Originally the Bonebiter reward was a 1hs which was later corrected to a piercer.  Considering the graphic of the Heartspike, it is likely to be changed to piercer as well, I would imagine.<br />
- I have guild mates who have done the quest from both the Taxonomist and the Fleshweaver.  A high elf Cleric that has done the Fleshweaver's Mark used a dark elf illusion to do turn-ins.<br />
- The regular Luggald Flesh drops most frequently in Dulak at the 3 way bridge in the area behind the false door.<br />
- The Fecund Luggald Flesh drops most commonly in Nadox in the back left corner of the Luggald area across the lava bridge.</div></div><hr />

If you cross the Bridge to the &quot;small&quot; Part head to the Right !<br />
<br />
Theres a Tunnel with harder Luggalds down there.<br />
Those drop Rare Fecund Flesh.<br />
<br />
If you go to the Tunnel ahead of the Bridge .. well slightly left<br />
you are at the Wizard section and get Luggald Hearts =)<br />

<br />
In 2 hours you should get aprox 1 Flesh.<br />
Its not a fast camp but i really like that Ring =)</div></div><hr />
