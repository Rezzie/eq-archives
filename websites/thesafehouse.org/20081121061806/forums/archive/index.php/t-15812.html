Is this a good thing or a bad thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">11-25-04, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bad thing. It's a nerf, from what I hear. I guess it was too good before and let a rogue who bit off more than he could chew (soloing or overaggroing) save his own arse at will, and quite often.<br />
<br />
So they increased the recharge time to something like 30 minutes, and the cast time to 5 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alasdair</div><div class="date">11-26-04, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see this as a huge drawback.  The time I have spent in game, either in an open zone or dungeon, really gives me the impression that five seconds is all that you need for any decent group.  <br />
<br />
Also, do you see a well balanced group having to use the escape ability anymore then once every two hours.  No.  Its for those situations when your either exploring, or you have that rare fak up on a xp camp/item camp.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think adjusting the cast time to 5 seconds and recast at 30 minutes to be acceptable.<br />
