<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jazya</div><div class="date">12-02-03, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe Stanos is on 'Circle of Unseen Hands' (Qeynos Rogue Guild) faction, which I think you can raise by killing bandits/raiders in the Karanas.</div></div><hr />

I had a screen shot of the factions that were affected when we killed him, but computer crashed and was reformatted, and now all is lost =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cinzia Dakhor</div><div class="date">12-05-03, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">NO &quot;Circle of unseen hands&quot; faction on stanos!!<br />
<br />
i think it was only<br />
- HHK Guards (big hit)<br />
- freeport militia (not bit)<br />
- corrupt guards of qeynos (dont know)<br />
- hmmm, halas faction? forgot the name.<br />
<br />
i havnt killed him, but a druid traind the guards after doing him 3 times, we didnt know the faction on him and noone looked at the faction, but the druid looked back and told me the faciton, he was kost to HHK guards, freeport militia threateningly, corruped guards in Qeynos not checked and the last faction unsure which it was, druid was thinking of the halas banker name, but maybe its the halas rogue faction (was an NPC name)<br />
<br />
That faction hits will make you kos to Stanos, from ally to kos maybe 2-3 kills depends on your faction, when you are max ally maybe more hits. If you dont have the seal i wouldnt kill stanos =)</div></div><hr />
