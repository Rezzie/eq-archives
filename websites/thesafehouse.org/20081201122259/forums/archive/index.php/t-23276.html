<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, well, we're gonna have our first official group night coming up in the &quot;soonish&quot; timeframe, and so we should probably pick out what classes we want to play. I would like for everybody participating to post what classes they would be willing to play, list all of them.<br />
<br />
Nice thing about D&amp;D is you can typically make even odd groups work, but we're definitely gonna need some sort of healing, and a rogue would be a major boon (Like that's gonna be difficult.......) Please note if you plan on dual/tri-classing, and if you need any advice for setting up your character for a specific role, feel free to ask and we can figure it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But yeah, other than that, I will be willing to fill any role that is necessary, if no one role is actually necessary to round out the party, I'll be playing either a fighter/barbarian or a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a rogue already.  But I have no clue how to play the other classes.  So relying on me to heal may or may not be a Good Thing.  I would lean towards not.  So...I guess I could be a nuker?  Wiz or Sorc, what's the differences?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want mage, I miss not being able to annoy the living pee out of the group. (note: if it at all effects my getting to be the mage disreguard the first sentence)<br />
So yea I would like to be a spell caster of some sort, if thats at all possible, if not, then a ranger would do quite nicely. I want something where I can stand back and hit from a distance, haven't done it in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wiz or Sorc, what's the differences?<br />
<br />
Wizards are a swiss-army-knife of spells, but can't cast as many per rest period. Sorcerors only learn a set amount of spells but offset this by being able to cast the spells they know a lot more before needing to rest, they also cast quicker. Wizards are good for nuking, but are mainly sought after for their adaptability, they're able to swap out spells in the middle of a quest to gear up more for crowd control, AE damage, single target damage, repairing Warforged, or buffing. Sorcerors must carefully choose what spells to take because they will define themselves through these decisions. Typically sorcs are better suited for doing magical dps because their spellpoint reserves are greater and they cast their spells quicker, not to mention that wizards must 'prepare' the spells they're going to cast, where sorcerors can cast any of the spells that they know. So yeah... it can be a -really- tough choice.<br />
<br />
Personally, I prefer wizards because of their versatility, as it's very difficult to make a 'mistake' while taking spells as a wizard because you can just add more in by buying a scroll and scribing it. Sorcerors are more dependent on using wands to fill in the gaps and said wands do not 'scale' up in damage, they do the same damage/have the same duration/repair the same amount as if you were 'naturally' casting them as the same level as when you are first able to get the spells. So some spells (Like burning hands, magic missile) pale in comparison to the damage you could do if you were casting them 'naturally' at 5th level vs. a wand doing 1st level damage. Some other spells, like (Feather Fall, Charm Person), don't scale up with level and as such, it doesn't really matter if you cast them from a wand or not.<br />
<br />
So yeah, there ya go... a quick and dirty rundown of the arcane casters, hehe...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I called wizard in the other thread!  I guess I could try bard though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Multiple arcane spellcasters is a pretty typical setup, and is often a preferred group layout since you get double the damage and double the crowd control, and they can mem different buffs instead of using up all their spell slots on all of them (Assuming wizard). So don't feel like you have to be something other than a wiz, Yalum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And aside from that, we could very well get two groups going anyway, if more people join in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll give Sorc a try I think.  Maybe Ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">03-10-06, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll play fighter since wizard is already called, also possibly I might want to play barbarian.<br />
<br />
Which would you prefer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-10-06, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends really, my personal favorite way to set up a Barb in this game is as follows:<br />
<br />
1 Fighter<br />
2 Barb<br />
3 Barb<br />
4 Fighter<br />
5 - 10 Barb<br />
<br />
Taking the levels in fighter gives 2 extra feats the barbarian would otherwise not have, and the way I lined out there makes it very easy for you to have Spring Attack at level 4 (Spring attack in DDO basically makes it so you take no penalties for running around while attacking, normally you get -4) but it requires a BAB of +4 and has a couple prerequisite feats (Which also requires minimum 13 DEX). Also, splashing in fighter gives access to Heavy armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-10-06, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there some way to determine what levels what classes get extra feats?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-10-06, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rangers get bonus feats granted to them at levels 2 and 6 relating to two weapon fighting and shooting their bows faster, other than that... Fighters receive extra bonus feats of their choosing at level 1 and every even level thereafter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-10-06, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well what would you suggest for a sit back and shoot lots of arrows/bolts (kinda like the idea of a repeater.  You remeber the template I told you a guy I was grouped with was working on, something similar to that.  Ranged fighting.<br />
<br />
Seems like Fighter for most and Ranger for 2 and 6 for the feats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-10-06, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If going repeating crossbow, a Fighter/Rogue would probably be your best bet so you could do sneak attack damage with every shot if within 30 feet of your target. The main reason to take ranger is to get the +damage add from strength bonuses, and also, the bonus feats for rangers are gained at Ranger 2 and Ranger 6, so at best that would be Ftr4/Rgr6, and none of the quicker firing bonuses will apply to crossbows... or the strength modifier bonus to damage either, for that matter.<br />
<br />
I think that, depending on how you want to build the character, you could make a pretty vicious ranged assassin as a Ftr2/Rog8, and offer quite a bit in the way of trap disarming too. I haven't tested this out (Obviously) but would suggest probably going with an elf or halfling (for the +2 dex bonus, elf gaining more dex from racial enhancements and also ranged damage enhances) rogue at level 1 for a ridiculous amount of skill points. Bump Dex to 16 (Which costs only as many points as bringing most other attributes to 14), int to 14 or 16, wis to 14 at least, and then distributing points around as you see fit. Put skill points into Disable, Spot, Search, et. al., and take dodge as a feat<br />
<br />
Basically... laid out like this:<br />
<br />
1 Rogue - Dodge<br />
2 Fighter - Prof. Heavy Repeater<br />
3 Rogue - Mobility<br />
4 Rogue<br />
5 Fighter - Shot on the Run (So you can move around while reloading, and so you don't interrupt reloading accidentally)<br />
From there on, rogue it up, taking rapid reload feat when you can, then the rest of the feats as you see fit.<br />
<br />
Could make a pretty vicious template, dunno entirely how potent it would be, but I think that it would work well, the only question mark being if Shot on the Run will apply to a crossbow... will consult the forums on that.<br />
<br />
Either way though, with the right enhancements and gear, you'd do awesome damage AND be able to disarm and spot all the traps the party runs into... it's kinda scary, actually... I'll have to try this build out some time... hehehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-10-06, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The more I think about it, the more that build scares me...<br />
<br />
1d8 + 4d6 on 3 attacks in less than a second with those volleys at level 9... Just... insane, hehe.<br />
<br />
And of course, you don't have to go that route... just an idea that came to mind, really... munchkin in me coming to the surface...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That thing has a chance to be ridiculously insane... Not to mention the fact that if you do manage to draw aggro from the beasties, you'll be getting a +4 AC while tumbling in addition to any bonuses you get from the tumble skill itself, so you'll be hard as HELL to actually hit.</div></div><hr />

I missed a feat... you need Point Blank Shot for Shot on the Run as well... so that would necessitate switching levels and such around... will work out a build later.<br />
<br />
Or you can go human, drop Dex by 2, and still get SotR at level 5<br />
<br />
Or... I think you get a feat at level 6, which would just mean waiting one more level and shuffling feat selection around a little bit is all *shrug*</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW I am putting forth a motion to ban the use of fire, ice, or acid weapons.  Killing blows with them destroy the corpse so no collectables can drop.  Sonic, thunder and I think there is one other, are fine to use.  (Until they fix it that is)</div></div><hr />

+6 armor, +5 max dex bonus, -0 check penalty, and it is classed as light armor, amazing armor... I found one for 6k in the pawn shop, halfling only :D :D.<br />

right now I have a sickle of sypheros, a +1 acid light mace of power (lol), and a +1 flaming rapier, in addition to my flametouched +1 returning throwing dagger, +1 light mace of lesser goblinoid bane, +1 ghost touch rapier, and +1 holy club...<br />

Also mithril armor is bugged, visually. It's saying my rogue has a +5 to attack mod on the inventory screen, but in actuallity it's still applying my +9 when I swing... :).</div></div><hr />

I don't consider it a fetish, I keep on hand about 3/4 to a whole bag full of weapons all the time, I am prepared to face almost anything be it: incorporeal (ghost touch), bludgeon only (skeles), trolls (fire), fire creatures (frost), ice creatures (fire), stupid special giants (adamanteen), flametouched (still not sure). I keep 2 handers for when I'm not tanking and a +4 shield and a set of one handers for when I am. I almost always get the most kills because I am almost always prepared.

I also switched to robes/black widdow bracers because I got a 5/magic damage reduction robe, so I'm sitting pretty at 21 ac with 5 damage reduction :D<br />
<br />
<br />
In delera's tomb with this setup... only the arcane skeletons were hitting me for more than 1 or 2. The Skeletal Arcus (archers) couldn't hurt me for more than 1 damage, it was sick! I would tank them, almost impervious to their damage... black widow bracers and an invuln robe is probably the best setup a rogue can get right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Progression Chart<br />
1: Ranger - Bow Strength, Point Blank Shot,<br />
2: Ranger - Rapid Shot<br />
3: Fighter - Dodge, Mobility<br />
4: Fighter - Shot on the Run<br />
5: Fighter - No Feats<br />
6: Fighter - Weapon Focus: Ranged, Multishot<br />
7: Fighter - No Feat<br />
8: Fighter - Improved Critical: Ranged,<br />
9: Fighter - Weapon Specialization: Ranged,<br />
10: Fighter - Greater Weapon Focus: Ranged.<br />
<br />
Net result, point blank shot, +2 to all ranged attack rolls, with a 10 base attack bonus (By level 10 it will be a 20 mod easy), str mod to damage rolls, with multi-shot, rapid shot, and shot on the run keeping arrows flying, also improved threat ranges on the arrows. <br />
<br />
I think this shows a bit more potential than the rogue/fighter repeater build, along with a greater weapon selection as you're not limited to heavy repeater or light, and, It's just wicked fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that said, me being able to play is somewhat in question (Work might need me to switch shifts with somebody), but get your damn characters made and those who don't make it will just catch up.<br />
<br />
Next week, I know for a fact that I can't come. (Tuesday is really the only night of the week that will always work for me)</div></div><hr />

I believe rangers get extra damage depending on their str, not sure if thats general or only for rangers. Anyhow I am going to go create motego and run him through the first couple quests and into the main harbor. Dunno if T's gona be here, depends on if he had to work this morning or ... right now.</div></div><hr />

Its Motego Shanah, I forgot what his last name was going to be and I was too lazy to check what I had said earlier so I just went with something that sounded alike.... heh</div></div><hr />

Heck I can't wait for the next game night, I like my character and wana shoot more kobolds. Oh, rag got some bracers of grease so he will be filling in for me in that area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
16 str, 10 dex, 16 con, (maybe 14 can't remember off hand) 12 int (made a mistake, this was suposed to be into dex but didn't notice it until I had already started playing) 10 wis 12 cha.<br />
<br />
I am guessing drop int to 10, cha to 10 and put thos points into dex for high str, dex, and con.<br />
<br />
Altho 17 into str and lvl 2 rank 1 I can get a +1 str to give me 18.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grrr.  I think I might have screwed my warrior badly and it is best to correct it now at such a low level where I can leveling him back up before the next gaming session.</div></div><hr />

I no longer sit there, and tab, tab, tab, tab... I run around, shooting at everything. no penalties for shooting while moving, and you reload as you run. with autoattack? you fire just as fast as if you were standing still.</div></div><hr />

We have a bard, ranger, and a fighter if we can get rag fixed in time :poke, if he switches to warforged then a mage and a cleric would be a good idea I think. Seeing as that would completely cover group healing and the damage is always nice. Ideas?</div></div><hr />

I would say a rogue and cleric.  Gotta have a trap popper and lock picker.  so about my warforged!  Lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">03-30-06, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking that a while after I posted, .. waitaminute.. if you warforged has enough hp, he can &quot;disarm&quot; traps. I'm citing Rogar the Barbarian (the gamers) along with tea and I's combined idea.... Though yea, a rogue would be good.. anyone want to be a rogue?</div></div><hr />

Just take Adamantine Plating as yer first feat :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-30-06, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also... warforged can increase the benefit they get from divine healing from enhancements anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-30-06, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah but stats and stuff yo.  Also I assumed lvl 2 will be my sorc level for wand usage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-31-06, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I wouldn't take the level in sorc period. Level 2 has a warforged enhancement to bring you to 60% benefit from divine healing, and there's one big issue with wangds. Two, acgually.<br />
<br />
Fidst off (WTF is up with these damn typos... I'm sick, goddammit. Not correcting for posterity's sake. Besides. &quot;wangds&quot;) Wands are expensive, mmmkay? Secondrly, the wands cast as the first level of a caster able to use them. So that wand of repair light wounds? Heals for about 5 damage. Cleric at level two? Probably healing 12 to 15, which halved will be more than your wand. It's your character though, I'm just pointing this out, hehe. I think people really overreact to the minor drawback of warforged, to the point where I've seen groups actually kick WFs out of the party because the wizard or sorc didn't want to heal them and the cleric wasn't going to &quot;waste spellpoints&quot; on them.<br />
<br />
I'll likely be running a cleric tomorrow night, assuming I'm able to concentrate on the game (On the up side, my sickness is waning!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-31-06, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding was the spell cast based on your level.  Lvl 1 sorc, lvl 3 fighter = lvl 4.  Dunno, maybe I was reading wrong.<br />
<br />
I was just thinking more SP to heal the others.  But if you guys are cool healing a WF I'll gladly go pure fighter.  WF with Adman body plating.<br />
<br />
So help me build the uber WF fighter.  Should I dump 18 str, or 16 to start and use and action point at lvl 5 for 2 str?  Definately mad con, 16 perhaps?  Since I'll be Adm body dex will be damn near useless, maybe 12 for my max ac bonus of +1.  2H or sword and board?<br />
<br />
Main problem, my cha will suck ass giving a negative to intimidate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-31-06, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use wands up to your total level (So a level 2ftr/1src could cast a level 2 sorceror spell wand) but unlike casting a spell 'naturally,' the effect from the wand does NOT scale up. Thus, a wand of magic missile (level 1 caster) will only fire off 1 missile whether the user is level 1, or level 10. They also don't receive any bonuses to the effects, so a sorceror with improved combustion won't apply that bonus to a burning hands spell cast from a wand.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that to use the wand, you have to disarm yourself, which is a whole extra drawback... *cough*</div></div><hr />

Dex 12<br />

I mean I'm sure we will have people that can handle that part of the spectrum... maybe I'm forgetting something.. do you need +0 to use potions or something?<br />

Ok I just decided to actually read.. it seems I did miss something.. not a word from any of you :stalk</div></div><hr />

<br />
So many things, even early on, require 18 strength to use... it sucks to have to skip content.<br />
<br />
I'd honestly say drop int to the minimum, dex to 10, and I'm torn on the wisdom... so hard to weigh between will saves, and more str =P<br />
<br />
But then, being deathtouched because of a ****ty will save sucks =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-31-06, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So in this order<br />
Str, Con, Wis, dex at 10.<br />
<br />
Sound about right?<br />
<br />
Admantine body, now what's a good second feat, Power attack for cleave when I get my next feat?</div></div><hr />
