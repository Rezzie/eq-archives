<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, to clear up some misconceptions: Defender and Healer are NOT synonymous terms. A lot of people think of Defenders as EQ Clerics, and that is simply not true at all. In fact, Empath Controllers have the potential to be better Healers than most non-empath Defenders. (Generally, Any Controller will only heal 75% as much as a similar level Controller When using the same power, all other things being equal)<br />
<br />
The following Power Sets have Healing abilities, and are available to Both Defenders and Controllers<br />
<br />
Empathy: This is the most diverse Healing Set, It has 2 Single Target Heals, and one Point Blank AOE Heal. Most Defenders/Controllers which Want to focus solely on Healing will take this power set.<br />
<br />
Heal Other - Main Single Target Heal for most cases, Requires Line of sight<br />
<br />
Healing Aura - An AOE Heal - It generally isn't a Huge heal, and is Endurance Costly, but it is the only power the empath has that heals himself as well. Usually great for Topping off 3 or more people's health.<br />
<br />
Absorb Pain -Huge heal, Low Endurance cost, but takes 15-20% of the User's Health. Used best with Tanks, can generally heal over 50% of their health for a same level tank. This also prevents them from being healed by themselves, and other characters can only ehal them with siome targetted heals. I know A 2nd empath can heal them with Heal Other, but I'm not sure if all targetted heals will work. Low HPs prevent them from being able to use this power without dieing, and essentially cuts their healing power in half.<br />
<br />
Tactics Empaths prefer to use when Healing: Ideally, Keep Most damage on a Tanker or Scrapper, and use single targetted heals. For all others (Defenders/Blasters/Controllers) Keep close to the Empath. They will typically use their AOE to keep them up in health. If you have multiple Empaths in the Group, I commonly see one stay up with the Melee pack to use the AOE heal with them too, while the second stays with the non-melee group. <br />
<br />
Remember, Even if you are 5 feet away from an empath healer, Line of Sight problems can block their targeted heals. Remember this if you are fighting in enclosed quarters with a lot of obstacles.<br />
<br />
Empath Heals generate no aggro, So they can commonly stand in the middle of a rough fight and heal away, assuming no villains are using AOEs. (This may not apply as much to those filling 2 roles, such as a Controller who is doing heals and Crowd control simultaneously.)<br />
<br />
Dark Miasma: Their only available Heal is Twilight Grasp. It requires an enemy to target. The power causes an ACC and DMG debuff on the target, and Causes an AOE Heal focused on the Hero using this power. Tis power may also miss, as it requires a to-hit roll.<br />
<br />
Line of Sight restrictions between the Caster and person being healed do not matter for this type of heal, but Range is still a limiting factor. Whenever possible, you will need to stay very near the Hero casting for their heals to affect you.<br />
<br />
Kinetics: Their only Heal is Transfusion. This also requires a roll to hit, Drains Enemy Endurance and triggers an AOE heal around the enemy targetted. Thus, it is similar to Dark Miasma, Except that you will need to stay near the enemy targetted rather than the hero in order to be healed.<br />
<br />
Radiation Emission: They have the power Radiant Aura. It is an AOE heal, focused on the Hero casting it. Thus, very similar to Dark Miasma, except that there is no to-hit roll, so their power may be a little bit more reliable as a healing ability. Also generates no aggro.<br />
<br />
Storm Summoning: They recieve the power 02 Boost, which is a targetted heal. It suffers the same LOS restrictions as an Empath's targetted heals do, but has significantly mroe range than any of the AOE heals. Also generates no aggro.<br />
<br />
Force Field: Defenders/Controllers with this power do not have any Heals.<br />
<br />
Unless you are with an Empath, Do not be 100% certain your Defender/Controller is a Healer. Ask them, before you expect them to heal in your group. Quite a few With non-empathy power sets may skip their heal power entirely, or with force fields may never even have a chance to get one at all.<br />
<br />
And in a group with Multiple Healers, it is very important to sort out who is responsible for what. But the various permutations of that are a bit too complicated to deal with here. In short, You kind of have to figure out who can do what to heal, and then build on that. If you have an Storm summoner and a Radiation Emissions person, you could let one be responsible for keeping the group topped off, while one focuses only on the most damaged person, such as a tanker or scrapper.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, Make sure you are where you need to be to be healed. Ask the Healer if need be, they are probably more familiar with the limitations on their powers than those they group with. Plus, just showing that you know to adjust your tactics/positioning to help the healer out some makes it more likely they will think kindly of you when they have enough endurance for only one more heal in a rough fight.</div></div><hr />

And they always look at me stupid when I point out there's only a one in five chance the Defender is actually a dedicated healer, if that. So without fail, random defender pickup can't heal meaningfully and everyone acts all surprised and think it's the Defenders fault they died.<br />
<br />
When I do find myself teamed specifically with an Empath, I always make a point to discuss healing responsibilities with them. It's just common sense, especially if they favored their secondary powers as they leveled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One more tip when grouping with an empath healer... if they tell you that they can't heal you worth a crap on a mission... it's time to find a new mission. I can't tell you how many times just one group of mine died on a Tsoo mission because they couldn't figure out proper aggro control or that they had to kill the sorceror first... and of course, it was my fault some of them had 8k plus debt, because they thought they could do a mission from somebody 3 levels higher than them... *sigh*<br />
<br />
On the up side though, I have worked up quite the reputation for myself, and often catch the ass end of conversations which follow along the lines of, &quot;Trust me, Lemon Aide is -THE- healer. You won't be dying unless the mission is WAY over our heads.&quot; Always a good ego booster =)<br />
<br />
I forgot where I was going with this... oh yeah, don't invite me to an 8-man group where I am the only healer in a bunch of blasters and a single scrapper... I don't like debt, and that's what you'll be getting if you think we can take a freakshow mission from the highest level member of that group! *cough*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my time as a radiation defender i just have one thing to say. <br />
<br />
&quot; IF YOU AREN&quot;T IN THE ****ING GREEN RING YOU WILL DIE, I AM NOT GOING TO RUN DOWN ALL OF YOU NEWBIES TO HEAL YOU INDIVIDUALLY (*#(%@#%&quot;<br />
<br />
ahh much better. Yes, meddik brings up a very very good point. It is very critical to know what type of healer / defender you have. As a rad defender i put 6 slots of heal into my heal and at 22 it heals for 125 pts. That from my experience is more than enough to keep the group alive. The problem is, most blasters like to stay wayyyy back, or move around for some reason, they leave my healing area. They pull agro from the tank and then run around like newbies in eq instead of just waiting for a heal to come their way.<br />
<br />
The way i healed was i stayed so that the tank was at the edge of my healing radius, so that way i can give the squishy blasters / scrappers / controllers some room to work. Though it never failed theres always that blaster that doesn't assist pulls all the agro from one mob, or aes too early, then runs away...dies...whines that he didn't get healed...say i suck...then leave the group. All in all yes, listen to meddiks words of wisdom, and know your healers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the funny part is that there is an equal 1 in 5 chance of a Controller being an Empath. So 4/5ths of the Defenders may be worse ehalers than the controllers they are overlooking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have a problem keeping a group healed if I end up hurricane tanking, keeping all the range attackers in the cloud, pushing everything around... :) it's quite fun, but if we get hurt, it's harsh with just o2 boost. Nice post.</div></div><hr />

(Empath/Radiation Defender)<br />
<br />
I think I will never call playing a healer 'dull' again. I think it required more situational awareness than I use playing a Scrapper, and that's saying alot. I did have one death in the first battle, because I stupidly had a monster selected, but once I remembered what Coggins once told me about how Assist works in this game, it got much more managable.<br />
<br />
I was always appreciative of healers before, but now I truly respect the skill of the good ones I've grouped with. Everything you said above proved true. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pharroh</div><div class="date">05-18-04, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Storm Defender seems to heal pretty well in a group that can focus damage on just one or two members (i.e. a group with a Tank).  O2 Boost is the second best single-target heal, after all.  Also, with Snow Storm, Steamy Mist, Freezing Rain, Hurricane, etc, we are very good at reducing the damage that our team takes.</div></div><hr />

Just out of curiosity, how well slotted is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mony</div><div class="date">06-24-04, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say that healing has been driving me nuts.  Whenever I get into a group, I point out repeatedly that for my heal to work, I need people to be in heal range of the mob I have targetted.  I keep repeating this.  People keep ignoring me, or run all over the place, or (grrr) killing the mob just before my heal lands.<br />
<br />
I had a blaster yell at me the other day for not keeping him alive.  Um.  First of all, all the mobs in the mission were purple to me and I pointed that out right away.  Second, the blaster would rarely be in the cone range for my heals.  Third, if he was, he'd nuke the mob I just targetted my heal on before the heal could finish 'casting'.  I wanted to poke him in the eye.<br />
<br />
I really do like playing defenders, which shocks the heck out of me.  I'm not particularly interested in playing an Empathy Defender.  Tess is my highest character at 11 now, kinetics/electricity.  I'm debating whether or not I should level up a different defender as one of my mains.  Bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aura</div><div class="date">06-24-04, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My best friend IRL is a kin defender, and we hunt together most of the time we play. I play a blaster. In defense to the people who run away from the mobs: They're weighing their trust in you healing them against the amount of debt they recieve if their trust is misplaced. If they've just met you, they probably don't trust you a bunch yet, so they choose to run off for fear that you won't get your heal off. The solution is to heal earlier than you think you need to, though I realize this comes with complications of its own, so the REAL solution is just to get to the point where people know/trust you and group with those people.<br />
<br />
As far as blasters killing your mobs (because this is really where I have the most experience), if you haven't called the mob as your &quot;bitch,&quot; the blaster's gonna nuke it. I hunt with my friend in the same room, and even when he calls it aloud, sometimes I forget - although sometimes, I nuke the mob into hell before siphon speed goes off...just cause I like to hear him say &quot;You son of a bitch!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Not well at all!  2 slots, one a recharge reduction and one a heal (DO's). <br />
<br />
The real thing is, I don't want to waste slots on it at the moment.<br />
<br />
I think my character is like a shaman trying to be a main healer.  You have that moment of indecision at times thinking, do I use my paltry heal now or do I attempt to slow?  I think with this character though my decision is easier, I can't keep up with damage using my heal, so I have to prevent it from happening in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Patofnaud</div><div class="date">06-28-04, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hardest part I am finding as a healer in CoH is my EQ mind keeps kinking in and they are totally different healers.<br />
<br />
My EQ cleric can heal through walls/over pipes/up stairwells, my CoH one can not. As I play with a lot of ex-EQ folks I find my self CONSTANTLY telling them to stay in range if they want heals. I am constantly seeing &quot;Target Blocked&quot; message if I don't.<br />
<br />
I took a bit hard route in that I made a controller/grav prim/empath secondary. So I tend constantly play the &quot;Should I heal the tank or lock down the boss&quot; game.<br />
<br />
I'm finding out that a good AE hold just after the tank pulls, then lock down the bosses with Grav Dist before I go healer mode works well. Only down side is if the tank takes way too much heat on the pull he may drop before I get stuff locked down. But if I heal first then everyone goes down to a riot coming into camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">06-28-04, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took a bit hard route in that I made a controller/grav prim/empath secondary.

<br />
<br />
Yeah, that would be tough.  A SG friend of mine took Mind/Empath and we occassionally play together (two mind controllers in the same group).  Anyway, often times he'll switch over to empath mode and let me lock things down.  <br />
<br />
I have to say though, the combination of controller/storms is really awesome right now.  It's not so much that my Mind abilities are all that hot, but the combination is wonderful.</div></div><hr />

You son of a bitch!<br />

As a 32 kinetics defender, you'll prefer to heal scrappers over blasters. I've only had a scrapper run on me once. Kinetics isn't really a power set to be the main healer. We can dish out speed boost (which is a perma recovery aura/mini-hasten...6-slot it with end recov!!), heal everyone's endurance (mmmm...transference), and AE add to damage. <br />
<br />
If you do play the role of a healer (I can heal for 600 off 32s, not bad for having 700 or so health) warn your victims about 3 things:<br />
1. Force the halfway retarded blasters to always stand next to you. They look for things to kill, while you look for their next mob/heal.<br />
2. Make sure they keep a straggler minion alive/nearby, especially if it's down to a minion and a boss. If things get too rough, you can always repel the minion. =-)<br />
3. Never play healer for purples. Even with Empathy's fortitude buff, I average 5-10% on purples, for like 100. On oranges you'll be useful, but a self-sufficient tank will be a must. Apart from that, you should be fine...more or less.<br />
<br />
Do that, and you can play a great pseudo-healer. We've started splitting off into two groups of 3 these days: Blaster (Tycho), Tanker, and me versus Emp Defender, Scrapper, Blaster. When we do that, the xp bar makes me smile again.</div></div><hr />
