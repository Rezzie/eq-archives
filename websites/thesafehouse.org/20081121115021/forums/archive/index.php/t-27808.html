As you step over trust you find a comfort and calming that can only come from &quot;knowing&quot; that those around you make you stronger. As you step through unity you find the strength that comes from being part of something greater than you could ever achieve alone. As you step into Community you feel a lasting presence, a home in all of those around you, so that even in the darkest depths home is never far. Only after you have stepped over Trust, through Unity, and into Community do you understand what it is that makes a guild great, it's people, for they are the achievers of greatness that give names their power.<br />

Mental Truancy is a casual to hardcore Vanguard guild. We will group together, hold guild events, discover the in's and out's of Vanguard, and raid all of the big encounters. Fun is number 1 when it comes to our priorities. As the name Mental Truancy implies we only take things as serious as they need to be, we want to enjoy Vanguard as a game but understand that at times serious consideration is necessary to see all that Vanguard will offer. To keep the peace, guild rules are strictly enforced but not without an understanding of exceptions. We have no restrictions on who can become a member but will enforce a &quot;buddy&quot; system for several weeks to get to know any new recruit. <br />
<br />
We belive strongly in communication so if you are interested and share our ideals, come and speak with us in the Mental Truancy forums.<br />
