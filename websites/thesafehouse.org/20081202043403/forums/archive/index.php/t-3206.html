You were given a title for the event I think.  Was it the Betrayer?  <br />
<br />
I am trying to come up with a couple of titles of rewards for &quot;Safehouse quests&quot; and want names that are Ring specific rather than EQ specific.</div></div><hr />

We were lucky enough to have a certain someone show up as a GM and make things even cooler than what he originally had planned.<br />
<br />
My title was &quot;Glip the Betrayer&quot; even though I think it was a typo.  I'm sure it was supposed to say &quot;Glip the Hero&quot; I mean, the keys are like right next to each other.  <br />
<br />
Did you want the storyline for the events too or just the title? Glip the Gnome<br />

<br />
Actually, what the hell. Post it if you like or email it to me @ colin@colinlevine.com if it's too awkward to post.  If nothing else, I could probably adjust to fit the history of the item. Edited by: Dargesh  at: 6/26/02 11:19:31 pm</div></div><hr />
