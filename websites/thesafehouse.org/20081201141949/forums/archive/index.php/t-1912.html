<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-14-03, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What happened? First Trading Spaces, and now......every network has them. YES, THE TRUE HUMAN SPIRIT IS SEEN WHEN PEOPLE MUST BUILD @#%$!!!! How did something relativly cool and intresting become The Real World with a hammer and 3 penny nails? USA has one now, TLC has 3 seperate spin offs, countless others follow suit, each one more ludicrous than the next. Now, not only do people build @#%$ that someone is probably going to hate them for, but they get angry while doing it too, in the best marriage of Reality TV drama that the American public drink it up like it's Chablis, and Reality TV that has a point so people don't smash their foot through the TV in digust at themselves. <br />
<br />
I hate reality TV. It's not reality. It's just as much fantasy as the next show. No where in reality do 8 total strangers get together, get coddled, get offered more money than most make in their lives to do simple tasks like play twister. No where in reality do you get offered millions of dollars to whore out your affections and act like you have a soul, and that you don't care about the money. It's not reality.<br />
<br />
It is even less realistic when a couple with no interior, carpentry, or electrical design skills get handed a bunch of money to refinish a house, all under the watchful eye of professionals who would just rather they go grab a cup of coffee and pass out sniffing the wood lacquer.  <br />
<br />
Maybe I should forget all this academic @#%$ I'm learning in college, all the history, and law, and civics, and just sign my unremarkable creative skills over to people who lap up the first un-original idea to spring from my dome. I can easily do what apparently pays good money on TV these days, sit on my ass, watch someone else's work, come up with a new name for it, spin it slightly so I can't be sued, make bank, and pat myself on the back for something someone else did.  &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">10-14-03, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice to you is start taking classes that actually matter. My favorite classes right now are White Water Kayaking, Rock Climbing and Still Photo I. I should have been a Fine Art: Photo major. Once I started taking CS classes when I no longer got to code and it was all theory is when things started to die about it. If I can't create...count me out! :&quot;&gt;</div></div><hr />

There's your first mistake right there. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everytime there is a successful show, other networks try to mirror the success.  Take &quot;Who Wants to be a Millionaire?&quot; for example.  After that became successful, every main network made at least one primetime gameshow - Twenty-One, You Don't Know Jack, Weakest Link, etc.  The same thing happened with Survivor.  Now every network has at least two Reality Shows on and most of them have the same basic premiss (voting off people).<br />
<br />
I always wanted a version of &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; where they took two families that hate each other and make them redo each other's rooms with no help from designers, but I'm a malicious person.   <br />
