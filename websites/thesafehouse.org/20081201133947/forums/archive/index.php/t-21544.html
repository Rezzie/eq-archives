Thank you for your support for Sigil and for being a part of the Vanguard Community. Many of you have been with us since before we even announced our first title. You have helped to establish the foundation for what this community will be as it grows throughout Beta and into public release. We have promised since the beginning that our community members would have the first opportunity to get into our Beta program, before the general public. Well, that time has finally arrived!<br />
<br />
<br />
This is your chance to apply for the Vanguard: Saga of Heroes Beta program from Microsoft Game Studios, developed by Sigil Games Online.  To begin, please click (or copy and paste) the link at the bottom of this email  <br />

:eek  :party:  :Blow:    Maybe ill get to play with you guys soon enough!</div></div><hr />

Actual acceptance to the beta comes after that, and you still have to get your hardware approved. But grats on getting the email, none the less.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolep</div><div class="date">11-24-05, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just wondering how long it usually took to get your acceptance letter, and if they sent you one if you aren't accepted.  I got this email on the 19th of November and have been eagerly awaiting another.  Also, could anyone in beta tell me what the hardware requirements are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-24-05, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually they can't. That information is protected by the NDA.</div></div><hr />

1. You might never get into the beta, so it might take 1 week or 3 months or never for the next email to come<br />
<br />
2. You won't get an email if you aren't accepted<br />
<br />
<br />
This is just an invitation for applying for the Beta test.</div></div><hr />
