<br />
All five planets that can be visible to the naked eye will appear together<br />
in the evening sky later this month in a viewing opportunity that won't be<br />
matched for 32 years.<br />
Going in order from West to East, the cast of planetary characters will be<br />
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn and Jupiter. All but Mercury are already<br />
visible. The winged messenger is the most elusive of the five, being so<br />
close to the Sun that it never gets very far above the horizon, and always<br />
only near dawn or dusk.<br />
<br />
By late March, Mercury will be about as high as possible at dusk for viewers<br />
at mid-northern latitudes, setting the stage for a memorable few weeks of<br />
easy-to-do backyard skywatching.<br />
<br />
Where to look<br />
<br />
Mercury will hover above the setting Sun in the West. Higher up, brilliant<br />
Venus already dominates the stage, outshining all stars and planets. Mars,<br />
much dimmer than it was last summer, is high in the southwestern sky. Saturn<br />
is nearly overhead now at dusk and to the south. Jupiter, now stunningly<br />
bright, is king of the eastern evening sky, rising just as the Sun goes<br />
down.<br />
<br />
Robert C. Victor, a long-time astronomer at the Abrams Planetarium at<br />
Michigan State University, now retired, has for some four decades<br />
specialized in predicting and observing unusual configurations of the<br />
planets. Victor said there won't be a more easily observed display of all<br />
five naked-eye planets at dusk until April 2036.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to encourage astronomy clubs and planetariums to schedule<br />
twilight public viewing sessions during March 22-31, including the final<br />
weekend, March 26-28, for this wonderful occasion,&quot; Victor said. &quot;Sessions<br />
should begin by about 45 minutes after sunset, to insure catching Mercury<br />
before it sinks too low.&quot;<br />
<br />
Armed with a simple sky map, people can find the planets on their own from<br />
any backyard. Each of the planets will be bright enough to be seen under<br />
most urban lighting conditions, too.<br />
<br />
The setup is possible this month because all of the planets are on the same<br />
side of the Sun, as envisioned from above the solar system. The planets<br />
create no light of their own, of course, but shine by reflecting sunlight.<br />
<br />
Rare opportunity<br />
<br />
A wide variety of different configurations involving the planets typically<br />
occur during the course of any given year. It is quite unusual, however, to<br />
spot the five brightest planets in the sky at the same time.<br />
<br />
According to Jean Meeus of Belgium, a specialist in spherical and<br />
mathematical astronomy, there are 12 similar cases between the years 1980<br />
and 2020. But, he also points out that some of these (such as in August 2016<br />
and July 2020) will be difficult to enjoy because some of the planets will<br />
be very low in the sky.<br />
<br />
Victor notes that there will be another fine chance to view all five<br />
planets -- in the morning sky -- during late December 2004 through early<br />
January 2005.<br />
<br />
From our earthly vantagepoint, we can readily observe Mercury, Venus, Mars,<br />
Jupiter and Saturn with our unaided eyes when they are favorably positioned<br />
in their orbits around the Sun. Each of these planets appears to move<br />
against the starry background at their own speeds and along their own<br />
tracks. Since they are constantly moving at different speeds in relation to<br />
other objects, the positions of all five planets at any particular time is<br />
unique to that moment.<br />

<br />
Also for the stargazers... 2 comets have a good chance at being seen by the naked eye this summer. One more definite than the second. Both are minor and not nearly as dynamic as Hale Bopp, but naked eye visible nonetheless.</div></div><hr />
