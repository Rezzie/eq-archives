<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my review so far - picked up the game Friday, and played on and off through the weekend.<br />
<br />
I  :heart  creating new costumes for superheroes, lots of options - can go wild coming up with some truly unique looks.  It's too bad there isn't a way to update them once you've started the game - one little error in costume design (had blended the gloves the wrong way) and I found myself deleting the character and starting from scratch.  One of the ones I was working on almost looked like Seven of Nine :borg before I realized what I was doing and changed it around.<br />
<br />
I also am having problems trying to figure out how to swing the camera in front of my 'toon so I can get a frontal screenshot - everything I've taken so far of her is of her butt.  Not to say that it isn't a rather shapely butt, but I'd love to show off her glowing red eyes to my friend... speaking of which...<br />
<br />
.tga formatted screenshots are REALLY huge - I've been too lazy to reformat before sending to a friend who might be interested in playing - so I've been sending them 1 at a time to keep my email server from barfing on me. ;)  Names of characters don't get saved in screenshots - so it's a good idea to write down the name that went with the shot if it was something funny like &quot;The Original Bling&quot; wearing a purple pimp suit. ;)<br />
<br />
Group battles are cool - but all of those flashy effects do get a bit disorienting and I had some trouble finding my next target - is the reason I have spell effects off on EQ raids, just gets too hard to see - I will have to look and see if I can customize my display options to clean that up a little bit.<br />
<br />
$14.95 a month is a little pricey, but I don't expect that I'll be playing for as long as I've been playing EverQuest... I'm already at level 8 after about 12 hour played in this game - I have a feeling I might hit the level cap of this game relatively quickly if the levelling difficulty curve doesn't go up a bit more swiftly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">to rotate the camera hold down the scrolly thingy on the mouse and swing it around.<br />
<br />
as for the leveling pace, you can get to level 8 in a couple hours, by level 10 you're going to hit a wall, by the time you rhit 14 you realize the pace is ALOT different than you thought it would be. <br />
<br />
The thing is so many people enjoy making different characters that they make lots and lots of low level toons, and since you can get to 10 pretty quickly they think that's how the entire game will be (since they get a toon to 10 or maybe even 14, then make another character)<br />
<br />
Trust me the exp curve ramps up quick in the teens.</div></div><hr />

I love the character creation part.  There are SO many options for creating characters and the costumes are just a hoot.  I've only been playing a couple days but so far I really like it!</div></div><hr />
