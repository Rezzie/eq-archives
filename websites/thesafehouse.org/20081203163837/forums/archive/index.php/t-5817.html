<br />
And also think about multi-questing. Now, for people that have connections, you can farm not only 1 spawn, but 30 or so (1 on every server)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, it wouldn't be fair to the people on the server if someone has equipment from places like ST or ToV goes to a server that hasn't been able to do those places yet.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think being able to move individual characters to other accounts is a GREAT idea.  Especially for friends or famalier you got hokked on the gaming using your account.<br />
<br />
Moving characters to other servers though?  I think it will only lead to bad things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Malse</div><div class="date">07-06-01, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you allowed nodrop items, there are  number of nodrop quest items that are sufficiently farmable that a small group of people across all servers could get a lock on the spawns, and more or less force you to pay them (Raster of Guk springs to mind, with all the loony monk twinks running around).<br />
<br />
With character moves, it would be trivial to move the items to the servers that are paying for them and keep rotating characters out often enough that people don't catch on.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it -would- happen, but I would have never thought people would have payed real money for game items, or that guilds would pay players with planar gear to farm spawns, etc. There is a particular guild on Ayonae Ro who does a marvelous job of monopolizing the Ancient Cyclops in OOT for multiquest sales, and if people are willing to put up with that sort of effort for so little gain, they're willing to do a lot of other sleazy things, too.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I don't think VI is trying to avoid any specific problems, but instead avoiding all potential problems. For once, I agree with them (although I would have never allowed character moves at all). Edited by: Malse at: 7/6/01 2:01:59 pm</div></div><hr />
