The 2 dragons before the final boss were much harder than her.  Plus the ending kinda stunk because you couldnt go back and talk to Lord Nasher and Arin Ghend after you finished.  Plus the loot in the last area was really pointless.  Ooh 3 gold that I cant spend.  Though I must say I really liked chapter 3.  Having to turn the snow globe to talk to either the dwarfs or the druids was really clever.  Plus I just love killing dragons.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else finished the official campaign yet?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I managed to get Aribeth back to the good side though.  And now we're an item.  Not that they go into any of that in the crappy ending they give you.<br />
<br />
And your right.  the 2 dragon fight was WAY harder than Morag(once I figured out how to pierce her immunities).</div></div><hr />

I am a 20 rogue using Dalean (sp) as my henchman and can't even get one of them to drop.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dramir</div><div class="date">07-12-02, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only advice I have for the two dragons is to buff yourself to high heaven and stock up on heal potions.  I think you can still use the stone of recall so just port out when you need to.  Also, one of the dragons is weaker, examine them to find out which one it is and go for him first.</div></div><hr />

That wounded 3 of them, so I continued until I ran out of charges and they were dead. Then I tried to kill the lighting one, but he was immune too (because of the proc on my weapon I guess).. so I started killing them with a fearsome ... Staff of Neg. Energy.   Only 2-4 damage each shot, but they didn't have that much HP luckily.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TibisHatter</div><div class="date">07-15-02, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just about to go into the final battle when I stopped playing last night.<br />
<br />
18 Fighter / 2 Rogue  + Tomi Undergallows (without whom the game would have been a lot harder).  Took two levels in rogue early on to get some sneak attack and evasion ability; those two things alone were worth the loss of 1 BAB and a fighter bonus feat.<br />
<br />
The two dragon fight was a lot easier than I thought it would be - although I had managed to set my gear up so I had good defenses against what they could throw at me (immunity to mind-affecting spells, elemental resistances, high AC).<br />
<br />
Cool things throughout the game - the foreboding to Aribeths Fall; gnomes liking &quot;their pickles sour and their women tall&quot;; the frequent amusing reactions to my characters low CHA (8); the Dwarf / Dryad episode in the Snow Globe; travelling back in time to introduce a single, telling flaw in otherwise invincible golems; shifting alignment between good / evil depending on actions (I ended with the alignment title: The Benefactor); tricking an ancient red dragon.<br />
<br />
Things that irritated me: one henchman - no way to have a balance of abilities in the party; the trial in Chapter 4 where there appeared to be no way to get an acquittal; &quot;Oh I can pick that open easy!&quot;; loose interpretation of 3E D&amp;D rules, especially several missing Feats (no Spring Attack?  No Whirlwind?).<br />
<br />
I think I managed to do most of the quests available, although I only hired Tomi all the way through so I didn't get any of the &quot;Tales&quot; of the other hirlings.  I also was never able to find the &quot;Ashes of a hero&quot; for Tomi's last tale.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to know what the spell the Duergar mages were throwing at me that had a spectral hydra waving about most of the screen for its duration.  It didn't seem to affect me much, but it killed Tomi four times out of the five I wasn't able to stop it from being cast.  Also, the spell that could blind me with no saving throw or resistance roll was frustrating as well.  When that happened I pretty much had to Recall away for a cure.<br />
<br />
Overall, single player has been fun. <br />

<br />
That spell has been bugging me all the time too. It somehow involves a save vs. death - that much is sure. But I have no idea what it was supposed to be...<br />
<br />
Any level 20 wizards/sorcerers around that could help us with this?<br />
<br />
 Edit: Okay, checked it by using the DM client and my D&amp;amp;D Player's Handbook. The spell is called &quot;Weird&quot;, a level 9 version of &quot;Phantasmal Killer&quot;... Edited by: Shadowcross  at: 7/15/02 9:16:50 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
i thought it was a pretty cool ending, great story and stuff imo.<br />
<br />
the ending was VERY expansion-able, too, i thought.  it felt like they made the ending with an expansion in mind, or use of the nwn toolset.  either way i thought it was cool</div></div><hr />

The dragons were tough as hell to me but nothing a couple thousand gold worth of potions didn't fix.  I think the problem was Daelan alwasy attacking the dragon I wasn't no matter what I told him to do.  I hated the end though, I wanted to see more about Aribeth and my &quot;feelings&quot;  and wanted to tell Nasher to give me a home and title in Neverwinter, after all I saved the world it's the least he could do.  And I want that stupid amulet to work..level 26 restriction, that is just way beyond stupid of the desiginers, mistake or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-17-02, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, but I never got actual evidence for him being drugged. *shrug*<br />

I just bribed two people and managed to get him free.</div></div><hr />

I've since looked over the Gamespot spoiler for that section and found that I couldn't have done anyway, as getting it involves casting a healing spell on one of the witnesses.  Seeing as I did all of my healing with potions, there is no way I could have acquitted him without bribery, which I decided not to do.</div></div><hr />

The breath weapon will hit the other dragon, and after a moment of running, they'll begin to attack each other.  You'll be left with a tough silver dragon, but it will usually be injured when it finishes off the other one. Syril - 42nd Level Enchantress<br />

While I got him acquitted the first time, it was a 3-2 decision.  The second time was a 5-0 decision which I believe garnered me a much better reward.  I did have high wisdom during this, which may have opened up more options that others, but I stuck with mentioning the spiking of the drink, and NOT bringing up race issues.  I found not hitting every option was much better in the trial ..<br />

Because I don't keep healing kits on me (I used potions pretty much exclusively), I tried giving him a cure potion but got &quot;You cannot barter with this NPC&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ah well, if I ever play the single player campaign again, I'll know what to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_BD Nightfall</div><div class="date">07-22-02, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was dissapointed that the end was so easy.  At the dragons my henchman (Daelen) died, but I killed both with using only like 1 or 2 potions and Lay Hands.  Then Morag's henchmen could barely touch me and Morag was even weaker...Lvl 16 Paladin- 46AC, 156 HPs, weilding Astral Blade +2.  I have the difficulty set to Very Difficult also.  I dunno, maybe having such a high AC really affected how easy the fights were.</div></div><hr />

fyi aribeth's challenge rating dealy is higher than morag's.  his is 25, aribeth's is 28 with 18 cleric levels and 20 paladin levels.<br />

The two dragon one particularly was trivial since harm has no saving throw...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look, two angry dragons...&quot; Touch... whack... dead... Touch... whack... Dead...<br />
<br />
Just a touch attack and at level 20 I had a  27 attack as a cleric so it's not like you actually miss a whole hell of a lot. <br />
<br />
However, summoning a balor into a room full of badies is fun for the whole family... hearing 'I WILL REND YOUR SOUL' and seeing exp fly by is quite entertaining  . Challenging? No. Amusing? Most certainly.<br />
<br />
The end fight was interesting since I blew a lot of spells during the initial encounter with the cleric and his 6(?) buddies, and wasn't able to rest, recall, or rebuff. That and Dealen got whacked during the first 5 seconds of the final battle. All the sudden I make my saving throw vs. death and he vanishes.. 'Erp!&quot; <br />
<br />
But even at that, it was still pretty simple. I even walked through the sword barrier (didn't realize you had to kill the statue) and only took 201 points of damage. Well, 201 is a lot but I still had some left  . I love my cleric buffs...<br />
