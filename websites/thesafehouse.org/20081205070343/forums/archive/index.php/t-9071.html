<br />
Now, I already have the innate health and stamina regens, but my questions is this:<br />
<br />
Of the three &quot;heal yourself&quot; powers, if you had to pick one, which would it be.  Here are the choices.<br />
<br />
Reconstruction:  This is pretty much a self only regular heal.  I understand that heavily modded it will heal quite alot too.<br />
<br />
Dull Pain: Also heals you, but in addition it increases your maximum hit points.<br />
<br />
Instant Healing: Is actually a toggled ability, when you turn it on it cranks your health regeneration through the roof, though if your stunned or something similar, it shuts down, just like all toggled buffs.  Also understand it drains alot of End.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind however that End will probably not be a problem for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-16-04, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as far as I can tell, instant healing has the same drain as sprint... *not much*, but after deactivating it has a *five minute* recharge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dull pain also has a five minute recharge, but reconstruction is fairly quick, at 30 seconds I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-16-04, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instant Healing is by far the best of the 3, however with that line, your probably gonna want at least 2 of the 3, if not all 3.<br />
<br />
Instant Healing Slotted right can essentially make you into a mini tanker, the heal regen is just that good. Although being longest down the line, it does take a while. There is a really really good Regeneration FAQ floating around the coh boards should be a link on pages 1 - 10 at least *scrapper boards*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you mean by &quot;innate&quot; health and stam regens?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">powers one and three of the regeneration line, fast healing and quick recovery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone done any tests to see just how much 'Dull Pain' gives?<br />
<br />
I've been debating grabbing it for my Tanker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At one point dull pain was a straight % increase, so that the lower your health when you hit it, the less it did.  I don't know if this is still the case, but would assume so.<br />
<br />
Example:  You have 500 of 600 hit points and hit dull pain.  You are temporarily boosted to having 550 of 660 hitpoints.  So, if you have 100 of 600 then you get boosted to 110 of 660, making it a very ineffective heal.  (note these numbers are not exact, I don't remember what the actual % increase of dull pain is)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm sounds like thats one for my list of things to get then :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone know how long the 30% boost lasts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually you should ask the question which of the 3 powers do i want to invest slots into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PsiKoTicK</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the same subject...<br />
<br />
I've got my Martial Arts/Regen scrapper, and was debating putting a power in the health, stamina, etc lines...  will they stack with my innate regen (from my secondary power set) or would they be worthless?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know how long the 30% boost lasts?<br />
<br />
Long enough that with 3 DO charge reductions, i can kep it up roughly 70-80% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">05-18-04, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got Reconstruction last night - I put a &quot;10&quot; generic time redux enhancement in it - and it saved my butt quite a few times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemac Dushae</div><div class="date">05-18-04, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Tanker I bought Dull Pain and use it as my emergency self heal.  It helps out quite a bit with soloing as well, but generally I save it for when the healer in the group let's things get a bit too scary for my own good.<br />
<br />
If you regularly group with either a dedicated healer, or two group healers you prolly won't get much milage out of it.  Now granted, I'm only level 12.  At higher levels it may be a bigger payoff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mercurial</div><div class="date">05-18-04, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something to keep in mind about Dull Pain: It increases your maximum hitpoints.  You knew that already, right?  Let's think about some side-effects:<br />
<br />
1. Healing Rate - Every +health tick gives you 5% of your max hitpoints.  So you will heal 30% faster while Dull Pain is active, and that stacks with other healing powers.<br />
<br />
2. Inspirations - These give back a set percentage of your health bar.  All +HP inspirations will heal 30% more while Dull Pain is active.<br />
<br />
One corollary to the above is: Use Dull Pain early.  Use it before you start burning Healing Inspirations.  This is particularly important if you think you're in trouble.<br />
<br />
For example, suppose the **** hits the fan, and you end up using 3 x +50% HP and 3 x +25% HP (very easy at level 25+ with 15 or 20 slots).  That's +225% of your base hitpoints -- but if you use Dull Pain first, it turns into almost 300%!  In this situation, you would get an &quot;extra&quot; 2/3rds of your unenhanced life bar, for free, because you used Dull Pain first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-18-04, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, let me break it down for you.<br />
<br />
I'm a Katana/regen scrapper.<br />
<br />
I'm taking all 9 Katana powers.<br />
2 Leap powers<br />
3 Concealment Powers<br />
And 3 Fitness powers<br />
<br />
That means I have only 3 powers I can take from my Regen line.  2 of those are already taken for powers 1 and 3, the auto hp and end regens.<br />
<br />
That means I only have one power left to spend in the line, at least until the level limit goes up.<br />
<br />
So I have to pick one of the three.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I like to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">05-19-04, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah basically you get 20 total powers out of 34 available (primary, secondary, power pools)<br />
<br />
Typically you can identify 1 or 2 in your primary that is a duplication of an earlier skill to get better mileage out of power pool or secondaries.<br />
<br />
Also here is alink to the regen FAQ very very helpful.<br />
