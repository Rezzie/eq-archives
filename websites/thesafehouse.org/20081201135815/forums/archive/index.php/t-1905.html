<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-10-03, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly, I really do love you guys for putting up free streaming techno. Makes my day much easier to not fall asleep during. <br />
<br />
But why do you have 7 different channels for Techno Genres when they all amount to the same damn thing? Your Trance is nothing but happy @#%$ house, your hard trance alternates between trance.....and happy @#%$ house. Your Goa-Psy Trance hits the mark......maybe once an hour? Really. The only channel that is even remotely true to it's name is Classical Trance, only because everything you play on it is older than 2 years........and 1/2 isn't even bloody trance!!!<br />
<br />
Do you guys even listen to the mixes you put on before deciding it's &quot;IN YOUR FACE HARDCORE&quot;? Either that, or the DJs you have evaluating need to go back about 3 years and get a clue. Each to their own, enjoy your boppy, over sampled, overly remixed female vocals in with your lame ass beats and obnoxious effects, house. But if you tell me it's Hardcore, find someone who even knows WTF Hardcore sounds like.  &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a big one....a tall drink of water, but I got to tell you, you don't look too bright. I got a son, stupid as a man who bought his stupid at a 2-for-1 sale, and you remind me of him.&quot; -Mr. Nancy</div></div><hr />

However, he's a moron in that respect, plenty of people listen to techno.</div></div><hr />

It is. some does sound like: ''Tra-la-la-la happy tree friends bunnies of love songs'', but then again.. you get the elite when you look hard enough and endure.<br />
