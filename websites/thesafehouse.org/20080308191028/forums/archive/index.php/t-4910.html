<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dippin Daggers</div><div class="date">02-21-02, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres my level 50 goal:<br />
<br />
40 Stealth<br />
39 Thrusting<br />
38 Envenom<br />
39 Critical Strike<br />
34 Dual Wield<br />
<br />
Only think I'm worried about are future revisions to Critical Strike and Envenom, since they hinted they will be working on these skills.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have any info as to what exactly they will be doing to CS and Envenom?  Otherwise, does this look like a good template?  I'm 25 now, so I'm a ways from this goal.</div></div><hr />
