<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">09-15-05, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in Futureshop (Canada's version of Best Buy) on Tuesday trying to get a copy of Cowboy Bebop Remix Volume 1, but unfortunately it looks like we won't get it up here until next week (found it was the same with the GitS:SAC disks - they arrive up here a week after the stated release date), when I noticed a thinpack complete collection for Rune Soldier.  Six disks, 24 episodes (that's 600 minutes of anime), for under $40.<br />
<br />
I hummed and hawed a bit because I don't like buying anime without first checking it out thoroughly, but I remembered the trailer for Rune Soldier on one of my other disks and enjoyed it (it had a catchy theme song), and I thought '24 episodes for under $40? That's a damned good deal for anime'.  I bought it and I'm glad I did, because it's a light-hearted, funny show that's well worth the price.<br />
<br />
The setup is that three female adventurers (an amazon warrior, a thief, and a priestess) are in need of a magician to open a sealed tomb, so they go to try and find a female magician to join their party.  Unfortunately all the other magicians in the city are more interested in reading books than adventuring, and Louie the magician is the only one who will go on the adventure with them.  The problem is that because Louie wants to adventure rather than study and read, he's a really bad magician.  He tries to do the right thing, but he just doesn't think before he actually takes action (like mixing up a paralyzing crystal and an exploding crystal, or trying to cast a sleep spell on zombies), so the results are usually less than stellar.<br />
<br />
While the group could have easily dumped him, things get more complicated when the priestess is told by her god that Louie is her valiant champion and that she must follow him and help him on his adventures.  She is terrified by the thought of Louie as her champion (she imagined a valiant knight in shining armour, not a magician who enjoys running headfirst into battle with fists flailing) but she obeys her god and follows Louie, all the while praying 'This is against my will, this is against my will, this is totally against my will!'  The fact that she follows him even though she knows he's going to get them into trouble (Louie just can't help it) is another funny aspect.  When he shows flashes of true heroism, they're usually tempered by either how he performed his heroics, or that he was the one responsible for creating the situation in the first place.  But with Melissa tied to Louie by the order of her god (totally against her will, of course), the rest have little choice but to accept Louie as the fourth member of their group.<br />
<br />
The english voice cast is excellent, and in an anime like this where jokes are thrown around and a stale performance can ruin the whole thing, it's nice to see that everyone brought their A game.  If you want a fantasy adventure series with good characters, a good sense of humour, and the ocassional touch of seriousness, Rune Soldier would be an excellent choice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">09-15-05, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah i watched it before ( sub ) <br />
good anime  :thumb</div></div><hr />

That's another thing I like about the series; they could've used the 'harem card' but they didn't.  None of the girls fawn over him (Louie's magician friend, Ila, does though), and he doesn't fawn over any of them (though there is one elf he likes who appears a few times).  They're just adventurers, three of whom happen to be female.<br />
<br />
I'm on the fifth disks right now and looking back, aside from one episode where Merril (the thief) is mistaken for someone else and almost gets married, both the warrior and thief could've been written in as male characters.  Rune Soldier is kind of like the 'anti-Najica' (Najica: Blitz Tactics is an anime which could have been very good had they concentrated less on fanservice and panty shots, and more on story and plot).</div></div><hr />

Great deals abound. Central Park Media (CPM) has been repricing most of their catalog to be much cheaper.<br />
<br />
And as for fantasy anime, Scrapped Princess is a good one. Well except for that one little thing.</div></div><hr />

Funny you should mention that, because Rune Soldier Louie happens to be set in the same universe. :)</div></div><hr />

Yup.  I own the Full Metal Panic! thinpack, Rune Soldier thinpack, Najica thinpack, and my Noir thinpack should be arriving in the mail tomorrow.  I also had an order for the RahXephon thinpack but the order was cancelled after three months for being unavailable.<br />
<br />
I like the fact that the thinpacks both cost less and take up a lot less shelf space.  My Neon Genesis Evangelion collection (eight disks, 26 episodes) takes up more space than my Rune Soldier and Full Metal Panic! thinpacks combined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-15-05, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beware that with the exception of three thinpacks (noir, full metal panic, rahxephon) they are stripped of whatever extras they had.</div></div><hr />
