Quote: B: In regards to PvP there has been a big move to address PvP in EverQuest of late.  Rule changes, new servers etc.  Is there a specific reason why this has happened all of a sudden?<br />
<br />
JB: There's a couple of different reasons.  We've always been marginally dissatisfied with the success of PvP in EverQuest.  EverQuest was designed as a PvE game, and adapting it to PvP, as I'm sure the players would tell you, has left something to be desired on a couple of fronts.  We have been aware of that for a long time and its been our list for issues to address.  We want to put up another server, and also explore new rule sets.  We had a meeting at the last fan faire and picked PvP players minds there for ideas on how to improve it.  Coupled with some code changes, we can expand the RP aspect of PvP. This has made the time right for launching a new PvP server, and after it goes live we might even set up another server with different rules again, such as no common language between teams.  There's lots of things to explore.<br />
<br />
B: With the addition of yet another deity, will we ever be seeing religion play a more important part of EverQuest?<br />
<br />
JB:  In fact you will see that on the next PvP server.<br />
<br />
So it looks like the (first) new server is probably going to be deity-based teams. And there may be more than one server going up...<br />
<br />
Oh, and on a non-pvp note:<br />

Quote: B: What other classes can the Vah Shir be besides Beastlords?<br />
<br />
JB:  They should be able to be tentatively a Rogue, Bard, Warrior, possibly Shaman.<br />
