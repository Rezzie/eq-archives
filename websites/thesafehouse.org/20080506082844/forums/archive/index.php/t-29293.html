I've been everywhere looking for them and I've had no luck whatsoever.<br />

Been all around the coast of Tanvu looking for Devrin Blodrik. No sign of him!<br />
<br />
Many Thanks</div></div><hr />

If you go up the stairs you'll come across a room with doors to the sides, most of them leading to bedrooms. The guy you're looking for is in one of the bedrooms to the right as you come up the stairs. If the door is locked, try moving into another bedroom and using the back door from the balcony.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just Talok Windlow in the ruins of VT to find<br />
<br />
The area where you guys saw him? Is it much further down from the large open circular area<br />
<br />
Normally I would invis down to get him but those damn mosquitos can see you a mile off<br />
<br />
Does crouching while invis'd have any benefit?</div></div><hr />
