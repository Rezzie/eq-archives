<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_BERTEY</div><div class="date">06-09-02, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok well I have got the stupid idea in my head that im actually going to be worth a damn, and in total idiot fashion im not even going to stick to the tried and true means of being gimped! Im going to devise my own new level of gimpness and make my assassin killer shade=P<br />
<br />
This is all based on the idea that shades get that insta shout and... damnit I want it to be useful! So Iv based a whole char around the idea that im gona be able to use it on another assassin and put us both into straight melee.<br />
<br />
The only thing I need to know is.. from experienced people.. which line has the better styles? Im talking about blades vs CD. I am gona raise my dual up pretty high, and my blades will be high for the damage.. but which should I look for for styles?<br />
<br />
My general idea for level 50 *yes 50* is this.. base mind you=P<br />
<br />
Stealth-37<br />
Envenom-38 *aiming for 47 with bonuses asap*<br />
CS-10 *Just to help against casters with bladeturn*<br />
CD-37 *if I don't find out that blade styles suck and I need the cd styles*<br />
Blades-44 *for the 3rd in the use anytime chain*<br />
<br />
My reasoning is flawed but it works in my mind=P so just tell me with is better style wise CD or Blades and ill leave you alone and go be gimped=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AGLuhowy</div><div class="date">06-18-02, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, stealth should be 36 and envenom 35, cause you can get those to 50 with items and realm bonus easy, and maybe even keep them lower when spellcrafting comesout.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the 44 style in blades is the 3rd in a block chain.  They changed it, like along time ago.  Use after dancing which is after horizon which is after blocking.<br />
<br />
39 in CD is the second in the anytime chain.  Use it.<br />
<br />
Dump the rest into critical strike and hope you might have enough for perferated artery.</div></div><hr />
