<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_mengelt</div><div class="date">06-26-03, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldn't find previous posts on this subject... I read somewhere you can mq for the cazic quill (have someone turn in the kedge robe, than you turn in the other 3), and I was wondering if anyone else has done this? It would be a shame if the information I read was assumed and I lost the robes. Have any of you done it?<br />
<br />
Also, I assume there's no reason why I couldn't do the cazic quill part of the quest before I even kill the general?... It's pretty much unrelated so I can go ahead and do that now If I have the robes correct? The only reason I see not to is that one of the dark elfs by the general might drop the robes i have.<br />
<br />
Is it pretty common to get the kedge robe when you kill the genral and the dark elfs once?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I have participated in 4 clearings and 7 general kills and have never seen the quill drop.  The robe only dropped once, off the coercer I believe.  I personally would wait until you have the general kill down just in case you get lucky; you can save yourself quite a few plats that way.  I was just fortunate that a guildmate happened to have a kedge robe for MQ and did it for me for free.</div></div><hr />

Just trying to clarify that as well I have all 3 other than kedge but if I could find a friend with the kedge might be able to persuade them to MQ it with me.</div></div><hr />

I purchased the Robe of the Kedge off a kind soul and had him turn that in to Villinus the Small first, then I turned in the other 3 robes... presto...Cazic Quill.<br />
<br />
Good luck in finding a cheap MQ and good luck in completing your epic. :)<br />
