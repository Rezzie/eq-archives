<br />
&quot;The latest update to CoH has been reverted due to unforeseen problems resulting in some powers not working correctly. <br />
<br />
Because we are wary of the perception of changing game functionality without notifying the players, we are reverting this update to analyze the issue. <br />
<br />
I am sorry for the miscommunication on this issue and pledge that update notes, etc. will be expeditiously posted in the future. &quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience. <br />

Can't say enough about dealing with fubar patches in other games that take days or weeks to be addressed.</div></div><hr />

When they hit powers like this, you'd think we'd get to repick or something...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but the devs have proven repeatedly they aren't out to nerf and gut things. I still say they have the best CS and most community minded devs anywhere.</div></div><hr />

As we work to get the bugs out of the current patch, I wanted to comment on a couple of issues.<br />
<br />
First, we will have a test server, where the public can sample upcoming changes. As Gaffer said, we were a victim of our own success here and needed everything we had for live operations.<br />
<br />
Second, the changes in the last patch are still going in. We've playtested through the changes thoroughly. Why did we make the changes? The #1 reason is always balance. We don't want to make any power - or power set - absolutely vital for &quot;maximum&quot; leveling speed. The power set Super Speed should offer overall no greater advantage than Super Leap or Leadership or...well, you get the point. Hasten had become &quot;the&quot; power to get because it was just too darned powerful. Of course, there's lots of other issues that go into balance, but that's a major factor.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, respec is coming. As some have already noted, it's mentioned as part of one of our &quot;trials&quot; in the Strategy guide. That didn't make it into release, as we'd hoped, but it will be in a soonish update. There's no switch that can just add respec into the next update; some work needs to be done on it.<br />
<br />
Changes to powers, villains, rewards are inevitable in a MMORPG. We try to minimize the impact of these changes, but sometimes certain things need to happen. This time, too many communication errors occurred; I deeply apologize for the lack of patch notes (that's not going to happen again). No one should suffer a stealth nerf. And when a Test server is up, some things will be disseminated somewhat earlier.<br />
<br />
Thanks for playing and making City of Heroes the success that it is!</div></div><hr />

That, above and beyond the fact that their game is freaking awesome, makes me go all warm and glowy inside.</div></div><hr />
