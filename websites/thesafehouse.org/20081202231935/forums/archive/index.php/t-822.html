<br />
I'm a sucker for haunted house stories (yes, I'm including hospitals in there too).  And I'm a big SK fan.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zulian</div><div class="date">03-03-04, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to watch it, but they had to put it up against Smallville/Angel (Can't remember which one it was conflicting with, but it was one of them).  Rosered was pretty cool, wish they'd picked a different night/time for this one (According to TiVo they aren't replaying it, at least anytime soon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vindicor</div><div class="date">03-04-04, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a series, but it's got a finite length.  It's thirteen episodes long.  Kind of like a mega-mini-series.<br />
<br />
The first and thirteenth episodes are two hours long, with the others only one hour in duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Yrion</div><div class="date">03-04-04, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thirteen episodes is also known as a &quot;season&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">03-04-04, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched it, but I missed the first few minutes.  What is the hospital supposed to be built on?<br />
<br />
You can definitely tell a lot of this was inspired by Stephen King's real life.  I figured he'd make a story relating to his accident.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vindicor</div><div class="date">03-04-04, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thirteen episodes is a &quot;season&quot; only for mid-season replacements and cable series.<br />
<br />
Kingdom Hospital is based on a Danish miniseries of the same name by filmmaker Lars Van Trier.  King saw it and liked it, and offered to &quot;personalize&quot; it and remake it for ABC.  Van Trier is still an executive producer on it.<br />
<br />
The hospital was built over a mine (I think it was a mine, at least) where an accident claimed the lives of several children.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkefang</div><div class="date">03-04-04, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kingdom Hospital is loosely based on the story of Waverly Hills Tuberculosis Hospital, off Dixie Highway in Louisville, KY.  It was a place where they sent people for treatment for tuberculosis and mental illnesses in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  The place obviously had an extremely high fatality rate, and ghost stories started circulating.<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, the original hospital burnt down in about the 1920s, and another hospital was rebuilt around the 1960s.  However, patients wouldn't go to the place, because it was supposedly haunted.  One especially freaky thing there was that within two or three years of being built, the building had deteriorated so badly that it looked like it was 100 years old.  I think it ended up being a nursing home, but was shut down because the staff were beating the people living there.<br />
<br />
Kids from my high school used to go there on Halloween and sneak around the building.  If I had known this story then, there's no way I would have gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">03-04-04, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never even heard about the show.<br />
Its about a haunted hospital?  Sounds like something id like to watch too.  But if its on opposite Smallville/Angel then it wouldent bother me much to miss it.<br />
Is the rest of the series going to be on a different timeslot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vindicor</div><div class="date">03-04-04, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, but it looks like Angel won't be granted the reprieve that Buffy got.  So Kingdom Hospital may not have any competition for genre airtime.<br />
<br />
Quote:There's a resignation to [co-executive producer Jeff] Bell's voice that immediately tells you he doesn't believe the outlook for the show's future is good.  &quot;If there's any shot at all, it's at UPN.  That's going to happen strictly on financial reasons for them.&quot;  If UPN wants the series, the clock is ticking, according to Bell.  &quot;I believe there was a ten-day window to the offer and I think that's coming up but I don't know the end date to that.  It seems like a long shot.  I think we all took it as we are cancelled for next year and if something else happens, fantastic but we've been 'bubble boys' for so many years now so to actually have some knowledge that it's ending and sort of treat it as such is in some ways ... at least we know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I know it is going to be canceled at the end of the season.  But that dosnt help for watching the limited 13 episode show that is on this season.  Unless they rerun it next season as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vindicor</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are only seven or eight more episodes of Angel, if I'm not mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I'm guessing that some of you watched kingdom hospital and actually want to see more of it?<br />
<br />
One question, Why?!?!  In my opinion the best acting in the whole 2 hour long disaster was the CGI anteater, and he wasn't so great. - Nymm<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More the story I'm interested in than the acting.</div></div><hr />
