<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Faegin Darkfang</div><div class="date">06-18-00, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was running thru North Ro today, on my way back from meeting with Ortallius the Orc in South Ro (where, incidentally, he bestowed upon me the Burning Rapier after many trials), when I hear rumors that some greenhorn folks were asking if anyone can remove Dorn from their his Dervish camp.<br />
<br />
Well, I was feeling very frisky after completing such a long and arduous quest and thought to myself &quot;What the heck?  I just got an AMAZING weapon... and Dorn bullied me WAY TOO MANY times in my younger days... IT'S TIME TO GET SOME PAYBACK!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
So I skip over, sneak into camp, and introduce ole' Dorn's spinal column to three feet of gleaming hot steel kissed by Solusek Ro Himself.  Battle ensued with many a viscious blow landed upon me from the Indigo Brother, turned Dervish Cutthroat.  But catching Dorn a choice kick in his unmentionables (these furry feet of mine do have their uses sometimes), the villain turned tail and ran away, allowing me the opportunity to skewer his kidneys, not once but twice more!  Cursing me with threats of retribution from his Brothers in Neriak, the bane of my younger days lay at my feet dying.  And that's when I got a serious surprise!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, out of the sand near where Dorn lay bleeding, a dark elf spy appeared, and began to assault me with his dark powers.  He began blasting me with all manner of eldritch and deathly spells, but my blades were keen and I struck him like lightning.  Soon he was running from me across the desert, and he too fell at my furry feet with a hole in his back.  And yet again, I had a surprise!<br />
<br />
From out of the spy's jacket, a small black widow, called a mite, leapt forth and scurried across the desert.  Stunned in the extreme (for only a madman would keep venomous bugs in his pockets), I pursued the mite and engaged it in combat.  To my surprise, this was no ordinary spider, for it too began to cast dark spells at me.  But steel once again won the day over necomantic arts, and the mite too met it's end on the sands.  <br />
<br />
From the mite's body, I pulled a strange book... it is called the Tome of Charasis.  It is written in Dark Elven, so I was unable to translate little... I hope to learn more of the language so as to give the book a full read.  <br />
<br />
I wonder, has anyone heard rumor of this strange Tome?  Have I stumbled onto another quest?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually my friend it is written in Iksar, not dark elf, so you will need to travel a LONG ways away to discover it's secrets.<br />
