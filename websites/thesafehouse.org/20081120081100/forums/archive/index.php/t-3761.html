Finished 5 LDON Adventures in Miragul in the last few days and we had 0 named in them.<br />
I did notice that we had more chest/tables/barrels then we usually do, up to 4 in an adventure.<br />
They were all slaughter/collection missions and we got close enough to all the end rooms for a ranger to track.<br />
Anyone else seeing anything like this?<br />

Did 3 Mir and 1 Mistmoore and we had 0 named in the whole dungeon. And no you don't need a ranger if you have SoS and 5 mins to run the dungeon. Then on monday I did 1 Takish adventure and it had 3 named in it.<br />

It's just random.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, they spawn there too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In most every Assasinate mission I get an extra named or two.  Sometimes 3.<br />
<br />
Not sure why, but Slaughter seems to have less named for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a guess, but it maybe due to the fact that slaughter missions are jokes and you only need to clear like half the dungeon to win and are therefore less likely to come across named even on track.  From my personal experience, there is an even chance for named to spawn in any dungeon theme or type of adventure.  It really is just random.</div></div><hr />

nope, completly random... An assassinate I had in Mriagual had 4 spawn spots, 3 were nameds one was the boss. Unfortunatly they each dropped the same thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Windaria</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've run well over 25 slaughter missions now.  In that total we've seen 2 named.  And we've tracked the entire dungeon each time...  believe me my group does not leave named up.<br />
<br />
We average about 1 loot named per assasination, and have seen 2-3 at times.  Occasionally we get zero, but if we run 4 assasinate missions in a night, we'll end up with 4+ loot items.  <br />
<br />
Unless someone can say &quot;We get a named on every slaughter, or every other!&quot; ... I think they are less common on slaughter.</div></div><hr />
