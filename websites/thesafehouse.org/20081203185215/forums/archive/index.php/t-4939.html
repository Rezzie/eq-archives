<br />
I think that your weapon skill level is compared to your targets level when partly determining what the target cons to you (or your weapon.)<br />
<br />
Why? Well for one reason I find it very hard to do max damage on grays with my piercing skill (which is very low), I can do it, but the mob needs to be very gray, like level 1 to 15. <br />
<br />
With my Large Weapon skill I can sometimes hit for max damage on greens, and anything that has just turned gray its almost a gaurentee.<br />
<br />
My large weapon skill is 50 or 51 depending on the weapon and my level is 45. I regularlly kill oranges in RVR. The only thing that I can think of is that my skill is much more important than just for determining damage output and variance, it pushes my average damage up by huge amounts especially on grays-yellows.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ciardha Sidhe</div><div class="date">03-05-02, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely worth finding out more about.  That would make sense.<br />
<br />
Trying to piece that together...  Skill level (with bonuses) determines WeaponSkill.  WeaponSkill and AF seem to be on the same scale.  Maybe the difference between the attackers WeaponSkill and the target's AF determines one of the maximum damage settings (separate and usually lower than the weapon's damage cap).<br />
<br />
Assuming AF scales with mob level, which would make sense.  Consistently hitting high purples for 7-10 damage is probably the same function.<br />
<br />
Anyone want to pull out a non-spec weapon on your next high purple fight and see if you get the same damage?<br />
<br />
If the display of Weapon Damage isn't just a bug that displays a 0 instead of a decimel (which was hinted at on the Herald), then Weapon Damage might also be on the same scale, and worked in somehow. Ciardha Sidhe, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br />

Is anyone else EXCEPTIONALLY annoyed that we are forced into these kind of discussions because Mythic won't tell us how it works?  It's frustrating.<br />
<br />
I (foolishly) bought one of the Prima Strategy guides.  One thing it says about infiltrators is that:<br />
<br />
Quote: It's not so much a matter of maxing out any one thing, as it is keeping everything as high as possible.<br />
<br />
Maybe that's not a bad way to work your specs.  WHO KNOWS??? ARGH! Aurra Sing - 37 Infiltrator<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">03-06-02, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, being one of the people that contributed to the strategy guide I would say it is garbage. <br />
<br />
Basicly the Prima people asked on the pen boards for people to interview and then they compiled the info into a book. A ton of it is wrong. Especially with the assassins. The book went to print 3 days after the assassins were put into the game. That means people had about 2 days to figure out the class (then a day for formatting and editting) before the book went off to the printers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Brandyn Aquilius</div><div class="date">03-06-02, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep! It's garbage.  The only thing I still pick it up for is to see if i can get an idea of MOB levels... which I usually don't bother with anyway.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is that even thought it pretty much sucks, the thing about keeping your specs (assassin) as high as you can, may well be a good idea.<br />

I just wish we knew for sure how things worked. Aurra Sing - 37 Infiltrator<br />

I don't know because it does say that there is benefit form going over those points...<br />
<br />
Why wouldn't they recommend maxing bow out? Go to 50 with bow, and 63 with items/realm rank.  Sunthas Bayne<br />
