- the tier 2 recipes are based on similar name/similar effect tier 1 recipes by swaping amber for mercury and adding one ingredient (we actually found the tier one first and then went for the tier 2 one for the sketch quest, greatly limiting the numbers of combines needed)<br />
- all poison ingredients that are new have a best price around 6 p 3 g; that might give a starting point for finding new recipes<br />
- if this pattern holds by around tier 4 you will need the marble mortar, which needs a pottery GM (or close) to produce in quantities (sucess rates around 50%). Also these are containers, so you wont find them in the bazaar on traders. Shamu Whitewale &amp;lt;br&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_RanjaInno</div><div class="date">10-30-02, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... that would so suck.<br />
I mean yeah, I had fun doing the vial, seal and sketch quests, but that was in the excited spirit of discovering new grounds. If the maximum we get out of the whole work are the current tier2 poisons, then it will most probably not be worth the hassle for those who start after us. Also: Why would we need the black marbled MP if there's no tier 3/4 - GM pottery just for 4 more slots, i kinda can't believe that.<br />

<br />
because folks lose 4 slots to carry a motar and pestle(which sucks ass with the amount of various gear I carry).. <br />
with the 10 slot one, you lose nothing and still have the functionality of a motar and pestle. <br />
for starters this is why I'd want it, not to mention undiscovered poisons that might use 7 or more ingrediants Atus<br />

Only tier 1 and 2 were put into the game the higher end ones are not put into the game until they are actually found/quested, thus no looking at spelldat beyond the initial tease.<br />
<br />
I do so hope this is the case.<br />
<br />
I have come across 3 nodrop poison-ish sounding goodies so far in PoP and I have them in the bank. (i.e. Terror Matriarch Venom Sack etc..) My theory is that 10 of these nodrop comps will be found and combined in the Black Mortar and produce some recipe or quest componant that may yet open a new chapter.<br />
