And that can take time.  It'd be more assinine to bring em down for twelve hours then put the same software back on.  Also, database conversion may be part of the update, which can take a while if their fixes involve it. Brelkor the Blackhammer, The Masta Back Stabba, retired rogue<br />

<br />
But they have changed the game somewhat. I have also noticed some odd lag and problems and  pets not following orders.  <br />
