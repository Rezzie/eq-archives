<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Thral McMarrin</div><div class="date">03-26-02, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Shadowblade is currently level 22 with the following stats:<br />
<br />
Level 22<br />
Crit Strike 21 +1<br />
Axe 18 +1<br />
Stealth 5 +2 (all autotrained)<br />
Everything else 1<br />
Lots of training points <br />
<br />
I'm thinking of starting to train Stealth at 24 for Battleground use.  At 24 I hope to have the following<br />
<br />
Level 24<br />
Crit Strike 21 +3<br />
Axe 18 <br />
Stealth 22+2<br />
Envenom 2<br />
<br />
Is this a good mix or should I re-adjust?<br />
Should I skip Battlegrounds 20-24 and get the extra autotrain for 28?  Seems like it would help a lot to have 25 natural stealth for climb walls at 29.<br />
<br />
Please advise and thank you in advance!<br />

That's how far I autotrained.  True, you can probably wait till 28, it's not that hard, but it's a nice reward for your efforts.  You should have +3 or +4 in axe if you have Njessi's axe.  You probably can't get +3 in crit strike items without twinking.  Otherwise it looks fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Thral McMarrin</div><div class="date">03-26-02, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I got a pair of gloves (forget name) that add +3 to Crit Strike.  However, they are currently blue.  I got a pair of gloves last night that are +1 to crit and are red.  i'm thinking for RvR I might use the +3 to crit gloves even if they are grey to me... heck, if I get seriously hit in the hands, I'm probably going down anyway.</div></div><hr />

I would say don't your waste your time slogging through the mud of another low assassin for the sake of BG RvR but hey, to each his own if you have the free time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Veloci</div><div class="date">04-10-02, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same +3 gloves and they are blue as well, I have however noticed that in orange armor my AF is capped without the gloves.  Taking that into account wearing them for RvR is a no brainer Veloci Raptor <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Broombilda</div><div class="date">04-11-02, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One easy thing to do in order to see if you really care if the gloves are blue/green/grey.  Notice how much AF you have on the stats page, take off the gloves, check how much AF went down.  An even better test is if you have orange gloves, check out the difference between your grey ones and those.  The first thing you will notice is that gloves contribute very little to effective AF.  IMHO they contribute so little to effective AF that you shouldn't look at the color at all, only at the stats they give you.  The same goes for boots and to a lesser degree, hats.<br />

<br />
With the 24 template you had... you will simply own on the BG. Its almost identical to mine and I had a blast out there. <br />
Me and my guildmate are specc'd that way and we just slaughtered out there. Oddly enough, my nights out there with my guildmate were the best times I have had in DAoC thusfar.</div></div><hr />
