<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xaxxx</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm not really prepared to ask my questions properly. I'm at work and don't have my Character sheets.<br />
<br />
Basicaly I've been trying to decide what paths my Rogue should take. So I've been rolling up lvl 20 Rogues and play testing them in specially created mods.<br />
<br />
Even though I've studied the manual and the 3ed Players Handbook, I'm still not sure I'm making the best choices for the Rogue I want - which btw I want to play more the assasin role. Here are some concerns. <br />
<br />
Spending the initial 30 points: I've been putting 16 points in Int and 16 in Dex. The rest I've experimented with between Const and Str - favoring Str in most cases. Why so high Int? For the extra points as I lvl. This allows me to max out most all of the skill abilities I want. But is this worth it?<br />
<br />
Feats: I definately want to Dual Wield. I've been choosing Ambi, Two Handed Weap Fighting, Improved Two Handed Weap, Weap Finesse, Weap Prof ShortSword, Weap Prof Dagger, Crit Strike, Improved Crit Shortsword. I can't remember if there were more.<br />
<br />
Weaps: Should I bother with Exotic weaps? Right now I'm just using a shortsword and dagger (dagger in the offhand).<br />
<br />
Any tips and or suggestions are greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I take it you're a halfling? Otherwise you could use larger weapons without penality, too.<br />
<br />
Feats look good basically. Mostly my setup.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say that a high INT is that good for NWN - it might be more efficient for P&amp;amp;P D&amp;amp;D 3rd, but in this game you will be mostly fighting, so higher STR and CON is an advantage. The skill points you get with an average INT (modifier 0) should be enough to keep most skills you might need at a fairly high level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xaxxx</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Halfling. As for the Int. I've been leaning that way by taking note of bonuses on higher end gear. I've noticed there are alot of +gear for the rogue'sh skills. This should allow me to drop some Int for Str or Con yet still keep my other skills high through bonus gear. <br />
<br />
What about weapons? Are my best choices the Short swords and Daggers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm doing pretty well with rapiers. Combine with improved crit and you'll be getting a threat almost half of the combat rounds.<br />
<br />
I would consider a high Charisma. Persuade is very useful, as it gets you into a lot of other classes quests and generally makes your life easier, and Taunt absolutely rocks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say yes.. but it's mostly personal preference.<br />
<br />
But considering the fact that one of the best &quot;custom-made&quot; magic weapon in the solo game is a short-sword, I'd say it's a good choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xaxxx</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oddly enough for my assasin Rogue, I've been droping Persuasion some if not completely for other skills. Interesting. As for Taunt. Why do you like it so much?<br />
<br />
I tried wielding a rapier and could only use it as a two handed weap. I assume this is because I'm a halfling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, stick to short sword and dagger.<br />
<br />
As for Taunt - I can't say anything on it. Didn't use it once in the game from level 1-20. *shrug*<br />
And Persuation - It's not that important.. I think I had 10 point in it at level 20.. which was enough for almost everything. Often enough you can restart the conversation and try again anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Flapjax</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I will add is choose wisely... not all modules will be like the NWN SP campaign.  If your intent is to play SP modules, most are designed around combat skills, and as Shadowcross mentioned you can repeat conversations and forcefully &quot;spill the beans&quot; from NPCs.  On MP modules, ESPECIALLY DM-driven, campaigns you might get one shot at persuassion and you fail the check your @#%$ out of luck (if the DM so chooses).  Hence major info-bytes or quest paths might be missed.  Once they script ways to &quot;hide&quot; the highlight obect feature (used by pressing tab) the same will hold true of important features or objects (e.g., hidden doors or a quest item under the leaf litter).  The DM will give you one-chance to pass your skill check.  So know your module... and choose wisely.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xaxxx</div><div class="date">07-12-02, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed.  The good thing about NWN is that if I do roll my character wrong, I didn't waste alot of time and money, aka EQ/Daoc.  =)<br />
<br />
Over the last two nights I did make alot of progress though. Even though I was wanting to go with more of an assasin type, I think being well rounded will play better.<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />

and you can keep disarm/unlock stuff repeatidly in SP. NPCs will give same chat text pretty much if you re-engage them in conversation.<br />
<br />
I'm using a rapier &amp;amp; short sword crafted for me in chap 1 (don't want to give out too much info - as it is not a spoiler thread)<br />
<br />
I have a special mace for undead - they are immune to *cough* certain attacks.<br />
<br />
I went with swashbuckler, so I get some tailored leveling and I have not been disappointed!<br />
<br />
I am at end of chap.2 - but the use of magic us rogues get is very handy!!!  <br />
<br />
I RP it as: Loreleli's father was a great mage, so she has been around magic her whole life and learned to use some of it!<br />
<br />
As I am low HP ( 67 w/o gear), I took the feat for half damage, I forget what it is called. It has really helped a lot!</div></div><hr />
