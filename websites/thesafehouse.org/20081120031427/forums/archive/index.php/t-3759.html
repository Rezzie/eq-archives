<br />
My guild has beat him once but seem to be having troubles now.<br />
<br />
question one:<br />
<br />
We always seem to finish the kings with 10-15 minutes to spare, which is enough but we'd like to maximize time for bert himself. Currently we kill in middle till 1st king then we go from room to room dispatching kings, ench target adds (which is rather hard considering they're on top of eachother) then MA goes in and CC tries to lock down asap, can be rather nasty at times. So how can we maximize time for bert himself?<br />
<br />
question two: and probably a stupid one :P<br />
<br />
last 4 tries we've wiped to bert himself due to the friggin adds in center room, can you pull the adds without aggro'ing bertox? or bert without aggro'ign adds? we have NP with bert himself its the friggin adds that keep killin us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lindianae</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only had 2 goes at bert so far. Lost the first, but the next day won the second easily. We stay in the centre room the entire encounter and everything gets pulled in by monks. We don't kill the stuff that spawns in the centre room at all we have chanters mezz them the entire fight. Best way to know if they are room spawn or not is to charm and shrink them first up. Then only kill stuff thats not shrunk. This means of course theres no adds when bert himself spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_lenaic12</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok one other question<br />
<br />
We've considering setting it up so we end in east king room (so bertox is just down the ramp after king dies) then pulling bert up to east king room. However we were a bit worried of a few things. Ive heard bert's aggro range is fairly small but could it be big enough to aggro someone if they were near the ramp if king died<br />
<br />
Also allthough bert's aggro range is small his melee range is huge so would he even come up the darn ramp or just sit below the ramp while attacking MA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_dugannw</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We stay in the center room and kill everything that enters, monks/fders pull kings to center room, until last king, we charge that one so we arent in the room when Bert spawns.  By the time we kill last king there are usually a couple adds back in the room, we move back down in room, dispatch the adds then engage Bert, we havent had agro off Bert pulling the adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bert's aggro range is less than half the size of the center room.  We kill the last King practically under his nose and you can pull the repops stacking up next to the zone out pillar without aggro'ing him.  I suspect blowing those away right before pulling Bertox might help your adds problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_patofnaud</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also if you are fighting up in the side rooms, any AE (Bard song included) can aggro Puslings up on the 1st floor that tend to warp down to the center at the wrong time. Been there done that. <br />
<br />
So we only let pullers go up ramps and fight everything down bottom. Edited by: patofnaud  at: 10/15/03 8:12 am</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_GukMonster</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trick to this script is to only pull enough trash to spawn the Kings, and each King can be pulled solo.<br />
<br />
If you are camped in the NW corner, you don't aggro Bert when he pops.<br />
<br />
Commando style is something we have never done, so can't really comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Yenil Lenin</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What kind of DPS does Bert himself dishout?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sorran</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know exact numbers, but Bert's DPS is considerable - he also rampages like crazy. You need to have a very solid rampage tank and rampage healers. On the plus side, he has very, very low hitpoints, and if you can get him positioned and stable, he should die in under 2 minutes. If your rampage tank dies early, you are in for a world of hurt as he will chew through any non-plate tank in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
As for the event in general, we've always moved from room to room killing 1 or 2 kings at each area. We don't bother splitting the adds from each king - we just pull each set of kings and adds once, mez the adds and drop the king, then clear up the trash. As for Bert himself, we kill him in one of the side areas (east side somewhere I think). I don't know anything about it, but our pullers never seem to have any trouble splitting him from any adds before bringing him to the raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_RainjahBoy</div><div class="date">10-16-03, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we used to find a corner (sw i believe) in the center room and ae the whole ring. this usually spawned the kings inbetween repops and let us get to bert about 1:10 into the event and everyone up half a bar of xp. also wed clear the middle one last time and then pull and corner pin him</div></div><hr />

<br />
another warrior with ~ 1400 ac at the time took on the order of 1800 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ginlan</div><div class="date">10-17-03, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When bert pops we just let the adds pile up on the one side and engage bert on the other side. If someone agro's  the adds we continue on bert as he has @#%$ for HP and the adds depop anyhow when he dies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've also done it from center.<br />
<br />
Both work, but I find commando more fun personally.<br />
<br />
As for the adds, you can split the adds from Bert pretty easily.  Then it's just you and the big man himself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Slartibartfast</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Charm the adds in center room. They make a short fight<br />
even shorter. <br />
<br />
Bert's DPS is considerable, do not underestimate it. His<br />
melee range and rampage range are HUGE. Setting rampage<br />
at engage is critical. Heavy plate melee should all be<br />
tapping him once upon inc, before any heals land. This<br />
way if rampage tank should go down, you aren't losing<br />
clerics to rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Khrokhro</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do it the commando way.<br />
<br />
Start ring, kill 42 mobs, king1 pops.<br />
For each king send a DA bard agro everything  and a MT on the king 5 sec after this should let your MT live and give some time to control the adds. Once dead rush to next room dragging the not yet rezed &quot;I didn't turn autoattack off on enrage&quot; dualwielders and the druids that had a &quot;lucky&quot; crit with NI.<br />
<br />
You can pull center room before doing last king, you'll have less adds to charm.<br />
<br />
we usually complete it between 75 and 90 min.<br />
<br />
The fun part is, for each of our success on Bertoxx we have wiped once on him, rezed in a hurry, pulled him with a half/buffed half oom raid and killed him  .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously...fight is so short, we've never bothered with a ramp tank-like a few less pallies are gonna make any difference</div></div><hr />

<br />
1100 dps sounds a bit high to me since Xegony's dps was only 900 when we did her last.<br />
<br />
1800 dps sounds even more insane unless your tank had very low end gear, even then I am not sure a Tier 2 god could put out that much dps and be considered balanced.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Slartibartfast</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go tank AoW and parse it, then tank Blazzax and parse<br />
that. You will see that where a mob is has nothing to do<br />
with its attack rating. Bert DPS being higher than Xegony<br />
does not surprise me at all, Xegony has a low attack<br />
rating with a highish max hit, like most elemental mobs.<br />
Except for Fennin of course, his attack rating and DB<br />
are quite high.<br />
<br />
Bert has extremely high melee DPS, again, do not <br />
underestimate him just because of where he is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Brudal</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So are you confirming 1100-1800 dps on Bert? Or does that still sound high to you because it sounds way off to me. At the point where you would be trying Bert I can't see how your tanks could take that kinda dps without a small army of healers if in fact those numbers are accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sequeli</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bert hits his max hit ALOT.  I wouldn't dought he is that high dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kalledar</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One major factor: Xegony is mostly slowable. Bertoxxulous is not slowable. Bert definetely hits harder on average than Xegony, too. Bert hits for max very often (1900 max or near that). Xegony hits for a lot less than max most of the time. Hell, I'm a shaman and I survived a full round of Xegony melee with only taking 600 damage (several misses, one hit). Bertoxxulous has always killed me in 2 seconds or less if I manage to get aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gallerus</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, if you look at log of xegony with slow on she can still dish out major ass beat - she just got crazy low attack so rarely hits max for multiple times in a 1 round or in back to back rounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arafain</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bert and Fro are similar in that they almost always hit for max or near it.  I've rarely faced a round of Fennin melee that didn't have at least two 2k+ hits in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_GukMonster</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bert's DPS is that high, in the 1600 region but this is offset by his incredibly low hit points. Even on our first kill he died in under 45 seconds.<br />
<br />
Just burn him down quick.</div></div><hr />
