<br />
WESTWOOD, MA – May 10, 2006 – Turbine, Inc. announced today plans for a range of expanded player features and content, including more solo-friendly game play, to be included in the second content module for DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS ONLINE™: Stormreach™ (DDO), the hit game that has quickly become one of the fastest-growing MMOGs (massively multiplayer online games) in North America. DDO is based on the world-renowned DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS® brand franchise from Wizards of the Coast, Inc., a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. (NYSE: HAS).<br />
<br />
Free to all current DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS ONLINE™ subscribers, the Twilight Forge module is slated for release in July and will include the new drow race, new content for players of all levels, an improved new player experience, and enhanced replayability. Following on the heels of the successful retail launch with over 300,000 units sold worldwide, the Twilight Forge module is the second in a series of planned updates that will provide new content and features for DDO. DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS is under license from the Hasbro Properties Group, the intellectual property development arm of Hasbro.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Twilight Forge module will offer new players an improved single player experience, and existing players will enjoy creating new drow characters and exploring lots of new dungeons,&quot; said Jeffrey Anderson, president and CEO of Turbine, Inc. &quot;We are committed to delivering future DDO modules that include features that continue to expand the game, such as additional character levels and player-versus-player (PvP) battles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Following on the April launch of the Dragon's Vault module, the Twilight Forge module offers new content for players of all levels ranging from new soloable dungeons in the harbor to additional advanced-level quests that culminate in a new raid encounter with the legendary Warforged Titan. The player experience has been vastly improved by including new features that make grouping easier, an improved user interface, and enhancements to the dungeons in the harbor that enable more solo-play and more diverse monster encounters.<br />
<br />
In addition to the ability to create characters based on the drow, also known as the dark elf, players can expect to encounter eight new monsters from the D&amp;D® universe, including the Mindflayer, Ogre Magi, Warforged Titan, Mummy and Lich. Finally, the Twilight Forge module includes a new award system that gives players bonuses for completing dungeons on all difficulty levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the where the hell are the gnomes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also I would like to ban all the drizzt/elrond/legolas wankers.<br />
<br />
Edit: f**kwads and f**ktards beat the filter!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But seriously though... why add another goddamn elven race anyway? Turbine like Blizzard's ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because like it or not drow are popular. I mean you just can't not love drizzt, it's literaly an impossibility. Also there's draconia I believe her name was from Baldur's Gate II.<br />
<br />
Oh and Tea I will hold you personally responsible if I meet HIM ingame all of a sudden, and he starts that horrifying game of 20 questions again. :lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh no, I understand that drow are popular... but they're also a simple pallette swap. Kinda like, oh... I dunno, blood elves? It's not like they're really a distinct race anyhow... just... a different color, maybe with the ability to throw out a sphere of darkness X times per day to annoy the party. Why not... well, mother******* gnomes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am also making a prediction right now for the next race to be added to the game...<br />
<br />
Half-Elves are a SURE bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not....<br />
<br />
Half-Drow? :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sillis</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ironic thing is, in the Ebberon book for PnP it specifically mentions Drow as not being a good choice for PCs.<br />
<br />
Creative control can die in a fire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's an idea, we need some half-orcs, seriously I think they would make a fine addtion, atleast after drow. Then you would have a wide range of &quot;goodly&quot; races to choose from. Human, halflingen, warforgeden, dwarven, elven, drowen, and half-orcen.</div></div><hr />
