<br />
Make up a passle o zombies, send em ahead one or two at a time.  When somthing other than a monster splatters them, you can be pretty sure theres a trap there.  If youre real fancy, have the zombies each carry a caged canary, to detect poison gasses too.  I'd recommend not using skeletons, as they are too light to set off many pressure triggered traps.  If you only have skeletons to animate, put an extra backpack on em and fill it with rocks.</div></div><hr />

'Course, for it to work one must a) deign to adventure with an evil cleric and b) have a ready supply of (not-so) fresh corpses...   Kehvrynne Quickblade, Professional Damsel of Distress<br />

P.S. Animate dead cost exp every time you cast it.</div></div><hr />

Grimtooth had the silliest traps around (they're great party killers though - People usually start sweating whenever I so much as glance at the Grimtooth books). How do the traps and treachery books compare to it?<br />

I will say that alot of my favorite traps are the anti-siege engine traps.  Like the jaw gate.  I'm just fascinated by siege warfare.</div></div><hr />

Take zombies. Cut open zombies. Stuff zombies full of Russet Mold. Sew zombies shut.<br />
<br />
When a PC hit a zombie the russet mold would spray spores across a large area. =)<br />

I suppose thats one way to prevent necromancers from making too many zombies. 1st edition has no such limit, that I recall.   One campaign I was in the GM had a rule that keeping the undead animated made it so the animator couldnt mem new spells for those slots (ie, if youre a 6th level cleric with a 17 wis, you get 3 3rd level spells.  each spell slot was sufficient to keep 6 zombies/skeletons animated, so you could have 18 maximum active at once, and if you did, you couldnt mem ant new 3rd level spells)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it costs like 250xp I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_GoatsAndGippos</div><div class="date">07-12-02, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Other good trap detectors are the new members in the party and body parts of slain party members after they've been stripped of there valuables. Cheaper then a funeral and you actually get somthing out of it instead of the standard party burial of being kicked into a ditch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">07-13-02, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran a half orc once who had a thriving business supplying body parts to alchemists and such.  Mostly the parts came from what we killed, but occasionally he'd scavenge a few bits off slain party members.  I loved having elves in the party... Elf blood (used in longevity potions) was a hot seller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-16-02, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">snicker just got the group together to game again this weekend and one of our guys is playing a drunken kobold sorcerer. he happens to have a book by AEG on dragons and such and it has a section listing which parts of which dragons are useful and what you can use them for. we ended up fighting a hydra and a dragon turtle and MAN did he jump all over those corpses harvesting interesting bits. He's got a high alchemy and can brew potions so I'm a little afraid of accepting any of the beer he has offered me so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Berdusk</div><div class="date">09-04-02, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, is it just new traps? because some of the feats and classes of Traps and Treachery were nifty... if 2 has some as well I might look into it. If not...</div></div><hr />
