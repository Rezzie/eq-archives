<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ballius</div><div class="date">10-06-99, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I swear, nobody makes cigars like them barbarians.&quot;  Ballius Goodchild took another puff from his cigar, and looked back at the mess he made.  A young bear's carcass, dragged through the forest with a prominent trail of blood behind it, laying next to a smoldering fire of freshly cut wood, shooting huge amounts of smoke into the night air.  A rustle of leaves above him caught the rogue's attention.  Ballius looked up, and saw three figures: all half-elves, presumably rangers.  One was female and a child, unarmed, and kneeling behind the elder ranger.  &quot;Probably her first expedition,&quot; Ballius thought.  &quot;Ironic.&quot;   <br />
    <br />
 &quot;By the protectors of Surefall Glade,&quot; the younger ranger prominently declared, &quot;we hereby declare your crimes as punishable by death.  Have you any last words, vile cretin?&quot;   <br />
    <br />
 The human took a last draw from his cigar, and tossed it into the fire.   <br />
    <br />
 The younger looked to the elder for confirmation.  A nod, and the arrows flew towards their target.  The female looked on excitedly, but was surprised when the arrows only hit soft ground.  Her attention was then drawn to her brother, who slumped out of his branch post and landed on the ground with a thud.  An ornate dagger protruded from his back.  Tears began to form in the girl's eyes, when she heard her father beside her grunt in pain.  The human was behind him, dagger planted in his back.  The girl's father looked down at her, head twitching from the poison circulating through his body.  With his last breaths, he told her to run.  Run.   <br />
    <br />
 The mother cursed as she drew her arrow back, the human's head in dead aim.  &quot;Thank Tunare he hasn't spotted me,&quot; she thought.  In the next split second of her life, she realized her mistake.  An arrow flew from the brush, and planted itself between the rogue's feet.  The mother lurched back from her hidden position, throwing dagger firmly set between her eyes.  The father and mother fell from the trees simultaneously.   <br />
    <br />
 &quot;Why?!&quot; the young girl cried.  &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;   <br />
    <br />
 Ballius turned to the girl, and flicked his wrists.  Daggers appeared in his hands.   <br />
    <br />
 &quot;I swear, we'll find you.  And we'll kill you, you vile-- you vile beast!&quot;   <br />
    <br />
 To this, Ballius slowed his advance, and smirked.  The girl realized that no one would know it was him.  She didn't even know his name.  Then, she began to cry.  Ballius drew his dagger back to strike, but hesitated.  &quot;Dammit,&quot; he thought to himself, and brought the hilt of his blade into the side of the girl's skull, knocking her unconscious.  For a moment the murderer stood there, looking down at the girl who was precariously leaning on the branch.  He looked at the familiar curves of the girl's face, and the memories flooded back.   <br />
    <br />
 &quot;Linasa...&quot;   <br />
    <br />
 A tear ran down the rogue's cheek, along a long scar.  What has he become?  What caused all of this?  Of course.  Revenge.  Mammoth.   <br />
    <br />
 Ballius gripped his blade tightly and rigidly placed it against the girl's throat.  Anger was welling inside him.  His scar burned with hatred, hatred for the things that were taken away from him.  The dagger shook at the girl's throat, but gradually stood still.  The anger subsided once again.  It was at this moment, that Ballius knew.  He knew that he would die.  <br />
   <br />
 ooc: phew!  that was fun &quot;Blink once, you're dead.  Blink twice, you're buried.  Understand?  Now unpack yourself.&quot;Edited by Ballius at: 10/6/99 6:49:36 pm<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dreaderus</div><div class="date">10-07-99, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sneering softly to himself, Ballias puffed lightly again on his cigar, looking down at his helpless unconcious victim. Ballias knew what he had done, and although the pity inside him would seep away, the thrill of his next kill would be overwhelming him not many sundowns from now. He thought of retribution, and without a thought, clamped his hand down on top of the child's mouth. The child seemed to be dreaming, as she died, never knowing the life that could have been hers had been snuffed out by another for no reason. <br />
  <br />
 Stepping around the clearing gingerly retrieving his assorted weaponry that lay embedded in the 3 victims, Ballias was to lost in thought, to notice a sillouetted figure on the ridge of the clearing watching him intently. With a gaze of dead calm water, the black cloaked figure calcuated the Murderous Rogue.  <br />
  <br />
 &quot;eh Whats that&quot; Ballias snorted, looking up, his trained ears picking up some sound, but the clearing was empty, and as Ballias  carried his gaze across the area. He chuckled softly to himself, thinking of the good times he would be having at the Inn later that night. &quot;Gezebel, the barmaid&quot;, he thought warmly as a hint of mischief gleamed in his eyes, You don't want to be seeing like likes of me tonight.&quot; <br />
  <br />
 Routing through the older man's pockets, Ballias realized the pickings were quite slim, finding only a paltry amount of silver and a few coppers. Cursing to himself out loud, he made his way away from his victims' corpses towards the stream he had passed on his way to the farmhouse. He knelt down by the stream, and thats when the stranger spoke to him.  <br />
  <br />
 &quot;Was the girl necessary?&quot; <br />
  <br />
 Ballias's eyes shot up, and he had his Rapier in his hand, squaring off at the stranger who stood not more then thirty paces from him, crouching, someone might conclude, almost casually, considering he had just told a murderer he had witnessed his foul deeds. <br />
  <br />
 Ballias quickly analazing the stranger, could not tell where he came from, the man was covered in black, with deep red/back pants, a black hood, and a long travellers cloak covering him. Dark red eyes blazed intently on Ballias making it clear to the vetaran rogue that this figure was not taking him lightly despite his demenure. For some reason he could not explain, Ballias feared the stranger, knowing that something about this person was different, unexplained. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;What business is yours here&quot; Ballias spat defensively, ill-prepared on being snuck up apon, with him being the one in that role for all purposes. Inside Ballias was cursing himself for not being more careful, now he would have to kill again and cover his tracks, Nirdalel, Half-Elf town to the north, was sure to send out search parties if 3 villlagers did not show up for the morning harvest. <br />
  <br />
 Shifting abruptly to his feet in a single fluid motion, the stranger again stared silently at the human rogue. &quot;Maybe this is none of my concern, Maybe I should just be on my way.&quot; Ballias thought evilly, &quot;aye, turn your back on  me laddy, turn your back.&quot; He shifted his best dagger to his offhand, readying for a pounce should the stranger expose his back. &quot;no witnesses&quot; echoed in his mind, &quot;no witnesses&quot;.  <br />
  <br />
 But the stranger backed up, almost knowing what Ballias was thinking, and Ballias eased up his readiness for attack, and he was not sure why. Was he going to let this stranger live after he had seem him murder the girl? Just as he was debating this issue, he noticed the figure had stopped moving, and two wicked looking daggers were in his hands, with swirling black runes lacing the handles and blades. Ballias stared at them almost mesmerized by the gleam of them, the mastery of their design.... <br />
  <br />
 &quot;Then again, maybe it is my business, why a dirty human is killing his half-kind without any apparent reason other then a few coins&quot; the stranger wisped, in a low strained voice filled with disipline. Ballias pegged him now as a full elf, but he was not sure which breed, but he knew the sitation developing was not to his advantage, should the stranger be some form of spell user. Ballias knew he would have to now fight the stranger, and wanted it over quickly. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;You meddled, now you going to die elf cuss!&quot; and he flew at the stranger, his rapier whirling towards its target: the strangers head. cat-quick, the stranger back-flipped 3 times away from the startled human, and a small dagger whizzed at Ballias and caught him flush in the shoulder.  <br />
  <br />
 &quot;Arggh you filthy bastard yous is gonna die for that&quot; Ballias screamed in fury, tearing out the dagger from his shoulder, as his blood ran down his side, chilling him to the bone.  <br />
  <br />
 The two figures squared off again, with a now wary Ballias waiting for his advantage. &quot;No poison or your eyes would be spining&quot; the stranger noted out loud to Ballis, as he readied his daggers in a protective stance, almost a crouch again. The human rogue only nodded, and realized now that this was indeed another rogue of some kind. Many rogues of Norrath who practiced poison, refrained from using it on their own, it was just something many save the most evil, would not do. <br />
  <br />
 The two combatants now met again, the figure wielding his two whirling black dirks, in incredible fashion, shocked Ballias, who found his rapier sent sprawling, with a quick dual-attack, but was able to stay clear of the weapons. Not to be outdone, the rogue swept his leg at the stranger, who now somersaulted over the rogue, and then again went to his defensive crouch. Ballias was able to retrieve his disarmed weapon. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;You fight well&quot; the stranger told Ballias, and then pondered before speaking his next words. &quot;Its a shame you had to kill an innocent, for you will die here&quot;. <br />
  <br />
 Fighting anger mixed with fear, and the fact the pain in his shoulder was now starting to affect him, Ballias retorted &quot;You'll be dying soon stranger&quot; and launched another attack at the stranger, they came together briefly, Ballias's rapier getting entangled with the stranger's two dirks, but one came free, and with a quick flick of motion, the stranger severed Ballias outstretched offhand at the wrist.  <br />
  <br />
 &quot;Arhrhhghhhh&quot; shouded Ballias in pain, tumbling to the ground, clutching the remains of his bleeding hand, the stranger returned to his defensive position. <br />
  <br />
 The stranger spoke now, in a full voice. My name to you is unimportant, just know that people in these lands call me Slinker, and I am an assassin. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;You bastard you cut my hand off&quot; shouted Ballias and he rolled over and swung his rapier at Slinker. With a simple kick the rapier was sent sprawling, but the momentum of the human carried into the stranger, and sent them both tumbling to the ground, the stranger's hood came free, and Ballias now could see who he was dealing with. <br />
  <br />
 &quot;te'rdil, Dark-Elf!&quot; he rasped. &quot;I'll kill ye with my one good hand&quot;. But the human could tell now he was overmatched, and he knew that unless he did something quickly he would soon perish to this superior skilled individual. <br />
  <br />
 Grabbing some dirt off the ground with his one remaining hand, he threw it at the exposed eyes of Slinker, who seeing this coming, got out of the way by dodging to the side, but this left him off his guard for a brief second. Seeing his only advantage laying right before him he quickly got up, and jumped at the dark-elf, who caught him with two boots in the gut, grabbed his arms, and sent him spinning over the top of him. As he landed on his back and the air blew out of his lungs, panic now set into Ballias. As quickly as he could he started to run away from the area of his fight with the dark-elf assassin. As he ran he thought to himself &quot;Dam be it all, why does this evil one care about humans&quot; as his aching body ran, now with no weapons left, he tried to keep moving, and looking back once he saw no one following. <br />
  <br />
 His running speed hindered by his shoulder and wounded hand, the dwarf was soon out of breath and stopped, to catch some air. Looking around he saw nothing. Heard nothing. In a brief frenzied attack, Slinker appeared, from the air, and planted both daggers square into the back of the doomed rogue, some mystical energies ran throughout Ballias, possibly powers of the daggers the dark-elf wielded, perhaps.  <br />
 Ballias's empty lifeless eyes were staring open before his body hit the ground impacting with such force that Slinker was able to rebound and spring off his victim, into a small tree, in the same movement.  <br />
  <br />
 All was quiet, save the spastic, nerve movements of the dead human rogue. His eyes glaring red, disgust, maybe? anger? After that Slinker, seemingly lathargic in nature, pondered his situation for a brief instant, then faded into the darkness without a single explanation for entire encounter. <br />
  <br />
 Dusk was simmering now, settling in for another evening of darkness. It was just the time before dark came, that time seemed like forever. <br />

 (no offense to the rogue auther  hehe i just added to his story :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ballius</div><div class="date">10-07-99, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, wow.  Since you spelled my name wrong (Ballias), I'm assuming this is some other rogue in a similar situation.  Curious, though, that you thought I killed the girl.  Also curious, that you would have Ballias kill her without reason (every action Ballius did had reason, mostly affected by his personal history).  Anyway, the rogue I play is actually named Ballius, and yes, that story was meant to be part of his history.  It wouldn't make much sense if he was dead ;) <br />
  <br />
 ps--did you have to cut off his hand?  sheesh!  and did you call me a dwarf? *scowls* &quot;Blink once, you're dead.  Blink twice, you're buried.  Understand?  Now unpack yourself.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dreaderus</div><div class="date">10-07-99, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well there are res's in the game :) actually i was bored and just continued the story hehe, sory about spelling your name wrong, dont take the story the wrong way its just something I added. I did not assume you killed the girl, just in my continuation the rogue was scared hed be found out and killed the girl anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Legna Nellaf</div><div class="date">10-07-99, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I rather enjoyed it. especially the second part. I mean think of how the story turned out. Now think of the average happenings in the game? <br />
  <br />
 Human kills human. <br />
 human comes back, tells friend (de) <br />
 This wonderfully GOOD natured DE comes and kills the EVIL human. lol <br />
  <br />
 I have been all over, and no where in all the dark races is there as much senseless pks as I have found in the presence of the lighter races. Kind of funny if You think about it. Either way, both were good. <br />
  <br />
 -L &quot;Legna, if you are a fighter, how do you backstab?&quot;&quot;Turn around and I'll show you my secret&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dreaderus</div><div class="date">10-08-99, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha thanx!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ballius</div><div class="date">10-09-99, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awww, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to come off as so mean.  I purposely left the ending open for other to interpret, and thought it was neat that you continued it with me killing the girl.  It's just that... well shucks, Balls isn't supposed to be evil, persay, just kinda screwed up.  I guess I'll have to clarify with more stories :) <br />
  <br />
 *does the rogue dance of apology* &quot;Blink once, you're dead.  Blink twice, you're buried.  Understand?  Now unpack yourself.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Daklin</div><div class="date">02-17-01, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, good story.</div></div><hr />
