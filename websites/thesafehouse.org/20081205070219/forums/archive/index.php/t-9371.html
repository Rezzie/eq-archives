It's been locking up and crashing on me since beta, but since release it went from once every hour or so to once every five minutes. Well, I've finally FINALLY found a solution that appears to work for me.<br />
<br />
I set up my RAM in single-channel mode. :hmph Hours and hours of upgrading drivers, uninstalling drivers, reinstalling drivers, tweaking graphics settings, tweaking hardware settings... <br />
<br />
Three or four hours of play time since I switched my RAM sticks around and I haven't crashed once. It may not sound like much if you haven't been plagued by this problem, but to me the feeling is akin to finding a thousand dollars under your couch cushions.<br />
<br />
I don't know why, I don't know how, but it works. If you're having stability problems and you use a dual-channel RAM setup, try single-channel and see what's what.</div></div><hr />
