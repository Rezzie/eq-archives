1. will i gimp myself if i do this at 50:<br />
 Sword 40<br />
 Evenom 40<br />
 LA 39<br />
 Stealth 40<br />
<br />
2.  Im pretty sure the anwser to 1 is yes... so can you explain that to me?  Im a newbie to this class...<br />
<br />
3.  Posions... if i did the above stats i was thinking about having 2 onehand swords on me with different posions, and another posion on my left axe.  I would get 3 of the 4 posions off (hopefully).  This seems to me that it would be a VARY good thing :P  <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading this and helping if you did.  Hope i didnt annoy you guys by asking something that gets asked like everyday too.  <br />

You can get those to 50 with items and realm points, and going over 50 is 100% wasteful.<br />
<br />
Get your weapon skill up higher, and get LA to 39 or the next style if you can.<br />
<br />
Oh and you have no critical strike, which is kinda why people play assassins =).  Mind as well go be a berzerker if not going with crit.  Crit does insane damage and has a great anytime chain.<br />
<br />
Theoretically if you went crit and sword you would have great damage and styles.  But you seem to like left axe, but that just makes ofr less fun of the &quot;assassin&quot;<br />
