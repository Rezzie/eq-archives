It's a long series of quests, so telling you explicitly where to start is not much of a spoiler...<br />
<br />
Go to Lakeview (Thestra) and head out to the island in the middle of the lake. Kill the various Zar bad guys there until one of them drops a Unicorn Horn (shouldn't take long). Then, right click it to use it and start the quest line....<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

P.S. Although you can start/do the quests at much lower levels, you need to be level 30 to actually use the Unicorn Mount. And it will cost you 10g along the way.... just FYI.</div></div><hr />
