<br />
Hi, folks.  While camping the Brewer in Blackburrow, I wrote a song - I'd like to share it with you.  If anyone wants to add a verse or two, feel free!<br />
<br />
:::Bayler gestures at the bard, who begins to play a harmonica.:::<br />

I’ve got the Blackburrow Brewer Blues.<br />
I’ve got those Blackburrow Brewer Blues.  (oh my!)<br />
I’m waiting on the cask; my ration stack won’t last.<br />
‘Cause it’s Lonn’s path to redemption that I choose.<br />
I’ve got to pay the toll so I’m waiting for the gnoll.<br />
I’ve got the Blackburrow Brewer Blues.<br />
<br />
One hundred and one gnolls have gone by.<br />
Every now-and-again a young’n will give ‘em a try.<br />
I’ll save the chap from dying if it doesn’t disrupt my timing.<br />
If I miss my spawn, some wiz will suck it dry.<br />
I’m the hero of this underworld, in eighteen minute intervals.<br />
One hundred and one gnolls have gone by.<br />
<br />
The price of a cask is really getting me down.<br />
For that kind of money I’d need a Froglock Crown.<br />
I spent all my money on pottery, so I’m playing the Gnollville Lottery -<br />
that’s why when you see me I wear this tired frown.<br />
My competition’s a level 5 woodelf male who’s got a full suit of Ravenscale.<br />
The price of  a cask is really getting me down.<br />
<br />
I’ve got the Blackburrow Brewer Blues.<br />
I’ve got the Blackburrow Brewer Blues.<br />
A guy in Highpass wants his drinks; my spirits are in the sink.<br />
Can anyone make Ol' TJ's fierce brew?<br />
My next stop is Mayong’s bungalow where I’ll be doing the Mistmoore Mambo.<br />
(But for now) It’s the Blackburrow Brewer Blues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Bayler says, &quot;Sure thing!&quot;<br />

Bayler says, &quot;Has anyone got a sealed vial I can borrow, so I can make the antidote for this guy?&quot; Bayler<br />

     <br />
Did the same thing for 15 hours straight, not one cask</div></div><hr />

<br />
 It's a long road to repentance for my sins;<br />
so I'm chasing 'lites to kill 'em and take their skins.<br />
The morality makes me wince, but it's for the Burning Prince.<br />
Has anyone given this recipe to Dvinn?<br />
Who'd have thought I'd be redeemed mashing gnoll pup scalps in mead?<br />
It's a long road to repentance for my sins.</div></div><hr />

I had to camp this spawn for 20 hours straight before I finally got my cask. I fell asleep once and missed the spawn and what should I learn when I get back? Hehe, it was the master brewer himself. I couldn't stop laughing. was way too tired to be mad. Well anyways I finally got the cask. Now I gotta get the skins. *sigh*</div></div><hr />

<br />
the first thing I thought when I read it was I should maybe take some supplies down to you an keep you company for a while.<br />
But I'm on a different server - sorry.<br />
<br />
Are you a ring member? Hmmm this gives me a thought!</div></div><hr />
