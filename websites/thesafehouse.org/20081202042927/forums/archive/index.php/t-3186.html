(Here's a hint, when you are stopping for food or to set up camp and the rogue is looking for poisons constantly be cautious.  Also check your armor after bathing in the river before putting it back on, there could be 10 different contact poisons in it).  Actually I think I did hit him once with my belt buckle knife, always tried to keep that puppy covered in the ever so deadly &quot;Type N&quot; (make your save you take 25 damage, fail and you die.)<br />
<br />
Probably make another poison wielding rogue since I never really finished the game really.  (stupid lvl 9 had a spell that activates when he dies that casts some sort of prismatic beam at whoever casts with the effect of make saving through or be banished from that plane of existance, guess who missed the save by 1?)</div></div><hr />

Now if only I can get my hands on another of those insanely nice Katanas Rex had.  Can't remember the name of it right now, but in BGII I cleaned out the whole game.. it was from the Slave Lord's compound from one of their thieves.  (that was a fun lil fight, eh?     ) Celestial Katana or something like that, can't remember the exact name.<br />

<br />
-  Fighter. 3rd edition D&amp;amp;D fighters are a serious bag of ownage.<br />
<br />
-  Ranger. 3rd edition rangers are okay if somewhat lackluster, but NWN is said to address this by making them a bit more interesting. Rangers were my favorite class in 2nd edition, so I might check them out again.<br />
<br />
-  Wizard. Dwarf wizard with a toad familiar (+2 Con for being a dorf, +2 Con for toad familiar = wizard with 20 Con). How can I pass up a wizard that gets 1d4+5 hit points per level? Also, in 3rd edition you can cast spells and remain invisible as long as said spells are not attack spells. Summon monster 1-IX are not attack spells, but they do summon critters to fight for you. Invisible, 20 Con, summoning monsters to fight....yeah, that's a good possibility.<br />
<br />
-  Cleric. 3rd edition clerics are very powerful. Platemail, 2nd-best attack bonus, best heal spells in D&amp;amp;D, lots of other cool buffs and wards and offensive spells (flame strike, searing light, blade barrier)...yeah, cleric is a distinct possibility.<br />
<br />
-  Charisma Rogue. 12 skills and 8 skill points per level = master of whatever you want to be master of. A Cha rogue who can bluff, intimidate, etc would be awesome. Not to mention Sneak Attack owns.<br />
<br />
-  Elven Monk. Nothing uber, just sounds neat. <br />
<br />
Tough call. Will have to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  <br />
<br />
The parents of them were a female elf and human male so all of their offspring should have been half-elves.  This was some kind of special birth.  I forget how our DM justified it, I think he just liked the idea (which I presented to him) enough to allow it to be incorporated into our campaign.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hummerlein</div><div class="date">06-25-02, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm thinking of making a part ranger, part cleric, part rogue, or something along those lines.<br />
<br />
i was thinking about doing a monk, but bleh...no armor = teh suck, even with ultra godly resists and stuff.<br />
<br />
high dex ranger/rogue sounds just too cool, with the cleric added in for bonus healage.<br />
<br />
i was thinking human, but i don't have the game yet so i'm not sure how that will work.  if humans are sucky, might go halfling for the dex bonus, but then again the -con will suck, and i only lose the multiclass penalty for the rogue part.<br />
<br />
decisions, decisions...<br />
<br />
 edit:<br />
on second thought, a combo monk/wizard might be cool, too. Edited by: Hummerlein at: 6/26/02 2:03:23 am</div></div><hr />

I still need to buy the damnable game.   Hows the story shaping up for those that have gotten a ways?  Is it up to bg1/2 quality? <br />

I'm sticking with the rogue from here on out I think.  Might do a level or 2 of barb again to get more HPs.  Me and the Half-Orc dude are killing machines, I'm loving the duel Katanas.  Very cool game, I'm hooked  <br />

<br />
overall its pretty good,but its really made to be played with friends,not really a solo game.<br />
<br />
the real issue comes into play when your dealing with the tech side of the game. things like pathing,area layouts,and then the expected bugs in the game.<br />
<br />
if your a dedicated world builder,the game will really shine down the road,but its going to be buggy for awile.<br />
<br />
as a solo game,morrowind is better by far imo. NWN will really outpreform it once mods start showing up,its the perfect game to sit down at a lan party,or 2-3 nights a week with a group of friends,or your guild from an online game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kind of a Battle Cleric of sorts:<br />
<br />
Starting Stats:<br />
<br />
14 STR<br />
8 DEX<br />
14 CON<br />
10 INT<br />
16 WIS<br />
14 CHA<br />
<br />
Added 2 points to WIS from leveling, will add 1 more for 9th level spells.<br />
<br />
Picked the Power Attack/Improved Power Attack feats, along with the War &amp;amp; Healing domains for the uber battle buffs and also picked Extra Turning Undead.  To AE turn undead = room full of undead bodies quickly, the higher level undead simply run away (into walls usually) to be slaughtered at my convenience.<br />
<br />
Currently in Chapter 2, in the Creator levels, below the Troll caves...  seem to finally have found a semi-difficult area to fight... the creator levels are rocking me silly!<br />

He and his new half orc barbarian companion are currently kicking arse and taking names throughout the region.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm planning on creating my two LARP characters, a human barbarian sword-and-board fighter, and a polearm-wielding dark elf rogue (no one ever expects to be waylaid by a guy with a polearm). <br />
<br />
I'm hopefully going to start writing a few modules soon... gotta get time to play with the world builder first.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Syllestrae FV</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my character (sorry it's long, just thought I'd lay out all the details in case people wanted to know how choices worked out)<br />
<br />
Class: Pure Cleric (level 8 ) <br />
Race: Human<br />
Starting Stats...<br />
   Str: 14 (16-19 w/ buffs)<br />
   Con: 14 (16-19 w/ buffs)<br />
   Dex: 12<br />
   Int: 10<br />
   Wis: 14 (added 2 points at level ups, so it's 16 now)<br />
   Cha: 14 (16-19 w/ buffs)<br />
<br />
Domains: Healing, Sun<br />
Feats: Martial Weapons, Extra Turning, Extend Spell, Toughness<br />
<br />
Spell setups:<br />
level 0: All Light, but usually get cast as cure minor.<br />
Level 1: Bless &amp;amp; Protection from evil, but usually get cast as cure light.<br />
level 2: If I'm in a group, bull's strength &amp;amp; endurance.  When soloing, all cure serious (searing light if fighting tough undead).<br />
level 3: Extended Bull's strength, Endurance, Eagle's Grace.  Other two slots for healing or more buffs depending.<br />
level 4: All summon creature IV (I play on a server w/ summon durations much closer to PHB values)<br />
<br />
Skills: Mainly focused on Concentration &amp;amp; Lore.  A little bit in Healing, and 1 point in open locks &amp;amp; remove traps.<br />
<br />
With the extended duration buffs, my cleric ends up with more HP than some fighters I group with, and is able to put out similar damage.  She doesn't have the feats to go crazy w/ cleave or anything, but it allows her to hold her ground in a fight.  Concentration is high enough that she can still get off her healing spells while in the thick of combat.<br />
<br />
She freaking obliterates undead.   The stuff she can't turn (ie: skeletal warriors) get lasered with searing light spells (1d8/level, no save) while her pet keeps them occupied.  With the high charisma, and sun domain, she can destroy screens full of lesser undead, which aside from being really funny, is also great XP.  She gets 12-13 turns per day depending on how high she rolls on the charisma buff, which is way plenty (I've never run out).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Haranavei</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having fun playing an elven druid so far, with several other characters already rolled up-ranger, fighter and of course, rogue.<br />
<br />
The druid and ranger use the same last name (Tir'eine, game generated but I really like it) and I'm in the process of building a forest stronghold with the toolset. <br />
<br />
I haven't played pnp in eons, but it's nice to be able to start recreating the moon elven family that my old character had all come from-maybe some will end up as npcs.</div></div><hr />
