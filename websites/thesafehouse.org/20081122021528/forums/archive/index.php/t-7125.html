<br />
Have VI suddenly Made this epic from nearly impossible to get- to nearly handing them out to the clerics?<br />
<br />

It could be that he delevelled after attaining his epic, poss due to a bug, but if he was epic he could have just ressed himself several times...<br />
<br />
Not sure on that one. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kaysha Soulsinger</div><div class="date">10-02-02, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's easy. The Robe of the Plasmatic Priest in the Sol Temple can be transferred between characters. So this player just killed both Goblins and the Plasmatic Priest with his Warrior. Then he handed the Robe to his Cleric. After that, the Cleric handed the Robe to the Quest NPC, recieving the first Orb. Warrior handed the ring of one of the Goblins to another Quest NPC that spawned on the turn in by his Cleric and from then on completes the next two Orbs.<br />
<br />
Warrior hands the two Orbs he has to Jhassad who spawns near the end of the quest and then had his Cleric give the final Orb, making the Cleric recieve the last quest piece needed, turning it in to the Avatar of Water which spawned at that moment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ravvenstar</div><div class="date">10-02-02, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, it is a bug. Right now the NPCs will talk and accept items from a lvl 1 cleric, let alone a lvl 60.  It has been a bug like this for quite a while now.   <br />

This isn't anything new.  There isn't gonna be any nerf, it's been like this for nearly two years now.<br />
<br />
Rogue epic, for one, can't be.<br />
<br />
Epics before level 50 do not give any effects, and the ones that are clickable can't be clicked until 50.<br />

Ones I've seen on pre 50 chars:<br />

<br />
I'm in the Navy and love playing Everquest when I go home on vacations.  Usually my brother lets me play all I want while I'm there but this time he was just about to finish up his epic.  When I got home Naggy had just been taken out so he was starting his Ragefire camp.  He asked me to stay up and watch out for Fire Giants who were supposed to spawn at about 4 or 5 in the morning.  Well I was having fun for a little while swimming around in lava and healing myself, but that gets boring really fast so I decided to take a little nap, and wake up around 3 so I could watch for the Fire Giants.  Thats not how it worked out though, I slept through the Fire Giants spawn and the first 30-40 deaths, as my brother had bound himself in a bad place(chamber I guess).  Luckily, and I really mean LUCKY,  my mom was getting ready for work, saw I was asleep and logged me off so that she could check her E-Mail.<br />
<br />
<br />
My brothers Cleric went from 57 to level 54.  According to the GM when my bother petioned, it was very possible that he could of ended up a level 5 cleric, If he had not been logged off by Mom.  So yea if you do something dumb it is possible to be a level 41, or 5, who has their epic.<br />

Was three yellows into 60, went to sleep for a short while, came back, found myself naked in Lavastorm and three blues left till 60 again.  Oh well, I got 60 back and managed to get my epic and help a friend get hers all at the same time.   Mianya Menkia<br />
