However, I chose to go the route of my Undead Hunter's bloodlines, and not my Rogue.  So I won't get to see this for myself.  But I like that it's there.</div></div><hr />

I don't get it...  I did the quest and finished it, but I don't get the easter egg... I don't see what it is I guess.  Email me at shane256@gmail.com if you don't want to spoil it for others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shotoif</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I noticed about this quest is you always finish it on the third attempt. If the guards here a noise freeze for 15-30 secs and it will cut down on agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maht Stohlit</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can fail it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velvetrose</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 times? I was able to do it my first time out.  Maybe I was lucky :)  I crept along the walls and as soon as I saw that someone &quot;heard something&quot; I froze for a few seconds then continued on.  Made it past all the guards got the report and got out the same way.  It was very cool sneaking past them and &quot;hearing&quot; them say ...&quot;did you hear that?  Is someone there??..No there is no one there you must be hearing things&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe the key is to freeze once a guard speaks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hodurbear</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can definitely fail it.  My first four attempts, I was getting attacked before I even zoned in, so I had to immediately zone back out.  Even zoning in while in sneak mode didn't seem to help.  On my fifth try, I managed to zone in without being detected, tried to go around the back, and was attacked by the lonely guard.  On my sixth try, I tried to go over the top of the boxes and was attacked by her again.  On my seventh try, I just sneaked right in front of the guards, and never had a problem.  <br />
<br />
I should note that I went linkdead after the first four tries, so I was probably bugged.  If you are getting attacked before you move from the zone in, you should probably log out and back in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koryn</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did it on the first try also.  I only had a guard say, 'Did you hear that', etc, twice.  When I heard it, I stopped to look around and see if any guards were after me.  When I didn't see any, I continued on.  Felt alot like Splinter Cell or Metal Gear.  I never had any problems, and I even snuck into the break room and listened to the guards complain about having to save someone from a gnoll at work that day.  Funny stuff!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Long time lurker here all the way back to the old EQ days.<br />
<br />
I have one small question with this quest, can anyone tell me about where in the guard room the orders that I have to steal are? I have been all over that room I have seen the  guards in the back relaxing, the lonely guard even up the stairs, but these darn orders I just can seam to find. Also is it something I pick up or will my journal just update.<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
You have to go into the main offices of the Port Authority and steal 2 log books.  <br />
<br />
Same principals as in Qeynos...sneak past the guards and search thru all the bookcases and desks in the main office. there is a guard who wanders about so you have to hide behind a desk and freeze when he comes into the same room as you.  I was able to get in and out w/o a problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joonling</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was such a fun quest! I was able to do it in one try with my roommate watching over my shoulder.  He wanted to roll a rogue after that cause he thought it was so cool.  Unfortunately, we've already taken up the 4 character slots  :hmph</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Montag McCleaud</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Durnit.  I did this quest on my first try.  But I think it was only easy because I had already crafted my App III Sneak.  Now I wish I would have done this quest before creating the App III because it sounds a lot more fun with a chance to get caught.<br />
<br />
Heck I was jumping on tables and practically bowling guards over trying to push by them and they didnt notice a thing.  It did'nt feel very rogue-like.   :hmph<br />
<br />
EDIT*<br />
<br />
By the way,  I notice in the picture that Picke is wielding two daggers.<br />
I know this is probly a stupid newbie question, but how did you do that?<br />
I have recieved plenty of weapons that say primary/secondary when I inspect them, but when I try to equip my secondary slot it says I cant do it.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what im doing wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velvetrose</div><div class="date">11-24-04, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In order to Dual Weild...both weapons HAVE to say Dual.  It isnt like in EQ where one says primary/secondary and you can use them in either slot.  So inspect your weapons and look at the :D  &quot;Weild Type&quot;</div></div><hr />
