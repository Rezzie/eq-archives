<br />
I have been looking into SWG but I dont know if its worth the 50 bucks to buy it and the 14 to play it or if I should go after FFXI. <br />
<br />
What do you rogues think?</div></div><hr />

Go with FFXI or watch someone play it if you are cautious about buying. Edited by: Absolute Master at: 11/26/03 6:56 am</div></div><hr />

I can't tell if I have outgrown MMORPGs or if the ones that are out just kinda suck.</div></div><hr />

Its just not worth it at this point.  Your well worth waiting a few months, if you really itching try horizons december 8th. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Doctor Tale</div><div class="date">01-07-04, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SWG at present has about 4-6 months worth of enjoyment if you get over the initial learning curve, then you realise it's a vacuum and quit.<br />
<br />
That said, the post-release dev team (quite different from the original dev team) has just finished adding the features that were missing at release.<br />
<br />
Now they have a chance to add content and make the Galactic Civil War meaningful. I was in beta and played five months after release, but I believe it will take until mid-2004 for them to achieve anything more with this game. If they do it well I might go back, but I'm not paying for an account in the meantime.<br />
<br />
I got to know an excellent SWG PvP guild led by a former officer of a top-5 EQ guild. Being smart people they have set up a very smart player city with defenses that actually work, outsmarting the bugs. Like me they are tired of the game in its current state, but they have something pretty amazing going and if the devs deliver on the GCW (e.g. add AO-style land control with meaningful benefits for victory, beef up the Empire and give incentives for participation) I'd love to see what happens.<br />
<br />
Right now, SWG is a great preview of the EQ2 engine (look at the screenshots, it's SWG with orcs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">01-08-04, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SWG is going to live or die on the space expansion. If they can deliver a decent combat flight sim,then you will see it take off.<br />
<br />
The ground based game,is ok,but lacks any content,and strategy. Havnt played since early november,but pvp/pve was pretty stale then. Typical class balance issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
I cant really recommend the game,but i dont think its much worse then FFXI or horizons. They each have there pitfalls. Short term any are enjoyable,but not one of them has any long term prospects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Peebs</div><div class="date">01-09-04, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got it and was having fun casually playing it until I had to go away on work for a month.  I just couldn't get into it after that and ended up cancelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Melodie Songbird</div><div class="date">01-28-04, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SWG is probably the worst game I have ever played.  It is just so boring, it is missing a factor that I like to call &quot;fun.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Grendahl</div><div class="date">01-28-04, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">NO. From a long time EQ rogue (since beta) who switched over to SWG, it was just plain old released waaaay too early. As a result, the nerfbat hasn't stopped swinging since. <br />
<br />
Content is weak, quests are either way too mundane or extremely difficult (read undoable with current player abilities), and elite professions are far too quick to master. <br />
<br />
In short, you'll get bored quickly. Save your $50 on the game and the $15/month and spend it on upgrades for your computer for the next big thing to come out.</div></div><hr />
