<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GoatR</div><div class="date">05-03-07, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont know if many of you have tried the monster play feature of this game, but I seem to be a little hooked on it at the moment.  After leveling up my Human Burglar to 10 I tried out the monster play as I have always kind of gravitated to the &quot;evil&quot; side of MMOs.  At the creation screen you can choose from a number of different monsters to play and (being the rogue type that I am) I chose the Warg.<br />
<br />
I have found that if you are careful you can sneak just about anywhere in the Ettenmores with the exception of the Hero starting city, and while the monsters are somewhat basic at least to begin with the Warg is very interesting in that it is based on combination moves that can do different debuffs, dots, and stuns.<br />
<br />
The hardcore power levelers are getting close to 50, at least on my server anyway, so if you are getting bored with being a &quot;good&quot; burglar I suggest you head to your local Fell-Scrying pool and try out the darker side of The War.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">05-04-07, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds very intriguing! I'll have to check this out.<br />
<br />
I don't know of any 40s yet on my server (Landroval) but I know folks are getting close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantom Rogue</div><div class="date">05-15-07, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I just picked this game up  yesterday and started on Landroval too (heard it was an unofficial RP server).<br />
<br />
I was going to try the Monster Play, but doesnt seem rewarding enough.  Id ratehr get my Minstrel up a little higher than 8 :)<br />

If anyone wants to chit chat/group, the name is Stralin.<br />

BTW, Fricka, Any word on them new old T-Shirts?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekoken</div><div class="date">05-21-07, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a low level burglar and a low level champion.  But as far as I'm concerned Wargs ARE the rogue class in the game.  You've got stealth and can deal some damage.  Stalking and killing asslings is some of the most fun I think I've ever had in an MMORPG.</div></div><hr />
