The title for the new film series is &quot;Evangelion Shin Gekijou Ban&quot;, it will consist of 4 parts with the first part arriving in Japanese theaters in early summer, 2007. Staff include General Supervisor: Hideaki Anno, Director: Tsurumaki Kazuya , Character Design: Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Mecha Design: Ikuto Yamashita, Animation Production: Khara (Color) Studio. The scenario of the 1st part will be written by Hideaki Anno with storyboard by Shinji Higuchi. Key points of a supposed interview which may or may not appear in the forthcoming edition of Newtype attributed to Toshimichi Ohtsuki of King Records have also been circulating.<br />
<br />
According to that information:<br />
-The content is quite different though the time base of the story is the same as the original TV series.<br />
- It will be a remake, however, it is not a re-creation but a &quot;new work&quot;.<br />
- The approach will be different than what Tomino-san did with the Gundam Z New Translation films, there will apparantly be a large amount of new material.<br />
- Even if the TV series has not be seen, the viewer will be able to enjoy it. Though the content becomes easy, it is not redundant to those already familiar with the series.<br />
- The technique that purposely scatters difficult words and phrases will not be used any longer.<br />
- As an antithesis to current animation industry segments. It is an attitude on the production side to pull the act in the age that started from Eva.<br />
