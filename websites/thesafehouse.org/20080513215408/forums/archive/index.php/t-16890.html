<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takaros</div><div class="date">01-20-05, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any tips on killing paladins (specific to rogue or in general)? On my warrior I generally don't even bother, underpowered class against overpowered class is doomed to failure. But today as a level 30 rogue I got the opening shot (cheap shot) on a level 25 paladin who was killing quest NPC's and he still won. <br />
<br />
I'll admit that I am not a PVP veteran of any game, however this hardly seems fair, considering the only thing he did was melee, do one 5 second stun, use shield and full heal the first time he got low, after that I got him to a sliver and had him him stunned with kidney shot, but he came out of it at the last second and popped Lay Hands for a complete heal and I just ran out of HP. It's worth noting that I was still full HP after his shielding, since I used a bandaid while he was immune.<br />
<br />
Now, I know theres at least a few things I could have done, for one thing I had no poison applied, and I was so shocked that I was losing near the end that I forgot to use a healing potion, but come on.. 5 level advantage and had the surprise attack, and I still lost.  Maybe if I had opened with a good ambush, but I'm not spec'd for it, I'm a sword/mace primary user.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the only way to win against a paladin is try to deny the opportunity for them to use their instant-cast , but it's sooo hard that you just have to hope they mess up, or something. Maybe its better at higher levels, when rogue damage output pulls farther ahead, or something =/</div></div><hr />

Make em think they are winning and they'll be less likely to burn thier immunity and LoH.  Then when they get around half health whig out and kill em before they can.  <br />
<br />
I also like to stack DoT's on em.  If they don't see big numbers going up they're less likely to use oh  moves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seffan Strisciare</div><div class="date">01-21-05, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One good tip is when they are immune, they cant hurt you. So you can either vanish/sneak to re-ambush/cheap shot or you can bandage up while they are immune. This gives you another &quot;life&quot; and always keep healing potions on you. A good thing to do is go toe to toe and explose armor or slice n dice, then your next 5 CP's do a cold blood Eviscerate, that will take them down about 1/4-1/3 of their life if you hit it right you can finish them off with it.<br />
<br />
Also not all palidans are created equal. I was half health at lvl 40 and a lvl 43 pally (full health full mana) comes up to me and starts attacking me. I say what the hell pop off a Sup Healing Potion and start fighting, needless to say I won. On the same page me and my friend (me 44 him 48 both rogues) attacked a 45 pally and he almost took us both down before we got him.<br />
<br />
People say they hate the sneaky rogues that ambush/cheap shot you etc etc, to them I say our class was built around it, and our pvp relies on it. Be a bastard rogue, make him burn his abilities, vanish, heal up, and go get him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">01-26-05, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem fighting pallies is a few things.<br />
<br />
1. Their immune clears all effects, so you lose Dots, poison effects,  warrior loses rend and deep wounds, ect<br />
<br />
2.  They can fire off the immune while stunned.  So unless your lucky they can use it to avoid a finish blow for a while.<br />
<br />
3.  While they have range deficieincies, most hardcore pvp server pallies are using engineering to compensate (being turned into a gimpy leper gnome will ruin your escape).<br />
<br />
4. One of the shields does allow attacking, but at a 50 percent slower rate IIRC.<br />
<br />
5. Hvy Rune bandaids can be used while immune for a good heal and no mana expenditure<br />
<br />
A couple things I use to my advantage<br />
<br />
1. Blind poison.  works great for giving me a second (or with prep 3rd) chance to bandage in a longish fight.  <br />
<br />
2.  A good hard hitting ranged weapon.  When he immunes, get some distance and hit him with a 200-300 pt shot to whittle him some.<br />
<br />
3.  Gouge, cheapshot and kidney shot.  Anything that pauses him and lets you get a good solid shot in (I use daggers), thus wearing down his number of immunes,LOH, heals ect.<br />
<br />
4.  I will always drag the fight into  1 or more mobs and then vanish to drop them onto him.  More damage and chance of them finishing him off if he kills me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Retrib Aura = Gouge/Backstab joust time. I keep a dagger just for it!<br />
<br />
if he takes out his big axe and fires Seal of Command, to hit for that overpowered holy damage, then good jousting with a plate class..<br />
<br />
(AND you can burn in Consecrated grounds at the same time non-stop).<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Is there a way to snare a paladin and range-kite him the likes of a hunter?<br />
<br />
[nothing frustrates a paladin more, so that would make for psychological victory too]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">04-11-05, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If he throws Consecration, I just run out of it, if he doesn't follow, he gets plinked with arrows.  While it's true I'll run out of arrows before he could run out of mana and hp, I doubt he's patient enough to wait that long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mideon</div><div class="date">04-22-05, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found Holy Protection Potions to be quite kickass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erevis</div><div class="date">05-10-07, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">usually after a pally pops an immunity for me, i tend to back off far enough to re-stealth (ive only encountered pallys in the pvp bgs) with vanish and then hit them w/another ambush (im subt. and dagger spec) which is another 700-800 hit, usually, and if he LoHs, i use preperation, vanish, and ambush him again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">08-28-07, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the arena, I usually just jump on him hard till he brings up his bubble.  Then I go attack someone else for 15 seconds, then I spin right around and jump on him again.<br />
<br />
If he's a healing paladin(and 90% of them are in the arena), he goes down pretty fast once bubble is gone.  You just have to hope the rest of your team maintained verticality while he was throwing heals for 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
That's why you want to jump on someone else though.  If you stick on him while he's immune, its just like he has you CCed.  If you go dps someone else, hopefully he'll be too busy healing the guy your doubleteaming to do anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-28-07, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I &lt;3 wounding poison for healing pallies. It can be a real bummer for them when FoL can't keep up anymore with the damage you are doing, and they can't even get off their slower heals. If you force them to blow Lay on Hands early after they've bubbled, you've just won the fight.</div></div><hr />
