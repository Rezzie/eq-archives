<br />
<br />
Any one know<br />
<br />
1. What lvl range this area is?<br />
<br />
2. What the reward for what ever this is.....um is:confused:<br />
<br />
Lvl range is 40+<br />
<br />
Note drops off of Reshnok/Sithar mobs as mentioned in notes, got mine off a 42 Reshnok Fireflinger (2dot).<br />
<br />
Starts quest to find someone to &quot;decipher&quot;, turn in to Dharrek Somethingorother at the outpost there &quot;Winterclaw's Resolution&quot;.<br />
<br />
Starts quest, &quot;Do or Do Not, There is No Try&quot;<br />
Kill 30 Reshnok, 30 Sithar and collect 20 Gerentine (sp?) Seeds.<br />
<br />
Seeds are off groundspawn mushrooms in the area. You want to kill the mobs south of the outpost (mobs in Velerium Mines to the north do not update).<br />
<br />
Reshnok isn't so bad 'cause there are plenty of 2 dots. Sithar are 3 dots only so I had to kite them as a bard (which presents the problem to rogues).<br />
<br />
After that you get another quest (must be 40 to attain... I was 39 at the time so I said screw it and went away).<br />
<br />
The next couple quests require a group no matter who you are basically and after all is said and done the result is a +22str +crit rate/+melee dmg mask with a clicky &quot;Blood of the Feral Warrior&quot; or somethin.<br />
<br />
Too bad the last step is bugged (Requires a 44 Leatherworker to complete and the recipe doesn't work atm because a required ingredient &quot;Grenitine(sp?) Powder&quot; isn't currently in game.<br />
<br />
I've since gotten 40 but due to the bugged last step and having to drag a group there I haven't done it. That and I'm working on my Vee's mask off Ceros Isle (Because for a bard there still isn't a better mask, this one doesn't come close... maybe if the clicky is friggin awesome or somethin.)<br />
<br />
That's the basic summary. More indepth infos here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceradaxas</div><div class="date">06-09-07, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Needed for the Final combine is the broken mask and blood you get from the lord etc, one velerium ore, and the grenitine powder. The crafter has to come to lost canyon to buy the powder.  <br />
<br />
It is a regular, FAILABLE, crafting combine.   The lvl 44 leatherworker guildmate of mine who made it for me almost failed (but he took it to A quality)<br />
<br />
<br />
at A quality it was something like 22 str , 36 crit rate and 69 damage rating<br />
<br />
When I completed the quest this mask got removed from my inventory and replaced with the generic reward one which was 22 str 32 crit 64ish damage rating, so if you get someone to make the mask and it ends up being better than the one listed as quest reward, i say just delete the last quest and enjoy your better mask.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you can also just tell the crafter to shoot for d grade or whatever for super easy mode and hand in the mask for the generic, decent stat one.<br />
<br />
The clicky effect is illusion Vulmane, 1 hour duration<br />
<br />
You gain the racial ability animal reflexes for 10% move rate bonus<br />
<br />
You also gain an ability that shows up in your adventure tab for abilities called Conduct, which is a 45 second refresh instant cast heal (800 points at my measly 81 vitality,  with Vit buffs it goes much higher) that can be applied to yourself or your target.<br />
<br />
Casting the heal breaks stealth/stalking.<br />
<br />
EDIT:WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  QUEST COMPLETION AS OF 9/18/07 IS BORKED! The crafter that completes the mask for you will be stuck with a soulbound mask because SoE is incapable of Thinking anything through.</div></div><hr />

I got the note after maybe 3 reshnok kills while doing other quests. After reading the above, I can't wait to get this knocked out. Hopefully I'll get to head into the mines tonight to knock out the next couple steps.<br />
<br />
Any idea what the end result mask is called and what its level and rarity are?<br />
<br />
I love illusion masks. And I especially love instant heals with a 45 second refresh.<br />
<br />
Edit: Found it on Curse. Level 48 Heroic mask.<br />

The drop rate on the ore seems very low and you will DRASTICALLY reduce the time spent there if you mine it from the special nodes.</div></div><hr />

Or you could just buy it from the NPC at the camp for 1cp each.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-The scout is hidden in the Reshnok part behind a panel made of wood logs, close to the Living Reshnok Statue monster which did not drop any loot upon killing.<br />
<br />
-The Direfang note is right by the Prisoner in the Sithar Jail part, look on the ground it's about the size of a toothpick (In-game toothpick, so pretty f*****g small).</div></div><hr />

Is this still true?  Or has it been addressed?  A guild bard and I have finally completed it and don't want to end up not being able to get the mask.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
- Mask of the Feral Warrior is now Bind on Equip and no longer Sellable<br />
<br />
I suppose I just found my answer, but any additional information is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Yea ist BOE now. Back when I did mine, when it was bugged and the<br />
crafter that made it couldnt trade it to you. All you did then is send<br />
a GM a letter and got the mask the next day in the mail.<br />
 <br />
But you shouldnt have a problem now since its BOE.</div></div><hr />

Just watch out she doesn't have a title or sub title to hint you that she sells stuff, just need to highlight over npcs to see if they sell anything.</div></div><hr />
