<br />
1.  Can all the creatures from the books be made and fitted with abilities exactly like in the books?<br />
<br />
For instance an arch demon or maybe one of the princes of hell types.  Would be awesome getting these mobs ingame, raise the mob level above level 20 say level 30 and get yer group of 20th level heroes to try kill this level 30 mob  <br />
<br />
2. Friend made a drow (appearance anyhow).  Is there an ability to actually create the races powers/abilities for use as a PC?<br />
<br />
Would go a long way into creating sub classes etc<br />
<br />

It's getting them ingame, that is the holdup. Only a hand full of people can import models in the game with limited success. it's a LONG drawn out process.<br />
<br />
As for recreating abilites, there are a few tutorials for making new spells and such, plus you can custom any creature in NW atm upto lvl 40 and modify it's stats anyway you please.<br />
<br />
I have a few RAID Mob that I've created that need 30+ ppl to kill.<br />

Give me some time to finish discecting their mods and I'll let you know how it is done.</div></div><hr />
