Yeah we are all called Assassins and are able poison you so much that you cannot move or do anything else in a sec.<br />
<br />
Recipes found in library. For me I prefer Snake Poisons.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I run around for fun killing a wolf only with a high-dosed dotting poison. (means to kill it over time in around 2 or 3 min)<br />
<br />
I prefer Snow Cougars for this and after this I hope its Pelt (cutted off with my Ragebringer &amp;lt;- my sharp dirk) is of a high quality. <br />
<br />
If you have any other questions read the FAQ first. Not anyone is allowed to be here and we track people down to their home which try to spy on us.<br />

<br />
This is all a game to me. I was a chemistry major for a time in college, but that's about it   Master Apothecary (200)<br />
Master Fletcher (188)<br />
Master Potter (167)<br />
Master Baker (148)<br />
Master Smith (135)<br />
Master Tailor (127)<br />
Master Brewer (102)<br />

yes those poisons are part of the game everquest.<br />
if some people do make poison in real life, it's not directly related to us =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">10-04-02, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that I have reached 250 skill and have created a Grandmaster Assassin's Vial, I do believe I might start using poisons for specific situations.<br />
<br />
Especially to take down that annoying Ranger that has been taunting me since the last time he snared and bow-kited me...he shall feel the power of my poisons, yes.<br />
<br />
The Enchanter who mezzed me and toyed around with me for twenty minutes, he too shall feel the power of my poisons, yes...<br />
<br />
yessss....<br />

 Edit: upon re-reading the original post - this is a forum for the ROLE PLAYING GAME of EVERQUEST.  This is not an &quot;Anarchists Cookbook&quot; type site telling you how to make REAL poisons for use in the REAL world.

<br />
&quot;Camping leads to phat lewt, Phat lewt leads to twinking, Twinking leads to the DARKSIDE.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So do I feel superior to any druid-twinked post-Kunark still-sucking-at-his-mother's-teat rogue? You better believe I do!!&quot; - Delissandra Splitshadow <br />
