<br />
I have given much thought to the event my noted rogues, and I am sorry to state that I cannot come up with an event that will truly test all of the skills that make a rogue as versatile as the profession is.<br />
This saddens me, because with a profession as capable in so many different aspects of life, we will only be able to test those skills that define the combat capabilities that each of you possess.<br />
<br />
Pickpocket of another character has been disallowed by the gods, therefore would require those individuals that tend to be out of control of the avatars of Norrath. Anytime you are dealing with these beings (NPC) many things can and usually go wrong.<br />
<br />
Poisons are a trademark of the rogues, and I have only one request on the topic, this being that no blindness poisons are applied and used against each other. This is to ensure that the matches are based on true skill and trickery, not a false trickery granted by a poison.<br />
<br />
Pick Locks, while a needed skill in some of the greatest dungeons in the realm, are far away from the Arena that we hold the events in. This also holds true for Sense and Disarm traps, which are hundreds of miles from the arena zone.<br />
<br />
Instill Doubt has been requested to be disallowed by a council of rogues that met in the Arena this past week. After showing that a single success of this skill results in an undoubted win, it was outlawed from the event. This skill should not be considered “useless” by any means, just too strong to be using against each other in this duel.<br />
<br />
Disarm, on the other hand, will be allowed in the event. It will take a quick hand to disarm a rogue in motion, and an even quicker hand to pull out another dagger from a nearby sheath. This skill cannot be ignored and will remain in the event.<br />
<br />
Activateable items will be disallowed. Needless to say those bringing earrings that can lifetap, potions that can heal or negate poisons will negate damage done to them not out of skill, but out of the wealth of a rogue that can afford such luxuries. Items that have these abilities can still be worn, just not used.<br />
<br />
Hide and Sneak is a no-win situation for the judges, contestants, and participants. If we allow hide and sneak, everyone who enters the ring will have see invis gear on so they can engage their opponent at all times. The only thing hide and sneak will accomplish is to take away the event from the crowd who has come to see the greatest rogues fight each other. <br />
<br />
Therefore we are going to disallow hide and sneak in this event so that the rogues can wear items that will allow them to increase their combat efficiency and allow everyone to see the great action.<br />
<br />
Backstabbing is allowed and encouraged. Since this is normally the most damage that a rogue can do to an opponent, of course it will be allowed.<br />
<br />
The use of ranged weapons for the rogues is another profession defining ability. I must state that the bow is not allowed, but other weapons of ranged attacks will be granted. Also be advised that ‘kiting’ will not be allowed. <br />
<br />
This leaves a lot of room for interpretation of this statement, so I will make an all encompassing rule that states you can only attack via range once, then reengage with melee. Now if you wish to throw a dagger, melee once, back off, throw another dagger, that is allowed. As long as there is melee between the ranged attacks, you may engage as much as you desire.<br />
<br />
There was a rule with the warriors, which stated they must face each other at all times in combat, therefore not allowing for “Constructive Fleeing”. If you wish to turn your back on a fellow rogue, knowing full well their capabilities of attacks from the back, both melee and ranged, you may do so. I expect low life expectancy for those who turn their backs to a rogue, and highly advise against it.<br />
<br />
(OOC) The rule of Link-Death has been reviewed, and it was determined to modify the standing of this rule. If you go Link-Dead and are losing, you forfeit the match. If you go Link-Dead and are winning the match, the battle will be reviewed by the GM for a rematch. The option of disqualifying the Link-Dead player is still given to the judge, even if winning, but the Judge has the option to call for a rematch now.<br />
<br />
These are the current rules of the event, and I assure you that they are still open for discussion and revision up to the point of the first match (Prexus – Wed at 5pm). I have worked with many rogues to try to find another event that will fit within time restraints so all servers can run them, that spectators can watch the glorious event, and that are fair to the profession that is involved.<br />
<br />
Good luck to the Rogues, we shall see you at the event!<br />

<br />
False trickery based on something that is made by rogues.  I'm sorry but this just cracked me up.  So what is the difference between real trickery and fake trickery?  How can you be sure real trickery isn't fake, but just really clever about it?<br />

Guess it's turning out like people said.  Gonna be a big old melee contest between mini-warriors.<br />

NONE, ok well lets look at melee well if you talk damage = str and stuff, well again you lookin at a barb maybe dwarf,  ...... ok um procing you lookin at just about any race. <br />
<br />
Well there you have it guys, the winner of the rogue contest will be a barb rogue, useing poison, trowing borders, and stuning you,  pretty sad that it comes to this as a contest for rogues. <br />

That skill is backstab. Its like a forced crit on the warriors perspective and i for one will not participate in this &quot;test of skills&quot;. This competition is all about whos got the best stuff. And wait... its not even that because someones decided that weapons earned from the hardest parts of the game are not allowable! (bloodpoint). Im sorry but i refuse to participate and will mock any or all who consider themselves a &quot;king of thieves&quot; for winning that sickening debacle of a competition.<br />

Considering we have the same skill cap as a ranger i would say disallowing archery is like disallowing us to use 1hb weapons, It may not fit the most popular vision of a rogue but it in no way invalidates it either (need I mention Robin Hood?).  This ruling displeases me greatly, all rogues have had a choice and option to train themselves in the uses of all weapons available to them, and none should be restricted. it is up to personal preferance.  To me Thrown weapons will never be more than a nice toy to play with until they decide to put in decent items that are usable by the majority of rogue races and are stackable.<br />
<br />
No Hide/Sneak?  hmm.. rogues arent toe-to-toe fighters, there may even be a official quote to that effect somewhere.  The use of subterfuge and distraction is paramount to a rogues concept and strategy.  I ask what is the difference between the disparity of a rbb and a dual wielding blood point rogue and that of a non-hasted dual SBD wielding rogue?  Obviously the rules dont account for the obvious advantage the first rogue would have.  But yet there is a distinction made with hide/sneak?  Whats fair after all, if the rules allowed activatable items, once selected a rogues location could be verified via item casting or ranged weapon.  It is up to the individual rogue to plan for strategies that may be used against him/her and to plan so that any advantages may be negated or turned against their attacker.  One could even play the possum so to speak in luring an opponent into thinking they didnt see them until an opportunity arose.  <br />
<br />
well thats my 2 cents on the rules. Machieaveli Shadowstalker  lvl 49 Rogue on Rallos Zek</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would much rather see naked rogues duking it out with fine steel weapons of their choice.  As it stands the supremely high level characters with uber-gear will mow their foes with minimum effort.<br />
<br />
There are potentially rogues out there with dual bloodpoints with near full suits of Mrylokar ( I know one with helm, arms, 2 bracers, boots &amp;amp; legs).<br />

Don't have a rune branded girdle/Cloak of Flames level item?  Don't show up.<br />

<br />
And instill doubt would be cheap, and it would result in a win to whoever got it off first.  I think it will just come down to some guy who has full woven shadow/mryolakar's and uses fanged skull stilletos and blood points.<br />
<br />
In other words, just like the warrior contest:  It's not a battle of skill, it's a battle of gear.<br />
<br />
... I DO wish they did contests and stuff for all levels...  My guys ALWAYS have near-uber gear, cause I trade too much.  I'd win.  Oh yes.<br />

My only haste item is a hangmans noose (worse haste then FBSS), and personally I think I have an above average chance of winning (or at least doing well in) my server competition.<br />
<br />
Some people will lose (or not even try) simply because they think they have no chance.  Go practice fighting - become a better dueler then the other rogues, and no matter what gear you use or what level you are, you have a good chance.<br />
<br />
If dueling doesnt interest you then dont go. the rogue BoB, just like the warrior one, is a dueling competition. Its not a level competition, or a item competition - people who think so havent dueled enough to know how hard you get owned (no matter your level or gear) by someone whos a superior dueler.  <br />

<br />
But, no denying that bad ass gear does &quot;help&quot; but its not THE determining factor for whether or not you win.  There are so many strategies to dueling, and ways to hit without being hit.  I have won almost every duel ive ever done, even against a some non-rogues.  Some of the rogues I fought had just as good, if not better, gear than I, but i was still able to triumph.<br />
<br />
I wish that they would have put more thought into this competion, but they just made it into a bloodfest.  If thats what they want, then thats all they are going to get.  In (almost) no way does this show a rogues &quot;true&quot; abilties.  Oh well...<br />

<br />
I can see why they don't allow procing weapons, Imagine a Rogue with 2 Bloodpoints and an Ontenbrate Short Sword. It would turn into a proc match.<br />
<br />
The warrior contest was a good idea because Warriors basically step up to the mob and hack hack hack hack. I know there is more to being a good tank than that, but in a general sense, that is how warriors duel.<br />
<br />
I can also see why they had a hard time coming up with good contest rules since Rogues do so many things.<br />
<br />
In the end, I think they should have had the Rogue contest down the road a bit. Maybe by that time they could have figured out a better way to determine the Rogue King. But then again, maybe not.<br />
<br />
Well, I hope it will be fun for the poeple who compete. I just wish the people on my server who are in the Burning Woods and Karnor zones would realize how great Rogues are in battle. Took me 4 and a half hours today to get a group. it is getting bad   <br />

<br />
You cannot poison weapons, you poison the primary weapon slot.<br />
So, you can put whatever piercing weapon you want there, you can only poison one shot.<br />
<br />
Then you have to reapply poison. (Which would be suicide in the duel)<br />
<br />
And besides, the rules say that only ONE poison per fight will be allowed.</div></div><hr />

You had better be a good strafer, hehe. Oh and BTW, whats up with those messed up times?! 4pm on a Monday? Are they on crack!? <br />

Think of it all they have to do is make all of the spectators red along with the rogues just for the duration on the compititon.  Then I will be passing through the audiance stealing all of the money  .  Come on that is the only way to show the king of THIEVES now if they want to find out who is the best rogue well there are plenty of better ways to do it.  A best of the best fight is aghanst the very nature of my rogue.  I know I am the best I dont need to prove it to you and if you are all going to be at the compititon it will make it easier for me to get into and back out of the bank with your stuff.  And speaking about applying poison I apply several times during a duel but that requires sneak hide and they took that away now didnt they. If your going to traverse thin ice you might as well dance your way across</div></div><hr />

For all the hard work this board and everyone on it has put in to trying to make our class the best it can be, this contest mocks us in every fashion. We spent a VERY LONG friggin time waiting for that poison upgrade and myself has spent around 15k getting it up past 204. For them to limit us in using ANY of our given abilties defeats the purpose of both the Safehouse and the rest of the rogues who don't visit us playing that race. If you wish to &quot;go along&quot; because you want some little title on your name then i can hardly see how you can manage to call yourself a rogue in the truest sense of the word.<br />

<br />
Did you attend the open forum Lady D had on the Test Server to discuss alternatives?  There was your opportunity to make this event better, rather than post here after the fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dove Whispersilk</div><div class="date">09-21-00, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">allowing hide sneak is pointless - everyone 55+ has (or has access to borrow) a permanent see invis item, that skill is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Instill doubt is an auto-win if it goes off. I think lady Dae doesnt want it to be a match of who gets their one shot kill move off first (this isnt Killer Instinct guys).<br />
<br />
Blind poison is banned because it lasts a LONG time. If it was allowed every rogue would use it and the first 3 minutes of every duel would be both rogues running around not hitting anything, and probobly one (or both) of them running outside the arena and being disqualified. Its obvious why blind is not allowed.<br />
<br />
I dont think there could be better rules for a rogue dueling contest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Chemistrius</div><div class="date">09-21-00, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually blind doesn't stick to well to post 50 peps and critters.  If you're willing to bet your one poison on one that's highly resisted, then that should be your choice.<br />
<br />
Using poisons for a long time now has tought me that there are those that stick well to anything and there are those that rarely stick.  A poison might look good on paper, but in a battle they usually work a little different.<br />
<br />
But hey, what the heck do I know about it anyway, I'm only level 53, I couldn't possibly qualify as a good rogue yet. &lt;u&gt;Chemistrius Ul'Veldrin***&lt;/u&gt;<br />

<br />
The guild i founded on quellious sent a representative though and i still highly doubt my voice would of changed the fact that lady D or whoever would of changed the rules. She knew exactly what was going to happen if it came down to a fight no doubt and i still cant for a minute believe anyone would participate in this.</div></div><hr />

What are we WARRIORS?<br />
<br />
I say we ALL show up and flood the square with a SAFEHOUSE PROTEST!<br />
<br />
They go wow look at all the rogues who wish to compete.<br />
<br />
Then the server Ring Warden steps forward and announces  that &quot;We the rogues of the Safehouse DENOUNCE this contest  for the mockery that it is. If you want to hold this contest, go get some WARROIRS instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyone willing to bet the first person to Circle Strafe gets disqualifyed for exploiting?<br />
<br />
And if they allow proc weapons the winner will most likely have a jagged shard of bone.<br />

I won't attend this joke of an event unless we all go to protest it. Dazzler Twodirks<br />
