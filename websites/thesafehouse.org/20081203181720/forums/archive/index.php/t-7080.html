Don't remember what lvl he went there at, 57 I believe (wasn't his main char at the time) He got to 60 and had DC in about a week. There is a rogue mob there he would charm, give a nice weapon and go to town. He went with the rogue mob because it had the best DPS.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.   Thodin</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for soloing ... my server is a bit bare so I probabaly have more options than you but as a level 60 enchantress I solo the Bugs/Guardian and Entrance of Seb I can solo the drop down spot in Velks Lower Dogs.  Geonids in WL.  Can solo in Akheva.  Lots of different places we can use to solo although don't worry about your charisma as much as your mana/hp.  Make sure you have your dots and forlorn deeds and root loaded.<br />

He wouldn't use exploits, period. He has been playing the game a very long time and is very knowledgeable about the game.<br />
<br />
I do know he died a few times when charm broke, and had trouble getting the 15k weapon (not sure what weapon so don't ask) he gave to the mob back some times. He mostly died when my friend warrior would log on   Thodin</div></div><hr />
