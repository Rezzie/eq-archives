<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lianaya</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember when everyone was saying how great Dungeon Siege was and eventually broke down and got it. That game got tired real fast. By the time I finished the single player I had no desire to continue with multiplayer game. I dont want to take a bath on another game,so Im looking for specific comments from those playing it.  Why is this game fun? What existing game does NWN compare to?  How long does the game stay fresh before it degenerates to something that gets on your nerves?  Thanks<br />

<br />
There's a lot of persistent world type servers being run that vary in style from being kinda like a diablo/DnD hybrid to being kinda like an EQ/DnD hybrid.<br />
<br />
For a more DnD/DnD hybrid experience, I'd recommend playing w/ some friends with someone running as an active DM.  You can only simulate DnD so much w/o having a person actively involved real-time as DM.<br />

PS: I think it's worth it.  Ever since I started playing the online version I'm like &quot;Everwhat?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Its fun, but multi is much better if you get a server with little or no lag.</div></div><hr />
