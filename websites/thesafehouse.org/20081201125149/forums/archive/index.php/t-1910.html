<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ten Evenings</div><div class="date">10-14-03, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, Id like to preface this by saying I was born in WV, and lived in Columbus, Ohio for most of my life. My 'look' was pretty rare, and got a few weird stares (not the all outs like goth kids get, but you know what I mean).<br />
<br />
I go into a QVC with my gf. Were in the produce aisle looking at tomatoes or whatever, and I look up. Over near the avacados is another two of us.<br />
<br />
Let me explain: I am a tall, white male with short dark hair, hipster duck glasses, dirt wash jeans, a thrift store teeshirt thats a size too tight, brown cord truckers jacket, pair of Converses, with two rings in my lower lip.<br />
<br />
My gf is short, Japanese, wearing bascially the same thing I am (hipster-posers like us can share wardrobes).<br />
<br />
Across the way is a tall, white male with short dark hair, hipster duck glasses, cords, a black sweatshirt with some obscure indie band's name on it, pair of Cons, with two rings in his lower lip.<br />
<br />
His gf is short, Asian, and wearing basically the same thing he, my gf, and I am.<br />
<br />
What in the f*ck?<br />
<br />
I mean, I know my thing isnt exactly rare. If I dressed like an eighteenth century French dandy, I might have more wiggle room. But I usually dont see anyone that looks EXACTLY like me when I go out, unless Im at a show or something.<br />
<br />
But at the freaking grocery store? Two rings in the lower lip? Asian girlfriend/ white boyfriend? Converses? All four of us together at the same damn time?!<br />
<br />
Seattle is great and all, but if that ever happens again, Im moving to Montana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh it is. There is a notable distinction between being 'hip' and being grungy. Usually, it revolves around the cost of your accesories(watch, rings, sunglasses, tatoos) and the amount of dirt you let get in your clothes before you wash them. Grunge!= cheap stuff, torn up clothes, dirty clothes.<br />
Hip!= cheap stuff, tastefully worn clothes, and pricey accesories. <br />
<br />
For the record, I loathe pre-dirtied jeans that sell for $80. You have to be some kind of winner to pay extra money for someone to get your clothes dirty, before you wear them. Or to pre-wear the hem of jeans so you can have that &quot;rugged&quot; look. I have tons of jeans that are shredded, and each pair reminds me of all the places I've been, all the mud I've trumped through, all the stuff I've kicked. People paying a lot of money for that surface image makes me want to puke. <br />
<br />
I just have to ask Ten Evenings, does your GF have a sun burst or celtic tatoo right above her crack on her lower back? &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;<br />

Comming from the northwest to LA, people expect me to bitch aboutA the traffic.  I'm like, hell!  Seattle is possibly worse then LA.  Seattle has 3 freeways with almost no other major streets that go anywhere due to the screwed up geography.  LA has 20 freeways that go allover, and then still has roads that can take you long distances but slower(like the PCH, Ventura Blvd, etc).  Of course theres the orange crush, but anyone smart, or at least blessed, doesn't have to penetrate that mess every day.</div></div><hr />

Seattle is the capital of stylish poseurs.  Doesn't suprise me a bit that you saw your clone.  Wait a few years, and you'll be shopping at Larry's and Wholefoods with the rest of the pseudo-indie drones.<br />
<br />
Now a rant about the Ave would have been a good one.  Back a decade or so ago there were plenty of homeless around.  Of course it was the old-fashioned style wino bums rather than the current ave rat punk ass Bellevue runaway.  I miss the old winos.  They kept to themselves and didn't clog up the sidewalk.  The only problem with them was when they chose your doorway to pass out in.<br />
<br />
Fricking Ave rats are far worse.  Aggressive little punks think they are entitled to a handout and bug everyone they see for smokes and cash.  Interestingly enough they are usually wearing a few hundred dollars in leather and jewelry.  They clog up the sidewalk by camping out for the entire day in a little cluster of smelly laziness.  They've managed to drive a number of businesses off the Ave since it is a pain in the ass to run the gauntlet of panhandling and try to actually walk past them.  For some reason lots of them seem to think owning an aggressive dog is a good idea too.  I wish the city would just pressure wash off the sidewalks about once a day and sluice those little bastards down the drain.<br />

Anyway: No, I dont think of my girlfriend as part of my look. She dresses like I do, and the point more was me and her and the other couple were the same race/ gender mix, and all of us looked like we just fell out of a Salvation Army truck on the way to a Belle and Sebastian concert.<br />
<br />
Yes, I do look emo. I dont really like emo or indie music, Im more about bluegrass, noise, and dub... But, alas! There is no standard uniform for people with my interests, musical or otherwise, and I cannot recognize them by their paraphenilia. So, Im a clone.<br />
<br />
For the peeps who thought I was squawking about how crazy it is that theres people out there who dress exactly like me, you miss the point:<br />
<br />
Two men and two women, all dressed in almost exactly the same, same age, same race/ gender mix, same grocery store, in Wallingford (that last might go a bit towards explaining the whole thing, Im learning). Its just a silly anecdote, not a serious rant.<br />
<br />
edit: Yeah, you guys got me on the fashion thing, but I spend about twice that amount of money on jeans. I know its silly, but Id love to know what your streetwear is before you pass judgement on mine. <br />

I'm coming late to this thread, but so much of it rings true.<br />
<br />
the Aladdin Gyrocery rules. I recently moved to Capitol Hill, and am a little afraid to try the place on Broadway that reminds me of Aladdin's. Here's to hoping it's cut from the same cloth. Can't say I miss the Ave much though.. last time I was there it really didn't seem to have any kind of character or pulse left.<br />
<br />
Left-lane idiots KILL me. I envy Ciba, who was able to ditch the Seattle/Redmond commute, 'cause I still have to deal with it.<br />
<br />
Ten Evenings: Wallingford? I was SURE that you were talking about the Harvard Market QFC, and that you freqent the Cha-Cha =). <br />
<br />
$160 for jeans?!?! I pay like.... $40, tops. For plain old Levi's that last me forever. As for my look... I've never really thought of myself as a hipster, though I do go to a lot of shows and run a local website about them. It started out as what I always thought of as &quot;normal&quot;, but which came to be labelled &quot;grunge&quot;: jeans, boots, band T-shirts, and lots of layers. Over time the long hair got cut off, the jeans started getting rolled up, and I've moved away from T-shirts every day to just some of the time, mixed in with short-sleeved button-down shirts.<br />
<br />

Never wore a shirt and for a homeless guy he was in great shape.  There was a article in the Times about him, seems you can carry all sorts of weaponry as long as it isn't &quot;concealed&quot;.  <br />

 He may be a nice guy but I have yet to see any 'real change' going on there.  He's been hawking the paper in the same spot for at least 6 years.</div></div><hr />

hey Cao - he's changed it to &quot;Real Change?  Have a great day sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
he says &quot;real change&quot; in the catchiest way too - gotta love it.  That's where I shop about half the time and he's always there.</div></div><hr />

I miss being able to walk out my back door, down an alley, and be at Safeway or a halfway decent Teriyaki joint. I miss the crabmeat dumplings...</div></div><hr />

I mean, I'm not saying Toshi's isn't the bomb-diggity, but Quiznos... less than a block away from school... I don't get what the excitement about is with teriyaki when you can eat toasted subs for the same price.</div></div><hr />

My friend works at the Quiznos in the U District, and tries to get me to go in there once in a while - but I just don't like it.<br />

By the way - have I ever mentioned that this   emoticon looks exactly like Absor for some reason?  I think its the eerie quasi-tint of his glasses.</div></div><hr />
