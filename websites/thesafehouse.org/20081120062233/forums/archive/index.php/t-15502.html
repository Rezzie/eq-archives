<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-12-04, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I figured I'd start a thread with some tips that I've discovered that weren't immediately obvious to me when I started playing the game.  Some are more useful than others, but maybe it will help somebody out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
--Right clicking a guard will give you an option to find an NPC in the area.  All you have to do is type in their name and the guard will point the way with a glowing path that leads right up to the NPC you are looking for.  Extremely useful for those classes that don't have track (and when the track list gets really cluttered).<br />
<br />
--If you find anything unusual, make sure to go into your inventory, right click on it, and 'examine' it.  A lot of quests are started this way!<br />
<br />
--You can share some items across bank accounts with characters who play on the same side on the same server.  I wish I would have known this before making characters on other servers.<br />
<br />
--Some merchants give you better deals than others.  I'm not sure what guides it, but I definately get more money selling to different vendors.<br />
<br />
--Don't get too used to double left clicking things to talk to them like you can do in the city!  I accidentally attacked an NPC that I was trying to talk to in the Crosslands last night this way (he killed me in one blow, hehe).<br />
<br />
--Be efficient with your quests.  Often you can complete several quests at once by killing the same thing.<br />
<br />
--If you right click on your hotbar there are options to add additional hotbars.  These are hotkeyed by default to be a number with another button (like alt+1 for the first hotkey, for example).<br />
<br />
--Some monsters of the same con are a lot harder than others!  If you see a triangle or two above their heads, they are tougher than they con and will probably require a group.  Even grey mobs like this can cause you trouble.  You can also con them and it will say if they are tougher than they look.</div></div><hr />

Easy way to get around this is to change you keyboard settings so that single clicks will initiate dialog, open merchants, open doors...etc etc, but WILL NOT INITIATE combat.  It will save you alot of unwanted grief.</div></div><hr />

Also handy for zoning when running across city zones -- just right cluick the door and and as soon as you are close enough to zone the text lights up. ;)</div></div><hr />

Worked that way in beta .. doesnt in live unfortunatly .. I use to do the same thing.. and it no longer works in live.. but still not hard to zone unless you try to zone into a zone that has more than 1 instnace.. that can be a pain lol when being chased by nasty things bent on your destruction.</div></div><hr />
