<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">04-17-04, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Phase 2 is off to a game changing start. Rest states, hearthstones, sap changes, etc. are big changes to the game. <br />
<br />
I'm only level 7 as my highest character presently (they locked our Alpha and Beta 1 characters). So far the biggest change that's affected me has been the way skill point are earned. You gain 1 point for every 300 unmodified xp points gained by killing mobs. <br />
<br />
It now takes around 10 skill points instead of 1 or 2 to begin apprentice level of a trade skill (actual points required varies). Certain attributes are also increased by skill points now (agility costs me 1 skill point to raise as a rogue). <br />
<br />
I'll be posting more as I test and will do a new rogue review down the line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I live my WoW life vicariously through your reports Fricka, keep them coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">04-18-04, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DOh! I picked the wrong beta if I intended to stalk Fricka I guess heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantom Rogue</div><div class="date">04-18-04, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You and 99% of the people who applied for beta :)<br />
<br />
Which isnt really testing much at all, 1000 people isnt much of a stress test, you will have prolly 100,000 people lining up within the first week to play.  Its a blizzard title, its gonna pull in people from the name alone, let alone the MMO niche, and then the RPG niche.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JookaWoo</div><div class="date">04-18-04, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone else find it incredible funny that the rest system is supposed to convince you to not farm mobs over long periods of time and pursue other activites, yet all skills are earned from farming mobs also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wasn't it like 400,000 people signing up for beta in just 1 week?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">04-19-04, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Launch is gonna be terible unless they suddenly invite 50k people into beta for a stress test... Seems every MMORG has issues with that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">04-20-04, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I better be one of the ones they invite too.  Dammit I have gotten into every single beta I have signed up for.  (CoH slipped in at the last second but I got my letter)<br />
<br />
I want in!  I have tradeskills to do and things to skin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">04-21-04, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know the feeling, I've been channeling my non beta rage into killing people in Desert Combat.  Suck at planes, cant fly a chopper, so so with tanks, but man will I own you with small arms.  Got 89 kills in Basrah nights, 90percent running scoped (thank you ravenshield).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">04-21-04, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chopper pilot in DC here heh. I've lost track of the number of times I'll fire up DC just to practice flying. Occasionally still flip it upside down when I over-react, but over all not a bad pilot. we should get all teh safehousers together some night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but how many of them were people usin multiple addresses ;) <br />
<br />
I know of at least 4 people who did it, and im sure a good deal of the 400,000 were like them ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JookaWoo</div><div class="date">04-22-04, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember a post from GF saying after the screened out the multi sign ups as best they could it was around 250k still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess who got an email this morning??  THWICK!! YES! Sorry to rub it in anyone's face, i'm just so excited.  I met a kid on campus that plays it and is friendly with the blizzard people, he got me in.  Guess it pays to know some people.    :float  :beer  :float  Okay, you can all kill me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would kill you...if my wife didn't get into the beta and have to put up with me using her account.  O=&gt;</div></div><hr />
