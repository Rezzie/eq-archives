Not the people on it, not the guild politics, but the actual hardware that runs it. The drives, and networking gear, and whatever else would cause all of your casters to lose the ability to cast ANY spells...<br />
<br />
Especially when you have 11 Rathe Council members down to 3-4% health, and are pulling the 12th to finally beat this pain in the ass event.<br />
<br />
In 4.5+ years of playing this stupid game, I can honestly say that this is the most pissed off, frustrated, and- hell, there are not enough words to describe it.<br />
<br />
So, will have to wait till next time to finish that last flag. <br />
<br />
Grats Sony/VI/Whoever on some really, REALLY incredible timing. <br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />

Because I felt like bitching and prefer to post behind the locked doors of the safehouse instead of a general forum where every non-rogue a-hole gets off on flaming people.<br />
<br />
If the best you can do is try to flame me for posting in the wrong forum, then keep your comments to yourself, or take yourself to the ranthall and find something else to comment on.</div></div><hr />
