    I've noticed items are quite more expensive than a blue server, but the other day, i had some money saved after buying myself a bloodstained fang, and a cristalized shadow rapier, and i decided to buy a dwarven ringmail tunic for my mr, a guy asked for 400pp. Was he kidding? Or will my mr stay down for some more time?</div></div><hr />
