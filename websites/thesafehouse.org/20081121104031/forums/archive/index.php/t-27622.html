<br />
DIPLOMACY<br />
- Diplomacy: Many cities and towns now have a Diplomacy focus point. The focus point is a set of bulletin boards surrounding a pillar or tree. These focus points have been placed in significant areas in cities, towns, and outposts and are intended to be gathering places for diplomats. Cities that are slated to have Civic Diplomacy active in the next couple of weeks have a whole bulletin board and complete pillar or tree. Cities that will have Civic Diplomacy soon, but not immediately, have a burned down board and broken pillar. Note that all of these focus points are NOT operational at this time!<br />
- Diplomacy: Diplomacy focus points placed in Bordinar's Cleft, Tursh, Rindol Field, Three Rivers, Renton Keep, Leth Nurae, Veskal's Exchange, Misthaven Crossing, Halgarad, Dahknarg, Konarthi Point, Tahean's Vengeance, Lomshir, Hathor Zhi, Pankor Zhi, Khal, Ahgram, Mekalia, Oasis, Afrit, Zarabadi Landing, Tanvu, Ca'ail Brael, and Martok.<br />
- Diplomacy: New decks for newbie line third tier opponents have been made.<br />
- Diplomacy: Varanjar and Lesser Giant line decks should be fixed. Decks should be of the appropriate difficulty at the appropriate time. Apparently impossibly hard to beat is just too hard.<br />
- Diplomacy: Graag the Ripper no longer kills you if you beat him in parley. He will still kill you if you fail against him.<br />
- Diplomacy: Graag and friends will now spawn more efficiently at the fighting pit, and despawn more appropriately.<br />
- Diplomacy: Fai Lin Aurora now correctly tells you she is teleporting you to Mount Fajin.<br />
- Diplomacy: Other fixes for the varanthari newbie Diplomacy progression.<br />
- Diplomacy: Veskal's Exchange Civic Diplomacy is now active. It has one Station: Soldiers. <br />
- Diplomacy: Civic Diplomacy has had its Presence requirements updated in Konarthi Point.<br />
- Diplomacy: High elf newbie Diplomacy is now open in Leth Nurae! Seek out Arianna Lanendril, who will start you on the path toward serving the Eternal Rose, and gaining the love of the queen.<br />
- Diplomacy: All races can now learn Diplomacy.<br />
- Diplomacy: Modified Presence values for all existing Diplomacy Head, Chest, Neck, Held, Back, Hand, Waist, Legs items to intended values.</div></div><hr />
