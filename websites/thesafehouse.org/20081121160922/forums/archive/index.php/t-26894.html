<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Narsarius</div><div class="date">11-21-06, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guild Leviathan is a group of players from a variety of MMORPGs with years of experience. We are all looking for dedicated people who are willing to put in the time and effort to see the end-game. <br />
<br />
What makes us different from other guilds? We are not ran by one leader, instead the guild is lead by three. Together we have pulled from all of our past MMORPG experience and created a set of DKP rules and general rules that we feel will benefit that guild and the players in the guild. <br />
<br />
What makes us creditable? Some of our roots go back to 1999 where we started with Everquest beta. We sought out to make the game enjoyable as well as seeing the end content and striving to win. The leaders of Leviathan have led guilds in the past, have played in top end guilds, and been the best of the best player wise. <br />
<br />
Our current raid schedule will be centered around Wednesday through Saturday once our members have reached sufficient level for continuous raiding. Changes in the raid structure of the game are not finalized, once changed we will adjust our raiding schedule and requirements accordingly. Recruitment before the game release is open to all classes. However, this will be sure to change once we are in game. Before the game begins, we still want to get to know our members, so we will have our Ventrilo server open, and we will coordinate weekly times when everyone will try to log in together. <br />
<br />
Other things to look forward to in Leviathan are: personalized DKP system, a guild banking system viewable by members, years and years of experience, and a variety of leadership styles that will result in a greater understanding of members. <br />
