We are Ex Umbris, we come from the shadows to protect the future of Telon.<br />
<br />
Ex Umbris is a pre-release community guild that is forming up now.  If you are interested in a core guild that is focused on everything that the game will bring us.  We are more focused on PvE than anything else, but we have Crafters, Diplomats, PvPers and RPers in our ranks and we are looking for good players to help us form our guild and join us for The Long Wait.  So come and share your ideas with us.<br />

<br />
Ex Umbris (Out of the Shadows) is very excited by the launch of beta 3! <br />
<br />
We are a “core” guild that will play the game for fun. We are not casuals or hardcore. We will be raiding on a regular basis. We will have members on all three continents in-game. Our members are currently located from GMT -8 (PST) to GMT +2, (we will not be limiting recruitment to these time zones). We are looking for mature, quality players from the pre-release community. Our guild’s interest run the gamut: Adventuring, raiding, crafting, diplomacy, harvesting, trading, building a guild town, and ships.<br />
<br />
We are working very hard on our web site, and lore.<br />
<br />

Ex Umbris Charter (http://ex-umbris.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=15)<br />

<br />
The basic tenants of eXu lore include: <br />
<br />
-There is a Spiritual Force at work that selects people to have &quot;the call&quot; <br />
-Ex Umbris is thousands of years old and has existed under a great myriad of leaders and has built up an eccentric feel after all this time <br />
-The Ex Umbris &quot;Vaults&quot; were built thousands of years ago when a Dwarf ran eXu. <br />
-Most of the previous generation are finding and selecting our characters and trying to continue the Order. <br />
-Most members are spread out around the world doing what they can to make the &quot;world a better place&quot;. <br />
-&quot;The Call&quot; manifests itself as a driving need to get out into the world and make a difference. <br />
<br />
We are a role-play friendly guild and have a role-play background that we encourage members to add to, however we do not require any form of role-play from our members.  <br />
<br />
We are still recruiting and now have a formalized application process. We require the following information when you apply: <br />
<br />

<br />
New applicants are still welcome to stop by and apply for membership as we have not set a hard cap to our guild size.  We just won't be posting monthly recruitment up-dates anymore.<br />
<br />
We have attracted many quality 'core' players and look forward to seeing you in-game at launch.<br />

We want to stop by and say hello!  Many quality gamers have joined us since our last up-date and we have room for more.  <br />

<br />
If you are looking for a pre-launch guild that has a diversity of members from around the world, you are welcome to visit Ex Umbris (http://www.ex-umbris.com/).  Our membership application and additional information can be found here (http://www.ex-umbris.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=133).<br />
<br />
We are nearing the hardcap size for our guild.  Our original plan was to close open recruitment at Beta 5 but we may decide to end enrollments before then.  When we freeze our membership we are going to be revising our recruitment policy.  No new members will be added to the guild until a month after launch.  <br />
<br />
The details of our new policy will be revealed later but now is the time to act if you want to be a full member of Ex Umbris at launch!</div></div><hr />
