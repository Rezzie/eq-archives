<br />
anygame.<br />
<br />
Mine would be in a D&amp;amp;D game.<br />
After losing his dark elf to a chair of slay living, my friend brought in a moon elf rogue. He got promptly eaten by a roper.<br />

<br />
Then in Star-Wars d20 just a few weekends ago the GM had me going to ask some questions to two Dark Jedi in an apartment. (Dark Campaign)  Knocked on the door and got two questions out before they open the door and cut me in half.  (1st level characters.  The GM had killed off 5 PC's just trying to introduce everyone together.  What got me was that he kept putting them in situations where they started out against eachother.  This obviously lead to immediate deaths due to the first level affliction of 'One-Hit-Kill')</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">06-12-03, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">had a character in shadowrun that I made, the day after the movie &quot;assassins&quot; came out. so I made an assassin character, took an hour and a half or so to do it because I was spending all of his A-level resources on weapons and toys. and after writing it all down he died 20 minutes into the adventure to a bug spirit that ate him as he was flying around on his paramilitary glider. I think it was the dm's way of saying &quot;I don't want you playing this character. go back to your old one&quot;.<br />
<br />
in one of our first d&amp;amp;d campaigns, back when I was 15 and making constant drizzt ranger clones, I died trying to kill a goblin king that was much higher level than me. I figured, since I was a drizzt clone and all, I should be able to kill anything, and promptly got wasted. <br />
<br />
so I just kinda came in with a clone of that guy when the group finished the combat, and then ended up dying to a trap. and after we got out of the dungeon and climbed down into a ravine, the dm decided to have us ambushed by some drow who promptly killed me in two hits (even though it was magically dark and I couldn't see them.....).<br />
<br />
after that I made a new character who wasn't a good drow ranger with purple eyes</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I remember correctly, someone had shown up late for a session and needed a character. The character entered play while the person was still rolling stats. Somehow, the character died while the stats were still being figured out, and the guy didn't notice until he finished and announced that he was ready to play. For some reason, he couldn't figure out why everyone was laughing at him for saying that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a guy who had never played before but who would come by every now and then and watch.  We tried to persuade him to make a character and play, and finally he decided to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
So, the GM and he get together and make a character for him.  He is being held captive in this wizards tower.  The party shows up to kill the bad guy wizard.  They rescue the new PC and then in the next room there is the bad guy wizard.  New guy charges wizard but misses.<br />
<br />
So, the party wizard says &quot;I throw a firejet at the badguy&quot;<br />
<br />
GM:  You realise you might hit this guy?<br />
<br />
PW:  I never miss!  *rolls dice and misses - hitting new guy instead for max damage*<br />
<br />
The new guy never played again.  His roleplaying experience lasted less than 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">06-16-03, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember some of my [Orignal] D&amp;amp;D characterters.  I always loved playing elves because they were basiclly fighters with spells.  Problem was that they kept starting us at 1st level.  Several times we meet up at a tavern and wander out in search of adventure.  I left a few characters at the bottom of 10' pits.  Several were killed by Kobolds of all things. Another tripped and rolled down a slope, killing him.<br />
  Decided to try a cleric because he could heal.  To young to make the connection that we were generally getting one hit killed so no matter how much healing we were still dead.  Well they had gone off without me one gaming night and one of the players actually surivied the first hit.  Next gaming night he was at the tavern.  Roleplaying a pissed fighter he was screaming at people and such.   I went up and knocked on his door and he kicked it open to answer it yelling &quot;Its about time you show up, Heal me!&quot;  GM decided I was standing to close to the door.  Fighter killed me when the door hit me (1d4+Strength). He didnt get healed.<br />
  A wizard I made once hit on a bar wench and she slapped him for one point, killing him.<br />
  A pixie killed a fighter I made too.  Got tired of getting killed in one shot.  The pixie took me out with three arrows.  But at least I survivied the first shot.<br />
<br />
  I think it was after the wizard getting killed by the bar wench that we decided characters would start at 3rd level. Edited by: Urusai at: 6/16/03 7:42 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to let characters live through a few sessions, some, or all of them will get below 0 hps quite often, but still manage to survive.<br />
That might be 'cause I get quite attached to my characters as well, so I don't like to kill others.<br />
<br />
However, there is one exception.<br />
<br />
There is this frined of mine that loves to play ogre-magi.<br />
<br />
I think his latest too is Ghul-Dahn VII<br />
Maybe those H are not in the right places, I really can't remember.<br />
<br />
And that was while everyone else in the group was still using his first, or in some cases second character.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vorashus</div><div class="date">08-08-03, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this happened to one of my players in a rather extensive campaign that we played for roughly 2 years in 2nd ed D&amp;amp;D.<br />
<br />
About a year into the campaign, a friend of ours who had started the campaign with us and went off to college returned for the summer and wanted to make a new character instead of bringing back his original character (Minotaur warrior, prince of his people, yadda yadda)... The thing to know about this guy, even though he is a really good friend, is that he is a horrible gamer. He the kindve player who never actually contributes... just sits in the background, makes the occasional unfunny comment, and rolls dice. <br />
<br />
So he rolls up a Psionicist (a class that i hated in the first place). He joins up with the adventuring band, as at that point they were traveling one of the large trading highways accross wilderness in the world that i had created. I didnt have it out for his character, but the one thing that i cannot stand is when a player makes a completely stupid, stupid decision. <br />
<br />
Heres the setting...<br />
<br />
our friendly psychic has drawn 3rd watch at our roadside campsite. sleeping soundly nearby is a level 18ish half-dwarf warrior, 16 moon elf ranger (deposed king of the Elven nation at that. lol), a deadly 20 human rogue, and a level 20 human mage, already on his way to demi-god power.<br />
<br />
the mage played his character super-paranoid, and each night before sleep he would set up an Improved Alarm spell around the perimeter of that camp. All of the players, however, knew the verbal command to disable it so the mage wouldnt be woken everytime someone went to take a leak.<br />
<br />
4am... abandoned trading highway... here is what transpired:<br />
<br />
me: about an hour into your watch, you begin to hear what you figure are soft footsteps moving along the highway toward you.<br />
<br />
psion: hmm... ok. i pretend to be asleep, and watch the road closely<br />
<br />
me: a few minutes pass and around the bend in the road, you see a very feminine shape strolling down the road.<br />
<br />
psion: by herself? i grab a torch from the fire and hold it up to get a better look, and to not scare her.<br />
<br />
me: shes a very beautiful, sinewy blonde of about 20. shes completely naked, and when your torchlight first hits her, her eyes flash silver in the darkness.<br />
<br />
psion: holy @#%$! shes naked? i ask her if she wants to come into the camp and sit by the fire (he says with a canary-eating grin)<br />
<br />
the rest of the party tries to point out to him the stupidity of this, but he is convinced theyre just trying to prevent his character from getting laid. <br />
<br />
mage: at least when he invites her over she will trip my alarm spell<br />
<br />
psion: oh yeah! i disable the alarm so it doesnt wake anyone up.<br />
......<br />
Party wakes up the next morning... no Psion. the ranger tracks his way to a bloody wheat field (ala The Ghost and The Darkness) full of bones, and then to a nearby cave with containing a pack of Jackalweres. <br />
<br />
To this day, everytime he plays under me i always mention theres a naked woman walking down the street when he is on watch. Not once since then has he let her back into the camp</div></div><hr />

A dwarf ranger gets ahold of some narcotics that increas con.<br />
But when they wear off, he took a hit to con. <br />
Add that with the poison from a snake (10 damage to con) and he pretty much died.<br />
<br />
Think we lost two more characters as well.<br />
<br />
Almost as good as the game that ran 3 weeks before everyone died.<br />
<br />
and what's really sad, is that I was gonna milk the poor addicted dwarf for all of the gold he was worth, cause me and a halfling friend bought out the guy that sold it (that he knew of anyway)<br />

<br />
Get there, and set up to play this very moderately stats grey knight (player made class, kinda like a paladin of neutral alignment that uses negative energy..or in other words, lawful neutral, none evil/non good shadow knight kinda character) ..  He's not very butch via class abilities nor stats..   <br />
<br />
Anyways..  The party starts off on a ship, without knowing each other (you can see the inevitable ship wreck scene coming a mile away) ...so one of the group, (evil ranger, I didnt know till later) hooks up with the half orc barbarian chick and decide there going to stoe away food, provisions on this life/boat dingie, and basically kill anyone who tries to share in the safety when the the ship gets attacked via magical storms and monsters.  <br />
aaannnyyyway.. So during the ensuing ship fight, I get wounded to 2 hit points before being forced to flee the ship..  During the process I assist the ranger in getting the boat safely off the ship and into the water, assuming that likewise, he'd assist our cleric and myself in living etc. haha...big mistake.<br />
He decided to attack me as I try to climb into the ship..the DM, already kinda pissed that this guy is (once again, I find out) trying to PK players... hits me for 15 dmg.  After some disparaging looks from the DM, decided that it would 'only' be subdual damage..  LoL.   Yeah, like that matters when your in a raging storm, out at sea right.    SO 'glub glub' I die ...or assume that I do... no big deal, minorly irked at the guy, but he shows me his alignment 'neutral evil' ..so at least I feel he had a reason 'sorta' to be a selfish ****.<br />
Well, the GM, having pity..says that I lived, and wake up on shore...washed up.  Still at 2 hit points however.  My melee weapon is gone, however I still have a pair of throwing weapons strapped on.  Guess who I see coming inland on a capsized dingie.  But the ranger and orc. <br />
Now whats a person to do?  ...pretend it didnt happen?  Let his character live on to bully and find another way to **** people over? I think not.  @#%$ left me for dead, he should have hit me for non subdual..LoL.<br />
So he starts swimming inland..   Soon as he was in range, I throw my weapon and hit him for 7 (now he's at 2 hp)..he rushes me through the surf and misses (there went his chance) ..and I use my one 'nifty' ability for the class...  see PHB cleric domain ability 'death' domain.  hehe..  touch attack, 1d6 per level, if equal to or greater than the targets exsisting hit points, no save death effect.  I roll my hit, I roll 6 points... he looks at the DM all cocky and says... yeah well, I have a really nice fort save and smirks.  DM looks back, and with a straight face, informs him of the lack of fort save.  Poor guy crumpled up his char and stormed off.   <br />
ah well.  On one hand, I felt bad...since I know the DM didnt want it to turn into a PC vs PC game... and honestly, neither did I...but damn did he deserve it. <br />
<br />
Anyway..if the DM had let me die, or the char had hit for non subdual damage, that would have been my shortest character life... however, it ended up being his shortest :-P Edited by: Savia  at: 9/11/03 5:42 pm</div></div><hr />

If it isn't directly trying to kill you, it must indirectly be trying to kill you. That's why I love new players, they are so trusting all guilible.

So into play comes the anthraxian,  a small furry animal that can be a kitten,  puppy.. rabbit.. etc, that has a disease bite and causes nasty damage..  not to mention the killer rabbit.. man I love using those things ^.^<br />

As for the shortest character life i've seen..  A friend of mine was playing a human warrior,  It was a coastal game and we were trying to storm a beach encampment Via water at the moment.  The entire party but the warrior (who hated boats) was still on one of the midsized warships in that was anchored off the coast ~30 yards.  The warrior was on the beach charging the defenses with the rest of our men leading them on a charge like a proper warrior should.  Our mage however was playing with the ships catapult.  He loaded it with baskets of arrows, lit the heads on fire and proceded to launch them towards the shore in an attempt to rain death on our dug in enemies.  So,  our GM has him roll an INT check to see if he gets the angle right.  Of course, fate being what she is decides that this will be the one time that he will miss his check,  he rolls a 20 and rains ~400 flaming arrows onto the beach killing our raiding force and our warrior in one horrable shot.  We of course then loaded the mage into the catapult,  added him to the mass of bodies and sailed south to find another merc army that we could hire. NIL MORTIFI SINE LUCRE <br />

<br />
I love that game.<br />
<br />
Will never forget the time we started every character off with a rainbow pin as part of thier uniform.  <br />
<br />
... yea.<br />
<br />
As far as other games go however, I learned very well that bardic knowledge can be a bad thing if you are playing a character with no self control.<br />
<br />
Basically we were a party of elves, and we started the game as prisoners of the Drow. I was the smart assed bard, and I made my bardic knowledge check as the high priestess of Loth stepped into the doorway. I bow deeply to the lady, and in my most regal of voices intone, &quot;My grand lady... the mistress Auran she favors you above ALL others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, ok... so this cant really count here. The character didnt die. According to the GM, the floor erupted as a portal opened and a legion of spider fiends dragged my body to the demonweb pits to be tortured at the foot of Loths throne for the remainder of reality...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Phresh Prince</div><div class="date">11-09-03, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were playing a higher level game - ~10th level characters.  I spent 5-6 hours making my character (human fighter) and as soon as I joined up with the party, who was looking for a band of hobgoblins, a beautiful girl came out of the woods and offered to show us where the hobgoblin camp was.  She said, however, that she would only bring one of us.  Since I was the new character - I wanted to sort of prove myself and be helpful - so I volunteered to go with her.  Mind you - this has all taken only about 40 sec. of game time.  As soon as I walked into the forest with her - the DM told me to make a saving throw vs. spell (this was 2nd ed.), which I promptly failed with a 4.  <br />
The DM then told me to make a new character unless the party wanted to wait 4-6 years for the charm to wear off (turns out she was a dryad and turned me into her sex slave).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Teannin Bramblefeet</div><div class="date">11-20-03, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following situation happened on Tuesday... as a little background, I am currently playing on a somewhat haphazardly thrown together campaign at a local community college (which I don't attend, but two of my friends do... so that's why I go, dammit!    ). Anyway, said campaign has maybe 20 people who play in it... and about 3 of which are reliable enough to actually show up every day that the DM is running it, so even a very a well put together campaign can suffer severely...<br />
<br />
Anyway, the session is winding down, and so far only one death has taken place: That of a 7th level bard essentially pouting and sitting down when a balor told him to begone, after graciously not killing him... long story that isn't too good. That was all about to change. Said balor was in the lowest sections of a dwarven town's mines, not really doing much but halting any further mining and killing stupid bards. Two other evil characters had gone down with a bard, as well as the party's lawful good druid to offer as a sacrifice. Druid turned into a snake, and escaped, and eventually rejoined the party proper, now consisting of myself, an 8th level thief and a 7th level dwarf fighter. A day passes by in game, and the evil division of the party has not come back up, and are currently trapped behind a door with protection from evil cast on it. Of course, the party doesn't know this, and so we get a large glass vial of... essentially nitro. Head down to the mines, druid opens door as thief throws bottle of nitro in... unbeknownst to the characters, but knownst to the players, this kills the two evil party members in the process.<br />
<br />
It gets better, I promise (Or maybe I'm just really not a good storyteller...). Somebody who had just rolled up a character at the start of the session but had to go to class just arrived, and said character was a half-orc with enormous strength. Apparently our explosives were not enough to collapse the mines onto the demons below, so we went for bigger stuff, 'cause we KNEW that we couldn't kill a balor, but the party just had to latch onto that story hook simply because it was there. So of course, we begin elaborate plotting to bring the mines down, and pray that the protection from evil door wasn't doing anything to hold back the demons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cast web on the wall, stick about fifty bottles of the nitro to it and run like hell, and wait for the spell to wear off!&quot;<br />
&quot;No no no, we don't have anybody with that spell... okay, let's have the half-orc go down there, adhere the bottles to the wall, and have him start smacking at it with his giant fuggin' bracer of thwackiness&quot; (My name for it... big ass bracer utilized for crushing... 2d20 points of damage. Yes, I believe that it's horribly overpowered too!)<br />
&quot;No no no, that'd never work... I say we have the thief drop about fifty bottles of the nitro down a long drop&quot;<br />
&quot;No no no, that'd never work... I'm not dumb enough to do that. How about we get a big fuggin'... we'll call it a vat of the stuff, and have the half-orc smack it with his bracer while we rest safely in the city-proper... don't worry, you have enough HP to soak it up man! (Successful PC to PC bluff check, yes!)&quot;<br />
<br />
So we head down, rather, I should say that the half-orc, the dwarf, and the druid head down with the gigantic vat of nitro, don't ask how it got down there, just be thankful it did (I was). Oh gee, it seems the last blast left a lot of rubble, we can't get the vat into the appropriate position... dwarf starts clearing a path. Druid essentially says &quot;Screw that,&quot; takes a scrap of cloth, soaks it in the nitro, and ignites it. Now, the first blast turned the evil characters into splatters on the wall. The resulting blast from the ignited nitro vaporized the splatters, turned the walls they were on into microscopic dust particles, splattered the dwarf and the druid onto the dust particles, and then removed those particles from the prime material plane. The orc was at 11 HP. A big fuggin' rock then fell, and crushed said orc. The balor is a bit pissed that he can't get any rest with all this racket going on. The thief is resting comfortably just outside of town, and hoping the dwarves don't recognize him as the plan-maker. The orc was played for a total of 12 minutes in the entire campaign. The equipment for said orc took 2 hours of...essentially begging the GM to obtain. <br />

Best way to do that - slit the throat of his Drow while he's in meditation.....before the DM even put the character on paper.<br />
Not a good session for me after that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3.5 DnD campaign. I normally run, but I took an off weekend to play in someone elses game. <br />
<br />
I rolled up a ranger and was told that I had been sent my the mayor of a city to find a group of adventurers he had hired and deliver them a message about how his plan had changed.<br />
<br />
Well, Im a ranger, so I am tracking them on foot, at night, through a thick fog.<br />
<br />
I see a campfire, and I move silently forward because Im not sure its them. I botched my move silently roll.  <br />
<br />
They all made listen checks (the DM had me in another room since they did not know it was me, I did not know it was them.<br />
<br />
DM (to the wizard): You hear a twig snap about 50 feet away.<br />
<br />
Wizard: I look that way. &amp;lt;makes spot check&gt;<br />
<br />
DM: You see a shadow kneeling low to the ground.<br />
<br />
Wizard: I drop a fireball on it.<br />
<br />
DM: What?<br />
<br />
Wizard: I drop a fireball on it. &amp;lt;rolls&gt; 31 damage.<br />
<br />
DM: Umm.... initiative then...<br />
<br />
With a wizard, a cleric, and a barbarian hitting me I died in 3 rounds. I did end up killing the wizard too though.</div></div><hr />
