<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mdar kelf</div><div class="date">08-18-03, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, i'm starting a Gnomish bard (3.5 edition) and need some songs cause the DMs will most likely ask what I'm singing about for RP reasons. Now, I can make up what the song is about on the fly, but it would be nice to have some songs to sing.<br />
<br />
Preferibly some drinking songs (like the drunkin' sailor one   )<br />
and a few other types.<br />
<br />
I plan on going through some irish drinking songs and turning them into 'lantanese' drinking songs, too  <br />
<br />
Any and all help is apreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">08-18-03, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was playing my bard until recently (RIP...) I would just make up titles of what I was singing about on the fly when the GM asked.  Typically, subtly sarcastic songs about the great and wonderfly conceited knight in our group.  <br />
<br />
A pair of examples:<br />
The Ogre and the Mage (to the tune of &quot;The Farmer in the dell&quot;) - a wonderful song about the mage who thought he was smarter than the ogre.<br />
<br />
Thain the Flying Knight - a song about Thain the Magnificent's head to toe battle with a giant...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mdar kelf</div><div class="date">08-18-03, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can do that with out a problem, I am just wanting something I can bust out for roleplay. Would be interesting to get the entire group to break out into a drinking song while we are all at a tavern.<br />
<br />
I can make up lyrics too if I tried, just that, when ever i write a song, the lyrics tend to be on the dark side....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vorashus</div><div class="date">08-20-03, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">within my own tabletop world, my players have come up with a song called &quot;Barmaid Sally&quot;....<br />
<br />
No lyrics have never been set to it, but whenever a raunchy drinking song is called for, one of them always says &quot;i sing 'Barmaid Sally&quot;. <br />
<br />
Was inspired by a promiscuous barmaid from one of our very first adventures as a group many years ago. <br />
<br />
If any of you are actually thinking about writing up a song for this.... if you could put some words to &quot;Barmaid Sally&quot;, i would eternally think you are the coolest person ever</div></div><hr />

GNOMISH SPACE MARINES<br />
(with apologies to the beatles, favors Spelljammer)<br />
<br />
In the sphere where I was born,<br />
Lived the oldest gnome I've seen,<br />
And he told us of his life<br />
In the gnomish space marines<br />
So we 'jammed up to the sun<br />
In our fine well-built machine,<br />
And we joined the stately ranks<br />
Of the Gnomish Space Marines.<br />
<br />
[chorus]<br />
We're all part of the Gnomish Space Marines,<br />
The Gnomish Space Marines, the Gnomish Space Marines.<br />
Yes, we're all part of the Gnomish Space Marines,<br />
The Gnomish Space Marines, the Gnomish Space Marines.<br />
<br />
Got our tinkers all aboard,<br />
All the ones we could afford.<br />
Our kazoo band likes to play...<br />
[musical interlude]<br />
<br />
[repeat chorus]<br />
<br />
Giant hamsters move the wheels,<br />
And they drive our great machine.<br />
They give us spaham for our meals,<br />
And bite us only when they're mean.<br />
<br />
[repeat chorus x2, add verses to your whimsy as gnomes are wont to do]<br />
<br />

<br />
Fun, Fun, Fun (till her daddy takes the longsword away)<br />
apologies to the beach boys<br />
<br />
Well, she got her daddy's sword<br />
and she asked if she could give us a hand now.<br />
Seems she forgot all about<br />
the mon'stery like she told her old man now.<br />
Before her daddy could catch her,<br />
She went lookin' for adventure so grand now.<br />
And she'll have fun, fun, fun<br />
till her daddy takes the longsword away.<br />
(fun, fun, fun, till her daddy takes the longsword away!)<br />
<br />
Well, the orcs can't touch her<br />
'Cause she swings that mighty sword like an ace now<br />
(she fights like an ace now, she fights like an ace.)<br />
She makes a squadron of ogres<br />
flee home with the look of her face now.<br />
(A look on her face now, a look on her face.)<br />
A lot of trools try to catch her,<br />
But she vanishes with nary a trace now.<br />
And she'll have fun, fun, fun<br />
till her daddy takes the longsword away.<br />
(fun, fun, fun, till her daddy takes the longsword away!)<br />
<br />
Wa-ooo, wa-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo-oo<br />
(she fights like an ace now, she fights like an ace.)<br />
Wa-ooo, wa-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo-oo<br />
(A look on her face now, a look on her face.)<br />
And she'll have fun, fun, fun<br />
till her daddy takes the longsword away.<br />
<br />
Now, we knew all along<br />
that her scheme was just too good to be true now.<br />
(too good to be true now, too good to be true.)<br />
And since he took the sword away,<br />
she's been feelin' bored and terribly blue now.<br />
(terribly blue now, terribly blue.)<br />
But she can come along with me<br />
'cause I got another sword +2 now,<br />
And we'll have fun, fun, fun<br />
now that daddy took her longsword away!<br />
(fun, fun, fun, till her daddy takes the long sword away)<br />
<br />
[slow fade]<br />

Brown-Eyed Ghoul<br />
(with apologies to Van Morrison)<br />
<br />
Hey, where did we go<br />
Our last AD&amp;amp;D game?<br />
Our DM-- a real pro--<br />
I give him the full blame.<br />
We were hackin' and a-slashin', hey hey,<br />
Leapin' and a-boundin'<br />
In the misty graveyard dusk<br />
With our pulses poundin'.<br />
Saw you-- my brown-eyed ghoul.<br />
You're my brown-eyed ghoul.<br />
<br />
Moment I saw you<br />
(Your fangs had that dull glow),<br />
I knew that you had me<br />
Paralyzed, sweet and slow.<br />
Lurking in the moonlight, cacklin',<br />
Rising from behind a grave.<br />
Drippin' and a-droolin',<br />
You tell me it's me you crave<br />
Oh you, my brown-eyed ghoul.<br />
You're my brown-eyed ghoul.<br />
<br />
As you dismember me,<br />
I hear you sing:<br />
[gross phlegmmy sounds]<br />
Nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya di-dah<br />
Pgne pgne pgne pgne pgne pgne pgne pgne pgne pgne pgne di-dah<br />
La ti da<br />
<br />
So the you clawed your way<br />
Right through my heart and bone.<br />
I love your mind, it's in decay,<br />
And my, how you can groan.<br />
<br />
Sure, we got problems now and then<br />
(sometimes I'm overcome by your breath)<br />
<br />
Though you like to munch on carrion,<br />
With my dream-ghoul, love conquers death<br />
Oh, my brown-eyed ghoul.<br />
You're my brown-eyed ghoul.<br />
<br />

<br />
And here's the BIG one.<br />
<br />
Companions' Rhapsody<br />
(apologies to queen, favors Dragonlance)<br />
<br />
Tanis:<br />
Is this my real life?<br />
Is this just fantasy?<br />
Why does evil close in on me?<br />
<br />
Raistlin:<br />
Hourglass eyes<br />
Look up to the skies and see.<br />
I'm not a weak mage,<br />
I know the truth, you see.<br />
There will be Dragons Blue, Dragons White,<br />
Dragons Good rise to fight.<br />
Any way the War goes<br />
Doesn't really matter to me-- to me.<br />
<br />
Tas:<br />
Tanis, just look at me!<br />
Found a purse all full of gold!<br />
Oh, its your? Well, then I'll hold--<br />
Tanis-- please let go of me!<br />
I swear I thought you'd thrown it all away!<br />
<br />
Sturm:<br />
Tanis... hey, let him go.<br />
He didn't mean to take your cash.<br />
We must be off to find the Lance tomorrow.<br />
Caramon, Caramon:<br />
Where is Kitiara?<br />
<br />
Kitiara:<br />
I'm late, to meet my friends.<br />
Sent men to the front line<br />
Greatest power will be mine.<br />
Good-bye, everybody, I've got to go,<br />
Gonna leave you all behind and lead my troops.<br />
Tanis (ooo-ooo), you deserve to die.<br />
Behind my back you've fallen for Laurana...<br />
<br />
Laurana:<br />
I see a little Qualinesti in your soul,<br />
Tanthalas, Tanthalas, can I be your companion?<br />
The memories you're fighting--<br />
That human woman's fright'ning me!<br />
<br />
Tanis: Kitiara (kitiara), Kitiara (kitiara)<br />
Kitiara Uth Matar--<br />
A Dragonlord!<br />
<br />
Flint:I'm just an old dwarf, everybody bugs me.<br />
Chorus:He's just an old dwarf, but he's still family.<br />
He'll give his life so that we can be free.<br />
<br />
Caramon: Easy go, easy come. Everybody thinks I'm dumb.<br />
Chorus: Car-a-mon, we do not think you're dumb.<br />
Caramon: I'm not dumb?<br />
Chorus: Car-a-mon, we do not think you're dumb.<br />
Caramon: I'm not dumb!<br />
Chorus: We do not think you're dumb.<br />
Caramon: I'm not dumb, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum!<br />
<br />
Oh brother Raistlin, Brother Raistlin,<br />
Brother Raistlin, where'd you go?<br />
<br />
Raistlin:<br />
To Takhisis, she's a black robe set aside for me<br />
For me...<br />
For me!<br />
<br />
[musical interlude, headbanging]<br />
<br />
Sturm:<br />
So you think evil dragons can beat the good guys?<br />
So you think you can stab me and leave me to die?<br />
Oh, Lady-- you might do this to me, Lady<br />
But you'll never win out,<br />
You'll never defeat Good and Right!<br />
<br />
Tanis:<br />
Paladine has triumphed<br />
Check the skies and see.<br />
Evil has no place here--<br />
We're free.<br />
<br />
