<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-25-06, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, me and tea have been working on a very potent rogue, and you know what that means!<br />
<br />
1. No more trap dodging<br />
2. No more lute passing up<br />
3. Well, more killing I suppose, ... alot more<br />
4. He can also cast wands pretty damn proficiently<br />
5. And he is close enough to get both int and wis checks with a wand casting.<br />
<br />
Once he gets to three I am going to take him through some high level stuff, to get him close to four if not four. He may not be able to show up saturday though, not sure. Something about working late.<br />
<br />
So yea, that is if we are showing up, I will be. Hopefully rag is feeling better. Hopefully jaes doesn't have to look at pictures of old hairy people all night. :b</div></div><hr />

Local doctor gave me a scrip for Percocet, they help cut the pain a bit but it is still there.  I should make Saturday night, but not the usually until 3 am times.</div></div><hr />

Also... wand casting is not a priority... so the 'proficiently' bit is somewhat... incorrect =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-27-06, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in last nights little, &quot;you have nothing better to do?&quot; group night me and yal, and tea messed around and did a few K quests. We uterly destroyed those, and weren't bothered by a single trap. Also, we got the loot we never could before. Anyhow, depending on how rag is feeling/whether he can stay up moderately late. I don't see there being a problem with the five of us knocking the ever loving crap outa daleras. Or maybe just doing STK on elite, I heard somewhere that STK on elite is worth a lot of experience. *shrug* Anyway, see ya's tonight.</div></div><hr />

Troz had to go, painy pain pain pain. Me and Eve are taking a break and will be back on around 11 - 11.5 to hopefully play a bit with our hard working rogue and sorceror. So yea.</div></div><hr />
