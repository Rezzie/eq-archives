<br />
Two of my friends and I were thinkin about giving d&amp;amp;d a try but dont wanna waste all the money on the books and then find out we hate it (well I know i'll love it but dunno about them) and I saw your (Elerion) post on the safehouse about how you have a .pdf of the rulebook and would be willing to share for beginners.  I was just hoping you would share it <br />
with me, and perhaps help me a tad if I have any questions.<br />
<br />
THANKS ALL!<br />
<br />
P.S. My email is 'bugoo@cvzoom.net' and I attempted to email you Elerion asking you for it but the email I sent to the adress you posted did not go threw, well thanks to anyone who can help!</div></div><hr />
