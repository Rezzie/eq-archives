Below is a pic of the Ichigo and Rukia series 1 twin pack, usually selling for about $15.  They're 5&quot; tall (well, Ichigo is right at 5&quot; with the tips of his spiked hair, while Rukia comes in at about 4 1/2&quot;). They look nice and have some good detail; about the only thing I would've liked different is to have Ichigo with his other zanpakuto.<br />
<br />
I figured while I was at it I may as well take a pic of the Dragonball Z figurines I bought a little while ago.  I like Android 16's pose.</div></div><hr />

 I actually wouldn't mind having something like that, but alas it's probably hand made and main stream plastic ones are crap IMO not worth touching. From seeing quite a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-13-07, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol. Yeah as people say, I am a huge figure collector. I don't like the smaller scale stuff much (Anything below 6&quot;, really.) But I, of course, pay a preminum for it. I generally stick with certain companies, I don't buy anything completely mass produced. By mass produced, I mean stuff made in almost limitless quantity for the casual fans. Most of the bigger figure companies make in somewhat limited quantity so most stuff get sold out within a few weeks.<br />
<br />
For shounen stuff, Megahouse has never failed me with their excellent stuff. I have the entire Portrait of Pirates line (Yes, all 12 of them!) which are as the name implies, One Piece figures. The quality and workmanship on it are extraordinary. You don't see that kind of quality on Shounen figures usually. They are 1/8 scale, and so are about 9&quot; tall.<br />
<br />
They also make a Bleach line, which has Rukia and Ichigo on first release, Inoue and Renji on second release. I did not pick them up though, I'm not as big of a fan of Bleach as I am of One Piece, and I'm not attached to any of the characters of Naruto or Bleach, where in One Piece I'm attached to the entire crew.<br />
<br />
For everything else, I stick with Good Smile Company, Alter, and Max Factory. With Max Factory being the best, the other two you can't go wrong with. I sometimes get figures from other companies, but not without careful consideration and checking their reputation. I know some small but high quality companies that rarely release stuff as well.<br />
<br />
But I'm anal about my figures. Any discoloration, excess material, lines, notches, etc get a heavy scowl from me. Lately I've been spending my money more on resin figures, as I have someone building them and painting them for me now for a small fee. And free if I buy one that he's going to make for himself too.<br />
<br />
whee for both BUBBA yuki's for cost :)<br />
<br />
@ shebab - wait until you see the gigantic post I'm going to be making sometime this week. You'll **** bricks, I kid you not. It's a WonderFest 2007 list of stuff I like and want :D That's the reason I haven't updated in a while (that, and I've been hiking and snowboarding). And I'm also working on the Spring anime list at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-13-07, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually wouldn't mind having something like that, but alas it's probably hand made and main stream plastic ones are crap IMO not worth touching.

<br />
Actually, that's a mass producted figure by Clayz. You can certainly get your hands on them, and they are not mainstream in the same sense most shounen ones you see are.<br />
<br />
Clayz are a very good company, although they burned me a bit when they released their Maid Saber colored the more standard black instead of the blue they were showing in their promo pictures.<br />
<br />
However, that aside, they are excellent figure makers. I'm extremely anal and expect only the best when I pay $50-100 for each figure I buy. I highly recommend going ahead and getting it. As long as you avoid certain mainstream companies and stick with the companies I listed above, you'll almost never go wrong.<br />
<br />
EDIT: By the way, that picture is not the resin version that was shown at WonderFest 2006. That picture is of the actual figure they are mass producing, so what you see is what you get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mingo</div><div class="date">03-13-07, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, that Rin is from Good Smile.  As far as I know Clayz has no plans for a Rin maid, which sucks because the clayz Saber and good smile Rin are different scale, but oh well.  <br />
<br />
I just started getting into figures in the past few months and have already spent entirely too much on them.  I think I have 12 figures on preorder between now and July :(  <br />
<br />
On the bright side, I did manage to snag both an ebcraft Rin (http://www.hlj.com/product/ENT01349) and Archer (http://www.hlj.com/product/ENT01348) in the last month when hobbysearch found some stock hidden in some corner somewhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya it is hehe. And ya the really good figures (and even just 1/2 way decent ones) are expensive as crap hehe....you could spend close to $200 on just 3 figures alone...</div></div><hr />

Whoops, you're right. I was getting all the maids switched around. I bought the Clayz Saber Maid outfit, not the Good Smile one. I thought the pose on Good Smile's Saber Maid was bad, however I like the Rin one a lot.<br />
<br />
I also got that Archer and Rin as well. This pic is somewhat outdated (does not include my Saber Maid and Ilya Swimsuit figures, as well as Enter Brain's Archer and Rin, and the Scarlet Ruby Rin.)<br />

<br />
That's Alter for you, they are incredible. I'm slightly less than impressed with the Clayz Rin and Saber (the ones to the right and left of the swimsuit ones) due to some discoloration but it's hard to see unless you look hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mingo</div><div class="date">03-13-07, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I didn't care for the Good Smile Saber that much either, I also went with the Clayz one.  And I would kill for that Good Smile Rider, but not for the $200 its going for on ebay.<br />
<br />
And seeing as how you are such a Fate fan, you might want to check out the series 1 trading figures from Good Smile and the Fate/Hollow Ataraxia ones from Alter.  I have both full sets and both are very nice.  The Alter one in particular is very good quality (Dark Saber FTW).<br />
<br />
PS. I know there are some big Manabi fans around here, this (http://www.hlj.com/product/GSC96264) figure is amazing looking.</div></div><hr />

I know they are well done, but they clutter spaces a lot and don't really catch my eye. That's why I stopped collecting them.<br />
<br />
Also, I've vowed to not buy any more Fate/Stay Night figures. The only reason I got Enter Brain's Tohsaka Rin and Archer is because There is a HUGE lack of Archer figures. And I wanted Tohsaka to compliment him.<br />
<br />
I originally didn't plan on getting the Clayz Saber - I did like it, but this goes back to my vow of not getting any more Fate/Stay Night figures. I have too many already, as much as I loved the game. But Rightstuf shipped it 3 months earlier than I expected, whoops.<br />
<br />
Also, with Haruhi figures starting to come out in full scale, I can't spare any expense. Next time I borrow my friend's camera, I'll take some updated pictures. And I think Sollon wants to see my Tsukihime figure collection, anyway.<br />
<br />
I have that Manabi figure on preorder, as well as this. (http://www.hlj.com/product/SIT13084) I'm trying to deciede whether to get that blue version or the white (http://www.hlj.com/product/SIT13085) version.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I've gotten death threats for that Rider figure. You won't be the first. Haha.</div></div><hr />

You know it! B/c your damned if you could find em now or even if you do for less then a small $500ish. <br />

Man if only i knew of the Tsukihime figures sooner! :D.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">03-13-07, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol. Yeah as people say, I am a huge figure collector.

<br />
I can appreciate the detail that goes into the more expensive figurines, but I like the decent quality mass market figurines because they're cheaper and easier to get.  Plus while looks are great, I like it when the creator of any figurine gets the pose correct regardless of the underlying quality.  The pose is part of the trigger in my mind which gets me thinking of the characters in motion.<br />
<br />
Using the figurines in my first post as examples, Ichigo is a classic &quot;draw sword first, think later&quot; type pose, while Rukia is more guarded but ready to go.  Goku's doing his classic Kamehameha attack, while I can almost hear Android 16's battle yell.  Part of the reason I got the Dragonball Z figures was because they offered a decent amount of detail in a small size.  My Goku, Android 16, Cell Jr., Ichigo, and Rukia figures cost less than $25 total, so they're not a money sink either.<br />
<br />
I use figurines to supplement my anime viewing, so if I was to spend $50 on an anime character, instead of spending the whole budget on a figurine I'd get a couple DVDs or a less expensive figurine and a DVD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-13-07, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You all say that, but you just want to see what it looks like on the back. Haha.<br />

Well fine then, I'll do it. I'll see if I can't get the camera by thursday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, many times with the more expensive figures, the downside is being stuck with certain poses. The mass produced stuff has more variety, usually. Though, I believe Megahouse did well in getting the two in balance.<br />
<br />
I don't really like the Bleach line, Ichigo's spiky hair has a lot to do with it. Spiky hair doesn't transition well to figures, neither does bright orange hair. But for the sake of comparision, here is the Megahouse figure they did.  (click thumbnail for full size)<br />
<br />
1317<br />
<br />
(You can see Inoue in the background. That figure is also Megahouse, and is as horrible as it looks. For some reason, the Bleach Megahouse line is nowhere near as good as the One Piece Portrait of Pirates line. Too bad.<br />
<br />
1318<br />
<br />
This is the Luffy one, much better in fine detail than the other two. It might be hard to tell, but it is extremely faithful to the anime designs. You can see the toning of the body, his frame, the detail in his shirt and hands, and the like. Very very good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">03-14-07, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">White uniform, it just looks more natural to have those white as well.<br />
 <br />
Blue would work on a darker, winter uniform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-14-07, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm split on both. For one, the blue one is more faithful to the standard school swimsuit. I don't always go for what's true to the original, or what's the standard, but it's something to consider. A school swimsuit under the uniform is moe~.<br />
<br />
However, the uniqueness of the white color as well as the more &quot;clean&quot; look is good too. But it looks too much like panties, which is not really a bad thing, but that somewhat defeats the whole purpose of a swimsuit under the uniform look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">03-14-07, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that pic aint the best, but from the looks of Mika, it doesn't go all the way up like a swimsuit would. Granted, maybe it does, which would really make it look like an actual swimsuit, but the angle on the pic suggests otherwise.<br />
 <br />
If it does, in fact, go up passed her shirt, then blue would be OK. (and a bit unique, befitting the characters)<br />
 <br />
If it really is only panties, then it's gotta be white.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-15-07, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are definitely swimsuits. On both blue and white versions. All the sites say their names, navy/white, school swimsuits. I agree that white panties would fit them better, but that's not the case this time.<br />
<br />
Feh, I have a lot of time to deciede. Or maybe I'll get both, and mix them up for a blue AND white version?! Genius, however, my wallet denied me. Too bad!</div></div><hr />
