<br />
Innovative Agreement Will Provide Episodes On A Download To Own/Rent Basis Soon After They Air In Japan<br />
<br />
San Francisco, CA, January 10, 2007 – VIZ Media, LLC (VIZ Media), one of the entertainment industry's most innovative and comprehensive publishing, animation and licensing companies, has announced that it has licensed from Nippon Television Network Corporation (NTV) the Download to Own (DTO) and Download to Rent (DTR) rights for the United States for the smash hit DEATH NOTE anime series, currently airing in Japan.<br />

DEATH NOTE, based on the Shueisha manga series of the same name, is currently one of the hottest anime titles in Japan. Published in North America by VIZ Media, it depicts the adventures of Light Yagami, an ace student with great prospects but who is bored out of his mind. All of that changes when he finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by a rogue Shinigami death god. Any human whose name is written in the notebook dies, and now Light has vowed to use the power of the Death Note to rid the world of evil. But when criminals begin dropping dead, the authorities send the legendary detective L to investigate, and he is soon hot on the trail of Light, who must now reevaluate his one noble goal.<br />
<br />
“We are pleased to team with a leading anime and manga company like VIZ Media to bring the DEATH NOTE anime series to eager fans in the United States digitally,” states NTV Spokesperson. “VIZ Media understands how the Internet can be used to distribute content.

Well, it's interesting news. Not so much that DN was licensed, that was to be expected, however what was interesting was the fact that they plan to provide an episode by episode download of the series similar to that of fansubs. Wonder what would come from this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">01-10-07, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main problem comes from the subtitles they will use. If the translation/typesetting/ect. suck many people will begin looking for the superior fansubbed versions.<br />
 <br />
And it doubly sucks that the group I was following isn't going to sub it anymore :(  Now I'm faced with pay-for episodes which, if it's like any other anime ever liscenced, will have mediocre typesetting/translation. Add to the fact it will be available for download 'soon after release' and I can see a massive rush-job leading to an even more inferior end product.</div></div><hr />

Add to the fact it will be available for download 'soon after release' and I can see a massive rush-job leading to an even more inferior end product.<br />
<br />
Most of the typesetting problems can be attributed to the limitations of DVD.  It's the one thing I miss about anime on VHS, the nice subtitles.  I imagine if they are going to offer episode downloads then the subs will be far superior to DVD ones, type-set wise. <br />
<br />
Translation issues are another matter entirely.  I'm not familiar enough with what Viz has done as of late to really say one way or the other.  I know they aren't usually big on retaining honorifics, but can't honestly recall if they have issues with dubtitling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-10-07, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt Viz will bother to do good typesetting. For one thing, it's extra work - it can't be transitioned over to DVD. I don't think they care about competiting with fansubbers, they know people will buy no matter what.<br />
<br />
However, I can't really justify investing in an episode by episode basis of this. The most I'd ever bother to pay for this is cost of the cheapest cable station in japan divided by the number of other shows on the package, basically.<br />
<br />
That's like, less than one cent. Don't get me wrong, it's not a very technical morality stance, and I'm not saying it's right/wrong/whatever. Death Note is an excellent anime, I've always compared watching fansubs to watching things on TV. And buying the DVD if I like it. It's not entirely the same as many anime are on pay per view channels, they have to watch commercials, they pay for the cable, and so on.<br />
<br />
So it's a half assed justification. My point being, assuming Death Note is 39 episodes, I really wouldn't pay more than 5 dollars to download the whole three cours and watch it. If it was free, and had commercials in it, I'd be happy to watch it.<br />
<br />
If it was good, I'll buy the DVD's. I do the same with TV shows, when I watch TV, all I'm paying is for the 10 dollars a month to sample hundreds of shows, and buy the ones I like.<br />
<br />
But who knows, it's early in the game, I'll wait and see how it pans out.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Most likely, no.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">01-13-07, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting article on Death Note DVD (http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/9891.html)<br />
<br />
The Death Note DVDs, which have not yet been scheduled, will be the English dubbed version; the download will be the subtitled version. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Asked why the downloads were being released first, the spokesperson provided this statement: <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;In the case of Death Note, we recognize that there is an opportunity to satisfy the fan demand to be able to see their favorite properties faster than a traditional home video release model.  We look at Download to Own as a means to satisfy fans who are at the forefront of these properties released in Japan and want to see the properties in the U.S. closer to Japan's release, and also as a means to broaden that audience by allowing viewers to try a single episode of a property before they purchase the physical product.  We do not see these two distribution areas as mutually exclusive and believe that fans who want to catch the official version via download to own (subtitled version) closer to Japan's release date will also collect the home video (dubbed version) to have the physical  product for their shelves and their collections.&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounds like the DVD version is going to be dubbed only.  They believe many will get the DL version and the DVD version to own the physical product.  This is all very odd sounding.  Only the dub on the DVD?   Surely not.  Expect that fans will buy both?  The DL version better be damn cheap if they truly expect that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-13-07, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt it'll be dubbed only, that's taking five step backwards to the VHS days. If it actually turns out to be dubbed only, I'll be furious as I would not be able to watch it on DVD at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-15-07, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt it'll be dubbed only, that's taking five step backwards to the VHS days. Or a step sideways into 4Kids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said, surely not.  <br />
<br />
It's just the way it was said that makes it sound that way.  But it wouldn't be the first time there's been a dubbed-only dvd release, though granted they are rare, and have almost always occured under special circumstances.</div></div><hr />
