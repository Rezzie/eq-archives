<br />
I am starting to actively recruit for our guild. As of Phase 1 of my recruiting process I am currently seeking hardcore crafters to fill our ranks. I'm not going to pretend I know alot about crafting because I don't (personally, I'm an adventurer)... However, I do recognize the importance that crafters bring to a guild sometimes that's even more important then what the adventurers bring at times. Eventually we will have a crafting manager or maybe 2 depending on how many crafters I can get.. My ideal goal is to have total about 120 members.. with around 40-50 Hardcore crafters split in half in EST and PST. However I won't limit it to just these time zones if you can play during these times. I expect all of our adventurers to supply you with items that you would need.. example if collecting resources works in anyway that it does in eq2 I expect all of our adventurers to be able to harvest these and supply them to the crafters... In addition to working with the other crafters of the guild as a team, I expect the adventurer's to support you as well and vice versa.. I really do want people who are focused on just crafting, and have a love for it as well. If everything goes according to my plan the crafters would be their own separate entity almost as if the guild consisted of nothing but crafters with an almost endless supply of resources, also I want to keep any wealth/capital within the guild, we will set the standards and we will be a fully self sufficient guild relying on only ourselves, Then I want to flood the market with our items to where everyone else is relying on us as well. We will be the richest guild/players to exist on our server if not worldwide. <br />
<br />
This is just the first phase of my recruiting strategy so I invite you to come to our website and read up on us and if you like apply and hopefully Valiance will be your new home. <br />

If you like what you see visit our forums and apply for membership, remember to read the APPLICANTS: READ FIRST section, this will also give you some background as to who I am, and since EQ2 players is around you can also see that I mean business. <br />

But you'll have to go there to read about it. <br />
<br />
The guild I assisted in recruiting for at 1 time was the wealthiest on their server and still 1 year later after I've left that game due to boredom is ranked 3 for wealthiest guild on the server. <br />
<br />
Thankyou for your time.<br />
<br />
While currently my focus is on setting up a strong base of crafters, I am not overlooking any adventurer's apps, but being the rogue that I am my attention span isn't broad enough :P  Besides it gives me an excuse to bump this thread later :)<br />
<br />
Anyway check us out if you like.  If you have any questions about my plans feel free to msg me on our forums or here.</div></div><hr />
