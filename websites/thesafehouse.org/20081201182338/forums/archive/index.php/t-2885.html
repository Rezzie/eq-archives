<br />
Personally, I am reading up on the 3rd Ed rules for D&amp;amp;D at the moment.  I don't have a gaming group, but still like to put together scenarios, NPC's and other bits and pieces.  Once I get some stuff sorted out here, I will post some of them for others to use if they want.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, I have played ShadowRun and Vampire the Masquerade many years ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
our DM had it out for us though  <br />
<br />
He ruled that while in Werewolf form we couldn't carry machine guns because of the finger guard thingies (our fingers wouldn't fit) so we had to cut them off and he gave us a chance to drop our gun everytime we fired after that.<br />

oh, and omg Sinibar (?sp?) one of the strangest systems I have ever played... character creation took forever, but my character could actually probably live through 1,000,000 points of damage!  If you have seen or played it you know what I am talking about.  Bizzare. <br />

<br />
I know a lot of folks don't like 3rd edition.  The best reason I've heard for that yet is that it no longer feels like 1st or 2nd edition AD&amp;D and that it is a totally new system.  While I agree it feels different, I vastly prefer it over 2nd edition.<br />

To each his own, I suppose.  A good GM can make anything fun...</div></div><hr />

GM:  Ok, What is your Armor Value?<br />
Player: I'm wearing enchanted Plate, so the threshold is 18.<br />
GM:  (rolls Dice and consults NPC sheet)  Looks like he hits again.  You should have Dodged or Parried.<br />
Player:  Argh!  How can he keep hitting me?!  I have the best armor in the game!<br />
GM:  Well, his level, stats and weapon give him a total of +13 to hit, which means he only needs to roll over a 5 to hit you unless you use one of your actions to Dodge or Parry.<br />
Player:  But if I Dodge or Parry, I give up my attack!<br />
