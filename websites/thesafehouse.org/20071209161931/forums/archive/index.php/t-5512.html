<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Qutsemnie</div><div class="date">02-24-04, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(edit: changed the title for people.  Feel free to move to rant hall if you want I wont be offended.  I should have put it there to start)<br />
I dont know whether to giggle or rant.<br />
<br />
First 2 links for your info.<br />
<br />
mboards.eqtraders.com/upl...adid=13838<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
www.eqtraders.com/recipes...0010100000<br />
<br />
<br />
Now. note that they gave shamans a line of inexpensive potions that let you throw snare/stun attacks.  <br />
<br />
First why would I giggle?  Come on its snare yo!   Even broke this exciting.  This changes everything.  A rangable snare that a rogue can use?  Thats fabolous and the primary reason that i posted in main lounge.  If this gets fixed its huge to rogues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now though... that said.<br />
Rant part 1.<br />
<br />
Why cant they give rogues a cheap no mob drops snare poison again?  <br />
What was that line of thinking?<br />
What the heck is the difference?  Cause let me tell you something.  If it was a poison it would cost about 3 times as much to make as the shamans have to pay (11pp).  And it would require about 250 poison skill and require mob drops. I mean cause thats just the way rogues get structured.<br />
<br />
But a shaman.. gets snare for everyone.  It cost 11pp and has an 82 trivial and doesnt require any mob drops.  ya....  Its great it really is.  This rants about poison not shamans =)<br />
<br />
Rant part 2.<br />
<br />
Dont these thrown attacks look like something suggest for rogues in fix rogues?<br />
<br />
And with a ninja mindset why cant we make our own stunning powders?  Snaring powders?  They should atleast make these a duel skill thing.  alchemy/poison.<br />
<br />
But.  That said.  I have a 52 shaman.  Its skill is already above some of those trivials.  But tonite im going to get that guy to 180 for 1k.  Ill be ready when they fix these and nerf those cheap trivials =)<br />
<br />
Bring on the snare.<br />
<br />
<br />

That coupled with the fact that intimidate doesnt really work makes me wonder why you think snare for a rogue is such a big thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Qutsemnie</div><div class="date">02-24-04, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets make a list.<br />
-2 raid weapons proc a good snare. no drop.  your lucky if you have them.<br />
-1 group weapon procs a 15 min snare. droppable. uber sick rare.  generally regarded as uncampable.  weak but passable ratio. (WTB ANKLESMASHER pst quellious.  Serious = )<br />
-short sword procs a 1 min dot.  ratio is weak.  cant use escape while proc is active.  on average it will be on when the mob runs. <br />
-dagger procs a 30 second dot.  ratio is pathetic.  cant use escape while proc is active.  proc prolly wont be active unless you mainhand it~<br />
<br />
<br />
-Poison: spine bruiser  1 min snare proc advanced poison. requires a mob drop item for 1 charge.  <br />
-Poison: spine rend 1 min snare proc advanced poison requires a mob drop item for 1 charge.<br />
-Poison: muscle lock line.  requires precharging weapon.  Requires mob drop for 1 charge.  suffers from oldschool poison duration unreliablity (check for resist every tick)<br />
<br />
generic items:<br />
4 shot quest snare item<br />
fungus beast glands<br />
<br />
<br />
All but three of those are procs.   I think people get headaches looking for crystalized sulfur.   But the weapon selection is either sucky or rare.  We cant be expect to call those <br />
&quot;abilities.&quot;  3 of them are really nice if you have them.<br />
<br />
Lets examine the shaman throwable snare to rogue poisons.<br />
<br />
The shaman throwable snare requires vendor components.<br />
The rogue poisons require mob drops.<br />
<br />
The shaman throwable snare has a pre50 trivial.<br />
Only the 1 shot rogue poison has a pre50 trivial.<br />
<br />
The shaman throwable snare can be used at any time.  <br />
The rogue poison has to be loaded onto your weapon in the 1 shot case or it has to be cast then you wait for a proc. <br />
<br />
The shaman throwable snare's intended design is usuable before combat is engaged (via range and not using a proc)<br />
The rogue poison with an unreliable duration that has to be preloaded can be used in melee range only but instantly.  The procing poison requires sustained melee.<br />
<br />
The shaman throwable snare can be loaded into range mid encounter.<br />
The rogue poisons all require pauses to use. <br />
<br />
The shaman throwable snare will be bazaar fodder.<br />
The quest items and fungus beast glands are no drop.<br />
<br />
The shaman throwable snare doesnt require a raid drop.<br />
2 weapons on that list are raid drop. 1 weapon is in chardok libarary and brings new meaning to rare.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there a rogue snare that im missing in this list.  If so please educate me. Otherwise this looks like a change to me.<br />
<br />
I think it would be roughly equal if crystalized sulfur wasnt a mob drop or shaman snares required mob drops.<br />
<br />
The other major change is that shaman snares will be loadable in combat with no delay.  Which ups the utility by alot as it can be hard to predict when you want snare.  Thats only matched by the quest snare and the fungus beast gland.<br />

<br />
It doesn't fit in the ammo slot, only the range slot<br />
<br />
so you have to fux around and swap items around<br />
<br />
<br />
did i mention it wasn't stackable?<br />
<br />
<br />
My shaman carries a few of these around for gigglez, and they're actually fairly reliable, but it's not something i go rummaging around in my packs for if something runs unexpectedly<br />

And to clear things up, Snare is a 3.9 minute duration spell while Ensnare is a 14 minute duration spell.  I think the person above was confusing which spell was on Anklesmasher.  As you can see it's Snare, the 3.9 minute duration spell. Edited by: Chromite at: 2/24/04 1:04 pm</div></div><hr />

Alchemy only goes up to 200.  This means you can expect regular failure rates.  <br />
<br />
A lot of shamans are using this to skill up on right now.  You can go from pretty much nothing to 200 skill in an evening.  Because of this, I would be surprised if the cost factor wasn't nerfed.  Alchemy used to be quite expensive to raise and because of the large number of things to drop, very painful to the hands and patience.  The new tradeskill interface and this dirt cheap recipe makes getting to 200 so easy compared to what it has been in the entire game to date up until right NOW that I wouldn't be terribly stunned if they snuck a nerf in somewhere.<br />
<br />
If you want to grab some potions cheap, I would suggest finding the alchemy vendors on the boat in the Abysmal Sea in GoD.  I'm sure one of them, the female vendor who holds ALL the potion components is stacked thousands deep in these potions after a day or so after a patch.  <br />
<br />
Btw, they cost only about 6pp when you buy them off her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure how rare, found one in bazaar last night for 2k.  I'd never seen one before though.  If I keep it, I'll probably use it for emergency situations like when the snarer of the group goes down and the snare runs out (heh...a snare-kiting rogue, how novel), or to gain agro for a critical reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, this is rather funny, but Shamans can't actually throw these potions as they have 0 throwing skill.  These potions are only usable by other classes, so it doesn't really do anything for them.<br />
<br />
Also, hey should raise the alchemy max to 250.  Make it a free tradeskill to raise to 250 just like Make Poison is for rogues. Edited by: Ravenwinged Angel at: 2/26/04 2:17 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actaully IIRC Forlorn idol drops out in stonebrunt off the shamans, and has 5 charges of stun, but must be equiped.<br />
<br />
I know what you are thinking of though, but didn't know that it was inventory clickable, and clickable by anyone.<br />
<br />
It is just clinging darkness though.. so better used as agro than snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Qutsemnie</div><div class="date">02-26-04, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering you only proc once a minute offhand on average and the darkness on the serrated bone dirk only last 30 seconds I believe you all have severly overestimated its usefulness through the use of rose colored glasses.  Statistically speaking you can bank on something running at full speed if you dont have WA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Theres also a shortsword for about 2k.  Better ratio.  Same proc 1 minute duration.<br />
<br />
Tad better.  Cause most of the time it will be on.  However since the duration and proc rate offhand are approximately the same you can count on some full speed runners.  Its still a gamble.<br />
<br />
In addition proc snares have 0 versatility.  You cant decide to snare.  Shaman items you can decide to snare.  You cant snare without being in the fight  yet.  Shaman items you can snare first.  Useful for breaking a camp.  Which was one of the key things I had in my head.  Rogues only had escape and quest/expensive itemsto get mobs divided .<br />
<br />
If you dont like them you dont like them.  If your not imaginative enough to not think this is a cool new option.  Fine.  But I got 286 days logged in on my rogue dont tell me about the serrated bone dagger please.<br />
<br />
I use to wield one for dps for heavens sake.<br />

Cost me like 4k, which is seriously about 1/10 or somwhat less than what it would have cost pre-GoD.<br />
<br />
They do not stack, but who cares? I gave 12 snare III's to a monkey pal of mine after the combine-fest and now he won't stop asking for more. And as a Barb shaman it's nice to finally have a snare, even though I solo very little nowadays.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way, there will be that many more shaman now who can make gate potions, so they undoubtedly will get much cheaper, for those of you melee who lack other means of gating at least. Baron Dannil Farseer<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ReflanX</div><div class="date">02-27-04, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There will be far, far, far more shamans with high or maxed alchemy skill now, because alchemy has for the most part been useful for only a few potions, many of which sell about as close to cost as you can get, since they offer good skill up routes.  Used to be super expensive too, until titan potions came out a while back, and now the snare potions.  Many if not most shaman didn't bother with alchemy until now.<br />
<br />
You might be able to get some potions a bit cheaper, but gate potions are still very expensive to make, and even one failure to make one can eat the profit from many successful combines.  The market for them, due to their price and to the fact that people can get Overthere hammers and gate necklaces, isn't really all that large, so there isn't a compelling reason to go into making them as it is.  I don't really feel motivated to make any on my shaman, and I wouldn't be surprised if other shamans also aren't too thrilled about doing expensive, risky combines for an item that few but the wealthy buy, and even fewer buy multiples of.<br />
<br />
I'm max tradeskills in everthing but tinkering/research on my shaman(he can't do those), but stuff that doesn't sell well and for good money just isn't very exciting to me.  I can often make more money camping stuff, or just go get some AA or hang around yakking with online friends or something.</div></div><hr />
