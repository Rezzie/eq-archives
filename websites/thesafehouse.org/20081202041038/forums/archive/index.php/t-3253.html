<br />
Has anyone made good use of setting traps in the packaged adventure, or is this skill something that would be more useful in other mods? I've only just finished chapter one, so maybe I'm asking a question that is obviously answered later on. I think the idea is wonderful but can't seem to figure out how to get it to work on npcs.</div></div><hr />

No more monster.  Thats in the &quot;not-so-intelligent&quot; SP game.<br />
<br />
In MP it would be about the same but the PCs get a skillcheck and might &quot;see&quot; the trap and be able to adjust accordingly.<br />
<br />
BUT with a &quot;proper&quot; AI script, even NPCs could be made to react to traps.  Rogue NPCs could be scripted to &quot;see&quot; a trap and perhaps run around it or even disarm it before advancing on you.  The scripting options are pretty endless...<br />
<br />
All NWN needs is a barrage of C+ scriptors!  Now you have a reason to ask your parents for money for college... C+ and module design!  Hehe.<br />

She'd lay out a whole little &quot;path of doom&quot; for them to run across and then nail them with her bow.  Worked really well, since she was taking out monsters that we creaming me (and my character's no sissy)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the tips, I'll keep hanging on to those traps I've found as treasure. Sounds like they're a bit limited in use and that my hide/stealth skills are a bit low right now.</div></div><hr />
