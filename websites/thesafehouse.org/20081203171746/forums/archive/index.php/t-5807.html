I read an interview on Caster's Realm, and the guy said they MIGHT be able to be rogues, it was uncertain at that point. Lol, if they are, they will prolly be the best stat wise and make us all bitter     <br />

EQ rogues where strength is the key factor to damage then they wont be that special.<br />
I could be wrong but I imagine they are gonna have high dex agi but low str sta. high wis but low int.<br />

Yes Verant is far FAR from effective in their application of their sometimes vague or idiotic rules BUT choose your insults with a bit more tact please.</div></div><hr />

Ok ok, I'll be pc and to avoid a flamewar, I'll refer to them as 'name facists' or something...<br />
<br />
I know many many people who had their names changed against their will after sometimes having it for over a year and for very obscure reasons and their was no concern for their feelings.  Some gm's act like you think a N*** would, others might see a name like 'Tiggole Bitties' and would not go out of their way to mess with the person.<br />
<br />
Personally if I'm still playing by then I'll make a kitty beastlord, made a lvl 1 guy 'Tarxan' to save the name though I know it's gonna get nuked     Can't see a better rogue then a gnome heheh... Edited by: belgrathx at: 6/29/01 2:47:04 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
 High Str : They might be small, but they've got fantastic strength for their size.<br />
 High Dex : They're pretty good at hitting whetever they're aiming at...<br />
 Low Agi : ...but they'll turn around and trip over their own feet.<br />
 High Int : My dang cat figured out (when he was still a kitten!) how to pin a can of Pounce down, pull the lid back with his paw enough to grab it with his mouth and open it, and tilt the can to dump all the Pounce out...<br />
 Low Wis...but still hasn't realized that, no, he just CAN'T beat the bigger cat up.<br />
<br />
I'd also give an innate movement speed increase but tweak the code to make them more vulnerable to Fear.<br />
