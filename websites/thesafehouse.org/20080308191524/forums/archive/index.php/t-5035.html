<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bile Silhouette</div><div class="date">04-20-02, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a few messages when I revealed that I ran the soulblade template.  So I thought I would post a bit on my experiences on it to answer peoples questions.<br />
<br />
Level 46 Shadowblade<br />
My template<br />
33 (+12) Stealth<br />
34 (+6) Leftaxe<br />
35 (+9) Axe<br />
39 (+9) Crit Strike<br />
7 (+5) Envenom<br />
<br />
My realm rank is 3 (+2 to all skills)<br />
<br />
Tentitively, My level 50 should look something close to -<br />
37 (+13) Stealth<br />
34 (+6) Leftaxe<br />
43 (+9) Axe<br />
43 (+9) Crit Strike<br />
7 (+5) Envenom<br />
<br />
<br />
What do I get out of this template?? Damage.  Pure steel damage.   I don't have to worry about resists, I don't have to worry about reapplying poisons, I just hit my style buttons and hit hard EVERY swing.<br />
<br />
Do I regret the envenom loss?  Not at all.  My crit strike and Axe skill will ensure I have a nice opening perf/creeping death.  Close to that of a pure critblade.  I use envenom for it's secondary abilities.  I LOVE the new snare.  It makes my styles hit over and over, they never leave my range.  I keep infectious on the second blade.  With that my damage is fast enough that I can overcome most heals.  I will not move envenom up one more drop.  The enervate line is nice, and the dot is much better, but that's just not how I do my damage.  I hit you hard and don't stop hitting you hard until you are dead.  And you WILL be dead!<br />
<br />
How's doublefrost in RVR?  Oh... my.... god.  You will love this style.  It is the &quot;stealther killer&quot;.  It's sometimes tough to setup a perf on an assassin or high stealth archer.  You lose them from target nearest enemy too fast to setup the front facing.  You don't need it.  Doublefrost is all you need.  It hits SO hard.  Against yellow con assassins/archers, you're looking at +120 to +150 on your style damage.  That makes my hits around 230-250, plus my leftaxe hit.  300ish damage a swing, they just have nothing to defend against it.<br />
<br />
What's the best thing about this template?  Pure and simple.  I can kill things that other shadowblades can't.  Where other shadowblades are dumping damage in the first few hits and praying.  I have a nice dump of damage in those hits and then I have something to push through the rest of their hitpoints... doublefrost.  I don't shy away from armored opponents.  In fact, I do some stuff that most people think are pretty insane!<br />
<br />
Suggestions to those following the soulblade path?  Hold the line.  Find the path you like and follow it.  It truly shines as you reach the 45ish area.  You'll truly shine.  It's hard to lay off envenom, it really is.  But in my opinion, getting your spec to 34cs/34la is your primary goal.  Once you hit it... you're golden.  Work on hitpoints!!!  Con and +hitpoint items are your friends.  You are going to be staying in fights where other assassins would be running.  You can't do this without alot of hitpoints and if possible Slash/Thrust/Crush resistance items.   <br />
<br />
At 46 as a kobold I have 1047 hitpoints with zero buffs.  My thrust and crush resists are beautiful.... I struggle against slashers, but the others die nice, I hope to up my slash resist next.  Leaves me in the fight a 2 or 3 more rounds, in which i get 3 more doublefrosts off!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
<br />
Stick with it, soulblades, you'll love it!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bia Bia</div><div class="date">04-21-02, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the input bile.<br />
<br />
im going with this temp:<br />
stealth 37<br />
left axe 39 (really want frostygaze)<br />
axe 39<br />
crit 34 (pa, cd)<br />
envenom 28<br />
<br />
im wondering what kind of pa's ill be able to get with crit at 34. i mainly just want creeping death for the stun, so i can get a few doublefrosts in.  but im considering leaving left axe at 34 and getting crit bumped higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jaxx</div><div class="date">04-21-02, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So there are three fantastic templates for an uber assassin that can be followed if you are an SB. Do you really need to rub it in though?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_lodidi</div><div class="date">04-25-02, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi you guys were talking about having these good moves with having left axe up high along with axe near or same as left axe. I was wondering do you need to keep sword lvled with axe and left axe to be a succeful dmg dealer as a sb?. <br />
<br />
I have a lvl 5 sb in guenivere that i just started yesterday i want to be a good dmg with dual wielding and have a good critical hit and of course stealth i am willing to sacrafice evenom for this. So would i have to keep sword, axe, and left axe to do this plz reply thx guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Killingu</div><div class="date">04-25-02, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iodidi, you are going to want to choose either axe or sword, once you choose then you are going to use that weapon for pretty much the rest of your SB's life. The left axe skill is what decides dual wield, in midgard you can only wield an axe in the second hand, that is why it is called left axe.<br />
<br />
On a second point, Bile which do you find more useful, the higher LA skill or the higher CS skill? I am trying to choose my final template and I am having issues deciding between 39 in CS or 39 in LA. There is another thread on this, but I was wanting to get your opinion as well. Thank ya.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ralis DeNatharr</div><div class="date">04-28-02, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why exactly do you call this template &quot;Soulblade?&quot; &lt; img src=&quot;http://www.valsmile.com/daoc/tlesig.jpg&quot;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gannex</div><div class="date">04-30-02, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey ya'll...I found the template I use very effective, albeit a bit weird. But here is the prospective specializations at level 50:<br />
<br />
37 stealth<br />
44 Crit Strike<br />
43 Axe<br />
34 Left Axe<br />
8 envenom<br />
<br />
From 1-25 I train in sword (much better styles) at 25 I switch to Axe (from new respec changes...), and also I wouldn't train at all in stealth until 24. 44 CS gives Rib Seperation which rocks. Also, you could leave envenom at 1, and bump up axe to 44 with AT until 24 and have 0 points left over, and have +7 in gear/Realm Rank, but the 44 axe style isn't incredibly useful (although in recent news they said they were going to change some of the styles that went off of rare events like fumbling, so who knows...). <br />
<br />
With only +5 to envenom, I can get the 3rd snare, and 3rd strength debuff. If I really need some poison damage, all I have to do is ask a guildmate.<br />
<br />
Also, I think they call it soulblade because it embodies the nature of a shadowblade- cold, hard damage. Just my opinion.<br />
I hope this has helped someone with creating their own shadowblade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-30-02, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure why they call it a soulblade.  Seems sort of fanciful.  To match the other names though, I think it ought to be called &quot;Critzerk.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dither DAoC</div><div class="date">05-01-02, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i assume it comes from the best fighting game ever made, and the first weapon to weapon combat game as well, Soul Edge.  The main weapon int he game was called the Soul Blade.  The plot tot his arcade was second to none, and the gameplay was fantastic.  On the playstation, the game was released as Soul Blade, and the followup to the game int he arcade was Soul Calibur, with that being released on the dreamcast as well.<br />
<br />
One of the first definitions of soulblade was something along the lines of: &quot;The shadowblade who relies on cold hard steel to do his killing, relying little on the use of envenom&quot; Dither Disgustipated<br />

<br />
Also, I currently use sword (was a critblade) and I will be switching to roughly your template for soulblade.  Should I go ahead and switch to axe/LA or stay sword/LA?<br />
BTW I am a lvl 50 Kobold SB with a plethora of swords so the switch will be a major money dump for me.<br />
<br />
Also I would appreciate anyones comment on this matter, just refering to Bile because he posted a template...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sullus14</div><div class="date">09-03-02, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imho, the soul-blade is a non-spec.  Anytime you leave one spec line weak at the expense of high LA/Main weapon you have a shadowzerk.  The only other really viable choices are a critblade spec with High CS/ No LA or a 5-spec routine.<br />
<br />
The nice thing is, the SB is one of the few classes that still has a choice about different ways to spec, the way Mythic INTENDED for all the classes in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Peyta</div><div class="date">09-03-02, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HIyas,I'm new to these particular boards,but I need some help on the soulblade template. Since you have this thread going,I figured I would ask for some opinions.<br />
<br />
My SB is 45.5 atm. She has been a pure critblade for a long time,but I keep hearing how bad they suck in RvR at 50. I have had no problems with mine,but I guess I should look into merging into a soulblade. The thing is...I need to make sure I am happy with my final,because I can only re-spec once,and I need to do it soon,since I only have .5 left before I can't use the full re-spec at all.<br />
<br />
This is what I would like to know: Do critblades suck at 50? If I should re-spec into a soulblade,is this template any good?<br />
<br />
Stealth 37<br />
CS  39<br />
LA  39<br />
Axe  36<br />
Env  25<br />
<br />
Now,I see from the posts above that most of you like the really low envenom. I would really hate to have env 7 or something,so I want to keep it decent enough so that I can at least snare them,and not be resisted.<br />
<br />
Also,one more thing: Does anyone know if you have to have Lifebane capabilities in order to use the Bloodfire poison that alchemists can make? I have read all the alchemy info,but have yet to see what lev env you would need to use it.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long post,as I know this topic has been beaten to death. I just really want some good opinions on this one,since it will pretty much make or break me at 50. Thanks!   Peyta Shadowdragon Lev 45 Shadowblade<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bia Bia</div><div class="date">09-05-02, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ill make it real easy<br />
<br />
crit 34. (give you PA. creeping, the meat and bones of the crit line)<br />
<br />
axe 39 (high enough for you to easily attain 50+)<br />
<br />
left axe 39 (gives you comback doublefrost and frosty gaze!!!! cash money, because you WILL EVADE)<br />
<br />
stealth 37 (with items and bonus an easy 50)<br />
<br />
envenom what i like to call left overs... : 27 (with little effort can be bummped into 40+... granted lifebane may be out of reach, but if your basing your temp around lifebane consider a new realm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aivenssar</div><div class="date">09-06-02, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also am doing something similar.. but deviating a bit.  I'm not worried about trying something new and i'm expecting a long hard road to getting there.<br />
<br />
I'm going 38 stealth, 42 envenom, 39 CS, 34 Left Axe, 33 Axe (this is witout + items)<br />
<br />
Now my reasoning, and how i'm getting there:  I'm autotraining stealth to 40.  Because of my guild I can basically do this.  I'm going to level quick and won't even visit the BG's.  That is giving me an extra 10 points to play with since it is autotrained at 1/4 my level.<br />
<br />
38 stealth is with the 10 autotrained.<br />
42 Envenom gives me the posibility to get Lifebane- hey. i like poison  <br />
39 CS gives me the full PA chain.<br />
34 LA gives me doublefrost.<br />
33 Axe seemed a bit low, but i had to suffer in one spot and i was sure there were +'s<br />
<br />
With the expectations of having + items and also the rewards of autotraining so far.. i think i should be alright and have fun with the template.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Winstons7770</div><div class="date">09-07-02, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im no assassin but you could probably drop env down to 39 since getting +11 from items (the cap) should be easy with SC going in and you could drop those points into axe.<br />
<br />
Ambiguous</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ZoldenShadowhunter</div><div class="date">11-18-02, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aiv, I'm not sure how long ago this post was made, but if you go with more than 39 in envenom you will be slapping yourself later. +11 to envenom is easily obtained with SC in now, and you will find realm ranks to make it easier if you didnt get the full +11 from SC.<br />
<br />
I'm going to be bringing envenom up to only 34. This way I get the 45 poison easily, and eventually after RR6 I will have access to lifebane which is not all that important anymore. Your points are better spent in bringing axe up even more for a bigger damage cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Svartalf Imposter</div><div class="date">11-21-02, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm level 50 SB, RR5, here's my new spec;<br />
<br />
34 axe<br />
39 Laxe<br />
34 CS<br />
37 envenom<br />
<br />
It works ok, and gives me the option of going 2H if I think I'm only gonna get chance to hit them once (keep attacks, hit and run on zergs, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cephlen</div><div class="date">12-04-02, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With your new soulblade template how much different is your PA damage then from your original critblade spec? I ask this because I have been a critblade since lvl 1 and I have been considering switching to something a little quicker but with a PA that is relatively close to a critblade spec.  Also I would like to hear more on your experiences with this template and especially why you switched from critblade to soulblade  <br />
