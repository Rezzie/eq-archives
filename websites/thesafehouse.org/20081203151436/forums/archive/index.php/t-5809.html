<br />
when you run and cast a spell, you end up in a wobbling, odd animation loop. try using jboots or goblin earring, then run forwards and watch yourself when you're done swinging your arms around. happens to me anyway (elf chick).<br />
<br />
also, goblin earring spam while running now makes your arms repeat the casting animation over and over again, like jboots.<br />
<br />
on the character selection screen, it seems that your char starts out with a spell or song-casting animation.<br />
<br />
not very important, but I noticed it :P</div></div><hr />

Also there are 3 camps of DEs in WC all wearing velious style armor and wouldnt talk to anybody that we could see.  They were indif and wouldnt assist when attacked (probably because they were very green at 52)  Just told you to get lost (basically) when hailed.<br />

I dont know if there is anyway to confirm this but I was told months ago by a Verant tech support guy that they were having problems with their routers and some areas of the country were worse off than others.</div></div><hr />

Sneak Hide is a GODSEND there as EVERYTHING will attack you no matter what level you are.<br />
<br />
The aggro radius on the casters is insane and thier damage shields were upped too.<br />
<br />
No more Crystallized Marrow drops  or Gynok Moltor either.<br />

<br />
Amusingly, I got disconned just after logging back into the zone as it came up and getting jumped by a couple of frogs.  A nearby shaman tried to help me while I was LD and got a real surprise when I apparently ENRAGED on the frogs trying to whup me.  Said it scared the bejezus outta him  <br />
<br />
I dunno what the deal is with connections lately, I've been dealing with borderline-unbearable lag the last few days - I'll lose conn to the server for about 15 seconds EVERY 30-45 seconds for a nice little string of 5-15 lag spikes.  It's still barely playable, but absolutely awful.  And I know it's not my personal connection either, because a lot of my groupmates were noticing the same problems.  -- Arafain Entreri, 57 Blackguard<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Saevan JNoir</div><div class="date">06-29-01, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was running ... er, sneak/hiding around Befallen last night, looking for a lost corpse (not mine), and guess who I saw? Good old Gynok. Unfortunately, someone else got to him first, but it's good to know he still spawns. Also saw Skeleton Llrod.<br />
<br />
At level 27, almost everything I saw on the first and second floors was green, with some blue behind the 2nd locked door. Almost all of the third floor was blue. I didn't see anything higher. I saw a couple of named DE's but didn't bother to stop for them. Lots of skeletons, DE's, and ghouls (called 'reanimated corpses' or something like that). The couple of blue that I did kill went down easy, but didn't drop much. Only loot I got was a Sr. apprentice robe (WOOT!), but I wasn't there long. I may head back later.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, lockpick of 130 (to 140) opened all doors, and no keys seemed to be dropping, according to the shouts I heard. Killing stuff gives you a hit to ResidentsOfBefallen, but everything seems to be KOS to everyone anyway.<br />

A fair number of things in L3 conned high green to me at 32nd; everything else was low green. Unfortunately, I was right clicking to con and clicked on a corpse by mistake (Doh!) and discovered I can't kill large numbers of green mobs by myself.
