I'm not sure if this one's kinda under the ground or if I'm just out of the loop, but I started watching this just a little while ago and I'm thoroughly impressed. Anyone else watching? S*** happens when you party naked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">03-31-04, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely not under the ground as you say.    It's a really great series.  When it first started I thought it was going to be solid fluff, but it can be a really intense show.  <br />
<br />
I take it you're not caught up to current then?  The last episode (25) really hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aurarier</div><div class="date">03-31-04, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, work and such keepin me from doin it. My roomie's up to 24, but I'm somewhere around 10-15. It makes me sad that they don't show anime like FMA on Adult Swim. I mean, Inu Yasha's fine, but FMA, Evangelion, .Hack, et al. so beat its ass. I wish they'd just spin Adult Swim off into another station so they could show anything they want. S*** happens when you party naked.</div></div><hr />

I got a burner and all, but DVD players don't play .avi's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-01-04, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Search for TMPGEnc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-01-04, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, so I converted one episode to DVD-NTSC linear audio format.<br />
<br />
What I ended up with is one .wav file and one .m2v file.<br />
<br />
...now what do I do with them?  If I just burn them onto a DVD will they play in a DVD player, or do I need to do something with them first?<br />
<br />
Crist, this is alotta work just to watch Naruto and play EQ at the same time...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">04-02-04, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think the next step is burn to dvd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">04-02-04, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget you will also need to do some adjustments to the video so that the subtitles won't fall into the overscan on your TV set.  I don't know how as I've never burned digisubs to DVD, but a while back when I read up on it, it was a hassle of a process.  That may not be the case now, but it does need to be done.  Otherwise you won't be able to read a lot of the subs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-02-04, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay what you need to do is use Virtualdub to add borders around the DVD and then convert it to MPEG-2 then it will play. I will post a more detailed guide later tonight if someone else hasn't already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-02-04, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good lord, well, I tried a different stream format(into .mpg instead of a .wav and .m2v) and heres what I've managed to make now.  Using the program you gave me, I turned 3 episodes from .avi files into Mpegs.  Then, using Roxio DVD creator, I made a &quot;movie&quot; format DVD that even has a menu that lets me pick what episode to play.  The program recognized the .mpegs and converted them into like 3 different files each when it burned the disc.  This disk, works perfectly on the computer even with all the files divided up and whatnot, but when I stick this disc in the DVD player it Reads for a long time then No Plays.<br />
<br />
Why again do I need to make borders?  When I'm playing the file on the PC I can see the subs just fine, does a television cut off alot of the bottom or something?<br />
<br />
And thats where I am now. Edited by: Ravenwinged Angel at: 4/2/04 11:46 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-02-04, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it cuts off a lot off all sides. Because subs are at the lowest portion of the screen, and often when they talk a lot the text goes from one end of the screen to the other, so it gets cut off.<br />
<br />
When I make One Piece on DVD, it is cut off about half the letters. To clarify, the letter &quot;l&quot; you would only see half of that letter, because overscan cuts it off.<br />
<br />
I really don't feel like making a guide myself right now so while flawed, here's a guide hopefully you can figure out what to do from it, if not, I might make a guide later on. Or it should at least give you a good idea of what needs to be done and you can improvise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-02-04, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy crap, I understood about none of that.  But, I should change the framerate apparently since I'm using 29....that or I should change to interlaced.<br />
<br />
Should I be using VDub to add borders before or after I convert the AVI to an mpeg? Edited by: Ravenwinged Angel at: 4/2/04 2:57 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-02-04, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, go to the Animesuki forums and look inside Tech Support, search for what you want to know, there are literally hundreds of posts on the same subject, you're bound to find what you want to know.<br />

Normally I'm okay with simply playing around and doing things through trial and error, but I'm just ruining alot of blank DVDs at this rate.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I figured out how to make VDub make borders, but when I try and apply borders to an episode of One Piece, using the sizes suggested by that guy from the link, and I try and resave the file, it tries to make the new coverted file as like 20gigs huge or some @#%$.  wtf is that??
