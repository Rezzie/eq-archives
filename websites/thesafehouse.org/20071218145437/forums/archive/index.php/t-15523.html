Basically, I've heard there are two types of builds, assassination and combat.  I want to make a combat rogue as it's more my playstyle.  What talents are critical for any build?  What talents are critical for a combat rogue?  What are helpful ones that aren't really neccessary but are highly suggested?  Thank you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crikey</div><div class="date">11-14-04, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the combat rogue I'm going with right now.  I think once I hit 60 and when battlegrounds are added in I probably will switch to a more subtlety/assassination type rogue.<br />
<br />
Assassination Talents (30 points)<br />
Improved Eviscerate - 3/3 points<br />
Malice - 5/5 points<br />
Ruthlessness - 3/3 points<br />
Improved Slice and Dice - 3/3 points<br />
Relentless Strikes - 1/1 point<br />
Lethality - 5/5 points<br />
Improved Instant Poison - 4/5 points<br />
Cold Blood - 1/1 point<br />
Seal Fate - 5/5 points<br />
<br />
Combat Talents (21 points)<br />
Improved Gouge - 3/3 points<br />
Improved Sinister Strike - 2/2 points<br />
Lightning Reflexes - 2/5 points<br />
Improved Backstab - 3/3 points<br />
Precision - 5/5 points<br />
Dagger Specialization - 5/5 points<br />
Blade Flurry - 1/1 point<br />
<br />
The goal here is to attack very fast and get in a lot of critical hits and build combo points.  Since I plan on doing most of my playing with a group, I'll be using backstab a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assassinate (21)-<br />
<br />
Imp. Eviscerate                         3 points<br />
Malice                                      5 points<br />
Ruthlessness                             3 points<br />

Relentless Strikes                      1 point<br />
Lethality                                    5 points<br />
Vile Poisons                              1 point<br />
Cold Blood                               1 point<br />
<br />
Combat (26)-<br />
<br />
Imp. Sinister Strike                    2 points<br />
Lightning Reflexes                     3 points<br />
Deflection                                 5 points<br />
Precision                                  5 points<br />
Dagger Spec.                           5 points<br />
Dual Wield Spec.                      5 points<br />
Blade Flurry                              1 point<br />
<br />
Subtlety (4)-<br />
<br />
Master of Deception                  4 points<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see a big reason to over-specialize in Subtlety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see a big reason to over-specialize in Subtlety.<br />
Improved Cheap Shot, Initiative, and Hemorrhage are snazzy.  I heart Improved Sap but that depends on how you play.<br />
<br />
Every tree has great talents IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like any sort of DOT based damage, as it throws my stun and prevents me from using back attacks during melee.<br />
<br />
Improved Sap would be nice, but I don't want to invest that heavily in Subtlety in order to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hemorrhage hasn't been a DOT for a long time now.  It's an instant weapon attack that debuffs the mob; while the debuff is on every melee hit the mob takes gets +X.  Hemorrhage also gives +1 CP and at 35 energy is the cheapest CP builder I know of offhand.<br />
<br />
I like Subtlety main / Assassinate secondary a lot because it allows you to be flexible.  You can open with either a +40% crit chance Ambush (soft targets, non elites) or a reduced-energy Cheap Shot (armored targets, elites)...toss a few low-energy Hem's for CPs...Evis at +15% if they're almost dead, or Kidney Shot to keep them locked down, or a +20% damage Rupture if it's a boss mob...etc.  Preparation has also helped me out a lot; I do a ton of tanking when I duo with my wife's Priest and being able to use Evasion multiple times on quest bosses is great.<br />
<br />
All in all, I'm very happy to see that almost every rogue loves their talent build, no matter how wildly varying the builds are.  Shows that the talents are pretty darn solid all around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dove</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree Berael, there are a ton of good ways to build a rogue talent wise. I have gone back and forth between about 5 different builds that I like myself.  As of today Im actually leaning towards a 31 point subtelty build with combat seconday. I think it will be effective, and subt/combat is probobly the least used combination of the three to focus on, so hopefully will be somewhat unique as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had pretty much been planning on 26 Subtlety, 25 Assassinate...then those bastiches moved Blade Flurry up to be more accessable - ARGH!  Decisions, decisions!  ;p<br />
<br />
Doing 26 Subtlety, 21 Combat, 4 Assassinate would give me Blade Flurry and the Precision and Dual Wield passives - both of which seem like huge advantages in any situation - while still retaining Malice 4 as well...but then I give up Cold Blood, Lethality, Improved Evis, Ruthlessness, Relentless...but on the other hand, Lethality was just nerfed...but on the other hand, Cold Blood is nice for those &quot;eat flaming Ambush doom&quot; moments...but on the other hand, Blade Flurry is useful in larger fights...sigh.  I need more talent points.  &gt;&amp;lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dove</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At first glance I loved the look of dual wield specialization also. I guess it was just me wanting to make my WoW just like an EQ rogue which doesnt take the 1/2 damage penalty. However, on further investigation I found out that getting max dual wield spec doesnt raise offhand damage to normal levels. Instead it raises it up 50% from the already 1/2 damage, or raises it to 75% normal damage in other words.<br />
<br />
I did some thinking and decided for 5 talent points that isnt worth it. At best I feel the talent is just 'ok' considering what it does.  Though it is still beta and if sometime down the road it gets changed to giving offhand weapon full damage then that changes everything, and it becomes a great talent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lord-69</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have played both betas rogues till 60 and then another to 35 - always undead. Now im leaning towards troll , more racial differences.<br />
I was wondering - who here has tried the dual mace rogue - i mean with Mace speciality 5% stun for 3seconds ... with Slice N dice .. seems pretty good for my 3rd rogue.<br />
My ass build is good but im getting sick of the build. Let me know how anyones mace build has turned out.<br />
<br />
Diabolique Test 4 ( 3rd tier lag-hell )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cevil</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree, there are several different ways to build a rogue whether it be for a pvp or pve style of play. I tried a few different builds before I got the one for me. I was really impressed to see that a rogue could be just as efficient with the right build and a pair of maces or swords, as one could with daggers. I think it makes grouping as a rogue alot funner because every rogue you team up with is unique.<br />
<br />
  Anyhow, here is what I will most likely use for my first rogue in retail, with assassination being my primary focus...<br />
<br />
Assassination Mastery--<br />
<br />
Malice-5max<br />
Improved Eviscerate-3max<br />
Ruthlessness-3max<br />
Relentless Strikes-1max<br />
Lethality-5max<br />
Improved Expose Armor-3max<br />
Vile Poisons-4<br />
Cold Blood-1max<br />
Seal Fate-5max<br />
Vigor-1max<br />
<br />
Combat Mastery--<br />
<br />
Lightning Reflexes-5max<br />
Deflection-5max<br />
Riposte-1max<br />
<br />
Subtlety Mastery<br />
<br />
Master of Deception-5max<br />
Opportunity-4<br />
<br />
And, yes I know...alot of points in assassination.</div></div><hr />

Some common questions:<br />
Why no defensive talents?<br />
1) in the event I do end up pvping frequently, dodge makes killing warriors even more difficult, as one of their best (if not best) pvp attack is based on you dodging them. High dodge % in PvP turns rogues to mush.<br />
2) Although that does leave the parry talent, my 31,12,8 build doesn't leave room in the combat line to put points there, 3% chance to parry is not as effective as 30% chance to crit on a bs.<br />
3) Finally this build is very paper tiger, that is to say you kill them fast and with as much precision as possible; putting points into defensive talents hurt your offense greatly, and really (after testing) end up leaving you with less health generally (granted, there are exceptions, but with a good assassination build, as I feel this is, you tend to either come out without a scratch, or quite beat up, with skill you minimize the latter and genereally know by the start if you are going to survive. If things arn't looking good, pop and improved gouge and run)<br />
<br />
Why assassination? Isn't combat better for soloing and non-situational dmg? Isn't part of beinga  rogue is doing well in every situation?<br />
1) Although a combat build is more reliable, it is also weaker. In addition, and more importantly (becasue the reliability is only slightly higher and the numbers are only slightly less) I believe the assassination build takes more talent and player skill to master; also, it is slightly more rewarding - if you are good at ti you will be doing more dmg then a combat rogue, both solo and group pve, and pvp. Basically, I would rather be known as a good player because of my knowledge of the game and my skill at playing my class then the gear on my character or the gold in my bank.<br />
2) some argue that rogues are 'versatile and adaptive' and although I agree that is true, the jack-of-all-trades, swis army knife persona is one I have never particularly liked, as such, by focusing on an assasination build, I believe I am following my conceptions more closely, I prefer the sneaky, assassin-like rogue to the dungeoneering one.<br />

Why did you choose xxxxx instead of yyyyyy?<br />
Not gonna go through each choice now, but if you have specific questions I can answer you.<br />

Unfortunately, logging in beta proves the above statement very wrong.  Combat non-dagger builds were the highest sustained dps builds found in beta.</div></div><hr />
