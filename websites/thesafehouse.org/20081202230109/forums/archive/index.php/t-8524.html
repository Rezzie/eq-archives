Quote: When you give him the crunchies you get a note or something to Torsten then you run back and forth relaying messages between the two. <br />
Bregun gives you a &quot;Bixie Charm&quot; which in turn you give to Torsten. You then give a Note back to Bregun, then a Book back to Torsten with your first Earring to get #2. (just to clear that up, as I was confused myself).<br />
<br />
If you do not wish to make the Bixie Crunches to get the charm, simply kill Bregun and loot the Bixie Charm yourself.</div></div><hr />

Also note, Custos Armorum etc. are all level 60. They can triple for 127 or so. Most are hasted as well. That's a HUGE jump in difficulty from Earring 2 to Earring 3. However the stats are a HUGE jump as well. 2 to 6.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Galiana Elessedil</div><div class="date">02-13-02, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently did the second earring with a cleric friend. Being a druid, I invised him after he opened the trade window with the File Cabinet. Then I invised myself. He clicked trade, got the report, the guard popped, but didn't attack because he couldn't see us. I laughed my head off. Save yourself the grief by taking a druid with you to do the exchange and have the druid invis himself as well as you and you won't get a scratch.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't see the earring being worth the trouble. I killed the four mobs in Seru with one of the top guilds on my server. It's way too much trouble for an earring no better than an Ivandyr's Hoop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fenchu</div><div class="date">02-13-02, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm not sure how Ivandyrs comes remotely close to the 4th earring...<br />
<br />
First off you dont need to kill the Head Praesertums for earring 3....this earring is somewhat comprable but can you upgrade Ivandyrs hoop to an ac15 with buku stats ear??<br />
<br />
So while the lower earrings may not &quot;seem&quot; worth it, they lead to a much more desireable ear slot then the hoop so many people want to compare this to..</div></div><hr />

[Thu Feb 14 22:54:31 2002] You say, 'Hail, Tilbok Furrunner'<br />
[Thu Feb 14 22:54:31 2002] Tilbok Furrunner says 'Hello there, Moro.  Pleasure to meet you, I am Governor Tilbok Furrunner.  I am tasked with the gathering and security of information for the Concilium Universus, the ruling council of our fine city. '<br />
[Thu Feb 14 22:54:34 2002] You say, 'what chambers?'<br />
[Thu Feb 14 22:54:53 2002] Tilbok Furrunner says 'According to these reports Seru resides in a building called the Arx Seru.  It is the large complex in the center of the four Praesertum Consillium. We must take [action] now.  Do not underestimate the power of Sanctus Seru for what they do they feel is right. '<br />

[Thu Feb 14 23:01:45 2002] You say, 'what kind of action'<br />
[Thu Feb 14 23:01:45 2002] Tilbok Furrunner says 'You must go see Lcea.  She was Tsaph Katta's closest advisor.  This matter has escalated greatly and must be placed in her hands.  Ask her about the [Arx Key] she will no doubt ask in your service retrieving it.  I salute your service to the city and wish you well. '<br />
<br />
[Thu Feb 14 23:03:59 2002] You say, 'what arx key'<br />
[Thu Feb 14 23:03:59 2002] Lcea Katta says 'The Arx Key, yes.  I have read the compiled reports that have been brought to us and it seems to gain access to Arx Seru you need four shards, one from each Praesertum leader.  When the time is ready each leader inserts their shard into the door of Arx Seru at the same time, and they are transported within the building. We need you to retrieve the four shards.  When you have done so seek out Elnerick Augustleaf, and tell him that you serve Katta.  His powers over the arcane are great and I believe he can form the shards into a single master key.  Once you have received the Arx Key, place the seal given to you by Elnerick and your Runed earring in this jewel box and give it to me.  I eagerly await your return. '<br />

[Thu Feb 14 23:08:55 2002] Elnerick Augustleaf says 'Greetings Moro. I am Magistrate Elnerick Augustleaf of Katta Castellum and the Loyalist Empire. If it is arcane knowledge that you seek you have come to an excellent place to study. Not only do we have wondrous magical resources available at the Magus Conlegium but the teachings of Tsaph Katta are well known to all of our citizens and aid in preparing the mind for the freedom of thought and mental and emotional discipline needed to become a great wizard.

[Thu Feb 14 23:09:08 2002] You say, 'i serve katta'<br />
[Thu Feb 14 23:09:08 2002] Elnerick Augustleaf says 'Ah, I was told you would come.  I hope that you have retrieved the shards from each Praesertum Leader?  Please show them to me. '</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Abbu</div><div class="date">02-21-02, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The general consensus of the first two threads was that Torsten was on Heart of Seru faction.  People talked about killing rescusos on hours on end to raise their sseru faction.  With some knowledge of the story behind this quest one would conclude that this is false and killing the rescusos is not needed.  It would seem logical to me that Torsten is on Katta Faction, perhaps Validos Custodus.<br />
<br />
As far as faction needed.  I have tried to get earing one twice now.  I was threateningly with torsten and used sneak (im a monk) to raise my faction to indifferent.  I gave the bixie charm to torsten and got his text saying &quot;here is the note to bregun&quot; but the note did NOT appear in my inventory.  I then did the quest over again with the same faction and got the SAME result.  I'm thinking you MUST have indifferent or higher faction to get earing 1.  Indifferent without invis/sneak/hide that is.<br />
<br />
I'll be working on the 4reports FIRST before I get the first earing.  Why?  I need Validos Custodos faction for the first earing.  Killing the guards the drop the reports im assuming give +validos custodos faction and therefore I'll be killing two birds with one stone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S-I would not read the previous threads on this topic.  They will confuse you more then anything.  The only thing I'd like to add is that you can kill bregun for the bixie charm.  I think everything else is pretty nicely summed up in the first post in this thread....<br />

<br />
Update: Double check your bank for a note to bregun dory.  I killed mobs in echo caverns and looted this note, before I heard of this quest.  I forgot I had it , and this was the reason why i was not recieving the note back.  It had nothing to do with sneak and sneak does work for earing 1/2.  I got them being scowl, and using sneak.<br />

Now go read my post again. Exactly where was I being an ass?<br />
<br />
Let's start with a few things: One, School is a good thing. Learn to spell moron. The name is Apollohades. Simple enough if you've ever picked up a single book that had oh... mythology in it. Bulfinch is a good start, but I think it's beyond you and Curious George books.<br />

Two: I asked for links you inbred twit. If you had graduated from the 4th grade you may have been able to decipher that with your batman decoder ring.<br />
<br />
Three: It's my understanding that the mods don't like it when people bring up the same thing in several different posts, hence, number 2, my asking for those links. I wanted to go through what people had to say myself. Unlike you, I decided to skip out on eating lead paint. I like to think for myself.<br />

How about some clue as to how rare?  On my server, the estimation is that the various guilds working on it have killed appx 700 of these mobs between them, and not a one of us has gotten a single note.  Is this really how rare they are or do we have some sort of loot table issue going on?  We've been trying for notes for 3 weeks now.  No one has gotten a single one.</div></div><hr />

I have the 3rd earring now, and working on my last 2 shards.  If yer questioning whether or not you're killing the right mobs, just focus on those mobs that guard the two portals in each consillium.  Kill the 2 on the bottom, then move to the top floor and kill those mobs by the portal.  Each consillium holds a different amount of report NPC's, with Heart being the most frequently dropped.

<br />
Yes you can kill Bregun for the charm. If he isn't up then go buy the cider in Sanctus and hand to the correct guard. The Guard isn't always up it seems, there are 3 up usually, dunno if he was killed or despawned tho. Helps to have a tracker to find Bregun of course, if you don't he pops in Trog caves in a corner junction and is small  <br />
<br />
Bregun made me work damn hard to kill him as a 57 Epic ranger. He has alot of HP but not particularly MR. No Faction hit.<br />
<br />
Euzan was to be found on the 2nd floor of the building at that location, in a little room by himself facing a bookshelf.<br />
<br />
Yes the Filing Cabinet can be tracked (Picture it now, Ranger stops, gestures to his party...i have spore..it seems to be quite fresh from the dung..its..its..a FILING CABINET!!)<br />
<br />
Sneaking or wolf form works for the hand in. Unless using the partner to invis you a guard will attack, easy kill at 57 tho he did summon me. No Faction hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and 4th forget about it-requires killing the minibosses.<br />
<br />
there are 4 mini bosses one in each of the &quot;guild buildings&quot; <br />
go inside the building to the top of the steps then go around to one of the 2 corridors walk to end and click on the translucent shield to get to floor 4 in the center is a door with 2 guards inside door is a conference table, and another door, thru that door is the miniboss - all the buildings are pretty much exactly the same.<br />
<br />
boss names:<br />
<br />
rhugol<br />
matpa<br />
vantorus<br />
bikun<br />
<br />
the fights require strategy since:<br />
1: the boss will NOT path out beyond the conference room<br />
2: boss has a dain like process-bout 1 player every 12seconds or so.<br />
3: walls are BAD---poofing problems in seru and fighting against walls.<br />
<br />

oh and the reports drop from other spawn than the 4 listed.....   <br />

After I got the charm I took it to Torsten Reidan and received the note to Bregun, but he wasn't up (since I killed him), so I decided to try to spawn him with the Cider.   I got the 'he is in the Trog caves somewhere' message from the guard (Dalanai (sp?)) he didn't pop.  I thought that I broke the quest until the next server restart when I killed Bregun.<br />

<br />
As for Bregun Dorey, just have whoever is doing the quest buy 2 Dawnshroud ciders.  One is to spawn Bregun after handing into Dalini, then killing Bregun to get the charm.  The second cider is used again to spawn Bregun after the fact you killed him    It worked lastnight, and took us a little under 1 hr to do both 1 and 2.<br />

Kill one of the Scounds in plate armor in Echo Caverns in front of the SK/Warrior/Rogue guild. They are easy.. hit for 120's, 8.5k HP, and very small MR. They drop &quot;Sealed Letter to Bregun Dorey&quot; for some odd reason. Whether it's a bug, I don't know, but they do drop it. Hand a Cider into the Legionnaire in Netherbain to spawn Bregun.

<br />
Assuming you are KoS to both Katta and Seru factions (which means your probably worship Inny or Cazic, if my theory is correct) the best way to go about this quest is to jump straight to killing the 'report dropping mobs'. This will do 2 things. First, factions in Seru are wierd, killing one faction may raise others. You will also be raising Katta factions as you go.<br />
<br />
After mindless hours of killing these guys (at least that's what it sounds like, I personally havn't tried yet), you will most likely be non KoS to some Seru factions, and hopefully non-KoS to Katta as well. At this point, head out to Mars Seru (The zone that is right outside Seru, not Dawnshroud, the other one), and kill Recusvos. The only faction you don't get from doing this is Citizens of Seru (which isn't really important because the merchants are on Shoulder) and Seru (who cares because your going to be killing him anyway, that is why your doing the quest, right?).<br />
<br />
You need Katta to get the quest from the NPCs and Seru to be able to walk into the city. As someone else posted before, yeah you could go on some sort of psycho killing spree and kill everything in the zone, therefor not having to get Seru faction, however if your server is like the one I just quit because of, half the people don't know where Seru is, nor who Katta is, or why they hate each other.<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER: Please note that I have not done step 1 of this quest because of the Katta faction requirements. I am not basing my post off of knowledge of the quest, just off my knowledge of the faction system on Luclin.</div></div><hr />

I don't think there are many folks on my server doing these quests as Sanctus is ALWAYS empty. Anyway, just a little info to add and 1 question. After doing most of the Sanctus Quests, Eye of Trust, Praetors Blade, Zelniak Meat x 500, etc. and also doing most of the Katta quests that I couls as well, I am now KOS to the Arx. I was hit by one of those guardians as I was walking through and it took me by surprise. I imagine these are on thier own faction, as I don't see them linked to eye,heart,hand, or shoulder. <br />
<br />
My quesiton is what lvl are the earring 3 mobs? I mean the ones in the 4 houses that drop the reports, and how many people are needed to take them out. They con red to me at 51, and was trying to figure how many I should bring..I imagine they would be good exp.<br />

The guard was very easy once they were slowed. Alot of hp. The only thing sucked is when you go upstair to kill more guard then the 2 who spawn on 3rd floor there a couple of roamer guard who can add to the fight so that can be a pain since the guard can be pally chanter (well in hearth temple)<br />

We had a 60th Warrior, 60th Cleric, 59th and 58th Rangers. With defensive up the max they hit me for was 116, the rest were in the 80-100 range but they hit fast.<br />
We took them out fairly easy but with the cleric down to 1m after each one. The other mobs on the floor will not aggro through the doors, so your only concern are pats  in the hallway. The mobs wearing the robes dispell so I would suggest you crap buff before attacking those. I would also suggest that you have a full standard group for these as to reduce downtime and to be prepared for any adds.<br />

<br />
I'd actually have trouble getting people from my guild to go there and kill these 4 people anyway, since non kill in seru in the first place, but to do it for 30 hours is definately out of the question. The third earring is very nice, my 55 druid would use it, but its not worth this. As I say I'd go for it if people were doing seru for xp in the first place, but I don't know anyone who is.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll hold out for the various rare earrings that we seem to be getting sometimes on big luclin or other boss guild raid mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed somone post that he got 4 reports in 4 hours killing the mobs near the portal in each consillium. After reading that my group clicked on the porter zone to the portion of the consillium where we we'ren't fighting (the side your on when heading towards the exit from sseru)  and killed the guard there. Not sure if it was just luck but the first one we killed dropped a report. This was in the eye consillium and the mob who dropped it was chealed about 7 times through the wall.<br />
<br />
Our group then broke up to go to a raid and i haven't been back since, but I was wondering if other ppl noticed that the guards right next to the portals dropped reports more frequently, or if anyone had gotten a report off a diffrent guard.  These may be less rare then we think if we kill the correct mobs.</div></div><hr />

With my shaman i could not see or target him even with see invis.  I took my druid to Neth and Bregun was standing right in front of me even though i still couldnt see him with my shammy.  Assisted my druid and he popped out of nowhere and attacked me cause i hit him.  Zoned came back and i could see him /shrug.  Not sure if this is or has happened to anyone else i just thought it was pretty odd.  Think Torsten and Euzan are on Katta faction btw.</div></div><hr />

That wasn't a hint, it was straight out telling you where they can also drop if you put even a slight amount of thought into it.<br />

I think tiwiggie is saying that once you get one 4th earring you can port into the stronghold and kill there to get more reports for other earrings. Let's hope they drop quicker if this is true.</div></div><hr />

you obviously have not spent nearly as much time here as you should.<br />

If you have, you would know that CoH does work in this zone, just not in Seru's Arx building. If you didnt know this, you probably shouldnt be attemping to kill one yet</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Teramenor</div><div class="date">03-18-02, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm a bit confused. I've done the first 2 earrings no problem, and now I'm on to the third.<br />
<br />
From what I understand, I need to kill one particular mob in each of the 4 consillium buildings (the Hand/Heart/Shoulder/Eye buildings surrounding the Arx, in the center of Sanctus Seru).<br />
<br />
I was exploring the consillia yesterday. They all seem to be identical in layout, with a few minor differences; on the top floor of each is a hallway that leads to a mob guarding one of those translucent teleporter panels. If you click the teleporter panel, you are teleported into a warren of tunnels beneath that consillium, inside which you will find many more of that type of mob. For example, on the third (top) floor of the Consillium of the Heart, you will find a Lictor of the Heart guarding the portal, at coordinates (-727, -624, +122). If you click on the portal he/she is guarding, you will find yourself in a maze of tunnels filled with many many more Lictors of the Heart.<br />
<br />
WHICH OF THESE MOBS DROPS THE REPORT? The initial post indicates that the guardian NPCs on the third floor are the ones that actually drop the report -- but many of the posts in this thread indicate that the reports drop off the mobs from the underground mazes. If I only have to kill 4 NPCs to do this quest (3 of them conned even at 60, and one conned red), rather than farming them for endless hours, my faction will not go down nearly as fast, which is (to me) preferable.<br />
<br />
If anyone has PERSONALLY killed the 3rd-floor guardian NPCs I've referred to, and had them drop the reports, then answer me this: Do they drop the report every time, or am I better off farming underground? What's the respawn time? How hard are they (HP/max damage)? Do they cast any spells? Will other NPCs assist them? What's the safest way to kill them? Pleased be detailed and specific  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Teramenor</div><div class="date">03-18-02, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On another note...<br />
<br />
If you're looking for Legionnaire Dalini in Netherbian, he can spawn at either of the two static guard posts right next to the Marus Seru zoneline. There are 3-4 other guards who can spawn there, also, and there's no faction hit for killing these guards -- they respawn in about 12 minutes, so if Dalini's not up, just start smacking them down until he respawns. (The wandering guard who paths from Marus Seru down toward the central pillar is not a placeholder for Dalini.) Giving the items to Reothe in Marus Seru does NOT trigger Dalini or have any apparent affect on him, so you can skip that part of the quest completely, if you're so inclined.<br />
<br />
Also, Bregun Dorey does not despawn when you give him the Bixie Crunchies or the Note to Bregun, so once Bregun is up, you can have any number of people finish that part of the quest. Killing Bregun is not hard, but it's also unfriendly, especially since Bixie Crunchies are so easy to get (triv at 46, and bixie parts drop commonly -- any vendor in Misty Thicket is likely to have some on them that they bought from a player).</div></div><hr />

<br />
My whole friggin' POINT was that ONLY ONE MOB spawns at the coordinates given in the first post (which I have now read about 30 times) and repeated a couple posts prior to this one. Do the mobs down in the maze drop the reports AT ALL, or do ONLY the mobs on the 3rd floor guarding the teleporters drop the report, and you just have to wait for them to respawn over and over, or can you go down into the maze, and farm all the mobs down there for the reports?</div></div><hr />

Santus Seru is a city, therefore you could bind there.  If everyone binds and a wiz waits in the dungeon, couldn't he just TL banished people back to bind, which could be right back at the fight?<br />
