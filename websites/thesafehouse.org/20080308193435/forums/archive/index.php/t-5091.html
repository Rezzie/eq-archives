<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_zeemee</div><div class="date">06-06-02, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I did some tests with my 2 main weps to determine which weapon finished a fight faster if there even was a difference. <br />
<br />
2hand slot - Tuskers old Wound 100% quality and condition 13.2/3.4 effective DPS 12.0 <br />
Left hand slot - Serrated Lion Fangs. 10.8/2.5 <br />
Right hand slot - Huge Sharpened Boar Tusk 12.6/2.6 100% quality &amp;amp; condition effective DPS 12.0 <br />
<br />
I attacked about 20 yellow rooters without using poison and 'only' using amethyst slash. I used stats only where i never missed. (I almost never missed on all attacks anyway) I also didn't count the lone left hand hit for 40 damage. <br />
<br />
I also checked my xp after the kill and used stats from equal xp kills only. (about 5 mil xp) and about 900 hp damage to kill. <br />
<br />
I check the timer from &quot;you enter combat&quot; to &quot;the rooter dies&quot; times <br />
<br />
I managed to kill the rooters in 21 seconds with the slow weapon. <br />
I managed to kill the rooters in 24+ seconds with the fast weapon. <br />
<br />
Side Note: It looks like a round is about 4 seconds and DOTs tick just under every 4 seconds too. <br />
<br />
So with my first round of tests my conclusion is the slow weps end a fight faster when using 1 main style. I will try some more tests and wanted to get your inputs on this info. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">06-20-02, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is somewhat dependant on style.  As a shade, I always use my 2.2 delay blades over my 4.0 delay blade - mostly because in PvE I tend to rely nearly exclusively on hamstring/leaper, and in RvR, I just want to get as many shots in as possible.  Reactionary styles with slow weapons are far easier to pull off with fast weapons than slow - Particularly, the PA - evade - CD - double evade chain combo.<br />
Also, for CD and DW, since we aren't guaranteed to swing both, using fast weapons will on average get poisons app;<br />
The reason the slow weapon does better in a head on battle is because it essentially gets a free swing, (No delay before first swing) which for a slow weapon is far more beneficial than a fast weapon.</div></div><hr />
