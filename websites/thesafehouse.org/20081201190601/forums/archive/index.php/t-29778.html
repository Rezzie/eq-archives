<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pedric Cuf</div><div class="date">05-01-07, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to ascertain whether or not this game would be palatable on a dial-up connection. I know that the box lists it as a minimum requirement which is always a good barometer, but I've read some conflicting reports elsewhere in just a few hours of browsing the internets. Perhaps that's just the inevitible release lag until they get things settled down. I think that the most important question I can ask, then, follows.<br />
<br />
What is the collision detection of the game like? Only between players and scenery? Between friendly players? Between player and friendly NPC? Player and hostile NPC?<br />
<br />
This is a very important question to me and will likely determine if I pick up the game or not. For reference, I can play WoW just fine, even after BC, when they upgraded the minimum requirement from dial-up to broadband. I do lag/disconnect in massive mob encounters such as Razoregore, but barring those fights which the developers intentionally create to annoy me, and me alone, I'm right as rain.<br />
<br />
The Burglar class looks very entertaining and what I've been looking for out of a Rogue class ever since I picked up EQ.</div></div><hr />

I know for certain you can walk through other friendly players. I haven't done Monster play yet so I'm not sure if you can in that situation. I have been in one duel (spar) so far and I think there was no collision detection with my opponent in that situation but I can't be certain (it was a rather hectic fight and mobs were around).</div></div><hr />
