Consensual PvP, evil supervillians and more! *woot*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, I can see everyone playing villains and not having any opponents ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking the exact same thing Pratell.  Would be neat to see large battles between sides decide how the city is run.  Like, at first the villains have to hide out, but they defeat the heroes and the villains take over.  It's now the Heroes turn to hide out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunno, while playing a villian might be fun - and something I will try for sure, the current heroes aren't necessarily that shining.. so I don't need to play a villian.<br />
<br />
My scrapper with Dark Melee and Dark Armor certainly isn't a paragon superhero... he's more of a villian that decides to fight evil instead of good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I second that notion. It really needs to be fully consentual PvP to maintain the fun factor the game currently has. It should also have severely reduced or nonexistent XP debt for getting killed by other players for the same reasons, but some new point system for ranking players against each other. (bounties or whatnot)<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that based on the name, they'll add a whole second city that's PvP in the expansion so the players happy with the original game don't suddenly find the game isn't what they originally paid for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they want to go weird, they could use the Bizarro thing and have a parallel universe with cross over points.</div></div><hr />

Heh, reminds me of the kids in the graveyard in the Spawn movie. Something like &quot;How come God gets 1st choice for servants and all I get are the retards&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">snicker, that's such a great line. the movie wasn't that great, but that line cracked me up.<br />
<br />
They've repeated several times it will be consentual PVP only, including team pvp so I suspect there will be a system similar to Dark Age, combined with a dueling option. Plus there's the arenas coming hopefully.<br />
<br />
I don't actually like pvp, and have rarely ever played (was on Tallong it's first night before it broke, then hit vallon for a bit. but I hate the teeny freaks spamming you with idiotic insults) I have no real interest in pvp in COH, but I'll be glad to see they give some people the option since it's obviously been requested enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grendl nighthunter</div><div class="date">05-12-04, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, out of all the mmos I have played, DAoC had my favorite PvP...  I would say taht SB had good pvp as well, but didnt have that much experience in it...  It seemed that class balance wasnt much of an issue in SB, since you HAD to travel in packs....  Ic ant imagine CoH having balanced pvp....  seems like that would be a nightmare to tune.</div></div><hr />

That reminds me, I need to watch it again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I first read that I thought you said, &quot;evil supermodels&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&amp;lt;eyes roll back into head&gt;<br />
<br />
Consensual PVP with supermodels :heart</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I have to note though, that making PvP purely consensual is not enough in my opinion.<br />
<br />
They also have to make sure that there is NOTHING in the game that PvP players can obtain for their characters that non-PvPers can't.<br />
<br />
SWG had that problem.  Yeah, you never HAVE to do PvP, but if you don't everyone who does has access to stuff 10x better than you.<br />
<br />
And you know what, **** that!  I don't want to PvP!  But I don't want to SUCK either just because I choose not to.<br />
<br />
That said, I was looking forward to CoV, but like that other guy said, my hero is already pretty evil looking.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for those Villian missions though!<br />
<br />
Mission:  Take 5 hostages and Set 5 Bombs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna be kinda of hard to do missions while I am griefing you........<br />

 :backstab  :stalk  :stalk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pimpsareus</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Darth Ender. I dont think PvPers should have unique rewards that are better than the people who choose not to. Then again i never liked to PvP much unless it was against my friends on account of the fact that i sucked at PvP forever. I would like to see a duel system though. <br />
<br />
But then again i dont have the CoH yet so what do i know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But then again i dont have the CoH yet so what do i know?<br />
<br />
Not enough to get the overnight shipping, it seems! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaeden</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you guys will really like it.  It's never a gank-fest the way it's 'currently' set up.<br />
To be honest, it almost plays like Unreal Tournament.  But having the extra dimension of combat (flight, jumping, speed) really mixes it up.<br />
There are so many 'ambush' things players can do, its great.  But then one well placed knockback and travel power, and your prey escapes.  :lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm holding you to that mr &quot;The Stinker&quot;!<br />
<br />
heheh. Ironically at first I didn't read the name of the poster and almost started drilling questions in case they had a playable COV demo at E3 hehe.  :kroe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaeden</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe yeah, I only had 'Jaeden The Stinker' on EZ because I lost my original Jaeden info.<br />
IMO the coolest part about being a villain is that the daily play is actually going to play much different than being a hero.<br />
I mean, you dont just see the Joker walk down the street do you?  :evil</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you get a chance to look over our suggestions for more costume option and can let us know if any of them are in Update 1 it would be cool, but no pressure, I'm sure you got the hounds on your heels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaeden</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh we totally have an ongoing list of stuff we snag from those big costume wish lists.  We even have our own wish list here at work. :)<br />
Only one guy did the entire costume creation system and art, and he's pretty much the only one that works on it.  Unfortunately he's had to move onto other things for the time being.  But he totally plans on adding more, particularly once we start doing player villain stuff.<br />
I'll give you a hint though, he's currently working on the #1 most requested costume piece.  And very close to getting it 'look just right' ;)</div></div><hr />

I was halfway through designing a mace tanker named The Big Baby when I realized there are no proper bonnets for that costume.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />

Im a fan of stainless steel codpieces myself.<br />
So I put em on one of the new villains... Nyahaha!</div></div><hr />
