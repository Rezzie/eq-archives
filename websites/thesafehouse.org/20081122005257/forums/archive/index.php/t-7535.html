<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Elegance</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What zones, What areas, What lvls?<br />
For a newb de the area over the mountain behind the wiz portal in nektulos is good til 5th then cross the road to the river   there are 2 trees with white trunks go between them to the river and there is what I call the boat launch. you can walk under the water and not be swimming there, even take a pet down there and be out of sight the whole time.<br />
<br />
at around 17th my barb and a monk went hunting in neriaks 3rd gate til 20 or so. there are 5 ghouls, ratraz, and molon that you can just cycle for fast easy exp and you can bind there as well.<br />
<br />
20th the warlord room (maybe 21st) coinsidered to low for the room we had no trouble there (same rogue monk combo)<br />
<br />
24/25th the ancient croc in upper guk. one tuff basterd to kill at 24th (monk was 25th) but we lvled there til 28th with 3 deaths from mobs and 1 pk death each (same fight I coulda zoned but bagged up and went after em.) <br />
<br />
29th or so   thurgadin mines blue white and yellows find a spot and pull to it. (Note a healer is Very nice in this zone for the occasional over pull) one thing I dont like is the way you have to chase down mobs in here. I never ran out of stamina like I have in the last day or 2.  Oh yeah no monk its an sk now. added benifit of close binding as well.<br />
<br />
  I imagine the mines will be good for a couple more lvls but then we are off to find another remote/odd place to hunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OH yeah kerra isle hunted there for a few til the monk found out he needed to be able to Quest there, Crazy exp and not one person the whole time we were there. had the zone to our selves. good around 18 - 23 I would imagine depending on group size.<br />
<br />
<br />
how bout you, where do you go when lvling is more important than loot/pkin/getting GANKED?<br />
<br />
nerkiak and thurgadin allow for the melee ch to work to your benifit if your group is just melees without spells. (if the monk is low health and the spawn is due kill him its faster than healing up the slow way)<br />
<br />
note the above were all done with a group of 2 one monk/rogue combo up to thurgdin where it has been rogue/sk/cleric but would still be easy to do.  with the monk tanking and their mend down time is slight. Diabalein Avidya <br />

I've never seen a pk or seen someone get pk'd anywhere deeper.. or as deep as.. trakanon's teeth.<br />
I personaly hunt wherever the hell i want, unless it's a pk heavy outdoor zone.  In dungeons i'm way safe. 											Cylant Butdeadly<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-08-01, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, was probably my corpse ;p Anyway, since 30 I have been hunting in CC and there generally aren't many PK's if any there. Occasionally there are, but the only one's I've seen are enchanters (*shrug* wierd). Granted, there's usually not many other people in there, but you and a partner can do the two orcs that spawn in the tunnel, or try the broken bridge room and the two terrors at the top of the stairs as well. If you do it properly its easy to single pull the two terrors as well.<br />
<br />
Exp is getting kinda crappy here though, I'm thinking of heading to OT of CoM soon.<br />

I tried to get yer attention on a post about groupin but I guess you werent around for a couple days there. Sounds to me like just a little bad luck, but there have been 2 or 3 hard core pk guilds out in force every time I'm in velious, and its just a bitch when half your group gets jumped durring a fight. <br />

I cannot tell you how much exp I have lost to failed pk's, but Im guessing I would be several lvls higher if I had never had one of these retards in my eq life.<br />

Elegance is on a Roll these days. I took down 2 more casters the other day in ndr. this time It was ALL them. I mean what moron starts casting on a melee when they are fighting a critter already? Diabalein Avidya <br />

<br />
bluebieism lol THANKS.<br />
<br />
nah I am just getting tired of people to stupid/uncareing to realise they have almost no hope of pulling off a pk and end up causeing you an exp death instead, and there is next to nothing you can do about it. I mean really, I watched some caster root a melee with this huge train on his ass, of course he dropped like a rock. He was dead before the caster could get off one more freakin spell. that and getting trained by hiv when I was oor of them and they had just toasted half of my group (during a huge fight of course) <br />
<br />
yes people like this give pvp a bad name. <br />
<br />
yes I wanna kill YOU! <br />
no I do not wanna make you spend then next 2 hours getting your corpse and regaining the lost exp I caused you. (well ok once but he was BEGGIN for it damn corpse campers) Diabalein Avidya <br />
