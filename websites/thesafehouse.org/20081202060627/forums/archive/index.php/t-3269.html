<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loreleli</div><div class="date">07-18-02, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">why am I evil for asking to be paid? or for an advance on payment?<br />
<br />
I'm a rogue, get it? <br />
<br />
I'm not some knight or something working under a vow of poverty!<br />
<br />
I'm a sneak thief who when offered a job asks for payment. Otherwise, without payment, i&quot;m a serf, not an adventurer!<br />
<br />
I have bills! new armor and weapons I want. Healing potions are not free ( for the most part *wink*)<br />
<br />
I tried doing a few free things to get back to neutral, no dice, gah!<br />
<br />
Neutral (50) Evil (23)<br />
<br />
why, oh why would they ever think a rogue's prime motivator would not be gold?<br />
<br />
we like the shiney stuff! <br />
<br />
Now, if I took faction hits for robbing people ( stealing from their chests right in front of them) that I could understand. But, doing a job and expecting payment..grrr... it makes no sense. <br />
<br />
And, I have not lied to anyone, even when they made the option available.  <br />

<br />
The cash rewards from quests were pretty minor compared to what I accumulated elsewhere.  I ended the game with alignment Neutral (0) Good (100) (The Benefactor) and around 340, 000 gp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hummerlein</div><div class="date">07-18-02, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just put a few points into persuade, you can get advances on quests or extra cash at the end without getting bad faction hits.  i ended chaotic good by the way (good 100)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">07-18-02, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, if you use the persuade skill (best skill, ever   ), you have the option of convincing them to pay you.<br />
<br />
If you use the other options, that's the evil part.  It actually says somewhere (maybe in a spoiler site...?) that there's tons of money to be made from shopkeepers and whomever by demanding protection money from them if you're evil</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loreleli</div><div class="date">07-20-02, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nah, I'm not strong arming people for gold. I only asked for advances a few times in chap. 2.<br />
<br />
I have gotten options to extort money, lie, threaten a person when they yeild in battle, if they're good, I let them live.<br />
<br />
Halfway thru chap. 2, I wanted to get closer to true neutral &amp;amp; did for &quot;good&quot; quests without asking for a reward, no faction change.<br />
<br />
I really don't see a neutral happening in this game. <br />
<br />
In several of the NWN sites, I see references to gold = evil, pretty sad and IMHO, a sad cheap out to make people &quot;play nice-nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
If anything, my character is more choatic neutral than any other alignment. <br />
<br />
My faction has not changed neutral (50) evil (23) <br />

<br />
even when I healed the dude in the dungeon.<br />
<br />
I liek neutral, persuasive rogues. <br />
<br />
I played one in Arcanum as well. I like getting as much storyline and quests done on one play through, as I can rarely replay a game like this. <br />
<br />
And building a low hp, high dex wiht persuation is much more challanging then just a fight with huge hp. <br />
<br />
what even weirder, is Daelan is chaotic good  and likes me,  I 'm leaning towards bugged, as I had freeze ups halfway through game in chap 2 before I downloaded the latest patch.<br />
<br />
I even got the blank journal entry at end of chap 2, but was able to move onto chap 3. So, I may try playing with dm client out of desperation, because I refuse to go back 20+ game hours to re-do it.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hummerlein</div><div class="date">07-20-02, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">gold doesn't = evil.  i ended with 100 good and had thousands and thousands of gold.  you just can't threaten to break people's knuckles if they don't give you that extra 25 gold.  the rewards you get from that kind of stuff isn't worth it at all, it's such a small amount.<br />
<br />
and i used to lie a bit, i never got an evil faction hit from that    i think it just checks against your charisma, sort of like a ghetto persuade, but i'm not sure on that</div></div><hr />
