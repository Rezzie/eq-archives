<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aura</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you ever had one of those nights that xp just went right? That was last night for me. I realized just how uber blasters are when they're in the right group. Over the course of about 8 or a little fewer hours, I went from 22 to a little into 24. For the most part, it was myself and an RL friend of mine who had a 21 emp defender. With his damage buff, and heals, we were able to take out full groups of whites, yellows, and the occasional crowd of oranges (they were yellow, orange, and red to him) in Dark Astoria. Eventually, another RL friend's kinetics defender joined up. Why did we need a kinetics defender? Because the only downtime we had was running from group to group. It was rediculous. I was gaining more than a bubble ever half hour. (It makes me feel like a nerf for blasters' AoEs is coming on...) The defender reported gaining over 100,000xp in the night.<br />
<br />
Anyone else had a night like this? Where the group just worked out really well?</div></div><hr />

The majority of my SG are blasters.  Us two plus one or two of anyone else and we're off to the races.<br />
<br />
Groups of 4 have always given me better xp gains than 6-8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently have a tactic that allows myself and a real life friend to do groups of purples non-stop in IP.<br />
<br />
<br />
I find that when I add someone I don't know, and more particularly someone with whom I can not communicate with voice, people start dying (me in particular being the tank).<br />
<br />
So I know exactly where your coming from</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aura</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, we tried doing purples - but being that I (blaster) was our tank... it...um... didn't work. I jumped into a group of reds and did my badass thing. POW BLAST ZAP!! AOE, fire everywhere builduip, retarded damage. They kinda looked at me with the quarter of the health they had left after the assault... all raised guns and fired. My health literally went from full to nothing without stopping to catch its breath... No time for insps, no time for heal, just one VERY dead Tycho...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...and the tactic is........do share.  ;)<br />
<br />
A good group is key really, or at least one other person that know's what they're doing.  Last night Marbh and I ripped through three indoor missions.  On the last one everything was orange and red to me, with four purples also, and we did very well for ourselves (no deaths and decent time).  Just a scrapper and a tanker, but we know our classes and know each other's styles pretty well.  For me the experience flowed last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aura</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My tactic:<br />
<br />
I have 2 SO recharge reducs in my buildup<br />
My emp defender has 4 SO recharge reducs in his little infinite endurance spell... I can't go through all my endurance... it's awesome<br />
<br />
I charge in to a packed group, blow my buildup, and use all of the AoEs that I have... usually by the third, they're all dead. Being that I have infinite endurance most of the time, I just run to another group and repeat... it's crazy xp.<br />
<br />
**edit**Mixed up buildup and recharge... d'oh**edit*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe well I was referring to Alturick's tactic...but I am always interested in enhancement setups.  I'm envious of your inability to run out of endurance.  On my scrapper I run through it pretty quickly...but then again I've loaded my main two attacks with more power than endurance reducers.</div></div><hr />
