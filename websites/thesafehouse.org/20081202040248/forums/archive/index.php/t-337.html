<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tulvas</div><div class="date">05-04-00, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems rogue have the odd &quot;skill&quot;, if thats what you would call it, to easily steal kills at times.  When i was lvl 19 i was in the warrior room in High Keep talkin to a friend when, obviously, a warrior spawned.  He immediately attacked me but then they started whackin him and he turned...i backstabbed once(for approx 60ish dmg) and then for the rest of the time i PPed.  Somehow i managed to steal the kill!!! And it was a full grp of at least 25+ heh.  Took me a while to figure it out tho lol...my friend was like &quot;tulvas did you jus take that kill?&quot; &quot;no...&quot; i said....then i looked up and WHOA &quot;You have gained Experience!&quot; hehe<br />
<br />
Another time there was some wizard running around West Commons Kiting...not all that well i might add...it took her like 20 min..... a Hill Giant.  So of course like anyone's reaction to a pre-occupied giant i went up to it and started to Pick Pocket.  It wasn't til a little while later that i thought maybe she needed help so i backstabbed him a few times and ttacked him taking no more than 200dmg. When it came to the end of the battle of course i killed the HG gaining about 3/4 bub of exp(was lvl 29 at the time) and approx 8pp(he was a cheap one) and a lambent stone =)</div></div><hr />
