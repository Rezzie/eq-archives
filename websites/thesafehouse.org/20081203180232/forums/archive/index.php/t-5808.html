------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
** Gameplay Changes **<br />
<br />
- Aggro Changes:  We've made an adjustment to the way that NPCs choose their targets.  It's a rather simple change, one that makes a lot of sense.  But we want you to be aware of it so that it won't surprise you too much, and so that you won't think that it is a bug.  NPCs are now much more aware of the vulnerability (or, more precisely, the invulnerability) of their targets.  NPCs will now be very unlikely to waste their time attacking a target that they can't harm.<br />
<br />
- Spell and Item Interruption:  Ducking will now interrupt a spell instantly.  You will no longer be able to sit while using items or casting spells.  This will not affect bard songs, which will still work as they always have, but will affect all items, even those with song-like effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spell Changes **<br />
<br />
- Skin Like Nature and Natureskin should stack with more spells now (though not with each other).<br />
<br />
- Aegolism can now be clicked off.<br />
<br />
- Imbue Ivory has had its casting level lowered to 29.<br />
<br />
- Shard of the Core will be tradable now.<br />
<br />
- Shroud of Hate and Visions of Grandeur should stack properly now.<br />
<br />
- Several new Translocation spells have been added.<br />
<br />
- Call of the Hero will no longer remove the target from NPCs' hatelists if the target is not summoned far enough.<br />
<br />
- Egress will now work indoors.<br />
<br />
- Wind of the North, Wind of the South, Markar's Relocation and Tishan's Relocation have had their additional restrictions removed, and can now be cast from any zone where other similar spells can be cast.<br />
<br />
- Summon Companion can now be used by Necromancers, Shamans, Enchanters, Shadowknights in addition to Magicians.<br />
<br />
- Deadeye should now stack with Dead Man Floating, but should not stack with Acumen.<br />
<br />
- Plainsight will now stack with Dead Man Floating, but not with Acumen.<br />
<br />
- The Great Divide portal spells are now 39th level instead of 44th level.<br />
<br />
- Spirit of the Oak will no longer be overwritten by any beneficial spells.<br />
<br />
- Paralyzing Poison spells should no longer be broken by direct damage spells.<br />
<br />
- Hsagra's Wrath and Porlos' Fury now have a 5 second recast delay.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Item Changes **<br />
<br />
- The effect on the 10th ring should have fewer stacking conflicts with haste buffs. <br />
<br />
- The effect of the Monk epic, Celestial Tranquility, will stack with the higher end haste spells. Keep in mind - the highest haste will always win out.  This means that the spells will stack, the haste components will not.<br />
<br />
- Speed of the Shissar has had its duration increased from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.  This effect should no longer conflict with Call of Earth.<br />
<br />
- Bone Ring of Condemnation will no longer be usable in the secondary slot, it will only be wearable on the finger.<br />
<br />
- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look more unique.<br />
<br />
- Circlet of Shadow will no longer drop in-game.  The Circlet of Shadows, can now be found in its place.  This item differs from the original only in that it has a five-second casting time.  Existing Circlets of Shadow will retain the same functionality as before, though we may change existing Circlets at some future date.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Quest Changes **<br />
<br />
- King Tormax is now a little more particular about who he gives quests to.<br />
<br />
- The Iksar Shaman 6th Skull/cudgel quest should be working now. <br />
<br />
- Rumor has it that there is a new source for green dragon scales in Norrath.<br />
<br />
<br />
** PvP Changes **<br />
<br />
- If you go link dead on a PvP server and are killed you can still be looted.<br />
<br />
- When a player becomes invisible (or hides successfully) every other player that had them targeted will lose their target.  This is true for all servers, but has the greatest implications on PvP servers.  The use of spells that allow you to see through invisibility will prevent you from losing your target if that target hides or goes invisible.<br />
<br />
- Faction hits on Rallos Zek:  Killing a person in one of his or her home cities will cause a faction hit with residents of that city.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous **<br />
<br />
- We've addressed a lot of spelling and grammatical errors over the past few weeks.  For example we have corrected all misspellings of &quot;deity&quot; in messages to the player, changed Cantana to Cantata and others.<br />
<br />
- The 'Fab Four' in Dagnor's Cauldron will no longer assist Undertow Skeletons.<br />
 <br />
- Instill Doubt/Intimidation can no longer be used while sitting, and sitting after starting it will cancel it.<br />
 <br />
- Mastery of language skills now occurs at 100, not at 101.  This was a problem for masters of a language, since language skills could not go over 100.<br />
<br />
- The messages for eating and drinking now say &quot;Chomp... Chomp,&quot; or &quot;Glug... Glug...&quot; so that they can't be copied with emotes.<br />
<br />
- Helms on Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres should no longer block the first person view when in combat. <br />
<br />
- Sirens Grotto has been changed a bit.  It should be a more interesting zone now.<br />
<br />
<br />
** NOTE **<br />
<br />
Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers.  Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their home town.<br />

It lost most useability for aggro management - and depending on range also for pulling.<br />
<br />
Bane spells are nerfed - though that might not even have been needed with the CoH nerf.<br />
<br />
DA/harmshield tanking was nerfed - though depending on how this was done it might have some good sides (ie, if DA clears the clerics hatelist = less chance he/she will be clawed to death after it wears). I assume its only the invuln spells/song that are changed - if auto riposte/dodge means it goes after someone else thats another story altogether. Mikar Vicarious <br />

<br />
Read the whole sentence folks. How can you know how bad the nerf is if you haven't even played with the changed spell yet?<br />
<br />
How can you know what &quot;far enough&quot; is when the patch is just currently being done?<br />
<br />
*sigh* You really need to cool off and wait until you have played.<br />
This is just the same as the evade-nerf.. people whined and bitched and in reality it turned out far less severe than it sounded.</div></div><hr />

Lemme go cry because people actually have to tank Yelinak and Tormax now.   <br />

<br />
IE -- If the caster has see invis up, they will not loose their target.  I don't know about you, but PvP casters tend to have see-invis up whenever they can.  Hell, melee has that up whenever they can.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that if you ever had see invis up, you'd loose your target but it's just much easier to retarget when you can see him.<br />

<br />
ok...  so when a cleric has YOU targeted for a heal, and you evade, just as it lands does the cleric get a &quot;you need a target to cast this spell&quot; message?  Can you imagine the havoc that will create?  If you go third person during a fight you will see you do actually disappear if you evade.  If you lose target you need to reaquire, so no matter how fast you evade you will still be off the charts for your healer probably when you need it most.  All I can say is--<br />
<br />
Wow!  a challange! Woot!<br />

CoH is like FD.  Its a tool to assist (&amp;lt;-- Keyword) in pulling.  Pulling doesn't come to an end because of the loss of one tool.  It just means we have to think of new strategies.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and I know I've seen Verant do things I didn't agree with.  But to you who complain I ask this;  looking back on what the game was two years ago; can you honestly say that the game isn't 200% better overall for all of the changes they have made?

<br />
As I understand it, spells cast on a target that hides, will resolve normally. <br />
<br />
In PVP this means you can't wait for a caster to start casting then hide, and on all servers that you won't 'avoid' a heal.  Saevan J'Noir<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kuurus</div><div class="date">06-27-01, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People will learn to adjust.  They always do.  Once people get a feel for the range of CoH clearing aggro, it won't be a problem.  Worried about getting too close before the spell completes?  Try running the OTHER WAY away from the mage to ensure it clears aggro.  Certainly not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
This change is obviously in direct response to part of what Verant thought was an exploit against the fourth warder.  Staying within healing range, but being CoH'd to wipe aggro on the healer will no longer work.<br />
<br />
I doubt it will have a huge affect on pulling.  CoH is definitely a nice tool, but we managed to pull Planes without any lvl 55 mages pre-Kunark.  This will not devestate us any more than the supposed apocalypse that was being brought on by the &quot;nerf&quot; (and I use that term loosely), to Evade did.<br />
<br />
As Shadowcross said, at least wait until you use it to complain about it being the end of civilization as we know it, sheesh.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm damn happy with the patch.  Being able to port to EJ or SF from anywhere in Norrath rather than that wretched &quot;port to DL, run to Karnors, evac to EJ/SF&quot;, is a true blessing.<br />
<br />
It eliminates what I think we all hate about certain aspects of this game - wasting time getting to where you are hunting, rather than spending it hunting, for no discernible purpose. Kuurus IceBear<br />

Also it destroys the ability for the mage to call themselves to clear aggro after a pathing bug takes the pet on a trip around the zone. The worst thing is, unless they have made the range really small, is that it won't even fix the exploit. Taoxek Trickyhands51 Elementalist Solusek Ro</div></div><hr />

There is a small chance (but still a chance, even it's for a split second) that you will evade between the time that the healer selects you and casts the heal spell.<br />

OTOH, the Circlet of Shadow had it coming. Was I the ONLY one who thought that instant cast invis seemed a bit much? (Of course, knowing Verant, the new version has a 15 second casting time, but we can always hope they just adjusted it to the same deal as ordinary invis.)<br />
<br />
I'm also rather suprised to see no one commenting on this:<br />
<br />
&gt; Paralyzing Poison spells should no longer be broken by direct<br />
&gt; damage spells. <br />
<br />
This is like having pre-nerf root in a bottle. Sounds like a pretty powerful toy to me.</div></div><hr />

I really like this patch   <br />
<br />
By the way.. to the person complaining about the invisibility change.. evade dosn't actually hide you.<br />
<br />
As for the people complaining about the circlet of shadows -- the item is unbalancing on pvp servers, it should have been changed long ago.  With the new invisibility change, it's even more unbalancing.  Since see invis items for melees on sullon zek will be very rare for a long time, the circlet of shadows had to be changed to avoid insane exploiting.<br />

And?  If your healer is too stupid to notice &quot;You need to select a target to cast this spell&quot; then you need a new group.</div></div><hr />

We shall see how long before something gets changed and the circlet is no longer instant invis.  They made it so it wont drop anymore, but still people will be whining like crazy when they have to keep clicking on the person before they can attack.  =)<br />
<br />
Sad to hear abot the CotH nerf, although my mage only made it to lvl 52, then i pretty much quit him.  In the post 50 game, Mages had 2 big things going for them IMO:  Bad ass pets and CotH.  Now with the nerf of Coth i can only imagine how hard it may be to find a group/raid.  At least we still got our pets.  =)<br />
<br />
The helm fix in first person for the big races is a good thing, and something that has been needing done for a LONG time.  I remember playing a barb/shaman and that helm always showing up in your face just got plain annoying.<br />
<br />
Good patch?  probly... for most.  We shall wait and see the viability of the &quot;new&quot; CotH.  Hopefully its still somewhat important and necessary.<br />

<br />
And quite a few good improvements.<br />
<br />
Bottem line is, all the 'nerfs' were implimented because people were abusing things and VI simply fixed them so they couldn't be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arafain</div><div class="date">06-27-01, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things worry me about this patch...<br />
<br />
1.  I'm somewhat frightened at the question of how far VI considers &quot;far enough&quot; to be acceptable for an aggro-wipe COH.  Smart people would think, 'out of normal spell range', but I can't help but shudder at the possibility that you might have to get halfway across the zone from your target to wipe aggro.  The Z-axis thing worries me too.<br />
<br />
2.  The invulnerable-target nerf.  At first I just thought it would only affect DA, but according to another poster, the nerf was badly coded, and works like, 'If target's hp not going down, switch to new target'.  As nearly anyone can see, this would be devastating to all manner of things, from Rune to Nimble to a random string of successful ripostes.  I'm not too keen on the idea of mobs turning to chew on my cleric just because I got lucky and dodged a bunch of hits.  That's lame.  But, to be fair, I haven't seen any of this myself, just heard about it from people who apparently don't have to work the same hours I do.    -- Arafain Entreri, 57 Blackguard<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Thaelin</div><div class="date">06-27-01, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree. If the invulnerability change actually encompasses things like nimble and, more to the point, rune - then VI just handed us the best aggro management tool we could have dreamed of (while it lasts.) Just rune anybody you don't want to have taking hits.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt they could be that stupid, but then again it is VI we're talking about.<br />

<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
3rd Person view has never been reliable.  Ever.<br />
<br />
Those of us with two machines and 2 accounts can confirm that you are not really hidden.<br />
<br />
Just ask other people in your group.  Easy enough for you to test.<br />
<br />
This little idiosyncrasy used to get me killed while pulling in Howling Stones a long time ago before I realized the problem.  I would &quot;hide&quot; right before the fight was over to go pull another mob, but since I had the current mob we were fighting targeted when I hit hide I really wasn't hidden.<br />
<br />
Moral is don't have any mobs targeted when you go to hide yourself, in case you've been flagged with aggro.  Target self or clear target first and it's fine.</div></div><hr />
