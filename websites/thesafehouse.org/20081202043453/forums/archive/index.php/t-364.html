<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">06-06-00, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, go to the gameplay forum and look for the post about funny begging stories. I'd post the link, but I copied one of the stories so I could post it here. Anywa I only read a few of them, but read this one its absolutely hilarious:<br />
<br />
As a High-Elven Magician, I am never without my faithful Jabober following me. I have never been to the Kelething bank (NEVER) without someone asking me for SoW or Clarity. Once, someone even asked my pet for a teleport(no joke). <br />
<br />
It is reasonable to mistakenly ask a Shamans pet for SoW or a tele seeing as most druids of high-level are always in wolfform(sp?), but when the pet in question is a level 20 fire elemental, you have to wonder. <br />
<br />
Idiot:&quot;Hey Jabober, youre red to me. Teleport me to the Dreadlands&quot;.<br />
<br />
Solefarin before I realise hes talking to my pet) &quot;Why do you want to go to Dreadlands? Youre level 1. You'll just die. Heck, I would die if I wasnt really carefull.&quot;<br />
<br />
Idiot:&quot;Who asked you dumb Mage, i was asking Jabober here, coz hes red to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Solefarin:&quot;Well then, red people are gods arent they.&quot;<br />
<br />
Idiot:&quot;Yes, because they can do anything and I can command them at my will&quot;<br />
<br />
Solefarin:&quot;What do I con to you my little friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Idiot:&quot;Red. SoW and Clarity me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Solefarin:&quot;I am a Magician, and even if I WERE a Druid/Shaman AND Enchanter at the same time I wouldnt help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Idiot:&quot;Go away Solefarin, I was talking to Jabober. Jabober, tele me to the Dreadlands now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Solefarin:&quot;Are you aware that Jabober is my pet&quot;<br />
<br />
Idiot:&quot;Yes, hes your pet in the same way hes my pet, I can command him to teleport me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Solefarin:&quot;No, not quite that way, hes my pet, I summoned him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Idiot:&quot;UNFAIR! So what if YOU told him first, I want him to tele ME&quot;<br />
<br />
Solefarin:&quot;Are you dumb? Blind? Hes my pet, a mindless blob of flames I conjured from nothing. He cant cast spells other than his damage shiled which is self only and his dd which would kill you in one hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Idiot:&quot;Why do you think you know so much about him? I know Jabober as well as you do dumba**&quot;<br />
<br />
Solefarin:&quot;Ok, Ill have him teleport you. Select me and type /du please, it will allow me to command him to teleport you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Idiot:&quot;Ok&quot;(actually does it)<br />
<br />
Jabober begins to cast a spell.....<br />
Idiot bursts into flame.<br />
Idiot has been slain by Jabober.<br />
<br />
Served him right.[i]<br />
<br />
Well I think this is my favorite part:<br />
<br />
[i]Idiot:&quot;Red. SoW and Clarity me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Solefarin:&quot;I am a Magician, and even if I WERE a Druid/Shaman AND Enchanter at the same time I wouldnt help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kodak moment?<br />
<br />
<br />

Despite the fact that they are insanely powerful and useful, again stressing that we will have to be very careful implementing poison to insure that we don't severly overpower them, there are still a LOT of people out there who think that rogues are useless.- Abashi</div></div><hr />
