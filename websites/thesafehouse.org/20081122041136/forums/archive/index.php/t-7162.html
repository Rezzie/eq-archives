Pretty fast work. Oh and the frog's owner is know for being able to xp very very fast and is in Harmonium, who are Xev's strongest uber guild.<br />
<br />
Personally I think it's pretty cool. Had to take some planing to get all that's needed for the epic before LoY, get gear, and so forth. I mean how many people can say they went and farmed the new zones when they came out? A lot. It's what everyone tries to do, it's practically mandatory. How many people can say they made a froglok with a name like Croakz, Hopperz, or Budwieser? A lot. How many people can say they spent 3 days getting the first 65th lvl froglok? One (plus the 10+ helpers for lvls 1-46). So good show Faahy and congrats on the frog!</div></div><hr />
