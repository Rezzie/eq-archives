<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">04-30-03, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ICV2.com has posted an article by Ryan Dancey on his views about the future of the d20 system.  Ryan Dancey is the CEO of Organized Play, best (or only) known for &quot;Living City ,&quot; the granddaddy of &quot;Living&quot; campaigns, and is a former VP at WOTC.<br />
<br />
Read his thoughts here (if you're interested, of course   ).<br />
<br />
The thing that surprised me the most was the 100,000 copies of the PHB sold in 2002.  That's astounding.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, I've been pretty lucky at the quality of the d20 stuff I've picked up and played.  I certainly hope that the industry doesn't go the route of selling PDF files.  That would be the death of the FLGS, assuming they didn't do some kind of licesning arrangement for local stores to print out the files on a per-use basis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PDF Files are currently a good output for smaller designers who don't have the money to create a print product their first time about. But print products will still be around for a long while to go, that is still where most people spend their gaming dollar.</div></div><hr />
