Now, as I understand there's supposed to me some kind of dialog between Aribeth and the baddies, but regardless of how long I wait or if I clear the room nearby with the golem in it, nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Anyone else had this problem? I'd hate to have to start again. DWF RNG/ROG rocks   <br />
