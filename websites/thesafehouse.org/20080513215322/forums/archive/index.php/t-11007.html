The download is taking forever, seems like it's stuck on calculating at the moment.  The item wipe sucks too (some stuff is still there, a key, shaman totems, hearthstones), I think I'm just going to start a new character.   You do get paid according to your level. <br />
Items Deleted<br />
With a few exceptions, all items and currency are being deleted for this patch. The following items will not be deleted: Bags, Scarlet Key, all Shaman Totems and the Hearthstone. Each character will be assigned funds based on their level.<br />
<br />
Players will be able to redo quests that have already been completed in order to gain back quest items.<br />
<br />
Quests Reset<br />
All quest progress for existing characters has been reset. Characters have the ability to go back and redo all quests if they wish. For players that were in the middle of a quest chain, those quests will need to be restarted from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Quests were reset to allow players the means for reacquiring lost quest items and to participate in the many quests that have been fixed and rebalanced. <br />
<br />
They changed the Rest system to make it only 3 different states, etc.<br />
The Rest State system has undergone several changes. There are now three tiers of rest states: Rested = 200% experience, Normal = 150% experience and Tired = 100% experience.<br />
<br />
The rest timer is much more flexible than before, allowing players to gradually accumulate incremental rest credit for all time spent logged out. Additionally, people who do not log into World of Warcraft for several days will gain bonus rest credit. This will allow those who only play once or twice a week the added bonus of playing as rested (200% experience) for longer periods of time than those who play on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
Players also have the ability to rest anywhere in the world. This should help players who forget or choose not to log off at an inn. Resting at an inn is still the preferred method, as rest credit will accumulate four times faster for players logged off inside of an inn.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the Rest State modifier is now level-based using a sliding scale to determine how much experience you can gain at each tier instead of the previous flat 20,000 experience per level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morganne</div><div class="date">06-15-04, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall I believe it's a good patch for rogues...<br />
Although from what I can see it increased a lot of the rogue's dmg sources which is only going to affect agro some more.  And I don't believe they changed feint or warrior's taunt... But if this worsens the rogue's agro management, you guys in the beta will let us know I'm sure.<br />
<br />
Also, I saw that deadly poison's effect was increased and it's cost reduced. I've searched a lil about this poison's description, but couldn't find anything. Can anyone tell me?<br />
<br />
Finally, a non-patch question: Poisons have both charges and a use timer once applied. So how often do u guys renew your poison stock? seeing they all have like 50+ charges, and each charge lasts like 30 minutes... Would seem to me like u can play for a few days before needed to renew. Right?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">06-15-04, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely not a few days before you renew.  I'm just starting poisons, but with the first beginner poisons, it has 30 charges, or lasts on your blade for 30min if they are not all used up.  I find the charges get used up very quickly, before the 30 min are up, and i need to reapply.  What's nice is you can do it to both blades, I haven't tried range stuff yet.  The only problem is, I don't really know when i do hit the enemy with poison, I don't really notice any effect, maybe I'm just missing the text from the battle when it scrolls by.</div></div><hr />
