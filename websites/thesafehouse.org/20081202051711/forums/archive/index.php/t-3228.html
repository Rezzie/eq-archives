<br />
I have been getting a consistently full house on my server as of late (repeat business too!), and that was with rev. 0.1 of the module my friend Dulidina and I have created.<br />
<br />
I have now put up Rev 0.2, which adds a whole lot of new areas/features.<br />
<br />
Module Name:<br />
 Unforgiving Realms rev 0.2<br />
Type:<br />
Action<br />
Server Name: (currently)<br />
Torch's Server<br />
<br />
-  Dungeon layout added, not populated<br />
-  Low level PvM added, populated<br />
-  Player Social Inn area added, sparsely populated<br />
-  Non-PVP rest areas within the PvP Zone &quot;Killing Fields&quot;<br />
-  Semi-&quot;scripted&quot; boss event<br />
-  Lord Torath'telek waits to gobble groups of adventurers at end of dungeon<br />
<br />
and some ambiance/bug fixes<br />
<br />
-  Doors automatically close after a period of time<br />
-  Initially locked doors will automatically re-lock after the door closes after a period of time.<br />
-  Sounds and other ambience added to areas<br />
-  Experience rate reduced (people were gaining 6 levels in a few hours)<br />
-  Map Pins added to the main Experience Forest area and the Killing Fields PvP area<br />
-  Players respawn at beginning of module (will work on adding alternate bind positions in the near future)<br />
-  Level requirements for some zones.  Some zones you must be above a certain level to access, some zones you must be below a certain level to access.<br />
<br />
My high level monsters have been designed with the &quot;augmented&quot; high level Players in mind.  I.e. Solo, you will NOT be able to kill them, no matter how good your home-made gear might be.  The high level players that have come have stayed for hours because of this challenge.<br />
<br />
Come check it out, and please give me feedback, either via email or here at the Safehouse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now if the server app wouldn't crash every 7 hours (or more, or less) it would be nice.  I am tempted to bring up my slackware box to run the dedicated, but its a p2-400 with less ram, so I don't know if it would be better or worse.  I'm suspecting worse.<br />
<br />
my statement above about twinked chars not having much chance against the boss mobs has been proven wrong.  I need to implement the no-plot item code, or just switch over to server only chars....<br />
<br />
still need to put in more content for lower levels (or at least items/drops) when I go server only route.<br />

Keep up the good work!  Lots of people who join want to know the name of the mod so they can remember it.  Unforgiving Realms = rule!</div></div><hr />

The thing is that when I play, there is usually no one else on.  Makes some of these servers really challenging when you are the only one there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Liked your mod in general, but some things I noticed.<br />
<br />
1.  Sign to the lvl 7 and less area says lvl 7 or higher.<br />
2.  Very high agro mean badger (nutria?) mobs tend to swarm the entry point, and stay there.  Had to Zerg rush them get to lvl 2, died around 12 times doing so (Lvl 1 rogue heh.)<br />
3.  When mobs chase people back into the starting spot, they dont particularly care who they whack.  Little old me got to see the Skeleton Lord with his 2hander up close and personal, then respawned and got it again.  You might want to put the respawn point a little more out of the throughway.<br />
<br />
Really liked the steam and such in the Kitchen Basement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks!  <br />
<br />
Yeah we noticed some bugs with the low level area.  Mainly that the guard that is posted there wasn't doing her job of killing the mobs if they exited following a PC.  That has been fixed.<br />
<br />
It's kinda a crapshoot whether the mobs follow a player or not.  We haven't scripted what they should do when confronted with an area transition.  (not sure if it can be).<br />
<br />
The next rev will be brought up tonight or tomorrow.  a lot of tuning of encounters in the dungeon has been done and the above guard bug fix, and a few other bug fixes have been implemented.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">07-24-02, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nearly complete now....<br />
<br />
The latest revision 0.3d is up and running on the above mentioned server.<br />
<br />
-  Expanded Low Level area<br />
-  New scripted events for low and high level areas<br />
-  Fully Populated Dungeon with custom loot dropping<br />
-  Complete population of all areas meant to have mobs<br />
-  Access to dragon encounter is fully enabled<br />
-  New bind position for players who get close to the dragon encounter<br />
-  Tuned mob difficulties<br />
<br />
Currently, the boss mob that drops the key to gain access to the dragon quest has been killed once.  It took 3 people to do it.<br />
Come check it out.  Most players have enjoyed the module.  It is not for diablo hack-kids.<br />
<br />
It will go to server only characters once it has been finished.  Currently there are enough mobs to go from level 1 to level 20.  The level rate can put players up to level 20 within a few days of playing.  We want to expand it a bit more and add more loot and some more tuning before we change it.<br />
<br />
It will be uploaded to the safehouse website for review, along with NWvault.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-25-02, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so I take it from what others are saying you HAVE to be tweaked to play on this server? <br />
<br />
how tweaked higher levels or huge stats, or gear or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">07-25-02, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you don't have to be tweaked to play successfully.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of encounters for people with average gear.<br />
<br />
This is meant to be a multiplayer module, i.e. we did not intend every encounter to be beatable by a   single player.  There are numerous encounters which were designed for the solo player, but most of the boss mobs (we hope) will need a group (a few people) or a single tweaked player to succeed.<br />
<br />
There are some encounters designed specifically to be a challenge to players who have tweaked themselves.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully the new changes to how the servers handle illegal characters will allow us to tone those encounters down to a normal difficulty.  They are not the norm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gereint</div><div class="date">07-25-02, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really cool mod.  Played a bit with my lvl 20 fighter in the dungeon.  My god those sneak attack spiders are annoying.  I got as far as the Slaad King room before I decided to call it quits.  The mino guard respawned right after I managed to kill the assasin and get the magi solo.  He's one tough mofo.<br />
<br />
I'm definatly gonna keep playin on the server though.  My guys are Fei Fong Wong and Kiloph</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-25-02, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">errrr so should i NOT use a level one char I start in the mod? is there stuff I can whack or should I import a different char?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">07-25-02, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks  <br />
<br />
There are 2 areas for level 1 characters to fight.  They are inside the Flask of Azuth.  It seems their basement has a pest problem...  Then there is an outdoor area for level 7+ that will take you clear through your upper teens.<br />
<br />
The dungeon area starts off with mobs designed for players around level 8 or so.  There is no level restriction on entering the dungeon however.<br />
<br />
The Slaad King encounter is one of the hardest encounters you'll face.  There are more, likewise difficult encounters laying in wait after the Slaad King.<br />
