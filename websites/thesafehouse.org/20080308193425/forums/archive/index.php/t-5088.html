<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xetrin the Blackguard</div><div class="date">06-03-02, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was considering autotraining stealth all the way up to level 48, or 40 if I just can't handle 48 =P.  In doing so I figure I'd free up enough points to get:<br />
40 CS<br />
40 Envenom<br />
40 Swords<br />
40 Stealth<br />
I'd have enough points left to raise any skill twice or two skills once, so what would be best in terms of maxing it later on?<br />
Would it be possible to max the 4 skills with items/realm ranks, with them at 40? or would it be unbelievably difficult, and max-wise, would there be a close but better pattern to take?<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
I forgot the whole 50.5 thing, so actually, I wouldn't need to autotrain stealth to 48, just to 40, and I could get one skill to 42. Xetrin--60th Assassin of the Tribunal<br />

I still would not auro-train stealth to 48.  That would be just painful.  I autotrained it to 24, wasn't too bad, but even at that level the lack of stealth was driving me nuts.  I can't imagine going through the long levelling of the 40's with poor stealth.<br />
<br />
If you know you will always have groups around and be able to get to them maybe it won't be so bad, but if you need to do some soloing or move around in dungeons to get to hunting spots you may need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xetrin the Blackguard</div><div class="date">06-04-02, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any idea what skills I might want to keep at 39? or which I might want to raise to 41 then?

<br />
38 would be rr3&amp;lt;60k rp&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
stealth around 40 is also overrated,as the same thing applies,you can get stealth to 37 or so,and use the same rules.<br />
<br />
along with that,you might want to consider taking cs to 44,for the 3rd part of the hamstring chain,isnt alot of incentive.<br />
<br />
one other alternative is taking sword to 50,for the back positional style,anytime use&amp;lt;im not sure how good it is&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Windaria Chopsalot</div><div class="date">06-06-02, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want a crit blade, my suggestion is you start by making an LA/Envenom/Axe heavy character. Then respecing once you get to Rvr Levels. Auto training stealth is really not viable for a CS SB unless your being PL'd. If you don't have stealth there is no reason to train CS.<br />
<br />
I am very happy with my PVE abilities even with the bonus of Double Frost being reduced from +300% to +200% of base. I would choose Norse as a race, the benefits of Dex/Quick are not out wieghed by what Con (hps &amp;amp; damage reduction) and str offer. Also putting creation points into Con (15) and str (10). For spec Max LA, divide remaining points between Envenom and Axe evenly. Stop once you reach the template max and start saving points for stealth.<br />
<br />
What you end up with in PVE, is a character that is easier to level. This means you will more likely get into Rvr fucntional levels faster before burning out. You can solo (piercing opponants), you can tank (piercing opponants, or Slash/Crush if you max those resistances) , and you add alot of group benefits with damage being greater than a berzerker (w/ poisens).<br />
<br />
The exp rate gained is great because you kill things so fast. You can respec to what you want to be in Rvr later and be the best you can be in Pve now.<br />
<br />
Although you will see pure SZ's posting they are not happy now. If you have envenom skill you are still viable. Really as a melee class you will only be rivaled by Armsman, Hero, and Infiltrators.<br />
<br />
Currently (at 47): 44LA, 36 Evenom, 29 Axe, 21 CS (opps)<br />
At level 48: 44LA, 36 Evenom, 29 Axe, 21 CS, 36 stealth<br />
At level 50: 44LA, 36 Evenom, 39 Axe, 21 CS, 36 stealth<br />
<br />
Not sure what I will do at respec if anything. The main thing is I have enjoyed leveling this character. That can not really be said for my 50 level of being a Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AGLuhowy</div><div class="date">06-18-02, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">stealth at 35, envenom at 36 is all you need to get to 50<br />
<br />
auto train to 24, cause after that it is just too painful, and at 24 you will have saved 20 points.<br />
<br />
get 39 cs and balance to weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_wilder345</div><div class="date">06-27-02, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lot's of good info so far, except whoever said to take cs to 50, that's a bad idea IMO.<br />
<br />
you're looking at 40st,40cs,40en,40sw<br />
<br />
my thoughts:<br />
<br />
stealth: 36 is all the stealth you need, +11 items +3 from RR gets you 50 eventually and anything over that is pretty well agreed upon as useless.<br />
<br />
cs: whatever you take it to, unless you've just got extra points to burn stop it right after a new attack skill, i.e. 34 for creeping death (good) or 39 for stunning stab (ss said to suck, but can get cs to 50 w/ bonuses.)<br />
<br />
en: my considered opinion is that 29 is where to stop env; w/ bonuses you get the 40 DOT.  i think this is the best bang for the buck.  taking it above 29 you have to go all the way to 34 just to get the next usefel (forget the 42 snare) poison, the 45 DOT.  above that you do get a new DOT, disease and weakening poison from base env 38 (9 items, +3 RR = 50) but they're not all that much better than the 2nd best poisons and not worth the points IMO.<br />
<br />
sw: w/ 39 base in sw (or main weap) you can get to 50, yes.  most ppl agree that weapon spec &gt; 50 is more beneficial than cs &gt; 50, i certainly do from all i've read.  for one thing, if your weap spec &amp;lt; 50 w/ bonuses your damage will range from 75%-125%, if its &gt;= 50 w/ bonuses you get 100%-150%, that's a difference on every swing of 25%.  furthermore, if you have a sw spec at 47 or more you can get to 50 w/ just RR and maybe at the beginning a little sw bonus.  if you need +9 or +11 sw items to get to 50 you'll end up using a dropped sword to get the sword bonus needed to raise spec to 50.  drops are often qual 89%, vs. player crafted weaps which can be qual 99%, that's again a dif. of 10% damage on every swing; and that's a big dif.<br />
<br />
this said i'm looking at a critblade template of:<br />
<br />
st: 36<br />
cs: 44<br />
sw: 47<br />
en: 29<br />
<br />
38 points leftover (i think, char builder is down.)  i'm not getting the last point in stealth until i see how i like this build, b/c already it would take the 2 promised respecs to go to my 2nd favorite template (5-spec: 39ax,39la,34cs,29en,36st) <br />
