<br />
Not really. There have been anime review podcasts b4. The only difference is this one is well funded and has some inside connections but thats about it. <br />
<br />
And way to rope ppl into watching by showing the first showing of the dubs lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">02-20-07, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Haruhi Suzumiya dub segments are on youtube seperately, so you don't have to witness the horror of Anime tv to see them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-20-07, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm not so interested in watching the Haruhi segments, considering I have some of the DVD's on R2. I was wondering what the show was like, given they chose a rather otaku-ish title as their first review. I had hoped they had closed captioning since a good amount of shows have them, but I guess since it's not on TV there is no need.<br />
<br />
But apparently, I'm retaining my sanity by not having to watch AnimeTV, so all is right with the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">02-20-07, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">JYB mainly just introduced the segments, while a group of stereotype twenty-somethings (fanboy, fangirl, criticboy, criticgirl,...) sat around the table talking about how awesome/awful the show was.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">02-21-07, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On youtube Animetv episode1 is in two parts, part 1 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf9I5tjRtag) and part 2 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfAeS0rpYGQ).<br />
<br />
Here's the youtube video of all the dub segments (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtGYqqTcKn0) stuck together.  It's hard not to think of all the other characters those voices have been used for.  :nerd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">02-21-07, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just watched the episode and there were a few things I didn't like about it.<br />
<br />
First and most important was the director.  I could see him in the control booth going &quot;Okay, ready camera one, go on camera one! Okay, we've done that shot for two seconds, ready camera two - go on camera two!  Okay, five seconds this time, now go back to camera one!  Okay, three second on that shot, ready camera three - go on camera three!...&quot;  He probably lost is voice calling out all those camera changes over the course of the fifteen minutes or so. <br />
<br />
In the second half of the show I started counting how long each shot was being held and I rarely got above six seconds, with the longest at ten seconds. I replayed a portion of the show and listened to it instead of watching it and found it was much better - I could concentrate on what the people were saying instead of the visual changes.  Also, get mics on each reviewer instead of a group mic - some of the reviewers have lower/quieter voices than others.  And clear all that crap off the table - the guys can go fifteen minutes without a drink, and if it's product placement then one of each drink is fine.<br />
<br />
Second was the fact that there were a bunch of people talking about one anime for fifteen minutes.  I think instead they should review two or three anime with one of the reviewers taking the intro portion which describes the show and what they liked and disliked, then have the rest of the crew either agree or disagree with him/her and bring up other points the reviewer might have missed.  Jonny Bosch might want to play a bigger part in moderation (and get the hell off that highchair and onto the sofa with the other guys).  Essentially, the director should watch Ebert &amp; Roeper and rip off as much as he can from that reviews show.<br />
<br />
Last was their list of top anime.  5, Mononoke, 4. Spirited Away, 3. Howl's Moving Castle, 2. Evangelion, 1. Bleach.<br />
<br />
Aside from my personal opinion that movies and series shouldn't be judged together, Bleach has no business being number one, and I can think of many better anime that could be put on the list instead of Howl's and Bleach.  Not saying either are bad, they're just not two of the three best anime ever made.  Spirited Away has no business being as low as number four either.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I don't think they should have the viewer ratings at the end - it'll encourage people to praise or bash an anime just to get their post on the show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have to remember that one of the ppl that are in the reviewing team comes from Euraka 7 VAing...That being said (I have not seen it yet) but IMHO they are really action fans and are bias toward that type. They are the example of the &quot;typical&quot; (you know the hyperactive OMFG THIS IS TEH SHIZNET! etc etc) anime fan who are more interested in production values and action...they also seem to like FTW/FTY type stuff.</div></div><hr />

Ya the VA cast is good. But really come on how can they go wrong with class A VA acting and the amount of $$ the company is shelling out for em..<br />
<br />
Altho Mikuru VA sounds almost exactly like the japanese one but in english O.o heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-21-07, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That top 5 list is the strangest list I've ever seen. It can't possibly be polled, because Naruto and One Piece would have beaten everything else on the list. It can't be a hardcore list, because no hardcore fan would dare put Bleach anywhere near their top 20.<br />
<br />
It's almost like they went &quot;ok, let's add Bleach to attract the casual fans, Evangelion to attract the semi-hardcore fans, then arbituarily added the last 3 hoping it would give them a air of elitism.<br />
<br />
Very strange. But I really have a hard time taking anyone seriously on a top 10 list, it's highly personal thing. You're either in the camp that supports the list, or not.<br />
<br />
That being said, my #1 favorite is Gun-do Musashi, #2 Mahou Sensei Negima S1, #3 Macross II, #4 Sister Princess!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">02-21-07, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: I don't have a top ten list!<br />

I like some, I don't like others, and I will always hate EVA. That's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-21-07, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I was kidding about the top 4 I listed, although they may qualify for an universal top 4 worst anime ever list.<br />
<br />
I'm the same way, I have things I like a hell of a lot (Haruhi, Macross SDF, Urusei Yatsura, Kodomo no Omocha, etc), stuff I love (Kaleido Star, Tsukuyomi, PlanetES, etc) and so on. No clear definition of 1-10. I don't really see much point either, what matters is whether you like it or not, not which is better than which.</div></div><hr />

I don't have a top 10 list either, but that's probably because I haven't seen enough yet to fill all the slots. (I have only seen about half a dozzen anime series so far, but I am working on it!) I did like NGE though. :)<br />

Dang, Stalk.  We have quite a few similiar tastes it seems.<br />
Must be why I love listening to your suggestions. :D</div></div><hr />

They tried some new stuff, but they still had a wierd list.<br />
