<br />
My TP generally hangs around 140 to 220% until I use it.<br />

I'm not certain, but it seems like the power increases only kick in at 200% and 300%. Amadan  ::  Child of the Phoenix  ::<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lerkin Behinja</div><div class="date">11-19-03, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think berael is correct.  This had confused me greatly, as I use(d) daggers.  The only thing that changes with higher TP with daggers is the poison length.  Since fights usually don't last too long, I find it best to just use Wasp Sting when I hit 100%.  With later weapon skills, however, there is a definite change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnmish Gearbinder</div><div class="date">11-20-03, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, my Thief is level 7 now and using Hand-to-Hand with Cat Baghnaks I wail when I use the Combo special. combo hits for like 36 when I'm at 300% now.<br />
<br />
Combo &gt; Wasp Sting<br />
<br />
I still keep my dagger skill up though just in case. Wasp Sting is so nearly useless that it's difficult to see the difference when you're in full 'Overdrive'.<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm calling TP 'Overdrive' from here on out. We all know that's what it is.  <br />

Got another question about Renkei (Skillchain).  How long do you guys generally wait between skills?  I think we do about a two-second count from the &quot;Expendable readies FlashyEffect.&quot; before using the next skill.  Anyone have any hard numbers or know from experience the time window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-23-03, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wait 2 to 3 seconds after I see their activation message.  &quot;Nothing in this world truly comes for free.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Absolute Master</div><div class="date">11-26-03, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda as an aside, but you won't see a good boost from the dagger skill as a thief until level 33 which is when you get your first weapon skill that stacks with Sneak Attack. Wasp Sting is so completly useless compared to the sword ws that has Fast Blade + Sneak Atttack, and h2h ws which has Combo + Sneak Attack. At least Gust Slash is fairly decent damage wise. I've been using dagger over sword since level 22 or so because while the dagger weapon skill at that level sucks, your dagger combat skill caps much higher then sword or Hand 2 Hand. You will end up doing more damage because you will be missing a lot less.<br />
<br />
There is a pretty long window between skill chains. I usually chain 2 seconds after the person before me used his.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ubernome</div><div class="date">12-04-03, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">here's a sure-fire template for skillchain macro:<br />
<br />
/wait 3<br />
/ws &quot;Weapon Skill&quot; &amp;lt;bt&gt;(or &amp;lt;t&gt;)<br />
<br />
press as soon as you see &quot;Soandso readies Weaponskill&quot;<br />
<br />
If you can't keep up with the battle spam, try:<br />
<br />
/wait 2<br />
/ws &quot;Weapon Skill&quot; &amp;lt;bt&gt;(or &amp;lt;t&gt;)<br />
<br />
press as soon as you see your buddy's weaponskill animation<br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
For Skillchain: Detonation<br />
A warrior readies Raging Axe, you hit your macro <br />
/wait 3<br />
/ws &quot;Gust Slash&quot; &amp;lt;bt&gt;<br />
/party Using Gust Slash on &amp;lt;bt&gt;!<br />
<br />
In addition, if your party has a monk that can perform One Inch Punch, you get to have Gravitation as your 2nd chain.....annnnnd, if your party has a mage that can cast Earth or Dark spells, you get a Magic Burst for even more damage.</div></div><hr />
